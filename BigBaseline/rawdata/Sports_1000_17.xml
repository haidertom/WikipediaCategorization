==[[Boxing]]==
'''Events'''
* 1756 — Bill "The Nailer " Stevens defeated a number of unnamed opponents until 1759.&lt;ref name=BS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/stevens-williams.htm |title=Bill Stevens |publisher=Cyber Boxing Zone |accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1757 — George Taylor defeated [[Tom Faulkner]] twice.&lt;ref name=GT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/taylor-george.htm |title=George Taylor |publisher=Cyber Boxing Zone |accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 6 August 1758 — Faulkner defeated Taylor in the 26th round after 1 hour 15 minutes of a fight at [[St. Alban's]]. Faulkner claimed the title after the bout.&lt;ref name=GT/&gt;
* 20 October 1759 — Jack Slack v Jack Moreton at [[Acton, London|Acton Wells]]. Slack won after 35 minutes.&lt;ref name=JS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/slack-jack.htm |title=Jack Slack |publisher=Cyber Boxing Zone |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 19 February 1760 — Bill " The Nailer " Stevens defeated Jacob Taplin in 13 round fight lasting 30 minutes at Marylebone Basin.&lt;ref name=BS/&gt; 
* 17 June 1760 — Jack Slack was defeated by Bill "The Nailer" Stevens in the fourth round of a fight lasting 27 minutes; Slack retired from the ring soon afterwards to open a shop on Chandos Street, London. He lived there for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=JS/&gt;

==[[Cricket]]==
'''Events'''
* 1756 — Hambledon, almost certainly a local parish organisation at this time, played three matches against the prominent [[Dartford Cricket Club]].{{fact|date=July 2017}}
* 1757–1760 — Perhaps for the first time, cricket felt the full impact of a major war as it suffered a drain in manpower and investment during the [[Seven Years' War]] (to 1763); few first-class matches were recorded with none at all in 1760.{{fact|date=July 2017}}
* September 1759 — Three [[Dartford Cricket Club|Dartford]] v [[Non-international England cricket teams|Rest of England]] matches were played, a number of well-known names being involved; Dartford won the "series" 2–1.{{fact|date=July 2017}}
* c.1760 — It is about this time that [[pitched delivery bowling]] began; in turn, it necessitated the creation and deployment of the modern straight [[cricket bat|bat]], replacing the old "hockey stick" type which could not cope with a ball that bounced.{{fact|date=July 2017}}

==[[Golf]]==
'''Events'''
* 1758 — First codified ''Rules of Golf'' published by the St Andrews Golfers, later the [[Royal and Ancient Golf Club]].{{fact|date=July 2017}}

==[[Horse racing]]==
'''Events'''
* 1758 — The Society of Sportsmen of the [[Curragh]], a precursor of the [[Irish Turf Club]] was formed.{{fact|date=July 2017}}

'''1823 in sports''' describes the year's events in world sport.

==[[Boxing]]==
'''Events'''
* 20 May — [[Tom Spring]] is finally able to defend his English Championship title when he receives a challenge from Bill Neat.  The two meet on Hinckley Downs and the fight ends in the eighth round when Neat is forced to retire, having sustained a broken arm in the sixth round.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/spring-t.htm Cyber Boxing Zone – Tom Spring]&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Cricket]]==
'''Events'''
* The size of the [[wicket]] is increased to 27 x 8 inches.
'''England'''
* Most runs&lt;ref name="cards"&gt;Note that scorecards created in the first quarter of the 19th century are not necessarily accurate or complete; therefore any summary of runs, wickets or catches can only represent the '''known''' totals and the missing data prevents effective computation of averages&lt;/ref&gt; – [[William Ward (cricketer, born 1787)|William Ward]] 328 (HS 120)
* Most wickets&lt;ref name="cards"/&gt; – [[William Ashby (cricketer)|William Ashby]] 23 (BB 6–?)

==[[Football]]==
'''Events'''
* The traditional date of the [[William Webb Ellis]] legend.  He is the [[Rugby School]] pupil who, it is said, "with a fine disregard for the rules of football, took the ball in his hands and ran with it".  Even if the tale is true, the game will have been a version of folk football with rules that had been verbally agreed by the Rugby School pupils.  Such rules are always open to challenge and it may be that an incident like this did occur with the result that a "dribbling" game became primarily a handling game.

==[[Horse racing]]==
'''England'''
* [[1,000 Guineas Stakes]] – [[Zinc (horse)|Zinc]] 
* [[2,000 Guineas Stakes]] – Nicolo 
* [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]] – [[Emilius]]
* [[Epsom Oaks|The Oaks]] – [[Zinc (horse)|Zinc]] 
* [[St. Leger Stakes]] – [[Barefoot (horse)|Barefoot]]

The '''2009 Malmö Davis Cup riots''' were anti-[[Israel]] riots in the Swedish city of [[Malmö]] against a [[Davis Cup]] tennis match [[2009 Davis Cup World Group#Sweden vs. Israel|between Sweden and Israel]] on 7 March 2009.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Anti-Israel protest staged at Sweden tennis match|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sweden-davis-protests-idUSTRE5261R220090307|publisher=Reuters|date=7 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AlJazeera"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Anti-Israel protest turns violent|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2009/03/200937141836935467.html|work=Al Jazeera|date=7 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In February, the tennis match had been decided by Malmö's [[Red-Greens (Sweden)|red-green]] city coalition to be closed to the public, a decision that was heavily criticised by the [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF).&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Sweden-Israel Davis Cup to go ahead without public|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/sports/24iht-tennisdavis24.20403874.html|work=The New York Times|date=24 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Owen|last=Gibson|title=Fans banned from Israel's Davis cup tie |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/feb/28/tennis-israel-gaza-davis-cup|work=The Guardian|date=28 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mayor of Malmö, [[Ilmar Reepalu]] personally said he thought the game should not be played at all, and the decision was thus considered to be more politically motivated than out of security concerns.&lt;ref name="AlJazeera"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Davis Cup Double Fault: Israel-Sweden Fan Lockout Stirs Controversy|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/davis-cup-double-fault-israel-sweden-fan-lockout-stirs-controversy-a-611738.html|work=Der Spiegel|date=6 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Riots==
In anticipation of protests around 1,000 police officers sanctioned off a large area around the Baltic Hall tennis stadium to keep protesters and rioters away.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt; A reported 170 truck loads of pavement stones were transported out of the area before the protests, and three schools were closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Ole|last=Rothenborg|title=Stenhögar kan stoppa polisinsatsen|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/stenhogar-kan-stoppa-polisinsatsen/|work=Dagens Nyheter|date=4 March 2009|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, for the first time in history, riot vehicles were brought in from [[Denmark]].&lt;ref name="AlJazeera"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VG"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Jacob|last=Lund|title=Frykter sammenstøt i Sverige|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/sverige/frykter-sammenstoet-i-sverige/a/551211/|work=Verdens Gang|date=7 March 2009|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The match was initially met with protest of around 6,000 to 7,000 anti-Israel demonstrators, with speeches held by the leader of the [[Left Party (Sweden)|Left Party]], [[Lars Ohly]], who while wearing a Palestinian scarf was seen holding a map of Palestine with Israel eradicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Karl-Johan|last=Karlsson|title=Här raderar Lars Ohly Israel|url=http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/har-raderar-lars-ohly-israel/|work=Expressen|date=27 February 2010|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Demonstranterna till attack mot polisen i Malmö|url=http://www.expressen.se/kvp/demonstranterna-till-attack-mot-polisen-i-malmo/|publisher=Expressen/TT|date=7 March 2009|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstrators were joined by several hundred militants of which around 200 to 300 began attacking police with stones, fireworks and paint bombs.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AlJazeera"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Pål|last=Stokka|title=Anti-israelsk demonstrasjon sporet av i Malmø|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2009/03/07/nyheter/utenriks/sverige/5181651/?www=1|work=Dagbladet|date=7 March 2009|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-Israel rioters included [[Antifascistisk Aktion|AFA]] [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascists]], militant [[Islamism|Islamists]], organised [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first1=Linda|last1=Hjertén|first2=Per-Ola|last2=Ohlsson|title=100 omhändertagna efter demonstrationen|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article11689300.ab|work=Aftonbladet|language=Swedish|date=7 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Godmorgon, världen!: Söndag 8 mars|url=https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=438&amp;artikel=2682135|publisher=Sveriges Radio|date=6 March 2009|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=David Nannini|last=Nilsson|title=Nazister väntas till tennismatch|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article11685560.ab|work=Aftonbladet|date=5 March 2009|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Daniel|last=Poohl|title=Nazister i demonstration mot Davis Cup-match|url=http://expo.se/2009/nazister-i-demonstration-mot-davis-cup-match_2482.html|publisher=Expo|date=5 March 2009|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as activists from neighbouring countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Richard|last=Lööf|title=SVT:s Richard Lööf rapporterar: "Malmö sämsta tänkbara för högriskmatch"|url=http://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/svt-s-richard-loof-rapporterar-malmo-samsta-tankbara-for-hogriskmatch|publisher=SVT|date=6 March 2009|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Kenan|last=Habul|title=De vill göra allt för att stoppa matchen|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/malmo/de-vill-gora-allt-for-att-stoppa-matchen/|work=Sydsvenskan|date=7 March 2009|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police eventually detained around 100 rioters, arresting ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Swedish teen jailed for Davis Cup protest|url=http://www.jta.org/2009/04/29/news-opinion/world/swedish-teen-jailed-for-davis-cup-protest|publisher=JTA|date=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional eighteen rioters were later identified and put on trial for their part in the riots,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Polis angreps av autonoma aktivister vid Davis Cup-match|url=http://www.sakerhetspolisen.se/publikationer/fallstudier-och-artiklar-fran-arsbocker/politisk-extremism/-polis-angreps-av-autonoma-aktivister-vid-davis-cup-match.html|publisher=[[Swedish Security Service]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with several convictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Daniel|last=Persson|title=Fängelse för tenniskravaller|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/malmo/fangelse-for-tenniskravaller/|work=Sydsvenskan|date=29 April 2009|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Fortsatt rättegång om tennisbråk|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/malmo/fortsatt-rattegang-om-tennisbrak/|publisher=Sydsvenskan/TT|date=2 June 2009|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Mikael|last=Funke|title=Fängelse efter tenniskravaller|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/malmo/fangelse-efter-tenniskravaller/|work=Sydsvenskan|date=25 February 2010|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Joakim|last=Palmkvist|title=Tre tonåringar dömda för Davis Cup-kravaller|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/malmo/tre-tonaringar-domda-for-davis-cup-kravaller/|date=10 September 2010|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The decision to close the tennis match to the public resulted in Malmö being banned from hosting tennis matches by the ITF for five years.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Sweden punished for Israel Davis Cup lockout|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/daviscup/5095836/Sweden-punished-for-Israel-Davis-Cup-lockout.html|work=The Telegraph|date=2 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to having to provide $15,000 in minimum gate receipts for the match, the Swedish Tennis Association was fined an additional $25,000.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; The [[Swedish Tennis Association]] responded by issuing penalties to Malmö mayor Ilmar Reepalu for his involvement in the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Federico|last=Moreno|title=Tennisförbundet skickar ny nota till Reepalu|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/malmo/tennisforbundet-skickar-ny-nota-till-reepalu/|work=Sydsvenskan|date=21 April 2010|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protest and riots led to accusations of [[antisemitism]] in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Sverige anklagas för antisemitism|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/malmo/sverige-anklagas-for-antisemitism/|publisher=Sydsvenskan/TT|date=9 March 2009|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Anna|last=Ekström|title="Politiker måste agera mot antisemitism"|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/opinion/aktuella-fragor/politiker-maste-agera-mot-antisemitism/|publisher=Sydsvenskan|date=14 March 2009|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedish history professor [[Kristian Gerner]] described the situation as "the worst crisis for Jews in Sweden since the Second World War."&lt;ref name="VG"/&gt;

A 2012 European Men's Handball Championship [[2012 European Men's Handball Championship qualification#Group 4|qualifier between Sweden and Israel]] set to be played in [[Karlskrona]] in June 2011 raised concerns due to the riots, and was considered to be moved to another location by Swedish sports authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Oro i Karlskrona för nya kravaller|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/handboll/article12425388.ab|publisher=Aftonbladet/TT|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Politiker rädda för Israelkravaller|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/sport/handboll/politiker-radda-for-israelkravaller/|publisher=Sydsvenskan/TT|date=21 April 2010|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The match was played as scheduled, with a minor anti-Israel demonstration being held.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Sweden-Israel Handball Game Sparks anti-Israel Protests|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/sweden-israel-handball-game-sparks-anti-israel-protests-1.367327|work=The Associated Press and Anna Ekström|publisher=Haaretz|date=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''welfare of animals in rodeo''' has been a topic of discussion for the industry, the public, and the law for decades.  Protests were first raised in the 1870s, and, in the middle twentieth century, laws were enacted to curb events using animals.&lt;ref name="Westermeier: 436"&gt;[[#Westermeier|Westermeier]]: 436&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[American Humane Association]] (AHA) has worked with the rodeo industry (specifically, the [[Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association|PRCA]]) to establish rules improving [[animal welfare]] in rodeo and the treatment of rodeo animals.

Today, animal cruelty complaints in rodeo are still very much alive.  The PRCA (which governs about a third of the rodeos conducted in the United States annually) has provided rules for its members regarding [[animal welfare]].  However the concept of rodeo has changed from year to year, derving from the amount of people not in the event increasing. Some local rodeos have banned the use of certain rodeo tack including [[flank strap]]s and certain events such as [[steer tripping]].  Some ''[[charreada]]'' events staged in the United States saw a crack down in the early years of the twenty-first century.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;[[#Brown|Brown]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
James Serpell stated in his ''In the Company of Animals'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is perhaps exaggerated to claim, as one author has, that the rodeo is 'the modern equivalent of the public hanging'. Nevertheless, these performances hinge on the violent subjugation of living animals, some of which are deliberately incited to frenzied violence by raking them with spurs, constricting the genital region with leather straps, or by thrusting an electric prod into the rectal area. At the same time they are often given bogus, malevolent names in order to deflect sympathy from their plight. Occasionally, they are maimed or killed, and many are forced to undergo the same terrifying ordeal several times a day. Yet the rodeo is presented to the American public as a harmless, red-blooded entertainment in which the cowboy – the epitome of wholesome, manly virtue – uses his courage and skill to overcome and subdue untamable, outlaw stock. Doubtless, the Romans employed similar fantasies to justify their activities in the [[Circus Maximus]].&lt;ref name="Serpell: 225"&gt;[[#Serpell|Serpell]]: 225&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Protests were first raised regarding animal welfare in the 1870s, and, beginning in the 1930s, some states enacted laws curtailing rodeo activities and other events involving animals.&lt;ref name="Westermeier: 436" /&gt;  In the 1950s, the then Rodeo Cowboys Association worked with the [[American Humane Association]] (AHA) to establish regulations protecting the welfare of rodeo animals that were acceptable to both organizations. These regulations appear in the PRCA's annually-updated rule book. Rodeo saw its greatest growth in the 1970s and with it a rise in animal cruelty complaints.&lt;ref name="Westermeier: 436" /&gt;  The PRCA and AHA have insinuated that these charges exist solely for the fund-raising purposes of other humane interest groups.  The protests and complaints have made the PRCA realize that public education regarding rodeo and the welfare of animals needs to be undertaken if rodeo is to survive.&lt;ref name="Westermeier: 436" /&gt;

In his "Author's Note" to ''Chasing the Rodeo'' (2005, 2006) author W.K. Stratton states, "Without question, rodeo exploits animals for the entertainment of humans, causing injury and death to hundreds of horses and cattle each year." Stratton notes that as many as a dozen head of steer and calves will die annually at a single large rodeo like the [[Calgary Stampede]], and that many valuable roping horses have died over the years at the [[Pendleton Roundup]] which is conducted on slippery grass. He also points out that while PETA ([[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]]) characterizes rodeo as "cruelty for a buck", conservative [[Matthew Scully]], a special assistant to and former speechwriter for President [[George W. Bush]] as well as author of ''[[Dominion: The Power of Man, the Suffering of Animals, and the Call to Mercy]]'' calls rodeo "gratuitous abuse of animals".  Stratton notes that he attended twenty plus rodeos and bullriding events in researching his book and saw "animals injured in the arena, some badly enough that they had to be destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stratton|Stratton]]: 300&amp;ndash;302&lt;/ref&gt;

==Independent assessments==
Modern rodeos in the United States are closely regulated and have responded to accusations of [[animal cruelty]] by instituting a number of rules to guide how rodeo animals are to be managed.&lt;ref name=PRCApdf&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080411122325/http://www.prorodeo.com/pdfs/AnimalWelfare.pdf ''Animal Welfare: The Care and Treatment of Professional Rodeo Livestock.'' PRCA {{dead link|date=May 2016}}] {{dead link|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, a survey of 28 sanctioned rodeos was conducted by on-site independent veterinarians.  Reviewing  animal runs, the injury rate was documented 0.047% (16 animals in 33,991 runs.&lt;ref name="Sellnow2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=3233|author=Sellnow, L.|date=January 1, 2002|title=Rodeo horses|publisher=The Horse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, a survey conducted by independent veterinarians at 57 PRCA rodeos found 0.053% (38 animal injuries in 71,743 animal exposures).&lt;ref name="Schonholtz2012"&gt;{{cite web|author=Schonholtz, C.|title=Professional rodeo horses are bred to buck |date=January 16, 2012|url=http://www.naiaonline.org/articles/article/professional-rodeo-horses-are-bred-to-buck#sthash.4WAHrlNx.dpbs|accessdate=May 28, 2012|publisher=National Animal Interest Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2001 survey reported an injury rate of 0.056% in 21 PRCA rodeos (15 animals in 26,584 performances).&lt;ref name="AVMA2001"&gt;{{cite journal|author=AVMA|title=Welfare of animals integral part of professional rodeos|date=January 15, 2001|publisher=American Veterinary Medical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A later PRCA survey of 60,971 animal performances at 198 rodeo performances and 73 sections of "slack" (competitions outside of the main competition events) indicated 27 animals were injured, i.e. 0.04%&lt;ref name="PRCApdf"/&gt;

In Australian rodeos, similar injury rates occur.  Basic injuries occur at a rate of 0.072% (one in 1,405), with injuries requiring veterinary attention at 0.036% (one injury each 2,810 times an animal is used in competition).&lt;ref name="Australian"&gt;{{cite web|title=Animals in rodeo|publisher=Australian Professional Rodeo Association|author=Welfare of animals integral part of professional rodeos|accessdate=May 28, 2016|url=http://www.prorodeo.com.au/files/uploaded/file/animalwelfare}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accusations of cruelty in US rodeos persist.   The PRCA acknowledges they sanction only about 30% of all rodeos, another 50% are sanctioned by other organizations and 20% are completely unsanctioned.&lt;ref name=PRCApdf/&gt; Several [[animal rights]] and animal welfare organizations keep records of accidents and incidents of possible animal abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharkonline.org/abuseinherent.mv SHARK] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110002548/http://www.sharkonline.org/abuseinherent.mv |date=2011-11-10 }}''Animal Abuse Inherent in Rodeo''.

Groups such as [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) note incidents of animal injury, including an incident where a "bull [sic] suffered from a broken neck ..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peta.org/issues/Animals-in-Entertainment/rodeo-cruelty-for-a-buck.aspx ''Rodeo: Cruelty for a Buck'']. Retrieved 23 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (ASPCA), practice sessions are often the scene of more severe animal welfare abuses than competitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pagename=pp_en_rodeo ASPCA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123072049/http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pagename=pp_en_rodeo |date=2008-11-23 }} "Animals in Entertainment: 5.4 Rodeo" 27 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toronto Medical Officer===
In 1990, when a major rodeo was planned for the [[Toronto]] [[Sky Dome]], [[Ontario, Canada]], the Toronto City Council requested the Toronto Medical Officer on Health to report on rodeo practices and whether "such practices could be deemed cruel to animals". The Medical Officer noted that animal handlers employed electric prods, flank straps, sharpened sticks, spurs and other tack were used to provoke animals into reacting in such a way as to make certain events thrilling for spectators, and thus it was unlikely to be enjoyable for livestock.&lt;ref name="Armstrong: 489"&gt;[[#Armstrong|Armstrong]]: 489&lt;/ref&gt;

The Medical Officer further noted that guidelines instituted to prevent animal abuse at sanctioned rodeos were paid little heed and calves suffered damage not readily visible such as bruised tracheal cartilage in roping events.  All bucking events were found by the Medical Officer to rely on the application of irritants to make the animals "fly" from the chutes.  The Medical Officer stated in his summary that in terms of a dictionary definition of cruelty, most rodeo events have the potential to cause injury, grief, or pain, and therefore can be considered cruel.  Although the Medical Officer did not say that the legal definition of cruelty had been met, he implied that it had been "reached, if not crossed."{{clarify|Is this a quote? If so, it is "stated, not implied"|date=May 2016}}&lt;ref name="Armstrong: 489"/&gt;

===Veterinarians===
E.J. Finocchio, DVM wrote the Rhode Island legislature urging a ban on calf roping: "As a large animal veterinarian for 20 years ... I have witnessed first hand the instant death of calves after their spinal cords were severed from the abrupt stop at the end of a rope when traveling up to 30 mph. I have also witnessed and tended calves who became paralyzed ... and whose tracheas were totally or partially severed ... Slamming to the ground has caused rupture of several internal organs leading to a slow, agonizing death for some of these calves."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Regan|Regan]]: 152&lt;/ref&gt;

C.J. Haber, a veterinarian with 30 years experience as a [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) meat inspector notes, "The rodeo folk send their animals to the packing house where ... I have seen cattle so extensively bruised that the only areas where the skin was attached [to the body] was the head, neck, legs, and belly. I have seen animals with six to eight ribs broken from the spine and at times puncturing the lungs."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Regan|Regan]]: 153&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positions of animal groups==
[[File:Calf Roping Rodeo.JPG|thumb|A steer after being roped.]]

===The Calgary Humane Society (CHS)===
"The Calgary Humane Society opposes the use of animals for any form of entertainment in which they are placed at risk of suffering undue stress, pain, injury or death."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Statement|CHS]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Given its position on animals in entertainment, CHS opposes rodeo events like chuckwagon racing, calf-roping and steer wrestling that are the most often implicated in injury to animals.

While other organizations may wish to intervene through protest, or other means, CHS has found it can best protect the interests of the animals involved by working with organizations that put on such events.  Over more than a decade of work with the Calgary Stampede, Calgary Humane Society has been instrumental in significant changes that have reduced injuries (for example, changes to the chuckwagon track that reduced stress fractures to the legs of horses; penalizing of calf-roping that yanked the calf backward) and eliminated certain high risk events (like wild cow milking).

CHS does its work by providing recommendations to the organizations, by following up on public complaints, and by having its Peace Officers attending these events to ensure the province's Animal Protection Act (APA) is upheld.

Under Alberta and Canadian law, Calgary Humane Society's primary role in attendance of the Calgary Stampede is to enforce the Animal Protection Act of Alberta.Calgary Humane Society Peace Officers attend every day of the Stampede to monitor and ensure the animals are being properly treated i.e., food, water, shelter and care. They are also immediately on scene of any accident involving an animal  to ensure the animal is being treated promptly, efficiently and humanely, to document what happened, and to follow up with the unresolved cases.

CHS encourages concerned citizens to document their complaints and send them to the agencies and individuals listed in the attached document.

===The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS)===
[[The Humane Society of the United States]] (HSUS) takes a position of opposition to all rodeos and rodeo events:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The HSUS opposes rodeos as they are commonly organized, since they typically cause torment and stress to animals; expose them to pain, injury, or even death; and encourage an insensitivity to and acceptance of the inhumane treatment of animals in the name of sport. Accordingly, we oppose the use of devices such as electric prods, sharpened sticks, spurs, flank straps, and other rodeo equipment that cause animals to react violently, and we oppose bull riding, bronco riding, steer roping, calf roping, "wild horse racing," chuck wagon racing, steer tailing, and horse tripping.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Statement|HSUS]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Humane Society of the United States came into being in 1954 as an offshoot of the American Humane Association (AHA), and initially tackled legislation regarding humane slaughter, the protection of laboratory animals and other issues. In the 1970s, the organization began eyeing rodeo and its "psychologically damaging" effect on children.

===The Vancouver Humane Society===
"Vancouver Humane Society is opposed to rodeo because most rodeo events involve the use of fear, stress or pain to make animals perform."  In Canada, the City of Vancouver and the District of North Vancouver have banned rodeos. For the most part, all animal welfare organizations in Canada oppose rodeo, including the Humane Society of Canada and the Canadian Federation of Humane Societies.&lt;ref name="VHS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vancouverhumanesociety.bc.ca/issues/animals_in_entertainment/rodeo |title=Rodeo: animal abuse for the sake of entertainment |work=Vancouver Humane Society|accessdate=April 1, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090318120749/http://www.vancouverhumanesociety.bc.ca/issues/animals_in_entertainment/rodeo| archivedate= 18 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HSC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.humanesociety.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=277&amp;Itemid=169 |title=Rodeos A Brutal Violent Spectacle Says The HSC |work=The Humane Society of Canada|accessdate=April 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA)===
PETA criticizes the United States military in its annual expenditure of tax dollars to support the [[Professional Bull Riders]] (PBR), stating that American tax dollars are fueling "horrific and cruel rodeo events".  PETA asserts that rodeo animals suffer fear and pain through the application of spurs, flank straps, prods, and tail-twisting.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Aguilar|Aguilar]]: 157&lt;/ref&gt;

PETA has used some unorthodox methods to make its point. Moments after being crowned, [[Miss Rodeo America]] 2000 had a chocolate [[tofu]] 'cow pie' pushed in her face by a PETA member. PETA President, [[Ingrid Newkirk]], said in a statement that Miss Rodeo America should relinquish her crown for promoting cruelty to animals. "Now that she's got pie on her face, we hope Miss Rodeo America will find a little compassion in her heart," Newkirk said. The pageant is held in conjunction with the [[National Finals Rodeo]], an event PETA annually protests against, claiming the sport exploits animals.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Associated Press|AP]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA)===
The [[ASPCA]] has a policy statement on rodeo events that reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ASPCA is opposed to all rodeo events that involve cruel, painful, stressful and potentially harmful treatment of livestock, not only in performance but also in handling, transport and prodding to perform. The ASPCA recognizes the cruel treatment inflicted on many additional animals in the process of practicing to compete in rodeo events. Further, the ASPCA is opposed to children's rodeo events such as goat tying, calf riding and sheep riding ("mutton busting"), which do not promote humane care and respect for animals.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ASPCA|ASPCA]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The American Humane Association (AHA)===
The [[American Humane Association]] (AHA) used to campaign against rodeo through anti-rodeo literature but changed its strategy in the 1950s and began working with rodeo to establish rules to ensure the humane treatment of livestock.  The rules are updated as needed and published annually in the PRCA's rule book.  The AHA believes the exploitation of animals begins when "animals, people, and money" are mixed together, and what progress has been made is ascribed to a change in people's attitudes in general and the urban and college background of modern rodeo participants. Moral philosopher [[Peter Singer]] has criticized the AHA for collaborating with rodeo and thereby lending respectability to its cruelties.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fredricksson|Fredricksson]]: 169&lt;/ref&gt;  The AHA has strict requirements for the treatment and use of animals in movie rodeo scenes. The use of electric prods and other artificial stimuli to make an animal perform are forbidden, for example.&lt;ref&gt;[[#American Humane Association|AHA]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Australia (RSPCA Australia)===
The [[RSPCA Australia]] is opposed to rodeo. It has repeatedly called for rodeo to be banned,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rspcavic.org/campaigns_news/images/Media%20Releases/2008_03_Rodeo%20Ban.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,21424365-2862,00.html | work=Herald Sun | title=RSPCA backs rodeo ban | first=Ian | last=Royall | date=2007-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2009/01/08/48651_tasmania-news.html RSPCA moves on rodeos Tasmania News - The Mercury - The Voice of Tasmania&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  and has funded media campaigns urging public boycott of prominent international rodeos.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rspcavic.org/campaigns_news/images/Media%20Releases/2008_04_stamp_out_rodeos.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Its policy statement reads:

Compliance with national standards for the management, housing and transport of rodeo animals must be made a condition of licensing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kb.rspca.org.au/RSPCA-Policy-C07-Rodeos_178.html RSPCA Policy C07 Rodeos], ''RSPCA Australia'', accessed February 15, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Responses==

===Rodeo===
The PRCA admits it only oversees about a third of the actual rodeos that occur in the United States annually, and, according to their own public relations information, the organization has taken steps to improve the welfare of animals. The organization says that most rodeo animals enjoy what they're doing.&lt;ref&gt;name="Serpell: 225"&lt;/ref&gt;  The PRCA's regulations and rules require, among other things, provisions for injured animals, [[veterinarian]]s on site at PRCA sanctioned rodeos, and [[spur]]s with dulled, free-spinning rowels.  Health regulations mandate vaccinations and blood testing of animals crossing state lines, and sick or injured animals are given appropriate veterinary care.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association|PRCA]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article published by the [[American Veterinary Medical Association]] (AVMA) in its Journal dated January 2001, Dr. James Furman, a former rodeo rider and mixed practice practitioner, stated at the organization's Animal Welfare Forum that ranchers provide their stock health and other care. When grilled about the possible damage to a calf's neck when he is roped and jerked to a sudden stop, Dr. Furman responded by observing that rodeo men have changed calf roping techniques; where they once roped and flipped a calf on its back they now try to spin the standing calf around.

''[[Charreada]]'' is amateur rodeo among Mexican Americans in the United States with family-owned arenas being operated for 200 teams in 12 states.  Eight states have cracked down on several traditional events including horse-tripping, an event in which the front legs of a running mare are roped causing her to fall, and steer tailing in which a steer is flipped to the earth by grabbing his tail. Some Mexican Americans have expressed concerns their culture is being unfairly targeted and point to the deaths of [[Eight Belles]] and other race horses as evidence that Anglo sports involving animals see few restrictions.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;

Rodeo sometimes appears in court. A PRCA [[stock contractor]] faced animal cruelty charges regarding the use of a prod at a California rodeo in 2002. Testimony revealed a rodeo judge and a veterinarian had been consulted before the rodeo about a chute-stalling horse, and an agreement had been reached that if the horse stalled, the prod would be applied to protect all involved. California law stipulates a prod cannot be used on an animal in a holding chute unless necessary to protect participants and spectators.  The stock contractor was cleared of charges because the chute gate was open when the prod was used, and therefore it was not a holding chute.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Schonholtz|Schonholtz]]: Animal&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government===
In response to animal welfare and animal cruelty concerns, a number of laws have passed regulating rodeo. In the United Kingdom the [[Protection of Animals Act 1934]] effectively made rodeo, as it was then practiced, illegal in England, Scotland and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Garner Robert (1993) ''Animals, Politics and Morality'' Manchester, UK, Manchester University Press, p.88, {{ISBN|0-7190-3574-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2000, California became the first American state to prohibit the use of prods on any animal in a chute.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Curnutt|Curnutt]]: 268&lt;/ref&gt;

Stringent regulations have virtually eliminated rodeo in [[Rhode Island]], a state which also stipulates that any individual convicted of animal cruelty in a rodeo cannot participate as a rodeo contestant.  While there is no record in any state of anyone being convicted of cruelty to animals during the course of a rodeo, several states&amp;mdash;[[Arizona]], [[Colorado]], [[Kansas]], [[Missouri]], [[Montana]], [[Nebraska]], [[New Mexico]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Oregon]], [[Utah]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and [[Wyoming]]&amp;mdash;all exempt rodeo from its anticruelty laws, making such convictions impossible. Eleven of the states immunize rodeo events from the provisions of the law, while Utah excludes rodeo animals from the definition of 'animal' in its anitcruelty laws. [[Idaho]] has declared exhibitions that are commonly considered acceptable cannot be charged with cruelty to animals.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Curnett|Curnett]]: 272&lt;/ref&gt;

After a video aired on [[NBC]] showing a bull breaking its leg in a 1991 [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] rodeo, the city banned controversial rodeo tack, specifically electric prods or shocking devices, flank or bucking straps, wire tie-downs, and sharpened or fixed spurs or rowels.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Curnutt|Curnutt]] 272&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#People for the Ethical Treatment of AnimalsETA|PETA]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Pittsburgh also requires humane officers be provided access to any and all areas where animals may go&amp;ndash;specifically pens, chutes, and injury pens.&lt;ref&gt;[[#People for teh Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fort Wayne, Indiana]] does not allow anyone to conduct a rodeo within the city limits.&lt;ref&gt;[[#PETA|PETA]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, [[Woodstock, Illinois]] made fighting or wrestling with any animal illegal, thus ending [[steer wrestling]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Curnutt|Curnutt]]: 273&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ohio]] has restricted some rodeo practices, having outlawed unpadded flank and bucking straps and the use of electric prods on cattle and horses.    Rodeo was banned in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1934 when Parliament passed the Protection of Animals Act. [[Baltimore, Maryland]], [[Southampton (town), New York|Southampton, New York]], and [[Pompano Beach, Florida]] have enacted legislation banning certain rodeo tack including [[bullwhip]]s.  [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] has banned rodeo within the city limits&amp;mdash;the only complete ban on rodeo in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Curnutt|Curnutt]]: 272&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ballerina skirt''' is a full [[skirt]] that reaches to mid-calf or just above the [[ankle]]s, worn as a costume in a ballet performance. It is often made up of multiple layers of fabric.&lt;ref&gt;Valerie Cumming, C. W. Cunnington, P. E. Cunnington, ''The Dictionary of Fashion History'', Berg, 2010, p 11&lt;/ref&gt; It was a popular casual skirt style during the 1950s.

Ballerina skirts have been a consistently popular length for formal dresses, especially for young [[women]].The most persistent image of a ballerina skirt is that worn by the most famous ballerina [[Anna Pavlova]]. Early ballerina skirts were heavy, bulky and unwieldy, severely restricting the dancer's movements. By the early twentieth century, skirts were raised to the knees to showcase pointe work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Encyclopedia of clothing and fashion|url=http://angelasancartier.net/ballet-costume|website=Encyclopedia of clothing and fashion RSS|accessdate=July 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ballerina skirt is typically made up of five to 12 layers of tulle fabric. A ballerina skirt typically allows the wearer to seem more beautiful, feminine and elegant, as well as being associated with the traditional costume for  classical ballet performances.

Different types of the ballerina skirts are used in ballet performance including the romantic, classic, pancake, balanchine and platter skirts.

The '''Beach Volleyball Database''' is an online [[website]] that holds extensive information about international [[beach volleyball]] players, tournaments and history. News are frequently updated, and the site has results for [[continent]]al and [[international]] tournaments. It is the only website of its kind in the sport of beach volleyball.

The press operations officer for the [[Association of Volleyball Professionals|AVP]], Tim Simmons, has said that the Beach Volleyball Database has had a major impact on the sport. Information that is now easily accessible through the website, used to take time consuming research through different sources. Now professional athletes have a chance to set long-term goals based on their long-term results in comparison to other professional beach volleyball players.&lt;ref name=keck&gt;Alan Keck, [http://www.bvbinfo.com/news.asp?ID=399 Beach Volleyball: Fan is a one-man, on-line encyclopedia on the sport], [[The Virginian Pilot]], 2002 (Beach Volleyball Database)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''blue''' is an award earned by athletes at a university and some schools for competition at the highest level. The awarding of blues began at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] universities in England. It is awarded at [[United Kingdom|British]], and some [[Canada|Canadian]], [[Australia]]n and [[New Zealand]] universities.

==History==
The first sporting contest between the universities of Oxford and Cambridge was held on 4 June 1827, when a two-day [[cricket]] match at [[Lord's]], organized by Charles Wordsworth, nephew of the poet [[William Wordsworth|William]], resulted in a draw. There is no record of any university "colours" being worn during the game.&lt;ref name=cam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport.cam.ac.uk/documents/en/his/history.pdf |title=Blues and the Blues Committee: Some historical notes |publisher=Cambridge University Blues Committee |author=Christopher Thorne |date=10 July 1996 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716024827/http://www.sport.cam.ac.uk/documents/en/his/history.pdf |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/0/440.html|title=Oxford University v Cambridge University, University Match 1827|publisher=cricketarchive.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020114333/http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/0/440.html|archivedate=20 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the first [[The Boat Race|Boat Race]] in 1829, the Oxford crew was dominated by students of [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], whose college colours were dark blue. They wore white shirts with dark blue stripes, while Cambridge wore white with a pink or scarlet sash. At the second race, in 1836, a light blue ribbon was attached to the front of the Cambridge boat, probably as it was the colour of [[Eton College|Eton]]. These colours — light blue for Cambridge, and dark blue for Oxford — became the official colours of the two boat clubs, and through the rivalry of the Boat Race, the colours became inextricably linked with the universities and contests between the two.&lt;ref name=cam/&gt;&lt;ref name=oxf&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vincents.org/history/theoxfordblue/ |title=The Oxford Blue |author=[[Norris McWhirter]] |publisher=Vincent's Club |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530175302/http://www.vincents.org/history/theoxfordblue/ |archivedate=30 May 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Athletes at the [[University of Cambridge]] may be awarded a '''full blue''' (or simply a '''blue'''), '''half blue''', '''first team colours''' or '''second team colours''' for competing at the highest level of university sport, which must include being in a varsity match or race against the [[University of Oxford]]. A full blue is the highest honour that may be bestowed on a Cambridge athlete, and is a much-coveted and prestigious prize. In general, the full blue standard is approximately that of being successful at a national level of student competition, and the half blue standard is that of being successful at county or regional level.

=== History ===
Once light blue had been chosen as the colour of Cambridge's Boat Club, the other university sport clubs followed suit, though out of courtesy would request permission from the Boat Club before awarding such a "blue". In the 1860s the three senior sports — rowing, cricket and athletics — were awarding blues, and the presidents of each formed an informal "Blues Committee" to oversee such awards. By 1880 a number of smaller clubs involved in [[varsity match]]es had successfully requested the right to award "half blues".&lt;ref name=cam/&gt;

=== Awarding process ===
The criteria for awarding blues are different for men and women. Awards are made at the discretion of the men's and women's Blues Committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sport.cam.ac.uk/committees/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060110021421/http://www.sport.cam.ac.uk/committees/index.html |archivedate=10 January 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Men's Blues Committee is formed from one representative of each of the full blue sports, and the Women's from one representative of each of the full blue and half blue sports. Each committee meets to discuss issues relating to Cambridge sport.

In some sports with full blue status, the varsity match second team is awarded '''second team colours'''.

The awarding of a full blue often requires a person to fulfill a number of requirements in the same academic year, particularly in sports with discretionary full blue status. If, for whatever reason, an exceptional athlete is of or above full blue standard but does not fulfill all the requirements for the 'automatic' award of a full blue in any given year, the committee has the authority to grant an '''extraordinary full blue''' to that person subject to scrutiny of the particular case. The individual's case must be presented to the Blues Committee in person and must be backed up by substantial evidence and references. The award is unlikely to be made unless the person is of world-class or at least international standard.

Each sport has specific criteria for each award; the general categorisation of men's and women's sports is laid out below, though the status of each sport is subject to frequent review.

=== Regalia ===
[[Image:Cambridge-half-blue-blazer.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] Half Blue blazer and bow tie.]]

The winner of a blue or half blue is entitled to wear a blues blazer, which is one of the most recognisable and distinctive garments associated with Cambridge University. Full blue blazers are completely coloured [[Cambridge Blue (colour)|Cambridge Blue]]. Half blue blazers have a number of different designs, depending on the wearer's sport; a typical design is an off-white blazer with Cambridge blue lapels and trimmings. There is a variety of other blue and half blue paraphernalia, including scarves, ties, pullovers, bow ties, caps and squares.  Such items are worn with pride.

{{As of|2011|5}}, the colour recognised officially by the University as Cambridge Blue actually has a slight green tint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cam.ac.uk/system/files/identity_guidelines.pdf |title=Identity guidelines - fifth edition |date=25 March 2012 |publisher=University of Cambridge |accessdate=3 May 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220071050/https://www.cam.ac.uk/system/files/identity_guidelines.pdf |archivedate=20 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 in Cambridge an alumna launched Oxbridge Blues Jewellery &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxbridgebluesjewellery.com/cambridge/|title=Cambridge Blue &amp; Half Blue - Oxbridge Blues Jewellery|website=www.oxbridgebluesjewellery.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924062824/http://www.oxbridgebluesjewellery.com/cambridge/|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically for women's blues and half blues at the two Universities. These are the only blues item to have been licensed by the University of Cambridge.

=== Hawks' Club/Ospreys ===
Men holding blues, half blues or second team colours in a Full blue sport are eligible to join the [[Hawks' Club]]. Women holding any of these awards are eligible to join The Ospreys, which was founded in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sport.cam.ac.uk/ospreys/about.html |title=About the Ospreys |publisher=Cambridge University Women's Sports Club |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828063601/http://www.sport.cam.ac.uk/ospreys/about.html |archivedate=28 August 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== University of Oxford ==
{{Redirect|Oxford Blue|the colour|Oxford Blue (colour)|the cheese variety|Oxford Blue (cheese)}}

===Administration===
At the [[University of Oxford]], the committees for awarding blues and half blues work on much the same principles as the Cambridge committees. The principal difference between the two men's committees is that, at Oxford, all Captains, regardless of their status as full, discretionary, or half blue must attend meetings of the Committee. Until recently, the voting was broken up according to blues status with full blue captains being allowed to vote on all matters while all the other captains could only vote on matters directly relating to half blue sports. In Michaelmas Term 2006, the committee finally allowed discretionary full blue captains the right to vote on matters directly relating to discretionary full blue sports. This has ended many years of inequality for discretionary full blue status captains and was largely welcomed by the committee.

The committees are administered by an elected president, secretary and treasurer who serve one year. Unlike at Cambridge, where the president of Cambridge University Boat Club holds the position, at Oxford, any captain can be elected president, regardless of sport or status.

The role of the president is to call and serve as chair of any meeting of the committee, of which there are normally 3 per year (6 for the women).  They also serve as the representative of the committee and sit on the University Sports Strategy Committee and the Executive Committee of the Sports Federation.  Both Presidents along with the Director of Sport represent Oxford at any meetings of a Joint Blues Committee held with Cambridge.  The purpose of the Joint Blues Committee is to discuss issues of eligibility for the varsity match and to settle any disputes between the sporting communities of the two universities.

[[Image:Oxford-half-blue-blazer.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] Rifle Club half blue blazer and tie]]

===Costume===
The colour of an Oxford full blue blazer is dark blue. The Oxford half blue blazer can be one of two designs. Either it is composed of thick vertical stripes of dark blue and off-white, as in the adjacent image, or it can be dark blue, as the full blue blazer, with two white stripes above the club badge on the left breast.

The Oxford range of Oxbridge Blues Jewellery&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxbridgebluesjewellery.com/oxford/|title=Oxford Blue and Half Blue - Oxbridge Blues Jewellery|website=www.oxbridgebluesjewellery.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924062825/http://www.oxbridgebluesjewellery.com/oxford/|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; was launched in Oxford at the Women's Blues Award Ceremony in the Natural History Museum in 2012. The range is the same as the Cambridge design except that the semi-precious stones are navy blue and white.

===Clubs===
The club associated with the Oxford blue is [[Vincent’s Club]], although its membership is not restricted to blues, and there are wider criteria for election. ''[[Atalantas]]'' is a club for sportswomen at Oxford, and also is not restricted to blues.

== 'Blues' in Australia ==

=== University of Adelaide ===
The [[Sport at the University of Adelaide|Adelaide University Sports Association]] at the [[University of Adelaide]] in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]] awards a blue and a half blue for outstanding sporting achievement, and a club letters for both sporting achievement and service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AWARDS |url=http://unione.theblacks.com.au/Common/ContentWM.aspx?CID=13 |publisher=The Adelaide University Sports Association |accessdate=10 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409084809/http://unione.theblacks.com.au/Common/ContentWM.aspx?CID=13 |archivedate=9 April 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== La Trobe University ===
[[La Trobe University]] has awarded blues and half blues since its early years, with the first blues being awarded in 1968. The annual Blues and Sports Awards Night recognises the elite sports men and women who have represented La Trobe via the university's clubs, intervarsity sporting competitions and the World University games.  There are also awards for Outstanding Service which recognise the outstanding service to sports clubs by members of the La Trobe Community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latrobe.edu.au/unisport/clubs/honour-board|title=Life Members and Honour Board|last=University|first=La Trobe|website=www.latrobe.edu.au|access-date=2016-04-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422001250/http://www.latrobe.edu.au/unisport/clubs/honour-board|archivedate=22 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== University of Melbourne ===
The Melbourne University Sports Association (originally known as the 'Sports Union') awards blues and half blues at the [[University of Melbourne]], for outstanding performance in inter-university events (primarily through the [[Australian University Games]] and Australian University Championships). A 'distinguished service award' may be made (including to non-students) for outstanding service to a sporting club (or clubs), the Sports Association, and/or sport at the university generally.

Blues were first awarded in 1904, as one of the first items of business of the newly formed Sports Union, with retrospective awards made back as early as 1870. Initially, awards were made automatically to all participants in an intervarsity contest, with the level (full or half blue) dependant on the sport. In 1911, this model was replaced with the formation of a 'Blues Advisory Board' to determine the awards based on an individual's performance. The BAB continues to serve this role today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Senyard | first = June E. | year = 2004 | title = The Ties That Bind: A History of Sport at the University of Melbourne | publisher = Walla Walla Press | location = Petersham, NSW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== University of Queensland ===
Blues and half-blues have been awarded at the University of Queensland since 1912. Blues have been awarded for outstanding performances in club fixtures, representative games, and inter-university competitions as well as for international representation whilst studying at the University. The University of Queensland blue is the highest sporting accolade an athlete can receive from the university. In recent years, UQ Sport through its Blues Advisory Committee, has developed a selection method and criteria to ensure that blues and half blues at the university are of the highest standard. Each year these awards are presented at the UQ Sport Blues Awards Dinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uqsport.com.au/content/uq-blues-awards|title=UQ BLUES AWARDS|publisher=University of Queensland|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022192217/http://www.uqsport.com.au/content/uq-blues-awards|archivedate=22 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 'Blues' in New Zealand ==
Since 1919 the New Zealand Universities Blue has been awarded to [[NZ University]] students who have achieved excellence both on and off the field of play. Currently [[University Sport New Zealand]] is responsible for presenting this award&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universitysport.org.nz/nzu-blues|title=NZU Blues - Student Life &amp; Sport|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528015531/http://www.universitysport.org.nz/nzu-blues|archivedate=28 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, individual universities will award their own blues. For example, [[University of Otago]] blues date from 1907,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ousa.org.nz/recreation/blues-and-golds-awards/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522130102/http://www.ousa.org.nz/recreation/blues-and-golds-awards/ |archivedate=22 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore pre-dating the New Zealand Universities blue.

[[File:Bouncing_ball_strobe_edit.jpg|thumb|250px|A bouncing ball. The motion is not quite [[parabola|parabolic]] due to [[air resistance]].]]

The '''physics of a bouncing ball''' concerns the physical behaviour of [[deflection (physics)|bouncing]] [[ball]]s, particularly its [[motion (physics)|motion]] before, during, and after [[impact (mechanics)|impact]] against the surface of another [[body (physics)|body]]. Several aspects of a bouncing ball's behaviour serve as an introduction to [[mechanics]] in [[high school]] or [[undergraduate]] level physics courses. However, the exact modelling of the behaviour is complex and of interest in [[sports engineering]].

The motion of a ball is generally described by [[projectile motion]] (which can be affected by [[gravity]], [[drag (physics)|drag]], the [[Magnus effect]], and [[buoyancy]]), while its impact is usually characterized through the [[coefficient of restitution]] (which can be affected by the nature of the ball, the nature of the impacting surface, the impact velocity, rotation, and local conditions such as [[temperature]] and [[pressure]]). To ensure [[sportsmanship|fair play]], many [[sports governing body|sports governing bodies]] set limits on the bounciness of their ball and forbid tampering with the ball's aerodynamic properties. The bounciness of balls has been a feature of sports as ancient as the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]].&lt;ref name=Whittington2001/&gt;

[[File:Ball forces during flight.svg|thumb|250px|The forces acting on a spinning ball during its flight are the [[gravitational force]] ('''F'''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;), the [[drag (physics)|drag force]] ('''F'''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;), the [[Magnus force]] ('''F'''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;), and the [[buoyant force]] ('''F'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;).]]

The motion of a bouncing ball obeys [[projectile motion]].&lt;ref name=Brancazio1985/&gt;&lt;ref name=Walker2014/&gt; Many forces act on a real ball, namely the [[gravitational force]] ('''F'''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;), the [[drag (physics)|drag force]] due to [[air resistance]] ('''F'''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;), the [[Magnus force]] due to the ball's [[rotation|spin]] ('''F'''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;), and the [[buoyant force]] ('''F'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;). In general, one has to use [[Newton's second law]] taking all forces into account to analyze the ball's motion:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sum \mathbf{F} &amp; = m\mathbf{a}, \\
\mathbf{F}_\text{G} + \mathbf{F}_\text{D} + \mathbf{F}_\text{M} + \mathbf{F}_\text{B} &amp; = m \mathbf{a} = m \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} = m\frac{d^2\mathbf{r}}{dt^2},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''m'' is the ball's mass. Here, '''a''', '''v''', '''r''' represent the ball's [[acceleration]], [[velocity]], and [[position (vector)|position]] over [[time]] ''t''.

===Gravity===
{{Main|Gravity}}
[[File:Inclinedthrow.gif|thumb|250px|Trajectory of a ball bouncing at an angle of 70° after impact without {{nowrap|[[Drag (physics)|drag]] {{color box|black}}}}, with {{nowrap|[[Stokes' law|Stokes drag]] {{color box|blue}}}}, and with {{nowrap|[[Newtonian fluid|Newton drag]] {{color box|green}}}}.]]

The gravitational force is directed downwards and is equal to&lt;ref name=Bush2013/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_\text{G} = mg,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''m'' is the mass of the ball, and ''g'' is the [[gravitational acceleration]], which on [[Earth]] varies between {{val|9.764|ul=m/s2}} and {{val|9.834|u=m/s2}}.&lt;ref name=Hirt2013/&gt; Because the other forces are usually small, the motion is often [[idealized]] as being only under the influence of gravity. If only the force of gravity acts on the ball, the [[mechanical energy]] will be [[conservation of energy|conserved]] during its flight. In this idealized case, the equations of motion are given by
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf{a} &amp; = -g \mathbf{\hat{j}}, \\
\mathbf{v} &amp; = \mathbf{v}_\text{0} + \mathbf{a}t, \\
\mathbf{r} &amp; = \mathbf{r}_0 + \mathbf{v}_0 t + \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{a}t^2,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where '''a''', '''v''', and '''r''' denote the acceleration, velocity, and position of the ball, and '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are the initial velocity and position of the ball, respectively.

More specifically, if the ball is bounced at an angle ''&amp;theta;'' with the ground, the motion in the ''x''- and ''y''-axes (representing ''horizontal'' and ''vertical'' motion, respectively) is described by&lt;ref name=HyperPhysicsTrajectories/&gt;
{{columns|
|col1=
;''x''-axis
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
a_\text{x} &amp; = 0, \\
v_\text{x} &amp; = v_0 \cos \left(\theta \right), \\
x &amp; = x_0 + v_0 \cos \left( \theta \right) t,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
|col2=
;''y''-axis
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
a_\text{y} &amp; = -g, \\
v_\text{y} &amp; = v_0 \sin \left(\theta \right) -gt, \\
y &amp; = y_0 + v_0 \sin \left( \theta \right) t -\frac{1}{2}gt^2.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
}}

The equations imply that the maximum height (''H'') and [[range of a projectile|range]] (''R'') and [[time of flight]] (''T'') of a ball bouncing on a flat surface are given by&lt;ref name=Brancazio1985/&gt;&lt;ref name=HyperPhysicsTrajectories/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
H &amp; = \frac{v_0^2}{2g}\sin^2\left(\theta\right), \\
R &amp;= \frac{v_0^2}{g}\sin\left(2\theta\right),~\text{and} \\
T &amp;= \frac{2v_0}{g} \sin \left(\theta \right).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Trajectory of a projectile#Trajectory of a projectile with air resistance|Further refinements]] to the motion of the ball can be made by taking into account [[air resistance]] (and related effects such as [[drag (physics)|drag]] and [[wind]]), the [[Magnus effect]], and [[buoyancy]]. Because lighter balls accelerate more readily, their motion tends to be affected more by such forces.

===Drag===
{{Main|Drag (physics)}}
Air flow around the ball can be either [[laminar flow|laminar]] or [[turbulent flow|turbulent]] depending on the [[Reynolds number]] (Re), defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Re} = \frac{\rho D v}{\mu},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''&amp;rho;'' is the [[density of air]], ''&amp;mu;'' the [[dynamic viscosity]] of air, ''D'' the diameter of the ball, and ''v'' the velocity of the ball through air. At a [[temperature]] of {{val|20|u=degC}}, {{nowrap|1=''&amp;rho;'' = {{val|1.2|u=kg/m3}}}} and {{nowrap|1=''&amp;mu;'' = {{val|1.8|e=-5|u=Pa·s}}}}.&lt;ref name=EngineeringToolbox/&gt;

If the Reynolds number is very low (Re&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1), the drag force on the ball is described by [[Stokes' law]]:&lt;ref name=Southard2006/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_\text{D} = 6 \pi \mu r v,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''r'' is the radius of the ball. This force acts in opposition to the ball's direction (in the direction of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle -\hat \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;). For most sports balls, however, the Reynolds number will be between 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; and Stokes' law does not apply.&lt;ref name=Metha2008/&gt; At these higher values of the Reynolds number, the drag force on the ball is instead described by the [[drag equation]]:&lt;ref name=NASADragSphere/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_\text{D} = \frac{1}{2} \rho C_\text{d} A v^2,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''C''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[drag coefficient]], and ''A'' the [[cross section (geometry)|cross-sectional area]] of the ball.

Drag will cause the ball to lose mechanical energy during its flight, and will reduce the range and the height of a ball, while [[crosswind]]s will deflect it from its original path. Both effects have to be taken into account by players in sports such as golf.

===Magnus effect===
{{Main|Magnus effect}}
[[File:Sketch of Magnus effect with streamlines and turbulent wake.svg|thumb|250px|The Magnus force acting on a ball with [[backspin]]. The curly flow lines represent a [[turbulence|turbulent]] [[wake]]. The airflow has been deflected in the direction of spin.]]

 | footer = In [[table tennis]], a skilled player can exploit the ball's spin to affect the trajectory of the ball [[#Magnus effect|during its flight]] and its [[#spin and angle of impact|reaction upon impact]] with a surface. With [[topspin]], the ball reaches maximum height further into its flight (1) and then curves abruptly downwards (2). The impact propels the ball forward (3) and will tend to bounce upwards when impacting the opposing player's [[paddle]]. The situation is opposite in the case of [[backspin]].
}}
The [[rotation|spin]] of the ball will affect its trajectory through the [[Magnus effect]]. According to the [[Kutta–Joukowski theorem]] for a spinning sphere with an [[inviscid flow]] of air, the Magnus force is equal to&lt;ref name=NASAIdealLift/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_\text{M} = \frac{8}{3} \pi r^3 \rho \omega v,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''r'' is the radius of the ball, ''&amp;omega;'' the [[angular velocity]] (or spin rate) of the ball, ''&amp;rho;'' the density of air, and ''v'' the velocity of the ball relative to air. This force is directed perpendicular to the motion and perpendicular to the axis of rotation (in the direction of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \hat \mathbf{\omega} \times \hat \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;). The force is directed upwards for backspin and downwards for topspin. In reality, flow is never inviscid, and the Magnus lift is better described by&lt;ref name=Nathan2008/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_\text{M}=\frac{1}{2}\rho C_\text{L} A v^2,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''&amp;rho;'' is the density of air, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; the [[lift coefficient]], ''A'' the cross-sectional area of the ball, and ''v'' the velocity of the ball relative to air. The lift coefficient is a complex factor which depends amongst other things on the ratio ''r&amp;omega;''/''v'', the Reynolds number, and [[surface roughness]].&lt;ref name=Nathan2008/&gt; In certain conditions&lt;!--requires a smooth ball, according to a conversation with Rod Cross, will look for sources--&gt;, the lift coefficient can even be negative, changing the direction of the Magnus force ([[reverse Magnus effect]]).&lt;ref name=Bush2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kim2011/&gt;

In sports like [[tennis]] or [[volleyball]], the player can use the Magnus effect to control the ball's trajectory (e.g. via [[topspin]] or [[backspin]]) during flight. In [[golf]], the effect is responsible for [[Golf stroke mechanics#Misplayed shots|slicing and hooking]] which are usually a detriment to the golfer, but also helps with increasing the range of a [[drive (golf)|drive]] and other shots.&lt;ref name=HumanKinetics/&gt;&lt;ref name=DeForest1997/&gt; In [[baseball]], [[pitcher]]s use the effect to create [[curveball]]s and other special [[Pitch (baseball)|pitch]]es.&lt;ref name=Clanet2015/&gt;

[[Ball tampering]] is often illegal, and is often at the centre of [[cricket]] controversies such as the one between [[ball tampering controversy in August 2006|England and Pakistan in August 2006]].&lt;ref name=GuardianInzamam/&gt; In baseball, the term '[[spitball]]' refers to the illegal coating of the ball with spit or other substances to alter the [[aerodynamics]] of the ball.&lt;ref name=Okrent1989/&gt;

===Buoyancy===
{{Main|Buoyancy}}
Any object immersed in a [[fluid]] such as water or air will experience an upwards [[buoyancy]].&lt;ref name=Post2010/&gt; According to [[Archimedes' principle]], this buoyant force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. In the case of a sphere, this force is equal to
:&lt;math&gt;F_\text{B} = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \rho g.&lt;/math&gt;

The buoyant force is usually small compared to the drag and Magnus forces and can often be neglected. However, in the case of a basketball, the buoyant force can amount to about 1.5% of the ball's weight.&lt;ref name=Post2010/&gt; Since buoyancy is directed upwards, it will act to increase the range and height of the ball.

==Impact==
[[File:Bouncing ball compression and decompression.svg|thumb|250px|The compression (A→B) and decompression (B→C) of a ball impacting against a surface. The force of impact is usually proportional to the compression distance, at least for small compressions, and can be modelled as a [[spring force]].&lt;ref name=Cross1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=Georgallas2016/&gt;]]

When a ball [[impact (mechanics)|impacts]] a surface, the surface [[recoil]]s and [[vibration|vibrates]], as does the ball, creating both [[sound]] and [[heat]], and the ball loses [[kinetic energy]]. Additionally, the impact can impart some rotation to the ball, transferring some of its [[translational kinetic energy]] into [[rotational energy|rotational kinetic energy]]. This energy loss is usually characterized (indirectly) through the [[coefficient of restitution]] (or COR, denoted ''e''):&lt;ref name=RacquetResearch/&gt;&lt;ref name="v-sign" group="note"&gt;Here, ''v'' and ''u'' are not just the [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of velocities, but include also their direction ([[sign (mathematics)|sign]]).&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;e = -\frac{v_\text{f} - u_\text{f}}{v_\text{i} - u_\text{i}},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''v''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; and ''v''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are the final and initial velocities of the ball, and ''u''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; and ''u''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are the final and initial velocities impacting surface, respectively. In the specific case where a ball impacts on an immovable surface, the COR simplifies to
:&lt;math&gt;e = -\frac{v_\text{f}}{v_\text{i}}.&lt;/math&gt;

For a ball dropped against a floor, the COR will therefore vary between 0 (no bounce, total loss of energy) and 1 (perfectly bouncy, no energy loss). A COR value below 0 or above 1 is theoretically possible, but would indicate that the ball went ''through'' the surface ({{nowrap|''e'' &lt; 0}}), or that the surface was not "relaxed" when the ball impacted it ({{nowrap|''e'' &gt; 1}}), like in the case of a ball landing on spring-loaded platform.

To analyze the vertical and horizontal components of the motion, the COR is sometimes split up into a ''[[normal (vector)|normal]]'' COR (''e''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;), and ''[[tangential]]'' COR (''e''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), defined as&lt;ref name=Cross2006/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;e_\text{y} = -\frac{v_\text{yf} - u_\text{yf}}{v_\text{yi} - u_\text{yi}},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;e_\text{x} = -\frac{(v_\text{xf}-r\omega_\text{f})-(u_\text{xf}-R\Omega_\text{f})}{(v_\text{xi}-r\omega_\text{i})-(u_\text{xi}-R\Omega_\text{i})},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''r'' and ''&amp;omega;'' denote the radius and angular velocity of the ball, while ''R'' and ''&amp;Omega;'' denote the radius and angular velocity the impacting surface (such as a baseball bat). In particular ''r&amp;omega;'' is the [[tangential velocity]] of the ball's surface, while ''R&amp;Omega;'' is the tangential velocity of the impacting surface. These are especially of interest when the ball impacts the surface at an [[oblique angle]], or when [[rotation]] is involved.

For a straight drop on the ground with no rotation, with only the force of gravity acting on the ball, the COR can be related to several other quantities by:&lt;ref name=Georgallas2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Haron2012/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;e = \left|\frac{v_\text{f}}{v_\text{i}}\right| = \sqrt{\frac{K_\text{f}}{K_\text{i}}} = \sqrt{\frac{U_\text{f}}{U_\text{i}}} = \sqrt{\frac{H_\text{f}}{H_\text{i}}} = \frac{T_\text{f}}{T_\text{i}} =\sqrt{\frac{gT^2_\text{f}}{8H_\text{i}}}.&lt;/math&gt;
Here, ''K'' and ''U'' denote the [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] and [[potential energy]] of the ball, ''H'' is the maximum height of the ball, and ''T'' is the time of flight of the ball. The 'i' and 'f' subscript refer to the initial (before impact) and final (after impact) states of the ball. Likewise, the energy loss at impact can be related to the COR by
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Energy Loss} = \frac{{K_\text{i}}-{K_\text{f}}}{K_\text{i}} \times 100\% = \left( 1 - e^2 \right) \times 100\%.&lt;/math&gt;

The COR of a ball can be affected by several things, mainly
* the nature of the impacting surface (e.g. grass, concrete, wire mesh)&lt;ref name=Haron2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cross2000/&gt;
* the material of the ball (e.g. leather, rubber, plastic)&lt;ref name=Georgallas2016/&gt;
* the pressure inside the ball (if hollow)&lt;ref name=Georgallas2016/&gt;
* the amount of rotation induced in the ball at impact&lt;ref name=Cross2002/&gt;
* the impact velocity&lt;ref name=Cross1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=Georgallas2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cross2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zhang2002/&gt;

External conditions such as [[temperature]] can change the properties of the impacting surface or of the ball, making them either more flexible or more rigid. This will, in turn, affect the COR.&lt;ref name=Georgallas2016/&gt; In general, the ball will deform more at higher impact velocities and will accordingly lose more of its energy, decreasing its COR.&lt;ref name=Georgallas2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zhang2002/&gt;

===Spin and angle of impact===
[[File:Impact with spin.svg|thumb|250px|The forces acting on a spinning ball during impact are the [[force of gravity]], the [[normal force]], and the [[force of friction]] (which has in general both a 'translational' and a 'rotational' component). If the surface is angled, the force of gravity would be at an angle from the surface, while the other forces would remain perpendicular or parallel to the surface.]]

Upon impacting the ground, some [[translational kinetic energy]] can be converted to [[rotational energy|rotational kinetic energy]] and vice versa depending on the ball's impact angle and angular velocity. If the ball moves horizontally at impact, friction will have a 'translational' component in the direction opposite to the ball's motion. In the figure, the ball is moving to the ''right'', and thus it will have a translational component of friction pushing the ball to the ''left''. Additionally, if the ball is spinning at impact, friction will have a 'rotational' component in the direction opposite to the ball's rotation. On the figure, the ball is spinning clockwise, and the point impacting the ground is moving to the ''left'' with respect to the ball's [[center of mass]]. The rotational component of friction is therefore pushing the ball to the ''right''. Unlike the normal force and the force of gravity, these frictional forces will exert a [[torque]] on the ball, and change its angular velocity (''&amp;omega;'').&lt;ref name="Hesser-Knoll2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lindsey2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Allen2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cross2005/&gt;

Three situations can arise:&lt;ref name=Cross2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Allen2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jaffri2004/&gt;
#If a ball is propelled forward with ''[[backspin]]'', the translational and rotational friction will act in the same directions. The ball's angular velocity will be reduced after impact, as will its horizontal velocity, and the ball is propelled ''upwards'', possibly even exceeding its original height. It is also possible for the ball to start spinning in the opposite direction, and even bounce backwards.
#If a ball is propelled forward with ''[[topspin]]'', the translational and rotational friction act will act in opposite directions. What exactly happens depends on which of the two components dominate.
## If the ball is spinning much more rapidly than it was moving, rotational friction will dominate. The ball's angular velocity will be reduced after impact, but its horizontal velocity will be increased. The ball will be propelled ''forward'' but will not exceed its original height, and will keep spinning in the same direction.
## If the ball is moving much more rapidly than it was spinning, translational friction will dominate. The ball's angular velocity will be increased after impact, but its horizontal velocity will be decreased. The ball will not exceed its original height and will keep spinning in the same direction.

If the surface is inclined by some amount ''&amp;theta;'', the entire diagram would be rotated by ''&amp;theta;'', but the force of gravity would remain pointing downwards (forming an angle ''&amp;theta;'' with the surface). Gravity would then have a component parallel to the surface, which would contribute to friction, and thus contribute to rotation.&lt;ref name=Cross2005/&gt;

In [[racquet sports]] such as [[table tennis]] or [[racquetball]], skilled players will use spin (including [[sidespin]]) to suddenly alter the ball's direction when it impacts surface, such as the ground or their opponent's [[racquet]].

===Non-spherical balls===
[[File:Football FBD.svg|thumb|250px|The forces acting on a [[ball (gridiron football)|gridiron football ball]] or [[rugby ball]] at impact are the [[force of gravity]], the [[normal force]], and the [[force of friction]]. Friction will normally have a 'longitudinal' component due to the ball's velocity and 'tumbling' spin and a 'sideways' component due to the 'on-axis' spin of the ball induced by the throw.]]
The bounce of an oval-shaped ball (such as those used in [[gridiron football]] or [[rugby football]]) is in general much less predictable than the bounce of a spherical ball. Depending on the ball's alignment at impact, the [[normal force]] can act ahead or behind the [[centre of mass]] of the ball, and [[friction]] from the ground will depend on the alignment of the ball, as well as its rotation, spin, and impact velocity. Where the forces act with respect to the centre of mass of the ball changes as the ball rolls on the ground, and all forces can exert a [[torque]] on the ball, including the normal force and the force of gravity. This can cause the ball to bounce forward, bounce back, or sideways. Because it is possible to transfer some rotational kinetic energy into translational kinetic energy, it is even possible for the COR to be greater than 1, or for the forward velocity of the ball to increase upon impact.&lt;ref name=Cross2011/&gt;

===Multiple stacked balls ===

A popular demonstration involves the bounce of multiple stacked balls. If a tennis ball is stacked on top of a basketball, and the two of them are dropped at the same time, the tennis ball will bounce much higher than it would have if dropped on its own, even exceeding its original release height.&lt;ref name=Huebner1992/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cross2007/&gt; The result is surprising as it apparently violates conservation of energy.&lt;ref name=Hartner1971/&gt; However, upon closer inspection, the basketball does not bounce as high as it would have if the tennis ball had not been on top of it, and transferred some of its energy into the tennis ball, propelling it to a greater height.&lt;ref name=Huebner1992/&gt;

The usual explanation involves considering two separate impacts: the basketball impacting with the floor, and then the basketball impacting with the tennis ball.&lt;ref name=Huebner1992/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cross2007/&gt; Assuming perfectly [[elastic collision]]s, the basketball impacting the floor at 1&amp;nbsp;m/s would rebound at 1&amp;nbsp;m/s. The tennis ball going at 1&amp;nbsp;m/s would then have a relative impact velocity of 2&amp;nbsp;m/s, which means it would rebound at 2&amp;nbsp;m/s relative to the basketball, or 3&amp;nbsp;m/s relative to the floor, and ''triple'' its rebound velocity compared to impacting the floor on its own. This implies that the ball would bounce to ''9 times'' its original height.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Since conservation of mechanical energy implies &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \frac{1}{2}mv_\text{f}^2 = mgH_\text{f}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\textstyle H_\text{f} \propto v^2_\text{f}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
In reality, due to [[inelastic collision]]s, the tennis ball will increase its velocity and rebound height by a smaller factor, but still will bounce faster and higher than it would have on its own.&lt;ref name=Cross2007/&gt;

While the assumptions of separate impacts is not actually valid (the balls remain in close contact with each other during most of the impact), this model will nonetheless reproduce experimental results with good agreement,&lt;ref name=Cross2007/&gt; and is often used to understand more complex phenomena such as the [[Type II supernova#Core collapse|core collapse]] of [[supernova]]e,&lt;ref name=Huebner1992/&gt; or [[gravity assist|gravitational slingshot manoeuvres]].&lt;ref name=HyperphysicsDoubleBallDrop/&gt;

==Sport regulations==
{{See also|Regulation of sport}}
Several [[sports governing body|sports governing bodies]] regulate the bounciness of a ball through various ways, some direct, some indirect.
* [[Australian Football League|AFL]]: Regulates the [[gauge pressure]] of the [[Football (ball)#Australian rules football|football]] to be between {{val|62|u=kPa}} and {{val|76|u=kPa}}.&lt;ref name=AFL/&gt;
* [[FIBA]]: Regulates the gauge pressure so the [[basketball (ball)|basketball]] bounces between 1200&amp;nbsp;mm and 1400&amp;nbsp;mm (top of the ball) when it is dropped from a height of 1800&amp;nbsp;mm (bottom of the ball).&lt;ref name=FIBA/&gt; This roughly corresponds to a COR of 0.727 to 0.806.&lt;ref name="calc" group="note"&gt;Calculated using &lt;math&gt;\textstyle e = \sqrt{\frac{H_\text{f}}{H_\text{i}}}&lt;/math&gt; and (if applicable) the diameter of the ball. The calculation assumes air resistance is negligible.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[FIFA]]: Regulates the gauge pressure of the [[Ball (association football)|soccer ball]] to be between of {{val|0.6|ul=atm}} and {{val|1.1|u=atm}} at [[sea level]] (61 to 111&amp;nbsp;[[kPa]]).&lt;ref name=FIFA/&gt;
* [[FIVB]]: Regulates the gauge pressure of the [[volleyball (ball)|volleyball]] to be between {{val|0.30|u=[[kilogram-force|kg&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;]]/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} to {{val|0.325|u=kg&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} (29.4 to 31.9&amp;nbsp;kPa) for [[indoor volleyball]], and {{val|0.175|u=[[kilogram-force|kg&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;]]/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} to {{val|0.225|u=kg&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} (17.2 to 22.1&amp;nbsp;kPa) for [[beach volleyball]].&lt;ref name=FIVB-Indoor/&gt;&lt;ref name=FIVB-Beach/&gt;
* [[International Tennis Federation|ITF]]: Regulates the height of the [[tennis ball]] bounce when dropped on a "smooth, rigid and horizontal block of high mass". Different types of ball are allowed for different types of surfaces. When dropped from a height of {{convert|100|in|cm|sigfig=3}}, the bounce must be {{convert|54|–|60|in|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} for Type 1 balls, {{convert|53|–|58|in|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} for Type 2 and Type 3 balls, and {{convert|48|–|53|in|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} for High Altitude balls.&lt;ref name=ITF/&gt; This roughly corresponds to a COR of 0.735–0.775 (Type 1 ball), 0.728–0.762 (Type 2 &amp; 3 balls), and 0.693–0.728 (High Altitude balls) when dropped on the testing surface.&lt;ref name="calc" group=note/&gt;
* [[International Table Tennis Federation|ITTF]]: Regulates the playing surface so that the [[table tennis#ball|table tennis ball]] bounces approximately 23&amp;nbsp;cm when dropped from a height of 30&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name=ITTF/&gt; This roughly corresponds to a COR of about 0.876 against the playing surface.&lt;ref name="calc" group=note/&gt;
* [[NBA]]: Regulates the gauge pressure of the [[basketball (ball)|basketball]] to be between 7.5 and 8.5&amp;nbsp;[[pounds per square inch|psi]] (51.7 to 58.6 kPa).&lt;ref name=NBA/&gt;
*[[NFL]]: Regulates the gauge pressure of the [[Ball (gridiron football)|American football]] to be between 12.5 and 13.5&amp;nbsp;psi (86 to 93&amp;nbsp;kPa).&lt;ref name=NFL/&gt;
* [[The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews|R&amp;A]]/[[USGA]]: Limits the COR of the [[golf ball]] directly, which should not exceed 0.83 against a [[golf club]].&lt;ref name="RA-USGA"/&gt;

The pressure of an American football was at the center of the [[deflategate]] controversy.&lt;ref name=Botelho2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Well2015/&gt; Some sports do not regulate the bouncing properties of balls directly, but instead specify a construction method. In [[baseball]], the introduction of a cork-based ball helped to end the [[dead-ball era]] and trigger the [[live-ball era]].&lt;ref name=BaseballDigest1963/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sowell2011/&gt;

[[File:1876boxscore.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A baseball box score from 1876.]]
A '''box score''' is a structured summary of the results from a [[sport]] competition. The box score lists the game [[Score (sport)|score]] as well as individual and team achievements in the game.

Among the sports in which box scores are common are [[baseball]], [[basketball]], [[football]] and [[hockey]].

==Background==
The box score data is derived from a statistics sheet, and is then summarized into a contingency table, also known as a cross tabulation or cross tab or as a basic set of averages. This is used to help determine the relationship between elements, and in sports, certain percentages often help define the success of a team. This information is then correlated to a player, or a team where it is read to obtain a general idea of how the game was played or how the player performed during the game, a season, or their career.&lt;ref&gt;1Courel, Javier; Suárez, Ernesto; Ortega, Enrique; Piñar, Maribel; Cárdenas, David. “Is the inside pass a performance indicator?

'''Chinese Wand''' Exercise is an obscure ancient [[exercise]] system, related to the martial art [[Kung Fu]].  The “wand” in Chinese Wand Exercise is a 48-50” long dowel, 1” in diameter, (wood or [[bamboo]], for example), used as a [[Fulcrum (mechanics)|fulcrum]] for balance, form and posture. “It’s the [[pyramid effect]], with you as center.”&lt;ref name="Lanie Frame"&gt;Lanie Frame “Chinese Wand Exercises ‘Key to Perfect Health’” (March 1978) Daily Herald-News&lt;/ref&gt;	“Seventeen gentle bending, twisting and lunging  movements flow in exact order, specially designed to get the blood circulating more efficiently throughout the body.&lt;ref&gt;Nelda Clemmons “Chinese wand exercises a little magic” (December  1977) The Tampa Times&lt;/ref&gt; These exercises are done in gradual, easy ‘Stages’ while using an original Chinese deep-breathing technique” and [[chi energy]], and can be easy or more challenging as the individual chooses.&lt;ref name="Bruce L. Johnson"&gt;Chinese Wand Exercise by Bruce L. Johnson. William Morrow &amp; Co. Inc., 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

Together they exercise every major muscle in the body and take no more than 20 minutes to complete. The relative ease of the 17 moves (11 standing and six floor exercises) engage all the organs and muscles of the body together in harmony rather than separating out one part of the body from another. This produces a more efficient way of staying fit and healthy by increasing and balancing the chi energy.

“Chinese Wand prevents illness and delays the aging process of many cells.”&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Mike, “Chinese Wand Exercises: Integrating Body, Mind and Spirit,” San Fernando Valley Magazine, June 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; Together, they exercise the entire body safely and gently. Chinese Wand was known as a “preventive” of disease while [[acupuncture]] was the “treatment.”

==History in China==

Although awareness of its existence is recent, Chinese Wand is said to be thousands of years old.&lt;ref name="Lanie Frame"/&gt; It was passed down through Grand Masters and kept private for the use of the succeeding Chinese rulers and their families. They were devised for the emperor to slow down the aging process and maintain perfect health.&lt;ref name="Mary Jane Hunter"&gt;Mary Jane Hunter, “Exercises for young and old.” March 1978, News-Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The exercises were derived from studying animals at play in [[nature]], hence some of the names of the forms: “Springing of the Tiger,” “Raising of the Bird’s Wing,” “Panda Rolls,” to name a few.&lt;ref name="Bruce L. Johnson"/&gt; Chinese wand is not by itself taught as a method of self-defense.

It should be noted that the source of all current information stems from Bruce L. Johnson, who is currently the only known living Grand Master of Chinese Wand.

==Coming To America==

According to Johnson, when he was 19 he learned the exercises from 93-year-old Grand Master Ch’eng in 1945. He and two [[United States Navy|Navy]] buddies, all wrestlers, were exploring [[Shanghai]] and were amazed by an 80-year-old rickshaw man’s ability to pull a wide [[Pulled rickshaw|rickshaw]] with the three muscular seamen up and down the steep hills of Shanghai. Johnson pursued the slight Chinese man who eventually led him to the slender, regal Grand Master. Upon meeting Dr. Ch’eng at his home in Shanghai, the tall, 235-pound 19-year-old was unable to take down the 130&amp;nbsp;lb.  Ch’eng who, seemingly inexplicably, fended him off and left him lying on the floor after each of three increasingly aggressive advances. He used an ancient “spinning” technique. Johnson, convinced that he had to learn everything this man could teach, was soon accepted as a student by Ch’eng, who was no doubt impressed and amused by the young headstrong man’s potential and enthusiasm for learning all he could.  Eventually Dr. Ch’eng, having lost his sons in the war between China and Japan, trusted Johnson enough to pass on the knowledge and techniques he would need to become the next Grand Master.&lt;ref name="Bruce L. Johnson"/&gt;

==Biography of Grand Master Bruce L. Johnson==

[[Minnesota]]-raised Bruce Leroy Johnson, (June 21, 1926- December 11, 2014) was a sickly child who overcame his early beginnings through exercise and [[body-building]].  Health and [[physical fitness]] became a lifelong passion, as well as a quest to stay young and embrace Nature.

After high school, during [[World War II]],  the handsome blue-eyed, black-haired (of Swedish and Iroquois descent) Johnson became a [[Navy]] heavyweight wrestling champion&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Hiebert, “Afton Adonis is Married to the Oceans”, Oliver Towne&lt;/ref&gt; who excelled in physical exploits and competitions.  He also was a [[navy ranger]], and one of the first to reach the shores of [[Iwo Jima]]. His mother’s sister was married to revered World War II [[journalist]] and author, [[Ernie Pyle]], with whom Bruce had a close relationship and who was killed only a few miles from where Johnson was, on the island of [[Ie Shima]].&lt;ref&gt;Palm Beach Post-Times, April 19, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; He is often called upon to accept memorial awards on behalf of his uncle.&lt;ref&gt;“Pyle’s Death is Recalled,” Honolulu Adviser, April 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Joe Rafferty"&gt;Joe Rafferty,  “’Bamboozle’ Weighty Problems with the Ancient Chinese Wand Exercises,” Norwich Bulletin, October 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson studied at the [[Kodokan Institute]] in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] where he earned three [[black belts]] in [[Judo]].&lt;ref&gt;Alison Wyrley Birch, “The Magic in a Wand of Bamboo.” November 1975, The Sunday Republican&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in the states after World War II, Johnson tried to introduce the merits of the exercise [[system]]. But because of [[McCarthyism]] and the fear of [[Communism]], there was little enthusiasm about anything Asian. Few showed interest in learning the unusual, oriental exercises.

Meanwhile, wanderlust led Johnson around the world finding work, often on ships. He was a [[bodyguard]] for [[King Farouk]] for a time. Wherever he went in the world, he sought out others who might have heard of Chinese Wand, even placing ads in local papers. But he never found anyone. As far as he knew, he was the only one who knew about it.  Johnson spent time in [[Hollywood]] and found a small group of [[health food]] and fitness enthusiasts such as [[Mae West]], [[Jimmy Durante]], and others who became students.&lt;ref&gt;Nelda Clemmons, “Chinese wand exercises a little magic,” December 1977, The Tampa Times&lt;/ref&gt; It has been rumored that he might have been the inspiration for the song “[[Nature Boy]]” (popularized by [[Nat King Cole]]) when he claimed he spent time with the songwriter, [[Eden Ahbez]]. Later, he taught celebrities such as [[James Coburn]] who was photographed in [[People Magazine]] doing the exercises.&lt;ref&gt;“Over the Tube”, People Magazine, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson became friends with [[Bruce Lee]], and the two did demonstrations of strength and speed together. “Bruce [Lee] was the only man who could ever ‘handle’ me - of course, he never knew Dr. Cheng.”&lt;ref name="Karen Kaye"&gt;Karen Kaye, “Bruce Johnson and his Amazing Chinese Wand”  Los Angeles Free Press, October 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Lee was quoted in Johnson’s book as saying, “All things are possible with the great Masters.”&lt;ref name="Lanie Frame"/&gt;

In 1965, Johnson became a hero when he rescued three children from a shark in the [[Bahamas]] by swimming out and averting its attention . A fourth child was killed. Armed with only a pointed shell he grabbed on the beach, he fought the beast a full five minutes underwater, his leg in its mouth until he jabbed its eye with the shell and was able to escape, barely making it to shore.&lt;ref name="The Secret Strength"&gt;”The Secret Strength of Bruce Johnson”, Palm Beach Post-Times,
February 1973&lt;/ref&gt; He won international acclaim and was honored by heads of three governments.&lt;ref&gt;The Tribune, October 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

He caused another sensation in 1966 when he and a friend (who later became his wife) volunteered to spend an unspecified amount of time on an uninhabited [[Fiji|Fiji Island]] with no supplies, only bathing suits and camera equipment. Learning too late that the island was far from idyllic limited their stay to 40 days, but caused national publicity.&lt;ref&gt;Webster K. Nolan, “Island Paradise Lost… to Hunger and Rats”, UPI, January 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dramatic adventures seemed to follow the elusive Johnson who often found himself at the right place in time to rescue others from extreme danger (over 50 documented at the risk of his own life) including fires, mangled cars, even abusive husbands.

Johnson rarely spoke of his powers as a [[mysticism|mystic]]. Students would sometimes notice [[supernatural]] transformations in his appearance as he taught the class.  He was inclined to believe that Dr. Ch’eng was teaching through him. One famous [[psychic]] of his day, [[Peter Hurkos]], upon meeting Johnson said, “Who is that beautiful Chinese man coming out of you?”&lt;ref name="Joe Rafferty"/&gt;

Others saw Johnson transform: after a class in [[Eureka, California]], a young student “asked him if he knew that he had become transformed into a Chinese person while he was performing the wand exercises. . .Did you see it too?...” another classmate added.&lt;ref name="Joe Rafferty"/&gt;

It has also been said that the late Dr. Ch'eng's formidable, otherworldly presence was physically tangible, gentle, even erotic.

Enthusiasm for Chinese Wand was minimal until a nationwide curiosity in [[Eastern philosophy]] erupted in the 1960s, beginning with the [[Beatles]]’ trip to [[India]] and the subsequent publicity. Interest in meditation techniques, [[yoga]], martial arts, and other esoteric practices spiked.  At last, Johnson was able to develop classes. Eventually, he self-published a book in 1975.

In December 1976, Johnson, who also worked as a professional diver, was seriously injured in an underwater accident and sustained a near-fatal brain stem infarct causing [[Stroke symptoms|stroke-like symptoms]].&lt;ref name="Mary Jane Hunter"/&gt; Initially told he would never walk again, he once again defied odds and within a matter of months,  was walking and looking as healthy as ever.&lt;ref name="Karen Kaye"/&gt;

Although still reeling from lingering and painful after-effects of the trauma, he managed to generate interest from a major publisher ([[William Morrow and Company|William Morrow]], [[New York City|New York]]) who published his book in hardcover in 1977.

During the time he was striving to regain his health, he underwent a  [[Christian]] “[[born-again]]” experience that eventually influenced his thinking and upended his belief system. He slowly rejected a [[holistic]] awareness of consciousness and abandoned his lifelong allegiance to preserving and re-introducing the teachings of Dr. Ch’eng and the art of Chinese Wand.  The spreading of a popular desire to learn the more violent aspects of martial arts and the potential “danger” of involvement with the [[supernatural]] conflicted with his newfound [[ultra-conservative]] Christian views. Efforts to promote Chinese Wand diminished and eventually disappeared from public view.

“--Oriental philosophy is at their [martial arts] heart,” Johnson says. “These things are not from [[God]], as God is not in the business of [[mystical]] energies or the [[occult]]. . .I no longer practice the martial arts …as a Christian, I cannot in good conscience, teach or recommend the martial arts to others.”&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of New Age Beliefs by John Ankerberg &amp; John Weldon c. 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chinese Wand Today==

Even though Johnson’s book is no longer in print, the web and [[YouTube]] videos are generating a resurgence of the practice in the U.S. and the U.K. in particular. A new generation of students are learning what they can from Johnson’s book, sometimes by changing the name slightly (e.g. `Chi Stix', 'Stick Yoga,' or `[[Jian Gan]] - Chinese Health Wand') to avoid copyright infringement on Johnson's original text.

Sadly, it appears that Johnson did not train anyone to carry on this unique art as the next Grand Master. Because of this, apart from the basic exercises, the remaining 190 exercises, more esoteric practices and knowledge, are probably lost.

	“I am the last of the Grand Masters [of Chinese Wand]. When I go, the secret goes with me.”&lt;ref name="The Secret Strength"/&gt;

==The Future==

Although Johnson is the last Grand Master his book opened the art up to the wider population. He wanted his book to be in every nursing home, every hospital, every physical therapy room, every doctor's office for the doctor to prescribe the exercises to patients - in every home so families could practice together; he also hoped that workers in offices and factories could practice the exercises together to increase productivity and health of workforce and that physical fitness instructors in schools and colleges would adopt the system.
&lt;ref name="Bruce L. Johnson"/&gt;

Some in the Chinese martial arts and Qigong community are now taking a serious interest in the Chinese Wand and promoting its use as a social exercise the way Johnson envisaged. A new book on the subject examines the esoteric aspects of the art and its origins and influences - and encourages dialogue within China itself.&lt;ref name="Michael Davies"&gt;Jiangan - Chinese Health Wand by Michael Davies, Singing Dragon, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
The link with China was very much in Johnson's thoughts. He was curious whether someone was still practicing in a remote region of China &lt;ref name="The Day"&gt;The Day, New London Connecticut, September 9, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; and intended to take the art back to China himself:-

"In China they now do Tai Chi, but my one ambition is to return there and bring their ancient Chinese exercises full circle." &lt;ref name="Victoria Advocate"&gt;The Victoria Advocate, April 4, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

In American and Canadian [[sports]], a '''fight song''' is a [[song]] associated with a [[team]]. In both [[professional]] and [[amateur sports]], fight songs are a popular way for fans to cheer for their team, and are also laden with history; in singing a fight song, fans feel part of a large, time-honored tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://cheerleading.lovetoknow.com/High_School_Fight_Songs|title=High School Fight Songs {{!}} LoveToKnow|work=LoveToKnow|access-date=2017-11-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term "fight song" is primarily used in the United States, the use of fight songs is commonplace around the world, but they may also be referred to as '''team anthems''', '''team songs''' or '''games songs''' in other countries, even such as [[Australia]], [[Mexico]] and [[New Zealand]]. Fight songs differ from [[stadium anthem]]s, used for similar purposes, in that they are usually written specifically for the purposes of the team, whereas stadium anthems are not.

Hundreds of [[college]]s have fight songs, some of which are over a century old. The oldest collegiate fight song in the United States is [[Boston College#For Boston|Boston College's]] "For Boston", composed by T.J. Hurley in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://at.bc.edu/songsofbc/ |title=@BC » Feature Archive » Beyond "For Boston" |publisher=At.bc.edu |date=2008-04-29 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the oldest games songs in Australia is [[Melbourne Grammar]]'s 'Play Together, Dark Blue Twenty', which is sung to the tune of '[[Men of Harlech|The March of the Men of Harlech]]'.&lt;ref&gt;The Melbourne Grammar games song comprises verses from the school's three main sports at the time, Australian rules football, cricket and rowing. For example the Australian rules verse is:

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;'Play together, Dark Blue Twenty,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Long and little marks in plenty;

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Get your kick, let none prevent ye,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Make the leather roll.

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Mark your men, keen effort straining,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;On the ball and show your training;

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Still though short the time remaining,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Get another goal.'

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;The chorus between each verse is:

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;'None our ranks shall sunder.

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Who will shirk or blunder?

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;If all are true

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;To our Dark Blue,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Our foemen must go under.

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Honour ye the old School’s story,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Those who played and won before ye,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Bear the Dark Blue flag to glory,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Grammar to the fore.'

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;The cricket verse:

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Bat with patience unremitting,
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Yorker, shooter, break outwitting,
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;All the loose ones freely hitting,
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;That’s the game to play.
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Skill the bat and ball in wielding,
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Smartness, judgement in the fielding,
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Iron nerve and pluck unyielding,
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Scarce can lose the day.

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;The rowing verse:

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Row the race, boys swing together,
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Sinews tough as cords of leather,
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Strong, yet light upon the feather,
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Lift her, make her go!
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Get the catch at the beginning,
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Churn the tide in eddies spinning,
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Now a spurt, you gain! you’re winning!
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Melbourne Grammar, row!

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;A fourth verse with its own chorus was added in the early 20th century with imperial connotations:

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;'Some, in strife of sterner omen,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Faced the Empire’s stubborn foemen;

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Fought, as erst their sires - her yeomen;

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Won the deathless name.

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Praise ye these who stood for Britain,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;These by foreign marksmen smitten;

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Praise them, for their names are written

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;High in storied fame.

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;None their ranks could sunder;

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Who could shirk or blunder?

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;So stood they true

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;To the old Dark Blue,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;And all their foes went under.

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Honour ye the old School’s story,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Heroes who - her sons before ye -

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Died or lived, but fought for glory,

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Honoured evermore.'

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;While it is not officially discontinued, this addition is no longer sung.

==List of college fight songs==
''Notes:''
*Colleges whose names begin with "University of" or "College of" are listed by traditional name; for example, the [[University of Cincinnati]] is listed under ''C'', not ''U''.
*The service academies are universally referred to in sports media by their associated branch of service. This means, for example, that the [[United States Military Academy]] is found at ''A'', for ''Army''.
* The abbreviation "St.", standing for "Saint", is alphabetized as if it were spelled out. Some schools officially abbreviate the word (such as [[St. John's University (New York City)|St. John's University]] in New York City), while others officially spell it out (such as [[Saint Louis University]]).
*Schools which are normally known by a different contraction of their official name, or an acronym/initialism, are listed by their most common name. Examples:
**The [[University of California, Berkeley]] is most often referred to by American sports media as either "California" or "Cal", meaning it can be found at ''C''.
**The [[University of California, Los Angeles]] is generally called "UCLA", meaning it can be found at ''U''.
** A few branch campuses of state university systems prefer to be known by their city for athletics purposes. Among them are the [[University of North Carolina at Charlotte]] ("Charlotte"), [[University of Tennessee at Chattanooga]] ("Chattanooga"), [[University of Nebraska Omaha]] ("Omaha"), [[University of Wisconsin–Green Bay]] ("Green Bay"), and [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]] ("Milwaukee"). Such schools can be found at the first letter of their city name.
*Other regional campuses, such as [[California State University, Fresno]], are listed by their regional name, meaning the aforementioned school can be found under ''F''.

'''Flexible Flyer''' is a toy and recreational equipment brand, best known for the sled of the same name, a steerable wooden [[sled]] with steel runners.

== Operation ==

Flexible Fliers are flexible both in design and usage. Riders may sit upright on the sled or lie on their stomachs, allowing the possibility to descend a snowy slope feet-first or head-first.  To steer the sled, riders may either push on the wooden cross piece with their hands or feet, or pull on the rope attached to the wooden cross-piece.  Shifting the cross-piece one way or the other causes the flexible rails to bend, turning the sled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/TODAY-IN-PHILADELPHIA-HISTORY/Samuel-Leeds-Allen-patents-the-Flexible-Flyer.html Samuel Leeds Allen patents the Flexible Flyer - Today in Philadelphia History]&lt;/ref&gt;

Flexible Flyers work best on hard packed or icy snow.  If the snow is soft and deep, the sled's runners are likely to sink in and prevent the sled from moving.

== History ==

[[File:Flexible Flyer Ad.jpg|thumb|left|Flexible Flyer ad from the early 1900s]]

[[Samuel Leeds Allen]] [[patented]] the Flexible Flyer in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.westtown.edu/about-westtown/history/more-history/sledding-at-westtown/index.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Cinnaminson, New Jersey]] using local children and adults to test prototypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last = Hatala   | first = Greg   | title = Made in Jersey: Flexible Flyer - The sled from south Jersey   | publisher = The Star-Ledger   | date = January 7, 2014   | url = http://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2014/01/made_in_jersey_flexible_flyer_-_the_sled_from_south_jersey.html#incart_river#incart_hbx#incart_best-of   | accessdate = 2013-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Allen's company flourished by selling these speedy and yet controllable sleds at a time when others were still producing [[toboggans]] and "gooseneck" sleds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Pellegrini|editor-first=Anthony D.|title=The future of play theory: a multidisciplinary inquiry into the contributions of Brian Sutton-Smith|year=1995|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-2641-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8_NBW3q__PgC&amp;dq=flexible+flyer+history&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|author=Bernard Mergen|chapter=Past play: relics, memory, and history|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen began producing sleds in his [[farm equipment]] factory to keep his workers busy even when it was not the farm season.  He developed many prototypes before he created the Flexible Flyer.  The sleds did not sell well until he began marketing them to the toy departments of [[department stores]].  In 1915, around 120,000 Flexible Fliers were sold, and almost 2,000 Flexible Flyers were sold in one day. 

In 1968, Leisure Group of Los Angeles, California bought the S. L. Allen Company.  Leisure Group continued to produce Flexible Flyers in [[Medina, Ohio]].  In 1973, a group of [[private investors]] bought Leisure Group's toy division and started manufacturing the sleds under the name "Blazon Flexible Flyer" in [[West Point, Mississippi]].  In 1993, Roadmaster purchased the rights to production and moved production to [[Olney, Illinois]], and in 1998, production was moved to China.  {{As of|2012}}, Flexible Flyers are mostly made in China and some are made in [[South Paris, Maine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/sports/outdoors/articles/2011/12/25/flexible_flyer_king_of_sleds_slides_on/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=Flexible Flyer, king of sleds, slides on | date=25 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Paricon, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;http://pariconsleds.com/index.php/classic-sleds.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In various sports, a '''forfeit''' is a method in which a match automatically ends and the forfeiting team loses.

There are two distinct forms of forfeiture. One occurs when a team is unable to meet the basic standards for playing the game, either before the game begins or as a result of actions that happen during the match. In such a case, the team not forfeiting wins the match. The other is ''punitive forfeiture'', in which a team has been found to have broken the rules of a sanctioning body during a match they have won and must have the results stricken from the record; whether or not the other team receives a win in such a case depends on the rules of that body.

== Association football ==
Both teams must have at least seven players at the beginning of the match per the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]]. When a team has fewer than seven players, the match cannot start or continue.&lt;ref&gt;[[IFAB]]: [http://www.theifab.com/#!/laws/the-players/chapters/number-of-players ''Laws of the Game 2016/2017''], Law 3&lt;/ref&gt; When the number of players in a team falls definitely below seven (e.g. by five players sent off with [[penalty card#Red card|red cards]], or by injured players with no substitutions left, or a combination of both), the match is forfeited. Forfeits are also used as ''ex post'' disciplinary sanctions by governing bodies.

A forfeited match is handled differently in various competitions; FIFA Disciplinary Code punishes the team sanctioned with a forfeit with a 3–0 loss (but the result on the pitch is upheld if the goal difference at the end of the match was greater than three).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/50/02/75/discoinhalte.pdf|title = FIFA Disciplinary Code|last =|first =|date = 2011|website = FIFA|publisher =|page = 21|access-date = 2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Baseball ==
{{Main|Forfeit (baseball)}}
In rare cases, [[baseball]] games are forfeited, usually in the event when a team is no longer able to play.

{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2014}}

== Basketball ==
In [[basketball]] rules published by FIBA, a forfeit and default are two different things. A team will forfeit if:
* Fifteen minutes after the scheduled starting time, the team is not present or is unable to field five players ready to play.
* Its actions prevent the game from being played.
* It refuses to play after being instructed to do so by the referee.
A forfeit results in loss for the offending team, a score of 20−0, and in tournaments that use the [[FIBA]] points system for standings, 0 points. Furthermore, in FIBA tournaments that use a two-game home-and-away series ([[two-legged tie]]) or a [[best-of-three playoff]] format, a team that forfeits any of the games loses the series by forfeit.

In FIBA tournaments, a forfeit is different from a default, a situation if during the game, the team has fewer than two players (e.g. one or zero players) on the playing court ready to play with no replacements on the bench remaining. In this case, the opponents are awarded with a win, and if they are leading, the score at the time of stoppage will be the final score; if they are not leading, they are awarded with a 2−0 win. Furthermore, in FIBA tournaments that use a two-game home-and-away series, a team that defaults in either game loses the series by default.

In tournaments and leagues that use [[winning percentage]] to rank teams, the difference between a forfeit and a default is negligible; however, for those that use the FIBA points system, a default is treated like an ordinary loss, as the team earns one point. Meanwhile, a team that forfeited earns no points. It is also more detrimental in tiebreaking situations as a defaulting team's worst result is the actual score if they were trailing when the game was stopped, or a 2–0 loss if they were trailing. A forfeit costs a 0–20 loss, and drags down a team's [[goal average]] worse than a 0–2 loss would.

In U.S. [[NCAA]] basketball, a referee decides a game is to be forfeited when any of these criteria are satisfied:
* Any player, squad member or bench personnel fails to comply with any technical-foul penalty or makes a travesty of the game.
* When conditions warrant.
* A team refuses to play after being instructed to do so by an official.
The forfeiting team loses the game 2−0, unless 30 minutes have lapsed in the game clock; in this case, the score at the end of play shall stand. When the team that is behind in the scorebook is to be declared the winning team, that score shall be marked with an asterisk in the official statistics; and it shall be noted that the game was won by forfeit.

The rules of the [[National Basketball Association]] do not mention how forfeitures are dealt with, but mention it is a possible sanction on a player or coach who violates the rules on [[ejection (sports)|ejections]]. Also, in the NBA, defaulting is virtually impossible, unless ejections bring a team to fewer than five players.  When five players remain in a game, and one fouls out, a technical foul is called when a player who has fouled out is forced to remain in the game, or when, after an injury, a player who fouled out of the game previously returns to the game. These technical fouls are declared non-unsportsmanlike conduct fouls, for which no player or coach may be ejected.

== Chess ==
As well as [[checkmate]], [[chess]] games can be [[Rules_of_chess#Resigning|resigned]] or lost on [[Time control|time]], but the term "forfeit" generally has a narrower meaning in the game.

A forfeit occurs when a player does not appear at the match, and is generally a rare occurrence. A notable instance of forfeiture happened in the [[World_Chess_Championship_1972#Game_2:_Fischer_forfeits|second game]] of the [[World_Chess_Championship_1972|1972 World Chess Championship]]. [[Bobby Fisher]], due to disputes over the organisation of the match, refused to show, and the game was recorded as a win for his opponent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bobby Fischer Forfeits Second Chess Game {{!}} News {{!}} The Harvard Crimson |url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1972/7/14/bobby-fischer-forfeits-second-chess-game/ |accessdate=23 August 2018 |work=The Harvard Crimson |date=14 July 1972 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Additionally, a player caught [[cheating in chess|cheating]] will lose by forfeit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=FIDE/ACP Anti-Cheating Committee |title=Anti-Cheating Guidelines |url=https://www.fide.com/FIDE/handbook/Anti%20Cheating%20Guidelines.pdf |accessdate=23 August 2018 |pages=13 |date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cricket ==
{{Main|Declaration and forfeiture}}
In the sport of [[cricket]] a forfeiture occurs when a captain chooses to forfeit one of his side’s innings.

==Gaelic games==

In the [[Gaelic games]] of [[hurling]], [[Gaelic football]], [[camogie]] and [[ladies' Gaelic football]], a forfeit is called a ''walkover'' ({{Lang-ga|bua gan choimhlint}}). As well as losing the game, the team that gives a walkover in a competition may receive further punishment, such as a fine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leitrimobserver.ie/news/sport/227792/board-to-investigate-increasing-fines-for-clubs-failing-to-field-teams-in-the-league.html|title=Board to investigate increasing fines for clubs failing to field teams in the League|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://meath.gaa.ie/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Rialach%C3%A1in-2016_Regulations.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; deduction of league points or automatic [[relegation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.celbridgegaa.com/gaa/images/pdf/2016-d/Football-League-Rules-2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous walkover in [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] history came in the [[1910 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final]]; the match was scratched and Louth were awarded the championship as Kerry refused to travel to [[Dublin]] for the final because the [[Great Southern and Western Railway]] would not grant fans, players and officials discounted fares for the trip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terracetalk.com/articles/Memories/103/The-Kerry-Footballers-Strike-of-1910|title=The Kerry Footballers Strike of 1910|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dundalkdemocrat.ie/news/home/250281/historic-louth-all-ireland-winning-medals-set-to-go-under-the-hammer.html|title=Historic Louth All Ireland-winning medals set to go under the hammer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gridiron football ==
In [[American football]], a team must begin with at least eleven people ready to play; a forfeiture occurs if a team does not have that many. It can also occur when the number of able players drops to below seven (the number legally required to man a [[line of scrimmage]]) at any point during game time, as a result of an [[palpably unfair act|unfair act]], or punitive retroactive sanctions against a team from a governing body such as the [[NCAA]].

In the event the team forfeiting the game is already losing at the time of the forfeit, the score at the time stands as is. Otherwise, forfeits result in a 2-0 score in the [[National Football League]] or a 1-0 score in [[high school football]], [[NCAA]] and [[Canadian football]]. 

In the case of high school and the NCAA, the forfeit is one of only two ways to finish with a score of only one point (the other is if a team's only score comes from a botched [[conversion (gridiron football)|conversion attempt]] that results in their opponent getting backed all the way back into their own end zone).

The [[National Football League]] rulebook has a provision for forfeiture but has never used it (there was at least one alleged "forfeit" in the [[1921 NFL season]], but because league schedules were so fluid in the 1920s and it was never clear who was at fault for the game not being played, the league now considers it a cancellation, which was very common at the time). Former NFL commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] noted that he had never used the league's forfeit provisions and would never change the result of a game after the fact, a stance that prevented the result of the [[Snowplow Game]], a game that had been decided on an acknowledged but unpunished unfair act, from being forfeited. It was briefly discussed as a potential punishment during [[2007 National Football League videotaping controversy|Spygate]] but never implemented. 

The NCAA also uses punitive forfeiture in other sports. The [[Arena Football League]] has had one forfeit in its history, which came in [[2012 Arena Football League season|2012]] as a result of a player's strike. In another case in [[2015 Arena Football League season|2015]], two teams ceased operations prior to the end of the season, and because they were both slated to play each other, the game was recorded as a scoreless tie.

A related concept is the ''vacation'', in which the team's wins are stricken from the record, but no loss is put in its place, and a team that lost in a game where the win was later vacated is still counted as a loss. The NCAA bylaws allow wins to be vacated as a form of punishment; the NFL does not.

== Poker ==
In cases where a poker game is arranged but an opponent drops out, that person forfeits and remaining players win at that player's expense.

[[File:University of Louisville marching band, Churchill Downs Twin Spires.jpg|thumb|The grandstand at [[Churchill Downs]]]]
A '''grandstand''' is a large and normally permanent [[structure]] for [[Seating assignment|seat]]ing spectators, most often at a [[racetrack]].  This includes both [[auto racing]] and [[horse racing]].  The grandstand is in essence like a single section of a [[stadium]], but differs from a stadium in that it does not wrap all or most of the way around.  Grandstands may have basic [[Bench (furniture)|bench]] seating, but usually have individual [[chair]]s like a stadium.  Grandstands are also usually covered with a [[roof]], but are open on the front.  They are often multi-tiered.

Grandstands are found at places like [[Epsom Downs Racecourse]] and [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]].  They may also be found at [[fair]]grounds, [[circus]]es, and outdoor [[arena]]s used for [[rodeo]]s.

In the [[United States]], smaller stands are called [[bleachers]], and are usually far more basic and typically single-tiered (hence the difference from a "grand stand"). Early baseball games were often staged at fairgrounds, and the term "grandstand" came along when standalone baseball parks began to be built. A covered bleacher may be called a "[[pavilion]]", also to distinguish from the main "grandstand".

==Grandstanding as a pejorative==
The pejorative verb "grandstanding" is often applied to politicians or other public figures perceived to be using tactics designed to call attention to themselves instead of the issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/grandstanding|title=Definition|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|accessdate=May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Greco-Roman''' ([[American English|US]]) or '''Graeco-Roman''' ([[British English|UK]]) '''wrestling''' is a style of [[wrestling]] that is practiced worldwide. It was contested at the first modern [[Olympic Games]] in 1896 and has been included in every edition of the summer Olympics held since 1908.&lt;ref name="fila_history"&gt;FILA Wrestling [http://www.fila-official.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=18&amp;Itemid=36 History of Greco-Roman Wrestling] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711000658/http://www.fila-official.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=18&amp;Itemid=36 |date=2011-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;This style of [[wrestling]] forbids [[Grappling hold|holds]] below the waist; this is the major difference from [[freestyle wrestling]], the other form of wrestling at the Olympics. This restriction results in an emphasis on [[throw (grappling)|throws]] because a wrestler cannot use trips to [[Takedown (grappling)|take]] an opponent to the ground, or avoid throws by hooking or grabbing the opponent's leg.

According to [[United World Wrestling]], Greco-Roman wrestling is one of the six main forms of amateur competitive [[wrestling]] practised internationally today. The other five forms are [[Freestyle wrestling]], [[Grappling]]/[[Submission wrestling]], [[Beach wrestling]], [[Pankration athlima]], [[Alysh]]/Belt wrestling and Traditional/[[Folk wrestling]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fila-wrestling.com Fila Wrestling : site de la Fédération Internationale des Luttes Associées&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{further|History of wrestling#Modern history}}
The name "Greco-Roman" was applied to this style of wrestling as a way of purporting it to be similar to the wrestling formerly found in the ancient civilizations surrounding the Mediterranean Sea especially at the ancient Greek Olympics. At that time, the  athletes initially  wore  skintight shorts  but  later  wrestled   each other  naked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Boyle |first1=A. |title=The Everyman Encyclopædia - Volume 12 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=w_8aAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=ancient++greco+roman++wrestling++wore++tight++shorts&amp;dq=ancient++greco+roman++wrestling++wore++tight++shorts&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjk1J_y4svcAhWPAYgKHar7CeA4ChDoAQgxMAI |publisher=J.M. Dent &amp; sons Limited - 2008 |accessdate=1  August  2017 |quote=At first the wrestlers wore tight-fitting  shorts - a girdle - but in later times they wrestled naked...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is speculated that many styles of European [[folk wrestling]] may have spurred the origins of Greco-Roman wrestling.&lt;ref name=PoliakoffGR1194&gt;"Wrestling, Greco-Roman" by Michael B. Poliakoff from ''Encyclopedia of World Sport: From Ancient Times to the Present'', Vol. 3, p. 1194, eds. David Levinson and Karen Christensen (Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[United World Wrestling]], a [[Napoleonic]] soldier named Jean Exbrayat first developed the style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=May|first1=William|title=Wrestling 101: Origins and Facts about Greco-Roman Wrestling|url=https://unitedworldwrestling.org/article/wrestling-101-origins-and-facts-about-greco-roman-wrestling|website=United World Wrestling|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exbrayat performed in fairs and called his style of wrestling "flat hand wrestling" to distinguish it from other forms of hand-to-hand combat that allowed striking. In 1848, Exbrayat established the rule that no holds below the waist were to be allowed; neither were painful holds or torsions that would hurt the opponent. "Flat hand wrestling" or "French wrestling" (as the style became known) developed all throughout Europe and became a popular sport. The Italian wrestler Basilio Bartoletti first coined the term "Greco-Roman" for the sport to underline the interest in "ancient values."&lt;ref name=FILAGrecoRomanPage&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; 
Many others in the 18th and 20th centuries sought to add value to their contemporary athletic practices by finding some connections with ancient counterparts. The 18th century work ''Gymnastics for Youth'' by [[Johann Christoph Friedrich GutsMuths|Johann Friedrich Guts Muths]] described a form of schoolboy wrestling called "orthopale" (used by [[Plato]] to describe the standing part of wrestling) that did not mention any lower-body holds.&lt;ref name="PoliakoffGR1194"/&gt; Real ancient wrestling was quite different;&lt;ref&gt;[http://judo4mma.com/greekwrestling/ancient%20greek%20submission%20wrestling.pdf Greek Wrestling Research Article]&lt;/ref&gt; see [[Greek wrestling]].&lt;ref name="FILAGrecoRomanPage" /&gt;
[[Image:GrecoRomanWrestling2.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Even on the mat, a Greco-Roman wrestler must still find ways to turn his opponent's shoulders to the mat for a fall without using the legs.]]

The British never really enjoyed Greco-Roman wrestling in comparison to its less restrictive counterpart, [[freestyle wrestling|freestyle]], and despite 
the efforts of [[William Muldoon]] (a successful New York barroom freestyle wrestler who served in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and learned the style in France) to promote it in the United States after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].
But on the continent, the style was highly promoted. Almost all the continental European capital cities hosted international Greco-Roman tournaments in the 19th century, with much prize money given to the place winners. For example, the [[Czar]] of Russia paid 500 francs for wrestlers to train and compete in his tournament, with 5,000 francs awarded as a prize to the tournament winner. Greco-Roman wrestling soon became prestigious in continental Europe&lt;ref name="PoliakoffGR1194" /&gt; and was the first style registered at the modern [[Olympic Games]], beginning in [[Athens]] in 1896 with one heavyweight bout,&lt;ref&gt;"Wrestling, Freestyle" by Michael B. Poliakoff from ''Encyclopedia of World Sport: From Ancient Times to the Present'', Vol. 3, p. 1190, eds. David Levinson and Karen Christensen (Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; and grew in popularity during the 20th century. It has always been featured in the Olympic Games, except during the Paris Olympic Games in 1900&lt;ref name="FILAGrecoRomanPage" /&gt; and the [[St. Louis]] Olympic Games of 1904, when freestyle first emerged as an Olympic sport.

Perhaps the most well-known of Greco-Roman wrestlers in the 19th century was [[Georg Hackenschmidt]] born in [[Dorpat]], [[Russian Empire]], and nicknamed "The Russian Lion." Hackenschmidt in 1898 at the age of 21 and with 15 months of training defeated the experienced Paul Pons in a match in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia. In 1900, he won professional tournaments in Moscow and St. Petersburg and a series of international tournaments after that. After defeating Tom Jenkins (from the United States) in both freestyle and Greco-Roman matches in England, Georg Hackenschmidt wrestled exclusively freestyle in order to compete better against English, Australian, and American opponents. Winning more than 2,000 victories in Greco-Roman and freestyle, Hackenschmidt served as the [[physical education]] adviser to the [[House of Lords]] after his retirement.&lt;ref name=PoliakoffGR1195&gt;"Wrestling, Greco-Roman" by Michael B. Poliakoff from ''Encyclopedia of World Sport: From Ancient Times to the Present'', Vol. 3, p. 1195, eds. David Levinson and Karen Christensen (Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional matches in Greco-Roman wrestling were known for their great brutality. Body slams, choke-holds, and head-butting was allowed, and even caustic substances were used to weaken the opponent. 
By the end of the 19th century, gouging with the nails, punching, and violently slamming the arms together around the opponent's stomach were forbidden. Greco-Roman matches were also famous for their length. Professionally, it was not uncommon for there to be matches lasting two or three hours. 
William Muldoon's bout with [[Clarence Whistler]] at the Terrace Garden Theater in New York lasted eight hours before ending in a draw. Even in the 1912 Olympics, a match between [[Anders Ahlgren]] of Sweden and [[Ivar Boehling]] of Finland lasted for nine hours before a draw was called and both wrestlers awarded the silver medal. The [[United World Wrestling|International Amateur Wrestling Federation (IAWF)]] took over the regulation of Greco-Roman wrestling in 1921. Since then matches have been dramatically cut short, and today all movements that put the life or limb of the wrestler in jeopardy are forbidden.&lt;ref name="PoliakoffGR1196"&gt;"Wrestling, Greco-Roman" by Michael B. Poliakoff from ''Encyclopedia of World Sport: From Ancient Times to the Present'', Vol. 3, p. 1196, eds. David Levinson and Karen Christensen (Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

In Olympic competition, countries of the former Soviet Union, [[Bulgaria]], Turkey, [[South Korea]], [[Romania]], Japan, Sweden, and Finland have had great success. [[Carl Westergren]] of Sweden won three Greco-Roman gold medals in 1920, 1924, and 1932, and was the first Greco-Roman wrestler to do so. [[Alexander Karelin]] did the same in 1988, 1992, and 1996. Ivar Johansson of Sweden won gold medals in Greco-Roman in 1932 and 1936 and also a gold medal in freestyle in 1932. The United States Olympic delegation (exclusively wrestling freestyle before) first entered Greco-Roman wrestling in 1952 and has taken three gold medals, won by [[Steve Fraser]] and [[Jeff Blatnick|Jeffrey Blatnick]] in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games, and by [[Rulon Gardner]] at the 2000 Olympic Games in [[Sydney]], Australia.&lt;ref name="PoliakoffGR1195" /&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Wrestlers after weigh-in may only wrestle in their own weight class. Wrestlers in the senior age category may wrestle up a weight class except for the heavyweight division (which starts at a weight more than 96&amp;nbsp;kg for the men).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Different nations may have different weight classes and different age categories for their levels of Greco-Roman competition.

==Structure of the tournament==
A typical international wrestling tournament takes place by direct elimination with an ideal number of wrestlers (4, 8, 16, 32, 64, etc.) in each weight class and age category competing for placement. The competition in each weight class takes place in one day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title = International Wrestling Rules: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling
  | work = p. 14
  | publisher = FILA
  | date = 2006-12-01
  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf
  | doi =
  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The day before the wrestling in a scheduled weight class and age category takes place, all the applicable wrestlers are examined by a physician and weighed-in. Each wrestler after being weighed on the scale then draws a token randomly that gives a certain number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title = International Wrestling Rules!: Greco-Roman Wrestling, Freestyle Wrestling, Women's Wrestling
  | work = pp. 19-20
  | publisher = FILA

  | url = http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf
  | doi =
  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

If an ideal number is not reached to begin elimination rounds, a '''qualification round''' will take place to eliminate the excess number of wrestlers. For example, 22 wrestlers may weigh-in over the ideal number of 16 wrestlers. The six wrestlers who drew the highest numbers after 16 and the six wrestlers who drew the six numbers immediately before 17 would then wrestle in six matches in the qualification round. The winners of those matches would then go on to the elimination round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | doi =
  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the "elimination round", the ideal number of wrestlers then pair off and compete in matches until two victors emerge who will compete in the finals for first and second place. All of the wrestlers who lost to the two finals then have the chance to wrestle in a "[[repechage]] round". The repechage round begins with the wrestlers who lost to the two finalists at the lowest level of competition in the elimination round. The matches are paired off by the wrestlers who lost to one finalist and the wrestlers who lost to the other. The two wrestlers who win after every level of competition are the victors of the repechage round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | doi =
  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In all rounds of the tournament, the wrestlers compete in matches paired off in the order of the numbers they drew after the weigh-in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

After the finals match, the awards ceremony will take place. The first place and second place wrestlers will receive a gold and silver medal, respectively. (At the FILA World Championships, the first place wrestler will receive the World Championship Belt.) The two repechage round winners will each be awarded third place with a bronze medal. The two wrestlers who lost in the finals for the third place are awarded fifth place. From seventh place down, the wrestlers are ranked according to the classification points earned for their victories or losses. If there is a tie among wrestlers for classification points, the ranking is determined in this order from the highest to the lowest:
* Most victories earned by fall
* Most matches won by technical superiority
* Most periods won by technical superiority
* Most technical points scored in the tournament
* Least technical points scored in the tournament
Wrestlers who remained tied after that will be awarded placements ''ex aequo''. Wrestlers classified from the fifth to the 10th place will receive a special diploma. The wrestling tournaments in the [[Olympic Games]] and the Senior and Junior World Championships are designed to take place over three days on three mats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Layout of the mat==
The match takes place on a thick rubber circular mat that is shock-absorbing to ensure safety. For the Olympic Games, all World Championships, and World Cups, the mat has to be new. The main wrestling area has a nine-meter diameter and is surrounded by a 1.5 meter border of the same thickness known as the "protection area". Inside the nine meter in diameter circle is a red band of one meter in width that is on the outer edge of the circle and is known as the "red zone". The red zone is used to help indicate passivity on the part of a wrestler; thus, it is also known as the "passivity zone". Inside the red zone is the "central wrestling area" which is seven meters in diameter. In the middle of the central wrestling area is the "central circle", which is one meter in diameter. The central circle is surrounded by a band 10 centimeters wide and is divided in half by a red line eight centimeters in width. The diagonally opposite corners of the mat are marked with the wrestlers' colors, red and blue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | doi =
  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

For competition in the Olympic Games, the World Championships, and the Continental Championships, the mat is installed on a platform no greater than 1.1 meters in height. If the mat lies on a podium and the protection margin (covering and free space around the mat) does not reach two meters, then the sides of the podium are covered with 45° (degree) inclined panels. In all cases, the color of the protection area is different from the color of the mat.&lt;ref name=FILAIWR9&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment==
* A "[[Wrestling singlet|singlet]]" is a one-piece wrestling garment made of [[spandex]] that should provide a tight and comfortable fit for the wrestler. It is made from [[nylon]] or [[lycra]] and prevents an opponent from using anything on the wrestler as leverage. One wrestler usually competes in a red singlet and the other in a blue singlet.&lt;ref name="FILAIWR9" /&gt;
* A special pair of "[[Wrestling shoes|shoes]]" is worn by the wrestler to increase his mobility and flexibility. Wrestling shoes are light and flexible in order to provide maximum comfort and movement. Usually made with rubber soles, they help give the wrestler's feet a better grip on the mat.&lt;ref name=FILAIWR10&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
* A "handkerchief", also called a "bloodrag", is carried in the singlet. In the event of bleeding, the wrestler will remove the cloth from his singlet and attempt to stop the bleeding or clean up any bodily fluids that may have gotten onto the mat.&lt;ref name="FILAIWR9" /&gt;

==The match==
[[Image:GrecoRomanWrestling3.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Throws of grand amplitude, such as is seen here, can win entire periods in Greco-Roman wrestling.]]
A match is a competition between two individual wrestlers of the same weight class. In Greco-Roman wrestling, a jury (or team) of three officials ([[referee]]s) is used. The referee controls the action in the center, blowing the whistle to start and stop the action, and supervises the scoring of holds and infractions. The judge sits at the side of the mat, keeps score, and occasionally gives his approval when needed by the referee for various decisions. The mat chairman sits at the scoring table, keeps time, is responsible for declaring technical superiority, and supervises the work of the referee and judge. To call a fall, two of the three officials must agree (usually, the referee and either the judge or the mat chairman).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Period format===
In Greco-Roman and freestyle, the format is now two three-minute periods. Before each match, each wrestler's name is called, and the wrestler takes his place at the corner of the mat assigned to his color. The referee then calls them to his side at the center of the mat, shakes hands with them, inspects their apparel, and checks for any perspiration, oily or greasy substances, and any other infractions. The two wrestlers then greet each other, shake hands, and the referee blows his whistle to start the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

A wrestler wins the match when he has won two out of three periods. For example, if one competitor were to win the first period 1-0 and the second period 1-0, the match would be over. However, if the other competitor were to win the second period, then a third and deciding period would result. Only a fall, injury default, or disqualification terminates the match; all other modes of victory result only in period termination. One side effect of this format is that it is possible for the losing wrestler to outscore the winner. For example, periods may be scored 3-2, 0-4, 1-0, leading to a total score of 4-6 but a win for the wrestler scoring fewer points.&lt;ref name=FILAIWR27,30&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Each Greco-Roman period is broken up into a phase for wrestling from the neutral position and a maximum of two par terre (ground wrestling) phases. During the wrestling phase from the neutral position, both wrestlers compete for takedowns and points for 60 seconds as usual. At the end of the first minute, in general, the wrestler who has scored the most points will receive the advantage in an Olympic lift from an open par terre position on the other wrestler. This position is known as "the Clinch". If neither wrestler at this point has any points, the referee will toss a colored disk, with a red-colored side and a blue-colored side. The wrestler who won the colored disk toss will receive the advantage in the Olympic lift.

The wrestler who lost the colored disk toss then places his hands and knees in the center circle, with the hands and knees at least 20 centimeters apart and the distance between the hands a maximum of 30 centimeters. The arms of that wrestler would be stretched out, the feet would not be crossed, and the thighs would be stretched out forming a 90-degree angle with the mat. The wrestler who won the colored disk toss would then be allowed to step beside the wrestler on the bottom, not touching him with his legs. If the wrestler who won the colored disk toss wished, he could place one knee on the mat. The top wrestler would then wrap his hands and arms around the bottom wrestler's waist and execute the Olympic lift (called an upside-down belt hold) at the beginning of the first 30 seconds. The bottom wrestler could then attempt to defend himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of first thirty seconds, the clinch position is reversed with the other wrestler receiving the Olympic lift, and the period continuing for the remaining 30 seconds. The period is decided by who accumulated the most points during both standing and ground phases. During each ground phase, if the top wrestler cannot score, the other wrestler is awarded one point. In the case of no scoring moves being executed during either ground phase the score will be 1-1, and in this case generally the wrestler to score last will be awarded the period.&lt;ref name=FILAIWR4446&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

When the period (or match) has concluded, the referee stands at the center of the mat facing the officials' table. Both wrestlers then come, shake hands, and stand on either side of the referee to await the decision. The referee then proclaims the winner by raising the winner's hand. At the end of the match, each wrestler then shakes hands with the referee and returns to shake hands with his opponent's coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Match scoring===
In Greco-Roman wrestling, as well as in freestyle wrestling, points are awarded mostly on the basis of explosive action and risk. For example, when one wrestler performs a grand amplitude throw that brings his opponent into the danger position, he is awarded the greatest number of points that can be scored in one instance. Also, a wrestler who takes the risk to briefly roll on the mat (with his shoulders in contact with the mat) could give a certain number of points to his opponent. Scoring can be accomplished in the following ways:
* '''Takedown''' (2 to 5 points): A wrestler is awarded points for a takedown when the wrestler gains control over his opponent on the mat from a neutral position (when the wrestler is on his feet). At least three points of contact have to be controlled on the mat (e.g. two arms and one knee; two knees and one arm or the head; or two arms and the head).&lt;ref name=FILAIWR3637&gt;{{cite web

  | doi =
  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
::(5 points) - Five points are awarded for a takedown brought about by a throw of grand amplitude (a throw in which a wrestler brings his opponent off of the mat and controls him so that his feet go directly above his head) either from the standing or ''par terre'' position into a direct and immediate danger position.&lt;ref name=FILAIWR37&gt;{{cite web

  | doi =
  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
::(4 points) - Generally, four points are awarded for a takedown brought about by a grand amplitude throw that does not bring his opponent in a direct and immediate danger position or for a takedown in which a wrestler's opponent is taken from his feet or his stomach to his back or side (a throw of short amplitude) so that he is in the danger position.&lt;ref name="FILAIWR37" /&gt;
::(2 point) - Two points are awarded for a takedown brought about by a wrestler taking his opponent from his feet to his stomach or side such that his back or shoulders are not exposed to the mat.&lt;ref name=FILAIWR36&gt;{{cite web

  | doi =
  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Reversal''' (1 point): A wrestler is awarded one point for a reversal when the wrestler gains control over his opponent from a defensive position (when the wrestler is being controlled by his opponent).&lt;ref name="FILAIWR36" /&gt;
* '''Exposure''' also called the "Danger Position" (2 or 3 points): A wrestler is awarded points for exposure when the wrestler exposes his opponent's back to the mat for several seconds. Points for exposure are also awarded if a wrestler's back is to the mat but the wrestler is not pinned. Criteria for exposure or the danger position is met when 1) a wrestler's opponent is in a bridge position to avoid being pinned, 2) a wrestler's opponent is on one or both elbows with his back to the mat and avoids getting pinned, 3) a wrestler holds one of his opponent's shoulders to the mat and the other shoulder at an acute angle (less than 90 degrees), 4) a wrestler's opponent is in an "instantaneous fall" position (where both of his shoulders are on the mat for less than one second), or 5) the wrestler's opponent rolls on his shoulders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; A wrestler in the danger position allows his opponent to score two points. An additional "hold-down point" may be earned by maintaining the exposure continuously for five seconds.&lt;ref name="FILAIWR3637" /&gt;
* '''Penalty''' (1 or 2 points): Under the 2004–2005 changes to the international styles, a wrestler whose opponent takes an injury time-out receives one point unless the injured wrestler is bleeding. Other infractions (e.g. fleeing a hold or the mat, striking the opponent, acting with brutality or intent to injure, and using illegal holds) are penalized by an award of either one or two points, a "caution", and a choice of position to the opponent.&lt;ref name="FILAIWR3637" /&gt;
* '''Out-of-Bounds''' (1 point): Whenever a wrestler places his foot in the protection area, the match is stopped, and one point is awarded to his opponent.&lt;ref name="FILAIWR36" /&gt;

Classification points are also awarded in an international wrestling tournament, which give most points to the winner and in some cases, one point to the loser depending on the outcome of the match and how the victory was attained. For example, a victory by fall would give the winner five classification points and the loser no points, while a match won by technical superiority with the loser scoring technical points would award three points to the winner and one point to loser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The full determinations for scoring are found [http://www.fila-wrestling.com/images/documents/lutte/wr230107.pdf on pages 34 to 40 of the ''FILA International Wrestling Rules''].

==Victory conditions==
[[Image:GrecoRomanWrestling1.jpg|thumb|200px|In Greco-Roman wrestling, the prohibition on the use of the legs in offense and defense often means that points are scored for many throws of grand amplitude. Lifting skills are essential, as seen here.]]
A match can be won in the following ways:
* '''Win by fall''': The object of the wrestling match is to attain victory by what is known as the fall. A fall, also known as a [[pin (amateur wrestling)|pin]], occurs when one wrestler holds both of his opponents' shoulders on the mat simultaneously. In Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling, the two shoulders of the defensive wrestler must be held long enough for the referee to "observe the total control of the fall" (usually ranging from one half-second to about one or two seconds). Then either the judge or the mat chairman concurs with the referee that a fall is made; if the referee does not indicate a fall, and the fall is valid, the judge and the mat chairman can concur together and announce the fall. A fall ends the match entirely regardless of when it occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | doi =
  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, for the Kids freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling division (wrestlers ages 8 to 14) in competitions sponsored by [[USA Wrestling]], it is specified that a fall must be held for two seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | url = http://www.themat.com/forms/Rulebook.pdf
  | doi =
  | accessdate = 2009-03-19 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Win by technical superiority''' (also called "[[technical fall]]"):  If a fall is not secured to end the match, a wrestler can win a period simply by points. If one wrestler gains an eight-point lead over his opponent at any break in continuous action, he is declared the winner of the match by technical superiority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | doi =
  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Win by decision''': If neither wrestler achieves either a fall or technical superiority, the wrestler who scored more points during the match is declared the winner. If the score is tied, the winner is determined by certain criteria. First, the number of cautions given to each wrestler for penalties; next, the value of points gained (that is, whether a wrestler gained points based on a two-, four-, or five-point move); and finally, the last scored technical point are taken into account to determine the winner. Generally, the wrestler who scored the last technical point will be awarded the period.&lt;ref name="FILAIWR4446"/&gt;
* '''Win by default''': If one wrestler is unable to continue participating for any reason, or fails to show up on the mat after his name was called three times before the match begins, his opponent is declared the winner of the match by default, forfeit, or withdrawal as the case may be.&lt;ref name="FILAIWR27,30" /&gt;
* '''Win by injury''': If one wrestler is injured and unable to continue, the other wrestler is declared the winner. This is also referred to as a "medical forfeit" or "injury default". The term also encompasses situations where wrestlers become ill, take too many injury time-outs, or bleed uncontrollably. In the event a wrestler is injured by his opponent's illegal maneuver and cannot continue, the wrestler at fault is disqualified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | doi =
  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Win by disqualification''': If a wrestler is assessed three "cautions" for breaking the rules, he is disqualified. Under other circumstances, such as flagrant brutality or gross disrepect for officials, the match will be ended immediately and the offending wrestler ejected from the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Team scoring in tournaments===
In an international wrestling tournament, teams enter one wrestler at each weight class and score points based on the individual performances. For example, if a wrestler at the 60&amp;nbsp;kg weight class finishes in first place, then his team will receive 10 points. If he were to finish in tenth place, then the team would only receive one. At the end of the tournament, each team's score is tallied, and the teams are then placed first, second, third, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | doi =
  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Team competition===
A '''team competition''' or '''dual meet''' is a meeting between (typically two) teams in which individual wrestlers at a given weight class compete against each other. A team receives one point for each victory in a weight class regardless of the outcome. The team that scores the most points at the end of the matches wins the team competition. If there are two sets of competitions with one team winning the ''home'' competition and one winning the ''away'' competition, a third competition may take place to determine the winner for ranking purposes, or the ranking may take place by assessing in order: 1) the most victories by adding the points of the two matches; 2) the most points by fall, default, forfeit, or disqualification; 3) the most matches won by technical superiority; 4) the most periods won by technical superiority; 5) the most technical points won in all the competition; 6) the least technical points won in all the competition. This works similarly when more than two teams are involved in this predicament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Hockey socks''' are ankle-to-thigh garments worn over protective gear by [[ice hockey]] players. They are [[form-fitting]], and traditionally made of a cotton or synthetic rib-knit fabric. Experiments have been made with a lightweight fabric "sock," of material similar to that used in [[hockey jersey]]s, and most recently (mid-2000s) with a streamlined lightweight "sock" used by the [[United States at the Olympics|U.S. Olympic]] and other international teams. Hockey socks should not be confused with ''hockey skate socks'' which are thin, traditional style socks worn over the foot (inside the [[hockey skate|skate]]).
[[Image:Hockey socks.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Pictured as worn, players make their way from the locker room to the rink.&lt;/center&gt;]]
They are held up either by a [[Garter_(stockings)#In ice hockey|garter]] (old style) or attached to undershorts with [[Velcro]] tabs. Players usually keep their socks inside the upper ankle area of their skates.

[[File:Travis Zajac wearing tape over hockey socks (13900524126).jpg|thumb|right|Tape is often used to hold the socks in-place]]
Athletic tape is generally used below the knee to hold the sock in place, and sometimes at the ankle as well.

Hockey socks, along with a [[hockey jersey|jersey]], are considered part of a team [[uniform#Sports|uniform]] under [[USA Hockey|USA Hockey's]] rule 304(a) (2005-06 season) and are required as coverage for protective equipment ([[shinguards]]). Organized teams wear hockey socks in designated team [[Away colours|colors]], complementary to the team jersey.

An '''isometric exercise tool''' is a device used to exercise most body parts including the [[wrist]] and is often used as part of [[physical therapy]] or in order to build muscle strength in a low impact manner. Devices can range in size from large bulky machines used by physicians to small hand-held devices that can be used by an individual. Isometric devices have been used for centuries. The first devices did not display the users' output; nowadays there are devices that can digitally output the users force. Before that some devices used an analog format.

==How it works==
Isometric exercise tools perform exercises or strength test using static contraction of a muscle without any visible movement in the angle of the joint. This is reflected in the name; the term "isometric" combines the prefix "iso" (same) with "metric" (distance), meaning that in these exercises the length of the muscle does not change,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sport-fitness-advisor.com/isometric-exercises.html Article on static strength training]&lt;/ref&gt;  as compared to ''isotonic contractions'' ("tonos" means "tension" in Greek) in which the contraction strength does not change but the joint angle does. New isometric exercise tools often used force gauges and a micro processor and then output the force onto an LCD screen or store the information later to be downloaded onto a computer.

==Medical uses==
Isometric exercises can also be used at the bedside to differentiate various [[heart murmur]]s; the murmur of [[mitral regurgitation]] gets louder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://pediatrics.uchicago.edu/chiefs/ClinicCurriculum/documents/WCEvaluationofMurmursintheClinicSetting.pdf | title = Evaluation of Cardiac Murmurs in the Clinic Setting | publisher = University of Chicago | accessdate = 2008-01-10 | last = Ching | first = W }}&lt;/ref&gt; as compared to the quieter murmur of [[aortic stenosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cassidy J, Aronow WS, Prakash R |title=The effect of isometric exercise on the systolic murmur of patients with idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis |journal=Chest |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=395–7 |year=1975 |pmid=1168115 |doi=10.1378/chest.67.4.395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with dynamic exercises==
Isometric exercises have some differences in training effect as compared to dynamic exercises. While isometric training increases strength at the specific joint angles of the exercises performed and additional joint angles to a lesser extent, dynamic exercises increase strength throughout the full [[range of motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lindh M |title=Increase of muscle strength from isometric quadriceps exercises at different knee angles |journal=Scand J Rehabil Med |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=33–6 |year=1979 |pmid=419396 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking however, people who train isometrically don't train through a full range of motion as the strength gained at the training joint angle is where they require it. While dynamic exercises are slightly better than isometric exercises at enhancing the twitch force of a muscle, isometrics are significantly better than dynamic exercises at increasing maximal strength at the joint angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Duchateau J, Hainaut K |title=Isometric or dynamic training: differential effects on mechanical properties of a human muscle |journal=Journal of Applied Physiology |volume=56 |issue=2 |pages=296–301 |year=1984 |pmid=6706740 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Flexibility may be increased when isometrics are performed at joint range of motion extremes.  These isometric contractions recruit muscle fibers that are often neglected in some dynamic exercises.  For example, gymnasts are extremely strong at great ranges of motion through the practice of isometric holds.

[[File:Judo newaza.jpg|thumb|These two judoka are wearing judogi]]
'''''Judogi''''' (柔道着 or 柔道衣) is the formal [[Japanese language|Japanese]] name for the traditional uniform used for [[Judo]] practice and competition.

A judogi is somewhat similar to a [[karategi]] (空手着 or 空手衣, '''[[Karate]] uniform''') as it shares a common origin. [[Jigoro Kano]] derived the original Judogi from the [[Kimono]] and other Japanese garments around the turn of the 20th century, and, as such, the judogi was the first modern martial-arts-training uniform.  Over the years, the sleeves and pants have been lengthened, the material and fit have changed, the traditional unbleached cotton is now a bleached white, and blue Judogi have become available; nevertheless, the uniform is still very close to that used 100 years ago. Other martial arts, notably [[Karate]], later adopted the style of training uniform that is used in Judo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A judogi comprises three parts that are usually cut from different fabrics: a very heavy jacket (uwagi), lighter canvas pants (shitabaki), and a cotton  belt (obi).  Though similar to the shorter styles of kimono, an uwagi will invariably be made from heavy-weight [[cotton]] or cotton blend.  All but the cheapest and lightest uwagi are cut from woven cotton, similar to, but much more tightly woven than, terrycloth. More expensive competition and hand-made judogi will often weigh several kilograms when finished. Due to the nature of judo practice, they commonly have heavier stitching and double-layered knee patches to provide durability. The obi's different colors denote the different ranks in judo.

[[File:Judo orange belt (Brusselsshrek).JPG|thumb|Close up view of a judogi]]
In competition, judogi sizes and fit are strictly defined by the IJF rules of judo (see below).  These rules define sleeve and pant length as well as the looseness of the fit; in competition, the referee can disqualify a competitor for wearing an ill-fitting judogi that may be used for advantage. In addition, various organizations and events oversee such matters as the attachment of commercial and team/national patches and competitors' names. All competitive judogi must be clean and free of holes, tears, or excessive wear.

In official national or international competition only white or blue judogi are allowed. Competitors must have available both colors because one contestant in each match is designated to wear a blue gi while the other wears a white gi. Most judo classes will permit students to wear either color, although white is the traditional color that is often preferred and white fits in better with the traditions of judo and Japanese culture. Less common colors, including red and black, can be found in less formal or specialized situations.

The left side of the gi must cross over the right one.

== Judogi weights ==
Judogi are sold in many thicknesses, which can be generally grouped together in the two classes: single-weave and [[Double weave|double-weave]]. Single-weave judogi are thinner and weigh less (upper jacket textile fabric weight usually 300–550&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The thinner judogi are less durable, although some judoka (judo practitioners) may prefer them for long practices as they are less likely to foster overheating. Double-weave judogi are thicker and weigh more (fabric weight usually 650–1050&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). They are harder to grab than single-weave gis, which is considered an advantage in competition. Double-weave gis shrink less and those of high quality are often sold entirely pre-shrunk, this is important to know when comparing the fit of the gi. Double-weave gis generally cost considerably more than single-weave gis of comparable quality.

Pants by themselves should not be classified as single-weave or double-weave as the name only refers to the weaving style used for the upper section of the jacket. However, pants sold together with double-weave jackets will also tend to be heavier than normal due to stronger fabric or large reinforced sections.

Double-weave jackets designed for competition usually display a prominent seam that runs down the back of the jacket, joining two halves of fabric. Starting in the late nineties, some manufacturers made this overlapping part very wide, in effect doubling the fabric thickness for a large section of the back. This blocked the opponent from gripping there, which in 2005 caused the [[International Judo Federation]] to ban fighting in international competitions using a judogi with back seam area wider than 3&amp;nbsp;cm (a little more than one inch). Wider designs could still be permitted in local competitions depending on national rules. Single-weave jackets usually have no back seam, or a narrow one which only joins two fabric sections without interfering with grips.

He is wearing a white kirtka with a blue plastron and red [[epaulette]]s.]]
A '''kurtka''' ({{Lang|ru|куртка}}) is the generic word for a [[jacket]] in a number of European languages, most notably in [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Russian language|Russian]].

==Etymology==
The word itself is a Slavic diminutive of the original Hungarian word ''kurta'', which in turn was derived of the Latin word ''curtus'', "excurtus", meaning short (see Alejandro Cioranescu: Diccionario Etimologico Rumano).

==Military uniforms==
In terms of [[military uniform]]s, the kurtka was a type of close fitting [[double breasted]] jacket, cut to the waist and often worn with a plastron, a contrasting-coloured panel of cloth covering the chest. It was worn by [[lancer]]s and [[uhlan]]s, a type of [[light cavalry]] which had its origins in the [[Lipka Tatars]] who served the kings of [[Poland]], but were widely copied by the armies of many western nations from the start of the [[19th century]] along with their distinctive style of dress.

The lancer's kurtka developed from a jacket called a ''kontusz'', which during the late [[18th century]] became shortened into the kurtka.&lt;ref&gt;Rospond, Vincent W. (2013), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=66e6CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=%22kurtka%22+lancer+uniform&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZ99-xp8bNAhWhF8AKHRXJCr0Q6AEIPDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=%22kurtka%22%20lancer%20uniform&amp;f=false ''Polish Armies of the Partitions 1770–94''], Osprey Publishing, {{ISBN|978-1-84908855-8}} (p. 15)&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Damba radnaev.jpg|thumb|right|Wearing a blue kirtka, Damba Radnaev was the [[World Sambo Championships|World Sambo Champion]] in 2015.]]
==Martial arts==
In addition to the general meaning of "jacket", the word ''kurtka'' refers to the garment normally worn by [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]] practitioners, similar to the [[keikogi]] in style and function, although it is tighter fitting and has epaulettes and belt loops.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Thomas A. (editor) 2001, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=v32oHSE5t6cC&amp;pg=PA512&amp;dq=%22kurtka%22+martial+art&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwitvtTBr8bNAhUlKMAKHYnqC3sQ6AEIMzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22kurtka%22%20martial%20art&amp;f=false ''Martial Arts of the World: An Encyclopedia - Volume One: A-Q''], ABC-CLIO Inc. {{ISBN|1-57607-150-2}} (p. 512)&lt;/ref&gt; A kurtka should be made of canvas or other heavy material, should be tight-fitting, should not extend more than eight inches below the belt (roughly equal to the bottom of the sleeve) and the sleeves must be long enough to cover the arms to the wrists, and wide enough at the end to fit the wrist and four fingers.

==Association football==
{{Main|Association football}}
{{See also| National Football League|American Football League|Canadian Football League}}

[[Rugby football]] in Canada had its origins in the early 1860s, and over time, a unique code of football known as [[Canadian football]] developed. Both the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL), the sport's top professional league, and [[Football Canada]], the governing body for amateur play, trace their roots to 1882 and the founding of the Canadian Rugby Football Union (later reorganized as the Canadian Rugby Union). In 1909, the [[Grey Cup]] was donated by the then [[Governor General of Canada]] [[Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey]], to recognize the top amateur rugby football team in Canada. From the 1930s to the 1950s, the two senior leagues of the CRU (the [[Canadian Football League East Division|Interprovincial Rugby Football Union]] and the [[Canadian Football League West Division|Western Interprovincial Football Union]]) gradually evolved from amateur to professional leagues, and found they had less and less in common with the amateur leagues, and consequently in 1956 formed a new umbrella organization, the Canadian Football Council. In 1958, the CFC left the CRU altogether and was renamed the Canadian Football League. By this time, teams from the amateur [[Ontario Rugby Football Union]] had stopped challenging for the Grey Cup, and ever since, it has been exclusively awarded to CFL teams. Since 1965, [[CIS football|university teams]] have competed for the [[Vanier Cup]].&lt;ref name="Football Canada timeline"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.footballcanada.com/history_timeline.asp |title=Canadian Football Timelines (1860 – present) |accessdate=2006-12-23 |publisher=[[Football Canada]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228064050/http://www.footballcanada.com/history_timeline.asp |archivedate=2007-02-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australian rules football==

{{Main|Australian rules football}}


Unlike other sports, Australian rules football has not resisted becoming a professional sport.

Although the sport began as amateur competition, the [[Australian Football League]] is an elite professional league and has been for nearly 80 years since its initial formation as the Victorian Football Association and then the Victorian Football League in 1897. The league changed its name to the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) in 1990 amid the increasing professionalism and national expansion of the game.

The game was invented in the [[United States]] in the 1890s, in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]. The first professional basketball leagues emerged in the 1920s in the [[United States]].  Prominent among these were the [[American Basketball League (1925-1955)|American Basketball League]], which formed in 1925, and the [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]], which was launched in 1937 by General Electric, Firestone and Goodyear as a way to improve their national profile.&lt;ref name="Steve Dimitry"&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Arena/6925/abl1.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+07:07:30 "Steve Dimitry's Extinct Sports Leagues."]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1946 the [[Basketball Association of America]] was founded by the owners of major sports arenas, particularly the [[Madison Square Garden]]. The BAA later merged with the NBL in 1949 to become the [[National Basketball Association]], the preeminent league in the world with 29 teams in the United States and one in Canada.  The [[American Basketball Association]], founded in 1967, subsequently joined the NBA in the 1976 [[ABA-NBA merger]].

The second-oldest professional basketball league in the world is the [[Philippine Basketball Association]]. The PBA was long considered to be the best league in [[Asia]], but the [[Chinese Basketball Association]] has grown tremendously in recent years. The league was born on April 9, 1975 at the [[Araneta Coliseum]], [[Cubao]], [[Quezon City]], [[Philippines]].

Outside of the NBA, the top professional leagues in the world are those of [[FIBA Europe]]. According to the [[European national basketball league rankings|official league rankings]] produced by [[Euroleague Basketball (company)|Euroleague Basketball]], the body that conducts the continent-wide [[Euroleague Basketball|Euroleague]], the top five national domestic leagues on the continent (from 1 to 5) are those [[Liga ACB]] (Spain), the [[Russian Professional Basketball League]], the [[Greek Basket League]], [[Lega Basket Serie A]] (Italy), and the [[Turkish Basketball League]].

European basketball is also characterized by its long established and well-developed transnational club competitions, most notably the Euroleague, which features top clubs from as many as 18 different domestic leagues. Two other continental club competitions, the [[ULEB Eurocup]] and [[EuroChallenge]], are also conducted annually. Europe also has transnational regional leagues, such as the [[Liga ABA]] (Adriatic League, formerly [[Yugoslavian Basketball League|Yugoslavian League]]), and [[Baltic Basketball League]] (originally limited to the Baltic states, now also including Kazakhstan).

{{Main|History of English amateur cricket}}
{{See also|World Series Cricket|County cricket}}

Cricket at the highest level has developed into a fully professional international sport from which leading players can earn a large income. However professionalism has a long history in English cricket. The first professionals had appeared by the first half of the eighteenth century, when heavy gambling on the game encouraged wealthy patrons to draft the best players into their teams. They would often offer these players full-time employment as gardeners or gamekeepers on their estates. In the second half of the century, the famous Hambledon Club paid its players match fees.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

In the middle of the nineteenth century William Clarke's All-England Eleven was a highly successful all-professional venture which did much to popularise the game. The earliest overseas tours were also all-professional affairs.

In the early 21st century cricket is as lucrative as some other sports, and domestic cricketers typically earn several times the average salary in their country. Regular members of the [[England cricket team|English cricket team]] earn several hundred thousand [[pound sterling|pounds]] a year. However, the highest paid cricketers in the world are the star members of the [[Australia national cricket team|Australian cricket team]] or the [[India national cricket team|Indian cricket team]] who make most of their income from endorsement contracts.

==Ice hockey==
{{Main|Professional ice hockey}}
It is played with two teams, while 5 skaters and 1 goalie are allowed on the ice at a time. In NHL rules, the periods are 20 minutes long. There are three periods.

The 64-member governing body is the International Ice Hockey Federation, (IIHF). Ice hockey has been played at the Winter Olympics since 1924, and was in the 1920 Summer Olympics. North America's [[National Hockey League]] is the strongest professional ice hockey league, drawing top ice hockey players from around the globe. The NHL rules are slightly different from those used in Olympic hockey.

Ice hockey sticks are long L-shaped sticks made of wood, graphite, or composites with a blade at the bottom that can lie flat on the playing surface when the stick is held upright and can curve either way as to help a left- or right-handed player gain an advantage.

There are early representations and reports of hockey-type games being played on ice in the Netherlands, and reports from Canada from the beginning of the nineteenth century, but the modern game was initially organized by students at McGill University, Montreal in 1875 and, by two years later, codified the first set of ice hockey rules and organized the first teams.

==Lacrosse==
{{Main|Lacrosse}}
Lacrosse is played mainly in [[North America]], however, countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia have small lacrosse leagues. It has also expanded into both Europe and Asia, with the latter forming the Asia Pacific Lacrosse Union (APLU) in May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://filacrosse.com/fil-welcomes-the-aplu/|title=Asia Pacific Lacrosse Union|accessdate=2016-02-26|publisher=[[Federation of International Lacrosse]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States currently has two top-level professional lacrosse leagues in operation, [[Major League Lacrosse]] and the [[National Lacrosse League]].

==Rugby league==
{{See also|History of rugby league|Football}}

Rugby league came into existence due to the very issue of professionalism. Rugby football split into 'union' and 'league' over the issue of payment to player. Rugby league favoured payments and has thus been a professional sport since its [[1895–96 Northern Rugby Football Union season|beginnings in 1895]], when 22 clubs based in northern England [[History of rugby league#The schism in England|split]] from the more amateur-minded [[Rugby Football Union]]. The officially amateur RFU had previously brought charges of professionalism against some clubs for their use of "broken time" payments to compensate players for missing work due to matches or injuries received whilst playing. On August 29, 1895 in a meeting at the [[George Hotel, Huddersfield]], the clubs decided to break away and form the Northern Rugby Union, which later would become the [[Rugby Football League]]. The rules of rugby league were gradually changed so that now it and rugby union are distinctly different games, however rugby union has since turned professional as well. On 17 December 1967 the first professional Sunday matches of rugby league were played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Rugby union ==

{{See also|History of rugby union|Football}}

Rugby union continued with its amateur ideals past the schism between union and league and throughout much of the 20th century. This position changed in 1995. The threat of big payments from professional rugby league clubs in countries where rugby league had a significant following was becoming too great. A committee conclusion decided that the only way to end this threat, the hypocrisy of [[Shamateurism]] and keep control of rugby union was to make the sport professional. On August 26, 1995 the International Rugby Board declared rugby union an "open" game and thus removed all restrictions on payments or benefits to those connected with the game.

The PBR is different from the classic rodeo as it consists of only bull riding. It was founded in 1992 because a group of bull riders decided that their sport should be separated from the classic rodeo and could, as it was easily the most popular event. Riders and bulls are judged on a 50-point scale. Riders are only given a score if they stay on for the mandatory 8 seconds, while bull scores are given regardless of what the rider does.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13474">The '''long-term complications of standing''' are the conditions that may arise after prolonged time in a standing or upright position including standing, walking or running. Many of the complications come from prolonged standing (more the 60% of a work day) that is repeated several times a week. There are many different jobs that require prolonged standing. These included: "retail staff, Baristas, bartenders, assembly line workers, security staff, engineers, catering staff, library assistants, hair stylists and laboratory technicians."&lt;ref name="safeworkers.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Watson|first1=Kevin|title=MSc|url=http://www.safeworkers.co.uk/standing-for-long-periods.html|website=Standing for Long Periods|accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornell university has calculated that "Standing requires ~20% more energy than sitting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cornell University|title=Sitting and Standing at Work|url=http://ergo.human.cornell.edu/CUESitStand.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
There are no exact measures of how prevalent the complications are. However, European studies report that between one third and one half of all workers spend at least four hours per [[Working time]] (for an average workday of eight hours) standing or walking.&lt;ref name=whsc&gt;[http://www.whsc.on.ca/Files/Resources/Hazard-Resource-Lines/Prolonged-Standing-WHSC-Resource-Line Prolonged Standing: taking the load off], Version 2.0. From: Workers Health and Safety Center.&lt;/ref&gt; One estimate from the United Kingdom stated that over 11 million people stand for long periods of time without rest.&lt;ref name="safeworkers.co.uk"/&gt;

==Complications==

===Slouching===
{{see also|Kyphosis}}
Proper posture is often referred to as a "[[neutral spine]]"; slouching is an improper posture or a "nonneutral spine"

Slouching is often times described as improper posture, movement or rigidity of the spine, especially the cervical and thoracic regions, in relation to other parts of the body.

===Varicose veins===
[[Varicose veins]] are veins that have become enlarged and twisted, especially within the legs, ankles and feet of an affected individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/varicose-veins/basics/definition/con-20043474 |title=Diseases and Conditions: Varicose veins |author=Mayo Clinic Staff |publisher=[[Mayo Clinic]] |accessdate=December 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When standing, gravity pulls the blood downwards to the lower part of the body. Body mechanisms, such as [[vasoconstriction]] and valves of the [[veins]], assist in pumping blood upwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sirweb.org/patients/varicose-veins/|title=Society of Interventional Radiology- Patient center|author=|date=|work=SIRweb.org|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As blood is pumped through the body, the valves within the veins prevent the blood from flowing backwards. After extensive, prolonged standing, these valves can become weak and eventually fail. When this happens, blood is no longer being prevented from flowing backward. Gravity will pull the blood back into an individuals legs, ankles and feet. This forces the veins to expand or "balloon" to accommodate this extra blood.

The valves of the [[veins]] work best in concert with accompanying muscle contractions that force the blood to continue moving up the leg. Standing with some muscles constantly strained weakens these muscles and therefore the strength of the contractions. Varicose veins have also been associated with chronic heart and circulatory disorders and hypertension as well as complications related to pregnancy.

Prolonged standing increases the risk for hospitalization from varicose veins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tuchsen|first1=F|title=Prolonged standing at work and hospitalization due to varicose veins: a 12 year prospective study of the Danish population.|journal=Occup Environ Med|date=2005|volume=62|pages=847–850}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the working age population one out of five hospitalizations from varicose veins are as a result of prolonged standing. Prolonged standing leads to impeded blood flow and stasis in the veins in the lower limbs, which can cause varicose veins.

===Cardiovascular disorders===
Standing for prolonged periods can lead to certain cardiovascular disorders. In a study by Krause et al. (2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krause|first1=N|title=Standing at work and progression of carotid atherosclerosis|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment &amp; Health|date=2000|pages=227–236|doi=10.5271/sjweh.536|volume=26|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the authors examined the relationship between standing at work and the progression of carotid [[atherosclerosis]] in men. Standing for long periods can change the distribution of blood in the extremities. This in turn causes the blood to pool and reduces the circulating blood plasma volume leading to hemodynamic changes that impact the body. The authors reported that long periods of standing at work were significantly associated with atherosclerotic progression. This study provides evidence that hemodynamic changes from standing can influence the progressions of carotid atherosclerosis. The authors also found that men with carotid stenosis or ischemic heart disease were at greater risk for the progression of atherosclerosis . Atherosclerosis can lead to coronary artery disease, carotid artery disease, peripheral artery disease, and aneurysms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriosclerosis-atherosclerosis/basics/complications/con-20026972&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joint compression===
Standing places significant pressure on the joint of the hips, knees, ankle and feet but without any significant movement of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hazards.org/standing/|title=Standing - Hazards Magazine|author=|date=|work=Hazards.org|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reduces the normal lubrication and cushioning of synovial joints, causing them to tear. The combined effect of pressure and tearing can cause extensive amounts of pain and make it difficult to move or walk.&lt;ref name=whsc/&gt;

===Muscle fatigue===
Muscles kept in a constant stress position quickly become exhausted and can result in pain and swelling in the lower back, legs, ankles and feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safeworkers.co.uk/standing-for-long-periods.html|title=Standing for Long Periods|author=|date=|work=SafeWorkers.co.uk|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rnj.166/abstract|title=Evidence of Health Risks Associated with Prolonged Standing at Work and Intervention Effectiveness|first1=Thomas R.|last1=Waters|first2=Robert B.|last2=Dick|date=1 May 2015|publisher=|journal=Rehabil Nurs|volume=40|issue=3|pages=148–165|accessdate=23 February 2017|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1002/rnj.166|pmid=25041875| pmc=4591921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has stated that muscle fatigue and musculoskeletal disorders account for "33% of all worker injury and illness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/ergonomics/|title=Safety and Health Topics - Ergonomics - Occupational Safety and Health Administration|author=|date=|work=OSHA.gov|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considerable research has been conducted as to the extent of muscle injuries and all have concluded that these are expected but can be reduced with breaks and the availability of chairs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Research has shown that the body experiences muscle fatigue after standing for five hours; this fatigue persists for more than 30 minutes after the end of the work day according to electronic measurements of fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garcia|first1=M|title=Longterm muscle fatigue after standing work|journal=Human Factors|date=2015|volume=57|issue=7|pages=1162–1173|doi=10.1177/0018720815590293}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perception of fatigue is subjective and does not necessarily correlate with the experimental indicators of fatigue.

==Pregnancy==
Walking or standing more than six hours per day has been linked with pre-term births, low birth weights as well as high blood pressure for the mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/247272.php|title=Prolonged Standing During Pregnancy May Result In Stunted Fetal Growth|author=|date=|work=MedicalNewsToday.com|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have found that working more than 25 hours a week has been "associated with slower rates of fetal growth". They also found that, on average, there are no "negative effects of working up to 36 weeks into pregnancy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/36507-pregnancy-working-baby-growth.html|title=Standing for Long Hours During Pregnancy May Slow Babies' Growth|author=|date=|work=LiveScience.com|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Productivity==
A systematic review from Karakolis and Callaghan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karakolis|first1=T|title=The impact of sitstand office workstations on worker discomfort and productivity: a review|journal=Applied Ergonomics|volume=45|issue=3|pages=799–806|doi=10.1016/j.apergo.2013.10.001|pmid=24157240|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that sit-stand workstations did not reduce worker productivity. Three of the reviewed studies found increased productivity when workers used sit stand stations, four reported no impact on the productivity of workers, and one reported mixed results.

==Intervention==
There is no real prevention for standing, but there are ways to mitigate time spent standing in the workplace. Experts suggest to move around and change positions throughout the day. It is best not to sit in one position for more than 20 minutes, or to stand in one position for more than 8 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/health-wellness/2014/11/03/yes-sitting-work-bad-but-standing-actually-better/7ceei6fb0B7QjgAH3FlOrK/story.html|title=Yes sitting at work is bad, but is standing actually better? - The Boston Globe|author=|date=|work=BostonGlobe.com|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If prolonged sitting in the workplace is required or desired, individuals should gradually transition to significant periods of standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buckley|first1=J.P.|title=The sedentary office: a growing case for change toward better health and productivity. Expert statement commissioned by Public Health England and the Active Working Community Interest Company|journal=Br J Sports Med|date=2015|volume=49|issue=21|pages=1357–62|doi=10.1136/bjsports-2015-094618|pmid=26034192}}&lt;/ref&gt; When transitioning from sitting to standing, individuals might experience musculoskeletal discomfort or fatigue while the body adapts.

Companies should design workstations that are conducive to good health. Workstations should allow workers to choose between several working positions and to move easily between them.&lt;ref name="ccohs.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/ergonomics/standing/standing_basic.html|title=Working in a Standing Position - Basic Information : OSH Answers|first=Government of Canada, Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and|last=Safety|date=|work=CCOHS.ca|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, workers should be able to adjust the height of their workstations to fit their body size. Other helpful aspects of workstations are footrests, elbow rests, and seats so workers can sit when they need to.

==Footwear==

The choice of footwear can change the impact of prolonged standing. Shoes should support the foot, have shock-absorbing cushions, fit the foot well, and be comfortable.&lt;ref name="ccohs.ca"/&gt; Shoes should not be flat, have heels higher than 5&amp;nbsp;cm, or change the shape of the foot. There are also special insoles for shoes that can be used when soft mats or chairs are not available. Additionally the floors in a work area should not be metal or concrete. It is best to have cork or rubber covered floors. Floors should not be slippery.

Training and education are important components of avoiding complications from standing. Employees trained in ergonomics experience less muscle discomfort and more productivity while using sit-stand work stations than workers not trained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robertson,|first1=M.M.|title=Office ergonomics training and a sitstand workstation: Effects on musculoskeletal and visual symptoms and performance of office workers|journal=Applied Ergonomics|volume=44|issue=1|pages=73–85|doi=10.1016/j.apergo.2012.05.001|pmid=22727324|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Floor mats==

Proper floor mats can also be used to reduce stress on feet and knees. Anti-fatigue matting is recommended and launderable matting is preferred.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} A study investigating the effects of 4 different standing conditions on assembly workers showed that using mats and shoes with in-soles was perceived as more comfortable for the workers than without while standing on hard floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12236657|title=A comparison of the effects of floor mats and shoe in-soles on standing fatigue|journal=Applied ergonomics|volume=33|issue=5|pages=477–84|last=|first=|date=|website=|year=2002|author1=King|first1=P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18275">{{ For|the 2002 film|The Slaughter Rule}}
A '''mercy rule''',  '''slaughter rule''', '''knockout rule''', or '''skunk rule''' ends a two-competitor [[sports competition]] earlier than the scheduled endpoint if one competitor has a very large and presumably insurmountable [[Score (sport)|scoring]] lead over the other. It is called the ''mercy'' rule because it spares further humiliation for the loser. It is common in [[youth sports]] in [[North America]], where [[running up the score]] is considered unsporting. It is especially common in  [[baseball]] and [[softball]] in which there is no [[game clock]] and a dominant team could in theory continue an [[inning]] endlessly.

The rules vary widely, depending on the level of competition, but nearly all [[youth sports]] leagues and [[high school sports]] associations and many [[college sports]] associations in the United States have mercy rules for sports including baseball, softball, American football and association football.

However, mercy rules usually do not take effect until a prescribed point in the game (like the second half of an association football game). Thus, one team, particularly if it is decidedly better than a weaker opponent, can still "run up the score" before the rule takes effect. For instance, in [[American football]], one team could be ahead by 70 points with three minutes left in the first half; in baseball, the better team could have a 20-run lead in the second inning, but the game would still continue.

==Baseball and softball==
International competitions are sanctioned by the [[World Baseball Softball Confederation]] (WBSC), formed by the 2013 merger of the [[International Baseball Federation]] (IBAF) and [[International Softball Federation]] (ISF).

In international baseball competition and the [[World Baseball Classic]] (WBC), games are ended when one team is ahead by 10 runs, once at least seven completed innings are played by the trailing team. In women's competition, the same applies after five innings of a seven-inning game.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Baseball Federation]] (2008). [http://s29178.gridserver.com/pdf/International_Rules_ENG.pdf IBAF Official Competitions Technical/Organisational Norms - Valid only for 2008]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Rule C7.8, "Run difference Rule". Accessed on 2008-03-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2006 World Baseball Classic|inaugural WBC]] in 2006 followed the IBAF mercy rule, with an additional rule stopping a game after five innings when a team is ahead by at least 15 runs.&lt;ref&gt;World Baseball Classic, Inc. [http://ww2.worldbaseballclassic.com/2006/about/index.jsp?sid=wbc 2006 World Baseball Classic: FAQ]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Accessed on 2008-03-13.&lt;/ref&gt; The mercy rules applied to the round-robin (now double-elimination) matches only, not to the semi-finals or final.

In a six-inning game such as [[Little League Baseball|Little League Baseball and Softball]], rules call for the game to end if the winning team is ahead by 15 runs after three innings played or 10 runs after four innings played by the trailing team.

Softball rules are different for fast/modified fast pitch and slow pitch. In WBSC-sanctioned competitions, the run ahead rule (the WBSC terminology) is, for fast or modified fast pitch, 20 runs after three innings, 15 after four, or 7 after 5. In slow pitch, the margin is 20 runs after four innings or 15 after five.&lt;ref name=ISF&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[International Softball Federation]] |author=International Softball Federation Playing Rules Committee |url=http://www.internationalsoftball.com/english/rules_standards/Rulebook_2002.pdf |format=PDF |title=Official Rules of Softball (Revised 2005) Rule 5, Sec. 5, "Run Ahead Rule" |accessdate=2008-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218104659/http://www.internationalsoftball.com/english/rules_standards/Rulebook_2002.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NCAA has also adopted the rule.

In regular season or conference tournament [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] and [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] college baseball, the IBAF rule may be implemented. Most NCAA conferences limit the rule to the final day of a series, for travel reasons, or primarily during conference tournaments where four to five games are played in a day, in order to allow the next game to start. The rule is not allowed in NCAA tournament play (regionals, super regionals and College World Series), in which all games must be at least nine innings.

In NCAA softball, the rule is invoked if one team is ahead by at least eight runs after five innings and, unlike with college baseball, applies in the NCAA tournament as well with the exception of the championship series. In American high school softball, most states use a mercy rule of 20 runs ahead in three innings or 10 in five innings. (In either case, if the home team is ahead by the requisite number of runs, the game will end after the top half of the inning.)

Most state high school associations (where games are seven innings) use the IBAF Women's rule after five innings have been played by the trailing team; some associations further the rule by ending a game after either three or four innings if the lead is at least 15 runs. For softball, the rule is 12 after three innings and 10 after five. However, since the home team has the last at-bat, the rules usually allow visiting teams to score an unlimited number of runs in the top half of an inning. That can be prevented by invoking the rule only after the home team has completed its half of the inning.

Due to the untimed nature of innings, some leagues either impose caps on the number of runs that can be scored in one inning (usually in the 4-8 range) or limit the number of plate appearances in an inning (typically, such a limit will consist of one rotation of the batting order).  Such rules ensure that games will complete in a reasonable length of time, but it can also mean that a lead of a certain size becomes insurmountable by the cap, which can be prevented by not invoking the rule in such circumstances.

== American football ==

===Middle and high school football===
At the middle- or high-school level, 34 states use a mercy rule that may involve a "continuous clock" (the clock continues to operate on most plays when the clock would normally stop, such as an incomplete pass) once a team has a certain lead (for example, 35 points) during the second half. That greatly decreases the amount of time taken for a game to complete, which reduces the leading team's chances to score more and the time that the trailing team must spend in facing an insurmountable deficit. In most states, the clock stops only for scores, timeouts (officials', injury, or charged), or the end of the quarter. Plays that would normally stop the clock, such as penalties, incomplete passes, going out of bounds, or change of possession, would not stop the clock. The rule varies by state; for example, the clock does not stop upon a score in Colorado, [[Kansas State High School Activities Association|Kansas]] (regular-season games only), or [[Missouri State High School Activities Association|Missouri]] (fourth quarter only). 

In most states, once the point differential is reduced to below the mercy rule-invoking amount, normal timing procedures resume until either the end of the game or the mercy rule-invoking point differential is re-established; in Colorado and Kansas, the clock continues to run even if the differential falls below the threshold. Most states that have mercy rules waive this rule for a championship game.

In some states, coaches and game officials may choose to end a game at their own discretion at any time during the second half if the continuous clock rule is in effect; that usually happens if a lopsided margin continues to increase or if threatening weather is imminent. Sometimes the coach of the team that is losing agrees to shorten the length of a quarter in addition to the continuous clock rule. Although it is rare, some states or high school conferences have rules in which the team with a very large lead may not run a certain play for the rest of the game, such as a deep pass or outside run.

In some states (where [[Eight-man football|8-man]] and [[Six-man football|6-man football]] is widely used), the rules call for a game to end when one team is ahead by a certain score (like 45 or 50 points) at halftime or any time thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nfhs.org/core/contentmanager/uploads/2007MERCYRULE.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921023325/http://www.nfhs.org/core/contentmanager/uploads/2007MERCYRULE.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other states with 6- or 8-man football, continuous clock rules are used, and the rule may be modified; for instance, in Iowa, the rule goes into effect if the 35-point differential is reached at any time after the first quarter.

In a variant on the mercy rule used in [[Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference|Connecticut high school football]] from 2006 to 2016, the team's coach was issued a one-game suspension (i.e., for the team's next game) if at any point the team had a 50-point lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.norwichbulletin.com/sports/20160627/ciac-eliminates-50-point-rule-in-high-school-football|title=CIAC eliminates 50-point rule in high school football|last=Poole|first=Owen|work=The Bulletin|access-date=2018-05-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 it was replaced with a running clock rule.

===College football===
The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]'s mercy rule provides,  "Any time during the game, the playing time of any remaining period or periods and the intermission between halves may be shortened by mutual agreement of the opposing head coaches and the referee." (NCAA Football Rule 3-2-2-a)&lt;ref&gt;http://amarefs.org/FR16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; NCAA Football Approved Ruling 3-2-2-I cites an example: "At halftime the score is 56–0. The coaches and the referee agree that the third and fourth quarters should be shortened to 12 minutes each. The coaches also request that the second half be played with a 'running clock' i.e., that the game clock not be stopped." The NCAA Football Rules Committee determined, "The remaining quarters may be shortened to 12 minutes each. However, the 'running clock' is not allowed; normal clock rules apply for the entire game." &lt;ref&gt;http://amarefs.org/FR16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent example of an NCAA football game shortened by invoking this rule occurred September 1, 2018 during a game Georgia played against Austin Peay in Athens Georgia.  With the score 45-0 in the 3rd quarter and a high heat index, the Austin Peay Coach Will Healy suggested to Georgia head coach Kirby Smart that they play a 10 minute fourth quarter instead of the typical 15 minute fourth quarter.  The coaches and referee agreed and the game was shortened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ajc.com/sports/georgia-opens-season-with-rout-austin-peay/oRmlUq5gQFE8rwmdsGHQ2K/|title=Georgia opens its season with a rout of Austin Peay|work=ajc|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

September 24, 2016 the [[2016 Missouri Tigers football team|Missouri Tigers]] led [[2016 Delaware State Hornets football team|Delaware State]] 58–0 at halftime. The coaches agreed to shorten the third and fourth quarters from 15 minutes to 10 minutes each, shortening the total game time from 60 minutes to 50 minutes. Missouri added three touchdowns in the abbreviated second half to make the final score 79–0, setting team records for the most points scored in a game (79), the greatest margin of victory (79), and the largest number of touchdowns scored (11). (Missouri would have scored 80 points, but it had missed an extra point early in the game).

Also in 2016, the game between [[2016 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]] and [[2016 South Carolina State Bulldogs football team|South Carolina State]] had both the third and fourth quarters shortened from 15 minutes to 12 as a result of  Clemson leading the game at half 45-0.  The final score of the game was 59-0. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/college/ct-college-football-shortening-games-spt-20160918-story.html &lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier in 2016, the game between [[2016 Texas State Bobcats football team|Texas State]] and [[2016 Arkansas Razorbacks football team|Arkansas]] saw the fourth quarter shortened to 10 minutes when severe thunderstorms were approaching [[Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium]]. Arkansas led 42–3 at the end of the third quarter, and the final period was scoreless.  A similar scenario took place in 2017 in the game between [[2017 TCU Horned Frogs football team|TCU]] and [[2017 Kansas Jayhawks football team|Kansas]], where the coaches agreed to a running clock for the final 12:49 of the game due to severe thunderstorms approaching [[Amon G. Carter Stadium]].

In a 2013 game, [[2013 Old Dominion Monarchs football team|Old Dominion University]] (ODU) was losing to the [[2013 North Carolina Tar Heels football team|University of North Carolina]] (UNC) 80–20 when ODU coach [[Bobby Wilder]] asked for the fourth quarter to be shortened by five minutes, which UNC coach [[Larry Fedora]] agreed to. Fedora also directed his quarterback to take a knee on fourth and goal with 1:53 remaining to not run up the score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tarheels score 80 in 3 quarters|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1862918-old-dominion-vs-north-carolina-shortened-as-tar-heels-score-80-in-3-quarters/|work=Bleacher Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1988 game, [[Kansas Jayhawks football|Kansas Jayhawks]] coach [[Glen Mason]] asked if a running clock could be used after his team trailed 49–0 at halftime to the [[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn Tigers]]. Auburn coach [[Pat Dye]] and the officials agreed, and Auburn ended up a 56–7 winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1004441/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Look, Toto! | date=1992-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the NCAA Football Rules Committee's subsequent ruling (A.R. 3-2-2-I) that a "running clock" is not permitted, a continuous clock was used September 5, 2013, beginning in the fourth quarter when the [[2013 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team|Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]] had a 63–0 lead against the [[2013 Elon Phoenix football team|Elon Phoenix]]. That was at the request of Elon coach [[Jason Swepson]] and agreed upon by Georgia Tech coach [[Paul Johnson (American football coach)|Paul Johnson]]. Georgia Tech won the game 70–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sugiura|first=Ken|title=Johnson on Duke, Elon, no-huddle|url=http://www.ajc.com/weblogs/georgia-tech/2013/sep/04/johnson-duke-elon-no-huddle/|work=The Atlanta Journal Constitution|accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the Mississippi Association of Community and Junior Colleges, a running clock is allowed if the team is ahead by 38 points or more. This rule was instituted in 2013.

==Amateur boxing==
If a boxer trails by more than 20 points, the referee stops the fight and the boxer that is leading automatically wins; bouts which end this way may be noted as "RSC" (referee stopped contest) with notations for an outclassed opponent (RSCO), outscored opponent (RSCOS), injury (RSCI) or head injury (RSCH).

While a boxer who loses on the mercy rule is scored RSCO and would be similar to a technical [[knockout]] in [[professional boxing]], it is not scored a loss by knockout, and the 28-day suspension for losing on a knockout does not apply.

==Association football (soccer)==
[[International Blind Sports Federation]] rules require that any time during a game in which one team has scored ten (10) more goals than the other team that game is deemed completed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibsa.es/eng/deportes/goalball/IBSA%20Goalball%20Rules%202006-2010.txt International Blind Sports Federation: Goalball Rules] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712075230/http://www.ibsa.es/eng/deportes/goalball/IBSA%20Goalball%20Rules%202006-2010.txt |date=2007-07-12 }} Section 17.7&lt;/ref&gt; In US high school soccer, most states use a mercy rule that ends the game if one team is ahead by 10 or more goals at any point from halftime onward. Youth soccer leagues use variations on the rule.

==Basketball==
In high school basketball, many states have a "continuous clock" rule, similar to American football, which takes effect in the second half after a lead grows to a prescribed point (in Iowa, 35 points or more; in Kansas, 30 points or more but only in the fourth quarter). The clock stops only for charged, officials' or injury time-outs; or at the end of the third quarter. The clock would not stop when would normally stop, such as for fouls, free throws, out-of-bounds plays or substitutions.

The rules vary when normal timing procedures take effect after a lead is diminished (such as because of the trailing team's rally); for instance, in Iowa, normal timing procedures are enforced if the lead is lowered to 25 points but re-instituted once the lead grows back to 35 or more points. By comparison, in Kansas, if the running clock is triggered, it will not stop except for a timeout or an injury even if the differential is reduced to under 30 points. As with other sports, some states offer provisions to allow a team to end the game early by mutual decision of the coaches (for instance, if a large lead continues to grow and the talent disparity is obvious).

==Collegiate wrestling==
In American [[collegiate wrestling]] and high school wrestling, a wrestler wins by [[technical fall]], and the match ends, if he builds a 15-point lead. If a wrestler gains a 15-point lead by having his opponent in a near-fall, the referee will allow the offensive wrestler the opportunity to win by fall without liability to be reversed and pinned. The bout ends when a fall is awarded or the near-fall ends.

== Posture and natural curvatures ==

The word ''posture'' comes from the [[Latin]] verb ''ponere'', which means "to put or place." The general concept of [[human posture]] refers to the "carriage of the body as a whole, the attitude of the body, or the position of the limbs (the arms and legs)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
  |title =Definition of Posture
  |publisher =Webster's New World Medical Dictionary
  |url =http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9731
  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Webster's New World Medical Dictionary defines ''neutral posture'' as the stance that is attained "when the joints are not bent and the spine is aligned and not twisted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
  |title =Definition of Neutral Posture
  |publisher =Webster's New World Medical Dictionary
  |url =http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=25488
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neutral posture has given rise to the idea of achieving ideal posture. Ideal posture indicates proper alignment of the body’s segments such that the least amount of energy is required to maintain a desired position. The benefit of achieving this ideal position would be that the least amount of stress is placed on the body’s tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

== Postural stability ==

Currently, there are 3 main hypotheses suggesting how humans maintain postural stability while standing:
# ''Stiffness of ankle joint'': The [[stiffness]] model was first introduced by Winter et al., in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Winter D.A. |author2=Patla A.E. |author3=Rietdyk S. |author4=Ishac M.G. | year = 2001 | title = Ankle Muscle Stiffness in the Control of Balance During Quiet Standing | url = | journal = Journal of Neurophysiology | volume = 85 | issue = | pages = 2630–2633 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and states that simple stiffness of [[ankle]] [[muscle]]s account for the control of balance during quiet standing. The stiffness of the ankle muscle was determined experimentally by summing up the [[Moment (physics)|moments]] (or [[torque]]) left and right about the ankle and dividing it by the sway angle (angle at which the [[center of mass]] is displaced from the [[center of pressure (terrestrial locomotion)|center of pressure]]). It was found in both analytical and experimental data (using human subjects) that there was a [[linear]] relationship between moments about the ankle muscle and sway angle. Additionally, the stiffness (i.e. total moment divided by sway angle) was found to be very close to 1, indicating a resemblance between the [[ankle]] [[joint]] and a perfect [[Spring (device)|spring]].
# ''Moment arm of ankle muscles'': The [[moment arm]] of ankle muscle hypothesis for postural stability was first developed in 1993 by Young et al.&lt;ref&gt;Young, R.P., G.E. Loeb. "The distal hindlimb musculature of the cat: multiaxis moment arms at the ankle joint". Exp Brain Res (1993) 96:141-151.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been primarily seen in cats, though it is speculated that such mechanisms may also exist in humans. Results obtained from Young et al. showed that in the cat ankle joint, many of its muscles have predominant moment arms about the adduction/abduction axis. Smaller [[Moment (physics)|moment]] arms are found in inversion/eversion and about the principal axis of motion, dorsiflexion/extension. Additionally, Young et al. showed that the magnitudes of the moment arms in [[Abduction (kinesiology)|abduction]]/[[adduction]] and [[Inversion (kinesiology)|inversion]]/[[Eversion (kinesiology)|eversion]] strongly depended on joint angle. As the joint angle moved increasingly away from the [[neutral axis]], the magnitude of the moment arms also increased. Such a finding suggests that, at least in cats, the [[Muscle coactivation|coactivation]] of these [[Antagonist (muscle)|agonist-antagonist]]muscles is used for immediate stabilization in posture.
# ''Proprioception'': [[Proprioception]] means "sense of self". In limbs, proprioceptors are sensors that provide information about joint angle, muscle length, and tension, which is integrated to give information about the position of the [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]] in space. For postural stability, it has been suggested that stretch receptors may contribute to immediate stabilization in posture. However, researchers have found a weak correlation between muscle length and ankle joint angle, indicating that the stretch reflex is probably not the main contributor to postural stability. Additionally, there is approximately a 30 ms time delay between any stretch receptor response to a change in muscle length, which further supports the idea that stretch receptors may not have a big contribution to postural stability. However, this should not rule out the role of all proprioceptors in maintaining postural stability in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bloem B.R. |author2=Allum J.H.J. |author3=Carpenter M.G. | year = 2000 | title = Is lower leg proprioception essential for triggering human automatic postural responses? | url = | journal = Exp Brain Res | volume = 130 | issue = | pages = 375–391 | doi=10.1007/s002219900259}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bloem B.R. |author2=Allum J.H.J. |author3=Carpenter M.G. |author4=Verschuuren J.J.G.M. |author5=Honegger F. | year = 2002 | title = Triggering of balance corrections and compensatory strategies in a patient with total leg proprioceptive loss | url = | journal = Exp Brain Res | volume = 142 | issue = | pages = 91–107 | doi=10.1007/s00221-001-0926-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While these are the three leading hypotheses, of course there is always a possibility that there is a combination of all mechanisms that ultimately allows humans to maintain postural stability during quiet standing. Additionally, it is important to keep in mind that there are also many physiological factors such as weight, [[Neuronal noise|internal noise]] to muscles, etc. that may come into play when trying to understand the factors that contribute to postural stability.

Deviations from neutral alignment are identified as excessive curvature or reduction in curvature. Rarely do these deviations in curvature occur in only one plane; however, they are typically referred to in this manner.&lt;ref name="Vrtovec 2009 593–605"&gt;{{Citation

[[Scoliosis]] is well established and even evaluated at an early age. It is typically quantified using the standardized [[Cobb angle|Cobb angle method]].

It serves as the standard method for quantification of scoliosis deformities.&lt;ref name="Vrtovec 2009 593–605"/&gt; Sagittal plane posture aberrations such as cervical and lumbar lordosis and thoracic kyphosis have yet to be quantified due to considerable inter-individual variability in normal sagittal curvature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

[[File:USMC-05301.jpg|thumb|A [[US Marine]] performs plyometric jumps in [[Camp Foster]], [[Okinawa]]]]

'''Plyometrics''', also known as '''jump training''' or '''plyos''', are exercises in which [[muscle]]s exert maximum force in short intervals of time, with the goal of increasing power (speed-strength). This training focuses on learning to move from a muscle [[Extension (kinesiology)|extension]] to a [[Muscle contraction|contraction]] in a rapid or "explosive" manner, such as in specialized repeated jumping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chu|first=Donald|title=Jumping into plyometrics|year=1998|publisher=Human Kinetics|location=Champaign, IL|isbn=0880118466|pages=1–4|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plyometrics are primarily used by [[Sportsperson|athletes]], especially [[martial arts|martial artists]], sprinters and [[high jump]]ers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://athleteculture.com/training/an-athletes-guide-to-jumping-higher-vertical-jump-secrets-uncovered/|title=An Athlete’s Guide to Jumping Higher: Vertical Jump Secrets Uncovered!|last=Starks|first=Joe|date=25 April 2013|publisher=Athlete Culture|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to improve performance,&lt;ref name="Yessis"&gt;{{cite book |author= Michael Yessis |title=Explosive Plyometrics |publisher=Ultimate Athlete Concepts|year=2009 |isbn=978-098171806-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are used in the fitness field to a much lesser degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doctoryessis.com/public/Why_is_plyometrics_so_misunderstood_and_misapplied.cfm|title=Why is plyometrics so misunderstood and misapplied?|last=Yessis|first=Michael|publisher=doctoryessis.com|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Plyometrics includes explosive powerful training exercises that are trained to activate the quick response and elastic properties of the major muscles in the body. It was initially made famous by Soviet Olympians in the 1970s, providing the core element in the strength programs of elite sporting athletes worldwide.  Sports using plyometrics include basketball, tennis, badminton, squash and volleyball as well as the various codes of football.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ultrafitnessmag.com.au/Train/Ground/tabid/4592/entryid/457/RUNNING-STRONG-INTRODUCING-PLYOMETRICS.aspx|title=RUNNING STRONG, INTRODUCING PLYOMETRICS|website=Fitness PRO Magazine|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "plyometrics" was coined by [[Fred Wilt]] after watching Soviet athletes prepare for their events in track and field; he felt this was a key to their success.&lt;ref name="Wilt"&gt;Wilt, Fred &amp; Yessis, Michael. ''Soviet Theory, Technique and Training for Running and Hurdling.'' Vol 1. Championship Books, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;  He began a collaboration with Soviet ([[Russia|Russian]]) trainer [[Michael Yessis]] to promote plyometrics.

Since its introduction in the early 1980s, two forms of plyometrics have evolved. In the original version of plyometrics, created by Russian scientist Yuri Verkhoshansky, it was defined as the shock method.&lt;ref name="Verkhoshansky1966"&gt;{{cite book|author= Yuri Verkhoshansky|title=Perspectives in the Improvement of Speed-Strength Preparation of Jumpers|journal=Legkaya Atletika(Track and Field)|volume=9|pages=11–12|year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Verkhoshanski2"&gt;{{cite book|author= Yuri Verkhoshanski|title=Are Depth Jumps Useful?|journal= Legkaya Atletika (Track and Field)|volume=12|pages=9|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this, the athlete would drop down from a height and experience a "shock" upon landing. This in turn would bring about a forced [[eccentric contraction]] which was then immediately switched to a [[concentric contraction]] as the athlete jumped upward. The landing and takeoff are executed in an extremely short period of time, in the range of 0.1–0.2 second. The shock method is the most effective method used by athletes to improve their speed, quickness, and power after development of a strong strength base.&lt;ref name="Verkhoshanski2" /&gt;

Rather than using the term plyometrics to indicate exercises utilizing the shock method, it may be preferable to use the term explosive or true plyometrics which can be considered the same as the plyometrics originally created by Verkhoshansky.&lt;ref name="Yessis" /&gt;  The shock method that he created was the result of studying the actions that occur in running and jumping.  He found that the landings and takeoffs in these two skills involved high ground reaction forces that were executed in an extremely quick and explosive manner.  For example, time of execution of the landing and takeoff in jumping was close to 0.20 second and in sprinting it was approximately 0.10 second.&lt;ref name="Verkhoshansky1966" /&gt;

Since one of the main objectives of the Soviet research was to develop practical methods of training to improve athletic performance, Verkhoshansky tackled the task of how these forces in explosive execution could be duplicated in an exercise.  By doing exercises such as the depth jump, that he created, the athlete would enhance his ability in the takeoff and his resultant performance in the running or jumping event.&lt;ref name="Verkhoshanski2" /&gt;  He experimented with many different exercises, but the depth jump appeared to be the best for duplicating the forces in the landing and takeoff.

The second version of plyometrics, seen to a great extent in the [[United States]], relates to doing any form of jump regardless of execution time. Such jumps cannot be considered truly plyometric (as described by Verkhoshansky) since the intensity of execution is much lower and the time required for transitioning from the eccentric to the concentric contraction is much greater.  The term plyometrics became very popular with the publication of many books on the subject matter.  It now appears impossible to go back to its original meaning and method of execution. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

As a result, it is important to distinguish which type of "plyometric" exercise is used in order to determine its effectiveness and potential to receive the stated benefits. Though the name plyometrics is given to all jumps, not all jumps are plyometric. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Etymology==
The term plyometric is a combination of [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] roots that means to increase measurement — ''plio-'' means "more" and ''metric'' means "to measure".

==History==
[[Fred Wilt]], a former [[US Olympic]] [[long-distance runner]], is credited with coining the term plyometrics. He admits that it is not a very good term, but it was the best he could come up with after watching the [[Russians]] execute jumps in their warm-ups prior to their event in [[track and field]]. He could not understand why the Russians were doing all of these jumps while the Americans were doing multiple static stretches, but he firmly believed it was one of the reasons why they were so successful in many events.&lt;ref name="Wilt" /&gt;
From its beginnings in the early 1980s, the term plyometrics gained greater popularity and is now well established.  When Fred Wilt learned of the work being done by [[Michael Yessis]] in the field of Russian training methods, they quickly teamed up to help disseminate information on plyometrics.

In collaboration with Yessis who visited and worked with Verkhoshansky&lt;ref&gt;McCadam, K., "Russian Training Legend: Dr. Yuri Verkhoshansky." Retrieved online April 22, 2012 from http://www.pushtheground.com/2011/06/russian-traning-legend-dr-yuri.html&lt;/ref&gt; in the former Soviet Union the early 1980s, the term plyometrics and how it is used (practiced) was gradually disseminated in the US.  Yessis brought this information on plyometrics back to the US and in the following years was able to create even more ways of using this method to train and improve explosive power. 
  
Plyometrics (the shock method) was created by Yuri Verkhoshansky in the late 1960s, early 1970s.&lt;ref name="Verkhoshanski2" /&gt; Since then, the shock method of plyometrics is still being practiced for improvement of athletic performance by what appears to be a relatively limited number of athletes. These athletes still do depth jumps, the key exercise in the shock method, according to the guidelines established by Verkhoshansky.

Most athletes execute simple and complex jumps and call them plyometrics rather than jump training as it was called in the past.  This includes the depth jump which was executed in ways different from what was recommended by Verkhoshansky.  This form of jump training is very popular but plyometrics is a buzzword for all types of jumps, regardless of how long it takes to execute the jump. Its use is so pervasive that it is even possible to find push-ups described as being plyometric.

Due to the wide use and appeal of the term plyometrics, the true meaning of plyometrics as developed by  Verkhoshansky has for the most part been forgotten. Verkhoshansky was well known and respected worldwide in both the scientific and in the coaching arenas.  He was relatively unknown in the United States except for some of his articles that were translated and published in the "Soviet Sports Review", later called the "Fitness and Sports Review International."

In addition to creating the shock method, Verkhoshansky is credited with developing the stretch-shortening concept of muscle contractions and the development of specialized (dynamic correspondence) strength exercises. Plyometrics, or more specifically the shock method, is considered a form of specialized strength development.

Before undertaking plyometric training, it is necessary to distinguish jumps that are commonly called plyometric and true plyometric jumps as exemplified in the depth jump which is illustrative of the shock method. Since its inception in the former Soviet Union as the shock method, there have been other forms of the plyometric exercises created by Yessis that do not involve jump exercises.  For details and illustrations of these exercises see "Explosive Running"&lt;ref name="Yessis2000"&gt;{{cite book |author= Michael Yessis |title=Explosive Running |publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.; 1st edition|year=2000 |isbn=978-0809298990}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Explosive Plyometrics".&lt;ref name="Yessis" /&gt;  These exercises involve the stretch-shorten concept that underlies the shock method.

==Method==
In the depth jump, the athlete experiences a shock on landing in which the hip, knee, and ankle extensor muscles undergo a powerful eccentric contraction. For the muscles to respond explosively, the eccentric contraction is then quickly switched to the isometric (when the downward movement stops) and then the concentric contraction, in a minimum amount of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=A.S. Medvedev |author2=V.V. Marchenko |author3=S.V. Fomichenko |title=Speed-Strength Structure of Vertical Jumps by Qualified Weightlifters in Different Take-off Conditions (Condensed)|journal=Soviet Sports Review International-Teoriya I Praktika Fizicheskoi Kultury|volume=19|pages=164–167|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This allows the athlete to jump upward as high as possible.
  
In the eccentric contraction, the muscles are involuntarily lengthened, while in the concentric contraction, the muscles are shortened after being tensed.  Most of the stretching and shortening takes place in the tendons that attach to the muscles involved rather than in the muscles.  
To execute the depth jump, the athlete stands on a raised platform, usually not greater than {{convert|20|-|30|in|cm}} high, and then steps out and drops down in a vertical pathway to make contact with the floor.  The height used by most athletes is usually quite low in the early stages of training.  The key is how high the athlete jumps in relation to the height of the takeoff platform.  Technique and jump height are most important at this time.  
While the body is dropping, the athlete consciously prepares the muscles for the impact by tensing the muscles.  The flooring upon which the athlete drops down on should be somewhat resilient, mainly for prevention of injury. Upon making contact with the floor, the athlete then goes into slight leg flex to absorb some of the force for safety.  However, the main role played by the muscles and tendons is to withstand the force that is experienced in the landing.  This force is withstood in eccentric contraction.  When muscle contraction is sufficiently great, it is able to stop the downward movement very quickly.

This phase is sometimes called the phase of amortization in which the athlete absorbs some of the force and stops downward movement by the strong eccentric contraction of the muscles. The strong eccentric contraction prepares the muscles to switch to the concentric contraction in an explosive manner for takeoff.

When the athlete drops down to the floor, the body experiences an impact upon landing. The higher the height of the step-off platform, the greater the impact force upon landing.  This creates a shock to the body which the body responds to by undergoing a strong involuntary muscular contraction to prevent the body from collapsing on the ground. This in turn produces great tension in the muscles and tendons which is then given back in a return upward movement. The faster the change in the muscular contractions, the greater the power created and the resulting height attained.&lt;ref name="Verkhoshanski2" /&gt;

More specifically, the muscles and tendons undergo a stretch (eccentric contraction) while landing which is needed to absorb some of the force generated but most importantly, to withstand the force that is produced by the shock that occurs on the landing. The greater the shock (forces experienced on landing), the stronger the eccentric contraction will be, which in turn produces even greater tension.  This tension, which is potential force, is then given back in the return movement when the muscular contractions switch to the concentric or shortening regime.&lt;ref name="Yessis" /&gt;

However, for maximum return of energy, minimum time must elapse from when the force is received to when they are returned. The greater the time between receiving the forces and giving them back, the less is the return and the less the height that can be achieved in the jump.  Most of the lengthening and shortening occurs in the respective muscle tendons which have greater elasticity.

Another way of saying this is that the faster the switching from the eccentric to the concentric contraction, the greater will be the force produced and the greater the return movement.  The speed of the switching is extremely fast, 0.20 seconds or less.  For example, high-level sprinters execute the switch from the eccentric contraction that occurs when the foot hits the ground to the concentric contraction when the foot breaks contact with the ground in less than 0.10 seconds.  In world-class sprinters, the time is approximately 0.08 seconds.
The exact platform height used by most athletes in the depth jump should be less than {{convert|30|in|cm}} in the early stages of training.  Most athletes start at approximately {{convert|12|in|cm}} after doing some jump training. They then gradually work up to {{convert|20|in|cm}} and then to 30 inches depending upon how well the jumps are executed. The main criterion is that the athlete is jumping as high as possible on every jump.

If the athlete gradually improves his jump height, the same platform height is continued until increases in jump height are no longer observed. At this time, takeoff height is increased by a few inches. If the athlete continually fails to jump very high, the height of the drop-down is lowered somewhat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=N.I. Volkov |author2=V.M. Koryagin |title=Systematization of Special Basketball Exercises (Condensed)|journal=Yessis Review of Soviet Physical Education and Sports|volume=13 #4|pages=110–111|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most important here is how high the athlete jumps after the drop-down.

The maximum platform height used by a high level athlete is no more than {{convert|40|in|cm}}.  Rather than developing greater explosive power this height leads to more eccentric strength development.  Going higher than {{convert|30|in|cm}} is usually counterproductive and may lead to injury.  This occurs when the intensity of the forced involuntary eccentric contraction upon landing is greater than the muscles can withstand.  In addition, the athlete will not be able to execute a quick return (fast transition between muscular contractions), which is the key to successful execution of explosive plyometrics.

Because of the forces involved and the quickness of execution, the central nervous system is strongly involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=N.A. Masalgin |author2=Y.V. Verkhoshansky |author3=L.L. Golovina |author4=A.M. Naraliev |title=The Influence of the Shock Method of Training on the Electromyographic Parameters of Explosive Effort|journal=Teoriya i Praktika Fizicheskoi Kultury (Theory and Practice of Physical Culture)|volume=1|pages=45–46|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important that the athlete not overdo using the shock plyometric method.  Doing so will lead to great fatigue, and, according to Verkhoshansky, sleep disturbances.&lt;ref name="Dr. Yuri Verkhoshansky, Natalia Verkhoshansky 2011"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Yuri Verkhoshansky |author2=Natalia Verkhoshansky |title=Specialized Strength and Conditioning, Manual For Coaches|publisher=Verkhoshansky SSTM|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Athletes have great difficulty sleeping well if they execute too many depth jumps. This indicates that athletes must be well-prepared physically before doing this type of training.&lt;ref name="Dr. Yuri Verkhoshansky, Natalia Verkhoshansky 2011"/&gt;

Technique of jumping is also very important when executing plyometric exercises. In essence, the athlete goes into a slight squat (crouch) upon landing in which the hip, knee, and ankle joints flex.  The takeoff or jump upward is executed in a sequence initiated by hip-joint extension followed by knee-joint extension which begins during the hip-joint extension.  As the knee-joint extension is taking place, ankle-joint extension begins and is the only action that occurs as the takeoff (breaking contact with the ground) takes place.  All three actions contribute force to the upward jump, but the knee-joint extension is the major contributor.&lt;ref name="Yessis2000" /&gt;

==As simple jumping==

The most common type of plyometrics used in the United States is simple and relatively easy jump exercises executed with little regard to execution time. These jumps are effective for athletes who execute skills in their sport that do not require explosive type muscular contractions. An example is long-distance running in which the runners execute repeat actions of 20 to 30 consecutive jumps and other cyclic-type activities such as leaping for multiple repetitions.&lt;ref name="Yessis2000" /&gt;

Such plyometric jumps are also used as a warm-up for doing explosive plyometric jumps and for initial preparation of the muscles prior to undertaking exercises such as depth jumps.  In essence, they are effective in the early stages of learning how to do plyometric exercises and for preparing the muscles for explosive or quick jumps.  These jumps are similar to those done by youngsters in the playground or in neighborhood games and as such, do not require additional preparation.  Athletes, regardless of their level of expertise, can undertake such jumps in the initial stages of training.

When athletes who have been doing plyometrics without regard to time of execution first attempt to execute explosive plyometrics, they often fail because the time of execution is too long.  This occurs quite often in the depth jump.  The athlete usually sinks (drops) too low which takes too long to make the transition from the eccentric to the concentric contraction.  As a result, the exercise becomes a jump-strength exercise and not a true plyometric one.

Jump technique remains the same regardless of whether it is a true plyometric exercise or a jump exercise. The hips, knees, and ankles flex when landing and the joints extend on the upward return. The sequence and overlapping in the sequence is basically the same, beginning with the hip extension, followed by knee extension, and ending with the ankle-plantar flexing.  The major differences in execution are the depth of the landing and the time of executing the switch from the eccentric to the concentric contraction.

Studies have been conducted testing ten various plyometric exercises on overall performance during jumping examined by EMG, power, and ground reaction force (GRF). Of the ten exercises, the single-leg cone hops, box jumps, tuck jumps, and two-legged vertical jumps produced the highest EMG values, alluding to greater motor recruitment. Power was examined in dumbbell jumps, depth jumps, countermovement jumps, squat jumps, and tuck jumps which all produced the higher power scale readings. In terms of athletic performance and training, the plyometric movements that utilize total body vibration produced an overall increase in performance output. A recent study examined two groups using the same plyometric protocol in combination with [[weight training]], one using high loads and the other utilizing small loads, and similar decreases in power were found. This shows that the  plyometric exercises themselves had a greater effect in the decrease in power output rather than the type of weight training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ebben | first1 = W.

==Safety considerations==
Plyometrics have been shown to have benefits for reducing lower extremity injuries in team sports while combined with other neuromuscular training (i.e. strength training, balance training, and stretching). Plyometric exercises involve an increased risk of injury due to the large force generated during training and performance, and should only be performed by well conditioned individuals under supervision. Good levels of [[physical strength]], [[flexibility (anatomy)|flexibility]], and [[proprioception]] should be achieved before beginning plyometric training.

The specified minimum strength requirement varies depending on where the information is sourced and the intensity of the plyometrics being performed. Chu (1998) recommends that a participant be able to perform 50 repetitions of the [[Squat (exercise)|squat exercise]] at 60% of his or her body weight before doing plyometrics. Core (abdomen) strength is also important.

Flexibility is required both for injury prevention and to enhance the effect of the stretch shortening cycle. In fact, some advanced training methods combine plyometrics and intensive stretching in order to both protect the joint and make it more receptive to the plyometric benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Marc De Bremaeker (2013). ''Plyo-Flex''. {{ISBN|978-1938585104}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Proprioception]] is an important component of balance, coordination and agility, which is also required for safe performance of plyometric exercises.

Further safety considerations include:

* Age: should be taken into account for both prepubescent and the elderly because of hormonal changes.
* Technique: a participant must be instructed on proper technique before commencing any plyometric exercise. He or she should be well rested and free of injury in any of the limbs to be exercised.

Plyometrics are not inherently dangerous, but the highly focused and intense movements used in repetition increase the potential level of stress on joints and musculo-tendonous units. Therefore, safety precautions are strong prerequisites to this particular method of exercise. Low-intensity variations of plyometrics are frequently utilized in various stages of injury rehabilitation, indicating that the application of proper technique and appropriate safety precautions can make plyometrics safe and effective for many people.

== Benefits ==

Many professional and Olympic athletes use plyometrics training to improve muscular strength and jumping abilities which therefore increases their power. There are  varying levels of intensity to plyometrics. Another benefit of plyometrics are that you can vary your level of intensity which means anyone looking to improve strength and jumping training can be involved regardless of fitness. With there being so many exercises this means you are less likely to get burned out and have a wide range of exercises to choose from. Another good reason with so many exercises being available are that you can find exercises that don’t require the use of any equipment. It also increases muscular strength and endurance, also increases metabolic rate which increases weight loss and heart rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://health.alot.com/wellness/pros-of-the-plyometrics-workout--1050|title=Pros of the Plyometrics Workout|date=2015-02-18|website=Alot Health|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Loaded plyometrics ==

Plyometric exercises are sometimes performed with an additional load, or weight, added. The weight is held or worn. The additional weight may be in the form of a barbell, trap bar, dumbbells, or weighted vest. For instance, a vertical jump whilst holding a [[Trapbar|trap bar]] or jumping split squats whilst holding dumbbells. In addition, a regular weight lifting exercise is sometimes given a plyometric component, such as is found in a loaded jump squat. Jumping onto boxes or over hurdles whilst holding weights is not recommended for safety reasons. The advantage of loaded plyometric exercises is that they increase the overall force with which the exercise is performed. This can enhance the positive effect of the exercise and further increase the practitioners ability to apply explosive power.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Derek, Kennelly, Steve, 'Equipment' in ''Plyometric Anatomy'', Leeds: Human Kinetics, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Raw Run''' is recognized colloquially within the [[longboarding]] community as a recorded video showcasing the entire descent down a hill, from top to bottom. This is typically done all in one [[take]] to showcase the rider's consistency and skill.

== Notable Examples ==

[[Colorado]] native and longboarder, Zak Maytum,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/2015/09/09/watch-zak-maytum-longboards-near-70-mph-in-colorado/28161/|title = WATCH: Zak Maytum longboards near 70 mph in Colorado|date = September 9, 2015|accessdate = September 9, 2015|website = WATCH: Zak Maytum longboards near 70 mph in Colorado|publisher = The Denver Post|last = Nguyen|first = Joe}}&lt;/ref&gt; made national news when a video of him descending a roadway reportedly achieving 70&amp;nbsp;mph went [[Viral video|viral]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="65011">In an organized [[sports league]], a typical '''season''' is the portion of one [[year]] in which regulated games of the [[sport]] are in session: for example, in [[Major League Baseball]] the season lasts approximately from April to October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/mlb/2014/09/08/2015-mlb-season-schedule-world-series-interleague|title=MLB announces 2015 schedule with April start, October finish|author=Jay Jaffe|date=September 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other [[team sport]]s, like [[association football]] or [[basketball]], it is generally from August or September to May although in some countries - such as Northern Europe or East Asia - the season starts in the spring and finishes in autumn, mainly due to weather conditions encountered during the winter.

A year can often be broken up into several distinct sections (sometimes themselves called seasons). These are: a preseason, a series of exhibition games played for training purposes; a regular season, the main period of the league's competition; the [[postseason]], a playoff tournament played against the league's top teams to determine the league's champion; and the offseason, the time when there is no official competition.

==Regular season==
In sport, the term "regular season" or "home and away season"&lt;ref name="FortFizel2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rodney D. Fort|author2=John Fizel|title=International Sports Economics Comparisons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6mQHaZaDTzAC&amp;pg=PA316|year=2004|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-98032-0|pages=316–}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the sport's [[championship#league system|league competition]]. The regular season is usually similar to a [[Tournament#Group tournaments|group tournament]] format: teams are divided into groups, conferences and/or divisions, and each club plays a set number of games against a set number of opponents. In most countries the league is played in a double round-robin format, where every team plays every other team twice, once at their home venue, and once away at the oppositions venue as visitors. The results over all games are accumulated and when every team has completed its full schedule of games, a winner is declared. 

In North America, the scheduling is different. Rather than every team playing all others twice, teams usually play more games against local rivals than teams in other parts of the country. For example, the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Los Angeles Lakers]] will play the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] (a team within their division, a subdivision of the conference) four times in a regular season, while both will only play the [[Boston Celtics]], who are in the opposite [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]], twice. Part of this is due to the vast geographic distances between some teams in North America—measured in a straight line, Los Angeles is 2,606 miles (4,194 kilometers) from Boston, for instance—and a desire to limit travel expenses.  In the scheduling system used in the [[NFL]], it is possible for two teams to only meet every four years, and to only have 2 common opponents in a season. [[Major League Baseball]] has the most uneven schedules of all the four major North American sports. In MLB the conferences are called leagues instead, but have exactly the same effect as [[athletic conference|conferences]] (as with all [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|North American major leagues]], leagues, conferences and division are not based on skill, but instead geography, history and rivalries). Teams play 19 games against each of teams in their own division each year but will only play 20 games total against all of the teams in the other league. Because each of the interleague matchups is part of a 3-game series or a 2-game series, teams will play no games at all against most teams from the other league. They play 6 of the 15 teams in the other league, a historically high number (until 1997, [[interleague play]] was limited to exhibition matches and the postseason [[World Series]], and thus MLB teams did not play the other league's teams at all).

In Australia, the two largest football leagues, the [[Australian Football League|AFL]] ([[Australian rules football]]) and [[National Rugby League|NRL]] ([[rugby league]]), both grew out of competitions held within a single city (respectively Melbourne and Sydney) and only began expanding to the rest of the country when inexpensive air travel made a national league possible. These leagues use a single [[league table|table]] instead of being split into divisions. The term "home and away season" is sometimes used instead of regular season.

Many football leagues in Latin America have a very different system. Because most Latin American countries never had a football cup competition, they instead split their season into two parts, typically known as the [[Apertura and Clausura]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "opening" and "closing"). Most countries that use this system, Argentina being one notable example, crown separate league champions for each part of the season, using only league play. A few others, such as Uruguay, crown one champion at the end of a playoff involving top teams from each half of the season. Mexico operates its Apertura and Clausura as separate competitions that both end in playoffs. Brazil have a different system, the season starts with the state championships in January (every Brazilian state have his own championship), these state championships ends in April. The [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A]] itself starts in May and ends in early December, and is played in a double round-robin format in the same way as the European championships.

A system similar to the Apertura and Clausura developed independently in [[Philippine Basketball Association|Philippine professional basketball]], with formerly two, now three tournaments (called "conferences") in one season, with each conference divided into an "elimination round" (the regular season) and the playoffs in the North American sense. Winning the playoffs is the ultimate goal of every team for every conference; while there is no season championship, [[Grand Slam (PBA)|winning all conferences within a single season]] is rare and has only happened five times since 1975, with the two most recent examples occurring in [[1996 Alaska Milkmen season|1996]] and [[2013–14 San Mig Super Coffee Mixers season|2013–14]]. The elimination round and playoffs setup has permeated down to the local level and in most team sports, although seasons are not divided into conferences.

==Postseason==
{{Main|Playoffs}}

Many sports leagues have playoffs or "finals" that occur after the regular season is complete. A subset of the teams enter into a playoff [[tournament]], usually a [[knockout tournament]], generally a pre-determined number with better overall records (more wins, fewer losses) during the regular season. There are many variations used to determine the champion, the league's top prize. In many of these leagues, winning the league's top prize at the conclusion of the postseason is more important than winning the regular season. This includes the [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|five major U.S. sports leagues]] ([[Super Bowl]], [[Stanley Cup Finals]], [[NBA Finals]], [[World Series]] and [[MLS Cup]]), the major Australian sports ([[NBL Grand Final]], [[A-League Grand Final]], [[AFL Grand Final]] and [[NRL Grand Final]]) and the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]]'s [[Grey Cup]].

European leagues have also started holding playoffs after a double round-robin "regular season". The [[Football League]] started its [[Football League play-offs|promotion playoffs]] in 1987, with the third up to the sixth-ranked teams participating for the final promotion berth (the two top teams are automatically promoted). Elsewhere, relegation playoffs are also held to determine which teams would be relegated to the lower leagues. One prominent top-level football league, the [[Eredivisie]] of the Netherlands, uses two different playoffs—one for relegation purposes, and the other to determine one of the league's entrants in the following season's [[UEFA Europa League]]. In [[Superleague Greece]], which currently has two places in the [[UEFA Champions League]] and three in the Europa League, the teams that finish second through fifth in the regular season enter a home-and-away "playoff" mini-league. Since one Europa League place is reserved for the country's cup winner, only three of the four teams are guaranteed a place in the next season's European competitions (unless both the cup winner and runner-up are already qualified for Europe by other means). The playoff determines the country's second Champions League participant, and the points at which the two or three Europa League entrants join that competition. Conversely, some leagues like the [[Premier League]] do not hold a postseason, and therefore these leagues' champions and relegation are instead based on the regular season records.

Although rugby union did not become professional until 1995, that sport has a long history of playoffs, primarily in France and the Southern Hemisphere. The French national championship, now known as [[Top 14]], staged a championship final in its first season of 1892, first used more than one round of playoffs in 1893, and has continuously operated a playoff system (except during the two World Wars) since 1899. South Africa's [[Currie Cup]] has determined its champions by playoffs since 1968, and New Zealand's [[National Provincial Championship]], the top level of which is now known as the [[Mitre 10 Cup]], has used playoffs since its creation in 1976. Argentina's [[Nacional de Clubes]] has determined its champion by playoffs since its inception in 1993. Currently, two separate competitions feed into the Nacional, the [[Torneo de la URBA]] (for Buenos Aires clubs, held since 1899) and [[Torneo del Interior]] (for the rest of the country); both use playoffs to determine their champions. [[Super Rugby]], involving regional franchises from Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa and national franchises in Argentina and Japan, has used playoffs to determine its champions since its creation as Super 12 in 1996.

By contrast, other European countries were slow to adopt playoffs in rugby union. The [[Premiership Rugby|English Premiership]] only began playoffs in [[1999–2000 English Premiership (rugby union)|1999–2000]], and did not use them to determine the league champion until [[2002-03 English Premiership (rugby union)|2002-03]]. The Celtic League, now known as [[Pro14]], resisted a playoff system even longer; its champions were determined solely by league play from its inception in [[2001–02 Celtic League|2001–02]] until playoffs began in [[2009–10 Celtic League|2009–10]].

When the UEFA Champions League reformatted in 1993, it added a "knockout stage" involving four teams that finished at the top two places in their respective groups. Like North American sports leagues, this setup prevented some participants from facing each other, necessitating a two-round knockout stage to determine the champions. It has since been expanded to the 4-round knockout stage today. The [[Copa Libertadores]] has applied a knockout stage since the 1988 tournament, expanding to the current four-round format next season. All intercontinental club football competitions now feature a knockout stage.

==Off-season==
The '''off-season''', '''vacation time''', or '''close season''' is the time of year when there is no official competition. Although upper management continues to work, the athletes will take much [[Annual leave|vacation]] time off. Also, various events such as drafts, [[transfer (football)|transfers]] and important off-season [[free agent]] signings occur. Generally, most athletes stay in shape during the off-season in preparation for the next season. Certain new rules in the league may be made during this time, and will become enforced during the next regular season.

As most countries which have a league in a particular sport will operate their regular season at roughly the same time as the others, international tournaments may be arranged during the off season.

For example, most European football league club competitions run from July or August to May, subsequently major international competitions such as the [[FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA European Football Championship]] are organised to occur in June and July.

===Summary===
{|class=wikitable
|-
!Sport !! Duration
|-
|American football || Originally football was played only in the fall, but for many years the season has extended from late summer through early to mid-winter.

* The 16-game [[NFL]] regular season currently begins the first [[NFL Kickoff Game|Thursday]] in September (after a month of exhibition games) and ends 17 weeks later around [[New Year's Day]].  The playoffs culminate with the [[Super Bowl]] on the first Sunday in February.
* The college season begins the last week in August.  The regular season ends in late November, with playoff and [[bowl games]] throughout December and early January. 
* [[indoor American football|Indoor football]], past professional leagues such as the [[United States Football League|USFL]] and [[XFL]], and some women's and amateur leagues play in the February to August season.
|-
|Association football || Usually August to May in the Northern Hemisphere, and February to November in the Southern Hemisphere. Exceptions are generally for one of two reasons:
* In some northern countries with severe winter weather (such as the United States, Norway, and Sweden), the season is contested within a calendar year (roughly March to November) to avoid the worst weather.
** However, other leagues use winter breaks to avoid most of the coldest days to prevent players suffering from hypothermia.
* Some countries, primarily in Latin America, use a split season, known as [[Apertura and Clausura]]. The traditional association football season from August to May is divided in two sections per season, each with its own champion. Apertura and Clausura are the Spanish words for "opening" and "closing". In French-speaking Haiti, these are known as the Ouverture and the Fermeture, while in English-speaking Belize, they are respectively the Opening and Closing seasons. The North American Soccer League (NASL) adopted a split season in 2013; the season is divided into a Spring Championship and Fall Championship.
* In some countries where soccer competes with locally more popular [[football]] codes (i.e. Major League Soccer in the U.S., A-League in Australia), the season is arranged so as to minimize the time that it is in conflict with the more popular code(s). This arrangement also eases scheduling concerns regarding venues used for multiple football codes. However, in the case of the United States' MLS, their regular seasons can conflict with major tournaments such as the Gold Cup and FIFA World Cup due to the demand of the league's best national players to participate in the national squad.
(See [[Domestic association football season]] for details.)
|-
|Australian rules football || March to late August, with finals series extending up to late September or early October.
|-
|Baseball || April to early October, with playoffs extending up to early November. The Australian Baseball League runs from November to early February, with playoffs extending up to late February.
|-
|Basketball || In most countries, late October to mid-April, with playoffs extending up to mid-June. The three major exceptions to this rule are:
* The U.S. college basketball season begins in mid-November. The regular season ends in the first days of March, followed by conference tournaments and then national championship tournaments that run into early April.
* The Philippine Basketball Association has a unique calendar. Its season runs from early October to August, and is divided into "conferences"—not the North American concept of subgroupings within a larger competition, but rather separate competitions involving the same set of teams, similar to football's [[Apertura and Clausura]] in Latin America. The season was divided into three conferences from 1975 to 2003. It then transitioned to a two-conference season in 2004, and also changed to a season spanning two calendar years, with the transition completed in the 2004–05 season. The PBA returned to a three-conference season effective in 2010–11. The season starts with the Philippine Cup, restricted to Filipino players, followed by two other tournaments in which teams can field one non-Filipino, the Commissioner's and Governors Cups.
* The WNBA season is scheduled during the offseason of its parent league, the NBA. When the league was launched, all of its teams were owned by NBA teams and generally played in the same arenas as their NBA counterparts; however, this has changed over time. The scheduling also allows many WNBA players to participate in overseas leagues, primarily in Europe, Australia, and China, during the traditional basketball season.
|-
|Canadian football || July to late October, with playoffs extending into November.
|-
|Cricket || Year-round. Domestic seasons typically held in the driest period of the year—summer in temperate climates, dry season in tropical climates.
|-
|Golf || Year-round
|-
|Ice hockey || Early October to mid-April, with playoffs extending up to early June. The three major exceptions to this rule are:
* The U.S. men's college hockey season begins in early October. The regular season ends in late February or early March, followed by conference tournaments and then a national championship tournament that runs into mid-April.  The women's season typically begins and ends two or three weeks earlier than the men's.
* The KHL regular season begins in early September and ends in late February. The playoffs run from March to mid-April.
* The Australian Ice Hockey League's season runs from April to mid-August, with playoffs extending up to late August.
|-
|Motor racing || Year-round, but generally concentrated from March to October. NASCAR runs from mid-February to late September, with playoffs extending up to late November.
|-
|Rugby league || Late February to October in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.
|-
|Rugby union || September to late May, sometimes the first weekend in June, in the Northern Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, Super Rugby starts in February and ends in early July in [[Rugby World Cup|World Cup]] years and mid-August in other years. Domestic competitions in [[Mitre 10 Cup|New Zealand]] and [[Currie Cup|South Africa]] overlap slightly with the Super Rugby season, starting in July and ending in October or November. In [[National Rugby Championship|Australia]], the domestic competition does not overlap at all with Super Rugby, instead beginning in August and ending in early November.
|-
|Swimming || Year-round
|-
|Tennis || Year-round

The '''serpentine system''' is a method employed in the organization of a [[competition]] to define the [[Single-elimination tournament#Seeding|seeded]] teams and arrange them in pools. The ''n'' ranked teams that will be involved in the [[tournament]] are distributed in ''m'' pools according to the following [[algorithm]]:

{| border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" style="{ font-size:smaller; }"
|- bgcolor="#efefef" 
!Pool 1!!Pool 2!! . . . !!Pool ''m'' − 1!!Pool ''m''
|- align="center"
|1||2|| . . . ||''m'' − 1||''m''
|- align="center"
|2''m''||2''m'' − 1|| . . . ||''m'' + 2||''m'' + 1
|- align="center"
|2''m'' + 1||2''m'' + 2|| . . . ||3''m'' − 1||3''m''
|- align="center"
|...||&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;
|}

For instance, 12 teams would be organized in four-team pools, according to the serpentine   system, as follows:

{| border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" style="font-size:smaller"
|- bgcolor="#efefef"
!Pool 1!!Pool 2!!Pool 3
|- align="center"
|1||2||3
|- align="center"
|6||5||4
|- align="center"
|7||8||9
|- align="center"
|12||11||10
|}

To improve competitivity, this method is sometimes used in conjunction with the [[Drawing straws|drawing of lots]] method: the serpentine system is used only for some of the teams involved in a competition ("seeds"); the rest is distributed in pools following a drawing of lots.

'''''Sit and Be Fit''''' is a television exercise program for older adults and anyone needing slow gentle movement. The program is broadcast throughout the United States, distributed to public television stations (although not by the [[Thirteen New York]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sitandbefit.org/index.php |title=Sit and Be Fit homepage |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519112613/http://www.sitandbefit.org/index.php |archivedate=2007-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sit and Be Fit programs are also available on DVD.

The series was created in 1987 by [[Mary Ann Wilson, RN|Mary Ann Wilson]], a registered nurse specializing in the field of post-polio rehabilitation and geriatrics.

Wilson recognized the need for functional exercise, especially for moderately active seniors or those managing chronic conditions or needing rehabilitation from strokes, heart attacks or other injuries.

The show's mission statement is: "''Sit and Be Fit'' is committed to improving the quality of life of older adults and  physically limited individuals through safe, effective exercises that are available through television, videos, personal appearances, classes, seminars, books, and the Internet.'' The show ''actively promotes functional fitness, healing, and independence, and is an effective resource for professionals in aging and fitness."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sitandbefit.org/index.php?p=14 Mission Statement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928135350/http://www.sitandbefit.org/index.php?p=14 |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==

It has been broadcast since 1987 on over 100 public television stations throughout the [[United States]]. The first public television station that agreed to carry her show was [[KSPS-TV]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sitandbefit.com/docs/Mary_Ann_Biography.pdf About Mary Ann]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the corporation filed for a non-profit status, and was granted the right to be a "501(c)(3) charitable organization."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sitandbefit.org/index.php?p=14 Non Profit Status history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928135350/http://www.sitandbefit.org/index.php?p=14 |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14438">'''The contested judgment of taekwondo of 2010 Asian Games''', also called "'''Sockgate'''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2010/11/18/2003488785|title=SOCKGATE: Taiwanese disqualified in sensor spat|publisher=The Taipei Times|date=November 18, 2010|accessdate=November 21, 2010}}&lt;br&gt;Note: Also called "Sockgate" by at least one local English-language media source.&lt;/ref&gt; is a dispute at the [[2010 Asian Games]] on November 17. [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] [[taekwondo]] [[sportsperson|athlete]] [[Yang Shu-chun]] was disqualified with twelve seconds remaining in the first round due to "unauthorized" (disputed) sensors on her [[sock]]s.

==The judgment==
Yang was facing [[Vietnam]]ese opponent Vu Thi Hau in the first round of the [[flyweight]] division (under 49 kilogram) of the Asian Games taekwondo competition in [[Guangzhou]], [[Guangdong]], [[People's Republic of China|China]] on November 17, 2010, when she was accused of using the "unauthorized" sensors. During the pre-match testing of equipment, the referee discovered that Yang had two extra sensors on the heels of each sock, which she was asked to remove. She fought without the two additional sensors on her socks.

However, with twelve seconds remaining in the first round of the bout, when Yang was leading at an advantage of 9–0, [[Asian Taekwondo Union]] vice-president Zhao Lei ({{lang|zh-cn|赵磊}}) of [[People's republic of China|China]] instructed Filipino referee Fernandez S. Estanislaoto&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gz2010.cn/info/ENG_ENG/ZB/ZBB101A_TK@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ENG_number=101835.html FERNANDEZ Stephen Estanislao – Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; to call Yang over to the side and inspected her heels. Finding nothing, the referee then called for the match referee to bring over the two sensors that had already been removed and kept under the chair that Yang's coach was sitting on. Following that, Zhao and the referee had a brief discussion, and the match referee disqualified Yang and awarded Vu a 12–0 victory.&lt;ref name="taipeitimes1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2010/11/19/2003488876|title=SOCKGATE: Public cries foul in Games row|publisher=The Taipei Times|date=November 19, 2010|accessdate=November 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The controversy==
[[Chinese Taipei]] representatives at the taekwondo venue immediately pointed out that the equipment was certified and that both fighters passed a pre-match inspection. Following the disqualification, Yang and her coach both protested on the mat for about an hour. The [[World Taekwondo Federation]] (WTF) authorities then gave the ultimatum for them to leave, or they would suspend every Chinese Taipei taekwondo member in the Game. The WTF Secretary-General Yang Jin-suk initially did not reveal the reason why Yang was disqualified and told the press that it was for the protection of the athlete's personal privacy, but later it was revealed the reason was for the sensors on her socks. Secretary-General later said, "It was clearly a manipulative move with the intent of cheating, and that's the reason why the individual was disqualified."&lt;ref name="violation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2010/11/19/2003488877/1|title=SOCKGATE:World taekwondo official insists Yang broke rules|publisher=The Taipei Times|date=November 19, 2010|accessdate=November 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Secretary-General of the WTF, there are two sorts of sensor socks for taekwondo. It is specified that only the newer type is allowed to be used in the 2010 Asian Games, because the older type of sensors are fixed by [[velcro]], which allows athletes to easily add new sensors themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2010.163.com/10/1118/08/6LOP5MBE00864IPP.html|script-title=zh:世界跆拳道联合会秘书长:杨淑君赛前已遭到警告|language=zh|publisher=[[NetEase]]|date=November 18, 2010|accessdate=November 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sensors on the newer type are fixed by stitching and have no possibility to be altered by illegal methods, but the newer type have no sensors on the heel.

Yang's coach, Liu Tsung-da ({{lang|zh-tw|劉聰達}}), said the inspector for the match asked Yang to change her socks due to poor signal response before the match. Yang put on another set of older velcro socks and passed the equipment inspection. During the match, the sensors on the heel area had already been removed, which should not affect the scoring record. Right after the judgment, Liu asked for the testimony of the inspector and the surveillance video as evidence, but the demands were all rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=馬鈺龍、陳東旭|url=http://udn.com/NEWS/NATIONAL/NAT2/5985555.shtml|script-title=zh:偷貼有錄影？ 楊淑君：拿出來|publisher=United Daily News Net|date=2010-11-20|accessdate=2010-11-26|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The equipment supplier of the Chinese Taipei team said they had never received an official notification from the WTF about suspending the velcro type socks before the Asian Games. There were many of the older type being used in other matches of different weight classes, but those athletes didn't suffer any punishment before or after their matches. According to the WTF official instruction for taekwondo athletes, the former type is still legal in any international games until [[2012 Summer Olympics|London Olympics in 2012]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=丁泰翔|url=http://tvbstv.com/news/news_list.asp?no=chen198720101119191153|script-title=zh:「楊淑君沒貼錯」　廠商示電子襪說明書|publisher=[[TVBS]]|date=2010-11-20|accessdate=2010-11-26|language=zh|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717114545/http://tvbstv.com/news/news_list.asp?no=chen198720101119191153|archivedate=2011-07-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=E-Apple|url=http://tw.nextmedia.com/rnews/article/ArtID/91402/IssueID/20101118/SecID/107|script-title=zh:廣州亞運》貼的位置不對！楊淑君失格確定|publisher=[[Apple Daily (Taiwan)|Apple Daily]]|date=2010-11-18|accessdate=2010-11-26|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two "unauthorized" extra sensors proclaimed to be found by the Game officials belong to the original design of the older type by a Korean equipment manufacturer, which is the only manufacturer authorized by the WTF officials for the 2010 Asian Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.budomart.com.tw/img/20101120q0120555.jpg|title=經緯武道之聲明稿 (The declaration from the equipment supplier)|publisher=經緯武道館|accessdate=2010-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=黃邱倫|url=http://news.chinatimes.com/focus/0,5243,50107297x112010112100117,00.html|script-title=zh:賽事主任 曹濤：領隊會議未提禁用貼片|publisher=[[China Times]]|date=2010-11-21|accessdate=2010-11-26|language=zh|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124025614/http://news.chinatimes.com/focus/0%2C5243%2C50107297x112010112100117%2C00.html|archivedate=2010-11-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political reaction==
Political reaction in the Republic of China (Taiwan) came swiftly, with politicians on both sides of the political spectrum rushing to Yang's defense. The [[Kuomintang]] [[Legislative Yuan|legislator]] [[Huang Chih-hsiung]] ({{lang|zh-hant|黃志雄}}), himself an [[Taekwondo at the 2004 Summer Olympics|Olympic taekwondo silver medalist]] at the [[2004 Athens Olympic Games]], stated "the decision was inconceivable and ridiculous." [[Premier of the Republic of China|Premier]] [[Wu Den-yih]] ({{lang|zh-hant|吳敦義}}) is cited as saying, "From the current information we have, our athlete Yang Shu-chun was wronged. If it is proven that the ruling was unfair, the Asian Games Organizing Committee has to shoulder the biggest responsibility." The [[Sports Affairs Council]] demanded an explanation from the [[Asian Taekwondo Union]] regarding the disqualification.

The [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) legislator Pan Men-an ({{lang|zh-hant|潘孟安}}) claimed at a press conference that the accusation by the Game officials that Yang had cheated was an "insult to everybody around the country," and charged that, "the responsibility should fall on the people that conducted the equipment checks."&lt;ref name="taipeitimes1"/&gt;

However, not all was completely peaceful between the two political sides, as the DPP leaders accused the government of a slow response. The DPP Legislator Chiu Yi-ying ({{lang|zh-hant|邱議瑩}}) complained that: "A large number of officials attended the Games, but all they have done so far is to show up at and take part in the awarding ceremonies when our athletes win. When Yang was disqualified, what did they do? Nothing."

[[Tsai Ing-wen]] ({{lang|zh-hant|蔡英文}}), then-current [[chairperson]] of the DPP and [[Republic of China municipal elections, 2010|a candidate for mayor]] of [[New Taipei City]] in 2010, released a statement saying: "This government has always deferred to China and hasn't emphasized our attitudes enough, especially on [[Sovereignty of Taiwan|sovereignty issues]]." She further stated, "As a result, we think that it is regrettable that frontline officials haven't been protesting strongly enough about this incident."

==Public reaction==
Shortly after the disqualification, Taiwanese [[netizen]]s voiced their dissatisfaction with the judgment. Soon, several [[Facebook group]]s in support of Yang were posted, some with hundreds of thousands of followers. On the pages, outcry toward both [[South Korea]] and [[People's Republic of China|China]] was rampant, with many conjecturing a conspiracy, as Yang was regarded as the primary rival to China's gold medal favorite, [[Wu Jingyu]] ({{lang|zh-hans|吴静钰}}), the eventual winner of the gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2010/11/19/2003488919|title=SOCKGATE: Netizens voice rage at Games|publisher=Taipei Times|date=November 19, 2010|accessdate=November 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conspiracy theorized that Zhao Le ({{lang|zh-hans|赵磊}}), Wu Jingyu's long-time mentor, was the invisible hand that deliberately forced Yang's ouster to pave the way for Wu's gold medal.

The [[Taekwondo at the 2006 Asian Games|2006 Asian Games]] gold medalist [[Su Li-wen]] ({{lang|zh-hant|蘇麗文}}) came out in support of Yang in her blog, saying that she has never heard of such a ridiculous accusation and pointed out that eight of Yang's nine points were manually scored without the benefit of the foot sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Cheng Yu-chia|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2010/11/19/2003488922|title=SOCKGATE: Former champion comes out in support of Yang|publisher=[[Taipei Times]]|date=2010-11-19|accessdate=2010-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yang's father, Yang Chin-hsing ({{lang|zh-hant|楊進興}}), remarked, "The whole thing is utterly unacceptable", and told the press that Yang had spent ten months preparing for this competition and that he suspected that China was behind this incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tsai Wei-chi|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2010/11/19/2003488920|title=SOCKGATE: Athlete's father demands justice after disqualification|publisher=[[Taipei Times]]|date=2010-11-19|accessdate=2010-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Asian Taekwondo Union published a misleading article titled "Shocking Act of Deception by Chinese Taipei" on its website, attempting to deflect South Korea of blame of the incident. The homepage of the website was then hacked by Taiwanese [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]]s who added hostile criticism. Later, the homepage was restored, and the misleading article was removed. The Union has reportedly blocked Taiwanese IPs from accessing its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nownews.com/2010/11/22/339-2666586.htm|language=zh|title=亞跆盟官網使賤招？ 用防火牆封鎖台灣 IP 騙說遭駭！ &amp;#124; 3C新聞 &amp;#124; NOWnews 今日新聞網|publisher=Nownews.com|date=|accessdate=2010-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-Korean protests in Taiwan===
{{Further|Anti-Korean sentiment#In Taiwan}}
Since this is not the first time that Taiwanese athletes have faced controversial judgments in international games, netizens rallied to [[boycott]] Korean merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=陳威廷、楊忠翰|url=http://tw.nextmedia.com/applenews/article/art_id/32973566/IssueID/20101119|script-title=zh:35萬人挺楊 批韓國卑鄙|publisher=[[Apple Daily (Taiwan)|Apple Daily]]|date=2010-11-19|accessdate=2010-11-26|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; A legislator candidate even led the congregation to protest and burn the [[flag of South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=黃奕群、許家瑜|url=http://www.ctitv.com.tw/news_video_c13v22668.html|script-title=zh:"少女時代道歉都無效"!　反韓聲浪高漲|publisher=[[CTi News]]|date=2010-11-18|accessdate = 2010-11-26|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; One Taipei citizen threw eggs at a Korean immigration school as a protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=E-Apple|url=http://tw.nextmedia.com/applenews/article/art_id/32978151/IssueID/20101121|script-title=zh:蛋洗韓國學校 家長很不安|publisher=[[Apple Daily (Taiwan)|Apple Daily]]|date=2010-11-21|accessdate=2010-11-26|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few restaurants and [[Taxicab|taxi]] drivers announced, "No Service to Koreans."

==Verdict==
On December 21, 2010, Yang was given a three months' suspension for protesting her disqualification during the 2010 Asian Games by the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF). Her coach, Liu Tsung-ta was given a 20 months' suspension while Chinese Taipei Taekwondo Association (CTTA) was fined US$50,000 for "negligence and wrongdoing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wang|first=Chris|title=Taiwan taekwondo athlete Yang suspended for three months (update)|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/ShowNews/WebNews_Detail.aspx?Type=aALL&amp;ID=201012210039|accessdate=2010-12-22|newspaper=Focus Taiwan News Channel|date=2010-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Youth-soccer-indiana.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Sport in [[childhood]]. [[Association football]], shown above, is a [[team sport]] which also provides opportunities to nurture [[physical fitness]] and [[social actions|social interaction]] skills.]]

'''Sport''' ([[British English]]) or '''sports''' ([[American English]]) includes all forms of [[Competition|competitive]] [[physical activity]] or [[game]]s which,&lt;ref name=sportaccord&gt;{{cite web |publisher=SportAccord |url=http://www.sportaccord.com/en/members/index.php?idIndex=32&amp;idContent=14881 |title=Definition of sport |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028112912/http://www.sportaccord.com/en/members/index.php?idIndex=32&amp;idContent=14881 |archivedate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; through casual or organised participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants, and in some cases, [[entertainment]] for spectators.&lt;ref name=council&gt;{{cite web |last=Council of Europe |title=The European sport charter |url=https://wcd.coe.int/wcd/ViewDoc.jsp?id=206451 |accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in [[team]]s or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as [[racing]], many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest (a ''match'') is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a tie game; others provide [[tie-breaking methods]] to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of contests may be arranged in a [[tournament]] producing a [[champion]]. Many [[sports league]]s make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular [[sports season]], followed in some cases by [[playoffs]].

Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical [[athleticism]] or physical [[dexterity]], with the largest major competitions such as the [[Olympic Games]] admitting only sports meeting this definition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/sports |title=List of Summer and Winter Olympic Sports and Events |publisher=The Olympic Movement}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other organisations such as the [[Council of Europe]] using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports.&lt;ref name=council/&gt; However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as [[mind sport]]s. The International Olympic Committee (through [[Association of IOC Recognised International Sports Federations|ARISF]]) recognises both [[chess]] and [[Contract bridge|bridge]] as ''bona fide'' sports, and [[SportAccord]], the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess, [[draughts]] (checkers), [[Go (game)|Go]] and [[xiangqi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=SportAccord |title=World Mind Games |url=http://www.sportaccord.com/en/multi-sports-games/index.php?idIndex=35&amp;idContent=658 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508021848/http://www.sportaccord.com/en/multi-sports-games/index.php?idIndex=35&amp;idContent=658 |archivedate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=SportAccord |title=Members |url=http://www.sportaccord.com/en/members/index.php?idContent=644&amp;idIndex=32 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507073823/http://www.sportaccord.com/en/members/index.php?idContent=644&amp;idIndex=32 |archivedate=7 May 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.&lt;ref name=sportaccord/&gt;

Sport is usually governed by a set of [[regulation of sport|rules]] or [[tradition|customs]], which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring [[goal (sport)|goals]] or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.

Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in [[sports journalism|sport news]]. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with [[spectator sport]] drawing large crowds to [[sport venue]]s, and reaching wider audiences through [[broadcasting of sports events|broadcasting]]. [[Sport betting]] is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.

According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21585012-sportswomen-are-beginning-score-more-commercial-goalsbut-they-still-have-lot-ground |title=Women in sport: Game, sex and match |work=The Economist |date=7 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world's most accessible and practised sport is [[running]], while [[association football]] is its most popular spectator sport.&lt;ref name=wa/&gt;

==Meaning and usage==
===Etymology===
The word "sport" comes from the [[Old French]] ''desport'' meaning "[[leisure]]", with the oldest definition in English from around 1300 being "anything humans find amusing or entertaining".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=sport&amp;searchmode=none |title=sport (n.) |accessdate=20 April 2008 |first=Douglas |last=Harper |work=Online Etymological Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other meanings include gambling and events staged for the purpose of gambling; hunting; and games and diversions, including ones that require exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged |publisher=G&amp;C Merriam Company |location=Springfield, MA |page=2206 |year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roget's defines the noun sport as an "activity engaged in for relaxation and amusement" with synonyms including diversion and recreation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Roget's II: The New Thesaurus, Third Edition |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |url=http://thesaurus.reference.com/browse/sport |year=1995 |isbn=0-618-25414-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nomenclature===
The singular term "sport" is used in most English dialects to describe the overall concept (e.g. "children taking part in sport"), with "sports" used to describe multiple activities (e.g. "football and rugby are the most popular sports in England"). American English uses "sports" for both terms.

===Definition===
{{see also|Game#Definitions}}
[[File:ChessStartingPosition.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|The International Olympic Committee recognises some board games as sports including [[chess]].]]
[[File:Showjumping white horse.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|[[Show jumping]], an [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] sport]]
The precise definition of what separates a sport from other leisure activities varies between sources. The closest to an international agreement on a definition is provided by [[SportAccord]], which is the association for all the largest international sports federations (including [[association football]], [[athletics (sport)|athletics]], [[cycling]], [[tennis]], [[equestrianism|equestrian sports]], and more), and is therefore the ''de facto'' representative of international sport.

SportAccord uses the following criteria, determining that a sport should:&lt;ref name=sportaccord/&gt;
*have an element of competition
*be in no way harmful to any living creature
*not rely on equipment provided by a single supplier (excluding proprietary games such as [[arena football]])
*not rely on any "luck" element specifically designed into the sport.

They also recognise that sport can be primarily physical (such as [[rugby union|rugby]] or [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]]), primarily mind (such as [[chess]] or [[Go (game)|Go]]), predominantly motorised (such as [[Formula 1]] or [[powerboating]]), primarily co-ordination (such as [[cue sports|billiard sports]]), or primarily animal-supported (such as [[equestrian sport]]).&lt;ref name=sportaccord/&gt;

The inclusion of mind sports within sport definitions has not been universally accepted, leading to legal challenges from governing bodies in regards to being denied funding available to sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |title=Judicial review of 'sport' or 'game' decision begins |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34320201 |date=2015-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst SportAccord recognises a small number of mind sports, it is not open to admitting any further mind sports.

There has been an increase in the application of the term "sport" to a wider set of non-physical challenges such as [[video game]]s, also called [[esports]], especially due to the large scale of participation and organised competition, but these are not widely recognised by mainstream sports organisations. According to [[Council of Europe]], European Sports Charter, article 2.i, {{"'}}Sport' means all forms of physical activity which, through casual or organised participation, aim at expressing or improving physical fitness and mental well-being, forming social relationships or obtaining results in competition at all levels."&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe, [https://search.coe.int/cm/Pages/result_details.aspx?ObjectID=09000016804c9dbb Revised European Sports Charter] (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competition===
There are opposing views on the necessity of [[competition]] as a defining element of a sport, with almost all [[professional sport]] involving competition, and governing bodies requiring competition as a prerequisite of recognition by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) or SportAccord.&lt;ref name=sportaccord/&gt;

Other bodies advocate widening the definition of sport to include all physical activity. For instance, the [[Council of Europe]] include all forms of physical exercise, including those competed just for fun.

In order to widen participation, and reduce the impact of losing on less able participants, there has been an introduction of non-competitive physical activity to traditionally competitive events such as school [[sports day]]s, although moves like this are often controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Front |first=Rebecca |work=The Guardian |title=A little competition |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/17/school-sport-competitive-children-achievement-ambition |date=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=ParentDish |title=Why parents hate school sports day |last=Scrimgeour |first=Heidi |date=17 June 2011 |url=http://www.parentdish.co.uk/2011/06/17/why-parents-hate-school-sports-day/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In competitive events, participants are graded or classified based on their "result" and often divided into groups of comparable performance, (e.g. gender, weight and age). The measurement of the result may be objective or subjective, and corrected with "handicaps" or penalties. In a race, for example, the time to complete the course is an objective measurement. In [[gymnastics]] or [[diving (sport)|diving]] the result is decided by a panel of judges, and therefore subjective. There are many shades of judging between boxing and mixed martial arts, where victory is assigned by judges if neither competitor has lost at the end of the match time.

==History==
{{Main article|History of sport}}
[[File:Greek statue discus thrower 2 century aC.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] bronze reduction of [[Myron]]'s [[Discobolos]], 2nd century AD.]]

Artifacts and structures suggest [[sport in China]] as early as 2000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chineseculture.about.com/library/weekly/aa032301a.htm |title=Sports History in China}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gymnastics appears to have been popular in China's ancient past. Monuments to the [[Pharaoh]]s indicate that a number of sports, including swimming and fishing, were well-developed and regulated several thousands of years ago in [[ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ioa.leeds.ac.uk/1980s/84085.htm |title=Mr Ahmed D. Touny (EGY), IOC Member |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029232515/http://www.ioa.leeds.ac.uk/1980s/84085.htm |archivedate=29 October 2006 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Egyptian sports included javelin throwing, high jump, and wrestling. [[Ancient Persia]]n sports such as the traditional [[Iran]]ian martial art of [[Zourkhaneh]] had a close connection to warfare skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kuwait-info.com/newsnew/NewsDetails1.asp?id=78319&amp;dt=10/13/2006&amp;ntype=World |title=Persian warriors |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070326081959/http://www.kuwait-info.com/newsnew/NewsDetails1.asp?id=78319&amp;dt=10%2F13%2F2006&amp;ntype=World |archivedate=26 March 2007 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other sports that originated in ancient Persia are [[polo]] and [[jousting]].

[[File:Bruno Senna 2006 Australian Grand Prix.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|[[Motorsport|Motorised sports]] have appeared since the advent of the modern age.]]
[[File:Goście Intel Extreme Masters (8465481816).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|[[Electronic sports]] are a recent development.]]
A wide range of sports were already established by the time of [[Ancient Greece]] and the military culture and the development of sport in Greece influenced one another considerably. Sport became such a prominent part of their culture that the Greeks created the Olympic Games, which in ancient times were held every four years in a small village in the [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesus]] called [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/ancient/index_uk.asp |title=Ancient Olympic Games}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sports have been increasingly organised and regulated from the time of the ancient Olympics up to the present century. Industrialisation has brought increased [[leisure time]], letting people attend and follow spectator sports and participate in athletic activities. These trends continued with the advent of [[mass media]] and global communication. Professionalism became prevalent, further adding to the increase in sport's popularity, as sports fans followed the exploits of professional athletes&amp;nbsp;– all while enjoying the exercise and competition associated with amateur participation in sports. Since the turn of the 21st&amp;nbsp;century, there has been increasing debate about whether [[transgender]] sportspersons should be able to participate in sport events that conform with their post-transition [[gender identity]].&lt;ref&gt;Sport and the Law: Historical and Cultural Intersections, p 111, Sarah K. Fields - 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fair play==
===Sportsmanship===
{{Main article|Sportsmanship}}
{{See also|Gamesmanship|Winning isn't everything; it's the only thing}}

Sportsmanship is an attitude that strives for fair play, courtesy toward teammates and opponents, ethical behaviour and integrity, and grace in victory or defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=sportsmanship |publisher=Merriam-Webster |title=Sportsmanship}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fish |first1=Joel |last2=Magee |first2=Susan |year=2003 |title=101 Ways to Be a Terrific Sports Parent |publisher=Fireside |page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lacey |first=David |date=10 November 2007 |url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/11/10/it_takes_a_bad_loser_to_become.html |title=It takes a bad loser to become a good winner |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sportsmanship expresses an aspiration or ethos that the activity will be enjoyed for its own sake. The well-known sentiment by sports journalist [[Grantland Rice]], that it's "not that you won or lost but how you played the game", and the modern Olympic creed expressed by its founder [[Pierre de Coubertin]]: "The most important thing... is not winning but taking part" are typical expressions of this sentiment.

===Cheating===
{{see also|Match fixing|cheating}}
Key principles of sport include that the result should not be predetermined, and that both sides should have equal opportunity to win. Rules are in place to ensure fair play, but participants can break these rules in order to gain advantage.

Participants may cheat in order to unfairly increase their chance of winning, or in order to achieve other advantages such as financial gains. The widespread existence of [[gambling]] on the results of sports fixtures creates a motivation for [[match fixing]], where a participant or participants deliberately work to ensure a given outcome rather than simply playing to win.

===Doping and drugs===
{{main article|Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport}}
The competitive nature of sport encourages some participants to attempt to enhance their performance through the use of medicines, or through other means such as [[Blood doping|increasing the volume of blood in their bodies through artificial means]].

All sports recognised by the IOC or SportAccord are required to implement a testing programme, looking for a list of banned drugs, with suspensions or bans being placed on participants who test positive for banned substances.

===Violence===
[[Violence in sports]] involves crossing the line between fair competition and intentional aggressive violence. Athletes, coaches, fans, and parents sometimes unleash violent behaviour on people or property, in misguided shows of loyalty, dominance, anger, or celebration. [[Rioting]] or [[hooliganism]] by fans in particular is a problem at some national and international sporting contests.

==Participation==
===Gender participation===

{{Expand section|date=March 2012}}
{{see also|Women's sports|Women's professional sports|Women's sports in the United States}}
Female participation in sports continues to rise alongside the opportunity for involvement and the value of sports for [[child development]] and [[physical fitness]]. Despite gains during the last three decades, a gap persists in the enrollment figures between male and female players. Female players account for 39% of the total participation in US interscholastic athletics. Gender balance has been accelerating from a 32% increase in 1973–74 to a 63% increase in 1994–95. Hessel (2000).{{Full citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Youth participation===
{{expand section|date=March 2012}}
{{See also|College sport}}
Youth sport presents children with opportunities for fun, socialisation, forming peer relationships, physical fitness, and [[athletic scholarship]]s. Activists for [[education]] and the [[war on drugs]] encourage youth sport as a means to increase [[Participation inequality|educational participation]] and to fight the [[illegal drug trade]]. According to the [[Nationwide Children's Hospital (Columbus)#Research and education|Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital]], the biggest risk for youth sport is death or serious injury including [[concussion]]. These risks come from running, basketball, association football, volleyball, gridiron, gymnastics, and ice hockey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://healthland.time.com/2009/08/04/why-are-more-kids-getting-hurt-in-gym-class/ "Gym class injuries up 150% between 1997 and 2007"], ''Time'', 4 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Youth sport in the US is a $15 billion industry including equipment up to private coaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gregory |first1=Sean |title=How Kids' Sports Became a $15 Billion Industry |url=http://time.com/4913687/how-kids-sports-became-15-billion-industry/ |accessdate=24 August 2017 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disabled participation===
[[File:David Bizet - Marathon de Paris 2014.jpg|thumb|right|A runner gives a friendly tap on the shoulder to a wheelchair racer during the [[Paris Marathon|''Marathon International de Paris'' (Paris Marathon)]] in 2014.]]
{{see also|Disabled sports}}
'''Disabled sports''' also '''adaptive sports''' or '''parasports''', are sports played by persons with a [[disability]], including [[physical disability|physical]] and [[intellectual disabilities]]. As many of these are based on existing sports modified to meet the needs of persons with a disability, they are sometimes referred to as ''adapted sports''. However, not all disabled sports are adapted; several sports that have been specifically created for persons with a disability have no equivalent in able-bodied sports.

===Spectator involvement===
[[File:1906 Athens stadium.jpg|thumb|right|Spectators at the 1906 unofficial Olympic Games]]
{{Main article|Spectator sport}}
The competition element of sport, along with the aesthetic appeal of some sports, result in the popularity of people attending to watch sport being played. This has led to the specific phenomenon of [[spectator sport]].

Both amateur and professional sports attract spectators, both in person at the sport venue, and through broadcast media including [[radio broadcasting|radio]], [[television]] and [[internet]] broadcast. Both attendance in person and viewing remotely can incur a sometimes substantial charge, such as an entrance ticket, or [[pay-per-view]] television broadcast.

It is common for popular sports to attract large broadcast audiences, leading to rival broadcasters bidding large amounts of money for the rights to show certain fixtures. The football [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] attracts a global [[television]] audience of hundreds of millions; the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] [[FIFA World Cup Finals|final]] alone attracted an estimated worldwide audience of well over 700&amp;nbsp;million and the [[2011 Cricket World Cup Final]]  attracted an estimated audience of 135&amp;nbsp;million in India alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=135 mn saw World Cup final: TAM |date=10 April 2011 |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/CorporateNews/135-mn-saw-World-Cup-final-TAM/Article1-683623.aspx |newspaper=Hindustan Times |accessdate=1 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803013151/http://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/CorporateNews/135-mn-saw-World-Cup-final-TAM/Article1-683623.aspx |archivedate=3 August 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], the championship game of the [[National Football League|NFL]], the [[Super Bowl]], has become one of the most watched television broadcasts of the year.&lt;ref name="SB15"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/super-bowl-sets-viewership-record-161138960.html |title=Super Bowl XLIX was the most-viewed television program in U.S. history |publisher=Yahoo Sports |date=2 February 2015 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cbc8df2a-aafd-11e4-81bc-00144feab7de.html |title=Super Bowl most watched television show in US history |work=Financial Times |date=2 February 2015 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues and considerations==
===Amateur and professional===
[[File:OHL-Hockey-Plymouth-Whalers-vs-Saginaw-Spirit.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Modern sports have complex [[Regulation of sport|rules]] and are highly organised.]]
{{See also|professional sport|amateur sport}}
Sport can be undertaken on an amateur, professional or semi-professional basis, depending on whether participants are incentivised for participation (usually through payment of a [[wage]] or [[salary]]). Amateur participation in sport at lower levels is often called "grassroots sport".&lt;ref name="council"/&gt;&lt;ref name="White Paper"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=European Commission |title=The White Paper on Sport |url=http://ec.europa.eu/sport/white-paper/index_en.htm |accessdate=11 July 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916202200/http://ec.europa.eu/sport/white-paper/index_en.htm |archivedate=16 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of [[spectator sport]] as a recreation for non-participants has led to sport becoming a major business in its own right, and this has incentivised a high paying [[professional sport]] culture, where high performing participants are rewarded with pay far in excess of average wages, which can run into millions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Sports Illustrated |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/specials/fortunate50-2011/index.html |title=Fortunate 50 2011 |last=Freedman |first=Jonah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sports, or individual competitions within a sport, retain a policy of allowing only [[amateur sport]]. The [[Olympic Games]] started with a principle of amateur competition with those who practised a sport professionally considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practised it merely as a hobby.&lt;ref name=OIdeology&gt;{{cite book |last=Eassom |first=Simon |title=Critical Reflections on Olympic Ideology |year=1994 |location=Ontario |publisher=The Centre for Olympic Studies |pages=120–123 |isbn=0-7714-1697-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1971, Olympic athletes were allowed to receive compensation and sponsorship,&lt;ref name="InfoPlease"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/olympic-athletes.html |title=Olympic Athletes |publisher=Info Please |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from 1986, the IOC decided to make all professional athletes eligible for the Olympics,&lt;ref name="InfoPlease"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/22/opinion/greene-olympics-amateurs/ |title=What changed the Olympics forever |publisher=CNN |date=23 July 2012 |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the exceptions of [[boxing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/13894/olympic-boxing-must-remain-amateur-despite-moves-to-turn-it-professional-states-warren- |title=Olympic boxing must remain amateur despite moves to turn it professional states Warren |publisher=Inside the Games |date=13 August 2011 |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=njefAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA400&amp;lpg=PA400&amp;dq=only+amateur+boxers+at+olympics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0jbCDYw8R1&amp;sig=6_-OvLg15u_iGOSTCS6lxm8dedw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwATgKahUKEwi6xNfgiI3GAhVRBNsKHf_HAJ0#v=onepage&amp;q=only%20amateur%20boxers%20at%20olympics&amp;f=false |title=Historical Dictionary of Boxing |last1=Grasso |first1=John |date=2013 |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrestling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1529280-olympic-wrestling-is-important-for-pro-wrestlers-and-its-fans |title=Olympic Wrestling Is Important for Pro Wrestling and Its Fans |publisher=Bleacher Report |date=14 February 2013 |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2WYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=only+amateur+wrestlers+at+olympics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=a7VnB9vii1&amp;sig=E0kjCilT-UbvD94prBgV1LIgmSE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwB2oVChMI9NP2pomNxgIVoQrbCh2kbQC_#v=onepage&amp;q=only%20amateur%20wrestlers%20at%20olympics&amp;f=false |title=Boys' Life |date=August 1988 |page=24 |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology===
Technology plays an important part in modern sport. With it being a necessary part of some sports (such as motorsport), it is used in others to improve performance. Some sports also use it to allow off-field decision making.
 
[[Sports science]] is a widespread academic discipline, and can be applied to areas including athlete performance, such as the use of video analysis to fine-tune technique, or to equipment, such as improved [[running shoe]]s or [[competitive swimwear]]. [[Sports engineering]] emerged as a discipline in 1998 with an increasing focus not just on materials design but also the use of technology in sport, from analytics and big data to [[wearable technology]].&lt;ref name="Gaining Steam in Sports Technology"&gt;{{cite web |title=Gaining Steam in Sports Technology |url=https://alum.mit.edu/pages/sliceofmit/2014/06/17/mit-steam-sports-technology/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714150052/https://alum.mit.edu/pages/sliceofmit/2014/06/17/mit-steam-sports-technology/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 July 2014 |website=Slice of MIT |accessdate=3 January 2015 |ref=Slice of MIT}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to control the impact of technology on fair play, governing bodies frequently have specific rules that are set to control the impact of technical advantage between participants. For example, in 2010, full-body, non-textile swimsuits were banned by [[FINA]], as they were enhancing swimmers' performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/swimming/8161867.stm |title=Hi-tech suits banned from January |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 July 2009 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/full-body-swimsuit-now-banned-professional-swimmers/story?id=9437780 |title=Full Body Swimsuit Now Banned for Professional Swimmers |publisher=ABC News |date=4 January 2010 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increase in technology has also allowed many decisions in sports matches to be taken, or reviewed, off-field, with another official using instant replays to make decisions.

===Politics===
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2010}}
{{Main article|Politics and sports}}
Sports and politics can influence each other greatly.

[[Benito Mussolini]] used the [[1934 FIFA World Cup]], which was held in [[Italy]], to showcase [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HWj7BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28 |title=Soccer Vs. the State: Tackling Football and Radical Politics |last1=Kuhn |first1=Gabriel |date=2011 |page=28 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="World Fascism"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nvD2rZSVau4C&amp;pg=PA630 |title=World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1 |last1=Blamires |first1=Cyprian |date=2006 |pages=630–632 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adolf Hitler]] also used the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] held in [[Berlin]], and the [[1936 Winter Olympics]] held in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], to promote the [[Nazi ideology]] of the superiority of the [[Aryan race]], and inferiority of the Jews and other "[[Untermensch|undesirables]]".&lt;ref name="World Fascism"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sociology Sport"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uKarC6oX3P8C&amp;pg=PT32&amp;dq=hitler+used+1936+olympics+to+promote+ideology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=x6N1Va3pJ-Sa7gaVoICoBA&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=hitler%20used%201936%20olympics%20to%20promote%20ideology&amp;f=false |title=The Sociology of Sport and Physical Education |last1=Saxena |first1=Anurag |year=2001 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany used the Olympics to give of itself a peaceful image while it was very actively preparing the war.&lt;ref&gt;Kulttuurivihkot 1 2009 Berliinin olympialaiset 1936 Poliittisen viattomuuden menetys Jouko Jokisalo 28-29{{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[apartheid]] was the official policy in [[South Africa]], many sports people, particularly in [[rugby union]], adopted the conscientious approach that they should not appear in competitive sports there. Some feel this was an effective contribution to the eventual demolition of the policy of apartheid, others feel that it may have prolonged and reinforced its worst effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1478-0542.2005.00165.x |title=Sport and apartheid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the history of [[Ireland]], Gaelic sports were connected with [[cultural nationalism]]. Until the mid-20th&amp;nbsp;century a person could have been banned from playing [[Gaelic football]], [[hurling]], or other sports administered by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) if she/he played or supported [[Association football]], or other games seen to be of [[Great Britain|British]] origin. Until recently the GAA continued to ban the playing of football and [[rugby union]] at Gaelic venues. This ban, also known as Rule 42,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fulton |first=Gareth |last2=Bairner |first2=Alan |year=2007 |title=Sport, Space and National Identity in Ireland: The GAA, Croke Park and Rule&amp;nbsp;42. |url= |journal=Space &amp; policy |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=55–74 |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is still enforced, but was modified to allow football and rugby to be played in [[Croke Park]] while [[Lansdowne Road]] was redeveloped into [[Aviva Stadium]]. Until recently, under Rule&amp;nbsp;21, the GAA also banned members of the British security forces and members of the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] from playing Gaelic games, but the advent of the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in 1998 led to the eventual removal of the ban.

[[Nationalism]] is often evident in the pursuit of sport, or in its reporting: people compete in national teams, or commentators and audiences can adopt a partisan view. On occasion, such tensions can lead to violent confrontation among players or spectators within and beyond the sporting venue, as in the [[Football War]]. These trends are seen by many as contrary to the fundamental ethos of sport being carried on for its own sake and for the enjoyment of its participants.

A very famous case when sport and politics collided was the 1972 Olympics in Munich. Masked men entered the hotel of the Israeli olympic team and killed many of their men. This was known as the [[Munich massacre]].

A study of US elections has shown that the result of sports events can affect the results. A study published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] showed that when the home team wins the game before the election, the incumbent candidates can increase their share of the vote by 1.5&amp;nbsp;percent. A loss had the opposite effect, and the effect is greater for higher-profile teams or unexpected wins and losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Will Ohio State's Football Team Decide Who Wins the White House? |author1=Tyler Cowen |author2=Kevin Grier |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=24 October 2012 |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/how_the_presidential_race_between_barack_obama_and_mitt_romney_could_be.html |accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, when [[Washington Redskins]] win their final game before an election, then the incumbent President is more likely to win, and if the Redskins lose, then the opposition candidate is more likely to win; this has become known as the [[Redskins Rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/football-insider/wp/2012/11/03/will-redskins-rule-again-determine-outcome-of-presidential-election/ |title=Will Redskins Rule again determine outcome of presidential election? |author=Mike Jones |date=3 November 2012 |work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfrontrow.com/2012/10/redskins-rule-mnfs-hirdt-on-intersection-of-football-politics/ |title='Redskins Rule': MNF's Hirdt on intersection of football &amp; politics |work=ESPN Front Row}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sports as a means of controlling and subduing populations====
[[Étienne de La Boétie]], in his essay ''[[Discourse on Voluntary Servitude]]'' describes athletic spectacles as means for tyrants to control their subjects by distracting them.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Do not imagine that there is any bird more easily caught by decoy, nor any fish sooner fixed on the hook by wormy bait, than are all these poor fools neatly tricked into servitude by the slightest feather passed, so to speak, before their mouths. Truly it is a marvelous thing that they let themselves be caught so quickly at the slightest tickling of their fancy. Plays, farces, spectacles, gladiators, strange beasts, medals, pictures, and other such opiates, these were for ancient peoples the bait toward slavery, the price of their liberty, the instruments of tyranny. By these practices and enticements the ancient dictators so successfully lulled their subjects under the yoke, that the stupefied peoples, fascinated by the pastimes and vain pleasures flashed before their eyes, learned subservience as naïvely, but not so creditably, as little children learn to read by looking at bright picture books.&lt;ref&gt;[[Étienne de La Boétie]], ''[[Discourse on Voluntary Servitude]]'' (1549), Part 2&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Religious views on sports===
The practice of athletic competitions has been criticised by some Christian thinkers as a form of [[idolatry]], in which "human beings extol themselves, adore themselves, sacrifice themselves and reward themselves."&lt;ref name=Watson1&gt;''Sports and Christianity: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives'', Nick J. Watson, ed. (Routledge: 2013), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Sports are seen by these critics as a manifestation of "collective pride" and "national self-deification" in which feats of human power are idolized at the expense of divine worship.&lt;ref name=Watson1/&gt;

[[Tertullian]] condemns the athletic performances of his day, insisting "the entire apparatus of the shows is based upon idolatry."&lt;ref&gt;[[Tertullian]], ''[[De spectaculis]]'', Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The shows, says Tertullian, excite passions foreign to the calm temperament cultivated by the Christian:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
God has enjoined us to deal calmly, gently, quietly, and peacefully with the Holy Spirit, because these things are alone in keeping with the goodness of His nature, with His tenderness and sensitiveness. ... Well, how shall this be made to accord with the shows? For the show always leads to spiritual agitation, since where there is pleasure, there is keenness of feeling giving pleasure its zest; and where there is keenness of feeling, there is rivalry giving in turn its zest to that. Then, too, where you have rivalry, you have rage, bitterness, wrath and grief, with all bad things which flow from them&amp;nbsp;– the whole entirely out of keeping with the religion of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;''[[De spectaculis]]'' Chapter 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''sports rating system''' is a system that analyzes the results of sports competitions to provide [[Evaluation|rating]]s for each team or player. Common systems include polls of expert voters, [[crowdsourcing]] non-expert voters, betting markets, and computer systems. Ratings, or '''power ratings''', are numerical representations of competitive strength, often directly comparable so that the game outcome between any two teams can be predicted. [[Ranking]]s, or '''power rankings''', can be directly provided (e.g., by asking people to rank teams), or can be derived by sorting each team's ratings and assigning an [[Ordinal scale|ordinal]] rank to each team, so that the highest rated team earns the #1 rank. Rating systems provide an alternative to traditional sports [[standings]] which are based on win-loss-tie ratios.

[[File:UCF at the Texas goal line.jpg|thumb|right|College football players in the United States]]
In the United States, the biggest use of sports ratings systems is to rate [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] college football teams in [[NCAA Division I|Division I FBS]], choosing teams to play in the [[College Football Playoff]]. Sports ratings systems are also used to help determine the field for the NCAA [[College basketball|men's and women's basketball]] tournaments, men's professional [[golf]] tournaments, professional [[tennis]] tournaments, and [[NASCAR]]. They are often mentioned in discussions about the teams that could or should receive invitations to participate in certain contests, despite not earning the most direct entrance path (such as a league championship).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://aol.sportingnews.com/ncaa-basketball/story/2011-03-09/sorting-through-teams-on-one-big-bubble |website=[[Sporting News]] |accessdate=2011-03-24 |date=2011-03-09 |last=Fagan |first=Ryan |title=Sorting through teams on one big bubble |quote=This is a look at 20 of the teams (in alphabetical order) residing on this year’s big ol’ bubble. We’ve included three statistical rankings. The RPI (ratings percentage index, taken from collegeRPI.com) is considered the standard and is provided to committee members during the selection process. The two other ranking indexes include margin of victory in their formulas—the Pomeroy ratings (at kenpom.com) and Sagarin ratings (via USA Today)—aren’t new but have played an increased role in discussions about potential seeds during this college basketball season.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer rating systems can tend toward [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]], without specific player, team, regional, or style bias. [[Ken Massey]] writes that an advantage of computer rating systems is that they can "objectively track all" 351 college basketball teams, while human polls "have limited value".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |author= [[Ken Massey]] |user= masseyratings|number= 529238966965661696 |date= 3 Nov 2014 |title= @kenpomeroy human polls have limited value.  Computer systems can objectively track all the teams.  http://www.masseyratings.com/cb/compare.htm #all351 |access-date= 9 Nov 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer ratings are verifiable and repeatable, and are comprehensive, requiring assessment of all selected criteria. By comparison, rating systems relying on human polls include inherent human subjectivity; this may or may not be an attractive property depending on system needs.

== History ==

Sports ratings systems have been around for almost 80 years, when ratings were calculated on paper rather than by computer, as most are today.  Some older computer systems still in use today include: [[Jeff Sagarin|Jeff Sagarin's]] systems, the ''[[New York Times]]'' system, and the [[Dunkel Index]], which dates back to 1929. Before the advent of the college football playoff, the [[Bowl Championship Series]] championship game participants were determined by a combination of expert polls and computer systems.

== Theory ==

Sports ratings systems use a variety of methods for rating teams, but the most prevalent method is called a power rating.  The power rating of a team is a calculation of the team's strength relative to other teams in the same league or division.  The basic idea is to maximize the amount of [[transitive relation]]s in a given data set due to game outcomes.  For example, if A defeats B and B defeats C, then one can safely say that A&gt;B&gt;C.

There are obvious problems with basing a system solely on wins and losses.  For example, if C defeats A, then an [[Intransitivity|intransitive]] relation is established (A&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;B&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;C&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;A) and a ranking violation will occur if this is the only data available.  Scenarios such as this happen fairly regularly in sports—for example, in the [[2005 NCAA Division I-A football season]], [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State]] beat [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]], Ohio State beat [[University of Michigan|Michigan]], and Michigan beat Penn State.  To address these logical breakdowns, rating systems usually consider other criteria such as the game's score and where the match was held (for example, to assess a [[home field advantage]]).  In most cases though, each team plays a sufficient amount of other games during a given season, which lessens the overall effect of such violations.

From an [[academic]] perspective, the use of [[linear algebra]] and [[statistics]] are popular among many of the systems' authors to determine their ratings. Some academic work is published in forums like the [[MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference]], others in traditional statistics, mathematics, psychology, and computer science journals.

If sufficient "inter-divisional" league play is not accomplished, teams in an isolated division may be artificially propped up or down in the overall ratings due to a lack of correlation to other teams in the overall league.  This phenomenon is evident in systems that analyze historical college football seasons, such as when the top [[Ivy League]] teams of the 1970s, like [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]], were calculated by some rating systems to be comparable with accomplished powerhouse teams of that era such as [[University of Nebraska|Nebraska]], [[University of Southern California|USC]], and [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]].  This conflicts with the subjective opinion that claims that while good in their own right, they were not nearly as good as those top programs.  However, this may be considered a "pro" by non-[[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]] teams in Division I-A college football who point out that ratings systems have proven that their top teams belong in the same strata as the BCS teams.  This is evidenced by the 2004 [[University of Utah|Utah]] team that went undefeated in the regular season and earned a BCS bowl bid due to the bump in their overall BCS ratings via the computer ratings component.  They went on to play and defeat the [[Big East Conference (1979–2013)|Big East Conference]] champion [[University of Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh]] in the 2005 [[Fiesta Bowl]] by a score of 35-7.  A related example occurred during the 2006 [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament]] where [[George Mason University|George Mason]] were awarded an at-large tournament bid due to their regular season record and their [[Ratings Percentage Index|RPI rating]] and rode that opportunity all the way to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Final Four]].

Goals of some rating systems differ from one another. For example, systems may be crafted to provide a perfect retrodictive analysis of the games played to-date, while others are predictive and give more weight to future trends rather than past results.  This results in the potential for misinterpretation of rating system results by people unfamiliar with these goals; for example, a rating system designed to give accurate [[point spread]] predictions for gamblers might be ill-suited for use in selecting teams most deserving to play in a championship game or tournament.

==Rating considerations==

===Home advantage===
[[File:France national team fans.jpg|thumb|right|France national basketball team fans]]
{{main article|Home advantage}}
When two teams of equal quality play, the team at home tends to win more often. The size of the effect changes based on the era of play, game type, season length, sport, even [[Circadian advantage|number of time zones crossed]]. But across all conditions, "simply playing at home increases the chances of winning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://wjh.harvard.edu/~jamieson/JJ_JASP.pdf|title=The Home Field Advantage in Athletics: A Meta-Analysis|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|last=Jamieson|first=Jeremy P.|accessdate=11 November 2014|date=2010|volume=40|issue=7|pages=1819–1848|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2010.00641.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; A win away from home is therefore seen more favorably than a win at home, because it was more challenging. Home advantage (which, for sports played on a pitch, is almost always called "home field advantage") is also based on the qualities of the individual stadium and crowd; the advantage in the NFL can be more than a 4-point difference from the stadium with the least advantage to the stadium with the most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/features/bill-barnwell-best-home-field-advantages/|website=[[Grantland]]|last=Barnwell|first=Bill|date=December 20, 2013|accessdate=November 11, 2014|title=Safe at Home}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strength of schedule===
{{main article|Strength of schedule}}
Strength of schedule refers to the quality of a team's opponents. A win against an inferior opponent is usually seen less favorably than a win against a superior opponent. Often teams in the same league, who are compared against each other for championship or playoff consideration, have not played the same opponents. Therefore, judging their relative win-loss records is complicated.
{{quote|text=We looked beyond the record. The committee placed significant value on Oregon's quality of wins.|sign=[[College football playoff]] committee chairman [[Jeff Long (athletic director)|Jeff Long]]|source=press conference, week 12 of the 2014 season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Russo |first=Ralph D. |title=Oregon up to 2 in playoff rankings; TCU to 4th |url=http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/347875155d53465d95cec892aeb06419/Article_2014-11-11-FBC-Playoff-Rankings/id-c0570dfb5a0044a798224fbef5da73b8 |agency=Associated Press |date=11 November 2014 |accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; after ranking 9–1 Oregon above 9–0 Florida State}}
The college football playoff committee uses a limited strength-of-schedule algorithm that only considers opponents' records and opponents' opponents' records&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |author= [[Stewart Mandel]] |user= slmandel|number= 532624545300369408 |date= 12 Nov 2014 |title= Committee doesn't use an SOS ranking. It looks at opponents' record and opponents' opponents record. |access-date= 12 Nov 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (much like [[Ratings Percentage Index|RPI]]).

===Points versus wins===
A key dichotomy among sports rating systems lies in the representation of game outcomes. Some systems store final scores as [[Three-valued logic|ternary]] discrete events: wins, draws, and losses. Other systems record the exact final game score, then judge teams based on [[margin of victory]]. Rating teams based on margin of victory is often criticized as creating an incentive for coaches to run up the score, an "unsportsmanlike" outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxsports.com/collegefootball/story/RICHARDS%253A-BCS-removes-margin-of-victory-element |newspaper=[[Fox Sports]] |date=2001 |accessdate=12 November 2014|last=Richards|first=Darryl|title=BCS removes margin-of-victory element}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still other systems choose a middle ground, reducing the [[marginal value]] of additional points as the margin of victory increases. Sagarin chose to clamp the margin of victory to a predetermined amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/ncaaf/sagarin/|title=NCAAF Jeff Sagarin Ratings|last=Sagarin|first=Jeff|authorlink=Jeff Sagarin|date=Fall 2014|accessdate=12 November 2014|website=[[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other approaches include the use of a decay function, such as a [[logarithm]] or placement on a [[cumulative distribution function]].

===In-game information===
Beyond points or wins, some system designers choose to include more granular information about the game. Examples include time of possession of the ball, individual statistics, and lead changes. Data about weather, injuries, or "throw-away" games near season's end may affect game outcomes but are difficult to model. "Throw-away games" are games where teams have already earned playoff slots and have secured their playoff seeding before the end of the regular season, and want to rest/protect their starting players by benching them for remaining regular season games. This usually results in unpredictable outcomes and may skew the outcome of rating systems.

===Team composition===
Teams often shift their composition between and within games, and players routinely get injured. Rating a team is often about rating a specific collection of players. Some systems assume [[parity (sports)|parity]] among all members of the league, such as each team being built from an equitable pool of players via a [[Draft (sports)|draft]] or [[free agent|free agency]] system as is done in many major league sports such as the [[National Football League|NFL]], [[Major League Baseball|MLB]], [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], and [[National Hockey League|NHL]]. This is certainly not the case in collegiate leagues such as Division I-A football or men's and women's basketball.

===Cold start===
At the beginning of a season, there have been no games from which to judge teams' relative quality. Solutions to the cold start problem often include some measure of the previous season, perhaps weighted by what percent of the team is returning for the new season. [[ARGH Power Ratings]] is an example of a system that uses multiple previous years plus a percentage weight of returning players.

==Rating methods==
{{inc-sport}}

===Permutation of standings===
Several methods offer some permutation of traditional standings. This search for the "real" win-loss record often involves using other data, such as point differential or identity of opponents, to alter a team's record in a way that is easily understandable. Sportswriter [[Gregg Easterbrook]] created a measure of Authentic Games, which only considers games played against opponents deemed to be of sufficiently high quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/page/TMQWeekEleven141118/more-defensive-penalties-causes-change-nfl-tuesday-morning-quarterback|title=More flags on D spins scoreboards|last=Easterbrook|first=Gregg|authorlink=Gregg Easterbrook|date=18 November 2014 |accessdate=19 November 2014|website=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consensus is that all wins are not created equal.
{{quote|text=I went through the first few weeks of games and redid everyone’s records, tagging each game as either a legitimate win or loss, an ass-kicking win or loss, or an either/or game. And if anything else happened in that game with gambling repercussions – a comeback win, a blown lead, major dysfunction, whatever — I tagged that, too.|sign=[[Bill Simmons]], sportswriter|source=[[Grantland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/the-triangle/week-8-picks-a-gambling-epiphany/|title=Week 8 Picks: A Gambling Epiphany|last=Simmons|first=Bill|authorlink=Bill Simmons|date=24 October 2014 |accessdate=19 November 2014|website=[[Grantland]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Pythagorean====
{{main article|Pythagorean expectation}}
Pythagorean expectation, or Pythagorean projection, calculates a percentage based on the number of points a team has scored and allowed. Typically the formula involves the number of points scored, raised to some exponent, placed in the numerator. Then the number of points the team allowed, raised to the same exponent, is placed in the denominator and added to the value in the numerator. [[Football Outsiders]] has used&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schatz|first1=Aaron|last2=Alamar|first2=Ben|last3=Barnwell|first3=Bill |author4=Bill Connelly |author5=Doug Farrar|title=Football Outsiders Almanac 2011: The Essential Guide to the 2011 NFL and College Football Seasons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E84YYAAACAAJ|year=2011|publisher=CreateSpace|isbn=978-1-4662-4613-3|page=xviii}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Pythagorean wins} = \frac{\text{Points For}^{2.37}}{\text{Points For}^{2.37} + \text{Points Against}^{2.37}}\times \text{Games Played}.&lt;/math&gt;
The resulting percentage is often compared to a team's true winning percentage, and a team is said to have "overachieved" or "underachieved" compared to the Pythagorean expectation. For example, [[Bill Barnwell]] calculated that before week 9 of the 2014 NFL season, the [[Arizona Cardinals]] had a Pythagorean record two wins lower than their real record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/the-triangle/nfl-at-the-half-breaking-down-the-numbers/|title=NFL at the Half: Breaking Down the Numbers|last=Barnwell|first=Bill|authorlink=Bill Barnwell|date=November 5, 2014|accessdate=January 7, 2015|website=[[Grantland]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Simmons]] cites Barnwell's work before week 10 of that season and adds that "any numbers nerd is waving a “REGRESSION!!!!!” flag right now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/the-triangle/revisiting-the-y2k-compliant-quarterbacks/|last=Simmons|first=Bill|authorlink=Bill Simmons|date=7 November 2014|accessdate=10 November 2014|title=Revisiting the Y2K-Compliant Quarterbacks}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this example, the Arizona Cardinals' regular season record was 8-1 going into the 10th week of the 2014 season. The Pythagorean win formula implied a winning percentage of 57.5%, based on 208 points scored and 183 points allowed. Multiplied by 9 games played, the Cardinals' Pythagorean expectation was 5.2 wins and 3.8 losses. The team had "overachieved" at that time by 2.8 wins, derived from their actual 8 wins less the expected 5.2 wins, an increase of 0.8 overachieved wins from just a week prior.

===Trading "skill points"===
{{main article|Elo rating system}}
Originally designed by [[Arpad Elo]] as a method for ranking chess players, several people have adapted the Elo rating system for team sports such as basketball, soccer and American football. For instance, [[Jeff Sagarin]] and [[FiveThirtyEight]] publish NFL football rankings using Elo methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/introducing-nfl-elo-ratings/|title=Introducing NFL Elo Ratings|last=Silver|first=Nate|authorlink=Nate Silver|date=4 September 2014|accessdate=10 November 2014|website=[[FiveThirtyEight]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elo ratings initially assign strength values to each team, and teams trade points based on the outcome of each game.

===Solving equations===

Researchers like Matt Mills use [[Markov chains]] to model college football games, with team strength scores as outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thespread.us/continuous-markov-ratings.html|last=Mills|first=Matt|website=The Spread|date=21 December 2014|accessdate=21 December 2014|title=Using Continuous-Time Markov Chains to Rank College Football Teams}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algorithms like Google's [[PageRank]] have also been adapted to rank football teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ranking-nfl-teams-using-network-science-konstantinos-pelechrinis?trk=prof-post/|website=[[LinkedIN]]|date=17 March 2016|accessdate=17 March 2016|title=Ranking NFL teams using Network Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/CFBAnalysis/comments/2ppfg3/modifying_googles_page_ranking_algorithm_to_rank/|website=[[Reddit]]|date=21 December 2014|accessdate=22 December 2014|title=Modifying Google's Page Ranking Algorithm to rank teams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26199">A '''stadium subsidy''' is a type of government [[subsidy]] given to [[professional sports]] franchises to help finance the construction or renovation of a [[sports venue]].  Stadium subsidies can come in the form of tax-free [[municipal bonds]], cash payments, long-term tax exemptions, infrastructure improvements, and operating cost subsidies.  Funding for stadium subsidies can come from all levels of government and remains controversial among legislators and citizens.  There is an ongoing debate among economists and municipalities about the aggregate effects of hosting a professional athletic team. &lt;ref name="kianka2013a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawweb2009.law.villanova.edu/sportslaw/?p=1853|title=Subsidizing Billionaires: How Your Money is Being Used to Construct Professional Sports Stadiums|author=Kianka, Tim|date=6 March 2013|publisher=Jeffrey S.

==Background==

===In the United States===
Eighty years ago, stadium subsidies were essentially unheard of, with funding for professional sports stadiums coming from private sources. In 1951, [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] commissioner [[Ford Frick]] decided that league teams were bringing large amounts of revenue to their host cities from which owners weren't able to profit. He announced that cities would need to start supporting their teams by building and maintaining venues through public subsidy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sports Economics|last=Fort|first=Rodney D.|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2011|isbn=9780136066026|location=Boston|pages=408, 409}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, most new or renovated professional sports stadiums are financed at least partly through stadium subsidies. While Frick may have been a catalyst, this change has been primarily caused by the increase in bargaining power of professional sports teams at the expense of their host cities.  As the years have passed, [[municipalities]] have come to love their local professional sports teams.  

Recently there have been many studies that have suggested that there are a number of direct and indirect economic benefits associated with hosting a professional sports team, although each city experiences this to a different degree.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baade|first=Robert A.|last2=Dye|first2=Richard F.|date=1990-04-01|title=The Impact of Stadium and Professional Sports on Metropolitan Area Development|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2257.1990.tb00513.x/abstract|journal=Growth and Change|language=en|volume=21|issue=2|pages=1–14|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2257.1990.tb00513.x|issn=1468-2257}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coates|first=Dennis|date=2007-10-01|title=Stadiums and Arenas: Economic Development or Economic Redistribution?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1465-7287.2007.00073.x/abstract|journal=Contemporary Economic Policy|language=en|volume=25|issue=4|pages=565–577|doi=10.1111/j.1465-7287.2007.00073.x|issn=1465-7287}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even still, a survey conducted in 2017 found that "83% of economists polled believed that a subsidy's cost to the public outweighed the economic benefits".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wolla|first=Scott|date=May 2017|title=The Economics of Subsidizing Sports Stadiums|url=https://www.brookings.edu/articles/sports-jobs-taxes-are-new-stadiums-worth-the-cost/|journal=Page One Economics|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/sports-stadiums|title=Sports Stadiums|last=|first=|date=January 31, 2017|website=IMG Forum|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economics behind issuing billions of dollars to professional athletic organizations are still unclear, but cities have clearly showed that they are willing to assume the best, as recent years have seen an increase in the number of subsidies issues and the amount of money issued per subsidy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://deadspin.com/the-raiders-robbed-las-vegas-in-americas-worst-stadium-1795475973|title=The Raiders Robbed Las Vegas In America's Worst Stadium Deal|last=Brown|first=T.M.|work=Deadspin|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/falcons-new-home-is-just-the-latest-of-handouts-to-the-nfl/article/2633548|title=Falcons' new home is just the latest of handouts to the NFL|last=Kampis|first=Johnny|work=Washington Examiner|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Long|first=Judith Grant|date=May 1, 2005|title=The Real Cost of Funding for Major League Sports Facilities|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1527002504264614#articleCitationDownloadContainer|journal=Journal of Sports Economics|volume=6|pages=|via=SAGE Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty-seven of the 30 stadiums built between 1953 and 1970 received more than $450 million in total public funding for construction.&lt;ref&gt;Okner, B. “Subsidies of Stadiums and Arenas,” in ''Government and the Sports Business'', edited by R. G.Noll. Washington, DC: The Brookings Institution, 1974, 325–48.&lt;/ref&gt;  During this period, publicly funding a stadium grew in popularity as an effective incentive to attract professional sports teams to up and coming cities.  Famous examples include the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] leaving New York in exchange for [[Dodger Stadium|300 acres in Chavez Ravine]] and the [[History of the New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] moving to San Francisco for what would eventually become [[Candlestick Park]].&lt;ref name="phelps"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://scholarship.law.stjohns.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1178&amp;context=jcred | title=Stadium Construction for Professional Sports: Reversing the Inequities Through Tax Incentives | author=Phelps, Zachary A. | journal=Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development | year=2004 | volume=18 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Los Angeles Coliseum became the first fully publicly funded stadium in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.usc.edu/135433/usc-kicks-off-270-million-renovation-of-coliseum/|title=USC kicks off $270 million renovation of Coliseum - USC News|website=news.usc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, a market for subsidies has come into existence.  Sports teams have realized their ability to relocate at lower and lower costs to their private contributors.  Because local governments feel that keeping their sports teams around is critical to the success of their cities, they comply and grant teams subsidies. This creates a market for subsidies, where professional athletic organizations can shop between cities to see which municipality will provide them with the most resources.  Teams in the NFL have a major incentive to keep their stadium up to date, as the NFL allows teams to bid to host the Super Bowl and takes recent and planned renovations into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TjDiwwaN5VsC&amp;pg=PA1509#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Sports Management and Marketing|last=Swayne|first=Linda E.|date=2011|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9781412973823|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2003-09-22-ny-nj-superbowl_x.htm|title=USATODAY.com - N.Y./N.J.

=== In Europe ===
Public subsidies for major league sports stadiums and arenas are far less common in Europe than in the United States. The relationship between the local clubs and the cities that host them is typically much stronger than in the United States, with the team being more intrinsic to the cities' identity. Cities would be significantly more upset at the departure of their beloved local teams, and viable alternative cities already have their own clubs to whom their residents are loyal. As a result, the leagues in Europe have significantly less bargaining power. They will not threaten to relocate to another city if not provided with a subsidy, or at the very least the threat would not be credible&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/26160156|title=Sport, space, and the city|last=John.|first=Bale,|date=1993|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415080983|location=London|oclc=26160156}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is also worth noting that the NFL, the league in the United States whose stadiums have the highest percentage of public financing of the four major leagues, does not have an equivalent in Europe; American football is relatively unpopular.

==Types of Subsidies==
There are two primary ways that a city facilitates the construction of a stadium.  The first, and most commonly used method, is a direct subsidy.  This involves a city promising a certain amount of revenue to go towards the construction, maintenance, and renovation of a stadium.  Other times, the city will give tax breaks to teams or stadium owners in lieu of a direct cash transfer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Over a period of time, a reduction in the taxes paid against the stadium generally saves the organization building the stadium around the same amount as a subsidy would be worth.  

In the USA, the annual subsidies provided by the state for the construction of stadiums are in the range of billions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/30/news/companies/nfl-taxpayers/|title=NFL gets billions in subsidies from U.S. taxpayers|author=Isidore, Chris|date=2015-01-30|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ideas.time.com/2013/12/06/football-a-waste-of-taxpayers-money/|title=Football: A Waste of Taxpayers’ Money|author=Gillespie, Nick|date=2013-12-06|publisher=Time, Inc.|accessdate=2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2005 study of all sports stadiums and facilities in use by the four major leagues from 1990 to 2001 calculated a total public subsidy of approximately $17 billion, or approx. $24 billion in 2018 dollars. The average annual subsidy during that period was $1.6 billion ($2.2 billion in 2018) for all 99 facilities included in the study, with an average of $16.2 million ($22.8 million in 2018) per facility annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Long|first=Judith Grant|date=May 1, 2005|title=Full Count: The Real Cost of Public Funding For Major League Sports Facilities|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1527002504264614|journal=Journal Of Sports Economics|volume=6|pages=119-143|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 Bloomberg analysis estimates that tax exemptions annually cost the [[U.S. Treasury]] $146 million.&lt;ref name="bloomberg" /&gt;

==Benefits==
In granting stadium subsidies, governments claim that the new or improved stadiums will have positive [[Externality|enternalities]] for the city.  Proponents tout improvements to the local economy as the primary benefits.  Economists who debate the issue have separated the effects on a local economy into direct and indirect effects.  Direct benefits are those that exist as a result of the "rent, concessions, parking, advertising, suite rental, and other preferred seating rental", and direct expenses come from "wages and related expenses, utilities, repairs and maintenance, insurance," and the costs of building the facilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   Generally, these benefits vary widely.  The [[Baltimore Orioles|Balitmore Orioles]], for example, estimate that each game they host brings $3 million in economic benefits to the city.  Over the course of an entire baseball season, the [[Baltimore Orioles|Orioles]] will have 81 home games, which means that benefit gets multiplied to be around $243 million a season.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/articles/sports-jobs-taxes-are-new-stadiums-worth-the-cost/|title=Sports, Jobs, &amp; Taxes: Are New Stadiums Worth the Cost?|last=Noll|first=Andrew Zimbalist and Roger G.|date=|work=Brookings|access-date=2018-03-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For [[NFL]] teams the case is much different, as there are only 8 home games a season.  Over the lifetime of a stadium, which is often between 20-30 years, this benefit accumulates even more.  Essentially, this is the basis on which municipalities evaluate the benefit of a team.  [[File:Stadium economics public economics.png|thumb|395x395px|Visual Representation of the Social Marginal Benefit Calculation]]Supporters further argue that the stadiums attract tourism and businesses that lead to further spending and job creation, representing indirect benefits.  All of the increased spending causes a [[Local multiplier effect|multiplier effect]] that leads to more spending and job creation and eventually finances the subsidy through increased tax revenues from ticket and concessions sales, improved property values and more spending nearby the stadium.&lt;ref name="brookings1997"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zimbalist|first1=Andrew|last2=Noll|first2=Roger G|title=Sports, Jobs, &amp; Taxes: Are New Stadiums Worth the Cost?|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/1997/06/summer-taxes-noll|website=Brookings Institution|publisher=The Brookings Institution|accessdate=17 February 2016|date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases, there has even been an observed reduction in crime during a game, although the aggregate effect of professional sports on crime is disputable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laqueur|first=Hannah|last2=Copus|first2=Ryan|date=2014-04-25|title=Entertainment as Crime Prevention: Evidence from Chicago Sports Games|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2429551|language=en|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White, G. F., Katz, J., &amp; Scarborough, K. E. (1992). The impact of professional football games upon violent assaults on women. ''Violence and Victims, 7''(2), 157-71.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, there has recently been research that suggests that home games generate what is called a "sunny day benefit".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Rappaport, J., &amp; Wilkerson, C. (2001). What are the benefits of hosting a major league sports franchise? ''Economic Review - Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, 86''(1), 55-86. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://ccl.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/218422373?accountid=10141&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a measurable drop in local spending that occurs within a city on a rainy day, but with a professional sports team playing a game, spending increases significantly.  Jordan Rappaport, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas, estimates that this benefit is between $14 to $24 million dollars a year, which can be compounded over the life of a stadium.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan Rappaport &amp; Chad R. Wilkerson, 2001. "[https://ideas.repec.org/a/fip/fedker/y2001iqip55-86nv.86no.1.html What are the benefits of hosting a major league sports franchise?,]" Economic Review, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, issue Q I, pages 55-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates for stadium subsidies also claim less quantifiable [[positive externalities]], such as civic pride and [[Fan (person)|fan identification]], so that hosting a major sports team becomes something of a [[public good]].  Local sports fans enjoy the benefit even if they do not pay for it.&lt;ref name="brookings1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="owen"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.cas.unt.edu/~jhauge/teaching/sports/owen.pdf | title=The Intangible Benefits of Sports Teams | author=Owen, Jeffrey G. | journal=Public Finance and Management | year=2006 | volume=6 | issue=3 | pages=321–345}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When a city conducts a calculation to assess what they are willing to pay for a [[subsidy]], they use an economic model that attempts to quantify the various social benefits for each dollar invested.  This is done through a social [[marginal benefit]] evaluation, which takes the sums of all of the private benefits that result from investing, intended or not.   Economists consider all the economic effects of having a professional athletic team in a city, like the "sunny day" benefit, job creation, civic pride, increased tourism, decreases/increases in crime rates, etc.  The social [[marginal cost]] is equal to the sum of the private [[Marginal benefit|marginal benefits]].  The [[marginal cost]] is known only by the government, who deliberates with franchises to decide how much bringing a team to their city will cost.  The image to the right is a good visual representation of this analysis.  In this diagram, the city would like to acquire four teams, since at that point the social [[marginal benefit]] of recruiting a team still exceeds the [[marginal cost]].

==Criticisms==
[[File:Social marginal cost graph1.png|thumb|396x396px|Visual Representation of the Social Marginal Cost]]
Many criticisms exist regarding the use of stadium subsidies.  First, critics argue that new stadiums generate little to no new spending ([[consumption (economics)|consumption]]).  Instead, what fans spend in and around the stadium are substitutes for what they would otherwise spend on different entertainment options.  Thus, this argument contends, new stadiums do not cause economic growth or lead to increased aggregate income.  In fact, this suggests that money being substituted towards concessions, tickets, and merchandise actively harms the economy surrounding a stadium.&lt;ref name="fed2001"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.stlouisfed.org/Publications/Regional-Economist/April-2001/Should-Cities-Pay-for-Sports-Facilities | title=Should Cities Pay for Sports Facilities? | publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis | work=The Regional Economist | date=2001-04-01 | accessdate=2016-02-02 | author=Zaretsky, Adam M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Another criticism of stadium subsidies is that much of the money the new stadiums bring in does not stay in the local economy.  Instead of going to stadium employees and other sources that would benefit the local community, a lot of the money goes toward paying the organizations.&lt;ref name="fed2001" /&gt;  Those payments come from either the state or city government, where spending normally goes towards social welfare programs or salaries for government employees.  It has been argued that the [[opportunity cost]] of a subsidy for a sports team is far greater than the benefit, since the billions of dollars that are spent on a stadium could be better spent on schools, firehouses, public transportation, or police departments.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kianka2013a" /&gt;  

Critics also argue that the construction of new stadiums could cause citizens and businesses to leave a city because of [[eminent domain]] issues.  If a city is forced to take land from its citizens to build a new stadium, those who have lost land could become angry enough to leave the city.  If they are business owners, then they will likely take their businesses with them.  These trade-offs are a part of the [[marginal cost]] calculation the city does.  Much like the social [[marginal benefit]] calculation the city performed to find what benefits teams brought to the city, the social [[marginal cost]] calculation sums up all of the unintended negative effects from a particular spending plan.

A review of the empirical literature assessing the effects of subsidies for professional sports franchises and facilities reveals that most evidence goes against sports subsidies.  Specifically, subsidies cannot be  justified on the grounds of local economic development, income growth or job creation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="owen" /&gt;

A basic '''table tennis racqet''' (also known as a "[[bat-and-ball games|paddle]]" or "bat") is used by [[table tennis]] players. The table tennis racket is usually made from laminated wood covered with rubber on one or two sides depending on the player's grip.  Unlike a conventional "[[Racqet_(sports_equipment)|racqet]]", it does not include strings strung across an open frame. The USA generally uses the term "paddle" while Europeans and Asians use the term "bat" and the official ITTF term is "racket".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=ITTF |date=August 2018 |accessdate=16 November 2018 |title=The International Table Tennis Federation Handbook 2018 |url=https://d3mjm6zw6cr45s.cloudfront.net/2018/02/2018ITTFHandbook_v2.pdf_0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Table tennis regulations approved by the [[International Table Tennis Federation]] (ITTF) allow different surfaces on each side of the paddle for various amounts of spin (including nullifying it) or speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Varenberg|first1=M.|last2=Varenberg|first2=A.|date=2012|title=Table tennis rubber: Tribological characterization|journal=Tribology Letters|volume=47|issue=1|pages=51–56|doi=10.1007/s11249-012-9961-4|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11249-012-9961-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a player may have a spin-heavy rubber on one side of his paddle, and no spin on the other side. The player can flip the racket in play for different types of returns. To help a player distinguish between different types of rubber used by his opponent, regulations specify that one side of a paddle must be red while the other must be black, allowing a player to see what side of a paddle hits the ball mid-play. The player has the right to inspect his opponent's racquet before a match to see the type and color. Current rules state that, unless damaged in play, the paddle cannot be exchanged for another at any time during a match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ping Pong Paddle|url=https://bestreviewshunt.com/best-ping-pong-paddle/|publisher=Bestreviewshunt.com|accessdate=17 November 2016|date=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rubber coating may be of pimpled rubber, with the pimples outward, or it may be composed of a sponge layer, covered by rubber that may have the pimples pointed inwards or outwards.  Some paddles are not covered with rubber ("naked") to make it spin resistant. However, it is illegal to use these types of racquet in competition as they are not approved by the ITTF. Some types of rubbers are also not approved. Approved rubbers have the ITTF emblem on the base of the rubber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Table tennis|url=http://www.sizes.com/sports/table_tennis.htm#website|website=www.sizes.com|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assembling ==
;Choices
Players have many choices and variations in rubber sheets on their racquet. Although a racquet may be purchased assembled with rubber by the manufacturer, most serious tournament players will use a custom racquet. A player selects a blank blade (i.e., a racquet without rubber) based on his or her playing style. The type of wood or synthetic layers used to make up the blade will determine the blade's speed. The different types of rubber sheets affect the level of spin, speed, and other specific playing characteristics. Racquet construction and new rubber technology contribute significantly to the amount of deviation from the expected ball flight path.

==Glue and gluing==
Normally, a sheet of rubber is glued to a blade using various table tennis brand glues such as Butterfly, Donic, and DHS. Some glues may work even if it wasn't designed specifically for table tennis, such as Rubber Cement and Tear Mender. The rubber is not removed until it wears out or becomes damaged. In the 1980s, some players developed a new technique with a special glue called [[speed glue]] to apply the rubber every time he played. The glue would help provide more spin and speed by providing a "[[catapult]]" effect. 

The fairly recent development of speed glue speeds up the departure of the ball from the rubber considerably, though at the cost of some ball control on [[touch shot]]s &lt;!-- Note: This seems to be a table tennis term, so please don't change it to "tough" which is what I thought it should be until I Googled the term. --&gt; where little or no spin is put on the ball.  Speed glue was allowed for the last time in the [[2008 Summer Olympics]]. From the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] onward, the Olympic games banned speed glue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tabletennis.about.com/od/speedglue/a/ban_speedglue.htm  ITTF Bans Speed Glue, Boosters and Tuners - and Much More!] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402105148/http://tabletennis.about.com/od/speedglue/a/ban_speedglue.htm |date=2015-04-02 }} By Greg Letts, About.com. Accessed September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Maintaining and protection ==
The surface of a racquet will develop a smooth glossy [[patina]] with use. The rubber surface needs regular cleaning to retain a high friction surface for ball spin. Commercial cleaners or water and soap can be cleaning agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.megaspin.net/info/equip.asp|title= Table Tennis Information - Equipment maintenance|accessdate=2007-07-10 |last=|first=|authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Megaspin |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sun exposure may damage the rubber.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44612">'''Three-peat''' is a term used primarily in American sports to refer to winning three consecutive championships. The term, a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''three'' and ''repeat'', originated with the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] of the [[National Basketball Association]], during their unsuccessful campaign for a third consecutive championship during the [[1988–89 NBA season|1988–89 season]], having won the previous 2 NBA Finals in 1987 and 1988 against the [[Boston Celtics]] and [[Detroit Pistons]], but were swept by the Pistons in the 1989 NBA Finals. The term is a [[registered trademark]] owned by [[Pat Riley]] (https://www.threepeat.com), the Lakers' head coach from 1981–1990, although it was coined by L.A. player Byron Scott immediately after their victorious championship defense against the [[Detroit Pistons]] in the [[1988 NBA Finals]].

==Origin and trademark==
In a comedic context, the same play on words, additionally incorporating the name "[[Peter (name)|Pete]]", is known to have been used as early as 1930 on the radio program "[[Empire Builders]]!" The episode of that program broadcast on December 29, 1930, featured a trio of singers dubbed "The Three Visiting Firemen: Pete, Re-Pete, and Three-Pete".&lt;ref&gt;[http://radiomemories.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=23248 Wizzard Media]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] credits an [[Illinois]] high school senior, Sharif Ford, with the earliest published use of the word in the March 8, 1989 edition of the [[St. Louis Post-Dispatch|St. Louis ''Post-Dispatch'']]. Ford's quote uses the term in a sporting context and serves to provide a clear [[etymology]] as well:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Lincoln High Tigers say they want to "three-peat". "You know, kind of like repeat, except doing it for the third time", senior Sharif Ford said.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
However, Riles &amp; Co., the corporate entity of [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) coach [[Pat Riley]], submitted in November 1988 a [[trademark]] application for the use of ''three-peat'' on shirts, jackets and hats. At the time, the phrase was being used by members and fans of the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] [[basketball]] team, of whom Riley was the head coach, regarding the Lakers' quest that season to obtain what would have been a third successive NBA championship. According to Riley, it was Laker player [[Byron Scott (basketball)|Byron Scott]] who coined the term in reference to the team's goal for that season.

In 1989, Riles &amp; Co. successfully registered the trademark under U.S. Registration Number 1552980. The Lakers did not win a third consecutive NBA championship in [[1988–89 NBA season|1989]], but the [[Chicago Bulls]] did in [[1992–93 NBA season|1993]], and Riles &amp; Co. collected royalties from sports apparel makers who licensed the phrase for use on merchandise commemorating that accomplishment.

Riles &amp; Co. subsequently obtained additional registrations expanding the trademark to cover many other kinds of merchandise in addition to apparel. The company then went on to reap additional profits by again licensing the phrase to merchandisers when the Bulls again won three consecutive NBA championships from [[1995–96 NBA season|1996]] through [[1997–98 NBA season|1998]], as well as when the [[New York Yankees]] won three straight [[World Series]] championships from [[1998 in baseball|1998]] through [[2000 in baseball|2000]] and when the Lakers won three straight NBA championships from [[1999–2000 NBA season|2000]] through [[2001–02 NBA season|2002]].

The trademark registration for ''three-peat'' has been challenged over the years by those who argue that the term has become too generic in its usage for the trademark to continue to be applicable. However, such arguments have yet to succeed, with the registration continuing to be upheld by the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] as recently as 2001, in the case of Christopher Wade v. Riles &amp; Co.

In 2005, a group of individuals attempted to trademark the phrase ''Three-Pete'' in anticipation of the (ultimately unsuccessful) attempt that year by the [[2005 USC Trojans football team|University of Southern California (U.S.C.) football team]] to win a third consecutive national championship. The change in spelling was a reference to the team's head coach, [[Pete Carroll]]. However, the Patent Office ruled that the change in spelling was not dissimilar enough from Riles &amp; Co.'s ''three-peat'', and denied the registration. Later that year, U.S.C. fan Kyle Bunch began selling his own "Three-Pete" T-shirts. He discontinued sales once he was notified that he was infringing upon the Riles &amp; Co. trademark.

As of late 2007, the trademark "Three Peat" is still active for shirts, jackets, caps, etc., and for commemorative mugs, plates, etc., and also for posters, bumper sticker, etc. The similar "3 Peat" became a registered trademark of Riles &amp; Co. for blankets and other bedding, as of June 2015. Some of the Riles &amp; Co. trademarks are no longer in effect, e.g. keychains.

==Occurrences of three-peats==
There have been numerous instances of teams winning three or more consecutive championships in the [[National Basketball Association]], [[National Hockey League]], [[Major League Baseball]] and [[Australian Football League]] most of which occurred prior to the advent of the term ''three-peat''.

==The National Football League==
In the [[National Football League]] (NFL), a [[Super Bowl]] championship three-peat has not been accomplished.  Two-time defending Super Bowl champions who failed to three-peat include the [[Green Bay Packers]] ([[1968 NFL season|1968]]), [[Miami Dolphins]] ([[1974 NFL season|1974]]), [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] (twice: [[1976 NFL season|1976]], [[1980 NFL season|1980]]), [[San Francisco 49ers]] ([[1990 NFL season|1990]]), [[Dallas Cowboys]] ([[1994 NFL season|1994]]), [[Denver Broncos]] ([[1999 NFL season|1999]]), and [[New England Patriots]] ([[2005 NFL season|2005]]).  All of these teams failed to return to the title game in the third season (indicated in parentheses).

The [[Buffalo Bills]] went to 4 consecutive Super Bowls from 1990–1993 which is a feat unmatched in NFL history, however they lost in every appearance.

In the early years of the NFL, decades before the introduction of either the term ''three-peat'' or the [[Super Bowl]], the [[Green Bay Packers|Packers]] won three consecutive NFL titles from [[1929 NFL season|1929]]&amp;ndash;[[1931 NFL season|31]].  This was achieved without playing any postseason playoff games, as the league title was determined at that time from the season standings.  In addition, the Packers won the NFL championship in 1965, at a time when the rival NFL and AFL played separate exclusive championships.  They then followed that 1965 championship with their first two Super Bowl victories in 1966 and 1967 (their Super Bowl berths were earned by winning both the [[1966 NFL Championship Game]] and [[1967 NFL Championship Game]]), thereby winning championships three years in a row.

==Related terms==
There have been efforts to come up with a similarly clever name for the potential fourth consecutive championship in the year following a three-peat. But attempts such as ''quat-row'' have thus far failed to catch on, and most fans simply use the term ''four-peat''. Since the term ''three-peat'' came into usage, however, only one team in major American sports has been able to achieve it – [[Hendrick Motorsports|Hendrick Racing]]/[[Jimmie Johnson]] [[NASCAR]] team, who won 5 championships in a row.

The wordplay of ''three-peat'' is clearer if  ''repeat'' is [[lexical stress|stress]]ed on the first [[syllable]]; this pronunciation is uncommon outside North America. Other English-speaking people may instead talk of a [[hat trick]] of championships, or simply a three-in-a-row.

There are also terms for winning three trophies in the same season:
*[[Triple Crown (disambiguation)|Triple Crown]] – various sports
*[[Treble (association football)]]
*[[Grand Slam (PBA)|Grand slam]] – [[Philippine Basketball Association]]

Protests during the playing of the [[United States national anthem]] have had many causes, including civil rights, anti-conscription and anti-war, anti-nationalism, and religious reservations. "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" was adopted as the official national anthem by U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] in 1916, and was made the national anthem by a congressional resolution on March 3, 1931. Before that time, protests also occurred when a number of songs were used as unofficial national anthems, including "[[My Country, 'Tis of Thee]]" and "[[Hail, Columbia]]".

==Early examples==
In 1892, three men, including a friend of [[Ida B. Wells]], were [[lynching|lynched]] by a white mob while in police custody in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], in an event known as the [[Peoples Grocery|Peoples Grocery lynching]]. The act sparked a national outcry. At a meeting of one thousand people at Bethel A. M. E. Church, Reverend W. Gaines' call for the crowd to sing the then ''de facto'' national anthem, "[[My Country, 'Tis of Thee]]", but the call was refused, one member of the audience declaring, "I don't want to sing that song until this country is what it claims to be, 'sweet land of liberty'".&lt;ref name=sing/&gt; The Reverend substituted the Civil War-era song about the abolitionist martyr, "[[John Brown's Body]]". Well's husband, [[Ferdinand Lee Barnett (Chicago)|Ferdinand L. Barnett]], closed the meeting appealing for calm and a careful response, but also expressing great frustration and concern that the violence against blacks may one day lead to reprisals.&lt;ref name=sing&gt;Wouldn't Sing America," ''The Evening World'' (New York, New York) March 28, 1892, page 3, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6654115/wouldnt_sing_america_the_evening/, Not Their Country, ''The Decatur Herald'' (Decatur, Illinois) March 29, 1892, page 1, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6657652/not_their_country_the_decatur_herald/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early 20th century==
[[File:Goldman.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Emma Goldman]] was imprisoned for two years after opposing conscription in the US during World War I.]]
Refusal to stand during the national anthem became a widespread form of protest during [[World War I]]. In some cases, this was related to protest of [[conscription]].&lt;ref&gt;YMCA Boys Force A Slacker to Salute, The St. Louis Star and Times (St. Louis, Missouri) June 1, 1917, page 3, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116016//&lt;/ref&gt; It was also associated with support for [[Socialism]],&lt;ref&gt;Asked to Resign, The Los Angeles Times (Los Angeles, California) October 30, 1917, page 13, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116078/asked_to_resign_the_los_angeles_times/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Men who Sat While Anthem was Played Escape Fines, Jail, The Oregon Daily Journal (Portland, Oregon) June 18, 1918, page 4, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116139//&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bolshevism]],&lt;ref&gt;Disturbers Cheer the Bolshevists and Show Contempt For Anthem, Harrisburg Telegraph (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania) December 9, 1918, page 16, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116158//&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Communism]]. In one case, supporters of the Communism refused to stand during the song at a trial of [[Emma Goldman]].&lt;ref&gt;Reds Turned Out at Trial of Emma, The Sun (New York, New York) July 7, 1917, page 4, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116037/reds_turned_out_at_trial_of_emma_the/&lt;/ref&gt; The act of protest was very controversial, and many people were highly offended, so that even accidentally remaining seated could result in violence.&lt;ref&gt;Labor Delegates Strike Man who Spurns Anthem, The St. Louis Star and Times (St. Louis, Missouri) December 10, 1917, page 3, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116113//&lt;/ref&gt;

Protests during the anthem continued after World War I. For example, during the build-up towards [[World War II]], a group of students at [[Haverford College]] in [[Philadelphia]] refused to stand because they felt the custom was leading to "rabid nationalism".&lt;ref&gt;Students Refuse to Stand While Anthem is Sung, Wilkes=Barre Evening News (Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania) May 31, 1934, page 21, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116195//&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943 in [[Arizona]] a federal judge ruled that members of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] cannot be suspended from school for refusing to stand during the national anthem.&lt;ref&gt;Judge Rules for Religious Sect in Fight Over National Anthem, The San Bernardino County Sun, (San Bernardino, California) August 30, 1963, page 11, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116227//&lt;/ref&gt;

==1960s and 1970s==

[[File:Jane Fonda 1975d.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jane Fonda]] at an anti-Vietnam War conference in The Hague in January 1975]]
In the 1960s, refusal to stand during the anthem took place for a number of reasons. In the late 1960s, the protest became increasingly common among athletes and at schools, both as a protest of the [[Vietnam War]] and as a protest of nationalism. In December 1968, Chris Wood, co-captain of the [[Adelbert College]] basketball team was removed from the team for not standing, saying, "We believe in the fellowship of man. We don't believe in nationalism."&lt;ref&gt;Didn't Stand For Anthem, Is Dismissed, El Paso Herald-Post (el Paso, Texas) December 11, 1968, page 24, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116260//&lt;/ref&gt; Five white high school students were suspended in [[Cumberland, Maryland]] in February 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Suspend Students Refusing to Stand for Pledge, Anthem, The Daily Courier (Connellsville, Pennsylvania) February 25, 1970, page 19, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116277//&lt;/ref&gt; A federal judge [[Joseph P. Kinneary]] ordered reinstatement of a pair of students in Columbus, Ohio, saying that forcing anyone to participate in "symbolic patriotic ceremonies" against their will was a violation of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment to the US Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthem Protest Pair Reinstated, Lubbuck Avalanche-Journal (Lubbock, Texas (July 8, 1970), page 75, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116307/anthem_protest_pair_reinstated_lubbuck/&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1970, [[Kaye Stevens]] refused to sing the national anthem before a [[NFL]] game between the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and [[Kansas City Chiefs]], although she had sung the previous week when the Steelers played the [[New York Jets]]. She said she was protesting the Steelers planned expenditure of $37 million on the new [[Three Rivers Stadium]] when local officials were underfunding treatment for drug users.&lt;ref&gt;Refuses to Sing Anthem, Traverse City Record-Eagle (Traverse City, Michigan) November 14, 1970, page 13, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116365//&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1968 onwards, [[Jimi Hendrix]] performed an instrumental version using feedback, distortion and other effects to deconstruct the music with the sonic images of rockets and bombs. Common interpretations link this to a protest against the [[Vietnam War]], opposed to Hendrix own explanation: "We're all Americans&amp;nbsp;... it was like 'Go America!'...&amp;nbsp;We play it the way the air is in America today. The air is slightly static, see".{{sfn|Cross|2005|p=271}}

[[Donald Sutherland]], [[Gary Goodrow]], [[Peter Boyle]], and [[Jane Fonda]] developed an anti-war comedy show which featured a skit about people refusing to stand during the anthem which toured about 20 cities in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Anti-War Show has SRO Crowd, The Troy Record (Troy, New York) March 15, 1927, page 1, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116407/antiwar_show_has_sro_crowd_the_troy/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil rights movement===
At the same time, Civil Rights became an important cause which led to anthem protests. The [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute]] was a political demonstration conducted by [[African-American]] athletes [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]] during their medal ceremony at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in the [[Estadio Olímpico Universitario|Olympic Stadium]] in [[Mexico City]]. After having won gold and bronze medals, respectively, in the [[200 metres at the Olympics|200 meter]] running event, they turned on the podium to face their flags, and to hear the American national anthem, "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]". Each athlete [[Raised fist|raised a black-gloved fist]], and kept them raised until the anthem had finished. In addition, Smith, Carlos, and Australian silver medalist [[Peter Norman]] all wore human rights badges on their jackets. In his autobiography, ''Silent Gesture'', Smith stated that the gesture was not a "[[Black Power]]" salute, but a "human rights salute". The event is regarded as one of the most overtly political statements in the history of the modern [[Olympic Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2094-2393575,00.html |work=The Sunday Times |location=London |last=Lewis |first=Richard |date=8 October 2006 |title=Caught in Time: Black Power salute, Mexico, 1968 |accessdate=9 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, [[University of Wyoming]] coach [[Lloyd Eaton]] dismissed 14 black football players who requested to wear black armbands to protest the racial slurs they faced during games, particularly against [[BYU]]. When the two teams played in 1971, about 50 students at UW refused to stand during the national anthem and wore black armbands during the game.&lt;ref&gt;Wyoming President Says Black 14 Issues Remain, The Daily Herald (Provo, Utah) October 21, 1971, page 19, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116500//&lt;/ref&gt; Another place where African Americans refused to stand during the anthem in 1971 was at [[Northern Illinois University]] basketball games, which led to widespread criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Banning Anthem Discraceful Action, Belvidere Daily Republican (Belvidere, Illinois) December 20, 1971, page 6, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116534//&lt;/ref&gt;

The protests became widespread, and in some cases, arrangements were made for the anthem to be played before athletes left the locker room. Lew Alcindor, later known as [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], began to refuse to stand at [[UCLA]] basketball games, and in response the anthem was played before the players left the locker room in the UCLA-[[University of Washington]] game.&lt;ref&gt;Walt Brown, Athletes, Celebrities Personal Moments: The 60s and 70s, AuthorHouse, Mar 10, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The same was done when the five starters of [[Florida State University]]'s basketball team, all African American, played [[Tulane University]] in 1971 in [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref&gt;FSU Starters Refuse to Stand for Anthem, Albuquerque Journal (Albuquerque, New Mexico) January 14, 1971, page 25, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116445//&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vincent_Matthews_1968.jpg|thumb|[[Vincent Matthews (athlete)|Vincent Matthews]] in 1968]]
During the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in [[Munich]], [[Vincent Matthews (athlete)|Vincent Matthews]] of [[New York City]] and [[Wayne Collett]] of [[Santa Monica, California]] came in first and second in the 400 meter race. The pair refused to stand at attention on the victory stand to boos and whistles from the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;Athletes Disregard National Anthem, The Bonham Daily Favorite (Bonham, Texas) September 8, 1972, page 5, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116591//&lt;/ref&gt; The pair were barred from running in the 1,600 meter relay later in the games.&lt;ref&gt;Two US Athletes Barred From Further Olympic Actions, Traverse City Record-Eagle (Traverse City, Michigan) September 8, 1972, page 14, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116613//&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil rights based protests continued into the late 1970s, In 1978, a student was barred from receiving his diploma in [[Dayton, Ohio]] for refusing to sing.&lt;ref&gt;Won't Sing Anthem, so no Diploma, The Pantagraph (Bloomington, Illinois) June 4, 1978, page 10, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116628/wont_sing_anthem_so_no_diploma_the/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turn of the millennium==
On August 24, 1990, Irish pop singer [[Sinead O'Connor]] threatened to boycott her scheduled performance that night at the [[Garden State Arts Center]] in [[Holmdel Township, New Jersey]], if the U.S. national anthem were played. In her own words, she explained,

{{blockquote|I sincerely harbor no disrespect for America or Americans, but I have a policy of not having any national anthems played before my concerts in any country, including my own, because they have nothing to do with music in general...I am concerned though, because today, we're seeing other artists arrested at their own concerts...There is a disturbing trend towards censorship of music and art in this country and people should be alarmed over that far more than my actions...}}

The Center gave in to her demands, but not without controversy. [[Frank Sinatra]] criticized her the following evening while performing at the same venue, stating that he wished that he could "kick her in the ass." [[New York state]] Senator Nicholas Spano urged people to boycott O'Connor's subsequent show in [[Saratoga, New York|Saratoga]], saying "I'm sure Ms. O'Connor would be the first to complain if someone tried to censor her performance, yet she is trying to censor the national anthem by refusing to perform where it is played."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Legislator Urges Boycott Over Sinead's Anthem Ban|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-08-28/entertainment/ca-409_1_national-anthem|accessdate=September 28, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|agency=Times Wire Services|publisher=Times-Mirror Co.|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, there was protest in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], when [[Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf]], guard for the [[Denver Nuggets]], refused to stand during the anthem before games in protest of [[Criticism of Islam|anti-Islamic]] rhetoric. He was suspended for his actions and received hostile responses and death threats, but the issue receiving widespread attention.&lt;ref name=Hostile&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/09/sports/rodriguez-yankees-home-hostile-home.html?pagewanted=2&amp;ref=sports&amp;pagewanted=all Home, Hostile Home], ''[[New York Times]]'' (August 8, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jim Hodges|title=NBA Sits Abdul-Rauf for Stance on Anthem|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-03-13/sports/sp-46409_1_mahmoud-abdul-rauf|date=March 13, 1996|accessdate=December 6, 2016|work=The Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Sarah J. Black Celebrity, Racial Politics, and the Press: Framing Dissent. Routledge, 2014. p117-118&lt;/ref&gt; It was noted that at the same time [[Sam Perkins]], who played for the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], is a [[Jehovah's Witness]] who refuse to pledge allegiance to any government; he stood apart from his teammates during the national anthem. [[George Shinn]], owner of the [[Charlotte Hornets]], threatened to trade any player who refused to stand.&lt;ref&gt;[[McCallum, Jack]], [https://www.si.com/vault/1996/03/25/211232/oh-say-should-we-sing-playing-the-national-anthem-is-a-vestige-of-wartime-fervor-so-why-is-it-still-a-part-of-us-sports-events "Oh Say Should We Sing?"] ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', March 25, 1996, accessed October 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abrams2013"&gt;Abrams, Roger I.

UPNE, 2013. p4&lt;/ref&gt; After his suspension, Abdul-Rauf stood, but with his head bowed in silent prayer.&lt;ref&gt;Abrams 2014, p 125&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, two women's basketball players, Toni Smith of [[Manhattanville College]] and Deidra Chatman of the [[Virginia Cavaliers women's basketball|University of Virginia]], made headlines for refusing to face the flag during the national anthem. Chatman, a Jehovah's Witness, protested for one game in March 2003 due to her anti-war views in light of the then-current tensions between the U.S. and [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reedy|first1=Jim|title=U-Va.

During one of her team's games on February 23, 2003, a fan named Jerry Kiley, a self-described [[Vietnam conflict|Vietnam]] veteran, ran onto the court and confronted her with an American flag, saying, "She has not earned the right to disrespect the flag."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pennington|first1=Bill|title=Player's Protest Over the Flag Divides Fans|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/26/sports/college-basketball-player-s-protest-over-the-flag-divides-fans.html|accessdate=September 28, 2017|work=New York Times|publisher=NY Times Company|date=February 26, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[Carlos Delgado]] of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] [[Major League Baseball]] team decided he would no longer stand during the song, "God Bless America" out of protest at America's wars in the Middle East.&lt;ref name="Abrams2013"/&gt;

==2016–present==
{{main|U.S. national anthem protests (2016–present)}}
[[File:Colin Kaepernick in 2013.jpg|thumb|[[Colin Kaepernick]] in 2013]]
During 2016, several professional athletes protested [[police brutality]] during the [[United States]] (U.S.) [[The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem]]. The protests began in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) after [[San Francisco 49ers]] [[quarterback]] (QB) [[Colin Kaepernick]] sat during the anthem, as opposed to the tradition of standing, before his team's third [[National Football League preseason|preseason]] game of [[2016 NFL season|2016]]. Kaepernick also sat during the first two preseason games, but he went unnoticed.&lt;ref name="SB"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sandritter|first1=Mark|title=A timeline of Colin Kaepernick's national anthem protest and the NFL players who joined him|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2016/9/11/12869726/colin-kaepernick-national-anthem-protest-seahawks-brandon-marshall-nfl|publisher=SB Nation|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protests have generated mixed reactions and have since spread to other U.S. sports leagues.

Stemming from the Kaepernick controversy, before the beginning of the [[2016 World Cup of Hockey]] tournament in [[Toronto|Toronto, Canada]], Team USA coach [[John Tortorella]] told in an interview that if any one of his players were to sit out during the anthem, they would sit on the bench for the entire duration of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/world-cup-of-hockey/tortorella-will-sit-anthem-protests-team-usa/|title=Tortorella 'will sit' any Team USA player who protests anthem - Sportsnet.ca|newspaper=Sportsnet.ca|access-date=2017-02-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology ==
[[File:Shiva Bangalore .jpg|thumb|right|Statue of [[Shiva]] in [[Bangalore]], [[Karnataka]], [[India]], performing yogic meditation in the [[Lotus position|Padmasana]] posture.]]

The [[Sanskrit]] noun ''{{IAST|yoga}}'' is cognate with English "[[yoke]]". It is derived from the 
root ''{{IAST|[[:wiktionary:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/yewg-|yuj]]}}'' "to attach, join, harness, yoke".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Swami Satyananda Saraswati |authorlink=Swami Satyananda Saraswati |title=Asana Pranayama Mudra Bandha  |publisher=Yoga Publications Trust |location=Munger, Bihar, India |year=1996 |isbn=978-81-86336-14-4 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spiritual sense of the word ''[[Yoga (philosophy)|yoga]]'' first arises in [[Epic Sanskrit]], in the second half of the 1st millennium BCE, and is associated with the philosophical system presented in the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]],
with the chief aim of "uniting" the human spirit with the  [[īśvara|Divine]].&lt;ref&gt;"application or concentration of the thoughts, abstract contemplation, meditation , (esp.) self-concentration, abstract meditation and mental abstraction practised as a system (as taught by Patañjali and called the yoga philosophy; it is the second of the two sāṃkhya systems,  its chief aim being to teach the means by which the human spirit may attain complete union with īśvara or the Supreme Spirit; in the practice of self-concentration it is closely connected with Buddhism". Monier-Williams, ''A Sanskrit Dictionary'' (1899)&lt;/ref&gt;
The term ''[[kriyā]]yoga'' has a technical meaning in the ''Yoga Sutras'' (2.1), designating the "practical" aspects of the philosophy, i.e. the "union with the supreme" due to performance of duties in everyday life&lt;ref&gt;Whicher, pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Pāṇini]],  the term yoga can be derived from either of two roots, ''yujir yoga'' (to yoke) or ''yuj samādhau'' ("to concentrate").&lt;ref name="Dasgupta 1975 226" /&gt; In the context of the ''Yoga Sutras of Patanjali'', the root ''yuj samādhau'' (to concentrate) is considered by traditional commentators as the correct etymology.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant 2009, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with Pāṇini, [[Vyasa]] who wrote the first commentary on the ''Yoga Sutras'',&lt;ref&gt;Bryant 2009, p. xxxix.&lt;/ref&gt; states that yoga means ''[[Samadhi|samādhi]]'' (concentration).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aranya |first=Swami Hariharananda |authorlink=Swami Hariharananda Aranya |title=Yoga Philosophy of Patanjali with Bhasvati |year=2000 |publisher=[[University of Calcutta]]|location=Calcutta, India |isbn=81-87594-00-4|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dasgupta, the term yoga can be derived from either of two roots, ''yujir yoga'' ("to yoke") or ''yuj samādhau'' ("to concentrate").&lt;ref name="Dasgupta 1975 226"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dasgupta |first=Surendranath |title=A History of Indian Philosophy | volume =1 |year=1975 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |location=[[Delhi]], India |isbn=81-208-0412-0 |page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Someone who practices yoga or follows the yoga philosophy with a high level of commitment is called a [[yogi]] (may be applied to a man or a woman) or [[yogini]] (a woman).&lt;ref&gt;American Heritage Dictionary: "Yogi, One who practices yoga." Websters: "Yogi, A follower of the yoga philosophy; an ascetic."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition in classic Indian texts==
The term yoga has been defined in various ways in the many different Indian philosophical and religious traditions.

== Goals ==
The ultimate goal of Yoga is ''[[moksha]]'' (liberation), although the exact definition of what form this takes depends on the philosophical or theological system with which it is conjugated.

According to Jacobsen, Yoga has five principal meanings:&lt;ref name="Jacobsen4" /&gt;
# a disciplined method for attaining a goal;
# techniques of controlling the body and the mind;
# a name of a school or system of philosophy (''{{IAST|darśana}}'');
# with prefixes such as "hatha-, mantra-, and laya-, traditions specialising in particular techniques of yoga;
# the goal of Yoga practice.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen4"&gt;Jacobsen, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to David Gordon White, from the 5th century CE onward, the core principles of "yoga" were more or less in place, and variations of these principles developed in various forms over time:{{sfn|White|2011|p=6}}

# a meditative means of discovering dysfunctional perception and cognition, as well as overcoming it for release from suffering, inner peace and salvation; illustration of this principle is found in Hindu texts such as the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' and ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yogasutras]]'', in a number of Buddhist Mahāyāna works, as well as Jain texts;{{sfn|White|2011|pp=6–8}}
# the raising and expansion of consciousness from oneself to being coextensive with everyone and everything; these are discussed in sources such as in Hinduism Vedic literature and its Epic ''[[Mahābhārata]]'', Jainism Praśamaratiprakarana, and Buddhist Nikaya texts;{{sfn|White|2011|pp=8–9}}
# a path to omniscience and enlightened consciousness enabling one to comprehend the impermanent (illusive, delusive) and permanent (true, transcendent) reality; examples are found in Hinduism [[Nyaya]] and [[Vaisesika]] school texts as well as Buddhism Mādhyamaka texts, but in different ways;{{sfn|White|2011|pp=9–10}}
# a technique for entering into other bodies, generating multiple bodies, and the attainment of other supernatural accomplishments; these are, states White, described in [[Tantra|Tantric]] literature of Hinduism and Buddhism, as well as the Buddhist Sāmaññaphalasutta;{{sfn|White|2011|pp=10–12}} James Mallinson, however, disagrees and suggests that such fringe practices are far removed from the mainstream Yoga's goal as meditation-driven means to liberation in Indian religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Mallinson | first=James | title=The Yogīs' Latest Trick | journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society | publisher=Cambridge University Press (CUP) | volume=24 | issue=1 | year=2013 | pages=165–180 | doi=10.1017/s1356186313000734 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

White clarifies that the last principle relates to legendary goals of "yogi practice", different from practical goals of "yoga practice," as they are viewed in South Asian thought and practice since the beginning of the Common Era, in the various Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain philosophical schools.{{sfn|White|2011|p=11}}

== Schools ==
Yoga is practised with a variety of methods, including by Jains and Buddhists. In Hinduism, practices include [[Jnana yoga|Jnana Yoga]], [[Bhakti yoga|Bhakti Yoga]], [[Karma yoga|Karma Yoga]], [[Laya yoga|Laya Yoga]] and [[Hatha yoga|Hatha Yoga]].

Raja yoga originally denoted the ultimate goal of yoga, ''samadhi'',{{sfn|Mallinson|2011|p=770}} but was popularised by Vivekananda as the common name for Ashtanga Yoga, the eight limbs to be practised to attain [[samadhi]], as described in the ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]''.{{sfn|Hari Dass|1978}}{{sfn|White|2014|p=xvi}}

=== Hinduism ===

==== Classical yoga ====
{{main|Yoga (philosophy)}}
Yoga is considered as a philosophical school in Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]], Indian Philosophy, London, George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1971, Volume II, pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Yoga, in this context, is one of the six ''[[Āstika and nāstika|āstika]]'' schools of Hinduism (those which accept the Vedas as source of knowledge).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Flood|1996|pp=82, 224–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DTPJpanTizwC&amp;pg=PA446&amp;dq=yoga+is+one+of+the+six+astika+schools+of+hindu+philosophy#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Changing World Religions, Cults &amp; Occult |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the influence of Vivekananda, the ''Yoga Sutras of Patanjali'' have since the 20th century been considered the foundational scripture of classical yoga.{{sfn|White|2014|p=xvi}} Before then, other works such as the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' and the ''[[Yoga Vasistha]]'' were considered the most central,{{sfn|White|2014|p=xvi}} while Tantric Yoga and Hatha Yoga prevailed over Ashtanga Yoga.{{sfn|White|2014|p=xvi}}

==== Ashtanga yoga ====
{{Main|Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Rāja yoga}}
[[File:Swami Vivekananda 1896.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Swami Vivekananda]] equated raja yoga with the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali.&lt;ref name=vivekarajayoga&gt;Swami Vivekananda, Raja Yoga, {{ISBN|978-1500746940}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Yoga as described in the ''Yoga Sutras of Patanjali'' refers to Ashtanga yoga.{{sfn|White|2014|p=xvi}} The ''Yoga Sutras of Patanjali'' is considered as a central text of the Yoga school of Hindu philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;Whicher, pp. 41–43&lt;/ref&gt; It is often called "Rāja yoga", "yoga of the kings," a term which originally referred to the ultimate, royal goal of yoga, which is usually ''samadhi'',{{sfn|Mallinson|2011|p=770}} but was popularised by Vivekananda as the common name for Ashtanga Yoga.{{sfn|White|2014|p=xvi}}

Ashtanga yoga incorporates epistemology, metaphysics, ethical practices, systematic exercises and self-development techniques for body, mind and spirit.&lt;ref name=edbryant /&gt; Its [[epistemology]] (''[[pramana]]s'') is same as the [[Samkhya]] school. Both accept three reliable means to knowledge – perception (''pratyākṣa'', direct sensory observations), inference (''anumāna'') and testimony of trustworthy experts (''sabda'', agama). Both these orthodox schools are also strongly [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualistic]]. Unlike the Sāṃkhya school of Hinduism, which pursues a non-theistic/atheistic rationalist approach,&lt;ref name=lpfl&gt;Lloyd Pflueger, Person Purity and Power in Yogasutra, in Theory and Practice of Yoga (Editor: Knut Jacobsen), Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, pages 38–39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mike Burley (2012), Classical Samkhya and Yoga – An Indian Metaphysics of Experience, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-64887-5}}, pages 43–46&lt;/ref&gt; the Yoga school of Hinduism accepts the concept of a "personal, yet essentially inactive, deity" or "personal god".&lt;ref&gt;Kovoor T. Behanan (2002), Yoga: Its Scientific Basis, Dover, {{ISBN|978-0-486-41792-9}}, pages 56–58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mike Burley (2012), Classical Samkhya and Yoga – An Indian Metaphysics of Experience, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-64887-5}}, page 39, 41&lt;/ref&gt; Along with its epistemology and metaphysical foundations, the Yoga school of Hindu philosophy incorporates ethical precepts (''[[yamas]]'' and ''[[niyama]]s'') and an introspective way of life focused on perfecting one's self physically, mentally and spiritually, with the ultimate goal being ''kaivalya'' (liberated, unified, content state of existence).&lt;ref name=edbryant /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mike Burley (2012), Classical Samkhya and Yoga – An Indian Metaphysics of Experience, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-64887-5}}, pages 38–46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wade Dazey (2008) on pages 421–423, and Lloyd Pflueger on pages 46–52, in Theory and Practice of Yoga : 'Essays in Honour of Gerald James Larson, Editor: Knut A.

Hatha yoga, also called hatha [[vidyā]], is a kind of yoga focusing on physical and mental strength building exercises and postures described primarily in three texts of [[Hinduism]]:&lt;ref name=kriyananda&gt;See Kriyananada, page 112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=burley73&gt;See Burley, page 73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Roden&gt;See Introduction by Rosen, pp 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''[[Gheranda Samhita]]'' by Gheranda (late 17th century)

Many scholars also include the ''Goraksha Samhita'' by [[Gorakshanath]] of the 11th century in the above list.&lt;ref name=kriyananda /&gt; Gorakshanath is widely considered to have been responsible for popularizing hatha yoga as we know it today.&lt;ref name=dwhite&gt;On page 140, David Gordon White says of Gorakshanath: "... hatha yoga, in which field he was India's major systematizer and innovator."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bajpai&gt;Bajpai writes on page 524: "Nobody can dispute about the top ranking position of Sage Gorakshanath in the philosophy of Yoga."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eliade&gt;Eliade writes of Gorakshanath on page 303: "...he accomplished a new synthesis among certain Shaivist traditions (Pashupata), tantrism, and the doctrines (unfortunately, so imperfectly known) of the siddhas&amp;nbsp;– that is, of the perfect yogis."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vajrayana]] Buddhism, founded by the Indian [[Mahasiddha]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Ronald. ''Indian Esoteric Buddhism.'' Columbia University Press. 2002, pg.169–235.&lt;/ref&gt; has a series of asanas and pranayamas, such as [[tummo]] (Sanskrit ''caṇḍālī'')&lt;ref name="Lama Yeshe 1998, pg.135–141" /&gt; and [[trul khor]] which parallel hatha yoga.

==== Shaivism ====

In [[Shaivism]], yoga is used to unite ''[[kundalini]]'' with [[Shiva]].&lt;ref&gt;Larson, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; See also 'tantra' below.

=== Buddhism ===

[[File:'Bodhisattva Manjusri and Prajnaparamita', Nepal, c. 1575, Norton Simon Museum.JPG|thumb|180px|16th century Buddhist artwork in Yoga posture.]]
Buddhist meditation encompasses a variety of [[meditation]] techniques that aim to develop [[Sati (Buddhism)|mindfulness]], [[Samadhi (Buddhism)|concentration]], [[Abhijñā|supramundane powers]], [[samatha|tranquility]], and [[vipassanā|insight]].

Core techniques have been preserved in ancient [[Buddhist texts]] and have proliferated and diversified through teacher-student transmissions. [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] pursue meditation as part of the path toward [[Bodhi|Enlightenment]] and [[Nirvana]].{{refn|group=note|For instance, Kamalashila (2003), p. 4, states that Buddhist meditation "includes any method of meditation that has [[Bodhi|Enlightenment]] as its ''ultimate'' aim." Likewise, Bodhi (1999) writes: "To arrive at the experiential realization of the truths it is necessary to take up the practice of meditation.... At the climax of such contemplation the mental eye … shifts its focus to the unconditioned state, [[Nirvana|Nibbana]]...."  A similar although in some ways slightly broader definition is provided by Fischer-Schreiber ''et al.'' (1991), p. 142: "'''Meditation''' – general term for a multitude of religious practices, often quite different in method, but all having the same goal: to bring the consciousness of the practitioner to a state in which he can come to an experience of 'awakening,' 'liberation,' 'enlightenment.'"  Kamalashila (2003) further allows that some Buddhist meditations are "of a more preparatory nature" (p. 4).}} The closest words for meditation in the classical languages of Buddhism are ''[[Bhavana|bhāvanā]]''{{refn|group=note|The [[Pāli]] and [[Sanskrit]] word ''bhāvanā'' literally means "development" as in "mental development." For the association of this term with "meditation," see Epstein (1995), p. 105; and, Fischer-Schreiber ''et al.'' (1991), p. 20.  As an example from a well-known discourse of the [[Pali Canon]], in "The Greater Exhortation to Rahula" (''Maha-Rahulovada Sutta'', [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 62), Ven. [[Sariputta]] tells Ven. [[Rahula]] (in Pali, based on [http://www.tipitaka.org/romn/cscd/s0202m.mul1.xml VRI, n.d.)]: ''{{IAST|ānāpānassatiṃ, rāhula, bhāvanaṃ bhāvehi.}}''  [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.062.than.html Thanissaro (2006)] translates this as: "Rahula, develop the meditation [''{{IAST|bhāvana}}''] of [[anapanasati|mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing]]."

[[Pali Text Society|PTS]] Secretary Dr. Rupert Gethin, in describing the activities of [[sramana|wandering ascetics]] contemporaneous with the Buddha, wrote:
:"...[T]here is the cultivation of meditative and contemplative techniques aimed at producing what might, for the lack of a suitable technical term in English, be referred to as 'altered states of consciousness'. In the technical vocabulary of Indian religious texts such states come to be termed 'meditations' ([Skt.:] ''dhyāna'' / [Pali:] ''jhāna'') or 'concentrations'  (''[[samādhi]]''); the attainment of such states of consciousness was generally regarded as bringing the practitioner to deeper knowledge and experience of the nature of the world."

=== Jainism ===

Jain meditation has been the central practice of spirituality in [[Jainism]] along with the [[Ratnatraya|Three Jewels]].&lt;ref name="Ratna traya"&gt;{{cite book|first= Acharya |last=Mahapragya |title=Jain Yog |publisher=Aadarsh Saahitya Sangh |chapter=Foreword |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meditation in Jainism aims at realizing the self, attain salvation, take the soul to complete freedom.&lt;ref name="blessings"&gt;{{cite book |first=Acharya |last=Tulsi |title=Sambodhi |publisher=Aadarsh Saahitya Sangh |url=http://www.adarshsahityasangh.com/BookDetail.aspx?Id=24 |oclc=39811791 |chapter=blessings |year=2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305051429/http://www.adarshsahityasangh.com/bookdetail.aspx?id=24 |archivedate=5 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to reach and to remain in the pure state of soul which is believed to be pure conscious, beyond any attachment or aversion. The practitioner strives to be just a knower-seer (''Gyata-Drashta'').  Jain meditation can be broadly categorized to the auspicious ''Dharmya Dhyana'' and ''Shukla Dhyana'' and inauspicious ''Artta'' and ''Raudra'' Dhyana.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

=== Tantra ===
{{Main|Tantra|Yogi|Siddhi}}
Samuel states that [[Tantrism]] is a contested concept.{{sfn|Samuel|2008|p=9}} Tantra yoga may be described, according to Samuel, as practices in 9th to 10th century Buddhist and Hindu (Saiva, Shakti) texts, which included yogic practices with elaborate deity visualizations using geometrical arrays and drawings ([[mandala]]), fierce male and particularly female deities, transgressive life stage related rituals, extensive use of [[chakra]]s and [[mantra]]s, and sexual techniques, all aimed to help one's health, long life and liberation.{{sfn|Samuel|2008|p=9}}&lt;ref&gt;Mukunda Stiles, Tantra Yoga Secrets, Weiser, {{ISBN|978-1-57863-503-0}}, pages 3–7&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The origins of yoga are a matter of debate.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=87–90}} There is no consensus on its chronology or specific origin other than that yoga developed in ancient India. Suggested origins are the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (3300–1900 BCE){{sfn|Crangle|1994|p=4–7}} and pre-Vedic [[East India|Eastern states of India]],{{sfn|Zimmer|1951|p=217, 314}} the [[Vedic period]] (1500–500 BCE), and the [[śramaṇa]] movement.{{sfn|Samuel|2008}} According to Gavin Flood, continuities may exist between those various traditions:
{{quote|[T]his dichotomization is too simplistic, for continuities can undoubtedly be found between renunciation and vedic Brahmanism, while elements from non-Brahmanical, Sramana traditions also played an important part in the formation of the renunciate ideal.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=77}}{{refn|group=note|Gavin Flood: "These renouncer traditions offered a new vision of the human condition which became incorporated, to some degree, into the worldview of the Brahman householder. The ideology of asceticism and renunciation seems, at first, discontinuous with the brahmanical ideology of the affirmation of social obligations and the performance of public and domestic rituals. Indeed, there has been some debate as to whether asceticism and its ideas of retributive action, reincarnation and spiritual liberation, might not have originated outside the orthodox vedic sphere, or even outside Aryan culture: that a divergent historical origin might account for the apparent contradiction within 'Hinduism' between the world affirmation of the householder and the world negation of the renouncer. However, this dichotomization is too simplistic, for continuities can undoubtedly be found between renunciation and vedic Brahmanism, while elements from non-Brahmanical, Sramana traditions also played an important part in the formation of the renunciate ideal. Indeed there are continuities between vedic Brahmanism and Buddhism, and it has been argued that the Buddha sought to return to the ideals of a vedic society which he saw as being eroded in his own day."{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=76–77}}}}}}

Pre-philosophical speculations of yoga begin to emerge in the texts of {{circa|500|200&amp;nbsp;BCE}}. Between 200&amp;nbsp;BCE and 500&amp;nbsp;CE, philosophical schools of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism were taking form and a coherent philosophical system of yoga began to emerge.&lt;ref name="Larson, p. 36"&gt;Larson, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The Middle Ages saw the development of many satellite traditions of yoga. Yoga came to the attention of an educated western public in the mid 19th century along with other topics of Indian philosophy.

=== Pre-Vedic India ===
{{Main|Indus Valley Civilization}}
Yoga may have pre-Vedic elements.{{sfn|Crangle|1994|p=4–7}}{{sfn|Zimmer|1951|p=217, 314}} Some state yoga originated in the Indus Valley Civilization.{{sfn|Samuel|2008|p=2–3}} Marshall,&lt;ref name="Possehl 2003, pp. 144–145"&gt;Possehl (2003), pp. 144–145&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade&lt;ref name=marksing /&gt; and other scholars suggest that the [[Pashupati seal]] discovered in Indus Valley Civilization sites depict figures in positions resembling a common yoga or meditation pose.

==== Vedic ascetic practices ====
Ascetic practices (''[[Tapas (Sanskrit)|tapas]]''), concentration and bodily postures used by Vedic priests to conduct [[yajna]] (sacrifice), might have been precursors to yoga.{{refn|group=note|
* Jacobsen writes that "Bodily postures are closely related to the tradition of tapas, ascetic practices in the Vedic tradition. The use by Vedic priests of ascetic practices in their preparations for the performance of the sacrifice might be precursor to Yoga."&lt;ref name="Jacobsen6"&gt;Jacobsen, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Whicher believes that "the proto-Yoga of the Vedic rishis is an early form of sacrificial mysticism and contains many elements characteristic of later Yoga that include: concentration, meditative observation, ascetic forms of practice (tapas), breath control..."&lt;ref name="Whicher, p. 12" /&gt;}} ''Vratya'', a group of ascetics mentioned in the ''[[Atharvaveda]]'', emphasized on bodily postures which may have evolved into yogic [[asana]]s.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen6" /&gt; Early [[Samhita]]s also contain references to other group ascetics such as munis, the [[keśin]], and vratyas.&lt;ref name="Flood94"&gt;Flood, p. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt; Techniques for controlling breath and vital energies are mentioned in the [[Brahmana]]s (texts of the Vedic corpus, c. 1000–800 BCE) and the ''Atharvaveda''.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whicher, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nasadiya Sukta]] of the ''Rig Veda'' suggests the presence of an early contemplative tradition.{{refn|group=note|* Wynne states that "The Nasadiyasukta, one of the earliest and most important cosmogonic tracts in the early Brahminic literature, contains evidence suggesting it was closely related to a tradition of early Brahminic contemplation. A close reading of this text suggests that it was closely related to a tradition of early Brahminic contemplation. The poem may have been composed by contemplatives, but even if not, an argument can be made that it marks the beginning of the contemplative/meditative trend in Indian thought."&lt;ref&gt;Wynne, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Miller suggests that the composition of Nasadiya Sukta and ''[[Purusha Sukta]]'' arises from "the subtlest meditative stage, called absorption in mind and heart" which "involves enheightened experiences" through which seer "explores the mysterious psychic and cosmic forces...".&lt;ref name="Whicher11"&gt;Whicher, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preclassical era (500–200 BCE) ===
Yoga concepts begin to emerge in the texts of c. 500–200 BCE such as the Pali Canon, the middle Upanishads, the ''Bhagavad Gita'' and ''[[Shanti Parva]]'' of the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, p. 34–35, 53.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Ancient Indian literature was transmitted and preserved through an [[oral tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wynne|first1=Alexander|title=The Oral Transmission of the Early Buddhist Literature|journal=Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies|date=2004|volume=27|issue=1|pages=97–128|url=http://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/view/8945/2838}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the earliest written Pali Canon text is dated to the later part of 1st century BCE, many centuries after the Buddha's death.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Lopez (2004).

The hymns in Book 2 of the ''[[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]]'', another late first millennium BCE text, states a procedure in which the body is held in upright posture, the breath is restrained and mind is meditatively focussed, preferably inside a cave or a place that is simple, plain, of silence or gently flowing water, with no noises nor harsh winds.&lt;ref&gt;See: Original Sanskrit: [http://sanskritdocuments.org/all_pdf/shveta.pdf Shvetashvatara Upanishad] Book 2, Hymns 8–14;&lt;br /&gt; English Translation: [[Paul Deussen]] (German: 1897; English Translated by Bedekar &amp; Palsule, Reprint: 2010), Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Vol 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814677}}, pages 309–310&lt;br /&gt; Secondary Source Review: Mark Singleton (2010), Yoga Body: The Origins of Modern Posture Practice, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-539534-1}}, page 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacobsen8" /&gt;

The ''[[Maitrayaniya Upanishad]]'', likely composed in a later century than ''Katha'' and ''Shvetashvatara Upanishads'' but before Patanjali's Yoga Sutra, mentions sixfold yoga method – breath control (''pranayama''), introspective withdrawal of senses (''pratyahara''), meditation (''dhyana''), mind concentration (''dharana''), philosophical inquiry/creative reasoning (''tarka''), and absorption/intense spiritual union (''samadhi'').&lt;ref name=marksing /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacobsen8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Introducing Yoga's Great Literary Heritage | last=Feuerstein|first= Georg | journal=[[Yoga Journal]] |date=January–February 1988 | issue=78|authorlink=Georg Feuerstein|pages=70–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Macedonian historical texts ====
[[Alexander the Great]] reached India in the 4th century BCE. Along with his army, he took Greek academics with him who later wrote memoirs about geography, people and customs they saw. One of Alexander's companion was [[Onesicritus]], quoted in Book 15, Sections 63–65 by [[Strabo]], who describes yogins of India.&lt;ref name=charlesrl&gt;Charles R Lanman, [https://archive.org/stream/jstor-1507563/1507563#page/n3/mode/2up The Hindu Yoga System], Harvard Theological Review, Volume XI, Number 4, Harvard University Press, pages 355–359&lt;/ref&gt; Onesicritus claims those Indian yogins (''Mandanis '') practiced aloofness and "different postures – standing or sitting or lying naked – and motionless".&lt;ref name=strabo&gt;Strabo, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/15A3*.html#ref101 Geography] Book XV, Chapter 1, see '''Sections 63–65''', Loeb Classical Library edition, Harvard University Press, Translator: HL Jones, Archived by: University of Chicago&lt;/ref&gt;

Onesicritus also mentions his colleague ''Calanus'' trying to meet them, who is initially denied audience, but later invited because he was sent by a "king curious of wisdom and philosophy".&lt;ref name=strabo /&gt; Onesicritus and Calanus learn that the yogins consider the best doctrine of life as "rid the spirit of not only pain, but also pleasure", that "man trains the body for toil in order that his opinions may be strengthened", that "there is no shame in life on frugal fare", and that "the best place to inhabit is one with scantiest equipment or outfit".&lt;ref name=charlesrl /&gt;&lt;ref name=strabo /&gt; These principles are significant to the history of spiritual side of yoga.&lt;ref name=charlesrl /&gt; These may reflect the ancient roots of "undisturbed calmness" and "mindfulness through balance" in later works of Hindu [[Patanjali]] and Buddhist [[Buddhaghosa]] respectively, states [[Charles Rockwell Lanman]];&lt;ref name=charlesrl /&gt; as well as the principle of ''[[Aparigraha]]'' (non-possessiveness, non-craving, simple living) and [[sannyasa|asceticism]] discussed in later Hinduism and Jainism.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==== Early Buddhist texts ====
Werner states, "The Buddha was the founder of his [Yoga] system, even though, admittedly, he made use of some of the experiences he had previously gained under various Yoga teachers of his time."&lt;ref&gt;Karel Werner (1998), Yoga and the Indian Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120816091}}, page 131&lt;/ref&gt; He notes:&lt;ref name="Werner (1977) p. 119–20" /&gt;

{{quote|But it is only with Buddhism itself as expounded in the [[Pali Canon]] that we can speak about a systematic and comprehensive or even integral school of Yoga practice, which is thus the first and oldest to have been preserved for us in its entirety.&lt;ref name="Werner (1977) p. 119–20"&gt;Werner (1977) p. 119–20&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The chronology of completion of these yoga-related Pali Canons, however, is unclear, just like ancient Hindu texts.{{sfn|Samuel|2008|pp=31–32}}&lt;ref&gt;Mark Singleton (2010), Yoga Body: The Origins of Modern Posture Practice, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-539534-1}}, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; Early known Buddhist sources like the ''Majjhima Nikāya'' mention meditation, while the ''Anguttara Nikāya'' describes ''Jhāyins'' (meditators) that resemble early Hindu descriptions of ''Muni'', ''Kesins'' and meditating ascetics,&lt;ref&gt;[[Johannes Bronkhorst|Bronkhorst, Johannes]] (1993), The Two Traditions of Meditation in Ancient India, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120816435}}, pages 1–24&lt;/ref&gt; but these meditation-practices are not called yoga in these texts.{{sfn|White|2011|pp=5–6}} The earliest known specific discussion of yoga in the Buddhist literature, as understood in modern context, is from the third- to fourth-century CE scriptures of the Buddhist Yogācāra school and fourth- to fifth-century [[Visuddhimagga]] of Buddhaghosa.{{sfn|White|2011|pp=5–6}}

A yoga system that predated the Buddhist school is Jain yoga. But since Jain sources postdate Buddhist ones, it is difficult to distinguish between the nature of the early Jain school and elements derived from other schools.&lt;ref name="Werner (1977) p. 119–20" /&gt; Most of the other contemporary yoga systems alluded in the Upanishads and some Pali canons are lost to time.&lt;ref name="Eating disorders"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Douglass|first=Laura|title=Thinking Through The Body: The Conceptualization Of Yoga As Therapy For Individuals With Eating Disorders|journal=Academic Search Premier|year=2011|page=83|url=http://web.ebscohost.com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=3&amp;sid=1d8495be-1c1c-4423-ad48-1f6054f42876%40sessionmgr111&amp;hid=103|accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Datta|first=Amaresh|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: devraj to jyoti|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zB4n3MVozbUC&amp;pg=PA1809|year=1988|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-260-1194-0|page=1809 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|On the dates of the Pali canon, Gregory Schopen writes, "We know, and have known for some time, that the Pali canon as we have it — and it is generally conceded to be our oldest source — cannot be taken back further than the last quarter of the first century BCE, the date of the Alu-vihara redaction, the earliest redaction we can have some knowledge of, and that — for a critical history — it can serve, at the very most, only as a source for the Buddhism of this period. But we also know that even this is problematic... In fact, it is not until the time of the commentaries of Buddhaghosa, Dhammapala, and others — that is to say, the fifth to sixth centuries CE — that we can know anything definite about the actual contents of [the Pali] canon."&lt;ref&gt;Wynne, pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}

The early Buddhist texts describe meditative practices and states, some of which the Buddha borrowed from the śramaṇa tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Gombrich]], "Theravada Buddhism: A Social History from Ancient Benares to Modern Colombo." Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1988, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Stoler Miller, "Yoga: Discipline of Freedom: the Yoga Sutra Attributed to Patanjali; a Translation of the Text, with Commentary, Introduction, and Glossary of Keywords." University of California Press, 1996, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pali canon contains three passages in which the Buddha describes pressing the tongue against the palate for the purposes of controlling hunger or the mind, depending on the passage.&lt;ref&gt;Mallinson, James. 2007. ''The Khecarīvidyā of Adinathā.'' London: Routledge. pg.17–19.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no mention of the tongue being inserted into the [[Pharynx#Nasopharynx|nasopharynx]] as in true [[khecarī mudrā]]. The Buddha used a posture where pressure is put on the perineum with the heel, similar to even modern postures used to stimulate Kundalini.&lt;ref&gt;James Mallinson, "Sāktism and Hathayoga," 6 March 2012. [http://www.khecari.com/resources/SaktismHathayoga.pdf PDF file] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616025645/http://www.khecari.com/resources/SaktismHathayoga.pdf |date=16 June 2013 }} [accessed 10 June 2012] pgs. 20–21 "The Buddha himself is said to have tried both pressing his tongue to the back of his mouth, in a manner similar to that of the hathayogic khecarīmudrā, and ukkutikappadhāna, a [[squatting posture]] which may be related to hathayogic techniques such as mahāmudrā, mahābandha, mahāvedha, mūlabandha, and vajrāsana in which pressure is put on the perineum with the heel, in order to force upwards the breath or Kundalinī."&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Uncertainty with chronology ====
Alexander Wynne, author of ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation'', observes that formless meditation and elemental meditation might have originated in the Upanishadic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Wynne, pp. 44–45,58.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest reference to meditation is in the ''[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]'', one of the oldest Upanishads.&lt;ref name="Flood94" /&gt; ''[[Chandogya Upanishad]]'' describes the five kinds of vital energies (''[[prana]]''). Concepts used later in many yoga traditions such as internal sound and veins (''[[Nadi (yoga)|nadis]]'') are also described in the Upanishad.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen6" /&gt; ''[[Taittiriya Upanishad]]'' defines yoga as the mastery of body and senses.&lt;ref&gt;Whicher, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bhagavad Gita ====
[[File:Bhagavata Gita Bishnupur Arnab Dutta 2011.JPG|thumb|[[Krishna]] narrating the [[Bhagavad Gita|Gita]] to [[Arjuna]]]]
{{Main|Bhagavad Gita}}
The ''Bhagavad Gita'' ('Song of the Lord'), uses the term "yoga" extensively in a variety of ways. In addition to an entire chapter (ch. 6) dedicated to traditional yoga practice, including meditation,&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsen, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; it introduces three prominent types of yoga:&lt;ref&gt;Flood, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Karma yoga]]: The yoga of action.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen, p. 10–11"&gt;Jacobsen, p. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bhakti yoga]]: The yoga of devotion.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen, p. 10–11" /&gt;
* [[Jnana yoga]]: The yoga of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;E. Easwaran, Essence of the Bhagavad Gita, Nilgiri Press, {{ISBN|978-1-58638-068-7}}, pages 117–118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jack Hawley (2011), The Bhagavad Gita, {{ISBN|978-1-60868-014-6}}, pages 50, 130; Arvind Sharma (2000), Classical Hindu Thought: An Introduction, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-564441-8}}, pages 114–122&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gita consists of 18 chapters and 700 ''shlokas'' (verses),&lt;ref name="bibekd"/&gt; with each chapter named as a different yoga, thus delineating eighteen different yogas.&lt;ref name=bibekd /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsen, p. 46.; Georg Feuerstein (2011), The Bhagavad Gita – A New Translation, Shambhala, {{ISBN|978-1-59030-893-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars divide the ''Gita'' into three sections, with the first six chapters with 280 ''shlokas'' dealing with Karma yoga, the middle six containing 209 shlokas with Bhakti yoga, and the last six chapters with 211 shlokas as Jnana yoga; however, this is rough because elements of ''karma'', ''bhakti'' and ''jnana'' are found in all chapters.&lt;ref name=bibekd&gt;Bibek Debroy (2005), The Bhagavad Gita, Penguin Books, {{ISBN|978-0-14-400068-5}}, Introduction, pages x–xi&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mahabharata ====
Description of an early form of yoga called ''nirodhayoga'' (yoga of cessation) is contained in the Mokshadharma section of the 12th chapter (''Shanti Parva'') of the ''Mahabharata''. The verses of the section are dated to c. 300–200 BCE{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}. ''Nirodhayoga'' emphasizes progressive withdrawal from the contents of empirical consciousness such as thoughts, sensations etc. until ''purusha'' (Self) is realized. Terms like ''vichara'' (subtle reflection), ''viveka'' (discrimination) and others which are similar to Patanjali's terminology are mentioned, but not described.&lt;ref&gt;Whicher, p. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no uniform goal of yoga mentioned in the ''Mahabharata''. Separation of self from matter, perceiving ''[[Brahman]]'' everywhere, entering into ''Brahman'' etc. are all described as goals of yoga. Samkhya and yoga are conflated together and some verses describe them as being identical.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen9" /&gt; Mokshadharma also describes an early practice of elemental meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Wynne, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahabharata defines the purpose of yoga as the experience of uniting the individual ''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|ātman]]'' with the universal [[Brahman]] that pervades all things.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen9"&gt;Jacobsen, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Classical era (200 BCE – 500 CE) ===
This period witnessed many texts of Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism discussing and systematically compiling yoga methods and practices. Of these, Patanjali's Yoga Sutras are considered as a key work.

==== Classical yoga ====
During the period between the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan]] and the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] eras (c. 200 BCE–500 CE) philosophical schools of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] were taking form and a coherent philosophical system of yoga began to emerge.&lt;ref name="Larson, p. 36" /&gt;

Yoga as a philosophy is mentioned in Sanskrit texts dated to be completed between 200 BCE–200 CE. Kauṭilya's [[Arthashastra]] in verse 1.2.10, for example, states that there are three categories of ''anviksikis'' (philosophies) – [[Samkhya]] (nontheistic), Yoga (theistic) and [[Charvaka|Cārvāka]] (atheistic materialism).&lt;ref&gt;Original Sanskrit: साङ्ख्यं '''योगो''' लोकायतं च इत्यान्वीक्षिकी |&lt;br /&gt;English Translation: [https://archive.org/stream/Arthasastra_English_Translation/Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_-_English#page/n9/mode/2up Arthasastra Book 1, Chapter 2] Kautiliya, R Shamasastry (Translator), page 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olivelle, Patrick (2013), King, Governance, and Law in Ancient India: Kautilya's Arthasastra, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-989182-5}}, see Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Samkhya =====
{{further|Samkhya}}
&lt;!--[[File:KapilaMuni.jpg|thumb|[[Kapila]] Muni, in a Kolkata temple]]--&gt;

Many traditions in India began to adopt systematic methodology by about first century CE. Of these, [[Samkhya]] was probably one of the oldest philosophies to begin taking a systematic form.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Patanjali systematized Yoga, building them on the foundational metaphysics of Samkhya. In the early works, the Yoga principles appear together with the Samkhya ideas. Vyasa's commentary on the ''Yoga Sutras'', also called the ''Samkhyapravacanabhasya'' (''Commentary on the Exposition of the Sankhya Philosophy''), describes the relation between the two systems.&lt;ref&gt;Radhankrishnan, Indian Philosophy, London, George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd., 1971 edition, Volume II, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt; The two schools have some differences as well. Yoga accepted the conception of "personal god", while Samkhya developed as a rationalist, non-theistic/atheistic system of Hindu philosophy.&lt;ref name=lpfl /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mike Burley (2012), Classical Samkhya and Yoga – An Indian Metaphysics of Experience, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-64887-5}}, pages 31–46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For yoga acceptance of samkhya concepts, but with addition of a category for God, see: Radhakrishnan and Moore, p. 453.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes Patanjali's system is referred to as ''Seshvara Samkhya'' in contradistinction to Kapila's ''Nirivara Samkhya''.&lt;ref&gt;Radhankrishnan, Indian Philosophy, London, George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd., 1971 edition, Volume II, p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt;

The parallels between Yoga and Samkhya were so close that [[Max Müller]] says that "the two philosophies were in popular parlance distinguished from each other as Samkhya with and Samkhya without a Lord."&lt;ref&gt;Müller (1899), Chapter 7, "Yoga Philosophy," p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Yoga Sutras of Patanjali =====
{{Main|Raja Yoga|Yoga Sutras of Patanjali}}
[[File:Patanjali.jpg|thumb|Traditional Hindu depiction of Patanjali as an avatar of the divine serpent [[Shesha]].]]
{{Yoga Sutras of Patanjali}}
In Hindu philosophy, yoga is the name of one of the six ''[[astika|orthodox]]'' (which accept the testimony of Vedas) philosophical schools.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of the six orthodox schools, with detail on the grouping of schools, see: Radhakrishnan and Moore, "Contents," and pp. 453–487.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a brief overview of the yoga school of philosophy see: Chatterjee and Datta, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Karel Werner, author of ''Yoga And Indian Philosophy'', believes that the process of systematization of yoga which began in the middle and Yoga Upanishads culminated with the ''Yoga Sutras of Patanjali''.{{refn|Werner writes, "The word Yoga appears here for the first time in its fully technical meaning, namely as a systematic training, and it already received a more or less clear formulation in some other middle Upanishads....Further process of the systematization of Yoga as a path to the ultimate mystic goal is obvious in subsequent Yoga Upanishads and the culmination of this endeavour is represented by Patanjali's codification of this path into a system of the eightfold Yoga."&lt;ref&gt;Werner, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}

There are numerous parallels in the concepts in ancient Samkhya, Yoga and Abhidharma Buddhist schools of thought, particularly from 2nd century BCE to 1st century AD, notes Larson.&lt;ref name=l4345&gt;Larson, pp. 43–45&lt;/ref&gt; Patanjali's Yoga Sutras is a synthesis of these three traditions. From Samkhya, Yoga Sutras adopt the "reflective discernment" (''adhyavasaya'') of ''prakrti'' and ''purusa'' (dualism), its metaphysical rationalism, as well its three [[epistemology|epistemic]] methods to gaining reliable knowledge.&lt;ref name=l4345 /&gt; From Abhidharma Buddhism's idea of ''nirodhasamadhi'', suggests Larson, Yoga Sutras adopt the pursuit of altered state of awareness, but unlike Buddhist's concept of no self nor soul, Yoga is physicalist and realist like Samkhya in believing that each individual has a self and soul.&lt;ref name=l4345 /&gt; The third concept Yoga Sutras synthesize into its philosophy is the ancient [[Sannyasa|ascetic]] traditions of meditation and introspection, as well as the yoga ideas from middle Upanishads such as Katha, Shvetashvatara and Maitri.&lt;ref name=l4345 /&gt;

Patanjali's Yoga Sutras are widely regarded as the first compilation of the formal yoga philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;For [[Patanjali]] as the founder of the philosophical system called yoga see: Chatterjee and Datta, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The verses of ''Yoga Sutras'' are terse. Many later Indian scholars studied them and published their commentaries, such as the ''Vyasa Bhashya'' (c. 350–450 CE).&lt;ref&gt;Larson, p. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Patanjali's yoga is also referred to as Raja yoga.&lt;ref&gt;For "raja yoga" as a system for control of the mind and connection to Patanjali's ''Yoga Sutras'' as a key work, see: Flood (1996), pp. 96–98.&lt;/ref&gt; Patanjali defines the word "yoga" in his second sutra:

&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding:10px 15px; display:table;"&gt;'''{{lang|sa|योगश्‍चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः}}'''&lt;br /&gt;''({{IAST|yogaś citta-vṛtti-nirodhaḥ}})''&lt;br /&gt;- ''Yoga Sutras'' 1.2&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This terse definition hinges on the meaning of three Sanskrit terms. [[I. K. Taimni]] translates it as "Yoga is the inhibition (''{{IAST|nirodhaḥ}}'') of the modifications (''{{IAST|vṛtti}}'') of the mind (''{{IAST|citta}}'')".&lt;ref&gt;For text and word-by-word translation as "Yoga is the inhibition of the modifications of the mind." See: Taimni, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Swami Vivekananda]] translates the sutra as "Yoga is restraining the mind-stuff (''Citta'') from taking various forms (''Vrittis'')."&lt;ref&gt;Vivekanada, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edwin Bryant (author)|Edwin Bryant]] explains that, to Patanjali, "Yoga essentially consists of meditative practices culminating in attaining a state of consciousness free from all modes of active or discursive thought, and of eventually attaining a state where consciousness is unaware of any object external to itself, that is, is only aware of its own nature as consciousness unmixed with any other object."&lt;ref name=edbryant&gt;Edwin Bryant (2011, Rutgers University), [http://www.iep.utm.edu/yoga/ The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali] IEP&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryant 2009, p. 10"&gt;Bryant 2009, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryant 2009, p. 457"&gt;Bryant 2009, p. 457.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the meaning of yoga is understood as the practice of [[nirodha]] (mental control), then its goal is "the unqualified state of ''niruddha'' (the perfection of that process)",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Yoga Sytras of Patanjali, A Study Guide for Book I, Samadhi Pada; Translation and Commentary|last = Dass|first = Baba Hari|publisher = Sri Rama Publishing|year = 1999|isbn = 0-918100-20-8|location = Santa Cruz, Californnia|pages = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to [[Baba Hari Dass]]. In that context, "yoga (union) implies duality (as in joining of two things or principles); the result of yoga is the nondual state", and "as the union of the lower self and higher Self. The nondual state is characterized by the absence of individuality; it can be described as eternal peace, pure love, Self-realization, or liberation."&lt;ref&gt;Baba Hari Dass (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Patanjali's writing also became the basis for a system referred to as "Ashtanga Yoga" ("Eight-Limbed Yoga"). This eight-limbed concept is derived from the 29th Sutra of the Book 2 of Yoga Sutras. They are:

===== Yoga and Vedanta =====

Yoga and Vedanta are the two largest surviving schools of Hindu traditions. They share many thematic principles, concepts and belief in self/soul, but diverge in degree, style and some of their methods. Epistemologically, Yoga school accepts three means to reliable knowledge, while Advaita Vedanta accepts six ways.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Grimes, A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-3067-5}}, page 238&lt;/ref&gt; Yoga disputes the [[monism]] of Advaita Vedanta.&lt;ref name=shphillips /&gt; Yoga school believes that in the state of [[moksha]], each individual discovers the blissful, liberating sense of himself or herself as an independent identity; Advaita Vedanta, in contrast, believes that in the state of [[moksha]], each individual discovers the blissful, liberating sense of himself or herself as part of Oneness with everything, everyone and the Universal Self. They both hold that the free conscience is aloof yet transcendent, liberated and self-aware. Further, Advaita Vedanta school enjoins the use of Patanjali's yoga practices and the reading of Upanishads for those seeking the supreme good, ultimate freedom and [[Jivanmukta|jivanmukti]].&lt;ref name=shphillips&gt;{{cite book | first=Stephen H. | last=Phillips | title=Classical Indian Metaphysics: Refutations of Realism and the Emergence of "New Logic" | publisher=Open Court Publishing | year=1995 | pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Jainism ====

{{Main|Jainism}}
[[File:Parsva Shatrunjay.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Tirthankara [[Parsva]] in Yogic meditation in the [[Kayotsarga]] posture.]]

According to ''[[Tattvarthasutra]]'', 2nd century CE Jain text, yoga is the sum of all the activities of mind, speech and body.&lt;ref name="Tattvarthasutra 2007 p. 102" /&gt; [[Umasvati]] calls yoga the cause of "asrava" or [[Karma in Jainism|karmic influx]]&lt;ref name="Tattvarthasutra 6.2"&gt;Tattvarthasutra [6.2]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as one of the essentials—''[[Ratnatraya|samyak caritra]]''—in the path to liberation.&lt;ref name="Tattvarthasutra 6.2" /&gt; In his ''Niyamasara'', Acarya [[Kundakunda]], describes ''yoga bhakti''—devotion to the path to liberation—as the highest form of devotion.&lt;ref&gt;Niyamasara [134–40]&lt;/ref&gt; Acarya [[Haribhadra]] and Acarya [[Hemacandra]] mention the five major vows of ascetics and 12 minor vows of laity under yoga. This has led certain [[Indologist]]s like Prof. [[Robert J. Zydenbos]] to call Jainism, essentially, a system of yogic thinking that grew into a full-fledged religion.&lt;ref&gt;Zydenbos, Robert. "Jainism Today and Its Future." München: Manya Verlag, 2006. p.66&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yamas#Five yamas of Patañjali|five yamas]] or the constraints of the ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]'' bear a resemblance to the [[Mahavrata|five major vows of Jainism]], indicating a history of strong cross-fertilization between these traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Zydenbos (2006) p.66&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Worthington writes, "Yoga fully acknowledges its debt to Jainism, and Jainism reciprocates by making the practice of yoga part and parcel of life."&lt;ref&gt;Worthington, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}

Mainstream Hinduism's influence on Jain yoga can be see in [[Haribhadra]]'s ''[[Yogadṛṣṭisamuccaya]]'' which outlines an eightfold yoga influenced by Patanjali's eightfold yoga.&lt;ref&gt;P. 313 ''The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana: A Reconsideration of the Classical Yoga'' By Ian Whicher&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Yogacara school ====
{{Main|Yogacara}}
In the late phase of Indian antiquity, on the eve of the development of [[Classical Hinduism]], the
[[Yogacara]] movement arises during the [[Gupta period]] (4th to 5th centuries).
Yogacara received the name as it provided a "yoga," a framework for engaging in the practices that lead to the path of the [[bodhisattva]].&lt;ref&gt;Dan Lusthaus.

Alexander Simpkins, Annellen M. Simpkins. Published 2001. Tuttle Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8048-3199-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middle Ages (500–1500 CE) ===
Middle Ages saw the development of many satellite traditions of yoga. Hatha yoga emerged in this period.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, pp. 136–139.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bhakti movement ====
{{Main|Bhakti Yoga}}
The [[Bhakti movement]] was a development in medieval Hinduism which advocated the concept of a [[personal God]] (or "[[Svayam Bhagavan|Supreme Personality of Godhead]]"). The movement was initiated by the [[Alvars]] of South India in the 6th to 9th centuries, and it started gaining influence throughout India by the 12th to 15th centuries.&lt;ref name="Cutler"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cutler|first=Norman|title=Songs of Experience|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1987|page=1|isbn=978-0-253-35334-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=veSItWingx8C&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaiva and [[Vaishnava]] bhakti traditions integrated aspects of ''Yoga Sutras'', such as the practical meditative exercises, with devotion.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' elucidates the practice of a form of yoga called ''viraha'' (separation) ''bhakti''. ''Viraha bhakti'' emphasizes one pointed concentration on Krishna.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsen, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tantra ====
Tantra is a genre of yoga that arose in India no later than the 5th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Einoo |first=Shingo (ed.) |year=2009 |page=45 |title=Genesis and Development of Tantrism |publisher=University of Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|The earliest documented use of the word "Tantra" is in the [[Rigveda]] (X.71.9).&lt;ref name=Banerjee&gt;Banerjee, S.C., 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; The context of use suggests the word ''tantra'' in Rigveda means "technique".}} George Samuel states, "Tantra" is a contested term, but may be considered as a school whose practices appeared in mostly complete form in Buddhist and Hindu texts by about 10th century CE.{{sfn|Samuel|2008|p=9}}  Over its history, some ideas of Tantra school influenced the [[Hindu]], [[Bon]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], and [[Jainism|Jain]] traditions. Elements of Tantric yoga rituals were adopted by and influenced state functions in medieval Buddhist and Hindu kingdoms in [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]].{{sfn|White|2000|p=7}}{{sfn|Samuel|2008|pp=324–333}}

By the turn of the first millennium, [[hatha yoga]] emerged from [[tantra]].&lt;ref name="khecari1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated16" /&gt;

===== Vajrayana or Tibetan Buddhism =====
{{Main|Vajrayana}}
[[Vajrayana]] is also known as '''Tantric Buddhism''' and ''Tantrayāna''. Its texts were compiled starting with 7th century and Tibetan translations were completed in 8th century CE. These tantra yoga texts were the main source of Buddhist knowledge that was imported into Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;John Powers (2004), in Encyclopedia of Buddhism (Editors: Damien Keown et al.), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-31414-5}}, pages 775–785&lt;/ref&gt; They were later translated into Chinese and other Asian languages, helping spread ideas of Tantric Buddhism. The Buddhist text [[Hevajra Tantra]] and ''Caryāgiti'' introduced hierarchies of chakras.&lt;ref name="autogenerated14"&gt;White, David Gordon. ''Yoga in Practice''. Princeton University Press 2012, page 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Yoga is a significant practice in Tantric Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Lama Yeshe 1998, pg.135–141"&gt;Lama Yeshe (1998). ''The Bliss of Inner Fire.''

in Pundarīka's eleventh-century Vimalaprabhā commentary on the Kālacakratantra, hathayoga is said to bring about the "unchanging moment" (aksaraksana) "through the practice of nāda by forcefully making the breath enter the central channel and through restraining the bindu of the bodhicitta in the vajra of the lotus of wisdom". While the means employed are not specified, the ends, in particular restraining bindu, semen, and making the breath enter the central channel, are similar to those mentioned in the earliest
descriptions of the practices of hathayoga, to which I now turn."&lt;/ref&gt; Hatha yoga synthesizes elements of Patanjali's ''Yoga Sutras'' with posture and breathing exercises.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;  It marks the development of asanas (plural) into the full body 'postures' now in popular usage&lt;ref name="Burley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burley|first=Mikel|title=Hatha Yoga: Its Context, Theory and Practice|year=2000|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|location=Delhi|isbn=978-8120817067|page=16|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ezxQHzjwUosC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=mikel+burley#v=onepage&amp;q=mikel%20burley&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, along with its many modern variations, is the style that many people associate with the word ''yoga'' today.&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, Georg.

=== Reception in the West ===
{{see|Yoga as exercise}}
[[File:Ustrasana - Camel Pose.jpg|thumb|right|The Ustrasana, also known as the camel pose, is one of several yoga asana (pose).]]

Yoga came to the attention of an educated western public in the mid-19th century along with other topics of Indian philosophy. In the context of this budding interest, [[N. C. Paul]] published his ''Treatise on Yoga Philosophy'' in 1851.

The first Hindu teacher to actively advocate and disseminate aspects of yoga to a western audience, [[Swami Vivekananda]], toured Europe and the United States in the 1890s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Shaw, Eric. "35 Moments", ''[[Yoga Journal]]'', 2010-09.&lt;/ref&gt; The reception which Swami Vivekananda received built on the active interest of intellectuals, in particular the [[Transcendental Club|New England Transcendentalists]], among them [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] (1803–1882), who drew on [[German Romanticism]] and the interest of philosophers and scholars like [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]] (1770–1831), the brothers [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]] (1767–1845) and [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel]] (1772–1829), [[Max Müller|Max Mueller]] (1823–1900), [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] (1788–1860), and others who had (to varying degrees) interests in things Indian.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Philip, American Veda.

''Die Philosophie der Inder''. Stuttgart, 1974: A. Kroener Verlag, pp. 166f.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theosophists]] also had a large influence on the American public's view of Yoga.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utne.com/2007-03-01/Mind-Body/Fear-of-Yoga.aspx?page=2#axzz2bnQLbp2o |title=Fear of Yoga |publisher=Utne.com |accessdate=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Esoteric views current at the end of the 19th century provided a further basis for the reception of Vedanta and of Yoga with its theory and practice of correspondence between the spiritual and the physical.&lt;ref&gt;De Michelis, Elizabeth, A History Of Modern Yoga. Patanjali and Modern Esotericism. London, 2004: Continuum Books, pp. 19ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The reception of Yoga and of Vedanta thus entwined with each other and with the (mostly [[Neoplatonism]]-based) currents of religious and philosophical reform and [[Spiritual transformation|transformation]] throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. [[Mircea Eliade|M.

The American born yogi by the name of [[Pierre Bernard (yogi)|Pierre Arnold Bernard]], after his travels through the lands of Kashmir and Bengal, founded the Tantrik Order of America in 1905.

Author: Elizabeth De Michelis. Published: Continuum, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect of Yoga was adopted as a cultural trend in Europe and North America starting in the first half of the 20th century.

[[File:Project Yoga Richmond 1.jpg|thumb|right|A group of people practicing yoga in 2012.]]
Since 2001, the popularity of yoga in the USA has expanded. The number of people who practiced some form of yoga has grown from 4 million (in 2001) to 20 million (in 2011). It has drawn support from world leaders such as [[Barack Obama]] who stated, "Yoga has become a universal language of spiritual exercise in the United States, crossing many lines of religion and cultures,... Every day, millions of people practice yoga to improve their health and overall well-being. That's why we're encouraging everyone to take part in PALA (Presidential Active Lifestyle Award), so show your support for yoga and answer the challenge".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/07/01/weekly-highlights-july-1-2011 Weekly Highlights, July 1, 2011], The White House, United States, JULY 1, 2011 (MIYA SAIKA CHEN)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American College of Sports Medicine]] supports the integration of yoga into the exercise regimens of healthy individuals as long as properly-trained professionals deliver instruction. The College cites yoga's promotion of "profound mental, physical and spiritual awareness" and its benefits as a form of stretching, and as an enhancer of breath control and of core strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diversify Your Client's Workout With Yoga|url= http://certification.acsm.org/blog/2013/february/diversify-your-clients-workouts-with-yoga |publisher=American College of Sports Medicine|accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health effects ==
{{Main|Yoga as exercise}}

Yoga has been studied and may be recommended to promote relaxation, reduce stress and improve some medical conditions such as [[premenstrual syndrome]].&lt;ref name=duplerfrey/&gt; Yoga is considered to be a low-impact activity that can provide the same benefits as "any well-designed exercise program, increasing general health and stamina, reducing stress, and improving those conditions brought about by sedentary lifestyles". It is particularly promoted as a [[physical therapy]] routine, and as a regimen to strengthen and balance all parts of the body.&lt;ref name=duplerfrey&gt;Dupler, Douglas; Frey, Rebecca (2006) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/yoga.aspx#1 Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine], 3rd ed, {{ISBN|978-0787618681}}; Retrieved 30 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yoga may improve psychological health during cancer treatment, although more evidence is needed to confirm this possible benefit.&lt;ref name="kellysmithetcmed"/&gt; Other research indicated that yoga could be useful in addition to other treatments in [[schizophrenia]],&lt;ref name="Schizophrenia"/&gt; and may have positive effects on [[mental health]], although the quality of research to define these effects is low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Front Psychiatry|year=2013|volume=3|page=117 |doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2012.00117 |title=Yoga on our minds: a systematic review of yoga for neuropsychiatric disorders|authors=Balasubramaniam M, Telles S, Doraiswamy PM|pmid=23355825|pmc=3555015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the [[Department of Health (Australia)|Australian Government's Department of Health]] published the results of a review of alternative therapies that sought to determine if any were suitable for being covered by [[health insurance]].

While some of the medical community regards the results of yoga research as significant, others point to many flaws which undermine results.

Among the main reasons that experts cite for causing negative effects from yoga are beginners' competitiveness and instructors' lack of qualification.&lt;ref name="NTYM01512" /&gt; As the demand for yoga classes grows, many people get certified to become yoga instructors, often with relatively little training. Not every newly certified instructor can evaluate the condition of every new trainee in their class and recommend refraining from doing certain poses or using appropriate props to avoid injuries.&lt;ref name="NTYM01512" /&gt; In turn, a beginning yoga student can overestimate the abilities of their body and strive to do advanced poses before their body is flexible or strong enough to perform them.&lt;ref name="NTYM01512" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DM82912" /&gt;

[[Vertebral artery dissection]], a tear in the arteries in the neck which provide blood to the brain can result from rotation of the neck while the neck is extended.

It is claimed that yoga can be an excellent training for children and adolescents, both as a form of physical exercise and for breathing, focus, mindfulness, and stress relief: many school districts have considered incorporating yoga into their Physical Education programs. The Encinitas, California school district gained a San Diego Superior Court Judge's approval to use yoga in Physical Education, holding against the parents who claimed the practice was intrinsically religious and hence should not be part of a state funded program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jdjournal.com/2013/07/02/california-judge-says-yoga-is-secular-approves-its-use-in-schools/|title=California Judge Says Yoga is Secular, Approves its Use in Schools|author=Daniel June|date=2 July 2013|work=JD Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Christian meditation|A Christian reflection on the New Age|Aspects of Christian meditation}}
Some Christians integrate yoga and other aspects of Eastern spirituality with prayer and meditation.

On the contrary, one can take from them what is useful so long as the Christian conception of prayer, its logic and requirements are never obscured. It is within the context of all of this that these bits and pieces should be taken up and expressed anew."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webdiocesi.chiesacattolica.it/cci_new/documenti_diocesi/80/2013-01/23-236/AdA-201301-Opera-Completa.pdf Argomenti di Attualità mons.

In 1989 and 2003, the [[Holy Office|Vatican]] issued two documents: ''[[Aspects of Christian meditation]]'' and "[[A Christian reflection on the New Age]]," that were mostly critical of eastern and New Age practices. The 2003 document was published as a 90-page handbook detailing the Vatican's position.&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of vocational psychology'' by W. Bruce Walsh, Mark Savickas 2005 {{ISBN|0-8058-4517-8}} page 358&lt;/ref&gt; The Vatican warned that concentration on the physical aspects of meditation "can degenerate into a cult of the body" and that equating bodily states with mysticism "could also lead to psychic disturbance and, at times, to moral deviations." Such has been compared to the early days of Christianity, when the church opposed the gnostics' belief that salvation came not through faith but through a mystical inner knowledge.&lt;ref name="nytimes_vatican" /&gt; The letter also says, "one can see if and how [prayer] might be enriched by meditation methods developed in other religions and cultures"&lt;ref name="Letter_from_Vatican"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/curia/cdfmed.htm |title=1989 Letter from Vatican to Bishops on Some Aspects of Christian Meditation |publisher=Ewtn.com |accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but maintains the idea that "there must be some fit between the nature of [other approaches to] prayer and Christian beliefs about ultimate reality."&lt;ref name="nytimes_vatican" /&gt; Some{{Which|date=January 2018}} [[Fundamental Christianity|fundamentalist]] Christian organizations consider yoga to be incompatible with their religious background, considering it a part of the [[New Age movement]] inconsistent with Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Ankerberg, John &amp; Dr Weldon, John, ''Encyclopedia of New Age Beliefs'', Harvest House Publishers, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Another view holds that Christian meditation can lead to religious pluralism. This is held by an interdenominational association of Christians that practice it. "The ritual simultaneously operates as an anchor that maintains, enhances, and promotes denominational activity and a sail that allows institutional boundaries to be crossed." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = An Anchor and a Sail: Christian Meditation as the Mechanism for a Pluralist Religious Identity | journal = Sociology of Religion | year = 2009 | first = Jonathan | last = Mermis–Cava }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 11th century, the Persian scholar [[Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī|Al Biruni]] visited India, lived with Hindus for 16 years, and with their help translated several significant Sanskrit works into Arabic and Persian languages.

In Iran, as of May 2014, according to its Yoga Association, there were approximately 200 yoga centres in the country, a quarter of them in the capital [[Tehran]], where groups can often be seen practising in parks. This has been met by opposition among conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21602272-conservative-clerics-are-wary-popular-pastime-perils-yoga|title=The perils of yoga: Conservative clerics are wary of a popular pastime|work=Economist.com.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009, Turkey's head of the [[Presidency of Religious Affairs|Directorate of Religious Affairs]], [[Ali Bardakoğlu]], discounted personal development techniques such as [[reiki]] and yoga as commercial ventures that could lead to extremism.
