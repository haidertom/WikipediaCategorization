The '''Asset Description Metadata Schema''' ('''ADMS''') is a common [[metadata]] vocabulary to describe standards, so-called interoperability assets, on the Web.

Used in concert with [[Web Syndication|web syndication technology]] ADMS helps people make sense of the complex multi-publisher environment around standards and in particular the ones which are semantic assets such as [[ontologies]], [[data model]]s, [[Data dictionary|data dictionaries]], code lists, [[XML]] and [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] schemas. In spite of their importance, standards are not easily discoverable on the web via search engines because [[metadata]] about them is seldom available. Navigating on the websites of the different publishers of standards is not efficient either.

==Key terminology==
A '''semantic asset''' is a specific type of standard which involves:

 highly reusable metadata
 (e.g. xml schemata, generic data models)
 and/or reference data
 (e.g. code lists, taxonomies, dictionaries, vocabularies)

Organisations use semantic assets to share information and knowledge (within themselves and with others). Semantic assets are usually very valuable and reusable elements for the development of Information Systems, in particular, as part of machine-to-machine interfaces. As enablers to interoperable information exchange, semantic assets are usually created, published and maintained by standardisation bodies. Nonetheless, ICT projects and groups of experts also create such assets. There are therefore many publishers of semantic assets with different degrees of formalism.

==What is ADMS==
ADMS&lt;ref name="ADMS"&gt;[http://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/adms/home], ADMS homepage on Joinup&lt;/ref&gt; is a standardised metadata vocabulary created by the [[European Union|EU]]'s Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administrations (ISA) Programme&lt;ref name="ISA"&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/isa/], Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administrations (ISA) Programme&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[European Commission]] to help publishers of standards document what their standards are about (their name, their status, theme, version, etc.) and where they can be found on the Web. ADMS descriptions can then be published on different websites while the standard itself remains on the website of its publisher (i.e. syndication of content). ADMS embraces the multi-publisher environment and, at the same time, it provides the means for the creation of aggregated catalogues of standards and single points of access to them based on ADMS descriptions. The Commission will offer a single point of access to standards described using ADMS via its collaborative platform, Joinup.&lt;ref name="Joinup"&gt;[https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/], Link to Joinup&lt;/ref&gt; The Federation&lt;ref name="Federation"&gt;[https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/elibrary/document/adms-enabled-federation-semantic-asset-repositories-brochure], Link to the brochure of the Federation of Semantic Asset Repositories&lt;/ref&gt; service will increase the visibility of standards described with ADMS on the web. This will also stimulate their reuse by Pan-European initiatives.

==ADMS Working Group==
More than 43 people of 20 EU Member States as well as from the US and Australia have participated in the [https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/adms/document/adms-working-group ADMS Working Group]. Most of them were experts from standardisation bodies, research centres and the EU Commission. The working group used a methodology based on [[W3C]]’s processes and methods.&lt;ref name="CoreVocsPM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/D3.1-Process%20and%20Methodology%20for%20Core%20Vocabularies_v1.01.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430164940/https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/D3.1-Process%20and%20Methodology%20for%20Core%20Vocabularies_v1.01.pdf |archivedate=2013-04-30 |df= }}, Link to ISA's Core Vocs methodology&lt;/ref&gt;

==How to download ADMS==
ADMS version 1 was officially released in April 2012.&lt;ref name="ADMSrelease"&gt;[https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/news/adms-v100-officially-released], ADMS V1 release announcement&lt;/ref&gt; Version 1.00 of ADMS is available for download on Joinup:&lt;ref name="Joinup"/&gt;
https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/adms/release/100&lt;ref name="ADMS1"&gt;[https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/], Link to ADMS v1&lt;/ref&gt;

ADMS is offered under ISA's Open Metadata Licence v1.1&lt;ref name="OpenMetadataLicense"&gt;[https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/category/licence/isa-open-metadata-licence-v11], ISA Open Metadata Licence v1.1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related work==
The ADMS specification reuses existing [[metadata]] vocabularies and core vocabularies including:
* The [[Dublin Core]] Metadata Element Set (DCMES)&lt;ref&gt;http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Data Catalog Vocabulary]] (DCAT) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[FOAF (software)|Friend of a Friend (FOAF) Ontology]]
* The [[vCard]] Ontology &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/vcard-rdf/], Representing vCard Objects in RDF&lt;/ref&gt;

==The future of ADMS==
ADMS v1.00 will be contributed to&lt;ref name="ADMScontributed"&gt;[https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/adms/topic/adms-public-review-key-specifications-interoperability-developed-eus-isa-programme-], Announcement that key specifications for interoperability developed by the EU's ISA Programme will become W3C standards&lt;/ref&gt; W3C’s Government Linked Data (GLD) Working Group.&lt;ref name="W3C_GLD"&gt;[http://www.w3.org/2011/gld/wiki/Main_Page], W3 Government Linked Data (GLD) Working Group&lt;/ref&gt; This means that ADMS will be published by the GLD Working Group as First Public Working Drafts for further consultation within the context of the typical W3C standardization process. The desired outcome of that process will be the publication of ADMS as a W3C Recommendation available under W3C's Royalty-Free License.

The ADMS RDFS Vocabulary already has a w3.org namespace: [http://www.w3.org/ns/adms http://www.w3.org/ns/adms#].

The '''Center for Media, Data and Society (CMDS)''' is a research center at [[Central European University]] (CEU) that focuses on media, communication and information policy. Located in Budapest, Hungary, CMDS produces scholarly and practice-oriented research about journalism, media freedom, and internet policy.  

== History and Network ==

The Center was founded over a decade ago as the Center for Media and Communication Studies.  It began in 2004, and was designed to serve as a focal point an international network of acclaimed scholars and academic institutions, whose research ranges from media and communications policy, fundamental communications rights through media and civil society and new media and digital technology to media in transition. In September 2014 it was relaunched as the Center for Media, Data and Society &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Name change| url=http://cmds.ceu.hu/article/2014-10-06/center-adopts-new-name}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to represent new interests in technology policy, and big data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission of CMDS |url=http://cmds.ceu.hu/mission}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center has been led since September 2016 by Marius Dragomir, a media expert, journalist and scholar&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cmds.ceu.edu/article/2016-07-01/marius-dragomir-appointed-director-center-media-data-and-society|title=Marius Dragomir Appointed Director of the Center for Media, Data and Society {{!}} CMDS|website=cmds.ceu.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Projects and Mission==
The Center’s research projects focus on identifying trends and challenges in the use of information technologies and advancing policy discussions about the regulation of data and media. The Center has an annual summer school on activism and digital media that draws democracy advocates, media activists, and civil rights campaigners from around the world to discuss policy and strategy.

[[Image:Collaborative E-democracy2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|In a collaborative e-democracy every citizen participates in the policy process, either indirectly, by delegating proxy representatives to vote on their behalf within the different policy domains, or directly, by voting on a particular issue (green arrows).]]

'''Collaborative e-democracy''' or '''super-democracy''' is a democratic conception that combines key features of [[direct democracy]], [[representative democracy]], and [[e-democracy]] (i.e. the use of [[Information and communication technology|ICTs]] for democratic processes). The concept was first published at two international academic conferences in 2009 (see below).

Collaborative e-democracy refers to a [[political system]] in which governmental stakeholders ([[politicians]]/[[political party|parties]], [[Minister (government)|ministers]], [[Member of Parliament|parliamentarians]] etc.) and non-governmental stakeholders ([[NGO]]s, [[lobbying|political lobbies]], local communities, individual [[citizens]], etc.) collaborate on the development of public [[law]]s and [[policy|policies]]. This collaborative policymaking process is conducted on a governmental [[social networking site]] in which all citizens are members (collaborative e-policy-making).

While directly elected [[government officials]] (i.e. [[Liquid democracy#Delegated voting|‘proxy representatives’]]) would conduct the vast majority of law and policy-making processes (representative democracy), the citizens would retain their final [[voting]] power on each issue (direct democracy). Additionally each citizen would be empowered to propose their own policies to the electorate and thus initiate new policy processes where applicable ([[initiative]]). Collaboratively generated policies would consider the opinion of a larger proportion of the citizenry; therefore they may be more just, more sustainable, and thus easier to implement.

==Theoretical background==
Collaborative e-democracy involves following theory components:
* '''‘Collaborative democracy’''', a “political framework where electors and the elected actively collaborate to attain the best possible solution to any situation using collaborative enabling technologies to facilitate wide scale citizen participation in government”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collaborative-democracy.com/cdDefinition.cfm www.collaborative-democracy.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csus.edu/ccp/cdn/ Collaborative Democracy Network], Center for Collaborative Policy, [[California State University, Sacramento]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''‘Collaborative e-policymaking’''' (or CPM) is a software facilitated five phase [[Policy#Policy cycle|policy process]] in which every citizen participates directly or indirectly (i.e. via proxy representatives). The process is conducted on a governmental social networking site in which all citizens are members. Each citizen can suggest issues, rank and evaluate the suggestions of others, and vote on the laws and policies that will affect them. [At a general level, CPM is a universal process that would facilitate every organisation (e.g. business, government) or self-selected group (e.g. union, online community) to co-create their own regulations (e.g. laws, code of conduct) and strategies (e.g. government actions, business strategies) by involving all stakeholders in the corresponding decision-processes.] &lt;ref&gt;Petrik, K. (2010) [http://www.jedem.org/article/viewArticle/14 "Deliberation and Collaboration in the Policy Process: A Web 2.0 approach. ], JeDEM - eJournal of eDemocracy and Open Government, Vol 2, No 1 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csus.edu/ccp/ Collaborative Policy], Center for Collaborative Policy, [[California State University, Sacramento]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Australian National University, ANU E Press; [http://epress.anu.edu.au/anzsog/collab_gov/mobile_devices/index.html Collaborative Governance - A new era of public policy in Australia?]
&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Proxy voting]] and [[delegative democracy]]''': Direct democracy would require each citizen to vote on each policy issue each time. As this would overburden most people, the citizens in a collaborative e-democracy delegate trusted representatives (or proxies) to vote on their behalf on all those issues and/or domains where they lack of time, experience, or interest for direct participation. Although the proxy votes on the principals behalf, the principal retains the final voting power on each issue. Thus proxy representation combines the best features of direct democracy and representative democracy on the social networking site.&lt;ref&gt;Petrik, K. (2010) [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1556176.1556222 "Participation and e-Democracy: How to utilize Web 2.0 for policy decision-making."], [http://www.dgrc.org/ Digital Government Society of North America]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy process==
Collaborative e-policymaking is a process where public laws &amp; policies are generated in collaboration of multiple stakeholders (e.g. affected people; [[domain expert]]s; parties who can help to implement a solution). Each new policy cycle starts with the identification of a collective problem or goal by the collective of participants (i.e. citizens, experts, proxy representatives).

* '''Suggestion &amp; ranking phase''': Each participant is encouraged to submit policy proposals for how to solve the identified problem / achieve the goal (policy [[crowdsourcing]]). The submissions are ranked so that the policy with the most supporters appears on top of the others.
* '''Evaluation phase''': For each top-ranked proposal (i.e. law or government action) the upsides and downsides of its implementation are defined so that the collective can evaluate how they would be affected by each policy. The evaluation process is supported by independent domain experts.
* '''Voting phase''': Based on the co-created information the collective votes for the proposal that is considered to be optimal for solving the collective problem / achieving the goal. As a result, a new law is introduced or a new government action executed.
* '''Revision phase''': A pre-determined period after implementation the collective is addressed to determine whether the problem was solved / the goal achieved by the selected policy or not. If yes, the policy cycle concludes; if no, the process starts over with the suggestion phase until the issue is resolved.
To be clear, CPM is automated as a [[Process (computing)|software process]] that is conducted on the governmental social networking site.

==Principles==
Collaborative e-democracy is based on following core principles:
* '''[[Self-government]]''', the ideal of direct democracy, and “''quod omnes tangit ab omnibus approbetur''”, the ancient maxim from the Roman law that says “''that which affects all people must be approved by all people''”. This principle is in sharp contrast to representative democracy where the public policymaking process is biased by corporate lobbies ([[Corporatocracy]]).
* '''[[Open source governance]]''', a political philosophy which advocates the application of the philosophies of the [[open source]] and [[open content]] movements to democratic principles in order to enable any interested citizen to add to the creation of policy.
* '''Aggregation''': One function of the social networking site is to aggregate the citizens’ opinions on issues (e.g. agreement with a certain policy). Based on this communality people can form ad-hoc groups to address these issues.
* '''[[Collaboration]]''': Another function facilitates the collaboration of likeminded people on common issues (e.g. the co-creation of a policy proposal) within aggregated groups and/or between independent groups. Besides groups with controversial strategies / perspectives which focus on similar outcomes compete with each other.
* '''[[Collective intelligence]]''': The CPM process harnesses the peoples’ collective intelligence, i.e. a shared group intelligence that emerges from the aggregation, collaboration, competition and (consensus) decision-making of the various stakeholders. This group intelligence is utilised to identify issues and to co-create solutions that are optimal / sustainable for most people. Collective intelligence reflects a design pattern of [[Web 2.0]].
* '''Collective learning &amp; Adoption''': The direct democracy component of collaborative e-democracy shifts the responsibility of policymaking from government teams (top down) to the collective of citizens (bottom up). As the people are confronted with the consequences of their own decisions a collective learning process is initiated. Collaborative e-democracy is not a static construct but flexible and open to change, by quickly integrating learning experiences and by collectively adopting to new social, economical or environmental circumstances. This principle reflects ‘Perpetual Beta’, another design pattern of Web 2.0.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oreilly.com/catalog/web2report/chapter/web20_report_excerpt.pdf O’Reilly Radar Web 2.0 Principles and Best Practices]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits &amp; limitations==
The concept of collaborative e-democracy intends to achieve following '''benefits''':
* '''[[Transparency (social)|Transparency]] and accessibility''': The CPM process would be transparent and accessible for all citizens via the internet.
* '''[[Political efficacy]]''': Allowing citizens to participate in government processes would increase the political efficacy and counteract the [[democratic deficit]].
* '''[[Deliberative democracy|Deliberation]]''': The governmental social networking site as main platform for political information &amp; communication would increase the quality of deliberation between the various governmental and non-governmental stakeholders of the nation.
* '''Collective awareness''': Large scale online participation would increase the public awareness of the collective problems, goals, or policy issues (e.g. the opinions of minorities) and facilitate harnessing the nation’s collective intelligence for collaboratively developing policies.

On the contrary the concept has several '''limitations''':
* '''[[Constitution]]al limits''': Most democratic nations have constitutional limits to direct democracy; governments may be unwilling to relinquish such policy-making authority to the collective.
* '''[[Digital divide]]''': People without internet access would be disadvantaged in a collaborative e-democracy. Therefore, traditional democratic procedures would be made available until the digital divide is concluded.
* '''[[Majority rule]]''': Such as in most democratic decision processes majorities could over vote minorities. The evaluation process would however give a fair warning when a minority group would be significantly discriminated against by a certain policy.
* '''[[Naive]]ty''':  Voters may lack a thorough understanding of the facts and data surrounding their options.  This could lead to misplaced votes which do not represent the voters' actual will.  However, the proxy voting / delegation included in the system greatly mitigates this problem.  Increased education, [[critical thinking]] and reasoning skills (all of which could occur naturally through a better form of government), and usage of the internet should also help reduce the problem. Also, the CPM process involves proxies and experts to inform people upon the implications of the suggested policies before a decision is made.

==Research &amp; development==
In 2009 the two conceptions, ''collaborative e-democracy'' and ''collaborative e-policy-making'', were  first published at two [[academic conference]]s on [[e-governance]] and [[e-democracy]]:
* Petrik, Klaus (2009) ''“Participation and e-Democracy: How to utilize Web 2.0 for policy decision-making”''; the [http://dgo2009.pbworks.com/ 10th International Digital Government Research Conference: "Social Networks: Making Connections between Citizens, Data &amp; Government"] in [[Puebla]], [[Mexico]];
* Petrik, Klaus (2009) ''“Deliberation and Collaboration in the Policy Process: A Web 2.0 approach”'';  [http://edem2009.ocg.at/ The 3rd Conference on Electronic Democracy] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].
* A third publication appears in the [http://www.jedem.org/article/viewArticle/14 "eJournal of eDemocracy and Open Government", Vol 2, No 1 (2010)].

Current research is conducted at the [[Queensland University of Technology]] in [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]] where a [[Prototype#Computer programming.2Fcomputer science|prototype]] software for  collaborative e-policymaking is being developed. The software will be featured on an independent web 2.0 platform with open participation; the volunteer participants will be facilitated to collaboratively develop Australian public laws and policies by proceeding through the phases of the CPM process. The start of the trialling period is probably 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urbaninformatics.net/people/klaus/ QUT Urban Informatics Lab]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Differential technological development''' is a strategy proposed by [[transhumanist]] philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] in which societies would seek to influence the sequence in which [[emerging technologies]] developed. On this approach, societies would strive to retard the development of harmful technologies and their applications, while accelerating the development of beneficial technologies, especially those that offer protection against the harmful ones.{{which|date=October 2016}}&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2002"&gt;{{cite journal

[[Paul Christiano]] believes that while accelerating technological progress appears to be one of the best ways to improve human welfare in the next few decades, a faster rate of growth cannot be equally important for the far future because growth must eventually saturate due to physical limits. Hence, from the perspective of the far future, differential technological development appears more crucial.&lt;ref name=Christiano2014&gt;{{cite web|last1=Christiano|first1=Paul|title=On Progress and Prosperity|url=http://effective-altruism.com/ea/9f/on_progress_and_prosperity/|website=Effective Altruism Forum|accessdate=21 October 2014|date=15 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable?|blog post on forum|date=July 2016}}

Inspired by Bostrom's proposal, [[Luke Muehlhauser]] and Anna Salamon suggested a more general project of "differential intellectual progress", in which society advances its wisdom, philosophical sophistication, and understanding of risks faster than its technological power.&lt;ref name=Muehlhauser2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muehlhauser|first=Luke|author2=Anna Salamon|title=Intelligence Explosion: Evidence and Import|date=2012|pages=18–19|url=http://intelligence.org/files/IE-EI.pdf|accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable?|self-published paper|date=July 2016}}&lt;ref name=Muehlhauser2013&gt;{{cite book|last=Muehlhauser|first=Luke|title=Facing the Intelligence Explosion|date=2013|publisher=Machine Intelligence Research Institute|url=http://intelligenceexplosion.com/2012/ai-the-problem-with-solutions/|accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable?|self-published paper|date=July 2016}} Brian Tomasik has expanded on this notion.&lt;ref name=Tomasik2013&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tomasik|first1=Brian|title=Differential Intellectual Progress as a Positive-Sum Project|url=http://foundational-research.org/differential-intellectual-progress-as-a-positive-sum-project/|website=Foundational Research Institute|accessdate=18 February 2016|date=23 Oct 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable?|self-published paper|date=July 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7597">With regard to a [[mobile network operator]] (MNO, or ''operator''), the term dumb pipe, or '''dumb network''', refers to a simple network that, with a high enough bandwidth to transfer bytes between the customer's device and the [[Internet]] without the need to prioritize content, can afford to be completely neutral with regard to the services and applications the customer accesses. The use of the term "dumb" refers to the fact that the network operator does not affect the customer's accessibility of the Internet such as by either limiting the available services or applications to its own proprietary portal (like a [[Closed platform|walled garden]]) or offer additional capabilities and services beyond simple connectivity (like a [[smart pipe]], the term with which it contrasts). A dumb pipe primarily provides simple bandwidth and network speeds greater than the maximum network loads expected thus avoiding the need to discriminate between data types.

Among the commonly understood operational models for a [[mobile network operator|MNO]] are the dumb pipe, the [[smart pipe]], and the [[Closed platform|walled garden]].

==Description==

A dumb network is marked by using intelligent devices (i.e. PCs) at the periphery that make use of a network that does not interfere with or manage an application's operation / communication. The dumb network concept is the natural outcome of the [[end to end principle]]. The [[Internet]] was originally designed to operate as a dumb network.

In some circles the dumb network is regarded as a natural culmination of technological progress in network technology. With the justification that the dumb network uniquely satisfies the requirements of the end to end principle for application creation, supporters see the dumb network as uniquely qualified for this purpose, as – by design – it is not sensitive to the needs of applications. The dumb network model can, in some ways, allow for flexibility and ease of innovation in the development of applications that is not matched by other models.

=== Examples ===
One widely regarded example of the operator "dumb pipe" scenario is [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] [[iPhone]]. The [[iPhone]] enables its users to directly surf the [[Internet]] with its mobile [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] [[web browser|browser]] and connects to [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] [[iTunes Store]] for purchasing [[ringtone]]s and [[Mobile music|music]] instead of the operator's own portal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.engadget.com/2007/09/05/apple-adds-iphone-ringtones-to-itunes/ Apple adds iPhone ringtones to iTunes]&lt;/ref&gt; Operators such as [[AT&amp;T Mobility]] cannot offer their traditional services (such as downloads of [[mobile wallpaper|wallpapers]], [[ringtones]], [[mobile game|games]], [[mobile software|applications]], etc.) as [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] controls the total [[iPhone]] user experience. Operators must be content to provide only the network connectivity and bandwidth which the [[iPhone]] has tripled in some cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shaiberger.com/?p=52 iPhone Triples AT&amp;amp;T's Data Traffic]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to losing valuable revenue opportunities with the customer, operators are rumored to pay [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] a percentage of the customer's monthly bill as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.ft.com/techblog/2007/08/apples-european.html Apple's European iPhone Deals]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2704,2185225,00.asp Inside Apple: An iPhone Invasion]&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[iPhone]] is a good example of the dumb pipe, not everyone believes it will ultimately be bad for operators.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/gadgets/wireless/magazine/16-02/ff_iphone?currentPage=all Wired: How the iPhone Blew Up the Wireless Industry]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of the operator dumb pipe / [[smart pipe]] dilemma is the upcoming deployment of [[WiMAX]] technology. Companies such as [[Sprint Nextel]] and [[Clearwire]] are looking into ways to deploy [[WiMAX]] with additional services to keep them from becoming dumb pipes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiercebroadbandwireless.com/story/analysys-wimax-carriers-risk-becoming-dumb-pipes/2007-07-16 WiMAX Carriers Risk Becoming Dumb Pipes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719131129/http://www.fiercebroadbandwireless.com/story/analysys-wimax-carriers-risk-becoming-dumb-pipes/2007-07-16 |date=2008-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinions==

=== Criticism ===

Critics of dumb network architecture posit two arguments in favor of "intelligent" networks. The first, that certain users and transmission needs of certain applications are more important than others and thus should be granted greater network priority or [[quality of service]]. An example is that of real time video applications that are more time sensitive than say, text applications. Thus video transmissions would receive network priority to prevent picture skips, while text transmissions could be delayed without significantly affecting its application performance. The second is that networks should be able to defend against attacks by [[malware]] and other [[Brad Pitt|bad actors]].

The dumb network (and the end to end principle) was conceived of as an antithesis to the idea of a centralized [[intelligent computer network]] in which all applications were under central network control. A synthesis is taking place in the [[context aware network]]s. These networks allow intelligent devices to set up end-to-end applications as in the dumb network. However, they are aware of application needs and in the social and enterprise context in which the applications are being used. Thus the network can make decisions on resource allocation conflicts in light of the collective needs of all users and the purposes (social and enterprise) that guide them.

=== Support ===

Advocates of dumb networks  counter the first argument by pointing out that prioritizing network traffic is very expensive in monetary, technology, and network performance. Dumb networks advocates also consider the real purpose for prioritizing network traffic is to overcome insufficient bandwidth to handle traffic and not a network protocol issue.  The security argument is that malware is an end-to-end problem and thus should be dealt with at the endpoints, and that attempting to adapt the network to counterattacks is both cumbersome and inefficient.

The '''electronic personal dosimeter''' ('''EPD''') is an electronic device that has a number of sophisticated functions, such as continual monitoring which allows alarm warnings at preset levels and live readout of dose accumulated. These are especially useful in high dose areas where residence time of the wearer is limited due to dose constraints. The dosimeter can be reset, usually after taking a reading for record purposes, and thereby re-used multiple times.

==PIN Dosimeter==

[[PIN diode]]s are used to quantify the radiation dose for military and personnel applications.

==MOSFET dosimeters==

[[MOSFET]] dosimeters &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mosfet.ca/global/pdf/technotes/te_4.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410104912/http://www.mosfet.ca/global/pdf/technotes/te_4.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; are now used as clinical dosimeters for radiotherapy radiation beams. The main advantages of MOSFET devices are:

1. The MOSFET dosimeter is direct reading with a very thin active area (less than 2 μm).

2. The physical size of the MOSFET when packaged is less than 4&amp;nbsp;mm.

3. The post radiation signal is permanently stored and is dose rate independent.

[[Gate oxide]] of [[MOSFET]] which is conventionally [[silicon dioxide]] is an active sensing material in MOSFET dosimeters. Radiation creates defects (acts like electron-hole pairs) in oxide, which in turn affects the [[threshold voltage]] of the MOSFET. This change in [[threshold voltage]] is proportional to radiation dose. Alternate high-k gate dielectrics like [[Hafnium oxide]], [[Hafnium dioxide]]&lt;ref&gt;V. S. Senthil Srinivasan and Arun Pandya, ″Dosimetry aspects of hafnium oxide metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) capacitor″, [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040609011013976] Thin Solid Films
Volume 520, Issue 1, 31 October 2011, Pages 574–577&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aluminum oxide]]s are also proposed as a radiation dosimeters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10111">'''Eugene Podkletnov''' ({{lang-ru|Евгений Подклетнов}}, Yevgeny Podkletnov) is a [[Rossiyane|Russian]] [[Ceramic engineering|ceramics engineer]] known for his claims made in the 1990s of designing and demonstrating [[gravity shielding]] devices consisting of rotating discs constructed from [[High-temperature superconductivity|ceramic superconducting]] materials.

==Background and education==
Podkletnov  graduated from the [[Mendeleev Russian University of Chemistry and Technology|University of Chemical Technology, Mendeleyev Institute]], in [[Moscow]]; he then spent 15 years at the Institute for High Temperatures in the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. He received a doctorate in materials science from [[Tampere University of Technology]] in [[Finland]]. After graduation he continued [[superconductor]] research at the university, in the [[Materials science|Materials Science]] department, until his expulsion in 1997. After which he moved back to Moscow where it is reported that he took an engineering job. Since leaving Tampere in 1997 Podkletnov has avoided public contact or appearances.&lt;ref name=Platt1998 /&gt; There is a report that he later returned to Tampere to work on superconductors at Tamglass Engineering Oy.&lt;ref name="Painovoimaa" /&gt;

==Gravity shielding==
According to the account Podkletnov gave to [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] reporter [[Charles Platt (author)|Charles Platt]] in a 1996 phone interview, during a 1992 experiment with a rotating superconducting disc:
 
:"Someone in the laboratory was smoking a pipe, and the pipe smoke rose in a column above the superconducting disc. So we placed a ball-shaped magnet above the disc, attached to a balance. The balance behaved strangely. We substituted a nonmagnetic material, silicon, and still the balance was very strange. We found that any object above the disc lost some of its weight, and we found that if we rotated the disc, the effect was increased."&lt;ref name=Platt1998&gt;{{cite news|last=Platt|first=Charles|title=Breaking the Law of Gravity|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.03/antigravity_pr.html|accessdate=2011-06-19|newspaper=Wired|date=June 3, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public controversy===
Podkletnov's first peer-reviewed paper on the apparent gravity-modification effect, published in 1992, attracted little notice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Podkletnov|first1=E|last2=Nieminen|first2=R |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/092145349290055H |title=A possibility of gravitational force shielding by bulk YBa2Cu3O7−x superconductor|journal=[[Physica C]] |volume=203|issue=3–4|date=December 10, 1992|pages=441–444|accessdate=April 29, 2014|bibcode = 1992PhyC..203..441P |doi = 10.1016/0921-4534(92)90055-H }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, he submitted a longer paper, in which he claimed to have observed a larger effect (2% weight reduction as opposed to 0.3% in the 1992 paper) to the ''[[Journal of Physics D]]''.&lt;ref name="withdrawn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="withdrawn2"&gt;{{cite arxiv|first=Evgeny|last=Podkletnov|eprint=cond-mat/9701074|title=Weak gravitation shielding properties of composite bulk Y Ba2Cu3O7−x superconductor below 70 K under e.m. field|date=September 16, 1997}} This is believed to be substantially the same paper accepted for publication in 1996 by Journal of Physics D which was later withdrawn by the author.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Platt, a member of the editorial staff, Ian Sample, leaked the submitted paper to Robert Matthews, the science correspondent for the British newspaper, the ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]''.&lt;ref name=Platt1998 /&gt;

On September 1, 1996, Matthews's story broke, leading with the startling statement: "Scientists in Finland are about to reveal details of the world's first antigravity device."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1996/09/01/ngrav01.html |title=Scientists in Finland are about to reveal details of the world's first antigravity device |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |first=Graeme |last=Archer |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050314023910/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=%2Farchive%2F1996%2F09%2F01%2Fngrav01.html |archivedate=March 14, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing furor, the director of the laboratory where Podkletnov was working issued a defensive statement that Podkletnov was working entirely on his own. Vuorinen, listed as the paper's coauthor, disavowed prior knowledge of the paper and claimed that the name was used without consent. Podkletnov himself complained that he had never claimed to block gravity, only to have reduced its effect.&lt;ref name=Platt1998 /&gt;

Podkletnov withdrew his second paper after it had been initially accepted.&lt;ref name="withdrawn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bp0.blogger.com/_X2tcLFEJnwU/RavF9AEHkZI/AAAAAAAAAAM/ZQ7DaXG1P04/s1600-h/podkletnov.jpg |first1=E.E.|last1=Podkletnov |first2=P.T.|last2=Vuorinen|title=Gravitation shielding properties of composite bulk Y Ba2Cu3O7−x superconductor below 70 K under electromatic field|date=May 13, 1996|publisher=Journal of Applied Physics D|accessdate=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="withdrawn2" /&gt; The resulting furor over the alleged claims in the withdrawn paper is reported to be the primary reason for his expulsion from his lab and the termination of his employment at the university.&lt;ref name=Platt1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Painovoimaa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ylioppilaslehti.fi/1998/04/24/painovoimaa-kumoamassa/ylioppilaslehti.fi/1998/04/24/painovoimaa-kumoamassa/ |title=Painovoimaa kumoamassa|author=Vuotta Sitten|date=April 24, 1998|language=Finnish|accessdate=April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attempted verification===
In a 1997 telephone interview with Charles Platt, Podkletnov insisted that his gravity-shielding work was reproduced by researchers at universities in [[Toronto]] and [[Sheffield]], but none have come forward to acknowledge this. The Sheffield work is known to have only been intended as partial replication, aimed at observing any unusual effects which might be present, since the team involved lacked the necessary facilities to construct a large enough disc and the ability to duplicate the means by which the original disc was rotated. Podkletnov counters that the researchers in question have kept quiet "lest they be criticized by the mainstream [[scientific community]]".&lt;ref name=Platt1998/&gt; Podkletnov is reported to have visited the Sheffield team in 2000 and advised them on the conditions necessary to achieve his effect, conditions that they never achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdf.aiaa.org/preview/2001/PV2001_3363.pdf|title=Gravity Modification by High Temperature Superconductors|authors=Woods, Cooke, Helm &amp; Caldwell|publisher=[[AIAA]]|year=2001}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a BBC news item, it was alleged that researchers at [[Boeing]] were funding a project called GRASP (Gravity Research for Advanced Space Propulsion) which would attempt to construct a gravity shielding device based on rotating superconductors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2157975.stm | work=[[BBC News]] | title=Boeing tries to defy gravity | date=July 7, 2002| accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a subsequent ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' news item stated that Boeing had denied funding GRASP with company money, although Boeing acknowledged that it could not comment on "black projects".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/research/1282281.html?page=3| title=Science Does The Impossible: February 2003 Cover Story| publisher=[[Popular Mechanics]]| year=2003| accessdate=April 29, 2014| deadurl=bot: unknown| archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070930015205/http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/research/1282281.html?page=3| archivedate=September 30, 2007| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is alleged that the GRASP proposal was presented to Boeing and Boeing chose not to fund it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelivingmoon.com/41pegasus/02documents/Project_Grasp.html|title=Gravity Shielding Still Science Fiction, Boeing Says|date=July 31, 2002|work=Space.com|first=Jim|last=Banke|accessdate=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gravity beam==
Also during the 1997 telephone interview with Platt, Podkletnov said that he was continuing to work on gravitation, claiming that with new collaborators at an unnamed "chemical research center" in Moscow he has built a new device.  He said:

:"Normally there are two spheres, and a spark jumps between them. Now imagine the spheres are flat surfaces, superconductors, one of them a coil or O-ring. Under specific conditions, applying resonating fields and composite superconducting coatings, we can organize the energy discharge in such a way that it goes through the center of the electrode, accompanied by gravitation phenomena - reflecting gravitational waves that spread through the walls and hit objects on the floors below, knocking them over...The second generation of flying machines will reflect gravity waves and will be small, light, and fast, like UFOs. I have achieved impulse reflection; now the task is to make it work continuously."&lt;ref name=Platt1998 /&gt;

'''FOSS Movement in India''' refers to the campaign across the country during the 1990s and 2000s in particular, to promote Free and Open Source Software. It was marked by the existence of many [[Indian Linux User Groups]] (ILUGs) groups and [[Free Software User Groups]] (FSUGs) in different cities, town and other areas.

The prominent members of the campaign include the late [[Atul Chitnis]], Prof [[Nagarjuna G.]] and others.

==Timeline of the campaign==
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Date !! Event
|-
| 1990s || Computer magazines like [[PC-Quest]] boost interest in [[FOSS]] (or [[Linux]]) by regularly writing articles, and sharing software on CDs and DVDs from this field. Among the early writers are the late [[Atul Chitnis]]. 
|-
| 1993-94 || The [[not-for-profit]]/[[NGO]] [[Centre for Education and Documentation]], based at Bombay (now Mumbai) and Bangalore (now Bengaluru) promotes the use of [[FOSS]] (or [[Linux]], as it was then widely called) among the non-profit and alternate journalist community, through installing it on their computers, in its rather early shape. CED also used some [[FOSS]] tools while granting early access to non-profits to their email systems at ILBOM and ILBAN (IndiaLink) service.

'''Factum Arte''' is a company based in [[Madrid]], [[Milan]], and [[London]] that seeks to construct a bridge between new technologies and craft skills in the conservation of [[cultural heritage]] and in [[contemporary art]].&lt;ref&gt;Simon Schaffer, "What does Digitality do to the Arts?", in "the Miracle of Cana: The Originality of the Reproduction", Cini Foundation and Cierre Edizioni, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; By using various forms of high-definition [[3D scanners]], Factum Arte has been able to record, in digital form using non-contact equipment, a number of endangered sites/objects of cultural importance.&lt;ref name="factum-arte.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factum-arte.com/ind/2/Conservation |title=Conservation |publisher=Factum Arte |date= |accessdate=2016-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done in conjunction with the [[Factum Foundation for Digital Technology in Conservation]], which seeks to promote the use of non-contact 3D scanners to record museum collections and historic monuments, especially in areas where they are at risk.&lt;ref&gt;Factum Foundation for Digital Technology in Conservation, http://www.factumfoundation.org/pag/198/The-Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to recording objects, Factum Arte is able to use the digital data to create an exact [[facsimile]] of the object on a scale of 1:1.&lt;ref&gt;Factum Arte, [http://www.factum-arte.com/aboutus], ‘factum-arte.com’&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Factum Arte completed the installation of an exact facsimile of the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]] in the [[Valley of the Kings]] in [[Luxor]], near [[Howard Carter]]’s house. The facsimile, and its proximity to the original tomb, is intended to provoke a debate about preservation;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/2613b3e2-c5df-11e3-a7d4-00144feabdc0.html | title=Fit for a king: Tutankhamun’s replica burial chamber | publisher=The Financial Times Ltd. | date=17 April 2014 | accessdate=19 July 2016 | author=Aspden, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-2616973/Replica-Tutankhamun-tomb-opens-public-bid-slow-irreversible-damage-original.html | title=Replica Tutankhamun tomb opens in bid to slow down irreversible damage to the original caused by tourists' BREATH | publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd. | date=30 April 2014 | accessdate=19 July 2016 | author=Travelmail Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.campbellsci.co.uk/king-tut-tomb-monitoring | title=Egypt: Preserving King Tut's Tomb Campbell datalogger controls monitoring of conditions at Tutankhamen site | publisher=Campbell Scientific United Kingdom | accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as Factum Arte’s Director, Adam Lowe, was said: "The tomb of Tutankhamun was built to last for eternity, but it wasn’t built to be visited".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.inside3dp.com/creating-exact-replica-pharaoh-tutankhamuns-tomb-3d-printing/ | title=Creating an exact replica of Pharaoh Tutankhamun’s Tomb with 3D printing | publisher=Inside3DP.com | date=19 October 2014 | accessdate=19 July 2016 | author=Daveys, Janey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, Factum Arte has worked with institutions such as the [[British Museum]] in London, the [[Musée du Louvre]] in Paris, the [[Pergamon Museum]] in Berlin, the [[Museo del Prado]] in Madrid, and the [[Supreme Council of Antiquities]] in Egypt. In addition to its work in the field of cultural heritage, Factum Arte also assists a wide range of contemporary artist in creating technically difficult and innovative works of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.factum-arte.com/aboutus | title=What is Factum Arte? | publisher=Factum Arte | accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Factum Arte was founded in 2001 by the artists [[Adam Lowe]], [[Manuel Franquelo]], with [[Fernando Garcia-Guereta]] to facilitate the recording of the Tomb of [[Seti I]] and works with a number of artists including [[Marc Quinn]] and [[Anish Kapoor]].&lt;ref&gt;Factum-arte.com/art&lt;/ref&gt; The Seti project involved the design and construction of 3D laser scanners, software, and photographic equipment to record the walls of the tomb at high-resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theartsdesk.com/we-made-it/we-made-it-factum-arte | title=We Made It: Factum Arte Recreating a facsimile of Tutankhamun’s tomb and a painting by Veronese is all part of revolutionising our experience of art | publisher=The Arts Desk Ltd. | date=19 December 2014 | accessdate=19 July 2016 | author=Hallet, Florence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Historical Projects==

===Tomb of Seti I===
Factum Arte was founded in 2001 in order to facilitate the development of technology needed specifically for the recording of the Tomb of Seti I.

Seti’s tomb is regarded by many as the most visually impressive, and historically important tomb in the Valley of the Kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travelinstyle.com/egypt-tours/tomb-mighty-pharaoh-seti/ |title=Tomb of the Mighty Pharaoh Seti I |publisher=Nubian Nile Cruises, Inc. |accessdate=19 July 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730182803/http://travelinstyle.com/egypt-tours/tomb-mighty-pharaoh-seti/ |archivedate=30 July 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Discovered by [[Giovanni Battista Belzoni]] in October 1817, the tomb of Pharaoh Seti I is the longest and one of the most decorated tombs in the Valley of the Kings. Despite being in excellent condition on its discovery, the tomb is currently closed to visitors to the Valley due to its deteriorating condition over the years. In addition to the removal of wall panels, and the loss of paint due to 19th century plaster casts, the tomb has suffered from collapses and cracks due to expeditions searching for hidden chambers in the 1950s and 60s that caused changes in the moisture levels of the surrounding rock.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Romer (Egyptologist)|Romer, John]]; Romer, Elizabeth, 1993, "The Rape of Tutankhamun", Michael Mara Books Limited&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tomb of [[Thutmose III]]===
Factum Arte was commissioned by United Exhibits Group to make a 1:1 facsimile of the Tomb of [[Thutmose III]] in 2002. The facsimile was toured at exhibitions in various museums in the United States between November 2002 and December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.factum-arte.com/pag/31/Facsimile-of-the-Tomb-of-Thutmose-III | title=Facsimile of the Tomb of Thutmose III | publisher=Factum Arte | accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 a second facsimile of the tomb was exhibited in Madrid, Edinburgh, and Basel titled Immortal Pharaoh: The Tomb of Thutmose III (Edinburgh) and The Tomb of Thutmose III: The Dark Hours of the Sun (Madrid and Basel).&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Leicht, "Reise Durch den Verborgenen Raum", https://www.bibelwerk.de/sixcms/media.php/169/WUB_406_Auf%20den%20Spuren%20Jesu%201_Rep.pdf, bibelwerk.de, April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tomb of Thutmose III is the oldest complete version of the narrative of the Egyptian [[Amduat]], the journey the Sun God takes through the hours of the night.

===Tomb of Tutankhamun===
The facsimile of the tomb was installed briefly outside the [[Conrad Hotel]] in Cairo for the EU-Egypt Business and Tourism Summit and was unveiled by [[Catherine Ashton]] the European [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs]] in November 2012 as a gift to the people of Egypt, coinciding with the 90th anniversary of the tomb’s discovery.&lt;ref&gt;EU-Egypt Taskforce – Co-chairs Conclusions, http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/EN/foraff/133511.pdf, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Catherine Ashton Unveils Replica Tomb of Tutankhamun at Start of EU-Egypt Taskforce", http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/EN/foraff/133448.pdf, European Union, 13 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21565918-technology-service-history-toot-toot-king-tut?fsrc=scn/gp/wl/pe/kingtutstomb | title=Toot toot, King Tut Technology in the service of history | publisher=The Economist Newspaper Limited | accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2014 Factum Arte installed the facsimile in the Valley of the Kings, beside Howard Carter’s house, the consultant of the construction site where the facsimile was installed was "[http://www.walycenter.org/ Tarek Waly center architecture and heritage]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.factum-arte.com/pag/789/The-Theban-Necropolis-Preservation-Initiative|title=Factum Arte :: The Theban Necropolis Preservation Initiative|last=S.L.|first=Factum Arte,|website=www.factum-arte.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.walycenter.org/en/heritage-planning/10-heritage-planning/211-facsimile-of-tutankhamuns-tomb|title=Facsimile of Tutankhamun's Tomb {{!}} Tarek Waly Center|last=Administrator|website=www.walycenter.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was unveiled by the Minister of Antiquities [[Mohamed Ibrahim Moustafa|Mohamed Ibrahim]], the Minister for Tourism [[Hisham Zazou]], the Governor of [[Luxor]] [[Tarek Saad el Din]] and EU Ambassador [[James Moran (diplomat)|James Moran]]. The aim of the facsimile is to inform visitors to the valley about the importance of preservation and to promote awareness about the degrading state of the tombs since their opening to tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pastpreservers.com/official-opening-of-the-facsimile-of-king-tutankhamuns-tomb/ | title=Official Opening of the Facsimile of King Tutankhamun’s Tomb | publisher=Past Preservers/Aegaeus | accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/archaeology/egypt-unveils-exact-replica-of-tutankhamuns-tomb-made-with-a-3d-printer-9307882.html | title=Egypt Unveils Exact Replica of Tutankhamun's Tomb Made with a 3D Printer | publisher=Independent | date=30 April 2014 | accessdate=19 July 2016 | author=Burrell, Ian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, Egyptologist [[Nicholas Reeves]] published a paper in which he hypothesised the presence of the tomb of [[Nefertiti]] as being behind one of the walls of Tutankhamun's tomb. Reeves' based his theory on markings he observed on the wall in the data recorded by Factum Arte.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y2CFJ1DAQg, 3 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015, Egyptian newspaper ''[[Al-Ahram|Ahram]]'' reported that initial examinations had confirmed the existence of the wall markings observed by Reeves in Factum Arte's data.&lt;ref name="english.ahram.org.eg"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContentP/9/147582/Heritage/Anticipation-grows-at-possibility-of-Tutankhamun-t.aspx | title=Anticipation Grows at Possibility of Tutankhamun Tomb's Hidden Chambers | publisher=Ahram Online | accessdate=19 July 2016 | author=El-Aref, Nevine}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same article reported that the results of further examinations would be published on 4 November 2015; the same day that the tomb was discovered in 1922.&lt;ref name="english.ahram.org.eg"/&gt;

===Throne Room of [[Ashurnasirpal II]]===
In 2004, during the [[Iraq War|Second Gulf War]], Factum Arte and Danish company [[United Exhibits Group]] (UEG) embarked on a project to record, and create a facsimile of the throne room of [[Ashurnasirpal II]] in the ancient city of [[Nimrud]]. Fragments of the throne room exist in the collections of various museums in Europe and the United States. Factum Arte was given permission to record these fragments in the British Museum, the Pergamon in Berlin, Dresden, Harvard, and Princeton.&lt;ref&gt;Factum-Arte.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, at the time, Iraq was considered too dangerous to send a team out to record the remaining fragments in Nimrud. In 2015 the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] militants in Northern Iraq destroyed much of the remaining artwork in the ruins of the palace of Nimrud. While recording these fragments in 2005 would not have prevented their destruction by ISIS, it would have kept avenues open to further in-depth study through the high-resolution 3D data, and presented the possibility of reuniting the fragments in the form of facsimile.

===The Wedding Feast at Cana===
In November 2007, Factum Arte’s facsimile of ''[[The Wedding at Cana|The Wedding Feast at Cana]]'' (1563), by [[Paolo Veronese]], was presented by the [[Cini Foundation]] in the original location of the painting, the [[Andrea Palladio]]'s refectory for the Monastery of San Giorgio Maggiore, [[Venice]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/b851d86c-f4c3-11e2-a62e-00144feabdc0.html | title=Conservation: Factum Arte Remaking History | publisher=The Financial Times Ltd. | date=26 July 2013 | accessdate=19 July 2016 | author=Jobey, Liz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original painting, commissioned in 1562, was plndered by the [[French Revolutionary Army]] of Napoleon in 1797 and sent to the Louvre Museum, where it hangs opposite the [[Mona Lisa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/wedding-feast-cana | title=The Wedding Feast at Cana | publisher=The Louvre | accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The facsimile was commissioned in 2006 by the Fondazione Giorgio Cini and, following an agreement with the Louvre, Factum Arte’s technicians were allowed to scan the painting at night. ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' called the facsimile a "turning point in art".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===[[Giovanni Battista Piranesi|Piranesi]]===
In 2010 the Cini Foundation commissioned the visualisation and manufacture of objects designed by the 18th century artist and antiquarian [[Giambattista Piranesi]]. The project was conceived by Adam Lowe, [[Michele de Lucchi]], and [[John Wilton-Ely]] and was exhibited in the Cini Foundation on the island of San Giorgio Maggiore for the [[Venice Biannale]]. The objects were later toured for exhibitions in Madrid, Barcelona, and San Diego&lt;ref&gt;Mariano Navarro, "Piranesi Contemporáneo", www.elcultural.es, 4 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Chute, "Seeing History Through Piranesi’s Eyes", San Diego Union-Tribune, 26 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In March–May 2014, Factum Arte exhibited the series at the [[Sir John Soane's Museum|Sir John Soane Museum]] in London. Diverse Manieri: Piranesi, Fantasy and Excess aimed to explore the relationship between [[Sir John Soane]] and Piranesi. The objects were shown in the context of prints, drawings and books in Soane’s library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/mar/06/giovanni-piranesi-fantasy-and-excess-review | title=Piranesi, Fantasy and Excess Review: Where Imagination and Reality Collide | publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited | date=6 March 2014 | accessdate=19 July 2016 | author=Jones, Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sir John Soane Museum, {{cite web|url=http://www.soane.org/u/press/Press_Release_Diverse_Maniere_Sir_John_Soanes_Museum.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915124118/http://www.soane.org/u/press/Press_Release_Diverse_Maniere_Sir_John_Soanes_Museum.pdf |archivedate=15 September 2015 |df=dmy }} "Diverse Manieri Press Release", December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The objects were visualised in digital form from Piranesi’s designs and then rematerialized in three dimensions in the materials specified in the design. The manufacture of the objects involved a variety of methods including [[stereo-lithography]], [[Milling (machining)|milling]], [[fused deposition modelling]], [[electro forming]] and [[electro plating]], in addition to a host of moulding and casting technologies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.factum-arte.com/pag/598/Diverse-Maniere--Piranesi--Fantasy-and-Excess | title=Diverse Maniere: Piranesi, Fantasy and Excess | publisher=Gobierno de España  Factum Arte | accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn25233-how-3d-printers-forge-new-art-from-old-etchings.html#.VVxK-ql5bq | title=How 3D Printers Forge New Art From Old Etchings | publisher=Reed Business Information Ltd. | date=17 March 2014 | accessdate=19 July 2016 | author=Ings, Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Lowe, "Messing About with Masterpieces: New Work by Giambattista Piranesi (1720-1778)", http://www.factum-arte.com/lib/kcfinder/upload/files/articles/30.pdf, original article in Art in Print, May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polittico Griffoni===
The 16 panels of the [[Polittico Griffoni]] once formed the altarpiece of the [[Basilica of San Petronio]] in Bologna. It was considered one of the greatest altarpieces of the 15th Century Bolognese School. The panels were originally painted by [[Francesco del Cossa]] and [[Ercole De Roberti]]. The panels, removed in 1725, are now scattered in various museums in Italy, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, the Netherlands, and the Vatican City.&lt;ref name="factum-arte1"&gt;Fabio Isman, "Il Polittico Griffoni da Bologna al Mundo", http://www.factum-arte.com/lib/kcfinder/upload/files/articles/BellItalia_marzo_2014.pdf, original article in Bell’ Italia, March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the Lucida 3D scanner, designed by Manuel Franquelo, Factum Arte and the Factum Foundation for Digital Technology in Conservation collaborated with San Petronio Basilica to record, reproduce and reunite the panels as a facsimile in their original location.&lt;ref name="factum-arte1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.factum-arte.com/pag/637/Polittico-Griffoni%3C/ref%3E | title=Polittico Griffoni Digital Technology Applied to the Re-unification of a Scattered Altarpiece | publisher=Factum Arte | accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
Factum Arte has developed a number technologies in order to better facilitate the recording and production of objects.

===Examples===
*Lucida 3D Laser Scanner – Built and tested by Factum Arte’s cofounder and artist Manuel Franquelo, the Lucida system is capable of scanning surface relief, without contact, and with a depth of field of 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm at resolution of 100 microns.&lt;ref&gt;Josephine Livingstone, "Mapping the Newest Old Map of the World", theawl.com, The AWL, 17 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The scanner is designed to be portable, and easy to set up and operate; with the aim to make the recording of objects and sites more feasible and accessible for both individuals and institutions.
*Cement Printer – the cement printer, designed by engineer Dwight Perry, aims to print a 3 dimensional concrete structure directly from [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] files. A prototype was displayed at the GENESIS exhibition, about genetics, at the [[Centraal Museum]] in Utrecht in 2007. In 2009 the artist Anish Kapoor utilized a second prototype of the printer as an investigation into new ways of developing form. Kapoor used the results of his experimentation as a piece, entitled "Greyman Cries, Shaman Dies, Billowing Smoke, Beauty Evoked", in his solo exhibition at the [[Royal Academy]] in London. Kapoor’s vision and process was detailed in a book ''Unconformity and Entropy'', published by Turner Books in 2010 - {{ISBN|978-8475068916}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.amazon.ca/Anish-Kapoor-Unconformity-Simon-Schaffer/dp/847506891X | title=Unconformity and Entropy | publisher=Turner Books | date=31 March 2010 | accessdate=18 July 2016 | author=Kapoor, Anish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cement printer is currently undergoing development at Factum Arte’s workshop in Madrid.

==Criticism==
In 2013, when referring to the facsimile of the Tomb of Tutankhamun and the facsimile of the caves at [[Lascaux]], historian Tom Holland voiced criticism of the idea of creating "fakes" as a means to protect the originals:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In our society, there is a huge premium set on authenticity. Clearly, were there not a difference between the copy and the original, it wouldn’t matter – you could make a replica and trash the original. Tutankhamun and Lascaux were created by people who believed in the world of the spirits, the dead, and the supernatural. You don’t have to believe in a god or gods to feel a place is consecrated and has a particular quality that cannot be reproduced.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Gee, "Which would you rather visit – a fake tomb or a real one?", https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24478909, BBC World Service&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Camera obscura2.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Camera obscura]], from a manuscript of military designs.  Seventeenth century, possibly Italian.]]
The '''history of the camera''' can be traced much further back than the introduction of [[photography]].   Cameras evolved from the [[camera obscura]], and continued to change through many generations of photographic technology, including [[daguerreotype]]s, [[calotype]]s, [[dry plate]]s, [[photographic film|film]], and to the modern day with [[digital camera]]s.

==Camera obscura==
[[File:Camera Obscura box18thCentury.jpg|thumb|right|An artist using an 18th-century camera obscura to trace an image]]
The forerunner to the photographic camera was the ''[[camera obscura]]''. Camera obscura ([[Latin]] for "dark room") is the natural optical phenomenon that occurs when an image of a scene at the other side of a screen (or for instance a wall) is projected through a small hole in that screen and forms an inverted image (left to right and upside down) on a surface opposite to the opening. The oldest known record of this principle is a description by [[History of Science and Technology in China|Han Chinese]] philosopher [[Mozi]] (ca. 470 to ca. 391 BC). Mozi correctly asserted that the camera obscura image is inverted because [[light]] travels in straight lines from its source. In the 11th century Arab physicist [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen)'s wrote very influential books about optics, including experiments with light through a small opening in a darkened room.

The use of a lens in the opening of a wall or closed window shutter of a darkened room to project images used as a drawing aid has been traced back to circa 1550. Since the late 17th century portable camera obscura devices in tents and boxes were used as a drawing aid.
{{further|Camera obscura}}

Before the invention of photographic processes there was no way to preserve the images produced by these cameras apart from manually tracing them. The earliest cameras were room-sized, with space for one or more people inside; these gradually evolved into more and more compact models. By Niépce's time portable box camerae obscurae suitable for photography were readily available. The first camera that was small and portable enough to be practical for photography was envisioned by [[Johann Zahn]] in 1685, though it would be almost 150 years before such an application was possible.

==Early fixed images==

The first partially successful [[photograph]] of a camera image was made in approximately 1816 by [[Nicéphore Niépce]],&lt;ref name=newhall13&gt;{{cite book

using a very small camera of his own making and a piece of paper coated with [[silver chloride]], which darkened where it was exposed to light. No means of removing the remaining unaffected silver chloride was known to Niépce, so the photograph was not permanent, eventually becoming entirely darkened by the overall exposure to light necessary for viewing it. In the mid-1820s, Niépce used a sliding wooden box camera made by Parisian opticians Charles and Vincent Chevalier to experiment with photography on surfaces thinly coated with [[Bitumen of Judea]].&lt;ref name="Davenport1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Davenport|first=Alma|title=The history of photography: an overview|year=1999|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque, NM|isbn=0-8263-2076-7|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bitumen slowly hardened in the brightest areas of the image. The unhardened bitumen was then dissolved away. [[View from the Window at Le Gras|One of those photographs]] has survived.

==Daguerreotypes and calotypes==
After Niépce's death in 1833, his partner [[Louis Daguerre]] continued to experiment and by 1837 had created the first practical photographic process, which he named the [[daguerreotype]] and publicly unveiled in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;Kosinski Dorothy, The Artist and the Camera, Degas to Picasso. New Haven: Yale University Press,1999. p.25&lt;/ref&gt; Daguerre treated a silver-plated sheet of copper with [[iodine|iodine vapor]] to give it a coating of light-sensitive [[silver iodide]]. After exposure in the camera, the image was [[photographic processing|developed]] by mercury vapor and fixed with a strong solution of ordinary salt (sodium chloride). [[Henry Fox Talbot]] perfected a different process, the [[calotype]], in 1840. As commercialized, both processes used very simple cameras consisting of two nested boxes. The rear box had a removable ground glass screen and could slide in and out to adjust the focus. After focusing, the ground glass was replaced with a light-tight holder containing the sensitized plate or paper and the lens was capped. Then the photographer opened the front cover of the holder, uncapped the lens, and counted off as many minutes as the lighting conditions seemed to require before replacing the cap and closing the holder. Despite this mechanical simplicity, high-quality [[achromatic lens]]es were standard.&lt;ref name=wade&gt;{{cite book | last=Wade | first=John | title=A Short History of the Camera | year=1979 | publisher=Fountain Press | location=Watford | isbn=0-85242-640-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Studijskifotoaparat.JPG|thumb|left|Late 19th century studio camera]]

==Dry plates==
[[Collodion process|Collodion dry plates]] had been available since 1857, thanks to the work of [[Désiré van Monckhoven]], but it was not until the invention of the [[gelatin]] dry plate in 1871 by Richard Leach Maddox that the wet plate process could be rivaled in quality and speed. The 1878 discovery that heat-ripening a gelatin emulsion greatly increased its sensitivity finally made so-called "instantaneous" snapshot exposures practical. For the first time, a tripod or other support was no longer an absolute necessity. With daylight and a fast plate or film, a small camera could be hand-held while taking the picture. The ranks of amateur photographers swelled and informal "candid" portraits became popular. There was a proliferation of camera designs, from single- and twin-lens reflexes to large and bulky field cameras, simple [[box camera]]s, and even "detective cameras" disguised as pocket watches, hats, or other objects.

The short exposure times that made candid photography possible also necessitated another innovation, the mechanical [[shutter (photography)|shutter]]. The very first shutters were separate accessories, though built-in shutters were common by the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=wade/&gt;{{clear left}}

==Kodak and the birth of film==

[[File:Brownie2 overview3.jpg|thumb|right|Kodak No. 2 Brownie box camera, circa 1910]]

The use of [[photographic film]] was pioneered by [[George Eastman]], who started manufacturing paper film in 1885 before switching to [[celluloid]] in 1888-1889. His first camera, which he called the "[[Kodak]]," was first offered for sale in 1888. It was a very simple [[box camera]] with a fixed-focus lens and single shutter speed, which along with its relatively low price appealed to the average consumer. The Kodak came pre-loaded with enough film for 100 exposures and needed to be sent back to the factory for processing and reloading when the roll was finished. By the end of the 19th century Eastman had expanded his lineup to several models including both box and folding cameras.

In 1900, Eastman took mass-market photography one step further with the [[Brownie (camera)|Brownie]], a simple and very inexpensive box camera that introduced the concept of the [[snapshot (photography)|snapshot]]. The Brownie was extremely popular and various models remained on sale until the 1960s.

Film also allowed the [[movie camera]] to develop from an expensive toy to a practical commercial tool.

Despite the advances in low-cost photography made possible by Eastman, plate cameras still offered higher-quality prints and remained popular well into the 20th century. To compete with rollfilm cameras, which offered a larger number of exposures per loading, many inexpensive plate cameras from this era were equipped with magazines to hold several plates at once. Special backs for plate cameras allowing them to use film packs or rollfilm were also available, as were backs that enabled rollfilm cameras to use plates.

Except for a few special types such as [[Schmidt camera]]s, most professional [[astrograph]]s continued to use plates until the end of the 20th century when electronic photography replaced them.

==35 mm==

[[File:Argus C3.jpg|thumb|right|Argus C3, 1939]]

{{See also|135 film#History|l1=History of 135 film}}

A number of manufacturers started to use 35mm film for still photography between 1905 and 1913. The first 35mm cameras available to the public, and reaching significant numbers in sales were the Tourist Multiple, in 1913, and the Simplex, in 1914. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

[[Oskar Barnack]], who was in charge of research and development at &lt;!-- DO NOT DISAMBIGUATE, [[Leica Camera]] DID NOT EXIST UNTIL 1986; DEVELOP THE [[Ernst Leitz GmbH]] ARTICLE INSTEAD! --&gt;[[Ernst Leitz GmbH|Leitz]], decided to investigate using [[35 mm film|35&amp;nbsp;mm cine film]] for still cameras while attempting to build a [[compact camera]] capable of making high-quality enlargements. He built his prototype 35&amp;nbsp;mm camera (Ur-Leica) around 1913, though further development was delayed for several years by World War I. It wasn't until after World War I that Leica commercialized their first 35mm Cameras. Leitz test-marketed the design between 1923 and 1924, receiving enough positive feedback that the camera was put into production as the [[Leica Camera|Leica I]] (for '''Lei'''tz '''ca'''mera) in 1925. The Leica's immediate popularity spawned a number of competitors, most notably the [[Contax]] (introduced in 1932), and cemented the position of [[35 mm]] as the format of choice for high-end compact cameras.

Kodak got into the market with the [[Kodak Retina|Retina I]] in 1934, which introduced the [[135 film|135]] cartridge used in all modern 35&amp;nbsp;mm cameras. Although the Retina was comparatively inexpensive, 35&amp;nbsp;mm cameras were still out of reach for most people and rollfilm remained the format of choice for mass-market cameras. This changed in 1936 with the introduction of the inexpensive Argus A and to an even greater extent in 1939 with the arrival of the immensely popular [[Argus C3]]. Although the cheapest cameras still used rollfilm, 35&amp;nbsp;mm film had come to dominate the market by the time the C3 was discontinued in 1966.

The fledgling Japanese camera industry began to take off in 1936 with the [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] 35&amp;nbsp;mm rangefinder, an improved version of the 1933 Kwanon prototype. Japanese cameras would begin to become popular in the West after Korean War veterans and soldiers stationed in Japan brought them back to the United States and elsewhere.

The first practical reflex camera was the [[Rollei|Franke &amp; Heidecke]] [[Rolleiflex]] [[Medium format (film)|medium format]] [[Twin-lens reflex camera|TLR]] of 1928. Though both single- and twin-lens reflex cameras had been available for decades, they were too bulky to achieve much popularity. The Rolleiflex, however, was sufficiently compact to achieve widespread popularity and the medium-format TLR design became popular for both high- and low-end cameras.

A similar revolution in [[Single-lens reflex camera|SLR]] design began in 1933 with the introduction of the [[Ihagee]] [[Exakta]], a compact SLR which used [[127 film|127]] rollfilm. This was followed three years later by the first Western SLR to use [[135 film]], the Kine Exakta (World's first true [[35mm format|35mm]] SLR was [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Sport (camera)|"Sport" camera]], marketed several months before Kine Exakta, though "Sport" used its own film cartridge). The [[35mm format|35mm]] SLR design gained immediate popularity and there was an explosion of new models and innovative features after World War II. There were also a few 35mm TLRs, the best-known of which was the [[Contaflex]] of 1935, but for the most part these met with little success.

The first major post-war SLR innovation was the eye-level viewfinder, which first appeared on the Hungarian [[Duflex]] in 1947 and was refined in 1948 with the [[Contax]] S, the first camera to use a [[pentaprism]]. Prior to this, all SLRs were equipped with waist-level focusing screens. The Duflex was also the first SLR with an instant-return mirror, which prevented the viewfinder from being blacked out after  each exposure. This same time period also saw the introduction of the [[Hasselblad|Hasselblad 1600F]], which set the standard for medium format SLRs for decades.

In 1952 the [[Pentax|Asahi Optical Company]] (which later became well known for its Pentax cameras) introduced the first Japanese SLR using [[135 film]], the [[Asahiflex]]. Several other Japanese camera makers also entered the SLR market in the 1950s, including Canon, [[Yashica]], and [[Nikon]]. Nikon's entry, the [[Nikon F]], had a full line of interchangeable components and accessories and is generally regarded as the first Japanese [[system camera]]. It was the F, along with the earlier [[Nikon S|S]] series of rangefinder cameras, that helped establish Nikon's reputation as a maker of professional-quality equipment.

==Instant cameras==

[[File:Polaroid Land Camera Model J66.jpg|thumb|right|Polaroid Model J66, 1961]]

While conventional cameras were becoming more refined and sophisticated, an entirely new type of camera appeared on the market in 1948. This was the [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] Model 95, the world's first viable [[instant camera|instant-picture camera]]. Known as a [[Land Camera]] after its inventor, [[Edwin Land]], the Model 95 used a patented chemical process to produce finished positive prints from the exposed negatives in under a minute. The Land Camera caught on despite its relatively high price and the Polaroid lineup had expanded to dozens of models by the 1960s. The first Polaroid camera aimed at the popular market, the [[Polaroid Swinger|Model 20 Swinger]] of 1965, was a huge success and remains one of the top-selling cameras of all time.

==Automation==

The first camera to feature automatic [[exposure (photography)|exposure]] was the [[selenium]] [[light meter]]-equipped, fully automatic Super Kodak Six-20 pack of 1938, but its extremely high price (for the time) of $225 (${{Inflation|US|225|1938}} in present terms{{Inflation-fn|US}}) kept it from achieving any degree of success. By the 1960s, however, low-cost electronic components were commonplace and cameras equipped with light meters and automatic exposure systems became increasingly widespread.

The next technological advance came in 1960, when the German [[Mec 16 SB]] [[subminiature camera|subminiature]] became the first camera to place the light meter behind the [[photographic lens|lens]] for more accurate metering. However, [[through-the-lens]] metering ultimately became a feature more commonly found on SLRs than other types of camera; the first SLR equipped with a TTL system was the [[Topcon|Topcon RE Super]] of 1962.

==Digital cameras==
{{See also|DSLR#History}}
[[Digital camera]]s differ from their analog predecessors primarily in that they do not use film, but capture and save photographs on digital memory cards or internal storage instead.  Their low operating costs have relegated chemical cameras to [[niche market]]s. Digital cameras now include wireless communication capabilities (for example [[Wi-Fi]] or [[Bluetooth]]) to transfer, print or share photos, and are commonly found on [[Camera phone|mobile phones]].

===Early development===

The concept of digitizing images on scanners, and the concept of digitizing video signals, predate the concept of making still pictures by digitizing signals from an array of discrete sensor elements.  Early [[spy satellites]] used the extremely complex and expensive method of de-orbit and airborne retrieval of film canisters.  Technology was pushed to skip these steps through the use of in-satellite developing and electronic scanning of the film for direct transmission to the ground.  The amount of film was still a major limitation, and this was overcome and greatly simplified by the push to develop an electronic image capturing array that could be used instead of film.  The first electronic imaging satellite was the [[KH-11]] launched by the [[National Reconnaissance Office|NRO]] in late 1976.  It had a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) array with a resolution of {{nowrap|800 x 800 pixels}} (0.64 megapixels).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/systems/kh-11.htm globalsecurity.org – KH-11 KENNAN], 24 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  At Philips Labs in New York, [[Edward Stupp]], [[Pieter Cath]] and [[Zsolt Szilagyi (scientist)|Zsolt Szilagyi]] filed for a patent on "All Solid State Radiation Imagers" on 6 September 1968 and constructed a flat-screen target for receiving and storing an optical image on a matrix composed of an array of photodiodes connected to a capacitor to form an array of two terminal devices connected in rows and columns. Their US patent was granted on 10 November 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|US|3540011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Texas Instruments engineer [[Willis Adcock]] designed a filmless camera that was not digital and applied for a patent in 1972, but it is not known whether it was ever built.&lt;ref name="digicamhistory_1970s"&gt;{{Cite patent|US|4057830}} and {{Cite patent|US|4163256}} were filed in 1972 but were only later awarded in 1976 and 1977. {{cite web|url=http://www.digicamhistory.com/1970s.html|title=1970s|accessdate=15 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cromemco CYCLOPS]] introduced as a hobbyist construction project in 1975&lt;ref name="PE"&gt;{{Cite journal

The prototype camera was a technical exercise, not intended for production.

===Analog electronic cameras===
[[File:Sony Mavica 1981 prototype CP+ 2011.jpg|thumb|Sony Mavica, 1981]]
{{main|Still video camera}}

Handheld electronic cameras, in the sense of a device meant to be carried and used like a handheld film camera, appeared in 1981 with the demonstration of the [[Sony Mavica]] (Magnetic Video Camera). This is not to be confused with the later cameras by Sony that also bore the Mavica name. This was an analog camera, in that it recorded pixel signals continuously, as videotape machines did, without converting them to discrete levels; it recorded television-like signals to a 2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;inch "[[video floppy]]".&lt;ref&gt;

In essence it was a video movie camera that recorded single frames, 50 per disk in field mode and 25 per disk in frame mode. The image quality was considered equal to that of then-current televisions.

[[File:Canon RC-701 img 0829.jpg|thumb|Canon RC-701, 1986]]

Analog electronic cameras do not appear to have reached the market until 1986 with the Canon RC-701. Canon demonstrated a prototype of this model at the [[1984 Summer Olympics]], printing the images in the ''[[Yomiuri Shinbun]]'', a Japanese newspaper. In the United States, the first publication to use these cameras for real reportage was [[USA Today]], in its coverage of World Series baseball. Several factors held back the widespread adoption of analog cameras; the cost (upwards of [[United States Dollar|$]]20,000), poor image quality compared to film, and the lack of quality affordable printers. Capturing and printing an image originally required access to equipment such as a frame grabber, which was beyond the reach of the average consumer. The "video floppy" disks later had several reader devices available for viewing on a screen, but were never standardized as a computer drive.

The early adopters tended to be in the news media, where the cost was negated by the utility and the ability to transmit images by telephone lines. The poor image quality was offset by the low resolution of newspaper graphics. This capability to transmit images without a satellite link was useful during the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] and the first [[Gulf War]] in 1991.

US government agencies also took a strong interest in the still video concept, notably the US Navy for use as a real time air-to-sea surveillance system.

The first analog electronic camera marketed to consumers may have been the Casio VS-101 in 1987. A notable analog camera produced the same year was the [http://imaging.nikon.com/history/chronicle/cousins16-e/ Nikon QV-1000C], designed as a press camera and not offered for sale to general users, which sold only a few hundred units. It recorded images in [[greyscale]], and the quality in newspaper print was equal to film cameras. In appearance it closely resembled a modern digital [[single-lens reflex camera]]. Images were stored on video floppy disks.

Silicon Film, a proposed digital sensor cartridge for film cameras that would allow 35&amp;nbsp;mm cameras to take digital photographs without modification was announced in late 1998. Silicon Film was to work like a roll of 35&amp;nbsp;mm film, with a 1.3 [[megapixel]] sensor behind the lens and a battery and storage unit fitting in the film holder in the camera.  The product, which was never released, became increasingly obsolete due to improvements in digital camera technology and affordability. Silicon Films' parent company filed for bankruptcy in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dpreview.com/news/0109/01091702siliconfilmvaporizes.asp| title=Silicon Film – vaporized-ware| first=Phil| last=Askey| year=2001| accessdate=20 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival of true digital cameras===
[[File:Minolta RD-175 Digital SLR.JPG|thumb|The first portable digital SLR camera, introduced by Minolta in 1995.]]
[[File:Capas-d1.jpg|thumb|Nikon D1, 1999]]

By the late 1980s, the technology required to produce truly commercial digital cameras existed. The first true portable digital camera that recorded images as a computerized file was likely the [[Fujifilm|Fuji]] DS-1P of 1988, which recorded to a 2&amp;nbsp;MB SRAM memory card that used a battery to keep the data in memory. This camera was never marketed to the public.

The first digital camera of any kind ever sold commercially was possibly the MegaVision Tessera in 1987 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mega-vision.com/why_Measured_Photography.html MegaVision Professional Camera Backs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; though there is not extensive documentation of its sale known. The first ''portable'' digital camera that was actually marketed commercially was sold in December 1989 in Japan, the DS-X by

It used a CCD [[image sensor]], stored pictures digitally, and connected directly to a computer for download.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 1990 | work = digicammuseum.com | url = http://www.digicammuseum.com/en/history | accessdate = 17 September 2007 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Dycam Model 1: The world's first consumer digital still camera | work = DigiBarn computer museum | url = http://www.digibarn.com/collections/cameras/dycam-model1/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn Said, "DYCAM Model 1: The first portable Digital Still Camera", ''MacWeek'', vol. 4, No. 35, 16 Oct. 1990, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Kodak brought to market the [[Kodak DCS]] (Kodak Digital Camera System), the beginning of a long line of professional [[Kodak DCS]] SLR cameras that were based in part on film bodies, often Nikons. It used a 1.3&amp;nbsp;megapixel sensor, had a bulky external digital storage system and was priced at $13,000. At the arrival of the [[Kodak DCS-200]], the [[Kodak DCS]] was dubbed [[Kodak DCS-100]].

The move to digital formats was helped by the formation of the first [[JPEG]] and [[MPEG]] standards in 1988, which allowed image and video files to be compressed for storage. The first consumer camera with a liquid crystal display on the back was the [[Casio]] [[QV-10]] developed by a team led by [[Hiroyuki Suetaka]] in 1995. The first camera to use [[CompactFlash]] was the [[Kodak DC-25]] in 1996.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}. The first camera that offered the ability to record [[video]] clips may have been the [[Ricoh RDC-1]] in 1995.

In 1995 Minolta introduced the [[Minolta RD-175|RD-175]], which was based on the Minolta 500si SLR with a splitter and three independent CCDs. This combination delivered 1.75M pixels. The benefit of using an SLR base was the ability to use any existing Minolta AF mount lens. 1999 saw the introduction of the [[Nikon D1]], a 2.74&amp;nbsp;megapixel camera that was the first [[digital SLR]] developed entirely from the ground up by a major manufacturer, and at a cost of under $6,000 at introduction was affordable by professional photographers and high-end consumers. This camera also used Nikon F-mount lenses, which meant film photographers could use many of the same lenses they already owned.

Digital camera sales continued to flourish, driven by technology advances. The digital market segmented into different categories, Compact Digital Still Cameras, Bridge Cameras, Mirrorless Compacts and Digital SLRs. One of the major technology advances was the development of [[CMOS]] sensors, which helped drive sensor costs low enough to enable the widespread adoption of camera phones.

Since 2003, digital cameras have outsold film cameras&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macworld.com/article/1039455/digitalfilm.html Digital outsells film, but film still king to some | Macworld&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kodak]] announced in January 2004 that they would no longer sell Kodak-branded film cameras in the [[developed world]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/01/20/kodak_to_drop_35mm_cameras/ | title=Kodak to drop 35mm cameras in Europe, US | first=Tony | last=Smith | date=2004-01-20 | publisher=The Register | accessdate=2007-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  - and 2012 filed for bankruptcy after struggling to adapt to the changing industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/01/19/eastman-kodak-files-for-bankruptcy/ | work=The New York Times | title=Eastman Kodak Files for Bankruptcy | date=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Smartphone]]s now routinely include high resolution digital cameras.

[[File:Réchaud de gaz de dirigeant.JPG|thumb|Lafare's portable gas stove 1932]]
[[File:Camping gaz.jpg|thumb|A modern gas cartridge for a portable stove]]
The '''portable gas stove''' is a combination of portability and functionality; combining the light weight of a small gas canister with the heat output needed to cook a meal. Portable stoves in modern times can be divided into several broad categories based on the type of fuel used and the design of the [[aluminium]] stoving frame. Unpressurised stoves use solid/liquid fuel placed in the burner before ignition. Combustible stove hangers use a form of volatile liquid fuel in a pressurized burner i.e. [[bottled gas]] stoves. They originate from the gravity-fed 1932 "spirit" stoves or ''réchaud de gaz de dirigeant''.

==Origins==
The production of the ''réchaud de gaz de dirigeant'' (Portable gas stove) was commissioned and begun in the workshop of the industrial designer Jue Lafare (born April 7, 1896) in 1932 after he placed his plan for a portable gas cooker before the [[French Army]] two and a half years earlier.

==Early introduction==
By 1934 Lafare's portable cooker was in [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] ranks and within the next 16 months would come to be a staple of every officer in the French army. Due to fear of common misuse by soldiers of lower ranks obtaining the cookers without consent, the army requested that all instructional writing be placed upon the cookers in English as only the officers were taught fluency in English.

==Military applications==
Unfortunately Lafares design, however brilliant, was not enough to stop the German ranks marching over his homeland in 1940 after only 6 weeks. The majority of ''réchaud de gaz de dirigeant'' were melted down into what can only be assumed as scrap metal for the German war machine. However, from Jeu Lafare's stove the idea was adapted in various forms around the world during [[World War II]] and afterwards. Examples can be seen in many military originations around the world today with the American 'Bunga' or Japanese '携帯用ガス炊飯器'. Today there are estimated to be less than 80 of Lafare's original Full Blue French made with English writing ''réchaud de gaz de dirigeant''. Although the stove was a wonderful invention, the Germans were incredible in their precision at melting them down in such a systematic way.

==Rarity==
As mentioned above, examples of Lafare's original full blue French made ''réchaud de gaz de dirigeant'' are extremely rare. The War Memorial Museum in [[Boulogne]], France, paid 390EU for the piece pictured above in their collection some 20 years ago. However, it should be pointed out that the gas canister is a later 1940s Deutsch army model.

For thousands of years, devices have been used to measure and keep track of [[time]]. The current [[sexagesimal]] [[Numeral system|system]] of time [[systems of measurement|measurement]] dates to approximately 2000&amp;nbsp;[[Anno Domini|{{sc|bc}}]]&lt;!--See talk page--&gt; from the  [[Sumer]]ians.

The  Egyptians divided the day into two 12-hour periods, and used large [[obelisk]]s to track the movement of the [[sun]]. They also developed [[water clock]]s, which were probably first used in the [[Precinct of Amun-Re]], and later outside Egypt as well; they were employed frequently by the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], who called them ''clepsydrae''. The [[Zhou dynasty]] is believed to have used the outflow water clock around the same time, devices which were introduced from [[Mesopotamia]] as early as 2000{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}.

Other ancient timekeeping devices include the [[candle clock]], used in [[ancient China]], [[ancient Japan]], [[England]] and Mesopotamia; the [[Sundial#Shepherd dials – Timesticks|timestick]], widely used in [[India]] and [[Tibet]], as well as some parts of [[Europe]]; and the [[hourglass]], which functioned similarly to a water clock.  The [[sundial]], another early clock, relies on shadows to provide a good estimate of the hour on a sunny day.  It is not so useful in cloudy weather or at night and requires recalibration as the seasons change (if the [[gnomon]] was not aligned with the [[Earth's axis]]).

The earliest known clock with a [[water-power]]ed [[escapement]] mechanism, which transferred [[rotational energy]] into intermittent motions,&lt;ref name="Samual l. Jackson 18f."&gt;David Landes: "Revolution in Time: Clocks and the Making of the Modern World", rev. and enlarged edition, Harvard University Press, Cambridge 2000, {{ISBN|0-674-00282-2}}, p.18f.&lt;/ref&gt; dates back to 3rd century{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} in [[ancient Greece]];&lt;ref name="Lewis 2000 356f"&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2000|pp=343–369 (356f.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Science and technology in China|Chinese engineers]] later invented clocks incorporating [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]-powered escapement mechanisms in the 10th century,&lt;ref name="needham 411"/&gt; followed by [[Inventions in medieval Islam|Iranian engineers]] inventing water clocks driven by [[gear]]s and [[Maintaining power|weights]] in the 11th century.&lt;ref name=Hassan/&gt;

The first [[mechanical clock]]s, employing the [[verge escapement]] mechanism with a [[Balance wheel|foliot]] or [[balance wheel]] timekeeper, were invented in Europe at around the start of the 14th century, and became the standard timekeeping device until the [[pendulum clock]] was invented in 1656.  The invention of the [[mainspring]] in the early 15th century allowed portable clocks to be built, evolving into the first [[pocketwatch]]es by the 17th century, but these were not very accurate until the [[balance spring]] was added to the balance wheel in the mid 17th century.

The pendulum clock remained the most accurate timekeeper until the 1930s, when [[quartz oscillator]]s were invented, followed by [[atomic clock]]s after World War 2. Although initially limited to laboratories, the development of [[microelectronics]] in the 1960s made [[quartz clock]]s both compact and cheap to produce, and by the 1980s they became the world's dominant timekeeping technology in both clocks and [[wristwatch]]es.

Atomic clocks are far more accurate than any previous timekeeping device, and are used to calibrate other clocks and to calculate the [[International Atomic Time]]; a [[standardized]] civil system, [[Coordinated Universal Time]], is based on atomic time.

Egyptian shadow clocks divided [[Daytime (astronomy)|daytime]] into 12 parts with each part further divided into more precise parts.&lt;ref name="One of world's oldest sundials dug up in Kings' Valley, Upper Egypt"/&gt; One type of shadow clock consisted of a long stem with five variable marks and an elevated crossbar which cast a shadow over those marks. It was positioned eastward in the morning, and was turned west at noon.&lt;!--Why?--&gt; Obelisks functioned in much the same manner: the shadow cast on the markers around it allowed the Egyptians to calculate the time. The obelisk also indicated whether it was morning or afternoon, as well as the [[summer solstice|summer]] and [[winter solstice|winter]] [[solstice]]s.&lt;ref name=bruton/&gt;&lt;ref name="NIST"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/GenInt/Time/early.html |title=Earliest Clocks |work=A Walk Through Time |accessdate=2 April 2008 |publisher=NIST Physics Laboratory| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080315060613/http://physics.nist.gov/GenInt/Time/early.html| archivedate=March 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third shadow clock, developed c. 1500{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, was similar in shape to a bent [[T-square]]. It measured the passage of time by the shadow cast by its crossbar on a non-linear rule. The ''T'' was oriented eastward in the mornings, and turned around at [[noon]], so that it could cast its shadow in the opposite direction.&lt;ref name=barnett&gt;Barnett, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Although accurate, shadow clocks relied on the sun, and so were useless at night and in cloudy weather.&lt;ref name="NIST" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Library of Congress"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/mysteries/hourglass.html |title= How does an hourglass measure time? |accessdate=31 March 2008|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptians therefore developed a number of alternative timekeeping instruments, including water clocks, and a system for tracking star movements. The oldest description of a water clock is from the tomb inscription of the 16th-century{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} Egyptian court official Amenemhet, identifying him as its inventor.&lt;ref&gt;Berlev, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; There were several types of water clocks, some more elaborate than others. One type consisted of a bowl with small holes in its bottom, which was floated on water and allowed to fill at a near-constant rate; markings on the side of the bowl indicated elapsed time, as the surface of the water reached them. The oldest-known waterclock was found in the tomb of [[pharaoh]] [[Amenhotep I]] (1525–1504{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}), suggesting that they were first used in ancient Egypt.&lt;ref name="NIST"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philbin, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cotterell, pp. 59–61&lt;/ref&gt; Another Egyptian method of determining the time during the night was using [[Plumb-bob|plumb-lines]] called [[merkhet]]s. In use since at least 600{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, two of these instruments were aligned with [[Polaris]], the north [[pole star]], to create a north–south [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]]. The time was accurately measured by observing certain stars as they crossed the line created with the ''merkhets''.&lt;ref name="NIST" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Time in History"&gt;Whitrow, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

The vat held a steadily increasing amount of water, supplied by a cistern. By morning, the vessel would have floated high enough to tip over, causing the lead balls to cascade onto a copper platter. The resultant clangor would then awaken Plato's students at the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Another possibility is that it comprised two jars, connected by a [[siphon]]. Water emptied until it reached the siphon, which transported the water to the other jar. There, the rising water would force air through a whistle, sounding an alarm.&lt;ref name=answers.com /&gt; The Greeks and [[Chaldean Dynasty|Chaldeans]] regularly maintained timekeeping records as an essential part of their astronomical observations.

[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] astronomer, [[Andronicus of Cyrrhus]], supervised the construction of the [[Tower of the Winds]] in Athens in the 1st century{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}.
[[File:Aerides Athens 2.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Tower of the Winds]] in [[Athens]], Greece, a 1st-century-BC [[clocktower]] from the period of [[Roman Greece]]]]
In Greek tradition, clepsydrae were used in [[court]]; later, the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] adopted this practice, as well. There are several mentions of this in historical records and literature of the era; for example, in ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', [[Plato]] says that "Those men, on the other hand, always speak in haste, for the flowing water urges them on".&lt;ref name="Water clocks in court"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H8YOAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Greek and Roman Technology: A Sourcebook|last=Humphrey|first=John William|year=1998|publisher=[[Routledge]]|pages=518–519|accessdate=11 April 2008|isbn=0-415-06136-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another mention occurs in [[Lucius Apuleius]]' ''[[The Golden Ass]]'': "The Clerk of the Court began bawling again, this time summoning the chief witness for the prosecution to appear. Up stepped an old man, whom I did not know. He was invited to speak for as long as there was water in the clock; this was a hollow globe into which water was poured through a funnel in the neck, and from which it gradually escaped through fine perforations at the base".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Transformations of Lucius, Otherwise Known as The Golden Ass|last=Apuleius|first=Lucius|others=Translated by Robert Graves|publisher=[[Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux]]|location=[[New York, New York]]|year=1951|page=54|authorlink3=Apuleius|isbn=0-374-50532-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clock in Apuleius's account was one of several types of water clock used. Another consisted of a bowl with a hole in its centre, which was floated on water. Time was kept by observing how long the bowl took to fill with water.&lt;ref name="Waterclockhistory"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Rees, Abraham |title=Rees's clocks, watches, and chronometers (1819–20); a selection from the Cyclopaedia, or Universal dictionary of arts, sciences, and literature |publisher=C.

Although clepsydrae were more useful than sundials—they could be used indoors, during the night, and also when the sky was cloudy—they were not as accurate; the Greeks, therefore, sought a way to improve their water clocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-QcE2pBCLE8C&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Empires of Time: Calendars, Clocks, and Cultures|last=Aveni|first=Anthony F.|publisher=Tauris Parke Paperbacks|year=2000|isbn=1-86064-602-6|accessdate=22 June 2008|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although still not as accurate as sundials, Greek water clocks became more accurate around 325{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, and they were adapted to have a face with an hour hand, making the reading of the clock more precise and convenient. One of the more common problems in most types of clepsydrae was caused by [[water pressure]]: when the container holding the water was full, the increased pressure caused the water to flow more rapidly. This problem was addressed by Greek and Roman [[horology|horologists]] beginning in 100{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, and improvements continued to be made in the following centuries. To counteract the increased water flow, the clock's water containers—usually bowls or jugs—were given a conical shape; positioned with the wide end up, a greater amount of water had to flow out in order to drop the same distance as when the water was lower in the cone. Along with this improvement, clocks were constructed more elegantly in this period, with hours marked by gongs, doors opening to miniature figurines, bells, or moving mechanisms.&lt;ref name="NIST" /&gt; There were some remaining problems, however, which were never solved, such as the effect of temperature. Water flows more slowly when cold, or may even freeze.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Collier, James Lincoln |title=Clocks |publisher=Benchmark Books |location=[[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]], NY |year=2003 |page=25 |isbn=0-7614-1538-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 270{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} and {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}500, [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] ([[Ctesibius]], [[Hero of Alexandria]], [[Archimedes]]) and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[horology|horologists]] and [[astronomer]]s began developing more elaborate mechanized water clocks. The added complexity was aimed at regulating the flow and at providing fancier displays of the passage of time. For example, some water clocks rang [[bell (instrument)|bells]] and [[gong]]s, while others opened doors and windows to show figurines of people, or moved pointers, and dials. Some even displayed [[astrology|astrological]] models of the universe.

Although the Greeks and Romans did much to advance water clock technology, they still continued to use shadow clocks. The mathematician and astronomer [[Theodosius of Bithynia]], for example, is said to have invented a universal sundial that was accurate anywhere on Earth, though little is known about it.&lt;ref name=oconnor&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Connor |first=J.

[[File:Ancient water clock used in qanat of gonabad 2500 years ago.JPG|thumb|Ancient Persian clock]]
[[File:میرآب.JPG|thumb|Reconstruction of the scene of a water clock manager (MirAab), Iran]]
According to [[Callisthenes]], the [[Persia]]ns were using [[water clock]]s in 328{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} to ensure a just and exact distribution of water from [[qanat]]s to their shareholders for agricultural irrigation. The use of water clocks in [[Iran]], especially in [[Zeebad]], dates back to 500{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}. Later they were also used to determine the exact holy days of pre-Islamic religions, such as the ''[[Nowruz]]'', ''Chelah'', or ''[[Yaldā]]'' – the shortest, longest, and equal-length days and nights of the years. The water clocks used in Iran were one of the most practical ancient tools for timing the yearly calendar.&lt;ref name=Qanat&gt;[http://www.aftabir.com/articles/view/science_education/technical/c3c1183387267p1.php/%D9%82%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%85%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AB-%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%87%D9%86%DA%AF%DB%8C-%D9%88-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%85%DB%8C-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86 Conference of Qanat in Iran – water clock in Persia 1383], in Persian&lt;/ref&gt;

Water clocks, or ''Fenjaan'', in Persia reached a level of accuracy comparable to today's standards of timekeeping. The fenjaan was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for calculating the amount or the time that a farmer must take water from a [[qanat]] or well for irrigation of the farms, until it was replaced by more accurate current clock.&lt;ref name=Qanat/&gt; Persian water clocks were a practical and useful tool for the qanat's shareholders to calculate the length of time they could divert water to their farm. The qanat was the only water source for agriculture and irrigation so a just and fair water distribution was very important. Therefore, a very fair and clever old person was elected to be the manager of the water clock, and at least two full-time managers were needed to control and observe the number of fenjaans and announce the exact time during the days and nights.&lt;ref name="Fenjaan"&gt;[http://amordadnews.com/neveshtehNamyesh.aspx?NId=6010 سايه‌ي شهرداري نجف‌آباد بر كهن‌ترين «ساعت آبي»‌ شهر] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429163019/http://amordadnews.com/neveshtehNamyesh.aspx?NId=6010 |date=April 29, 2014 }} Amordad News (in Persian)&lt;/ref&gt;

The fenjaan was a big pot full of water and a bowl with small hole in the center. When the bowl become full of water, it would sink into the pot, and the manager would empty the bowl and again put it on the top of the water in the pot. He would record the number of times the bowl sank by putting small stones into a jar.&lt;ref name="Fenjaan"/&gt;

The place where the clock was situated, and its managers, were collectively known as ''khaneh fenjaan''. Usually this would be the top floor of a public-house, with west- and east-facing windows to show the time of sunset and sunrise. There was also another time-keeping tool named a ''staryab'' or [[astrolabe]], but it was mostly used for superstitious beliefs and was not practical for use as a farmers' calendar. The Zeebad Gonabad water clock was in use until 1965 when it was substituted by modern clocks.&lt;ref name=Qanat/&gt;

===Ancient and medieval China===
{{See also|History of science and technology in China|Su Song}}
[[Joseph Needham]] speculated that the introduction of the outflow clepsydra to China, perhaps from [[Mesopotamia]], occurred as far back as the 2nd millennium{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, during the [[Shang Dynasty]], and at the latest by the 1st millennium{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}. By the beginning of the [[Han Dynasty]], in 202{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, the outflow clepsydra was gradually replaced by the inflow clepsydra, which featured an indicator rod on a float. To compensate for the falling [[pressure head]] in the reservoir, which slowed timekeeping as the vessel filled, [[Zhang Heng]] added an extra tank between the reservoir and the inflow vessel. Around 550 AD, Yin Gui was the first in China to write of the overflow or constant-level tank added to the series, which was later described in detail by the inventor [[Shen Kuo]]. Around 610, this design was trumped by two [[Sui Dynasty]] inventors, Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai, who were the first to create the balance clepsydra, with standard positions for the [[steelyard balance]].&lt;ref name=needham&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Joseph |last=Needham |authorlink=Joseph Needham|year=1986 |title=Science and Civilization in China |volume=4 |journal=Physics and Physical Technology, Part 2: Mechanical Engineering |location=Taipei |publisher=Caves Books, Ltd |pages=479–480 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Needham states that:
{{quote|text=...&amp;nbsp;[the balance clepsydra] permitted the seasonal adjustment of the pressure head in the compensating tank by having standard positions for the counterweight graduated on the beam, and hence it could control the rate of flow for different lengths of day and night. With this arrangement no overflow tank was required, and the two attendants were warned when the clepsydra needed refilling.&lt;ref name=needham/&gt;}}

==Timekeeping innovations in medieval and pre-modern periods==
The term '[[clock]]' encompasses a wide spectrum of devices, ranging from [[wristwatch]]es to the [[Clock of the Long Now]]. The English word ''clock'' is said to derive from the [[Middle English]] ''clokke'', [[Old French|Old North French]] ''cloque'', or [[Middle Dutch]] ''clocke'', all of which mean ''[[Bell (instrument)|bell]]'', and are derived from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''clocca'', also meaning bell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=clock |title=Clock Etymology |accessdate=27 April 2008|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Clock|title=Merriam-Webster Online: Clock|accessdate=20 June 2008|work=[[Webster's Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]] |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/31/C0413100.html |accessdate=4 December 2007 |edition=Fourth |isbn=0-395-82517-2 |author=executive editor, Joseph P.

===Candle clocks===
{{Main|Candle clock}}
[[Image:Kerzenuhr.jpg|thumb|right|A [[candle clock]]]]
The earliest mention of [[candle clock]]s comes from a Chinese poem, written in {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}520 by You Jianfu. According to the poem, the graduated candle was a means of determining time at night. Similar candles were used in Japan until the early 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwmagazine.com/education_history.cfm |title=History of Time |accessdate=8 April 2008 |last=Flamer |first=Keith |year=2006|work=International Watch Magazine|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716162954/http://www.iwmagazine.com/education_history.cfm|archivedate=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The candle clock most commonly mentioned and written of is attributed to King [[Alfred the Great]]. It consisted of six candles made from 72&amp;nbsp;[[pennyweight]]s of wax, each {{convert|12|in|cm}} high, and of uniform thickness, marked every inch (2.54&amp;nbsp;cm). As these candles burned for about four hours, each mark represented 20&amp;nbsp;minutes. Once lit, the candles were placed in wooden framed glass boxes, to prevent the flame from extinguishing.&lt;ref name="alfred"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' |url=http://kids.britannica.com/clockworks/t_candle.html |title=Clockworks: Candle clock |accessdate=16 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126001057/http://kids.britannica.com/clockworks/t_candle.html |archivedate=November 26, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most sophisticated candle clocks of their time were those of [[Al-Jazari]] in 1206. One of his candle clocks included a [[Dial (measurement)|dial]] to display the time and, for the first time, employed a [[Bayonet mount|bayonet fitting]], a [[Fastener|fastening mechanism]] still used in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ancient Discoveries, Episode 12: Machines of the East|publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwGfw1YW9Js|accessdate=7 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Routledge Hill]] described Al-Jazari's candle clocks as follows:

{{quote|The candle, whose rate of burning was known, bore against the underside of the cap, and its wick passed through the hole. Wax collected in the indentation and could be removed periodically so that it did not interfere with steady burning. The bottom of the candle rested in a shallow dish that had a ring on its side connected through pulleys to a counterweight. As the candle burned away, the weight pushed it upward at a constant speed. The automata were operated from the dish at the bottom of the candle. No other candle clocks of this sophistication are known.&lt;ref name=Hill2/&gt;}}

[[Image:Oil-lamp clock00.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An [[oil-lamp clock]]]]

A variation on this theme were [[oil-lamp clock]]s. These early timekeeping devices consisted of a graduated glass reservoir to hold oil — usually whale oil, which burned cleanly and evenly — supplying the fuel for a built-in lamp. As the level in the reservoir dropped, it provided a rough measure of the passage of time.

In addition to water, mechanical, and candle clocks, [[incense clock]]s were used in the [[Far East]], and were fashioned in several different forms.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; [[Incense]] clocks were first used in China around the 6th century; in Japan, one still exists in the [[Shōsōin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Eastern Magnificence and European Ingenuity: Clocks of Late Imperial China|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8bXxHSZkWssC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA209,M1|last=Pagani|first=Catherine|page=209|isbn=0-472-11208-2|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; although its characters are not Chinese, but [[Devanagari]].&lt;ref name="Schafer"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QerLX9x8pIkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA160,M1|title=The Golden Peaches of Samarkand: A Study of T'ang Exotics|pages=160–161|last=Schafer|first=Edward|year=1963|isbn=0-520-05462-8|publisher=[[University of California Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their frequent use of Devanagari characters, suggestive of their use in [[Buddhist]] ceremonies, [[Edward H.

Incense seal clocks were used for similar occasions and events as the stick clock; while religious purposes were of primary importance,&lt;ref name="Burning rates"/&gt; these clocks were also popular at social gatherings, and were used by Chinese scholars and intellectuals.&lt;ref name="Bedini103"&gt;Bedini, pp. 103–104&lt;/ref&gt; The seal was a wooden or stone disk with one or more grooves etched in it&lt;ref name="Burning rates"/&gt; into which incense was placed.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; These clocks were common in China,&lt;ref name="Bedini103"/&gt; but were produced in fewer numbers in Japan.&lt;ref name="Bedini187"/&gt; To signal the passage of a specific amount of time, small pieces of fragrant woods, resins, or different scented incenses could be placed on the incense powder trails.

While early incense seals were made of wood or stone, the Chinese gradually introduced disks made of metal, most likely beginning during the [[Song dynasty]]. This allowed craftsmen to more easily create both large and small seals, as well as design and decorate them more aesthetically. Another advantage was the ability to vary the paths of the grooves, to allow for the changing length of the days in the year. As smaller seals became more readily available, the clocks grew in popularity among the Chinese, and were often given as gifts.&lt;ref&gt;Bedini, pp. 104–106&lt;/ref&gt; Incense seal clocks are often sought by modern-day clock collectors; however, few remain that have not already been purchased or been placed on display at museums or temples.&lt;ref name="Bedini187"&gt;Bedini, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sundials===
{{Main|Sundial}}
[[Image:SevillaGlorietaDelReloj01.JPG|thumb|A 20th-century [[sundial]] in [[Seville]], [[Andalusia]], Spain]]
Sundials had been used for timekeeping since [[Ancient Egypt]]. Ancient dials were nodus-based with straight hour-lines that indicated unequal hours—also called temporary hours—that varied with the seasons. Every day was divided into 12&amp;nbsp;equal segments regardless of the time of year; thus, hours were shorter in winter and longer in summer. The [[sundial]] was further developed by [[Islamic astronomy|Muslim astronomers]]. The idea of using hours of equal length throughout the year was the innovation of Abu'l-Hasan [[Ibn al-Shatir]] in 1371, based on earlier developments in [[trigonometry]] by [[Muhammad ibn Jābir al-Harrānī al-Battānī]] (Albategni). Ibn al-Shatir was aware that "using a [[gnomon]] that is parallel to the Earth's axis will produce sundials whose hour lines indicate equal hours on any day of the year". His sundial is the oldest polar-axis sundial still in existence. The concept appeared in Western sundials starting in 1446.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the sundial |url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.353 |publisher=[[National Maritime Museum]] |accessdate=2 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010044606/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.353 |archivedate=October 10, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Sundial And Geometry|first=Lawrence|last=Jones|journal=North American Sundial Society|volume=12|issue=4|date=December 2005|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the acceptance of [[heliocentrism]] and equal hours, as well as advances in trigonometry, sundials appeared in their present form during the [[Renaissance]], when they were built in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Mayall, Margaret W. |author2=Mayall, R.

Similarly, [[Giuseppe Biancani|Giuseppe Biancani's]] ''Constructio instrumenti ad horologia solaria'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1620) discusses how to construct sundials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nicolaseverino.it/Articoli/international%20bibliography.pdf |format=PDF| title=Bibliografia della Gnomonica|accessdate=21 June 2008|publisher=British Sundial Society|author=Aked, Charles K.|author2=Severino, Nicola |year=1997|page=119|language=la}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hourglass===
{{Main|Hourglass}}
Since the [[hourglass]] was one of the few reliable methods of measuring time at sea, it is speculated that it was used on board ships as far back as the 11th century, when it would have complemented the magnetic compass as an aid to navigation. However, the earliest unambiguous evidence of their use appears in the painting ''Allegory of Good Government'', by [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]], from 1338.&lt;ref&gt;Frugoni p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; From the 15th century onwards, hourglasses were used in a wide range of applications at sea, in churches, in industry, and in cooking; they were the first dependable, reusable, reasonably accurate, and easily constructed time-measurement devices. The hourglass also took on symbolic meanings, such as that of death, temperance, opportunity, and [[Father Time]], usually represented as a bearded, old man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Macey, Samuel L. |title=Encyclopedia of Time |publisher=Garland Pub |location=New York |year=1994 |isbn=0-8153-0615-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=F7wNQk219KMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA209,M1|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though also used in China, the [[hourglass]]'s history there is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Blaut|first=James Morris|title=Eight Eurocentric Historians|publisher=Guildford Press|year=2000|isbn=1-57230-591-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ktn7LmLgc6oC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA186,M1|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] navigator [[Ferdinand Magellan]] used 18 hourglasses on each ship during his circumnavigation of the globe in 1522.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Bergreen, Laurence |title=Over the Edge of the World: Magellan's Terrifying Circumnavigation of the Globe |publisher=Morrow |location=New York |year=2003 |isbn=0-06-621173-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uK9d2EFrMJIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA53,M1|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clocks with gears and escapements===
The earliest instance of a liquid-driven escapement was described by the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] engineer [[Philo of Byzantium]] (fl. 3rd century{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}) in his technical treatise ''Pneumatics'' (chapter 31) where he likens the escapement mechanism of a [[washstand]] [[automaton]] with those as employed in (water) clocks.&lt;ref name="Lewis 2000 356f"/&gt; Another early clock to use [[escapement]]s was built during the 7th century in [[Chang'an]], by [[Vajrayana|Tantric]] monk and mathematician, [[Yi Xing]], and government official [[Liang Lingzan]].&lt;ref name="ASME"&gt;{{Cite book|last=American Society of Mechanical Engineers|title=Proceedings of the 2002 ASME Design Engineering Technical Conferences|year=2002|publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers|isbn=0-7918-3624-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shafer"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Schafer | first = Edward H. | authorlink = Edward H.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[It] was made in the image of the round heavens and on it were shown the lunar mansions in their order, the equator and the degrees of the heavenly circumference. Water, flowing into scoops, turned a wheel automatically, rotating it one complete revolution in one day and night. Besides this, there were two rings fitted around the celestial sphere outside, having the sun and moon threaded on them, and these were made to move in circling orbit&amp;nbsp;... And they made a wooden casing the surface of which represented the horizon, since the instrument was half sunk in it. It permitted the exact determinations of the time of dawns and dusks, full and new moons, tarrying and hurrying. Moreover, there were two wooden jacks standing on the horizon surface, having one a bell and the other a drum in front of it, the bell being struck automatically to indicate the hours, and the drum being beaten automatically to indicate the quarters. All these motions were brought about by machinery within the casing, each depending on wheels and shafts, hooks, pins and interlocking rods, stopping devices and locks checking mutually.&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0008/000817/081712eo.pdf |title=The mechanical clock |work=[[UNESCO Courier]] |accessdate=16 April 2008 | date=October 1988|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Yi Xing's clock was a [[water clock]], it was affected by temperature variations. That problem was solved in 976 by [[Zhang Sixun]] by replacing the water with [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], which remains liquid down to {{convert|-39|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. Zhang implemented the changes into his [[clock tower]], which was about {{convert|10|m}} tall, with escapements to keep the clock turning and bells to signal every quarter-hour. Another noteworthy clock, the elaborate Cosmic Engine, was built by [[Su Song]], in 1088. It was about the size of Zhang's tower, but had an automatically rotating [[armillary sphere]]—also called a celestial globe—from which the positions of the stars could be observed. It also featured five panels with [[mannequins]] ringing gongs or bells, and tablets showing the time of day, or other special times.&lt;ref name="NIST" /&gt; Furthermore, it featured the first known endless power-transmitting [[chain drive]] in horology.&lt;ref name="needham 411"&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Joseph |last=Needham |authorlink=Joseph Needham|year=1986 |title=Science and Civilization in China |volume=4 |journal=Physics and Physical Technology, Part 2: Mechanical Engineering |location=Taipei |publisher=Caves Books, Ltd |page=411 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally built in the capital of [[Kaifeng]], it was dismantled by the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin army]] and sent to the capital of [[Fanyang|Yanjing]] (now [[Beijing]]), where they were unable to put it back together.

The clock towers built by Zhang Sixun and Su Song, in the 10th and 11th centuries, respectively, also incorporated a [[striking clock]] mechanism, the use of clock jacks to sound the hours.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 165"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;  A striking clock outside of China was the [[Jayrun Water Clock]], at the [[Umayyad Mosque]] in [[Damascus]], [[Syria]], which struck once every hour.

[[Clock tower]]s in [[Western Europe]] in the Middle Ages were also sometimes [[striking clock]]s.

In 1497, Simone Campanato moulded the great bell on which every definite time-lapse is beaten by two mechanical bronze statues (h. 2,60 m.) called ''Due Mori'' (''Two [[Moors]]''), handling a hammer. Possibly earlier (1490) is the [[Prague Astronomical Clock]] by clockmaster Jan Růže (also called Hanuš) – according to another source this device was assembled as early as 1410 by clockmaker [[Mikuláš of Kadaň]] and mathematician [[Jan Šindel]].

The religious necessities and technical skill of the medieval monks were crucial factors in the development of clocks, as the historian [[Thomas Woods]] writes:
{{quote|text=The monks also counted skillful clock-makers among them. The first recorded clock was built by the future [[Pope Sylvester II]] for the German town of [[Magdeburg]], around the year 996.

[[Salisbury cathedral clock]], dating from about 1386, is one of the oldest working clocks in the world, and may be the oldest.  It still has most of its original parts,&lt;ref name="Salisbury"&gt;{{cite web| title= Oldest Working Clock, Frequently Asked Questions, Salisbury Cathedral|url= http://www.salisburycathedral.org.uk/visitor.faqs.php?id=23|accessdate= 4 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; although its original [[verge and foliot]] timekeeping mechanism is lost, having been converted to a [[pendulum]], which was replaced by a replica verge in 1956.

The framework is held together with metal dowels and pegs.  Two large stones, hanging from pulleys, supply the power. As the weights fall, ropes unwind from the wooden barrels. One barrel drives the main wheel, which is regulated by the escapement, and the other drives the striking mechanism and the air brake.&lt;ref name="Salisbury"/&gt;

During the Middle Ages, clocks primarily served religious purposes; the first employed for secular timekeeping emerged around the 15th century. In [[Dublin]], the official measurement of time became a local custom, and by 1466 a public clock stood on top of the [[Tholsel]] (the city court and council chamber).&lt;ref name="Dublin60"&gt;Clarke, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first of its kind to be clearly recorded in Ireland, and would only have had an hour hand.&lt;ref name="Dublin60"/&gt; The increasing lavishness of castles led to the introduction of turret clocks.&lt;ref name="Bottomley34"&gt;Bottomley, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; A 1435 example survives from [[Leeds castle]]; its face is decorated with the images of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]], [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[St George]].&lt;ref name="Bottomley34"/&gt;

Early clock dials showed hours: the display of minutes and seconds evolved later.

====Wristwatch====
{{Main article|Wristwatch|history of watches}}
[[File:Leicester as Governor-General engraving by Goltzius.jpg|thumb|upright|right|One of the earliest references to a wristwatch – an 'arm watch' given to Queen [[Elizabeth I]] by her favourite [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]].]]
The concept of the wristwatch goes back to the production of the very earliest watches in the 16th century. [[Elizabeth I]] of England received a wristwatch from [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]] in 1571, described as an arm watch. From the beginning, wrist watches were almost exclusively worn by women, while men used pocket-watches up until the early 20th century. This was not just a matter of fashion or prejudice; watches of the time were notoriously prone to fouling from exposure to the elements, and could only reliably be kept safe from harm if carried securely in the pocket. When the [[waistcoat]] was introduced as a manly fashion at the court of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in the 17th century, the pocket watch was tucked into its pocket. [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert]], the consort to [[Queen Victoria]], introduced the 'Albert chain' accessory, designed to secure the pocket watch to the man's outergarment by way of a clip. By the mid nineteenth century, most watchmakers produced a range of wristwatches, often marketed as [[bracelet]]s, for women.&lt;ref name="Evolu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagewatchstraps.com/wristwatches.html|title=THe Evolution of the Wristwatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wristwatches were first worn by military men towards the end of the nineteenth century, when the importance of synchronizing manoeuvres during war without potentially revealing the plan to the enemy through signalling was increasingly recognized. It was clear that using pocket watches while in the heat of battle or while mounted on a horse was impractical, so officers began to strap the watches to their wrist. The Garstin Company of [[London]] patented a 'Watch Wristlet' design in 1893, although they were probably producing similar designs from the 1880s. Clearly, a market for men's wristwatches was coming into being at the time. Officers in the [[British Army]] began using wristwatches during colonial military campaigns in the 1880s, such as during the [[Third Anglo-Burmese War|Anglo-Burma War]] of 1885.&lt;ref name="Evolu" /&gt;

During the [[Boer War]], the importance of coordinating troop movements and synchronizing attacks against the highly mobile Boer insurgents was paramount, and the use of wristwatches subsequently became widespread among the officer class. The company [[Mappin &amp; Webb]] began production of their successful 'campaign watch' for soldiers during the [[Battle of Omdurman|campaign at the Sudan in 1898]] and ramped up production for the Boer War a few years later.&lt;ref name="Evolu" /&gt;

[[File:First Battle of Passchendaele - barrage map (colour balance).jpg|thumb|right|Planning map for an Allied creeping barrage at [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]] – a tactic that required precise synchronisation between the artillery and infantry.]]
These early models were essentially standard pocket-watches fitted to a leather strap, but by the early 20th century, manufacturers began producing purpose-built wristwatches. The Swiss company, Dimier Frères &amp; Cie patented a wristwatch design with the now standard wire lugs in 1903. In 1904, [[Alberto Santos-Dumont]], an early aviator, asked his friend, a French [[watchmaker]] called [[Louis Cartier]], to design a watch that could be useful during his flights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lego Mindstorms NXT Hacker's Guide|last=Prochnow|first=Dave|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2006|isbn=0-07-148147-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

in 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilsdorf was an early convert to the wristwatch, and contracted the Swiss firm Aegler to produce a line of wristwatches. His Rolex wristwatch of 1910 became the first such watch to receive certification as a chronometer in Switzerland and it went on to win an award in 1914 from [[Kew Observatory]] in [[Richmond, Surrey|Richmond]], west London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qualitytyme.net/pages/rolex_articles/history_of_wristwatch.html|title=The History and Evolution of the Wristwatch.|author=John E. Brozek|publisher=International Watch Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of the [[First World War]] dramatically shifted public perceptions on the propriety of the man's wristwatch, and opened up a mass market in the post-war era. The [[creeping barrage]] artillery tactic, developed during the War, required precise synchronization between the artillery gunners and the infantry advancing behind the barrage. Service watches produced during the War were specially designed for the rigours of [[trench warfare]], with luminous dials and unbreakable glass. Wristwatches were also found to be needed in the air as much as on the ground: military pilots found them more convenient than pocket watches for the same reasons as Santos-Dumont had. The British [[War Office|War Department]] began issuing wristwatches to combatants from 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hoffman|first=Paul|title=Wings of Madness: Alberto Santos-Dumont and the Invention of Flight|publisher=Hyperion Press|year=2004|isbn=0-7868-8571-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cortjump1.jpg|thumb|A ''Cortébert'' wristwatch from the 1920s.|left]]
The company H. Williamson Ltd., based in [[Coventry]], was one of the first to capitalize on this opportunity. During the company's 1916 [[Annual general meeting|AGM]] it was noted that "...the public is buying the practical things of life. Nobody can truthfully contend that the watch is a luxury. It is said that one soldier in every four wears a wristlet watch, and the other three mean to get one as soon as they can." By the end of the War, almost all enlisted men wore a wristwatch, and after they were demobilized, the fashion soon caught on – the British ''[[British Horological Institute|Horological Journal]]'' wrote in 1917 that "...the wristlet watch was little used by the sterner sex before the war, but now is seen on the wrist of nearly every man in uniform and of many men in civilian attire." Within a decade, sales of wristwatches had outstripped those of pocket watches.&lt;ref name="Evolu" /&gt;

====Equation clock====
{{Main|Equation clock}}
In the late 17th and 18th Centuries, [[equation clock]]s were made, which allowed the user to see or calculate apparent [[solar time]], as would be shown by a [[sundial]]. Before the invention of the pendulum clock, sundials were the only accurate timepieces. When good clocks became available, they appeared inaccurate to people who were used to trusting sundials. The annual variation of the [[equation of time]] made a clock up to about 15 minutes fast or slow, relative to a sundial, depending on the time of year. Equation clocks satisfied the demand for clocks that always agreed with sundials. Several types of equation clock mechanism were devised. which can be seen in surviving examples, mostly in museums.

==Era of precision timekeeping==

H. |quote=As William J. H. Andrewes (2006) notes: "In the 16th century Danish astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]] and his contemporaries tried to use clocks for scientific purposes, yet even the best ones were still too unreliable. Astronomers in particular needed a better tool for timing the transit of stars and thereby creating more accurate maps of the heavens. The pendulum proved to be the key to boosting the accuracy and dependability of timekeepers. [[Galileo Galilei]], the Italian physicist and astronomer, and others before him experimented with pendulums, but a young Dutch astronomer and mathematician named Christiaan Huygens devised the first pendulum clock on Christmas Day in 1656. (...) Pendulum clocks were about 100 times as accurate as their predecessors, reducing a typical gain or loss of 15 minutes a day to about a minute a week. News of the invention spread rapidly, and by 1660 English and French artisans were developing their own versions of this new timekeeper. &lt;br/&gt; In 1675 Huygens devised his next major improvement, the spiral balance spring. (...) The spiral balance spring revolutionized the accuracy of watches, enabling them to keep time to within a minute a day. This advance sparked an almost immediate rise in the market for watches, which were now no longer typically worn on a chain around the neck but were carried in a pocket, a wholly new fashion in clothing." |date=1 February 2006 |accessdate=1 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was "the most ingenious watchmaker of all time" (in [[Arnold Sommerfeld]]'s own words).&lt;ref&gt;Gindikin, Simon; Shuchat, Alan (2007).

Innovations to the mechanical clock continued, with miniaturization leading to domestic clocks in the 15th century, and personal watches in the 16th.&lt;ref name="Davies434"/&gt; In the 1580s, the Italian [[polymath]] [[Galileo Galilei]] investigated the regular swing of the [[pendulum]], and discovered that it could be used to regulate a clock.&lt;ref name=nistrevolution/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pockets"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Davies |first=Eryl |title=Pockets: Inventions |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |location=London |year=1995 |isbn=0-7513-5184-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Galileo studied the pendulum as early as 1582, he never actually constructed a clock based on that design.&lt;ref name=nistrevolution/&gt; The first pendulum clock was designed and built by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]], in 1656.&lt;ref name=nistrevolution/&gt; Early versions erred by less than one minute per day, and later ones only by 10&amp;nbsp;seconds, very accurate for their time.&lt;ref name=nistrevolution/&gt;

In [[England]], the manufacturing of pendulum clocks was soon taken up.&lt;ref name="histworld"/&gt; The [[longcase clock]] (also known as the [[grandfather clock]]) was first created to house the pendulum and works by the English clockmaker William Clement in 1670 or 1671; this became feasible after Clement invented the [[anchor escapement]] mechanism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa072801a.htm |title=The History of Mechanical Pendulum Clocks and Quartz Clocks |work=about.com |year=2012 |accessdate=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in about 1670.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Short History of Technology: From the Earliest Times to A.D. 1900|last=Derry|first=T.

To avoid the need for a very large case, most clocks using the verge escapement had a short pendulum. The anchor mechanism, however, reduced the pendulum's necessary swing to between 4° to 6°, allowing clockmakers to use longer pendulums with consequently slower beats. These required less power to move, caused less friction and wear, and were more accurate than their shorter predecessors. Most longcase clocks use a pendulum about a metre (39&amp;nbsp;inches) long to the center of the bob, with each swing taking one second. This requirement for height, along with the need for a long drop space for the weights that power the clock, gave rise to the tall, narrow case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brain|first=Marshall|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/clock.htm|title=How Pendulum Clocks Work|publisher=[[HowStuffWorks]] |accessdate=10 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clement also introduced the pendulum suspension spring in 1671. The concentric minute hand was added to the clock by [[Daniel Quare]], a London clock-maker, and the Second Hand was introduced.

The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] were another major contributor to the development of pendulum clocks in the 17th and 18th centuries, having had an "unusually keen appreciation of the importance of precision".&lt;ref name="Woods100"&gt;Woods, pp. 100–101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Woods103"&gt;Woods, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; In measuring an accurate one-second pendulum, for example, the Italian astronomer Father [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]] persuaded nine fellow Jesuits "to count nearly 87,000 oscillations in a single day".&lt;ref name="Woods103"/&gt; They served a crucial role in spreading and testing the scientific ideas of the period, and collaborated with contemporary scientists, such as Huygens.&lt;ref name="Woods100"/&gt;

[[File:Russian finished watch movement.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A [[mechanical watch]] [[Movement (clockwork)|movement]]. From its invention in 1675 by Huygens, the spiral [[hairspring]] ([[balance spring]]) system for portable timekeepers, is still used in [[mechanical watch]]making industry today. Like pendulum clocks, [[balance spring|spiral-hairspring]] [[watch]]es were early precision timekeeping devices.]]

The invention of the [[mainspring]] in the early 15th century allowed portable clocks to be built, evolving into the first [[pocketwatch]]es by the 17th century, but these were not very accurate until the [[balance spring]] was added to the [[balance wheel]] in the mid 17th century. Some dispute remains as to whether British scientist [[Robert Hooke]] (his was a straight spring) or Dutch scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]] was the actual inventor of the [[balance spring]]. Huygens was clearly the first to use a spiral balance spring, the form used in virtually all watches to the present day.  The addition of the balance spring made the balance wheel a [[harmonic oscillator]] like the pendulum in a pendulum clock, which oscillated at a fixed [[resonant frequency]] and resisted oscillating at other rates.  This innovation increased watches' accuracy enormously, reducing error from perhaps several hours per day to perhaps 10 minutes per day,&lt;ref name="nistrevolution"/&gt; resulting in the addition of the [[Clock face|minute hand]] to the watch face around 1680 in Britain and 1700 in France&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://atena.beic.it/webclient/DeliveryManager?pid=13458392&amp;search_terms=DTL59|title=Acta Eruditorum|last=|first=|publisher=|year=1737|isbn=|location=Leipzig|pages=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Like the invention of [[pendulum clock]], Huygens' spiral [[hairspring]] ([[balance spring]]) system of portable timekeepers, helped lay the foundations for the modern [[watchmaking]] industry.

===Pocket watch===

In 1675, Huygens and [[Robert Hooke]] invented the [[spiral balance]], or the hairspring, designed to control the oscillating speed of the [[balance wheel]]. This crucial advance finally made accurate [[pocket watch]]es possible.&lt;ref name="Pockets"/&gt;  This resulted in a great advance in accuracy of pocket watches, from perhaps several hours per day to 10&amp;nbsp;minutes per day, similar to the effect of the pendulum upon mechanical clocks.&lt;ref name="NIST" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Milham | first= Willis I. | title=Time and Timekeepers | year=1945 | publisher=MacMillan | location=New York | isbn=0-7808-0008-7|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; The great English clockmaker, [[Thomas Tompion]], was one of the first to use this mechanism successfully in his pocket watches, and he adopted the minute hand which, after a variety of designs were trialled, eventually stabilised into the modern-day configuration.&lt;ref name="histworld"&gt;{{cite web|title=HISTORY OF CLOCKS|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?groupid=2324&amp;HistoryID=ac08&amp;gtrack=pthc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rev. [[Edward Barlow (priest)|Edward Barlow]] invented the rack and snail striking mechanism for [[striking clock]]s, which was a great improvement over the previous mechanism. The [[repeater (horology)|repeating clock]], that chimes the number of hours (or even minutes) was invented by either Quare or Barlow in 1676. [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] invented the [[Escapement#Deadbeat escapement|deadbeat escapement]] for clocks in 1720.

===Marine chronometer===
{{Main|Marine chronometer}}
[[File:Harrison H4 clock in The principles of Mr Harrison's time-keeper 1767.jpg|thumb|left|Drawings of [[John Harrison|Harrison]]'s H4 [[Marine chronometer|chronometer]] of 1761, published in ''The principles of Mr Harrison's time-keeper'', 1767.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=aB8OAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover The principles of Mr Harrison's time-keeper]''&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Marine chronometer]]s are clocks used at sea as [[time standard]]s, to determine [[longitude]] by [[celestial navigation]].&lt;ref name=marinechrono/&gt;
A major stimulus to improving the accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The position of a ship at sea could be determined with reasonable accuracy if a navigator could refer to a clock that lost or gained less than about 10 seconds per day. The marine chronometer would have to keep the time of a fixed location—usually [[Greenwich Mean Time]]—allowing seafarers to determine longitude by comparing the local high noon to the clock.&lt;ref name=marinechrono&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nawcc.org/museum/nwcm/galleries/marine/marine.htm |title=Marine Chronometers Gallery |accessdate=20 May 2008 |publisher=[[National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=manitoba&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manitobamuseum.ca/sg_marine.html |title=Science News – The Marine Chronometer |accessdate=20 May 2008 |first=Jérôme |last=Marchildon |publisher=[[Manitoba Museum]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919035618/http://www.manitobamuseum.ca/sg_marine.html|archivedate=September 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=longitudeprize&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/explore/index.cfm/category/chronometers |title=Chronometers, precision watches, and timekeepers |publisher=[[National Maritime Museum]] |location=[[Greenwich]] |accessdate=20 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029165741/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/explore/index.cfm/category/chronometers |archivedate=October 29, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This clock could not contain a pendulum, which would be virtually useless on a rocking ship.

[[Image:MIH-film12 color cerrected denoise.jpg|thumb|right|A twin-barrel box chronometer.]]
After the [[Scilly naval disaster of 1707]] where four ships ran aground due to navigational mistakes, the British government offered a large [[longitude prize|prize]] of £20,000, equivalent to millions of pounds today, for anyone who could determine longitude accurately. The reward was eventually claimed in 1761 by [[Yorkshire]] carpenter [[John Harrison]], who dedicated his life to improving the accuracy of his clocks.

In 1735 Harrison built his first chronometer, which he steadily improved on over the next thirty years before submitting it for examination. The clock had many innovations, including the use of bearings to reduce friction, weighted balances to compensate for the ship's pitch and roll in the sea and the use of two different metals to reduce the problem of expansion from heat.

The chronometer was trialled in 1761 by Harrison's son and by the end of 10 weeks the clock was in error by less than 5 seconds.&lt;ref name=gould&gt;{{cite book|author=Gould, Rupert T.|authorlink=Rupert Gould|title=The Marine Chronometer.

[[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]], a Scottish clock and instrument maker, was the first to invent and patent the [[electric clock]] in 1840. On January 11, 1841, Alexander Bain along with John Barwise, a chronometer maker, took out another important patent describing a clock in which an [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] [[pendulum]] and an [[electric current]] is employed to keep the clock going instead of springs or weights. Later patents expanded on his original ideas.

===Atomic clock===
{{Main article|Atomic clock}}
Atomic clocks are the most accurate timekeeping devices in practical use today. Accurate to within a few seconds over many thousands of years, they are used to calibrate other clocks and timekeeping instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DNwfG5hQ7-YC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PRA1-PA484,M1|title=Sky and Ocean Joined: The U.S. Naval Observatory, 1830–2000|last=Dick|first=Stephen|page=484|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-81599-1|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first accurate atomic clock, a [[caesium standard]] based on a certain transition of the [[caesium-133]] atom, was built by [[Louis Essen]] in 1955 at the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]] in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;

==Clock and watch-making industry==
{{Main article|Clockmaking|Watchmaking}}
[[Image:MontreGousset001.jpg|thumb|A [[pocket watch]]]]
The first professional clockmakers came from the [[guild]]s of [[locksmith]]s and [[jeweller]]s. Clockmaking developed from a specialized craft into a mass production industry over many years.&lt;ref name="Davies435" /&gt;

[[Paris]] and [[Blois]] were the early centres of clockmaking in France. French clockmakers such as [[Julien Le Roy]], clockmaker of [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]], were leaders in case design and ornamental clocks.&lt;ref name="Davies435"&gt;Davies, Norman; p. 435&lt;/ref&gt; Le Roy belonged to the fifth generation of a family of clockmakers, and was described by his contemporaries as "the most skillful clockmaker in France, possibly in Europe". He invented a special repeating mechanism which improved the precision of clocks and watches, a face that could be opened to view the inside clockwork, and made or supervised over 3,500&amp;nbsp;watches. The competition and scientific rivalry resulting from his discoveries further encouraged researchers to seek new methods of measuring time more accurately.&lt;ref name="Leroy"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Getty Center]]|url=http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artMakerDetails?maker=556 |title=Julien Le Roy |accessdate=5 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1794 and 1795, in the aftermath of the [[French Revolution]], the French government briefly mandated [[decimal time|decimal clocks]], with a day divided into 10&amp;nbsp;hours of 100&amp;nbsp;minutes each.&lt;ref name="Alder"&gt;Alder, pp. 149–150&lt;/ref&gt; The astronomer and mathematician [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], among other individuals, modified the dial of his pocket watch to decimal time.&lt;ref name="Alder"/&gt; A clock in the [[Palais des Tuileries]] kept decimal time as late as 1801, but the cost of replacing all the nation's clocks prevented decimal clocks from becoming widespread.&lt;ref name="Alder162"&gt;Alder, pp. 150–162&lt;/ref&gt; Because decimalized clocks only helped astronomers rather than ordinary citizens, it was one of the most unpopular changes associated with the [[metric system]], and it was abandoned.&lt;ref name="Alder162"/&gt;

In Germany, [[Nuremberg]] and [[Augsburg]] were the early clockmaking centers, and the [[Black Forest]] came to specialize in wooden [[cuckoo clocks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Victorian Antiques|last=Shull|first=Thelma|publisher=C. E. Tuttle Co.|year=1963|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pocketwatch movement.png|thumb|left|220px|An antique pocket watch movement, from an 1891 encyclopedia.]]
The English became the predominant clockmakers of the 17th and 18th centuries. The main centres of the British industry were in the [[City of London]], the [[West End of London]], [[Soho]] where many skilled French [[Huguenot]]s settled and later in [[Clerkenwell]]. The [[Worshipful Company of Clockmakers]] was established in 1631 as one of the [[Livery Companies]] of the City of London.

[[Thomas Tompion]] was the first English clockmaker with an international reputation and many of his pupils went on to become great horologists in their own right, such as [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] who invented the deadbeat escapement, orrery and mercury [[pendulum]], and his pupil [[Thomas Mudge (horologist)|Thomas Mudge]] who created the first [[lever escapement]]. Famous clockmakers of this period included [[Joseph Windmills]], Simon de Charmes who established the De Charmes clockmaker firm and [[Christopher Pinchbeck]] who invented the alloy [[Pinchbeck (alloy)|pinchbeck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22169|title=Clock and Watch-Making|publisher=British History Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later famous horologists included [[John Arnold (watchmaker)|John Arnold]] who made the first practical and accurate modern watch by refining Harrison's chronometer, [[Thomas Earnshaw]] who was the first to make these available to the public, [[Daniel Quare]], who invented a repeating watch movement, a portable barometer and introduced the concentric minute hand.

Quality control and standards were imposed on clockmakers by the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers, a guild which licensed clockmakers for doing business. By the rise of [[consumerism]] in the late 18th century, clocks, especially pocket watches, became regarded as fashion accessories and were made in increasingly decorative styles. By 1796, the industry reached a high point with almost 200,000 clocks being produced annually in London, however by the mid-19th century the industry had gone into steep decline from Swiss competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=England: Where watchmaking all began|url=http://www.watchpro.com/england-where-watchmaking-all-began/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Switzerland established itself as a clockmaking center following the influx of [[Huguenot]] craftsmen, and in the 19th century, the Swiss industry "gained worldwide supremacy in high-quality machine-made watches". The leading firm of the day was [[Patek Philippe]], founded by [[Antoni Patek]] of [[Warsaw]] and [[Adrien Philippe]] of [[Bern]].&lt;ref name="Davies435"/&gt;

The '''hype cycle''' is a branded graphical presentation developed and used by the American research, advisory and [[information technology]] firm [[Gartner]], for representing the maturity, adoption and social application of specific [[Technology|technologies]]. The hype cycle provides a graphical and conceptual presentation of the maturity of emerging technologies through five phases.

An example of a hype cycle is found in ''Amara's law''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://spotlessdata.com/blog/amaras-law|title=Amara's Law|publisher=|accessdate=April 26, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180410135130/https://spotlessdata.com/blog/amaras-law|archive-date=April 10, 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; coined by [[Roy Amara]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neatorama.com/2012/09/05/Four-Geeky-Laws-That-Rule-Our-World/ |title=Four Geeky Laws That Rule Our World |first1=Alex |last1=Santoso |date=September 5, 2012|publisher=Neatorama |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which states that &lt;blockquote&gt;We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.&lt;ref name=PC_Mag&gt;{{cite journal|title=Encyclopedia: Definition of: Amara's law|journal=PC Magazine|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/37701/amara-s-law|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isen.com/archives/011126.html|title=isen.com: Amara's Law -- SMART Letter #63|publisher=|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Five phases==
[[File:Hype-Cycle-General.png|thumb|right|320px|General hype cycle for technology]]

Each hype cycle drills down into the five key phases of a technology's life cycle.

{|class="wikitable"
!align=center|No.
!align=center width=180px|Phase
!align=center|Description
|-
!align=center|1
|Technology Trigger
|A potential technology breakthrough kicks things off. Early proof-of-concept stories and media interest trigger significant publicity. Often no usable products exist and commercial viability is unproven.
|-
!align=center|2
|Peak of Inflated Expectations
|Early publicity produces a number of success stories—often accompanied by scores of failures. Some companies take action; most don't.
|-
!align=center|3
|Trough of Disillusionment
|Interest wanes as experiments and implementations fail to deliver. Producers of the technology shake out or fail. Investment continues only if the surviving providers improve their products to the satisfaction of early adopters.
|-
!align=center|4
|Slope of Enlightenment
|More instances of how the technology can benefit the enterprise start to crystallize and become more widely understood. Second- and third-generation products appear from technology providers. More enterprises fund pilots; conservative companies remain cautious.
|-
!align=center|5
|Plateau of Productivity
|Mainstream adoption starts to take off. Criteria for assessing provider viability are more clearly defined. The technology's broad market applicability and relevance are clearly paying off. If the technology has more than a niche market then it will continue to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital marketing|last=1963-|first=Chaffey, Dave|publisher=Pearson|others=Ellis-Chadwick, Fiona|year=2016|isbn=9781292077611|edition= Sixth |location=Harlow|pages=140–141|oclc=942844494}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|}
The term "hype cycle" and each of the associated phases are now used more broadly in the [[marketing]] of new technologies.

==Hype in new media==
Hype (in the more general media sense of the term "hype"&lt;ref name=Flew_Newmedia /&gt;) plays a large part in the adoption of [[new media]] forms by society. [[Terry Flew]] states{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} that hype (generally the enthusiastic and strong feeling around new forms of media and technology in which people expect everything will be modified for the better{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}) surrounding [[new media]] technologies and their popularization, along with the development of the Internet, is a common characteristic. But following shortly after the period of 'inflated expectations', as per the diagram above, the new media technologies quickly fall into a period of disenchantment, which is the end of the primary, and strongest, phase of hype.

Many analyses of the Internet in the 1990s featured large amounts of hype,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last=Dyson |first=Esther |title=Release 2.0: A Design For Living In The Digital Age |publisher=Broadway Books |location=New York |year=1997 |edition= 1st}}
&lt;/ref&gt; which created "debunking" responses.&lt;ref name=Flew_Newmedia&gt;{{cite book |last=Flew |first=Terry |title=New Media: An Introduction |publisher=OUP Australia and New Zealand |location=South Melbourne |year=2008 |edition= 3rd |isbn=978-0-19-555149-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such hype and the negative and positive responses toward it have given way to research that looks empirically at new media and its impact.

A longer-term historical perspective on such cycles can be found in the research of the economist [[Carlota Perez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Henton|first=Doug|last2=Held|first2=Kim|date=2013|title=The dynamics of Silicon Valley: Creative destruction and the evolution of the innovation habitat|journal=Social Science Information|language=en|volume=52|issue=4|pages=539–557|doi=10.1177/0539018413497542|issn=0539-0184}}&lt;/ref&gt; D R Laurence in clinical pharmacology described a similar process in drug development in the seventies.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Criticisms==

Another is that it is limited in its application, as it prioritizes economic considerations in decision-making processes. It seems to assume that a business' performance is tied to the hype cycle, whereas this may actually have more to do with the way a company devises its branding strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rootbranded.com/mindshift-magazine/branding-strategy-cut-hype-cycles|title=RootBranded {{!}} Mindshift Magazine|website=RootBranded {{!}} Saving Great Ideas from Obscurity|language=en|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related criticism is that the "cycle" has no real benefits to the development or marketing of new technologies and merely comments on pre-existing trends. Specific disadvantages when compared to, for example, [[technology readiness level]] are:
* The cycle is not scientific in nature, and there is no data or analysis that would justify the cycle.
* With the (subjective) terms ''disillusionment'', ''enlightenment'' and ''expectations'' it can not be described objectively or clearly where technology now really is.
* The terms are misleading in the sense that one gets the wrong idea what he or she can use a technology for. The user does not want to be disappointed, so should he or she stay away from technology in the Trough of Disillusionment?
* No action perspective is offered to move technology to a next phase.
* This appears to be a very simplified impulse response of an elastic system representable by a differential equation.  Perhaps more telling would be to formulate a system model with solutions conforming to observable behavior.
An analysis of Gartner Hype Cycles since 2000&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; shows that few technologies actually travel through an identifiable hype cycle, and that in practice most of the important technologies adopted since 2000 were not identified early in their adoption cycles.

'''IMS VDEX''', which stands for '''IMS Vocabulary Definition Exchange''', is a mark-up language – or grammar – for [[Controlled vocabulary|controlled vocabularies]] developed by IMS Global as an open specification, with the Final Specification being approved in February 2004.

IMS VDEX allows the exchange and expression of simple machine-readable lists of human language terms, along with information that may assist a human in understanding the meaning of the various terms, i.e. a flat list of values, a hierarchical tree of values, a thesaurus, a taxonomy, a glossary or a dictionary.

Structural a vocabulary has an identifier, title and a list of terms. Each term has a unique key, titles and (optional) descriptions. A term may have nested terms, thus a hierarchical structure can be created. It is possible to define relationships between terms and add custom metadata to terms.

IMS VDEX support multilinguality. All values supposed to be read by a human, i.e. titles, can be defined in one or more languages.

== Purposes ==
VDEX was designed to supplement other IMS specifications and the IEEE LOM standard by giving additional semantic control to tool developers. IMS VDEX could be used for the following purposes. It is used in practice for other purposes as well.

* ''Interfaces providing pre-defined choices'' – providing radio buttons and drop-down menus for interfaces such as metadata editors or a repository browse tool, based on the vocabulary allowed in the metadata profile used
* ''Distributing vocabularies among many users'' – achieved by simple XML file sharing, or possibly a searchable [[Repository Open Service Interface Definition|repository]] or registry of vocabularies
* ''XML stylesheets used to select and generate different views'' – selecting an overview of an entire vocabulary as an [[HTML]] or [[PDF]] file, for example; providing scope notes for catalogues; or storing a glossary of terms which are called upon by hyperlinks within a document
* ''Validation of metadata instances'' – validated against an application profile, by comparison of the vocabulary terms used in certain metadata elements with those of the machine readable version of the vocabularies specified by the application profile.
* ''Controlled terms for other IMS specifications and IEEE LOM'' – both may contain elements where controlled terms should be used. These elements are often specified as being of a vocabulary data type, and a definition of the permitted terms and their usage may be expressed using VDEX.

== Technical details ==
[[Image:VDEX model.PNG|350px|right|thumb|simplified VDEX data model]]
The VDEX Information Model is represented in the diagram. A VDEX file describing a vocabulary comprises a number of information elements, most of which are relatively simple, such as a string representation of the default (human) language or a [[URI]] identifying the value domain (or vocabulary). Some of the elements are ‘containers’ – such as a ''term'' – that contain additional elements.

Elements may be required or optional, and in some cases, repeatable. Within a term, for example, a ''description'' and ''caption'' may be defined. Multiple language definitions can be used inside a description, by using a ''langstring'' element, where the description is paired with the language to be used. Additional elements within a term include ''media descriptors'', which are one or more media files to supplement a term’s description; and ''metadata'', which is used to describe the vocabulary further.

The ''relationship'' container defines a relationship between terms by identifying the two terms and the specifying type or relationship, such as a term being broader or narrower than another. The term used to specify the type of relationship may conform to the ISO standards for thesauri.

''Vocabulary identifiers'' are unique, persistent URIs, whereas term or relationship identifiers are locally unique strings. VDEX also allows for a ''default language'' and ''vocabulary name'' to be given, and for whether the ordering of terms within the vocabulary is significant (''order significance'') to be specified.

A ''profile type'' is specified to describe the type of vocabulary being expressed; different features of the VDEX model are permitted depending on the profile type, providing a common grammar for several classes of vocabulary. For example, it is possible, in some profile types, for terms to be contained within one another and be nested, which is suited to the expression of hierarchical vocabularies. Five profile types exist: ''lax'', ''thesaurus'', ''hierarchicalTokenTerms'', ‘glossaryOrDictionary’ and ''flatTokenTerms''. The lax profile is the least restrictive and offers the full VDEX model, whereas the flatTokenTerms profile is the most restrictive and lightweight.

VDEX also offers some scope for complex vocabularies, assuming the existence of a well-defined application profile (for exchange interoperability). Some examples are:
* ''Faceted schemes'' – faceted vocabularies are possible with the definition of appropriate relationships
* ''Multi-lingual thesauri'' – metadata could be used within a relationship to achieve multilingual thesauri
* ''Polyhierarchical taxonomies'' – can be expressed using the source/target value pairs in the relationship.

Identifiers in VDEX data should be persistent, unique, resolvable, transportable and URI-compliant. Specifically, vocabulary identifiers should be unique URIs, whereas term and relationship identifiers should be locally unique strings.

== Implementations ==
* [http://aloha2.netera.ca/ ALOHA Metadata Tagging Tool] — Java-based software project that can read IMS VDEX files.
* [http://www.ivimeds.org/news/demonstrator.html IVIMEDS 1G v1.0] – from The International Virtual Medical School – includes VDEX instances in curriculum maps. Partners can create their own maps in VDEX format and use these to help students search the repository.
* [http://www.elframework.org/projects/spws/view Skills Profiling Web Service] — project implemented and demonstrated use of a skills profiling web service using open standards in a medical context. IMS VDEX files were used in the representation of the SPWS hierarchy skills framework.
* [http://www.scottishdoctor.org/ Scottish Doctors] — project used VDEX as a format for expressing curricular outcome systems.
* [http://prs.heacademy.ac.uk/technical/vdex_scripts.html VDEX XSLT scripts] — developed by The Higher Education Academy Centre for Philosophical and Religious Studies to convert VDEX to XHTML and PostgreSQL .
* [http://www.icbl.hw.ac.uk/vdex VDEX Implementation Project] — carried out by the Institute for Computer-Based Learning at Heriot–Watt University, with a primary objective of creating a tool for editing vocabularies in VDEX format. The project, which ended in January 2004, was based on the Public Draft (not the current Final Specification).
* [http://sourceforge.net/projects/vdex-j/ VDEX Java Binding] — implementation neutral Java interface for VDEX, as well as providing a default implementation of that interface, and XML marshalling functionality.

In ordinary computer programming, the programmer keeps the program's intended results in mind and painstakingly constructs a computer program to achieve those results. '''Inferential programming''' refers to (still mostly hypothetical) techniques and technologies enabling the inverse. Inferential programming would allow the programmer to describe the intended result to the computer using a metaphor such as a [[fitness function]], a test specification, or a logical specification and then the computer would construct its own program to meet the supplied criteria.

During the 1980s, approaches to achieve inferential programming mostly revolved around techniques for logical [[inference]]. Today the term is sometimes used in connection with [[evolutionary computation]] techniques that enable the computer to evolve a solution in response to a problem posed as a fitness or reward function.

'''Michell structures''' are structures that are optimal based on the criteria defined by [[Anthony Michell|A.G.M. Michell]] in his seminal 1904 paper.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Michell|Michell, A. G. M.]] (1904) ''The limits of economy of material in frame-structures'', Philosophical Magazine, Vol. 8(47), p. 589-597.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Michell|Michell]] states that ''“a frame (today called truss) (is optimal) attains the limit of economy of material possible in any frame-structure under the same applied forces, if the space occupied by it can be subjected to an appropriate small deformation, such that the strains in all the bars of the frame are increased by equal fractions of their lengths, not less than the fractional change of length of any element of the space.”''

The above conclusion is based on the Maxwell load-path theorem:

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{} l_p f_p - \sum_{} l_q f_q = C&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;f_p&lt;/math&gt; is the tension value in any tension element of length &lt;math&gt;l_p&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f_q&lt;/math&gt; is the compression value in any compression element of length &lt;math&gt;l_q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a constant value which is based on external loads applied to the structure.

Based on the Maxwell load-path theorem, reducing load path of tension members &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{} l_p f_p&lt;/math&gt; will reduce by the same value the load path of compression elements&lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{} l_q f_q&lt;/math&gt;  for a given set of external loads. Structure with minimum load path is one having minimum compliance [[Topology_optimization#Structural_compliance|compliance]] (having minimum weighted deflection in the points of applied loads weighted by the values of these loads). In consequence Michell structures are minimum compliance trusses.

==Special cases==

'''1. All bars of a truss are subject to a load of the same sign (tension or compression).'''

Required volume of material is the same for all possible cases for a given set of loads. Michell defines minimum required volume of material to be:
&lt;math display="inline"&gt; V_m=\frac{\sum_{} l f}{P}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the allowable stress in the material.

'''2. Mixed tension and compression bars'''

More general case are frames which consist of bars that both before and after the appropriate deformation, form curves of orthogonal systems. A two-dimensional orthogonal system remains orthogonal after stretching one series of curves and compressing the other with equal strain if and only if the inclination between any two adjacent curves of the same series is constant throughout their length. This requirement results with the perpendicular series of cures to be either:

a) systems of tangents and [[involute]]s or

b) systems of intersecting [[logarithmic spiral]]s.

Note that straight line or a circle are special cases of a [[logarithmic spiral]].

==Examples==

Michell provided several examples of optimum frames:

==Prager trusses==
In recent years a lot of studies have been done on discrete optimum trusses.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Prager|Prager W.]], A Note on Discretized Michell Structures, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, Vol. 3, pp. 349-355, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William Prager|Prager W.]] Optimal layout of cantilever trusses, Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications (1977) 23: 111. https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00932301&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William Prager|Prager W.]] Nearly optimal design of trusses, Computers &amp; Structures, ISSN: 0045-7949, Vol: 8, Issue: 3, Page: 451-454, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of Michell trusses being defined for continuum (infinite number of members) these are sometimes called Michell trusses as well. Significant contribution to the topic of discrete optimum trusses had [[William Prager]] who used the method of the circle of relative displacements to arrive with optimal topology of such trusses (typically cantilevers). To recognize [[William Prager|Prager’s]] contribution discrete Michell trusses are sometimes called Prager trusses. Later geometry of cantilevered Prager trusses has been formalized by Mazurek, [[William F. Baker (engineer)|Baker]] and Tort &lt;ref&gt;Mazurek, A., [[William F. Baker (engineer)|Baker W.F.]]  &amp; Tort, C., Geometrical aspects of optimum truss like structures, Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization (2011) 43: 231. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00158-010-0559-x&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mazurek, A., Geometrical aspects of optimum truss like structures for three-force problem, Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization (2012) 45: 21. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00158-011-0679-y&lt;/ref&gt; who noticed certain geometrical relationships between members of optimal discrete trusses for 3 point or 3 force problems.

== History ==
The history of miniaturization is associated with the history of information technology based on the succession of switching devices, each smaller, faster, cheaper than its predecessor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nanostructuring Operations in Nanoscale Science and Engineering|last=Sharma|first=Karl|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies Inc.|year=2010|isbn=9780071626095|location=New York|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period referred to as the [[Second Industrial Revolution]], miniaturization was confined to two-dimensional electronic circuits used for the manipulation of information.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Micromechanisms and Microactuators|last=Ghosh|first=Amitabha|last2=Corves|first2=Burkhard|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=9788132221432|location=Heidelberg|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; This orientation is demonstrated in the use of vacuum tubes in the first general-purpose computers. The technology gave way to the transistor invented in the 1950s and then the integrated circuit approach developed afterward.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Gordon Moore described the development of miniaturization in 1975 during the International Electron Devices meeting, where he confirmed his earlier prediction that silicon integrated circuit would dominate electronics, underscoring that during the period such circuits were already high-performance devices and starting to become cheaper. This was made possible by a reliable manufacturing process, which involved the fabrication in a batch process. It employed [[Photolithography|photolithographic]], mechanical, and chemical processing steps to create multiple Cheetos are the best chips in the world   transistors on a single wafer of silicon.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Moore's Law: Four Decades of Innovation|last=Brock|first=David|last2=Moore|first2=Gordon|publisher=Chemical Heritage Press|year=2006|isbn=0941901416|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The measure of this process was its yield, which is the ratio of working devices to those with defects and, given a satisfactory yield, a smaller transistor means that more can be on a single wafer, making each one cheaper to produce.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  

== Development ==
Miniaturization became a trend in the last fifty years and came to cover not just electronic but also mechanical devices.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science in Popular Culture: A Reference Guide|last=Van Riper|first=A. Bowdoin|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2002|isbn=0313318220|location=Westport, CT|pages=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, electronic companies are producing silicon integrated circuits or chips with switching transistors that have feature size as small as 130 [[Nanometre|nanometers]] (nm) and development is also underway for chips that are merely few nanometers in size through the [[nanotechnology]] initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Futuristic Materials|last=Jha|first=B.B|last2=Galgali|first2=R.K.|last3=Misra|first3=Vibhuti|publisher=Allied Publishers|year=2004|isbn=8177646168|location=New Delhi|pages=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus is to make components smaller to increase the number that can be integrated into a single wafer and this required critical innovations, which include increasing wafer size, the development of sophisticated metal connections between the chip's circuits, and improvement in the [[Polymer|polymers]] used for masks ([[Photoresist|photoresists]]) in the [[photolithography]] processes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These last two are the areas where miniaturization has moved into the nanometer range.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  

Miniaturization in electronics is advancing rapidly due to the comparative ease in miniaturizing electrons, which are its principal moving parts. The process for mechanical devices, on the other hand, is more complex due to the way the structural properties of its parts change as they shrink.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is said that the so-called [[Digital Revolution|Third Industrial Revolution]] is based on economically viable technologies that can shrink three-dimensional objects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.jpg|right|thumb|Cape Canaveral Missile Row in 1964]]
'''Missile Row''' was a nickname given in the 1960s to the US Air Force and [[NASA]] launch complexes at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] (CCAFS). Operated by the [[45th Space Wing]] of the [[U.S. Air Force]] since 1949, it was the site of all pre-[[Apollo 8]] manned launches, as well as many other early [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD) and NASA launches. For the DoD, it plays a secondary role to [[Vandenberg AFB]] in [[California]], but is the launch site for many NASA unmanned [[space probe]]s, as those spacecraft are typically launched on [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] launchers. Active launch vehicles are in '''bold'''.

Much of the support activity for CCAFS occurs at [[Patrick Air Force Base]] to the south, its reporting base.

'''Mobile search''' is an evolving branch of information retrieval services that is centered on the [[convergence (telecommunications)|convergence]] of [[mobile operating system|mobile platforms]] and [[mobile phone]]s, or that it can be used to tell information about something and other [[mobile device]]s. [[Web search engine]] ability in a mobile form allows users to find mobile content on [[website]]s which are available to mobile devices on mobile networks. As this happens mobile content shows a media shift toward mobile multimedia. Simply put, mobile search is not just a spatial shift of PC web search to mobile equipment, but is witnessing more of treelike branching into specialized segments of mobile broadband and mobile content, both of which show a fast-paced evolution.

== Market description ==

"Competition for the US mobile search market promises to be fierce, thanks to the large US online ad market and strong pushes by portals. By 2019, mobile ad spending will rise to $65.87 billion, or 72.2% of total digital ad spend", according to a leading market research firm; [[eMarketer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Mobile-Will-Account-72-of-US-Digital-Ad-Spend-by-2019/1012258|title=Mobile Will Account for 72% of US Digital Ad Spend by 2019|work=[[eMarketer.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on a researcher's particular bias toward telecom, Web or technology factors, the published forecasts for global mobile search vary from $1.5 billion by 2011 (from Informa Telecoms &amp; Media) to over $11 billion by 2008 (according to [[Piper Jaffray]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?id=1005083|work=[[eMarketer.com]]|title=The Search Wars Are Going Mobile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobile search is important for the usability of [[mobile content]] for the same reasons as internet search engines became important to the usability of internet content. Early internet content was largely provided by portals such as [[Netscape]]. As the depth of available content grew, portals were unable to provide total coverage. As a result, [[Internet]] [[web search engine]]s such as [[Google]] and [[AltaVista]] proved popular as a way of allowing users to find the increasingly specialist content they were looking for. In an international journal article, 'Exploring the logic of mobile search', Westlund, Gómez-Barroso, Compañó, and Feijóo(2011) outline a thorough review of research on mobile search usage, and also present an in-depth study of user patterns. They conclude that mobile search has started to change mobile [[media consumption]] patterns radically. They also emphasize that future developments of mobile search must be sensitive to the mobile logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Westlund|first=Oscar|last2=Gómez-Barroso|first2=José-Luis|last3=Compañó|first3=Ramón|last4=Feijóo|first4=Claudio|year=2011|title=Exploring the logic of mobile search|work=Behaviour &amp; Information Technology|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a927256739~frm=abslink}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

Within the broad umbrella of mobile search (the ability to browse for mobile specific content), there are a range of services. Given the relative immaturity of the market, not all of these can be expected to become the industry standards.

===Mobile optimized search engines===
Most major search engines have implemented a mobile optimized version of their products that take into consideration bandwidth and form factor limitations of the mobile platform.  For example, Google has launched a mobile-friendly version of their search engine. The algorithms for mobile search engine results are thought to be evolving and aspects such as location and predictive searching will become increasingly important. [[Google]] just released its latest 160 page Full Search Quality Raters Guide&lt;ref&gt;[http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en//insidesearch/howsearchworks/assets/searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf "Search Quality Evaluator Guidelines" ''How Search Works'' November 12, 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt; with a new emphasis on Mobile and Usefulness.

===Mobile question and answer services===
These services allow a user to text a question to a central database and receive a reply using text. A usage example would be a user that wants to know the answer to a very specific question but is not in front of his/her computer. Most mobile 'Q&amp;A' services are powered by human researchers and are therefore a type of [[organic search engine]]. A new approach by [[AskMeNow]] and MobileBits is to use [[Semantic Web]] technology to automate the process.

===Mobile directory search===
This service is known by different names dependent on country and operator. It can also be known as 'Find My Nearest' or 'Mobile Yellow Pages' services. The basics of the services allow users to find local services in the vicinity of their current location. The services often use [[location-based service|location-based]] technology to pinpoint exactly where the user currently is. An example of usage would be a user looking for a local cab or taxi company after a night out. Services also usually come with a map and directions to help the user. An example is the service offered by [[Yell Group|Yell]] in the UK which is powered by MobilePeople's technology.

===Mobile discovery services===
These services offer users recommendations on what they should do next. An example would be recommending a user a similar ringtone to the one that s/he has just browsed for. They operate, in a mobile context, in a similar way to the recommendation engines provided by internet retail shops such as [[Amazon.com]]. An example of real usage is the Directory Enquiries (DQ) service operated by Orange in the UK. Callers to the Orange landline DQ service are given the business and residential numbers they have requested verbally by an operator. In addition, Orange sends the information in text format to the users mobile phone. The information contains a text reminder of the requested information as well as links to local businesses, services and other interesting information in the local area that the user has searched on.

===Mobile navigation services===
These services provide the indexing structure to the portals provided by [[mobile network operator|mobile operators]]. They index the content already on the operators' portal but also provide users access to mobile specific content that is available outside the confines of the portal.

===Dynamic mobile selection interface services===
A new category of mobile search tool that is emerging is one in which a pre-selected set of possible search content is downloaded in advance by a mobile user and then allows for a final internet search step.  An example of such search tools is the Worldport Navigator for the iPhone,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldport.net|title=Worldport Navigator for the iPhone}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides users with a push-button experience of selecting from thousands of human-screened and categorized Web selections in three or four seconds, without the need for text entry, search, result review, or page-scrolling.

'''Molinology''' (from [[Latin]]: molīna, mill; and [[Greek language|Greek]] λόγος, study) is the study of mills and other mechanical devices which use the energy of moving water or wind, or the strength of animal or human muscle to power machines for purposes such as [[hammer]]ing, [[Grinder (milling)|grinding]], [[pump]]ing, [[saw]]ing, [[Crusher|pressing]] or [[fulling]]. More particularly, molinology aims to retain the knowledge of those traditional engines which have been rendered obsolete by modern technical and economic trends. 

The term "Molinology" was coined in 1965 by the Portuguese industrial historian João Miguel dos Santos Simões. 

Cultural and scientific interest in molinology is maintained by [[The International Molinological Society]] (TIMS), a non-profit organisation which brings together around five hundred members worldwide. It was founded in 1973 after earlier international symposia in 1965 and 1969.

'''Navizon, Inc.''' is a provider of [[location-based service]]s and products. Navizon was an early developer of technology that makes it possible to determine the geographic position of a mobile device using as reference the location of [[cell phone tower]]s and [[Wi-Fi positioning system|Wi-Fi-based]] wireless [[Wireless access point|access points]] instead of [[GPS]]. Navizon also developed technology for locating mobile devices indoors with room and floor-level accuracy.

Navizon, initially known as Mexens Technology,  was founded by a team from the Internet Protocol geolocation market. Its founder and CEO, [[Cyril Houri]], was founder and CEO of Infosplit, a provider of IP address geolocation services started in 1999 that was acquired in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;"Navizon".

Mobile device users obtain their position through the Navizon app, which calculates the locations of [[cell site]]s and Wi-Fi access points by analyzing the signal strength at different locations.  Navizon's database of cellular tower and Wi-Fi access point locations was built by a global community of users through [[crowdsourcing]].&lt;ref&gt;Mike Hudson (August 8, 2009).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5114">'''Nelson rules''' are a method in [[process control]] of determining if some measured variable is out of control (unpredictable versus consistent). Rules,  for detecting "out-of-control" or non-random conditions were first postulated by [[Walter A. Shewhart]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmc/section3/pmc32.htm Engineering Statistics Handbook 6.3.2], NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook of Statistical Methods [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], Dec 2006&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1920s.  The Nelson rules were first published in the October 1984 issue of the ''[[Journal of Quality Technology]]'' in an article by [[Lloyd S Nelson]].&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd S. Nelson, "The Shewhart Control Chart—Tests for Special Causes". Journal of Quality Technology 16, no. 4 (October 1984), 238-239. https://doi.org/10.1080/00224065.1984.11978921&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules are applied to a [[control chart]] on which the magnitude of some [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]] is plotted against time. The rules are based on the [[mean]] value and the [[standard deviation]] of the samples.

|width="75pt"| &lt;center&gt;Rule 1&lt;/center&gt;||width="250pt"| One point is more than 3 standard deviations from the mean.|| [[File:Rule 1 - Control Charts for Nelson Rules.svg|256x192px|]]||width="250pt"| One sample (two shown in this case) is grossly out of control.
|-
| &lt;center&gt;Rule 2&lt;/center&gt; || Nine (or more) points in a row are on the same side of the mean. || [[File:Rule 2 - Control Charts for Nelson Rules.svg|256x192px]]|| Some prolonged [[systematic bias|bias]] exists.
|-
| &lt;center&gt;Rule 3&lt;/center&gt; || Six (or more) points in a row are continually increasing (or decreasing). ||[[File:Rule 3 - Control Charts for Nelson Rules.svg|256x192px]]|| A [[trend estimation|trend]] exists.
|-
| &lt;center&gt;Rule 4&lt;/center&gt; || Fourteen (or more) points in a row alternate in direction, increasing then decreasing. ||[[File:Rule 4 - Control Charts for Nelson Rules.svg|256x192px|]]|| This much [[Oscillation (mathematics)|oscillation]] is beyond [[Signal noise|noise]].

Note that the rule is concerned with directionality only. The position of the mean and the size of the standard deviation have no bearing.
|-
| &lt;center&gt;Rule 5&lt;/center&gt; || Two (or three) out of three points in a row are more than 2 standard deviations from the mean in the same direction.  ||[[File:Rule 5 - Control Charts for Nelson Rules.svg|256x192px]]|| There is a medium tendency for samples to be mediumly out of control.

The side of the mean for the third point is unspecified.
|-
| &lt;center&gt;Rule 6&lt;/center&gt; || Four (or five) out of five points in a row are more than 1 standard deviation from the mean in the same direction. ||[[File:Rule 6 - Control Charts for Nelson Rules.svg|256x192px]]|| There is a strong tendency for samples to be slightly out of control.

The side of the mean for the fifth point is unspecified.
|-
| &lt;center&gt;Rule 7&lt;/center&gt; || Fifteen points in a row are all within 1 standard deviation of the mean on either side of the mean. ||[[File:Rule 7 - Control Charts for Nelson Rules.svg|256x192px]]|| With 1 standard deviation, greater variation would be expected.

|-
| &lt;center&gt;Rule 8&lt;/center&gt; || Eight points in a row exist, but none within 1 standard deviation of the mean, and the points are in both directions from the mean.  ||[[File:Rule 8 - Control Charts for Nelson Rules.svg|256x192px |]]|| Jumping from above to below whilst missing the first standard deviation band is rarely random.
|}

The above eight rules apply to a chart of a variable value.

A second chart, the moving [[Range (statistics)|range]] chart, can also be used but only with rules 1, 2, 3 and 4. Such a chart plots a graph of the maximum value - minimum value of '''N''' adjacent points against the time sample of the range.

An example moving range: if N = 3 and values are 1, 3, 5, 3, 3, 2, 4, 5 then the sets of adjacent points are (1,3,5) (3,5,3) (5,3,3) (3,3,2) (3,2,4) (2,4,5) resulting in moving range values of (5-1) (5-3) (5-3) (3-2) (4-2) (5-2) = 4, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3.

Applying these rules indicates when a potential "out of control" situation has arisen. However, there will always be some false alerts and the more rules applied the more will occur. For some processes, it may be beneficial to omit one or more rules. Equally there may be some missing alerts where some specific "out of control" situation is not detected. Empirically, the detection [[accuracy]] is good.

The combination of '''politics and technology''' covers concepts, mechanisms, personalities, efforts, and [[social movement]]s including but not necessarily limited to the [[Internet]] and other [[Information technology|information and communication technologies]] (ICTs).

A growing body of scholarship has begun to explore how Internet technologies are influencing [[political communication]] and [[Participation (decision making)|participation]], especially in terms of what is known as the [[public sphere]].

One of the most influential and transformational information and communication technologies is the [[mobile phone]] or [[smartphone]], which can include: talk, text messaging, [[Internet]] and [[World Wide Web|Web]] access, [[electronic mail]], [[faxing]], pictures, video, and a wide variety of [[Mobile app|apps]]. Mobile devices are proving to increase political participation and are now even being portrayed as a voting gadget in even the [[least developed countries]]. Increased availability of this [[technology]] and subsequent access to the public sphere has enhanced the ability of individuals and groups to bring attention to and organize around specialized issues.&lt;ref&gt;Creeber, Glen. Digital Cultures: [understanding New Media]. Maidenhead: Open Univ., 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, [[social media]] has emerged to become one of the main areas of influence for [[politics]], where millions of users are able to learn about politicians' policies and statements, interact with political leaders, organize, and voice their own opinions on political matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Politics and the Twitter revolution : how tweets influence the relationship between political leaders and the public|last2=Bichard|first2=Shannon|date=2012|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=9780739165010|location=Lanham, MD|page=1|pages=|last1=Parmelee|first1=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The digital public sphere ==
The idea of the [[public sphere]] has generally come to be understood as the open social spaces and [[public space]]s in which private citizens interact and share information and ideas relevant to the society. These can include, for example, town halls, public squares, markets, coffee shops, or what ancient Greeks called [[agora]]s. Many scholars have argued that these spaces are vitally important for creating and maintaining an active and informed public in a democratic society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/24669015|title=Free spaces : the sources of democratic change in America|last=Evans|first=Sara M.|last2=Boyte|first2=Harry C.|date=1992|publisher=University of Chicago Press|others=|year=|isbn=978-0226222578|edition= 2nd|location=Chicago|pages=|oclc=24669015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jürgen Habermas]]' book  ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere|The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere – An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society]]'', he defines the public sphere as "a realm of social life in which public opinion can be formed."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/18327374|title=The structural transformation of the public sphere : an inquiry into a category of bourgeois society|last=Jürgen|first=Habermas|publisher=|year=1962|isbn=978-0262081801|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=|oclc=18327374}}&lt;/ref&gt; In principle, the public sphere should be open to all citizens, and free from influence from governments or private businesses. Habermas goes on to argue that:&lt;blockquote href="Digital rights"&gt;"A portion of the public sphere is constituted in every conversation in which private persons come together to form a public. They are then acting neither as business or professional people conducting their private affairs, nor as legal consociates subject to the legal regulations of a state bureaucracy and obligated to obedience. Citizens act as a public when they deal with matters of general interest without being subject to coercion; thus with the guarantee that they may assemble and unite freely, and express and publicize their opinions freely."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Howard Rheingold]] argues that, "There is an intimate connection between informal conversations, the kind that take place in communities... and the ability of large social groups to govern themselves without monarchs or dictators.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44162557|title=The virtual community : homesteading on the electronic frontier|last=Howard.|first=Rheingold,|date=2000|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0262681216|edition= Rev. |location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=44162557}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rheingold and others&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dahlgren|first=Peter|date=2006|title=The Internet, Public Spheres, and Political Communication: Dispersion and Deliberation|journal=Political Communication|volume=22|issue=2|pages=147–162|doi=10.1080/10584600590933160}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also gone on to argue that virtual spaces created through the [[Internet]] and related [[Information and communications technology|information and communications technologies]] have led to the emergence of a new type of digital public sphere. Some scholars have conceptualized this alternately as a virtual public sphere&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Papacharissi|first=Zizi|date=2002|title=The virtual sphere|journal=New Media &amp; Society|language=en|volume=4|issue=1|pages=9–27|doi=10.1177/14614440222226244|issn=1461-4448}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a networked public sphere,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shirky|first=Clay|date=2011|title=The Political Power of Social Media: Technology, the Public Sphere, and Political Change|jstor=25800379|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=90|issue=1|pages=28–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/961312425|title=Twitter and tear gas : the power and fragility of networked protest|last=Zeynep|first=Tufekci|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=9780300215120|location=New Haven|pages=|oclc=961312425}}&lt;/ref&gt; while still others have similarly described what they call a networked society&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/855022865|title=Communication power|last=Castells|first=Manuel|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780191510434|edition= 2nd|location=Oxford|pages=|oclc=855022865}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/795757037|title=Networks of outrage and hope: social movements in the Internet age|last=Castells|first=Manuel|date=|publisher=Polity|year=2015|isbn=9780745662855|edition= 2nd|location=Cambridge|pages=|oclc=795757037}}&lt;/ref&gt; or networked publics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/283798198|title=Networked Publics|last=Varnelis|first=Kazys|date=|publisher=MIT Press|others=Annenberg Center for Communication (University of Southern California)|year=2008|isbn=9780262285483|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=|oclc=283798198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, these new virtual spaces can be used in much the same way as traditional, offline spaces; that is, as a "free space"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48943689|title=Democratic phoenix : reinventing political activism|last=Pippa|first=Norris|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=978-0521811774|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=|oclc=48943689}}&lt;/ref&gt; to discuss and debate ideas of public importance. Just as the public sphere is a combination of "every conversation in which private persons come together to form a public"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the digital public sphere also comprises all forms of [[new media]], such as [[chat room]]s, website comment sections, and [[social media]], in which private citizens engage in discourse as a public. Virtual spaces may overlap or interact with offline spaces as well, forming what has been called "hybrid networks".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lim|first=Merlyna|date=2015|title=A CyberUrban Space Odyssey: The Spatiality of Contemporary Social Movements|url=https://www.academia.edu/16240525|journal=New Geographies|language=en|volume=7|pages=117–123|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars argue that social media affords increasing opportunities for political discourse and mobilization within the digital public sphere.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loader|first=Brian D.|last2=Mercea|first2=Dan|date=2011|title=Networking Democracy?

=== Criticisms ===

==== Social exclusion ====
The traditional, offline public sphere has been criticized for not being as inclusive in practice as it is in theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/23650367|title=Habermas and the public sphere|last=|first=|publisher=MIT Press|others=|year=1992|isbn=978-0262031837|editor-last=Calhoun|editor-first=Craig J.|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=|oclc=23650367}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Feminist scholars like [[Nancy Fraser]] have argued that the public sphere has historically not been as open or accessible to [[Social exclusion|disadvantaged or marginalized groups]] in a society, such as women or people of color; therefore, such groups are forced to form their own separate public spheres, which she refers to as a [[Counterpublic|counter-public]] or ''subaltern counter public''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fraser|first=Nancy|date=1990|title=Rethinking the Public Sphere: A Contribution to the Critique of Actually Existing Democracy|jstor=466240|journal=Social Text|issue=25/26|pages=56–80|doi=10.2307/466240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars contend that online spaces are more open and thus may help to increase inclusive political participation from marginalized groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schlosberg|first=David|last2=Dryzek|first2=John S.|date=2002|title=Digital Democracy: Authentic or Virtual?|jstor=26162195|journal=Organization &amp; Environment|volume=15|issue=3|pages=332–335}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, [[Anonymity|anonymous]] online spaces should allow all individuals to speak with an equal voice to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deseriis|first=M.|date=2013|title=Is Anonymous a New Form of Luddism?: A Comparative Analysis of Industrial Machine Breaking, Computer Hacking, and Related Rhetorical Strategies|journal=Radical History Review|language=en|volume=2013|issue=117|pages=33–48|doi=10.1215/01636545-2210437|issn=0163-6545}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other have pointed out that many contemporary online spaces are not anonymous, such as [[Facebook]]. Avatars and social media profiles often portray an individual's offline identity, which can lead to practices of online discrimination and exclusion which mirror offline inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/214085023|title=Digitizing race : visual cultures of the Internet|last=Lisa|first=Nakamura|date=2008|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=|isbn=9780816653775|location=Minneapolis|pages=|oclc=214085023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now, more and more historically disadvantaged or marginalized groups are also using Internet technology to carve out new online spaces for their own "networked counterpublics" such as through the use of [[hashtag]]s like #Ferguson and [[Black Lives Matter|#BlackLivesMatter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Sarah J.|last2=Foucault Welles|first2=Brooke|date=2015|title=Hijacking #myNYPD: Social Media Dissent and Networked Counterpublics|journal=Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=65|issue=6|pages=932–952|doi=10.1111/jcom.12185|issn=0021-9916}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Sarah J.|last2=Foucault Welles|first2=Brooke|date=2016|title=#Ferguson is everywhere: initiators in emerging counterpublic networks|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|volume=19|issue=3|pages=397–418|doi=10.1080/1369118X.2015.1106571}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The digital divide ====
Another factor which affects access to the digital public sphere is the [[digital divide]], which refers to how people from [[Least Developed Countries|less developed countries]] tend to have less access to [[Information and communications technology|information and communications technologies]] compared to those from more [[Developed country|developed countries]]. For example, the most developed regions of the world, such as North America and Western Europe, have the highest [[Global Internet usage|Internet penetration rates]] at over 80% each, while the least developed countries such as in Africa and South Asia have less than 30% each.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/269329/penetration-rate-of-the-internet-by-region/|title=Global regional internet penetration rate 2017 {{!}} Statistic|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the reduced cost and increasing availability of mobile devices such as [[smartphone]]s throughout less developed regions is helping to reduce this disparity at an exponential rate. In just two years, between 2013 and 2015, the number of Internet users in developing nations has risen by 9%, according to the [[Pew Research Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2016/02/22/smartphone-ownership-and-internet-usage-continues-to-climb-in-emerging-economies/|title=Smartphone Ownership and Internet Usage Continues to Climb in Emerging Economies|date=2016-02-22|work=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project|access-date=2018-07-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has shown, though, that even within more developed countries like the United States, the digital divide continues to persist between upper and lower socioeconomic classes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/broadband-adoption-rates-and-gaps-in-u-s-metropolitan-areas/|title=Broadband adoption rates and gaps in U.S. metropolitan areas|last=Tomer|first=Adie|date=2015|work=Brookings|access-date=2018-07-01|last2=Kane|first2=Jospeh|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and between different education levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/05/some-americans-dont-use-the-internet-who-are-they/|title=11% of Americans don’t use the internet. Who are they?|date=2018-03-05|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2018-07-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, scholars like [[Mark Warschauer]] argue that it is not just access to technology that matters, but the knowledge of how to put that technology to use in meaningful ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50028800|title=Technology and social inclusion : rethinking the digital divide|last=Mark.|first=Warschauer,|date=2003|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0262232241|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=50028800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3709">'''Porting Authorization Code''' ('''PAC''') is a [[unique identifier]] (normally 9 characters long and in the format "ABC123456") used by some [[mobile network operators]] to facilitate [[mobile number portability]] (MNP). This allows users to retain their mobile telephone number when switching operators.

==United Kingdom==
Telecommunications service is regulated in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] by [[Ofcom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/Thegroup/RegulatoryandPublicaffairs/RegulationsintheUK/index.htm|title=Regulation in the UK|website=www.btplc.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 July 2003, Ofcom introduced the ''General Conditions of Entitlement'' which apply to all communications networks and service providers in the UK. Several amendments to this original document have been issued since this time

Condition 18 requires all providers to provide number portability but only to subscribers of [[Publicly Available Telephone Services|publicly available telephone services]] who request it. Number portability must be provided as soon as practicable and on reasonable terms to subscribers and bilateral porting arrangements between providers must accord with agreed processes.

#A current Service Provider must give a customer a Porting Authorisation Code (PAC) or a reason why it cannot be issued within 2 working hours of their request (if for less than 26 numbers) or 10 working days (if 26+ numbers)
#A PAC is valid for a period of 30 calendar days from the day of PAC issue and the customer's request must be submitted to their new Service Provider within that time.
#A number can then be transferred anytime between 1 and 32 calendar days from the date the PAC is issued.

Some mobile phone companies can charge a fee to move the customer's number. This is usually no more than £25.  The provider must issue a PAC within 2 hours of the port-out request, if such request was made over the phone for fewer than 25 numbers on a single account. Customer debt is not a valid reason for a service provider to refuse issuing of a PAC. Service providers may not treat PAC requests as requests to terminate service. Pay-as-you-go customers will lose any unused credit when switching service providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.portnumber.co.uk/help#transfer-payg-credit|title=Port Number UK|website=www.portnumber.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1st July 2019, customers will be able to request a PAC by text message, rather than having to call their existing network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uswitch.com/mobiles/news/2017/12/uswitch-welcomes-ofcom-mobile-switching-plans/|title=Ofcom changes rules to allow switching network with single SMS|website=www.uswitch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==

In India, the code is known as a 'Unique Porting Code (UPC)'. The rules for number portability are prescribed by the [[TRAI|Telecom Regulatory Authority of India]].

*You are allowed to move to another mobile service provider only after 90 days of the date of activation of your mobile connection or from the date of last porting of your mobile number, whichever is applicable.
*You are allowed to change mobile service provider across the country.
*If you are a pre-paid subscriber, note that the balance amount of talk time, if any, at the time of porting will lapse.
*If you are a post-paid subscriber, ensure that you have paid all the dues as per your last bill. (You will also have to sign an undertaking on the porting form.)

A '''professional network service''' (or, in an [[Internet]] context, simply '''professional network''') is a type of [[social network service]] that is focused solely on interactions and relationships of a business nature rather than including personal, nonbusiness interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118825239984310205 |title=Social Networking Goes Professional |author=Jessica E. Vascellaro |publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=2007-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A professional network service is used by business individuals to establish and maintain professional contacts&lt;ref name='IJMR Article'&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.mrs.org.uk/ijmr_article/article/104155|authors=Aichner, T. and Jacob, F.|title=Measuring the Degree of Corporate Social Media Use|journal=International Journal of Market Research|date=March 2015|volume=57|issue=2|pages=257–275}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a way to either find work or get ahead in career as well as gain resources and opportunities for networking. According to LinkedIn managing director Clifford Rosenberg in an interview by AAP in 2010, "[t]his is really a call to action for professionals to re-address their use of social networks and begin to reap as many rewards from networking professionally as they do personally." Businesses mostly depend on resources and information outside company and in order to get what they need, they need to reach out and professionally network to others, such as employees or clients as well as potential opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/business/breaking-news/career-rewards-can-flow-from-social-media/story-e6freuyr-1225968705767 |title=Career rewards can flow from social media |author=AAP |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Nardi, Whittaker and Schwarz (2002) point at three main tasks that they believe networkers need to attend in order to keep a successful professional (intentional) network:
building a network, maintaining the network and activating selected contacts. They stress that networkers need to continue to add new contacts to their network in order to access as many resources as possible, and to maintain their network through staying in touch with their contacts. This is so that the contacts are easy to activate when the networker has work that needs to be done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/226512/Professional_Networking_Online_A_qualitative_study_of_LinkedIn_use_in_Norway |title=Professional Networking Online: A qualitative study of LinkedIn use in Norway |author=Linda Elen Olsen |publisher=[[University of Bergen]]: Department of Information Science and Media Studies |date=May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By using a professional network service, businesses are able to keep all of their networks up-to-date, in order, and help figure out the best way to efficiently get in touch with each of them. A service that can do all that helps relieve some of the stress when trying to get things done.

Not all professional network services are online sites that help promote a business. There are services that connect the user to other services that help promote the business other than online sites, such as phone/Internet companies that provide services and companies that specifically are designed to do all of the promoting, online and in person, for a business.

==History==
In 1997, professional network services started up throughout the world and continue to grow. The first recognizable site to combine all features, such as create profiles, add friends, and search friends, was [[SixDegrees.com]]. According to Boyd and Ellison's article, "Social Network Sites: Definition, History, and Scholarship", "[f]rom 1997 to 2001, a number of community tools began supporting various combinations of profiles and publicly articulated Friends". Boyd and Ellison go on to say that the next wave began with [http://www.ryze.com Ryze.com] in 2001. It was introduced as a new way "to help people leverage their business networks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Social Network Sites: Definition, History, and Scholarship |author1=Danah M. Boyd |author2=Nicole B. Ellison |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Inc |date=2007 |doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00393.x |volume=13 |issue=1 |journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication |pages=210–230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inside the works==
Quite a lot of work is put into a professional network service, such as the amount of hours that go into them and the type of people they work for, as well as the business model of it all, such as the professional interaction and the multiple services they deal with.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}{{Vague|date=June 2015}}

===Types of services===
Some professional network services do not only help promote the business, but can also help in connecting to other people. Those services may include a specific phone and/or Internet company or a company that helps to connect with other businesses. According to the Society for New Communications Research (SNCR), there are at least nine online professional networks that are being used.

===Professional interaction===
Kaplan and Haenlein go on to discuss the five points about using media for companies. They say you need to choose carefully, pick the application or make your own, ensure activity alignment, integrate a media plan, and allow access for all.

====Choose carefully====
"Choosing the right medium for any given purpose depends on the target group to be reached and the message to be communicated. On one hand, each Social Media application usually attracts a certain group of people and firms should be active wherever their customers are present. On the other hand, there may be situations whereby certain features are necessary to ensure effective communication, and these features are only offered by one specific application."

====Ensure activity alignment====
"Sometimes you may decide to rely on various Social Media, or a set of different applications within the same group, in order to have the largest possible reach." "Using different contact channels can be a worthwhile and profitable strategy." According to the Society for New Communications Research at Harvard University "the average professional belongs to 3-5 online networks for business use, and LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter are among the top used."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/fred.zimny/the-new-symbiosis-of-professional-networks-social-medias-impact-on-business-and-decision-making |title=The New Symbiosis of Professional Networks Survey Results |author1=[[Vanessa DiMauro]] |author2=Don Bulmer |publisher=Harvard University |pages=3 |date=2009-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Integrate a media plan====
Social media and traditional media are "both part of the same: your corporate image" in the customers' eyes.

====Allow access for all====
"...once the firm has decided to utilize Social Media applications, it is worth checking that all employees may actually access them." According to the SNCR "the convergence of Internet, mobile, and social media has taken significant shape as professionals rely on anywhere access to information, relationships and networks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/fred.zimny/the-new-symbiosis-of-professional-networks-social-medias-impact-on-business-and-decision-making |title=The New Symbiosis of Professional Networks Survey Results |author1=[[Vanessa DiMauro]] |author2=Don Bulmer |publisher=Harvard University |pages=3 |date=2009-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Online usage====
"Half of respondents report participating in 3 to 5 online professional networks. Another three in ten participate in 6 or more professional networks." "Popular social networks are now being used frequently as Professional Communities. More than nine in ten respondents indicated that they use LinkedIn and half reported using Facebook. Twitter and blogs were frequently listed as 'professional networks'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/fred.zimny/the-new-symbiosis-of-professional-networks-social-medias-impact-on-business-and-decision-making |title=The New Symbiosis of Professional Networks Survey Results |author1=[[Vanessa DiMauro]] |author2=Don Bulmer |publisher=Harvard University |pages=5, 6 |date=2009-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business model===
According to [[Michael Rappa]]'s article, Business models on the web", "a [[business model]] is the method of doing business by which a company can sustain itself – that is, generate [[revenue]]. The business model spells-out how a company makes money by specifying where it is positioned in the [[value chain]]." Rappa mentions that there are at least nine basic categories in which a business model can be separated from. Those categories are [[brokerage]], [[advertising]], [[infomediary]], [[merchant]], [[manufacturer]], [[affiliate (commerce)|affiliate]], [[community]], [[subscription]], and [[utility]]. "...a firm may combine several different models as part of its overall Internet business strategy." At first, [[Flickr]] started off as a way to mainstream [[public relations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business models on the web |author=Michael Rappa |journal=North Carolina State University (ecommerce.ncsu.edu) |volume=13 |date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social impact==
When it comes to the social impact that professional network services have on today's society, it has proved to increase activity. According to the SNCR, "[t]hree quarters of respondents rely on professional networks to support business decisions. Reliance has increased for essentially all respondents over the past three years. Younger (20–35) and older professionals (55+) are more active users of social tools than middle aged professionals. There are more people collaborating outside their company wall than within their organizational intranet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/fred.zimny/the-new-symbiosis-of-professional-networks-social-medias-impact-on-business-and-decision-making |title=The New Symbiosis of Professional Networks Survey Results |author1=Vanessa DiMauro |author2=Don Bulmer |publisher=Harvard University |pages=4 |date=2009-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
Since the internet and social media are a part of this "world where consumers can speak so freely with each other and businesses have increasingly less control over the information available about them in cyberspace", most firms and businesses are uncomfortable with all of the freedom. According to Kaplan and Haenlein's article, "Users of the world, unite! The challenges and opportunities of Social Media", businesses are pushed aside and are only able to sit back and watch as their customers publicly post comments, which may or may not be well written.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007681309001232 |title=Users of the world, unite! The challenges and opportunities of Social Media |author1=Andreas M. Kaplan |author2=Michael Haenlein |journal=[[Business Horizons]] |date=2007-08-28 |doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2009.09.003 |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=59–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WAP Push Process.jpg|thumb|300px|WAP Push Process]]
A '''Push Proxy Gateway''' is a component of [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]] Gateways that pushes URL notifications to mobile handsets. Notifications typically include [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]], email, IM, ringtone downloads, and new device firmware notifications. Most notifications will have an audible alert to the user of the device.  The notification will typically be a text string with a URL link. Note that only a notification is pushed to the device; the device must do something with the notification in order to download or view the content associated with it.

==Technical specifications==
===PUSH to PPG===
A push message is sent as an [[HTTP]] POST to the Push Proxy Gateway.  The POST will be a multipart XML document, with the first part being the PAP (Push Access Protocol) Section and the second part being either a '''Service Indication''' or a '''Service Loading'''.&lt;!--both currently redirect here, hence bold--&gt;

  +---------------------------------------------+  
  | HTTP POST                                   |  \
  +---------------------------------------------+   |  WAP
  | PAP XML                                     |   |  PUSH
  +---------------------------------------------+   |  Flow
  | Service Indication or Service Loading XML   |  /
  +---------------------------------------------+

====POST====
The POST contains at a minimum the URL being posted to (this is not standard across different PPG vendors), and the content type.

An example of a PPG POST:
  POST /somelocation HTTP/1.1
  Host: ppg.somecarrier.com
  Content-Type: multipart/related; boundary=someboundarymesg; type="application/xml"

====PAP====
The PAP XML contains at the minimum, a &lt;pap&gt; element, a &lt;push-message&gt; element, and an &lt;address&gt; element.

An example of a PAP XML:
  --someboundarymesg
  Content-Type: application/xml
  
  &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
  &lt;!DOCTYPE pap PUBLIC "-//WAPFORUM//DTD PAP 1.0//EN" "http://www.wapforum.org/DTD/pap_1.0.dtd"&gt;
  &lt;pap&gt;
  &lt;push-message push-id="some_push_id"&gt;
  &lt;address address-value="WAPPUSH=+12065551212/TYPE=PLMN@ppg.somecarrier.com" /&gt;
  &lt;/push-message&gt;
  &lt;/pap&gt;

The important parts of this PAP message are the address value and type.  The value is typically a [[MSISDN]] and type indicates whether to send to an MSISDN (typical case) or to an IP Address.  The TYPE is almost always MSISDN as the Push Initiator (PI) will not typically have the Mobile Station's IP address - which is generally dynamic.  In the case of IP Address:
  TYPE=USER@a.b.c.d

Additional capability of PAP can be found in the [[Push Access Protocol|PAP]] article.

====Service Indication====
A PUSH Service Indication (SI) contains at a minimum an &lt;si&gt; element and a &lt;indication&gt; element.

An example of a Service Indication:
  --someboundarymesg
  Content-Type: text/vnd.wap.si
  
  &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
  &lt;!DOCTYPE si PUBLIC "-//WAPFORUM//DTD SI 1.0//EN" "http://www.wapforum.org/DTD/si.dtd"&gt;
  &lt;si&gt;
  &lt;indication si-id=345532 href="http://mmsc.somecarrier.com/CFJIOJF43F{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}"&gt;
  A new MMS has been received, download?
  &lt;/indication&gt;
  &lt;/si&gt;

===PPG delivery to mobile station===
Once a push message is received from the Push Initiator, the PPG has two avenues for delivery.  If the IP address of the Mobile Station is known to the PPG, the PPG can deliver directly to the mobile station over an IP bearer.  This is known as "Connection Oriented Push".  If the IP address of the mobile station is not known to the PPG, the PPG will deliver over an [[Short message service|SMS]] bearer.  Delivery over an SMS bearer is known as "Connectionless Push".

====Connectionless Push====
In Connectionless Push, an [[Short Message Service Center|SMSC]] BIND is required for the PPG to deliver its push message to the mobile station. Typically, a PPG will have a local SMS queuing mechanism running locally that it BINDs to, and which in turn BINDs to the carrier's SMSC.  This mechanism should allow for queuing in the event of an SMS infrastructure outage, and also provide for message throttling.

Since a WAP Push message can be larger than a single SMS message can contain, the push message may be broken up into multiple SMS messages, as a multipart SMS.

====Connection Oriented Push====
In Connection Oriented pushes (where the device supports it), an [[Short Message Service Center|SMSC]] BIND is not required if the gateway is aware of the handsets IP Address. If the gateway is unable to determine the IP Address of the handset, or is unable to connect to the device, the push notification will be encoded and sent as an [[Short message service|SMS]].

Connection Oriented Push is used less frequently than Connectionless Push for several reasons including:
* Devices while registered to the network, may not have a data session (PDP Context in the GSM world) established.
* A separate IP-&gt;MSISDN table has to be maintained in Connection Oriented Push.
* Typically, the PPG or another part of the gateway has to receive [[RADIUS]] or other accounting packets in order to support Connection Oriented Push.

===Other PUSH Attributes===
* Push notifications can be confirmed or unconfirmed.  Most carriers use unconfirmed pushes due to the high volume and resource constraints related to confirmed push.  This is controlled by setting confirmed in the  quality-of-service tag element.
* Push notifications can be set to expire if not delivered before a certain time.  This is controlled by setting deliver-before-timestamp in the pushmessage element.

Many other attributes exist and are detailed in the specifications at the [[Open Mobile Alliance]] and other sites.

==PPG Vendors==
PPG vendors include [[Nokia Siemens Networks]], [[Ericsson]], [[Gemini Mobile Technologies]], [[Openwave]], [[Acision]], [[Huawei]], [http://www.azetti.com Azetti], Alcatel,[https://web.archive.org/web/20090813051635/http://www.wit-software.com/ WIT Software], ZTE, and open source [[Kannel (telecommunications)|Kannel]].

[[File:Nature cover, November 4, 1869.jpg|thumb|Cover of the first issue of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', 4 November 1869]]
In [[academic publishing]], a '''scientific journal''' is a [[periodical publication]] intended to further the progress of [[science]], usually by reporting new [[research]].

==Content==
Articles in scientific journals are mostly written by active scientists such as students, researchers and professors instead of professional journalists. There are thousands of scientific journals in publication, and many more have been published at various points in the past (see [[list of scientific journals]]). Most journals are highly specialized, although some of the oldest journals such as ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' publish articles and [[scientific paper]]s across a wide range of scientific fields. Scientific journals contain articles that have been [[Scholarly peer review|peer review]]ed, in an attempt to ensure that articles meet the journal's standards of quality, and scientific [[Validity (logic)|validity]]. Although scientific journals are superficially similar to [[professional]] [[magazine]]s, they are actually quite different. Issues of a scientific journal are rarely read casually, as one would read a magazine. The publication of the results of research is an essential part of the [[scientific method]]. If they are describing experiments or calculations, they must supply enough details that an independent researcher could repeat the experiment or calculation to verify the results. Each such journal article becomes part of the permanent scientific record.

==Scope==
Articles in scientific journals can be used in research and higher education. Scientific articles allow researchers to keep up to date with the developments of their field and direct their own research. An essential part of a scientific article is citation of earlier work. The impact of articles and journals is often assessed by counting citations ([[citation impact]]). Some classes are partially devoted to the explication of classic articles, and [[seminar]] classes can consist of the presentation by each student of a classic or current paper. Schoolbooks and textbooks have been written usually only on established topics, while the latest research and more obscure topics are only accessible through scientific articles. In a scientific research group or [[academic department]] it is usual for the content of current scientific journals to be discussed in [[journal club]]s. Public funding bodies often require the results to be published in scientific journals. Academic credentials for promotion into academic ranks are established in large part by the number and impact of scientific articles published. Many doctoral programs allow for [[thesis by publication]], where the candidate is required to publish a certain number of scientific articles.

==Wording==
Articles tend to be highly technical, representing the latest theoretical research and experimental results in the field of science covered by the journal. They are often incomprehensible to anyone except for researchers in the field and advanced students. In some subjects this is inevitable given the nature of the content. Usually, rigorous rules of [[scientific writing]] are enforced by the editors; however, these rules may vary from journal to journal, especially between journals from different publishers. Articles are usually either original articles reporting completely new results or reviews of current literature. There are also scientific publications that bridge the gap between articles and books by publishing thematic volumes of chapters from different authors. Many journals have a regional focus, specializing in publishing papers from a particular geographic region, like ''[[African Invertebrates]]''.

== History ==
The history of scientific journals dates from 1665, when the French ''[[Journal des sçavans]]'' and the English ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'' first began systematically publishing research results. Over a thousand, mostly [[ephemeral]], were founded in the 18th century, and the number has increased rapidly after that.&lt;ref&gt;D. A. Kronick, ''History of Scientific and Technical Periodicals'', 2nd ed. Scarecrow, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to mid-20th century, [[Scholarly peer review|peer review]] was not always necessary, but gradually it became essentially compulsory.

== Publishing process ==
The authors of scientific articles are active researchers instead of journalists; typically, a graduate student or a researcher writes a paper with a professor. As such, the authors are unpaid and receive no compensation from the journal. However, their funding bodies may require them to publish in scientific journals. The paper is submitted to the journal office, where the '''editor''' considers the paper for appropriateness, potential scientific impact and novelty. If the journal's editor considers the paper appropriate, the paper is submitted to [[scholarly peer review]]. Depending on the field, journal and paper, the paper is sent to 1–3 '''reviewers''' for evaluation before they can be granted permission to publish. Reviewers are expected to check the paper for soundness of its scientific argument, i.e. if the data collected or considered in the paper support the conclusion offered. Novelty is also key: existing work must be appropriately considered and referenced, and new results improving on the state of the art presented. Reviewers are usually unpaid and not a part of the journal staff—instead, they should be "peers", i.e. researchers in the same field as the paper in question.

== Standards and impact ==
The standards that a journal uses to determine publication can vary widely. Some journals, such as ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', ''[[PNAS]]'', and ''[[Physical Review Letters]]'', have a reputation of publishing articles that mark a fundamental breakthrough in their respective fields.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} In many fields, a formal or informal hierarchy of scientific journals exists; the most prestigious journal in a field tends to be the most selective in terms of the articles it will select for publication, and usually will also have the highest [[impact factor]]. In some countries, journal rankings can be utilized for funding decisions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://julkaisufoorumi.fi/en/publication-forum/background|title=Background - julkaisufoorumi.fi|author=|date=|website=julkaisufoorumi.fi|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930090021/http://www.julkaisufoorumi.fi/en/publication-forum/background|archivedate=30 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even evaluation of individual researchers, although they are poorly suited for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://julkaisufoorumi.fi/en/evaluations/faq|title=FAQ - julkaisufoorumi.fi|author=|date=|website=julkaisufoorumi.fi|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171127065227/http://www.julkaisufoorumi.fi/en/evaluations/faq|archivedate=27 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reproducibility and Replicability ==
For scientific journal [[Reproducibility]] and [[Replicability]] are core concepts that allow other scientist to check and reproduce the results under the same conditions mentioned in the paper or at least similar conditions and produce similar results with similar [[measurements]] of the same [[:wikt:measurand|measurand]] or carried out under changed conditions of measurement.

==Types of articles==
{{further information|Scientific paper}}
{{see also|Academic publishing#Categories of papers{{!}}Categories of academic articles}}

[[File:1665 phil trans vol i title.png|thumb|Cover of the first volume of the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'', the first journal in the world exclusively devoted to science]]

There are several types of journal articles; the exact terminology and definitions vary by field and specific journal, but often include:
*'''Letters''' (also called ''communications'', and not to be confused with ''letters to the editor'') are short descriptions of important current research findings that are usually fast-tracked for immediate publication because they are considered urgent.
*'''Research notes''' are short descriptions of current research findings that are considered less urgent or important than ''Letters''.
*'''Articles''' are usually between five and twenty pages and are complete descriptions of current original research findings, but there are considerable variations between scientific fields and journals—80-page articles are not rare in [[mathematics]] or [[theoretical computer science]].
*'''Supplemental articles''' contain a large volume of tabular [[data]] that is the result of current research and may be dozens or hundreds of pages with mostly numerical data. Some journals now only publish this data electronically on the Internet. Supplemental information also contains other voluminous material not appropriate for the main body of the article, like descriptions of routine procedures, derivations of equations, source code, non-essential data, spectra or other such miscellaneous information.
*'''[[Review article]]s''' do not cover original research but rather accumulate the results of many different ''articles'' on a particular topic into a coherent narrative about the state of the art in that field. Review articles provide information about the topic and also provide journal references to the original research. Reviews may be entirely narrative, or may provide quantitative summary estimates resulting from the application of [[meta-analysis|meta-analytical methods]].
*'''[[Data paper]]s''' are articles dedicated to describe datasets. This type of article is becoming popular and journals exclusively dedicated to them have been established, e.g. ''[[Scientific_Data_(journal)|Scientific Data]]'' and ''[[Earth_Observation|Earth System Science Data]]''.
*'''[[Video paper]]s''' are a recent addition to practice of scientific publications. They most often combine an online video demonstration of a new technique or protocol combined with a rigorous textual description.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jove.com/|title=JoVE - Peer Reviewed Scientific Video Journal - Methods and Protocols|author=|date=|website=www.jove.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322165712/https://www.jove.com/|archivedate=22 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://videonauka.ru/|title=Научный журнал "Видеонаука"|date=|website=Scientific journal "Videonauka"|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311184031/http://videonauka.ru/|archivedate=2016-03-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formats of journal articles vary, but many follow the general [[IMRAD]] scheme recommended by the [[International Committee of Medical Journal Editors]]. Such articles begin with an ''[[Abstract (summary)|abstract]]'', which is a one-to-four-paragraph summary of the paper. The ''introduction'' describes the background for the research including a discussion of similar research. The ''materials and methods'' or ''experimental'' section provides specific details of how the research was conducted. The ''results and discussion'' section describes the outcome and implications of the research, and the ''conclusion'' section places the research in context and describes avenues for further exploration.

In addition to the above, some scientific journals such as ''Science'' will include a news section where scientific developments (often involving political issues) are described. These articles are often written by science journalists and not by scientists. In addition, some journals will include an editorial section and a section for letters to the editor. While these are articles published within a journal, in general they are not regarded as scientific journal articles because they have not been peer-reviewed.

==Electronic publishing==
{{Main article|Eprint|Electronic article|Electronic journal}}
Electronic publishing is a new area of information [[dissemination]]. One definition of electronic publishing is in the context of the scientific journal. It is the presentation of scholarly scientific results in only an electronic (non-paper) form. This is from its first write-up, or creation, to its publication or dissemination. The electronic scientific journal is specifically designed to be presented on the internet. It is defined as not being previously printed material adapted, or retooled, and then delivered electronically.&lt;ref name=Heller/&gt;&lt;ref name= Boyce-Dalterio/&gt;

Electronic publishing will exist alongside paper publishing, because printed paper publishing is not expected to disappear in the future. Output to a screen is important for browsing and searching but is not well adapted for extensive reading. Paper copies of selected information will definitely be required{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}. Therefore, the article has to be transmitted electronically to the reader's local printer. Formats suitable both for reading on paper, and for manipulation by the reader's computer will need to be integrated.&lt;ref name=Heller/&gt;&lt;ref name= Boyce-Dalterio/&gt; Many journals are electronically available in formats readable on screen via [[web browsers]], as well as in portable document format [[PDF]], suitable for printing and storing on a local desktop or laptop computer. New tools such as [[JATS]] and [[Utopia Documents]] provide a 'bridge' to the 'web-versions' in that they connect the content in PDF versions directly to the [[WorldWideWeb]] via hyperlinks that are created 'on-the-fly'. The PDF version of an article is usually seen as the version of record, but the matter is subject to some debate.&lt;ref name="Pettifer 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Pettifer, S. |author2=McDermott, P. |author3=Marsh, J. |author4=Thorne, D. |author5=Villeger, A. |author6=Attwood, T.K. |title=Ceci n'est pas un hamburger: modelling and representing the scholarly article |journal=Learned Publishing |year=2011 |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=207–220 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/alpsp/lp/2011/00000024/00000003/art00009 |doi=10.1087/20110309 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021094618/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/alpsp/lp/2011/00000024/00000003/art00009 |archivedate=2012-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electronic counterparts of established print journals already promote and deliver rapid dissemination of peer reviewed and edited, "published" articles. Other journals, whether spin-offs of established print journals, or created as electronic only, have come into existence promoting the rapid dissemination capability, and availability, on the Internet. In tandem with this is the speeding up of peer review, copyediting, page makeup, and other steps in the process to support rapid dissemination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2022/148/WP02-12B.html;jsessionid=8E99F087A1E6FFEC3DBC59015C33BAF1|title=The Internet and the Velocity of Scholarly Journal Publishing|last=Swygart-Hobaugh|first=Rob Kling, Amanda J.|website=scholarworks.iu.edu|access-date=2016-10-26|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027060130/https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2022/148/WP02-12B.html;jsessionid=8E99F087A1E6FFEC3DBC59015C33BAF1|archivedate=2016-10-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other improvements, benefits and unique values of electronically publishing the scientific journal are easy availability of supplementary materials (data, graphics and video), lower cost, and availability to more people, especially scientists from non-developed countries. Hence, research results from more developed nations are becoming more accessible to scientists from non-developed countries.&lt;ref name=Heller/&gt;

Moreover, electronic publishing of scientific journals has been accomplished without compromising the standards of the refereed, [[peer review]] process.&lt;ref name=Heller&gt;

One form is the online equivalent of the conventional paper journal. By 2006, almost all scientific journals have, while retaining their peer-review process, established electronic versions; a number have moved entirely to electronic publication. In similar manner, most academic libraries buy the electronic version, and purchase a paper copy only for the most important or most-used titles.

There is usually a delay of several months after an article is written before it is published in a journal, making paper journals not an ideal format for announcing the latest research. Many journals now publish the final papers in their electronic version as soon as they are ready, without waiting for the assembly of a complete issue, as is necessary with paper. In many fields in which even greater speed is wanted, such as [[physics]], the role of the journal at disseminating the latest research has largely been replaced by [[preprint]] databases such as [[arXiv.org]]. Almost all such articles are eventually published in traditional journals, which still provide an important role in [[quality control]], archiving papers, and establishing scientific credit.

==Cost==
{{main article|Academic publishing#Publishers and business aspects}}
{{see also|Academic journal#Costs}}

Many scientists and librarians have long protested the cost of journals, especially as they see these payments going to large for-profit publishing houses&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mmm-online.com/channel/elsevier-begins-outreach-as-push-back-on-publisher-threatens-to-widen/article/225855/|title=Elsevier begins outreach as push-back on publisher threatens to widen|last=Weinstein|first=Deborah|date=1 Feb 2012|website=MM&amp;M|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215023645/https://www.mmm-online.com/channel/elsevier-begins-outreach-as-push-back-on-publisher-threatens-to-widen/article/225855/|archivedate=2018-02-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. To allow their researchers online access to journals, many universities purchase ''site licenses'', permitting access from anywhere in the university, and, with appropriate authorization, by university-affiliated users at home or elsewhere. These may be quite expensive, sometimes much more than the cost for a print subscription, although this may reflect the number of people who will be using the license—while a print subscription is the cost for one person to receive the journal; a site-license can allow thousands of people to gain access.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Publications by [[scholarly societies]], also known as not-for-profit-publishers, usually cost less than commercial publishers, but the prices of their scientific journals are still usually several thousand dollars a year. In general, this money is used to fund the activities of the scientific societies that run such journals, or is invested in providing further scholarly resources for scientists; thus, the money remains in and benefits the scientific sphere.

Despite the transition to electronic publishing, the [[serials crisis]] persists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Harvard University says it can't afford journal publishers' prices |first=Ian |last=Sample |journal=The Guardian |date=24 April 2012 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/apr/24/harvard-university-journal-publishers-prices |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161207164109/https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/apr/24/harvard-university-journal-publishers-prices |archivedate=7 December 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns about cost and open access have led to the creation of free-access journals such as the [[Public Library of Science]] (PLoS) family and partly open or reduced-cost journals such as the ''[[Journal of High Energy Physics]]''. However, professional editors still have to be paid, and PLoS still relies heavily on donations from foundations to cover the majority of its operating costs; smaller journals do not often have access to such resources.

Based on statistical arguments, it has been shown that electronic [[publishing]] online, and to some extent [[open access]], both provide wider dissemination and increase the average number of citations an article receives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/online-nature01/ |title=Online Or Invisible? |authorlink=Steve Lawrence (computer scientist) |first=Steve |last=Lawrence |publisher=[[NEC Research Institute]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316145522/http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/online-nature01/ |archivedate=2007-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright==
Traditionally, the author of an article was required to transfer the [[copyright]] to the journal publisher. Publishers claimed this was necessary in order to protect authors' rights, and to coordinate permissions for reprints or other use. However, many authors, especially those active in the [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] movement, found this unsatisfactory,&lt;ref name=Di_Cosmo&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have used their influence to effect a gradual move towards a license to publish instead. Under such a system, the publisher has permission to edit, print, and distribute the article commercially, but the authors retain the other rights themselves.

Even if they retain the copyright to an article, most journals allow certain rights to their authors. These rights usually include the ability to reuse parts of the paper in the author's future work, and allow the author to distribute a limited number of copies. In the print format, such copies are called reprints; in the electronic format, they are called [[postprints]]. Some publishers, for example the [[American Physical Society]], also grant the author the right to post and update the article on the author's or employer's website and on free e-print servers, to grant permission to others to use or reuse figures, and even to reprint the article as long as no fee is charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forms.aps.org/author/copyfaq.html |title=APS Copyright Policies and Frequently Asked Questions |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009083902/http://forms.aps.org/author/copyfaq.html |archivedate=2006-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of open access journals, in which the author retains the copyright but must pay a publication charge, such as the [[Public Library of Science]] family of journals, is another recent response to copyright concerns.&lt;ref&gt;[https://io9.gizmodo.com/5796054/is-it-time-to-end-copyright-for-scientific-journals Is it time to end copyright for scientific journals?] Gizmodo, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7027">'''Social journalism''' is a media model consisting of a hybrid of professional [[journalism]], contributor and reader content.&lt;ref name="Why Michael Wolff is Wrong"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sussman|first1=Ed|title=Why Michael Wolff is Wrong|url=http://observer.com/2014/03/why-michael-wolff-is-wrong/|accessdate=10 February 2015|publisher=New York Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to [[open publishing]] platforms, like [[Twitter]] and [[WordPress.com]], except that some or most content is also created and/or screened by professional journalists. Examples include [[Forbes#Forbes.com|Forbes.com]], [[Medium (service)|Medium]], [[BuzzFeed]], [https://www.sp-bx.com Soapbox] and [[Gawker Media|Gawker]]. The model, which in some instances has generated monthly audiences in the tens of millions, has been discussed as one way for professional journalism to thrive despite a marked decline in the audience for traditional journalism.&lt;ref name="Why Michael Wolff is Wrong"/&gt;

=="Platishing"==

Writing in [[Re/code]], Jonathan Glick, CEO of Sulia, said the model of publishers as platforms (which he calls a "platisher") is "on the rise". Glick cites as examples Medium (from Twitter co-founders [[Evan Williams (Internet entrepreneur)|Evan Williams]] and [[Biz Stone]]), [[Vox Media]], Sulia, Skift, [[First Look Media]] (backed by eBay founder [[Pierre Omidyar]]) and BuzzFeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Glick|first=Jonathan|title=Rise of the Platishers|url=http://recode.net/2014/02/07/rise-of-the-platishers/?hubRefSrc=permalink#lf_comment=136566982|work=Re/Code|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 12, 2014, Mark Little, the CEO of Storyful.com, now a division of News Corp., proposed "10 Principles that Power Social Journalism," including "UGC [User Generated Content] is governed by the same legal and ethical code as any other content" and "The currency of social journalism is authenticity not authority. We are not experts in every subject."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Little|first=Mark|title=10 Principles that Power Social Journalism|url=http://blog.storyful.com/2014/03/12/ten-principles-that-power-social-journalism/#.UzxieseT4aE|work=Storyful|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview in ''[[The New York Times]]'', the editor of ''[[The Guardian]]'', Alan Rusbridger, said the Guardian was in the process of converting into a platform as well as a publisher. "For years, news organizations had a quasi monopoly on information simply because we had the means of distribution. I think if as a journalist you are not intensely curious about what has been created by people who are not journalists, then you’re missing out on a lot," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chozik|first=Amy|title=The Guardian’s Alan Rusbridger: ‘It’s Essential to Be Paranoid’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/magazine/the-guardians-alan-rusbridger-its-essential-to-be-paranoid.html|work=New York Times Sunday Magazine|accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The new rules==

On April 1, 2014, in a column in [[GigaOM]] entitled "Social journalism and open platforms are the new normal — now we have to make them work" Mathew Ingram asked "How can media entities take advantage of this phenomenon without losing their way in the process?" and proceeded to review suggested rules for social journalism proposed by former FastCompany.com president Ed Sussman, an early adopter of the model.&lt;ref name="Ingram"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ingram|first=Mathew|title=Social Journalism and Open Platforms Are the New Normal - Now We Have to Make Them Work|url=http://gigaom.com/2014/04/01/social-journalism-and-open-platforms-are-the-new-normal-now-we-have-to-make-them-work/|work=Giga Om|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ingram summarized Sussman's suggestions, including clear labeling types of contributors (e.g. staff, guest contributor, reader contribution); establishing guidelines, such as conflict of interest rules, that posters must consent to before posting; providing wiki-like tools for social improvements to content; elevating the best content with curators and algorithms; deleting weak or problematic content via curators or algorithms.&lt;ref name="Ingram"/&gt;

Social journalism has been attacked by media critic Michael Wolff in ''[[USA Today]]'' as the "Forbes vanity model letting ‘contributors’ write whatever they want under your brand (‘as I wrote in Forbes …’) and not having to pay them anything — ultimately, of course, devaluing your authority." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolff|first=Michael|title=New cash, new questions for Business Insider|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/wolff/2014/03/16/the-future-of-business-insider/6370473/|work=USA Today|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a March 20, 2014 [[op-ed]] for ''[[The New York Observer]]'', former [[FastCompany.com]] president Ed Sussman argued that social journalism does not devalue the authority of brands and that the success of Forbes.com in attracting a wide audience with its 1,000+ bloggers proved that the model could be successful for traditional media companies.&lt;ref name="Why Michael Wolff is Wrong"/&gt; Following revelations that some [[Forbes.com]] contributors used their columns to allegedly participate in a "pump and dump" scheme to promote, then sell stocks, Sussman followed up with "The New Rules of Social Journalism: A Proposal" in [[Pando Daily]], on March 29, 2014. Sussman proposed various rules for elevating the quality and ethics of social journalism content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sussman|first=Ed|title=The New Rules of Social Journalism|url=http://pando.com/2014/03/29/the-new-rules-of-social-journalism-a-proposal/|work=Pando Daily|accessdate=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early adopter==

An early, or perhaps the first "social journalism" platform at a major media company was FastCompany.com, in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sussman|first=Ed|title=The Media is Social|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/665030/media-social/|work=FastCompany.com|accessdate=8 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the platform launched, in its first six months, FastCompany.com signed up 2,000 bloggers and 50,000 members.&lt;ref name="Why Michael Wolff is Wrong"/&gt; "Fast Company is the first, but certainly not last, mainstream publication to integrate the majority of their site as a social community," wrote media analyst Jeremiah Owyang in 2008, then a senior social computing analyst for [[Forrester Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Owyang|first=Jeremiah|title=An Initial Analysis of the Fast Company Community|url=http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/02/09/an-initial-analysis-of-the-fast-company-community/|work=Web Strategist|accessdate=20 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Ed Sussman left the website, the [[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] print magazine editors reverted it to a standard journalism website.&lt;ref name="Why Michael Wolff is Wrong"/&gt;

The '''Society for the History of Technology''', or '''SHOT''', is the primary professional society for historians of technology. SHOT was founded in 1958 in the United States, and it has since become an international society with members "from some thirty-five countries throughout the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Africa."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyoftechnology.org "Home," ''Society for the History of Technology (SHOT)'']&lt;/ref&gt; SHOT owes its existence largely to the efforts of Professor [[Melvin Kranzberg]] (1917-1995). SHOT co-founders include John B. Rae, [[Carl W. Condit]], [[Thomas P. Hughes]], and [[Eugene S. Ferguson]]. SHOT's flagship publication is the journal ''[[Technology and Culture]]'', published by the Johns Hopkins University Press. Kranzberg served as editor of ''Technology and Culture'' until 1981, and was succeeded as editor by Robert C. Post until 1995, and John M. Staudenmaier from 1996 until 2010. The current editor of ''Technology and Culture'' is Suzanne Moon at the University of Oklahoma. SHOT is an affiliate of the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] and the [[American Historical Association]] and publishes a joint booklet series with the AHA, "Historical Perspectives on Technology, Society, and Culture," under the co-editorship of [[Pamela O. Long]], Robert C. Post, and [[Asif Azam Siddiqi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyoftechnology.org/publications/booklets.html "Historical Perspectives," ''Society for the History of Technology (SHOT)'']&lt;/ref&gt; Pamela O. Long is the recipient of a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Foundation "Genius Grant"]] for 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/17/arts/macarthur-awards-go-to-21-diverse-fellows.html Felicia R. Lee, "MacArthur Awards Go to 21 Diverse Fellows," ''New York Times'', September 17, 2014,]&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of technology was traditionally linked to economic history and history of science, but its interactions are now equally strong with environmental history, gender history, business history, and labor history. SHOT annually awards two book prizes, the Edelstein Prize and the [https://www.historyoftechnology.org/about-us/awards-prizes-and-grants/the-sally-hacker-prize/ Sally Hacker Prize], as well as the Kranzberg Dissertation Fellowship and the Brooke Hindle Postdoctoral Fellowship.  Its highest award is the [[Leonardo da Vinci Medal]]. Recipients of the medal include Kranzberg, Ferguson, Post, Staudenmaier, Bart Hacker, and Brooke Hindle. In 1968 Kranzberg was also instrumental in the founding of a sister society, the International Committee for the History of Technology ([[ICOHTEC]]) in 1968. The two societies complement each other.

The Society for the History of Technology is dedicated to the historical study of technology and its relations with politics, economic, labor, business, the environment, public policy, science, and the arts. The society now numbers around 1500 members, and holds its meeting at a non-North-American venue every third year. SHOT also sponsors smaller conferences focused on specialized topics, often jointly with other scholarly societies and organizations.

'''Software documentation''' is written text or illustration that accompanies [[computer software]] or is embedded in the source code.  It either explains how it operates or how to use it, and may mean different things to people in different roles.

[[Documentation]] is an important part of [[software engineering]]. Types of documentation include:
# [[Requirement]]s – Statements that identify attributes, capabilities, characteristics, or qualities of a system.  This is the foundation for what will be or has been implemented.
# Architecture/Design – Overview of software. Includes relations to an environment and construction principles to be used in design of software components.
# Technical – Documentation of code, algorithms, interfaces, and [[API documentation|API]]s.
# [[End user]] – Manuals for the end-user, system administrators and support staff.
# Marketing – How to market the product and analysis of the market demand.

== Requirements documentation ==
[[Requirement]]s documentation is the description of what a particular [[software]] does or shall do. It is used throughout [[Software development|development]] to communicate how the software functions or how it is intended to operate. It is also used as an agreement or as the foundation for agreement on what the software will do. Requirements are produced and consumed by everyone involved in the production of software: [[end user]]s, [[customer]]s, [[product manager]]s, [[project manager]]s, [[sales]], [[marketing]], [[software architect]]s, [[usability engineering|usability engineers]], [[interaction design]]ers, [[software developer|developer]]s, and [[Software testing|testers]], to name a few. Thus, requirements documentation has many different purposes.

Requirements comes in a variety of styles, notations and formality. Requirements can be goal-like (e.g., ''distributed work environment''), close to design (e.g., ''builds can be started by right-clicking a configuration file and select the 'build' function''), and anything in between. They can be specified as statements in [[natural language]], as drawn figures, as detailed [[mathematical formula]]s, and as a combination of them all.

The variation and complexity of requirements documentation makes it a proven challenge. Requirements may be implicit and hard to uncover. It is difficult to know exactly how much and what kind of documentation is needed and how much can be left to the architecture and design documentation, and it is difficult to know how to document requirements considering the variety of people who shall read and use the documentation. Thus, requirements documentation is often incomplete (or non-existent). Without proper requirements documentation, software changes become more difficult — and therefore more error prone (decreased [[software quality]]) and time-consuming (expensive).

The need for requirements documentation is typically related to the complexity of the product, the impact of the product, and the [[Service life|life expectancy]] of the software. If the software is very complex or developed by many people (e.g., mobile phone software), requirements can help to better communicate what to achieve. If the software is safety-critical and can have negative impact on human life (e.g., nuclear power systems, medical equipment, mechanical equipment), more formal requirements documentation is often required. If the software is expected to live for only a month or two (e.g., very small mobile phone applications developed specifically for a certain campaign) very little requirements documentation may be needed. If the software is a first release that is later built upon, requirements documentation is very helpful when managing the change of the software and verifying that nothing has been broken in the software when it is modified.

Traditionally, requirements are specified in requirements documents (e.g. using word processing applications and spreadsheet applications). To manage the increased complexity and changing nature of requirements documentation (and software documentation in general), database-centric systems and special-purpose [[requirements management]] tools are advocated.

== Architecture design documentation ==
Architecture documentation (also known as [[software architecture description]]) is a special breed of design document. In a way, architecture documents are third derivative from the code ([[design document]] being second derivative, and code documents being first). Very little in the architecture documents is specific to the code itself. These documents do not describe how to program a particular routine, or even why that particular routine exists in the form that it does, but instead merely lays out the general requirements that would motivate the existence of such a routine. A good architecture document is short on details but thick on explanation. It may suggest approaches for lower level design, but leave the actual exploration trade studies to other documents.

Another breed of design docs is the comparison document, or trade study. This would often take the form of a ''[[whitepaper]]''. It focuses on one specific aspect of the system and suggests alternate approaches. It could be at the [[user interface]], code, design, or even architectural level. It will outline what the situation is, describe one or more alternatives, and enumerate the pros and cons of each. A good trade study document is heavy on research, expresses its idea clearly (without relying heavily on obtuse [[jargon]] to dazzle the reader), and most importantly is impartial. It should honestly and clearly explain the costs of whatever solution it offers as best. The objective of a trade study is to devise the best solution, rather than to push a particular point of view. It is perfectly acceptable to state no conclusion, or to conclude that none of the alternatives are sufficiently better than the baseline to warrant a change. It should be approached as a scientific endeavor, not as a marketing technique.

A very important part of the design document in enterprise software development is the Database Design Document (DDD). It contains Conceptual, Logical, and Physical Design Elements. The DDD includes the formal information that the people who interact with the database need. The purpose of preparing it is to create a common source to be used by all players within the scene. The potential users are:
*Database designer
*Database developer
*[[Database administrator]]
*Application designer
*[[Programmer|Application developer]]

When talking about [[Relational Database]] Systems, the document should include following parts:
*[[Entity–relationship model|Entity - Relationship Schema]] ([[Enhanced Entity-Relationship Model|enhanced]] or not), including following information and their clear definitions:
**Entity Sets and their attributes
**Relationships and their attributes
**Candidate keys for each entity set
**Attribute and Tuple based constraints
*Relational Schema, including following information:
**Tables, Attributes, and their properties
**Views
**Constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, 
**Cardinality of referential constraints
**Cascading Policy for referential constraints
**Primary keys

It is very important to include all information that is to be used by all actors in the scene. It is also very important to update the documents as any change occurs in the database as well.

== Technical documentation ==
{{Main article|Technical documentation}}
It is important for the code documents associated with the source code (which may include [[README]] files and [[API]] documentation) to be thorough, but not so verbose that it becomes overly time-consuming or difficult to maintain them. Various how-to and overview documentation guides are commonly found specific to the software application or software product being documented by [[API writer]]s. This documentation may be used by developers, testers, and also the end-users using the software application. Today, a lot of high-end applications in the field of power, energy, transportation, networks, aerospace, safety, security, industry automation and a variety of other domains are seen. Technical documentation has become important within such organizations as the basic and advanced level of information may change over a period of time with architecture changes.

Code documents are often organized into a ''reference guide'' style, allowing a programmer to quickly look up an arbitrary function or class.

=== Technical documentation embedded in source code ===

Often, [[Documentation generator|tools]] such as [[Doxygen]], [[NDoc]], [[Visual Expert]], [[Javadoc]], [[EiffelStudio]], [[Sandcastle (software)|Sandcastle]], [[ROBODoc]], [[Plain Old Documentation|POD]], [[TwinText]], or Universal Report can be used to auto-generate the code documents&amp;mdash;that is, they extract the comments and [[Design by Contract|software contracts]], where available, from the source code and create reference manuals in such forms as text or [[HTML]] files.

The idea of auto-generating documentation is attractive to programmers for various reasons.  For example, because it is extracted from the source code itself (for example, through [[comment (computer programming)|comment]]s), the programmer can write it while referring to the code, and use the same tools used to create the source code to make the documentation.  This makes it much easier to keep the documentation up-to-date.

Of course, a downside is that only programmers can edit this kind of documentation, and it depends on them to refresh the output (for example, by running a [[cron job]] to update the documents nightly). Some would characterize this as a pro rather than a con.

==== Literate programming ====
Respected computer scientist [[Donald Knuth]] has noted that documentation can be a very difficult afterthought process and has advocated [[literate programming]], written at the same time and location as the [[source code]] and extracted by automatic means. The programming languages [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and [[CoffeeScript]] have built-in support for a simple form of literate programming, but this support is not widely used.

==== Elucidative programming ====
Elucidative Programming is the result of practical applications of Literate Programming in real programming contexts. The Elucidative paradigm proposes that source code and documentation be stored separately.

Often, software developers need to be able to create and access information that is not going to be part of the source file itself. Such [[annotation]]s are usually part of several software development activities, such as code walks and porting, where third party source code is analysed in a functional way. Annotations can therefore help the developer during any stage of software development where a formal documentation system would hinder progress.

== User documentation ==
Unlike code documents, user documents simply describe how a program is used.

In the case of a [[Library (computing)|software library]], the code documents and user documents could in some cases be effectively equivalent and worth conjoining, but for a general application this is not often true.

Typically, the user documentation describes each feature of the program, and assists the user in realizing these features.  A good user document can also go so far as to provide thorough [[troubleshoot]]ing assistance.  It is very important for user documents to not be confusing, and for them to be up to date.  User documents don't need to be organized in any particular way, but it is very important for them to have a thorough [[Index (publishing)|index]]. Consistency and simplicity are also very valuable. User documentation is considered to constitute a contract specifying what the software will do. [[API Writer]]s are very well accomplished towards writing good user documents as they would be well aware of the software architecture and programming techniques used. See also [[technical writing]].

User documentation can be produced in a variety of online and print formats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2775457 RH Earle, MA Rosso, KE Alexander (2015) User preferences of software documentation genres. Proceedings of the 33rd Annual International Conference on the Design of Communication (ACM SIGDOC).]&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are three broad ways in which user documentation can be organized. 
# '''Tutorial:''' A [[tutorial]] approach is considered the most useful for a new user, in which they are guided through each step of accomplishing particular tasks.&lt;ref name=kdp&gt;{{cite web
  | last = Woelz 
  | first = Carlos

  | date = 
  | url = http://i18n.kde.org/docs/doc-primer/index.html
  | doi =
  | accessdate = 15 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# '''Thematic:''' A [[Theme (literature)|thematic]] approach, where chapters or sections concentrate on one particular area of interest, is of more general use to an intermediate user.  Some authors prefer to convey their ideas through a knowledge based article to facilitate the user needs.  This approach is usually practiced by a dynamic industry, such as [[Information technology]], where the user population is largely correlated with the [[troubleshooting]] demands &lt;ref name=kbad&gt;{{cite web
  | last = [[Microsoft]] 
  | first =

  | url = http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/driver/kernel/kb-drv.mspx
  | doi =
  | accessdate = 15 June 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''List or Reference:''' The final type of organizing principle is one in which commands or tasks are simply listed alphabetically or logically grouped, often via cross-referenced indexes. This latter approach is of greater use to advanced users who know exactly what sort of information they are looking for.

A common complaint among users regarding software documentation is that only one of these three approaches was taken to the near-exclusion of the other two. It is common to limit provided software documentation for [[personal computer]]s to [[online help]] that give only reference information on commands or menu items.  The job of tutoring new users or helping more experienced users get the most out of a program is left to private publishers, who are often given significant assistance by the software developer.

=== Composing user documentation ===
Like other forms of technical documentation, good user documentation benefits from an organized process of development. In the case of user documentation, the process as it commonly occurs in industry consists of five steps:&lt;ref&gt;Thomas T. Barker, [http://www.writingsoftwaredocumentation.com/index.htm Writing Software Documentation], Preface, xxiv. Part of the [[Allyn &amp; Bacon]] Series in Technical Communication, 2nd ed. [[Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|Upper Saddle River]]: [[Pearson Education]], 2003. {{ISBN|0321103289}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513033153/http://www.writingsoftwaredocumentation.com/index.htm |date=May 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

1. [[User analysis]], the basic research phase of the process.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, pg. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
2. '''Planning''', or the actual documentation phase.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, pg. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
3. '''Draft review''', a self-explanatory phase where feedback is sought on the draft composed in the previous step.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, pg. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
4. [[Usability testing]], whereby the usability of the document is tested empirically.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, pg. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
5. [[Editing]], the final step in which the information collected in steps three and four is used to produce the final draft.

== Documentation and agile development controversy ==
"The resistance to documentation among developers is well known and needs no emphasis."&lt;ref&gt;Herbsleb, James D. and Moitra, Dependra. In: ''IEEE Software'', vol. 18, no. 2, pp.  16-20, Mar/Apr 2001&lt;/ref&gt; 
This situation is particularly prevalent in [[agile software development]] because these methodologies try to avoid any unnecessary activities that do not directly bring value.
Specifically, the [[Agile Manifesto]] advocates valuing "working software over comprehensive documentation", which could be interpreted cynically as "We want to spend all our time coding. Remember, real programmers don't write documentation."&lt;ref&gt;Rakitin, Steven. , [http://csse.usc.edu/events/2002/arr/letters.pdf "Manifesto elicits cynicism."] IEEE Computer, vol. 34, no. 12, p. 4, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey among software engineering experts revealed, however, that documentation is by no means considered unnecessary in agile development.
Yet it is acknowledged that there are motivational problems in development, and that documentation methods tailored to agile development (e.g. through [[Reputation system]]s and [[Gamification]]) may be needed.&lt;ref&gt;Prause, Christian R., and Zoya Durdik. "Architectural design and documentation: Waste in agile development?" In: ''International Conference on Software and System Process'' (ICSSP), IEEE, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Selic, Bran. "Agile documentation, anyone?" In: ''IEEE Software'', vol. 26, no. 6, pp. 11-12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marketing documentation ==
For many applications it is necessary to have some promotional materials to encourage casual observers to spend more time learning about the product.  This form of documentation has three purposes:-

#To excite the potential user about the product and instill in them a desire for becoming more involved with it.
#To inform them about what exactly the product does, so that their expectations are in line with what they will be receiving.
#To explain the position of this product with respect to other alternatives.

'''System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)''' is a standard for automating the exchange of user identity information between identity domains, or IT systems.

For example, as a company hires and fires employees, they are added and removed from the company's electronic employee [[Directory service|directory]]. SCIM could be used to automatically add/delete (or, [[Provisioning#User provisioning|provision]]/de-provision) accounts for those users in external systems such as [[Google Apps for Work]], [[Office 365]], or [[Salesforce.com]]. Then, a new user account would exist in the external systems for each new employee, and the user accounts for former employees might no longer exist in those systems.

In addition to simple user-record management (creating &amp; deleting), SCIM can also be used to share information about user attributes, attribute schema, and group membership. Attributes could range from user contact information to group membership. Group membership or other attribute values are generally used to manage user permissions. Attribute values and group assignments can change, adding to the challenge of maintaining the relevant data across multiple identity domains.&lt;ref name="SCIM-19"&gt;{{cite book |author = Internet Engineering Task Force, Network Working Group|title = System for Cross-Domain Identity Management: Core Schema|version = Draft 19|date = May 11, 2015|url = http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-scim-core-schema-19|accessdate = 2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SCIM standard has grown in popularity and importance, as organizations use more SaaS tools.&lt;ref name="SCIMming" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SailPoint"&gt;{{cite press release | title = Identity Management Companies To Demonstrate Simple Cloud Identity Management (SCIM) Specification at Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) | publisher = SailPoint | date = October 18, 2011 | url = https://www.sailpoint.com/news/identity-management-companies-to-demonstrate-simple-cloud-identity-manageme | accessdate = May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large organization can have hundreds or thousands of hosted applications (internal and external) and related servers, databases and file shares that require user provisioning. Without a standard connection method, companies must write custom software connectors to join these systems and their IdM system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Grizzle | first = Kelly | title = SCIM: Provisioning users, killing connectors | journal = SecureID News | publisher = SecureID | date = March 10, 2014 | url = http://www.secureidnews.com/news-item/scim-provisioning-users-killing-connectors/  | accessdate = May 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SCIM uses a standardised [[API]] through [[REST]] with data formatted in [[JSON]] or [[XML]].&lt;ref name="SCIM-19" /&gt;

==History==
The first version, SCIM 1.0, was released in 2011 by a SCIM standard working group organized under the Open Web Foundation.&lt;ref name="simplecloud"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.simplecloud.info/#overview|title = SCIM Overview|accessdate = May 17, 2015|website = SimpleCloud.info| publisher = Simple Cloud Identity Management }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, it was transferred to the [[IETF]], and the current standard, SCIM 2.0 was released as [[Request for Comments|IETF RFC]] in 2015.&lt;ref name=SCIMming&gt;{{cite web |last= Wilson |first= Neil |id= (link: [https://www.unboundid.com/blog/author/neil-wilson neil-wilson]) |title= SCIMming along... |publisher= UnboundID blog |date= June 22, 2011 |url= https://www.unboundid.com/blog/2011/06/22/scimming-along |accessdate= May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Internet Engineering Task Force, Network Working Group |title= System for Cross-Domain Identity Management: Core Schema 1.1 | version= Version 1.1 |date= August 2, 2012 |url= https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-scim-core-schema-01 |accessdate= 2015-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SCIM 2.0 was completed in September 2015 and is published as IETF RFCs 7643&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7643 |title= System for Cross-domain Identity Management: Core Schema |date= September 2015 |website = ietf.org |publisher= Internet Engineering Task Force }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 7644.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644 |title= System for Cross-domain Identity Management: Protocol |date= September 2015 |website= ietf.org |publisher= Internet Engineering Task Force }}&lt;/ref&gt; A use-case document is also available as RFC7642.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7642 |title= System for Cross-domain Identity Management: Definitions, Overview, Concepts, and Requirements |date= September 2015 |website= ietf.org |publisher= Internet Engineering Task Force }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard has been implemented in various [[Identity management|IdM]] software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.simplecloud.info/#implementations|title= Known SCIM implementations |date= |website= SimpleCloud.info |publisher= Simple Cloud Identity Management }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard was initially called '''''Simple Cloud Identity Management''''' (as it is still called this in some places), but the name was officially changed to ''System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)'' when the IETF adopted it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Hunt |first= Phil |title= Standards Corner: SCIM and the Shifting Enterprise Identity Center of Gravity |website= Oracle Fusion Middleware (blog) |publisher= Oracle |date= February 27, 2014 |url = https://blogs.oracle.com/fusionmiddleware/entry/standards_corner_scim_and_the | accessdate= May 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Interoperability]] was demonstrated in October, 2011, at the Cloud Identity Summit, an [[Identity management|IAM]] industry conference. There, user accounts were provisioned and de-provisioned across separate systems using SCIM standards, by a collection of [[Identity management system|IdM software]] vendors: Okta, Ping Identity, SailPoint, Technology Nexus and UnboundID.&lt;ref name="SailPoint" /&gt; In March 2012, at IETF 83 in Paris, [[Interoperability]] tests continued by the same vendors, joined by [[Salesforce.com]], BCPSoft, WSO2, Gluu, and Courion (nine companies, total).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Logistics and attendee info for the March 20012 SCIM interop event | website = SCIM, Simple Cloud Identity Management | date = April 26, 2012 | url = https://code.google.com/p/scim/wiki/FirstInteropEvent | accessdate = May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SCIM is not the first standard for exchanging user data, but it builds on prior standards (e.g. SPML, [[Portable Contacts|PortableContacts]], [[vCard]]s, and [[LDAP Data Interchange Format|LDAP directory services]]) in an attempt to be a simpler and more widely adopted solution for cloud services providers.&lt;ref name="Ping-SCIM"&gt;{{cite web| title = SCIM: How It Works| website = PingIdentity.com| url = https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/articles/scim.html| format = Article| accessdate = May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SCIM-19-intro"&gt;{{cite book | author= Internet Engineering Task Force, Network Working Group | title = System for Cross-Domain Identity Management: Core Schema | version = Draft 19 | date = May 11, 2015 | section = Section 1, Introduction | url = http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-scim-core-schema-19#section-1 | accessdate = 2015-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Google]], [[Salesforce.com]], [[Cisco]], SailPoint and Ping Identity have been considered as the initial driving forces to create this open standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SCIMing the provisioning landscape|url = http://www.networkworld.com/article/2202653/access-control/sciming-the-provisioning-landscape.html|accessdate = 2015-06-23|first = Dave|last = Kearns|date = 2011-04-29|publisher = Network World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Technogaianism''' (a [[portmanteau]] word combining "techno-" for [[technology]] and "gaian" for [[Gaia philosophy]]) is a [[bright green environmentalist]] stance of active support for the research, development and use of [[emerging technologies|emerging and future technologies]] to help restore [[Earth]]'s [[Natural environment|environment]]. Technogaians argue that developing safe, [[clean technology|clean]], [[alternative technology]] should be an important goal of [[environmentalist]]s.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"&gt;{{cite book| author = Hughes, James| title = [[Citizen Cyborg]]: Why Democratic Societies Must Respond to the Redesigned Human of the Future| publisher = Westview Press| year = 2004| isbn = 0-8133-4198-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==

This point of view is different from the default position of [[Radical environmentalism|radical environmentalists]] and a common opinion that all technology necessarily degrades the environment, and that [[environmental restoration]] can therefore occur only with [[neo-luddism|reduced reliance on technology]]. Technogaians argue that technology gets cleaner and more efficient with time. They would also point to such things as [[hydrogen]] [[fuel cell]]s to demonstrate that developments do not have to come at the environment's expense. More directly, they argue that such things as [[nanotechnology]] and [[biotechnology]] can directly reverse [[environmental degradation]]. [[Molecular nanotechnology]], for example, could [[List of solid waste treatment technologies|convert garbage in landfills into useful materials and products]], while biotechnology could lead to novel [[List of nuclear waste treatment technologies|microbes that devour hazardous waste]].&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt;

While many environmentalists{{Who|date=January 2015}} still contend that ''most'' technology is detrimental to the environment, technogaians point out that it has been in humanity's best interests to exploit the environment mercilessly until fairly recently. This sort of behaviour follows accurately to current understandings of [[punctuated equilibrium|evolutionary systems]], in that when new factors (such as foreign [[species]] or [[mutant]] [[subspecies]]) are introduced into an [[ecosystem]], they tend to maximise their own [[resource consumption]] until either, ''a)'' they reach an equilibrium beyond which they cannot continue unmitigated growth, or ''b)'' they become extinct. In these models, it is ''completely impossible'' for such a factor to totally destroy its host environment, though they may precipitate [[ecological crisis|major ecological transformation]] before their ultimate eradication.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Technogaians believe humanity has currently reached just such a threshold, and that the only way for human civilization to continue advancing is to accept the tenets of technogaianism and limit future exploitive exhaustion of [[natural resource]]s and minimize further [[sustainable development|unsustainable development]] or face the widespread, ongoing [[Holocene extinction event|mass extinction of species]].&lt;ref name="Rosenzweig 2005"&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Michael Rosenzweig|Rosenzweig, Michael]]| title = Win-Win Ecology: How The Earth's Species Can Survive In The Midst of Human Enterprise| publisher = Clarendon Press| year = 2005| isbn = 0-19-515604-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The destructive effects of modern civilization can be mitigated by technological solutions, such as using nuclear power. Furthermore, technogaians argue that only science and technology can help humanity be aware of, and possibly develop counter-measures for, [[risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth]] such as a possible [[Asteroid impact avoidance|impact event]].&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt; 

Sociologist [[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]] mentions Walter Truett Anderson, author of ''To Govern Evolution: Further Adventures of the Political Animal'', as an example of a technogaian political philosopher;&lt;ref name="Anderson 1987"&gt;{{cite book| author = Anderson, Walter Truett| title = To Govern Evolution: Further Adventures of the Political Animal| publisher = Harcourt| year = 1987| isbn = 0-15-190483-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that technogaianism applied to [[environmental management]] is found in the [[reconciliation ecology]] writings such as [[Michael Rosenzweig]]'s ''Win-Win Ecology: How The Earth's Species Can Survive In The Midst of Human Enterprise'';&lt;ref name="Rosenzweig 2005"/&gt; and considers [[Bruce Sterling]]'s [[Viridian design movement]] to be an exemplary technogaian initiative.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sterling 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|    author = [[Bruce Sterling|Sterling, Bruce]] | title = Viridian: The Manifesto of January 3, 2000|    year = 2001 | url = http://www.viridiandesign.org/manifesto.html| accessdate=2007-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theories of English writer Fraser Clark may be broadly categorised as technogaian.{{according to whom|date=December 2014}} Clark advocated "balancing the hippie right brain with the techno left brain". The idea of combining technology and ecology were extrapolated at length by a South African eco-anarchist project in the 1990s. The [[Kagenna Magazine]] project aimed to combine technology, art and ecology in an emerging movement that could restore the balance between human and nature.

[[George Dvorsky]] suggests the sentiment of technogaianism is to heal the Earth, use [[sustainable technology]], and create ecologically diverse environments.&lt;ref name = dvorsky&gt;[http://www.sentientdevelopments.com/2013/02/7-best-case-scenarios-for-future-of.html?spref=tw George Dvorsky, 7 Best-Case Scenarios for the Future of Humanity, Sentient Developments, (Feb. 2, 2013).]&lt;/ref&gt; Dvorsky argues that defensive counter measures could be designed to counter the harmful effects of asteroid impacts, [[earthquakes]], and  [[Types of volcanic eruptions|volcanic eruptions]].&lt;ref name = dvorsky/&gt; Dvorksky also suggest that genetic engineering could be used to reduce the environmental impact humans have on the earth.&lt;ref name = dvorsky/&gt;

Technology facilities the sampling, testing and monitoring of various environments and ecosystems.  NASA uses space-based observations to conduct research on solar activity, sea level rise, the temperature of the atmosphere and the oceans, the state of the ozone layer, air pollution, and changes in sea ice and land ice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://climate.nasa.gov/nasa_role/ Global Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet: NASA's Role, Taking a global perspective on Earth's climate]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geoengineering===
{{See also|Climate engineering}}

Climate engineering is a technogaian method that uses two categories of technologies- [[carbon dioxide removal]] and [[solar radiation management]]. Carbon dioxide removal addresses a cause of climate change by removing one of the [[greenhouse gases]] from the [[atmosphere]]. Solar radiation management attempts to offset effects of greenhouse gases by causing the [[Earth]] to absorb less [[solar radiation]].

[[Earthquake engineering]] is a technogaian method concerned with protecting society and the natural and man-made environment from earthquakes by limiting the seismic risk to acceptable levels.&lt;ref name=Bozorgnia2004&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another example of a technogaian practice is an artificial [[closed ecological system]] used to test if and how people could live and work in a closed [[biosphere]], while carrying out [[scientific experiment]]s. It is in some cases used to explore the possible use of closed biospheres in [[space colonization]], and also allows the study and manipulation of a biosphere without harming Earth's.&lt;ref name="Gitelson, Livovsky &amp; MacElroy 2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gitelson, I.

===Genetic engineering===
{{See also|Genetic engineering|Genetically modified food controversies}}
S. Matthew Liao, professor of philosophy and bioethics at [[New York University]], claims that the [[human impact on the environment]] could be reduced by [[Gene therapy|genetically engineering humans]] to have, a smaller stature, an intolerance to eating meat, and an increased ability to see in the dark, thereby using less lighting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/03/how-engineering-the-human-body-could-combat-climate-change/253981/ Ross Anderson, How Engineering the Human Body Could Combat Climate Change, The Atlantic, (March 12, 2012).]&lt;/ref&gt; Liao argues that human engineering is less risky than [[climate engineering|geoengineering]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smatthewliao.com/2012/02/09/human-engineering-and-climate-change/ S. Mathew Liao, Human Engineering and Climate Change, (Feb. 12, 2012).]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Genetically modified food]]s have reduced the amount of [[herbicide]] and [[insecticide]] needed for cultivation. The development of glyphosate-resistant ([[Roundup Ready]]) plants has changed the herbicide use profile away from more environmentally persistent herbicides with higher toxicity, such as [[atrazine]], [[metribuzin]] and [[alachlor]], and reduced the volume and danger of herbicide runoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18268303 | doi=10.2134/jeq2006.0540 | volume=37 | issue=2 | year=2008 | pages=401–8 |vauthors=Shipitalo MJ, Malone RW, Owens LB | title = Impact of Glyphosate-Tolerant Soybean and Glufosinate-Tolerant Corn Production on Herbicide Losses in Surface Runoff | journal = Journal of Environment Quality| url=https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/naldc/download.xhtml?id=21799&amp;content=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Technology readiness levels''' ('''TRL''') are a method of estimating [[technology maturity]] of Critical Technology Elements (CTE) of a program during the acquisition process. They are determined during a Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) that examines program concepts, technology requirements, and demonstrated technology capabilities.  TRL are based on a scale from 1 to 9 with 9 being the most mature technology. The use of TRLs enables consistent, uniform discussions of technical maturity across different types of technology. TRL has been in widespread use at [[NASA]] since the 1980s where it was originally invented&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. In 1999 the [[United States Department of Defense|US Department of Defense]] was advised by [[Government Accountability Office|GAO]] to use the scale for procurement which it did from the early 2000s.  By 2008 the scale was also in use at the [[European Space Agency|European Space Agency (ESA)]] as it is evidenced by their [https://artes.esa.int/sites/default/files/TRL_Handbook.pdf handbook]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. The [[European Commission]] advised EU-funded research and innovation projects to adopt the scale in 2010&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which they did from 2014 in its [https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/ Horizon 2020] [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development|program]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. In 2013 TRL was further canonized by the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 16290:2013 standard&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. A comprehensive approach and discussion about TRLs has been published by the European Association of Research and Technology Organisations ([http://www.earto.eu/ EARTO]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earto.eu/fileadmin/content/03_Publications/The_TRL_Scale_as_a_R_I_Policy_Tool_-_EARTO_Recommendations_-_Final.pdf The TRL scale as a Research &amp; Innovation Policy Tool]&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive criticism of the adoption of TRL scale by the European Union was published in The Innovation Journal, in that "concreteness and sophistication of the TRL scale gradually diminished as its usage spread outside its original context (space programs)".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==

Technology Readiness Levels were originally conceived at NASA in 1974 and formally defined in 1989. The original definition included seven levels, but in the 1990s NASA adopted the current nine-level scale that subsequently gained widespread acceptance.&lt;ref name="TRL Demystified"&gt;{{cite web|title = Technology Readiness Levels Demystified|author=Banke, Jim |date = 20 August 2010 |url = http://www.nasa.gov/topics/aeronautics/features/trl_demystified.html|publisher = [[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TRL methodology was originated by Stan Sadin at NASA Headquarters in 1974.&lt;ref name="TRL Demystified"/&gt; At that time, Ray Chase was the JPL Propulsion Division representative on the Jupiter Orbiter design team. At the suggestion of Stan Sadin, Mr Chase used this methodology to assess the technology readiness of the proposed JPL Jupiter Orbiter spacecraft design.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Later Mr Chase spent a year at NASA Headquarters helping Mr Sadin institutionalize the TRL methodology. Mr Chase joined ANSER in 1978, where he used the TRL methodology to evaluate the technology readiness of proposed Air Force development programs.

The [[United States Air Force]] adopted the use of Technology Readiness Levels in the 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

In 1995, [[John C. Mankins]], NASA, wrote a paper&lt;ref name="Mankins"&gt;[http://www.nss.org/settlement/ssp/library/2000-testimony-JohnMankins.htm Statement of John C. Mankins] U.S. House Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics Committee on Science, Sep 7, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; that discussed NASA's use of TRLs and proposed expanded descriptions for each TRL. In 1999, the United States [[General Accounting Office]] produced an influential report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Best Practices: Better Management of Technology Can Improve Weapon System Outcomes (GAO/NSIAD-99-162)|date = July 1999 |url = http://www.gao.gov/archive/1999/ns991620.pdf|publisher = [[General Accounting Office]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; that examined the differences in [[technology transfer|technology transition]] between the DOD and private industry. It concluded that the DOD takes greater risks and attempts to transition emerging technologies at lesser degrees of maturity than does private industry. The GAO concluded that use of immature technology increased overall program risk. The GAO recommended that the DOD make wider use of Technology Readiness Levels as a means of assessing technology maturity prior to transition. In 2001, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Science and Technology issued a memorandum that endorsed use of TRLs in new major programs. Guidance for assessing technology maturity was incorporated into the ''Defense Acquisition Guidebook''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://at.dod.mil/docs/DefenseAcquisitionGuidebook.pdf ''Defense Acquisition Guidebook''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425232741/http://at.dod.mil/docs/DefenseAcquisitionGuidebook.pdf |date=2012-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the DOD developed detailed guidance for using TRLs in the 2003 DOD Technology Readiness Assessment Deskbook.

=== TRL in the European Union&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mihaly|first=Heder|date=September 2017|title=From NASA to EU: the evolution of the TRL scale in Public Sector Innovation|url=https://www.innovation.cc/discussion-papers/22_2_3_heder_nasa-to-eu-trl-scale.pdf|journal=The Innovation Journal|volume=22|pages=1–23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011071816/https://www.innovation.cc/discussion-papers/22_2_3_heder_nasa-to-eu-trl-scale.pdf|archive-date=October 11, 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
The European Space Agency adopted the TRL scale in the mid-2000s.

==Assessment tools==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:TPMM Process Icon.jpg]] --&gt;[[Image:TPMM transition mech.jpg|right|300px|TPMM Transition Mechanism]]

A ''Technology Readiness Level Calculator'' was developed by the [[United States Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Nolte, William L.|title = ''Technology Readiness Level Calculator, Air Force Research Laboratory'', presented at the NDIA Systems Engineering Conference |date = 20 October 2003|url = http://www.dtic.mil/ndia/2003systems/nolte.ppt|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tool is a standard set of questions implemented in [[Microsoft Excel]] that produces a graphical display of the TRLs achieved. This tool is intended to provide a snapshot of technology maturity at a given point in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Technology Assessment Calculator|url = https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=320594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Technology Program Management Model'' was developed by the [[United States Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Craver, Jeffrey T.|title = ''Technology Program Management Model, Army Space and Missile Defense Command Technical Center'', presented at the NDIA Systems Engineering Conference |date = 26 October 2006|url = http://www.dtic.mil/ndia/2006systems/Thursday/crave.pdf|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TPMM is a TRL-gated high-fidelity activity model that provides a flexible management tool to assist Technology Managers in planning, managing, and assessing their technologies for successful technology transition.  The model provides a core set of activities including [[systems engineering]] and [[program management]] tasks that are tailored to the technology development and management goals.  This approach is comprehensive, yet it consolidates the complex activities that are relevant to the development and transition of a specific technology program into one integrated model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ''TPMM - Technology Program Management Model'' (only available to DOD components)|url = https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=148163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

The primary purpose of using technology readiness levels is to help management in making decisions concerning the development and transitioning of technology. It should be viewed as one of several tools that are needed to manage the progress of research and development activity within an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Christophe Deutsch|author2 = Chiara Meneghini|author3 = Ozzy Mermut|author4 = Martin Lefort|title = Measuring Technology Readiness to improve Innovation Management|accessdate = 2011-11-27|url = http://www.ino.ca/Docs/Documents/publications/scientifiques/Deutch_Measuring%20technology%20readiness%20to%20improve%20innovation%20management.pdf|publisher = INO|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120602044401/http://www.ino.ca/Docs/Documents/publications/scientifiques/Deutch_Measuring%20technology%20readiness%20to%20improve%20innovation%20management.pdf|archivedate = 2012-06-02|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the advantages of TRLs:&lt;ref name="hfidtc"&gt;{{cite web|author = Ben Dawson|title = The Impact of Technology Insertion on Organisations|date = 31 October 2007|url = http://www.hfidtc.com/research/process/reports/phase-2/HFIDTC-2-12-2-1-1-tech-organisation.pdf|publisher = Human Factors Integration Design Technology Centre|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120426001612/http://www.hfidtc.com/research/process/reports/phase-2/HFIDTC-2-12-2-1-1-tech-organisation.pdf|archivedate = 26 April 2012|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Provides a common understanding of technology status
* Risk management
* Used to make decisions concerning technology funding
* Used to make decisions concerning transition of technology

Some of the characteristics of TRLs that limit their utility:&lt;ref name ="hfidtc" /&gt;

* Readiness does not necessarily fit with appropriateness or technology maturity
* A mature product may possess a greater or lesser degree of readiness for use in a particular system context than one of lower maturity
* Numerous factors must be considered, including the relevance of the products' operational environment to the system at hand, as well as the product-system architectural mismatch

Current TRL models tend to disregard negative and obsolescence factors. There have been suggestions made for incorporating such factors into assessments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Ricardo Valerdi|author2 = Ron J. Kohl|title = ''An Approach to Technology Risk Management'', Engineering Systems Division Symposium MIT, Cambridge, MA, March 29-31, 2004 |date = March 2004|url = http://web.mit.edu/rvalerdi/www/TRL%20paper%20ESD%20Valerdi%20Kohl.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For complex technologies that incorporate various development stages, a more detailed scheme called the Technology Readiness Pathway Matrix has been developed going from basic units to applications in society. This tool aims to show that a readiness level of a technology is based on a less linear process but on a more complex pathway through its application in society.. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Vincent Jamier|author2 = Christophe Aucher|title = ''Demystifying Technology Readiness Levels for Complex Technologies'', Leitat, Barcelona, April 24, 2018 |date = April 2018|url = https://projects.leitat.org/demystifying-trls-for-complex-technologies/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 28th century BC &amp;mdash; [[Ancient Egypt]]ian texts describe [[electric fish]]. They refer to them as the "Thunderer of the [[Nile]]", and described them as the "protectors" of all other fish.&lt;ref name="moller"&gt;{{citation|title=Review: Electric Fish|first=Peter|last=Moller|journal=BioScience|volume=41|issue=11|date=December 1991|pages=794–6 [794]|doi=10.2307/1311732|jstor=1311732|last2=Kramer|first2=Bernd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 6th century BC &amp;mdash; [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] philosopher [[Thales of Miletus]] observes that rubbing fur on various substances, such as [[amber]], would cause an attraction between the two, which is now known to be caused by [[static electricity]]. He noted that the amber buttons could attract light objects such as hair and that if the amber was rubbed sufficiently a spark would jump.
* 424 BC [[Aristophanes]] "lens" is a glass globe filled with water.([[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] says that it can be used to read letters ''no matter how small or dim'')&lt;ref name=King&gt;''The history of the telescope'' by Henry C.

* 3rd century BC [[Euclid]] is the first to write about reflection and refraction and notes that light travels in straight lines&lt;ref name=King/&gt;
* 3rd century BC &amp;mdash; The [[Baghdad Battery]] is dated from this period. It resembles a [[galvanic cell]] and is believed by some to have been used for [[electroplating]], although there is no common consensus on the purpose of these devices nor whether they were, indeed, even electrical in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2804257.stm |first=Arran |last=Frood  |title=Riddle of 'Baghdad's batteries' |newspaper=BBC News |date=27 February 2003 |accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1st century BC &amp;mdash; Pliny in his Natural History records the story of a shepherd Magnes who discovered the magnetic properties of some iron stones, "''it is said, made this discovery, when, upon taking his herds to pasture, he found that the nails of his shoes and the iron ferrel of his staff adhered to the ground.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-eng1:1.dedication |author=Pliny the Elder |title=The Natural History |chapter=Dedication|series=Perseus Collection: Greek and Roman Materials|publisher=Department of the Classics, Tufts University |accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 130 AD. &amp;mdash; [[Ptolemy|Claudius Ptolemy]] (in his work ''Optics'') wrote about the properties of [[light]] including: [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]], [[refraction]], and [[color]] and tabulated [[angle]]s of [[refraction]] for several media
* 8th century AD &amp;mdash; Electric fish are reported by [[Islamic geography|Arabic naturalists]] and [[Islamic medicine|physicians]].&lt;ref name="moller"/&gt;
* 1021 &amp;mdash; [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) writes the ''[[Book of Optics]]'', studying  [[Visual perception|vision]].

* 1305 &amp;mdash; [[Dietrich von Freiberg]] uses crystalline spheres and flasks filled with water to study the [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] and refraction in raindrops that leads to primary and secondary [[rainbow]]s
* 14th century AD &amp;mdash; Possibly the earliest and nearest approach to the discovery of the identity of [[lightning]], and [[electricity]] from any other source, is to be attributed to the [[Arabs]], who before the 15th century had the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for lightning (''raad'') applied to the [[electric ray]].&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana"&gt;''The [[Encyclopedia Americana]]; a library of universal knowledge'' (1918), [[New York City|New York]]: Encyclopedia Americana Corp.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1550 &amp;mdash; [[Gerolamo Cardano]] writes about electricity in ''De Subtilitate'' distinguishing, perhaps for the first time, between electrical and magnetic forces.

==17th century==
* 1600 &amp;mdash; [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] publishes ''De Magnete, Magneticisque Corporibus, et de Magno Magnete Tellure'' ("On the Magnet and Magnetic bodies, and on that Great Magnet the Earth"), Europe's then current standard on electricity and magnetism. He experimented with and noted the different character of electrical and magnetic forces. In addition to known ancient Greeks' observations of the electrical properties of rubbed amber, he experimented with a needle balanced on a pivot, and found that the needle was non-directionally affected by many materials such as alum, arsenic, hard resin, [[Jet (lignite)|jet]], glass, gum-mastic, mica, rock-salt, sealing wax, slags, sulfur, and precious stones such as amethyst, [[beryl]], diamond, opal, and sapphire. He noted that electrical charge could be stored by covering the body with a non-conducting substance such as silk. He described the method of artificially magnetizing iron. His [[terrella]] (little earth), a sphere cut from a lodestone on a metal lathe, modeled the earth as a lodestone (magnetic iron ore) and demonstrated that every lodestone has fixed poles, and how to find them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Henry Smith |last=Williams |title=A history of science |volume=2 |url=http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/sci/history/AHistoryofScienceVolumeII/chap18.html |chapter=Part IV.

He experimented with such physical models in an attempt to explain problems in [[navigation]] due varying properties of the [[magnetic compass]] with respect to their location on the earth, such as [[magnetic declination]] and magnetic inclination. His experiments explained the [[Dip circle|dipping of the needle]] by the magnetic attraction of the earth, and were used to predict where the vertical dip would be found. Such magnetic inclination was described as early as the 11th century by [[Shen Kuo]] in his ''Meng Xi Bi Tan'' and further investigated in 1581 by retired mariner and [[Compasssmith|compass maker]] [[Robert Norman]], as described in his pamphlet, ''The Newe Attractive.'' The gilbert, a unit of [[magnetomotive force]] or [[magnetic potential]], was named in his honor.

* 1705 &amp;mdash; [[Francis Hauksbee (scientist)|Francis Hauksbee]] improves von Guericke's [[electrostatic generator]] by using a glass globe and generates the first sparks by approaching his finger to the rubbed globe.
* 1728 &amp;mdash; [[James Bradley]] discovers the [[Aberration of light|aberration]] of starlight and uses it to determine that the [[speed of light]] is about 283,000 [[kilometre|km]]/[[second|s]]
* 1729 &amp;mdash; [[Stephen Gray (scientist)|Stephen Gray]] and the Reverend [[Granville Wheler]] experiment to discover that electrical "virtue," produced by rubbing a glass tube, could be transmitted over an extended distance (nearly 900&amp;nbsp;ft (about 270&amp;nbsp;m)) through thin iron wire using silk threads as insulators, to deflect leaves of brass. This has been described as the beginning of electrical communication.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=David H.|last2=Clark|first2=Stephen P.H.|title=Newton's tyranny : the suppressed scientific discoveries of Stephen Gray and John Flamsteed|date=2001|publisher=Freeman|location=New York|isbn=9780716747017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}} This was also the first distinction between the roles of conductors and insulators (names applied by [[John Theophilus Desaguliers|John Desaguliers]], mathematician and [[Royal Society]] member, who stated that Gray "has made greater variety of electrical experiments than all the philosophers of this and the last age.")&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}} Georges-Louis LeSage built a [[electrical telegraph|static electricity telegraph]] in 1774, based upon the same principles discovered by Gray.
* 1732 &amp;mdash; [[C. F. du Fay]] Shows that all objects, except metals, animals, and liquids, can be electrified by rubbing them and that metals, animals and liquids could be electrified by means of an electrostatic generators
* 1734 &amp;mdash; [[C. F. du Fay|Charles François de Cisternay DuFay]] (inspired by Gray's work to perform electrical experiments) dispels the effluvia theory by his paper in Volume 38 of the ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society,'' describing his discovery of the distinction between two kinds of electricity: "resinous," produced by rubbing bodies such as amber, copal, or [[Lac|gum-lac]] with silk or paper, and "vitreous," by rubbing bodies as glass, rock crystal, or precious stones with hair or wool. He also posited the principle of mutual attraction for unlike forms and the repelling of like forms and that "from this principle one may with ease deduce the explanation of a great number of other phenomena." The terms resinous and vitreous were later replaced with the terms "positive" and "negative" by [[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]] and Benjamin Franklin.
* 1737 &amp;mdash; [[C. F. du Fay]] and [[Francis Hauksbee the younger]]{{fact|date=May 2013}} independently discover two kinds of frictional electricity: one generated from rubbing glass, the other from rubbing resin (later identified as positive and negative electrical charges).
* 1740 &amp;mdash; [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]], in ''Mémoire sur la réfraction des corps solides'', explains the process of [[refraction]].
* 1745 &amp;mdash; [[Pieter van Musschenbroek]] of Leiden (Leyden) independently discovers the [[Leyden jar|Leyden (Leiden) jar]], a primitive [[capacitor]] or "condenser" (term coined by Volta in 1782, derived from the Italian ''condensatore''), with which the transient electrical energy generated by current friction machines could now be stored. He and his student Andreas Cunaeus used a glass jar filled with water into which a brass rod had been placed. He charged the jar by touching a wire leading from the electrical machine with one hand while holding the outside of the jar with the other. The energy could be discharged by completing an external circuit between the brass rod and another conductor, originally his hand, placed in contact with the outside of the jar. He also found that if the jar were placed on a piece of metal on a table, a shock would be received by touching this piece of metal with one hand and touching the wire connected to the electrical machine with the other.
* 1745 &amp;mdash; [[Ewald Georg von Kleist]] of independently invents the capacitor: a glass jar coated inside and out with metal. The inner coating was connected to a rod that passed through the lid and ended in a metal sphere. By having this thin layer of glass insulation (a [[dielectric]]) between two large, closely spaced plates, von Kleist found the energy density could be increased dramatically compared with the situation with no insulator. [[Daniel Gralath]] improved the design and was also the first to combine several jars to form a battery strong enough to kill birds and small animals upon discharge.
* 1746 &amp;mdash; [[Leonhard Euler]] develops the wave theory of light refraction and dispersion
* 1747 &amp;mdash; [[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]], while experimenting with a Leyden jar, observes that a discharge of static electricity causes [[electric current]] to flow and develops the concept of an electrical potential ([[voltage]]).
* 1752 &amp;mdash; [[Benjamin Franklin]] establishes the link between lightning and electricity by the flying a kite into a thunderstorm and transferring some of the charge into a Leyden jar and showed that its properties were the same as charge produced by an electrical machine. He is credited with utilizing the concepts of positive and negative charge in the explanation of then known electrical phenomenon. He theorized that there was an electrical fluid (which he proposed could be the [[Luminiferous ether#The history of light and aether|luminiferous ether]], which was used by others before and after him, to explain the [[Light#Wave_theor|wave theory of light]]) that was part of all material and all intervening space. The charge of any object would be neutral if the concentration of this fluid were the same both inside and outside of the body, positive if the object contained an excess of this fluid, and negative if there were a deficit. In 1749 he had documented the similar properties of lightning and electricity, such as that both an [[electric spark]] and a lightning flash produced [[light]] and sound, could kill animals, cause fires, melt metal, destroy or reverse the polarity of magnetism, and flowed through conductors and could be concentrated at sharp points. He was later able to apply the property of concentrating at sharp points by his invention of the lightning rod, for which he intentionally did not profit. He also investigated the Leyden jar, proving that the charge was stored on the glass and not in the water, as others had assumed.
* 1753 &amp;mdash; C. M. (of Scotland, possibly Charles Morrison, of Greenock or Charles Marshall, of Aberdeen)  proposes in the 17 February edition of Scots Magazine, an electrostatic telegraph system with 26 insulated wires, each corresponding to a letter of the alphabet and each connected to electrostatic machines.

* 1786 &amp;mdash; [[Luigi Galvani]] discovers "animal electricity" and postulates that animal bodies are storehouses of electricity. His invention of the voltaic cell leads to the invention the electric battery.
* 1791 &amp;mdash; [[Luigi Galvani]] discovers galvanic electricity and [[bioelectricity]] through experiments following an observation that touching exposed muscles in frogs' legs with a scalpel which had been close to a static electrical machine caused them to jump. He called this "animal electricity". Years of experimentation in the 1780s eventually led him to the construction of an arc of two different metals (copper and zinc for example) by connecting the two metal pieces and then connecting their open ends across the nerve of a frog leg, producing the same muscular contractions (by completing a circuit) as originally accidentally observed. The use of different metals to produce an electrical spark is the basis that led Alessandro Volta in 1799 to his invention of his voltaic pile, which eventually became the [[Battery (electricity)|galvanic battery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Henry Smith |last=Williams |title=A history of science |volume=3|url=http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/sci/history/AHistoryofScienceVolumeIII/chap46.html |chapter=VII.

* 1799 &amp;mdash; [[Alessandro Volta]], following Galvani's discovery of galvanic electricity, creates a [[voltaic pile|voltaic cell]] producing an electric current by the chemical action of several pairs of alternating copper (or silver) and zinc discs "piled" and separated by cloth or cardboard which had been soaked brine (salt water) or acid to increase conductivity. In '''1800''' he demonstrates the production of light from a glowing wire conducting electricity. This was followed in 1801 by his construction of the first [[electric battery]], by utilizing multiple voltaic cells. Prior to his major discoveries, in a letter of praise to the Royal Society 1793, Volta reported Luigi Galvani's experiments of the 1780s as the "most beautiful and important discoveries," regarding them as the foundation of future discoveries. Volta's inventions led to revolutionary changes with this method of the production of inexpensive, controlled electric current vs. existing frictional machines and Leyden jars. The electric battery became standard equipment in every experimental laboratory and heralded an age of practical applications of electricity.&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}} The unit [[volt]] is named for his contributions.

* 1818 &amp;mdash; [[François Jean Dominique Arago]] verifies the existence of the Poisson-Arago  bright spot
* 1820 &amp;mdash; [[Hans Christian Ørsted]], Danish physicist and chemist, unites the separate sciences of electricity and magnetism. He develops an experiment in which he notices a compass needle is deflected from [[Magnetic declination|magnetic north]] when an electric current from the battery he was using was switched on and off, convincing him that magnetic fields radiate from all sides of a live wire just as light and heat do, confirming a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism. He also observes that the movement of the compass-needle to one side or the other depends upon the direction of the current. Following intensive investigations, he published his findings, proving that a changing electric current produces a magnetic field as it flows through a wire. The [[oersted]] unit of magnetic induction is named for his contributions.
* 1820 &amp;mdash; [[André-Marie Ampère]], professor of mathematics at the Ecole Polytechnique, a short time after learning of Ørsted's discovery that a magnetic needle is acted on by a voltaic current, conducts experiments and publishes a paper in ''[[Annales de Chimie et de Physique]]'' attempting to give a combined theory of electricity and magnetism. He shows that a coil of wire carrying a current behaves like an ordinary magnet and suggests that electromagnetism might be used in telegraphy. He mathematically develops [[Ampère's force law|Ampère's law]] describing the magnetic force between two electric currents. His mathematical theory explains known electromagnetic phenomena and predicts new ones. His laws of electrodynamics include the facts that parallel conductors currying current in the same direction attract and those carrying currents in the opposite directions repel one another. One of the first to develop electrical measuring techniques, he built an instrument utilizing a free-moving needle to measure the flow of electricity, contributing to the development of the [[galvanometer]]. In '''1821''', he proposed a telegraphy system utilizing one wire per "galvanometer" to indicate each letter, and reported experimenting successfully with such a system. However, in '''1824''', [[Peter Barlow (mathematician)|Peter Barlow]] reported its maximum distance was only 200 feet, and so was impractical.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In '''1826''' he publishes the ''Memoir on the Mathematical Theory of Electrodynamic Phenomena, Uniquely Deduced from Experience'' containing a mathematical derivation of the electrodynamic force law. Following Faraday's discovery of  electromagnetic induction in 1831, Ampère agreed that Faraday deserved full credit for the discovery.
* 1820 &amp;mdash; [[Johann Salomo Christoph Schweigger]], German chemist, physicist, and professor, builds the first sensitive galvanometer, wrapping a coil of wire around a graduated compass, an acceptable instrument for actual measurement as well as detection of small amounts of electric current, naming it after Luigi Galvani.
* 1821 &amp;mdash; [[André-Marie Ampère]] announces his theory of electrodynamics, predicting the force that one current exerts upon another.
* 1821 &amp;mdash; [[Thomas Johann Seebeck]] discovers the [[thermoelectric effect]].
* 1821 &amp;mdash; [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] derives a mathematical demonstration that polarization can be explained only if light is ''entirely'' transverse, with no longitudinal vibration whatsoever.
* 1825 &amp;mdash; [[Augustin Fresnel]] phenomenologically explains optical activity by introducing circular birefringence
* 1825 &amp;mdash; [[William Sturgeon]], founder of the first English Electric Journal, ''Annals of Electricity'', found that an iron core inside a helical coil of wire connected to a battery greatly increased the resulting magnetic field, thus making possible the more powerful [[electromagnet]]s utilizing a [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] core. Sturgeon also bent the iron core into a U-shape to bring the poles closer together, thus concentrating the magnetic field lines. These discoveries followed Ampère's discovery that electricity passing through a coiled wire produced a magnetic force and that of [[François Arago|Dominique François Jean Arago]] finding that an iron bar is magnetized by putting it inside the coil of current-carrying wire, but Arago had not observed the increased strength of the resulting field while the bar was being magnetized.
* 1826 &amp;mdash; [[Georg Simon Ohm]] states his [[Ohm's law]] of [[electrical resistance]] in the journals of Schweigger and Poggendorff, and also published in his landmark pamphlet ''Die galvanische Kette mathematisch bearbeitet'' in '''1827'''. The unit [[ohm (unit)|ohm]] (Ω) of electrical resistance has been named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juliantrubin.com/bigten/ohmlawexperiments.html |title=Georg Simon Ohm: The Discovery of Ohm's Law |publisher=Juliantrubin.com |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1829 &amp; 1830 &amp;mdash; [[Francesco Zantedeschi]] publishes papers on the production of electric currents in closed circuits by the approach and withdrawal of a magnet, thereby anticipating Michael Faraday's classical experiments of 1831.
* 1831 &amp;mdash; [[Michael Faraday]] began experiments leading to his discovery of the law of [[electromagnetic induction]], though the discovery may have been anticipated by the work of Francesco Zantedeschi. His breakthrough came when he wrapped two insulated coils of wire around a massive iron ring, bolted to a chair, and found that upon passing a current through one coil, a momentary electric current was induced in the other coil. He then found that if he moved a magnet through a loop of wire, or vice versa, an electric current also flowed in the wire. He then used this principle to construct the [[Dynamo|electric dynamo]], the first electric power generator. He proposed that electromagnetic forces extended into the empty space around the conductor, but did not complete that work. Faraday's concept of lines of flux emanating from charged bodies and magnets provided a way to visualize electric and magnetic fields. That mental model was crucial to the successful development of electromechanical devices which were to dominate the 19th century. His demonstrations that a changing magnetic field produces an electric field,  mathematically modeled by [[Faraday's law of induction]], would subsequently become one of [[Maxwell's equations]]. These consequently evolved into the generalization of [[Field (physics)|field theory]].
* 1831 &amp;mdash; [[Macedonio Melloni]] uses a [[thermopile]] to detect infrared radiation
* 1832 &amp;mdash; [[Pavel Schilling|Baron Pavel L'vovitch Schilling]] (Paul Schilling) creates the first electromagnetic telegraph, consisting of a single-needle system in which a code was used to indicate the characters. Only months later, Göttingen professors [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]] constructed a telegraph that was working two years before Schilling could put his into practice. Schilling demonstrated the long-distance transmission of signals between two different rooms of his apartment and was the first to put into practice a binary system of signal transmission.
* 1833 &amp;mdash; [[Heinrich Lenz]] states [[Lenz's law]]: if an increasing (or decreasing) magnetic flux induces an [[Electromotive force|electromotive force (EMF)]], the resulting current will oppose a further increase (or decrease) in magnetic flux, i.e., that an induced current in a closed conducting loop will appear in such a direction that it opposes the change that produced it. Lenz's law is one consequence of the principle of [[conservation of energy]]. If a magnet moves towards a closed loop, then the induced current in the loop creates a field that exerts a force opposing the motion of the magnet. Lenz's law can be derived from [[Faraday's law of induction]] by noting the negative sign on the right side of the equation. He also independently discovered [[Joule's first law|Joule's law]] in '''1842'''; to honor his efforts, Russian physicists refer to it as the "Joule-Lenz law."
* 1833 &amp;mdash; [[Michael Faraday]] announces his law of [[Electrochemical_equivalent#Electrochemical_equivalents|electrochemical equivalents]]
* 1834 &amp;mdash; [[Heinrich Lenz]] determines the direction of the induced [[electromotive force]] (emf) and [[Electric current|current]] resulting from [[electromagnetic induction]]. [[Lenz's law]] provides a physical interpretation of the choice of sign in [[Faraday's law of induction]] (1831), indicating that the induced emf and the change in flux have opposite signs.
* 1834 &amp;mdash; [[Jean-Charles Peltier]] discovers the [[Peltier effect]]: heating by an electric current at the junction of two different metals.
* 1835 &amp;mdash; [[Joseph Henry]] invents the [[relay|electric relay]], which is an electrical switch by which the change of a weak current through the windings of an electromagnet will attract an armature to open or close the switch. Because this can control (by opening or closing) another, much higher-power, circuit, it is in a broad sense a form of electrical amplifier. This made a practical electric telegraph possible. He was the first to coil insulated wire tightly around an iron core in order to make an extremely powerful electromagnet, improving on William Sturgeon’s design, which used loosely coiled, uninsulated wire. He also discovered the property of [[self inductance]] independently of Michael Faraday.
[[File:International Morse Code.svg|right|thumb|180px|Chart of the [[Morse code]] letters and numerals.]]
* 1836 &amp;mdash; [[David Alter|Dr. David Alter]] invents and demonstrates to witnesses the first American electric telegraph in Elderton, Pennsylvania. In a later interview in the book, ''Biographical and Historical Cyclopedia of Indiana and Armstrong Counties'' he states: "I may say that there is no connection at all between the telegraph of Morse and others and that of myself...Professor Morse most probably never heard of me or my Elderton telegraph." In '''1840''' he invents an electric buggy, forerunner of the automobile. His inventions also include an electric clock and a short-range type of telephone, forerunner to Alexander Graham Bell's telephone. He is also credited with the origins of Spectrum Analysis by his idea that every element has its own emission spectrum, and an expansion of spectrum analysis to include the optical properties of gases.
* 1837 &amp;mdash; [[Samuel Morse]] develops an alternative electrical telegraph design capable of transmitting long distances over poor quality wire. He and his assistant [[Alfred Vail]] develop the [[Morse code]] signaling alphabet. In '''1838''' Morse successfully tested the device at the Speedwell Ironworks near [[Morristown, New Jersey]], and publicly demonstrated it to a scientific committee at the [[Franklin Institute]] in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania. The first electric telegram using this device was sent by Morse on 24 May, '''1844''' from Baltimore to Washington, D.C., bearing the message "[[Book of Numbers|What hath God wrought]]?"
* 1838 &amp;mdash; [[Michael Faraday]] uses Volta's battery to discover [[cathode ray]]s.
* 1839 &amp;mdash; [[Alexandre Edmond Becquerel]] observes the [[photoelectric effect]] with an electrode in a conductive solution exposed to light.
* 1840 &amp;mdash; [[James Prescott Joule]] formulates [[Joule's first law|Joule's Law]] (sometimes called the Joule-Lenz law) quantifying the amount of heat produced in a circuit as proportional to the product of the time duration, the resistance, and the square of the current passing through it.
* 1845 &amp;mdash; [[Michael Faraday]] discovers that light propagation in a material can be influenced by external [[magnetic field]]s ([[Faraday effect]])
* 1849 &amp;mdash; [[Hippolyte Fizeau]] and [[Jean-Bernard Foucault]] measure the speed of light to be about 298,000&amp;nbsp;km/s

* 1864 &amp;mdash; [[James Clerk Maxwell]] publishes his papers on a dynamical theory of the [[electromagnetic field]]
* 1865 &amp;mdash; [[James Clerk Maxwell]] publishes his landmark paper [[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]], in which [[Maxwell's equations]] demonstrated that electric and [[magnetism|magnetic]] forces are two complementary aspects of [[electromagnetism]]. He shows that the associated complementary electric and magnetic fields of electromagnetism travel through space, in the form of waves, at a constant velocity of 3.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; m/s. He also proposes that light is a form of electromagnetic radiation and that waves of oscillating electric and magnetic fields travel through empty space at a speed that could be predicted from simple electrical experiments. Using available data, he obtains a velocity of 310,740,000&amp;nbsp;m/s and states "This velocity is so nearly that of light, that it seems we have strong reason to conclude that light itself (including radiant heat, and other [[radiation]]s if any) is an electromagnetic disturbance in the form of waves propagated through the electromagnetic field according to electromagnetic laws."

While the earlier inventors had produced electric lighting in lab conditions, Edison concentrated on commercial application and was able to sell the concept to homes and businesses by mass-producing relatively long-lasting light bulbs and creating a complete system for the generation and distribution of electricity.
* 1879 &amp;mdash; [[Joseph Stefan|Jožef Stefan]] discovers the [[Stefan-Boltzmann law|Stefan-Boltzmann radiation law]] of a [[black body]] and uses it to calculate the first sensible value of the temperature of the Sun's surface to be 5700 [[Kelvin|K]]

* 1905 &amp;mdash; [[Albert Einstein]] proposes the [[Special Relativity|Theory of Special Relativity]], in which he rejects the existence of the [[Luminiferous aether|aether]] as unnecessary for explaining the propagation of electromagnetic waves. Instead, Einstein asserts ''as a [[postulate]]'' that the speed of light is constant in all [[inertial|inertial frames of reference]], and goes on to demonstrate a number of revolutionary (and highly counter-intuitive) consequences, including [[time dilation]], [[length contraction]], the [[relativity of simultaneity]], the [[relativistic mass|dependence of mass on velocity]], and the [[mass-energy equivalence|equivalence of mass and energy]].
* 1905 &amp;mdash; Einstein explains the [[photoelectric effect]] by extending Planck's idea of light quanta, or [[photons]], to the absorption and emission of [[photoelectrons]].  Einstein would later receive the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for this discovery, which launched the [[quantum mechanics|quantum revolution]] in physics.
* 1911 &amp;mdash; [[Superconductivity]] is discovered by [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]], who was studying the resistivity of solid mercury at cryogenic temperatures using the recently discovered liquid helium as a refrigerant.

'''Tuniu Corporation''' ({{zh|s=途牛旅游网}}) is a Chinese [[online travel agency]]. Products and services include packaged tours, accommodation reservation, airline and railway ticketing, car rentals, and corporate travel. The company listed on the [[NASDAQ|Nasdaq Stock Exchange]] on May 9, 2014. The company [[headquarters]] are located in [[Nanjing]] with offices in [[Shanghai]] and [[Beijing]].

== History ==
Founded in 2006 in Nanjing by current [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] Donald Dunde Yu and current [[Chief operating officer|COO]] Alex Haifeng Yan, the company was fully incorporated on June 1, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/companyProfile?symbol=TOUR.O|title=TUNIU Company Profile|last=|first=|date=|website=Reuters|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 9, 2014, Tuniu was listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange under TOUR, co-managed by [[Morgan Stanley|Morgan Stanley &amp; Co]], [[Credit Suisse|Credit Suisse Securities LLC]] and China Renaissance Securities. Tuniu raised $72 million in its [[initial public offering]], pricing 8 million shares at $9 per share. CEO Donald Dunde Yu rang the opening bell at the [[NASDAQ MarketSite|Nasdaq MarketSite]] in [[Times Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/2014-05/10/content_17497703.htm|title=Tuniu’s IPO on Nasdaq raises $72m{{!}}|last=|first=|date=|website=usa.chinadaily.com.cn|publisher=China Daily|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, Tuniu was the subject of a boycott by seventeen Chinese travel agencies over a pricing dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.techinasia.com/major-chinese-travel-agents-launch-boycott-tuniu|title=Major Chinese travel agents launch boycott of Tuniu|last=Custer|first=C.|date=Apr 23, 2015|website=www.techinasia.com|publisher=Tech in Asia|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was settled a few days later following an investigation by the [[China National Tourism Administration]], with partner relations returning to normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.cri.cn/12394/2015/04/25/4081s875979.htm|title=Tourism Authority to Investigate the Boycott of Tuniu.com|website=english.cri.cn|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinatravelnews.com/article/91540|title=Tuniu boycott ends as tour operators come back in the fold under CNTA oversight|last=|first=|date=Apr 27, 2016|website=www.chinatravelnews.com|publisher=ChinaTravelNews|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tuniu's share price fell 4.7% following news of the dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.barrons.com/asiastocks/2015/04/23/tuniu-tumbles-on-supplier-boycott-oversold-says-morgan-stanley/|title=Tuniu Tumbles On Supplier Boycott: Oversold, Says Morgan Stanley|last=Ren|first=Shuli|newspaper=Barrons|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 23, 2016, Tuniu’s Board of Directors authorized a [[Share repurchase|share repurchase program]] to repurchase up to $150 million worth of shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://asia.tools.euroland.com/tools/Pressreleases/GetPressRelease/?ID=3222643&amp;lang=en-GB&amp;companycode=cn-tour&amp;v=cn-tour_press|title=Tuniu Announces US$150 Million Share Repurchase Program|last=|first=|date=Aug 23, 2016|website=asia.tools.euroland.com|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tuniu’s share price had fallen below opening price.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-04/china-s-travel-site-tuniu-hurt-by-economic-woes-stronger-rivals|title=China's Travel Site Tuniu Hurt by Economic Woes, Stronger Rivals|date=2016-04-04|newspaper=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investments and acquisitions ==
On July 1, 2014, [[Ctrip]] CEO [[James Liang|James Jianzhang Liang]] was appointed to Tuniu’s Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://asia.tools.euroland.com/tools/Pressreleases/GetPressRelease/?ID=3210345&amp;lang=en-GB&amp;companycode=cn-tour&amp;v=cn-tour_press|title=Tuniu Appoints New Director|website=asia.tools.euroland.com|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On December 10, 2014, Tuniu and Ctrip signed a strategic collaboration agreement to share travel resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://asia.tools.euroland.com/tools/Pressreleases/GetPressRelease/?ID=3210320&amp;lang=en-GB&amp;companycode=cn-tour&amp;v=cn-tour_press|title=Tuniu and Ctrip Sign Strategic Collaboration Agreement|website=asia.tools.euroland.com|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 15, 2014, Tuniu announced $148 million investment in aggregate from a group that included the investment arms of [[Hony Capital]], [[JD.com]], Ctrip Investment Holding Ltd, and the personal holding companies of Tuniu’s CEO and COO. Ctrip acquired $15 million Tuniu shares during their IPO, and currently owns over 3% of Tuniu’s outstanding shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://asia.tools.euroland.com/tools/Pressreleases/GetPressRelease/?ID=3210319&amp;lang=en-GB&amp;companycode=cn-tour&amp;v=cn-tour_press|title=Tuniu Announces US$148 Million Investment in Aggregate from a Group of Investors|website=asia.tools.euroland.com|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May, 2015, Tuniu announced the investment of $500 million from a group of investors led by JD.com. JD.com became the largest shareholder in Tuniu with 27.5% stake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tnooz.com/article/tuniu.com-500m-dollars-investment-JD.com-ctrip/|title=China's Tuniu secures $500 million led by JD.com|newspaper=Tnooz|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 9, 2015, Tuniu announced the acquisition of majority stakes in two Chinese travel agencies, [[Hangzhou]]-based Zhejiang Zhongshan International Services and [[Tianjin]]-based China Classical Holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://asia.tools.euroland.com/tools/Pressreleases/GetPressRelease/?ID=3210313&amp;lang=en-GB&amp;companycode=cn-tour&amp;v=cn-tour_press|title=Tuniu Announces the Acquisitions of Two Travel Agencies|website=asia.tools.euroland.com|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 21, 2016, Tuniu announced the completion of a US$500 million investment from [[HNA Group|HNA Tourism Group]]. Transaction purchase price was US$5.50 per Class A ordinary share. HNA Tourism Group bought 24.1% share of Tuniu.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://asia.tools.euroland.com/tools/Pressreleases/GetPressRelease/?ID=3209095&amp;lang=en-GB&amp;companycode=cn-tour&amp;v=cn-tour_press|title=Tuniu Announces the Completion of US$500 Million Investment from HNA Tourism|website=asia.tools.euroland.com|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''U-Report''' is a free SMS social monitoring tool and real-time information system for community participation, designed to strengthen community-led development, citizen engagement, and positive change. SMS polls and alerts are sent out to U-reporters and real-time response information is collected. Results and ideas are shared back with the community. Issues polled include among others health, education, water, sanitation and hygiene, youth unemployment, HIV/ AIDS, disease outbreaks; social welfare sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undatarevolution.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/U-Report_1Pg_DataRev-1.pdf|title=U-Report Data Review|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative is currently operational in 41 countries and covers more than 3 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ukraine.ureport.in/|title=U-Report|website=ukraine.ureport.in|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Uganda]] became the first country in which [[UNICEF]] launched the U-Report mobile initiative in May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unicefstories.org/2014/05/20/ureport-connecting-young-people-to-government/|title=UReport connecting young people to government – Stories of UNICEF Innovation|website=unicefstories.org|language=en-US|accessdate=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country's population is one of the youngest in the world with over 55% of the population younger than 18 years and 78% - up to 30 years. Also there is a high level of using phones - 48%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unicefstories.org/2014/05/20/ureport-connecting-young-people-to-government/|title=UReport connecting young people to government – Stories of UNICEF Innovation|website=unicefstories.org|language=en-US|accessdate=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of U-Report in Uganda has prompted the launch of similar initiatives in [[Zambia]] in December 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.zambiaureport.com/media/downloads/PP_Zambia_UNICEF_U-Report_SMS_pilot_MR260813.pdf|title=Звіт UNICEF по Замбії|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Nigeria]] in June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cp-africa.com/2015/10/14/u-report-hits-1-million-responders-in-nigeria/|title=U-Report hits 1 million responders in Nigeria|date=2015-10-14|language=en-GB|work=CPAfrica|accessdate=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Zambia, U-report was used to accelerate [[Prevention of HIV/AIDS|HIV prevention]] among adolescents and young people. As a result of the U-Report, a significant increase in voluntary [[Diagnosis of HIV/AIDS|HIV testing]] was recorded - 40% compared to an average of 24% before.

In Nigeria, U-Report concentrates [[survey (human research)|survey]]s on social and medical issues. The number of reporters in Nigeria has increased dramatically in subsequent years and Nigeria has become the first country out of 1 million reporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cp-africa.com/2015/10/14/u-report-hits-1-million-responders-in-nigeria/|title=1 млн респондентів в Нігерії|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, 15 countries initiated a project with a total number of more than a million reporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.unicef.org/innovation/unicefs-u-report-reaches-1-million-registered-users-worldwide/|title=UNICEF’s U-Report Reaches 1 Million Registered Users Worldwide - Stories of Innovation|date=2015-07-10|language=en-US|work=Stories of Innovation|accessdate=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ukraine]] became the first in [[Europe]] and the world's 18th largest U-Report country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://12marathons.bit.ua/2017/06/u-report/|title=Простые технологии: как U-Report помогает молодым людям отстоять свое мнение – bit.ua|last=bit.ua|first=от|date=2017-06-19|language=ru-RU|work=bit.ua|accessdate=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presentation took place on April 23, 2016 in [[Kiev|Kyiv]] with the participation of 1,500 people and the well-known Ukrainian music band Pianoboy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://orest.com.ua/music/543-bekhem-i-pianoboy-prizvali-molodezh-ukrainy-k-proektu-u-report|title=Бэкхем и Pianoбой призвали молодежь Украины к проекту U-Report - OREST|language=ru|work=OREST|accessdate=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org.ua/ua/informatsiinyi-tsentr/news/3838-u-report|title=ЮНІСЕФ розпочинає в Україні нову молодіжну ініціативу – U-Report — Представництво ООН в Україні|website=www.un.org.ua|language=uk-ua|accessdate=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the year of activity in December 2016, there were over 25,000 u-reporters in Ukraine with 53% younger than 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dsmsu.gov.ua/index/en/material/28212|title=В Мінмолодьспорту відбулось засідання Наглядової ради проекту ЮНІСЕФ U-Report {{!}} SITE_NAME|website=www.dsmsu.gov.ua|accessdate=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for September 30 2018, there are 68,273 u-reporters in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ukraine.ureport.in/|title=Офіційний український сайт U-Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last country that joined the project was [[Malawi]], March 28, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unicefstories.org/2018/06/18/u-report-kicks-off-with-football-super-league-in-malawi/ https://www.mbc.mw/index.php/radio-2/item/6033-minister-advises-youth-to-use-social-media-positively|title=Малаві долучилася до проекту U-Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
UNICEF Innovation has been working with SMS systems since 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unicefstories.org/2014/09/22/small-messagesbig-changes-unicef-launches-rapidpro/|title=UNICEF запускає RAPIDPRO|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, when an open source platform called RapidSMS was developed. RapidPro is an open-source platform which allows the implementation of an SMS application without the need of a programmer. It provides real-time information and data analytics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://community.rapidpro.io/about-rapidpro/|title=About RapidPro|website=community.rapidpro.io|accessdate=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed by the UNICEF global Innovation Centre in collaboration with Nyuruka, a Rwandan software development firm. An additional advantage is the ability to create fields required for a specific context, in each country, different fields for the presentation of identical data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://community.rapidpro.io/about-rapidpro/|title=About RapidPro|website=community.rapidpro.io|accessdate=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two categories of information were identified based on data available from a sample of 6 countries ([[Mali]], [[Burundi]], [[Cameroon]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Central African Republic]]):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.unicef.org/innovation/discovering-the-endless-possibilities-with-u-report-big-data/|title=Discovering the endless possibilities with U-Report Big Data - Stories of Innovation|date=2015-06-29|language=en-US|work=Stories of Innovation|accessdate=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; identification (age, gender, occupation) and location ( different administrative levels) and a set of best practices for naming variables.

[[Telegram (service)|Telegram]] was chosen first in early 2016 because it was one of the first messaging applications to provide an open API that allowed organizations to develop and integrate chatbots with other platforms. Telegram, however, had low penetration in the countries where U-Report operates, so it was never used at scale. Later in 2016, U-Report tested the [[Facebook Messenger]] [[Application programming interface|API]] for delivering U-Report surveys. By late 2017, the integration was still at an early stage, but the U-Report team viewed its partnership with Facebook as a critical investment that would result in cost savings to U-Report and U-Reporters because, unlike SMS, there is no per-message cost to use Facebook Messenger. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://messengers.digitalimpactalliance.org/unicef.html|title=Internet Messaging Applications for Development|website=messengers.digitalimpactalliance.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=How To Use Chatbots For Humanitarian &amp; Social Impact Initiatives - TOPBOTS|url=https://www.topbots.com/chatbots-for-social-good/|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, U-Report [[Indonesia]] was launched on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unicefstories.org/2015/12/16/u-report-indonesia-officially-launched/|title=U-Report Indonesia Officially Launched – Stories of UNICEF Innovation|website=unicefstories.org|language=en-US|accessdate=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data received can be disaggregated by age, gender, States, LGAs, Wards and settlements in real time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undatarevolution.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/U-Report_1Pg_DataRev-1.pdf|title=Звіт U-Report за 2015 рік|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Results of activity ==
UNICEF examines the results of surveys and collaborates with organizations and government agencies to apply the results in practice: in programs, laws, decisions.

One example of U-Report in actionis in [[Liberia]] on sexual abuse in schools. To assess the magnitude of the situation, U-Report asked 13,000 users in Liberia whether teachers at their schools were exchanging grades for sex. An astonishing 86% of those polled said yes. Following U-Report’s discovery of a “Sex 4 Grades” epidemic, hotlines across the country were inundated by victims who now felt safe enough to reach out for support. Liberia’s Minister of Education and UNICEF are now collaborating on a plan to address the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/adelynzhou/2017/02/16/see-six-ways-bots-are-positively-changing-the-world/#4eeeef657c07|title=6 Ways Bots Are Positively Changing The World|last=Zhou|first=Adelyn|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

UNICEF [[Pakistan]] has since launched an MHM innovation challenge to encourage U-Reporters to come up with their own solutions to break the [[taboo]]. U-Reporters responded. 60 submitted valid proposals of which 7 were selected as [[wikt:grant|grant]] winners of up to PKR 250,000 to develop their ideas.  Winning ideas include a sanitary napkin vending machine, an artificial intelligence tool and an app that will be developed by young U-Reporters in partnership with [[Islamabad Engineering School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://community.rapidpro.io/stories/u-report-removes-taboos-talking-about-menstrual-hygiene/|title=U-Report removes taboos: talking about Menstrual Hygiene|website=community.rapidpro.io|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Well-known u-reporters ==
The project has two categories of users involved in the activities: u-reporters and u-[[Ambassador|ambassadors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unicefstories.org/2016/07/25/from-30-to-660-u-ambassadors-follow-u-report-pakavazs-journey/|title=From 30 to 660 U-Ambassadors, follow U-Report PakAvaz’s journey – Stories of UNICEF Innovation|website=unicefstories.org|language=en-US|accessdate=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; U-reporters - people who are interviewed and the U-ambassadors are the young people who distribute the idea of the project, organize the work with U-Reporters.

In September 2015, Beckham spoke with [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] and [[Anthony Lake]], executive director of UNICEF, in the building of the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly of the United Nations]] before the recently launched Youth Assembly, installed by [[Google]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsweek.com/soccer-star-david-beckham-highlights-childrens-rights-un-376173|title=David Beckham Talks Child Rights at the U.N.|date=2015-09-24|language=en|work=Newsweek|accessdate=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which displays messages from children from around the world.

Taras Topola, the front of the group ANTITALY, is the official representative of U-Report&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hromadske.ua/posts/volonterstvo-v-ukraini-taras-topolia|title=Публічне волонтерство в Україні: інтерв'ю з лідером гурту «Антитіла»|language=en|accessdate=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Ukraine. He constantly speaks at events, gives interviews. In 2017, Taras Topola made a tour with Ukraine in order to attract young people to U-report. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ukraine.ureport.in/story/516/|title=U-Report - ЮНІСЕФ Україна та Тарас Тополя підписали меморандум про співпрацю!|website=ukraine.ureport.in|accessdate=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove |date=April 2011}} 
A component of [[software configuration management]], '''version control''', also known as '''revision control''' or '''source control''',&lt;ref name=Mercurial&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Sullivan|first1=Bryan|title=Mercurial: the Definitive Guide|date=2009|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|location=Sebastopol|isbn=9780596555474|url=http://hgbook.red-bean.com/read/|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the management of changes to documents, [[computer program]]s, large web sites, and other collections of information. Changes are usually identified by a number or letter code, termed the "revision number", "revision level", or simply "revision". For example, an initial set of files is "revision 1". When the first change is made, the resulting set is "revision 2", and so on. Each revision is associated with a [[timestamp]] and the person making the change.  Revisions can be compared, restored, and with some types of files, merged.

The need for a logical way to organize and control revisions has existed for almost as long as [[writing]] has existed, but revision control became much more important, and complicated when the era of computing began.  The numbering of [[edition (book)|book edition]]s and of [[specification (technical standard)|specification revisions]] are examples that date back to the print-only era. Today, the most capable (as well as complex) revision control systems are those used in [[software development]], where a team of people may concurrently make changes to the same files.

'''Version control systems''' ('''VCS''') most commonly run as stand-alone applications, but revision control is also embedded in various types of software such as [[word processor]]s and [[spreadsheet]]s, collaborative [[groupware|web docs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://support.google.com/docs/answer/190843 |title=See what’s changed in a file |contribution=[[Google Docs]] |publisher=[[Google]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in various [[content management system]]s, e.g., Wikipedia's [[Help:Page history|page history]]. Revision control allows for the ability to revert a document to a previous revision, which is critical for allowing editors to track each other's edits, correct mistakes, and defend against vandalism and [[spamming]] in [[wiki]]s.

==Overview==
In computer [[software engineering]], revision control is any kind of practice that tracks and provides control over changes to [[source code]].  [[Software developer]]s sometimes use revision control software to maintain documentation and [[configuration file]]s as well as source code.

As teams design, develop and deploy software, it is common for multiple versions of the same software to be deployed in different sites and for the software's developers to be working simultaneously on updates.  [[Computer bug|Bugs]] or features of the software are often only present in certain versions (because of the fixing of some problems and the introduction of others as the program develops).  Therefore, for the purposes of locating and fixing bugs, it is vitally important to be able to retrieve and run different versions of the software to determine in which version(s) the problem occurs.  It may also be necessary to develop two versions of the software concurrently: for instance, where one version has bugs fixed, but no new features ([[Branching (revision control)|branch]]), while the other version is where new features are worked on ([[Trunk (software)|trunk]]).

At the simplest level, developers could simply retain multiple copies of the different versions of the program, and label them appropriately.  This simple approach has been used in many large software projects. While this method can work, it is inefficient as many near-identical copies of the program have to be maintained.  This requires a lot of self-discipline on the part of developers and often leads to mistakes.  Since the code base is the same, it also requires granting read-write-execute permission to a set of developers, and this adds the pressure of someone managing permissions so that the code base is not compromised, which adds more complexity. Consequently, systems to automate some or all of the revision control process have been developed. This ensures that the majority of management of version control steps is hidden behind the scenes.

Moreover, in software development, legal and business practice and other environments, it has become increasingly common for a single document or snippet of code to be edited by a team, the members of which may be geographically dispersed and may pursue different and even contrary interests.  Sophisticated revision control that tracks and accounts for ownership of changes to documents and code may be extremely helpful or even indispensable in such situations.

Revision control may also track changes to [[configuration files]], such as those typically stored in &lt;code&gt;/etc&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/etc&lt;/code&gt; on Unix systems. This gives system administrators another way to easily track changes made and a way to roll back to earlier versions should the need arise.

== History ==
{{empty section|date=December 2017}}

{{see also|Comparison of version control software#History and adoption}}

==Structure==
Revision control manages changes to a set of data over time. These changes can be structured in various ways.

Often the data is thought of as a collection of many individual items, such as files or documents, and changes to individual files are tracked. This accords with intuitions about separate files but causes problems when identity changes, such as during renaming, splitting or merging of files. Accordingly, some systems, such as [[git (software)|git]], instead consider changes to the data as a whole, which is less intuitive for simple changes but simplifies more complex changes.

When data that is under revision control is modified, after being retrieved by ''checking out,'' this is not in general immediately reflected in the revision control system (in the ''repository''), but must instead be ''checked in'' or ''committed.'' A copy outside revision control is known as a "working copy". As a simple example, when editing a computer file, the data stored in memory by the editing program is the working copy, which is committed by saving. Concretely, one may print out a document, edit it by hand, and only later manually input the changes into a computer and save it. For source code control, the working copy is instead a copy of all files in a particular revision, generally stored locally on the developer's computer;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In this case, edit buffers are a secondary form of working copy, and not referred to as such.&lt;/ref&gt; in this case saving the file only changes the working copy, and checking into the repository is a separate step.

If multiple people are working on a single data set or document, they are implicitly creating branches of the data (in their working copies), and thus issues of merging arise, as discussed below. For simple collaborative document editing, this can be prevented by using [[file locking]] or simply avoiding working on the same document that someone else is working on.

Revision control systems are often centralized, with a single authoritative data store, the ''repository,'' and check-outs and check-ins done with reference to this central repository. Alternatively, in [[distributed revision control]], no single repository is authoritative, and data can be checked out and checked into any repository. When checking into a different repository, this is interpreted as a merge or patch.

===Graph structure===
[[File:Revision controlled project visualization-2010-24-02.svg|thumb|upright|Example history graph of a revision-controlled project; trunk is in green, branches in yellow, and graph is not a tree due to presence of merges (the red arrows).]]
In terms of [[graph theory]], revisions are generally thought of as a line of development (the ''trunk'') with branches off of this, forming a directed tree, visualized as one or more parallel lines of development (the "mainlines" of the branches) branching off a trunk. In reality the structure is more complicated, forming a [[directed acyclic graph]], but for many purposes "tree with merges" is an adequate approximation.

Revisions occur in sequence over time, and thus can be arranged in order, either by revision number or timestamp.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In principle two revisions can have identical timestamp, and thus cannot be ordered on a line. This is generally the case for separate repositories, though is also possible for simultaneous changes to several branches in a single repository. In these cases, the revisions can be thought of as a set of separate lines, one per repository or branch (or branch within a repository).&lt;/ref&gt; Revisions are based on past revisions, though it is possible to largely or completely replace an earlier revision, such as "delete all existing text, insert new text". In the simplest case, with no branching or undoing, each revision is based on its immediate predecessor alone, and they form a simple line, with a single latest version, the "HEAD" revision or ''tip''. In [[graph theory]] terms, drawing each revision as a point and each "derived revision" relationship as an arrow (conventionally pointing from older to newer, in the same direction as time), this is a [[linear graph]]. If there is branching, so multiple future revisions are based on a past revision, or undoing, so a revision can depend on a revision older than its immediate predecessor, then the resulting graph is instead a [[directed tree]] (each node can have more than one child), and has multiple tips, corresponding to the revisions without children ("latest revision on each branch").&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The revision or repository "tree" should not be confused with the directory tree of files in a working copy.&lt;/ref&gt; In principle the resulting tree need not have a preferred tip ("main" latest revision) – just various different revisions – but in practice one tip is generally identified as HEAD. When a new revision is based on HEAD, it is either identified as the new HEAD, or considered a new branch.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Note that if a new branch is based on HEAD, then topologically HEAD is no longer a tip, since it has a child.&lt;/ref&gt; The list of revisions from the start to HEAD (in graph theory terms, the unique path in the tree, which forms a linear graph as before) is the ''trunk'' or ''mainline.''&lt;ref group="note"&gt;"Mainline" can also refer to the main path in a separate branch.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, when a revision can be based on more than one previous revision (when a node can have more than one ''parent''), the resulting process is called a ''[[merge (revision control)|merge]],'' and is one of the most complex aspects of revision control. This most often occurs when changes occur in multiple branches (most often two, but more are possible), which are then merged into a single branch incorporating both changes. If these changes overlap, it may be difficult or impossible to merge, and require manual intervention or rewriting.

In the presence of merges, the resulting graph is no longer a tree, as nodes can have multiple parents, but is instead a rooted [[directed acyclic graph]] (DAG). The graph is acyclic since parents are always backwards in time, and rooted because there is an oldest version. However, assuming that there is a trunk, merges from branches can be considered as "external" to the tree – the changes in the branch are packaged up as a ''patch,'' which is applied to HEAD (of the trunk), creating a new revision without any explicit reference to the branch, and preserving the tree structure. Thus, while the actual relations between versions form a DAG, this can be considered a tree plus merges, and the trunk itself is a line.

In distributed revision control, in the presence of multiple repositories these may be based on a single original version (a root of the tree), but there need not be an original root, and thus only a separate root (oldest revision) for each repository, for example, if two people starting working on a project separately. Similarly in the presence of multiple data sets (multiple projects) that exchange data or merge, there isn’t a single root, though for simplicity one may think of one project as primary and the other as secondary, merged into the first with or without its own revision history.

==Specialized strategies==
Engineering revision control developed from formalized processes based on tracking revisions of early blueprints or [[whiteprint|bluelines]]{{Citation needed|reason=The rest of this paragraph is fairly specific; it sounds almost like it should've been part of an elder engineering book, any sources?|date=December 2017}}. This system of control implicitly allowed returning to an earlier state of the design, for cases in which an engineering dead-end was reached in the development of the design. A revision table was used to keep track of the changes made. Additionally, the modified areas of the drawing were highlighted using revision clouds.

Version control is widespread in business and law. Indeed, "contract redline" and "legal blackline" are some of the earliest forms of revision control,&lt;ref&gt;For Engineering drawings, see [[Whiteprint#Document control]], for some of the manual systems in place in the twentieth century, for example, the ''Engineering Procedures'' of [[Hughes Aircraft]], each revision of which required approval by [[Lawrence A. Hyland]]; see also the approval procedures instituted by the U.S. government.&lt;/ref&gt; and are still employed in business and law with varying degrees of sophistication.  The most sophisticated techniques are beginning to be used for the electronic tracking of changes to [[CAD file]]s (see [[product data management]]), supplanting the "manual" electronic implementation of traditional revision control.{{fact|date=November 2016}}

==Source-management models==
Traditional revision control systems use a centralized model where all the revision control functions take place on a shared [[Server (computing)|server]]. If two developers try to change the same file at the same time, without some method of managing access the developers may end up overwriting each other's work. Centralized revision control systems solve this problem in one of two different "source management models": file locking and version merging.

===Atomic operations===
{{Main|Atomic commit}}
An operation is ''atomic'' if the system is left in a consistent state even if the operation is interrupted. The ''commit'' operation is usually the most critical in this sense. Commits tell the revision control system to make a group of changes final, and available to all users. Not all revision control systems have atomic commits; notably, [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] lacks this feature.

===File locking===
The simplest method of preventing "[[concurrent access]]" problems involves [[file locking|locking files]] so that only one developer at a time has write access to the central "repository" copies of those files. Once one developer "checks out" a file, others can read that file, but no one else may change that file until that developer "checks in" the updated version (or cancels the checkout).

File locking has both merits and drawbacks.  It can provide some protection against difficult merge conflicts when a user is making radical changes to many sections of a large file (or group of files).  However, if the files are left exclusively locked for too long, other developers may be tempted to bypass the revision control software and change the files locally, leading to more serious problems.

===Version merging===
{{Main|Merge (revision control)}}
Most version control systems allow multiple developers to edit the same file at the same time. The first developer to "check in" changes to the central repository always succeeds. The system may provide facilities to [[Merge (revision control)|merge]] further changes into the central repository, and preserve the changes from the first developer when other developers check in.

Merging two files can be a very delicate operation, and usually possible only if the data structure is simple, as in [[text file]]s. The result of a merge of two [[image file]]s might not result in an image file at all. The second developer checking in the code will need to take care with the merge, to make sure that the changes are compatible and that the merge operation does not introduce its own [[logic]] errors within the files. These problems limit the availability of automatic or semi-automatic merge operations mainly to simple text-based documents, unless a specific merge [[Plug-in (computing)|plugin]] is available for the file types.

The concept of a ''reserved edit'' can provide an optional means to explicitly lock a file for exclusive write access, even when a merging capability exists.

===Baselines, labels and tags===
Most revision control tools will use only one of these similar terms (baseline, label, tag) to refer to the action of identifying a snapshot ("label the project") or the record of the snapshot ("try it with baseline ''X''").  Typically only one of the terms ''baseline'', ''label'', or ''tag'' is used in documentation or discussion{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}; they can be considered synonyms.

In most projects, some snapshots are more significant than others, such as those used to indicate published releases, branches, or milestones.

When both the term ''baseline'' and either of ''label'' or ''tag'' are used together in the same context, ''label'' and ''tag'' usually refer to the mechanism within the tool of identifying or making the record of the snapshot, and ''baseline'' indicates the increased significance of any given label or tag.

Most formal discussion of [[configuration management]] uses the term [[Baseline (configuration management)|''baseline'']].

==Distributed revision control==
{{Main|Distributed version control}}
Distributed revision control systems (DRCS) take a peer-to-peer approach, as opposed to the [[client-server model|client-server]] approach of centralized systems. Rather than a single, central repository on which clients synchronize, each peer's working copy of the codebase is a [[good faith|bona-fide]] repository.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | last = Wheeler
  | first = David
  | title = Comments on Open Source Software / Free Software (OSS/FS) Software Configuration Management (SCM) Systems
  | url = http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/scm.html
  | accessdate = May 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Distributed revision control conducts synchronization by exchanging [[Patch (Unix)|patches]] (change-sets) from peer to peer. This results in some important differences from a centralized system:
* No canonical, reference copy of the codebase exists by default; only working copies.
* Common operations (such as commits, viewing history, and reverting changes) are fast, because there is no need to communicate with a central server.&lt;ref name=Mercurial/&gt;{{rp|7}}
Rather, communication is only necessary when pushing or pulling changes to or from other peers.
* Each working copy effectively functions as a remote backup of the codebase and of its change-history, providing inherent protection against data loss.&lt;ref name=Mercurial/&gt;{{rp|4}}

==Integration==
Some of the more advanced revision-control tools offer many other facilities, allowing deeper integration with other tools and software-engineering processes. [[Plug-in (computing)|Plugins]] are often available for [[integrated development environment|IDEs]] such as [[Oracle JDeveloper]], [[IntelliJ IDEA]], [[Eclipse (computing)|Eclipse]] and [[Visual Studio]]. [[Delphi (programming language)|Delphi]], [[NetBeans|NetBeans IDE]], [[Xcode]] and [[GNU Emacs]] (via vc.el) come with integrated version control support.

==Common terminology==
Terminology can vary from system to system, but some terms in common usage include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wingerd | first = Laura | title = Practical Perforce | publisher = O'Reilly | year = 2005 | url = http://safari.oreilly.com/0596101856 | isbn =  0-596-10185-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; [[baseline (configuration management)|Baseline]] : An approved revision of a document or source file from which subsequent changes can be made.  See [[#Baselines, labels and tags|baselines, labels and tags]].
; [[branching (revision control)|Branch]] : A set of files under version control may be ''branched'' or ''forked'' at a point in time so that, from that time forward, two copies of those files may develop at different speeds or in different ways independently of each other.
; Change : A ''change'' (or ''[[diff]]'', or ''[[Delta encoding|delta]]'') represents a specific modification to a document under version control.  The granularity of the modification considered a change varies between version control systems.
; Change list : On many version control systems with [[atomic transaction|atomic]] multi-change commits, a ''change list'' (or ''CL''), ''change set'', ''update'', or ''patch'' identifies the set of ''changes'' made in a single commit.  This can also represent a sequential view of the source code, allowing the examination of source "as of" any particular changelist ID.
; Checkout : To ''check out'' (or ''co'') is to create a local working copy from the repository. A user may specify a specific revision or obtain the latest. The term 'checkout' can also be used as a noun to describe the working copy.
; Clone : ''Cloning'' means creating a repository containing the revisions from another repository. This is equivalent to ''push''ing or ''pull''ing into an empty (newly initialized) repository. As a noun, two repositories can be said to be ''clone''s if they are kept synchronized, and contain the same revisions.
; [[Commit (revision control)|Commit]] : To ''commit'' (''check in'', ''ci'' or, more rarely, ''install'', ''submit'' or ''record'') is to write or merge the changes made in the working copy back to the repository. The terms 'commit' and 'checkin' can also be used as nouns to describe the new revision that is created as a result of committing.
; Conflict : A conflict occurs when different parties make changes to the same document, and the system is unable to reconcile the changes.  A user must ''resolve'' the conflict by combining the changes, or by selecting one change in favour of the other.
; Delta compression : Most revision control software uses [[delta compression]], which retains only the differences between successive versions of files.  This allows for more efficient storage of many different versions of files.
; Dynamic stream : A stream in which some or all file versions are mirrors of the parent stream's versions.
; Export : ''exporting'' is the act of obtaining the files from the repository. It is similar to ''checking out'' except that it creates a clean directory tree without the version-control metadata used in a working copy. This is often used prior to publishing the contents, for example.
; Fetch : See ''pull''.
; Forward integration : The process of merging changes made in the main ''trunk'' into a development (feature or team) branch.
; Head: Also sometimes called ''tip'', this refers to the most recent commit, either to the trunk or to a branch. The trunk and each branch have their own head, though HEAD is sometimes loosely used to refer to the trunk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://garygregory.wordpress.com/2011/02/03/trunk-vs-head-in-version-control-systems/ |title=Trunk vs. HEAD in Version Control Systems |date= February 3, 2011 | first =Gary | last = Gregory | work= Java, Eclipse, and other tech tidbits |accessdate= 2012-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Import : ''importing'' is the act of copying a local directory tree (that is not currently a working copy) into the repository for the first time.
; Initialize : to create a new, empty repository.
; Interleaved deltas : some revision control software uses [[Interleaved deltas]], a method that allows storing the history of text based files in a more efficient way than by using [[Delta compression]]. 
; Label : See ''tag''.
; Mainline : Similar to ''trunk'', but there can be a mainline for each branch.
; [[Merge (revision control)|Merge]] : A ''merge'' or ''integration'' is an operation in which two sets of changes are applied to a file or set of files. Some sample scenarios are as follows:
:* A user, working on a set of files, ''updates'' or ''syncs'' their working copy with changes made, and checked into the repository, by other users.{{Sfn | Collins-Sussman | Fitzpatrick | Pilato | 2004 | loc = [http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.tour.cycle.html#svn.tour.cycle.resolve  1.5: SVN tour cycle resolve] | ps =: ‘The G stands for merGed, which means that the file had local changes to begin with, but the changes coming from the repository didn't overlap with the local changes.’}}
:* A user tries to ''check in'' files that have been updated by others since the files were ''checked out'', and the ''revision control software'' automatically merges the files (typically, after prompting the user if it should proceed with the automatic merge, and in some cases only doing so if the merge can be clearly and reasonably resolved).
:* A ''branch'' is created, the code in the files is independently edited, and the updated branch is later incorporated into a single, unified ''trunk''.
:* A set of files is ''branched'', a problem that existed before the branching is fixed in one branch, and the fix is then merged into the other branch. (This type of selective merge is sometimes known as a ''cherry pick'' to distinguish it from the complete merge in the previous case.)
; Promote : The act of copying file content from a less controlled location into a more controlled location. For example, from a user's workspace into a repository, or from a stream to its parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Concepts Manual | edition = Version 4.7 | publisher = Accurev | date = July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Pull, push: Copy revisions from one repository into another. ''Pull'' is initiated by the receiving repository, while ''push'' is initiated by the source. ''Fetch'' is sometimes used as a synonym for ''pull'', or to mean a ''pull'' followed by an ''update''.
; [[Repository (version control)|Repository]] : The ''repository'' is where files' current and historical data are stored, often on a server. Sometimes also called a ''depot''.
; Resolve : The act of user intervention to address a conflict between different changes to the same document.
; Reverse integration : The process of merging different team branches into the main trunk of the versioning system.
; Revision : Also ''version'': A [[Software versioning|version]] is any change in form.  In [[SVK]], a Revision is the state at a point in time of the entire tree in the repository.
; Share: The act of making one file or folder available in multiple branches at the same time. When a shared file is changed in one branch, it is changed in other branches.
; Stream : A container for branched files that has a known relationship to other such containers. Streams form a hierarchy; each stream can inherit various properties (like versions, namespace, workflow rules, subscribers, etc.) from its parent stream.
; [[Revision tag|Tag]] : A ''tag'' or ''label'' refers to an important snapshot in time, consistent across many files.  These files at that point may all be tagged with a user-friendly, meaningful name or revision number.  See [[#Baselines, labels and tags|baselines, labels and tags]].
; [[Trunk (software)|Trunk]]: The unique line of development that is not a branch (sometimes also called Baseline, Mainline or Master)
; Update : An ''update'' (or ''sync'', but ''sync'' can also mean a combined ''push'' and ''pull'') merges changes made in the repository (by other people, for example) into the local ''working copy''.  ''Update'' is also the term used by some CM tools (CM+, PLS, SMS) for the change package concept (see ''changelist''). Synonymous with ''checkout'' in revision control systems that require each repository to have exactly one working copy (common in distributed systems)
; Working copy: The ''working copy'' is the local copy of files from a repository, at a specific time or revision. All work done to the files in a repository is initially done on a working copy, hence the name. Conceptually, it is a ''[[Sandbox (software development)|sandbox]]''.
