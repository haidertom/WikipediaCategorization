By Mary Wollstonecraft. The Second Edition. London: Printed for J. Johnson, No. 72, St. Paul's Church-Yard. M.DCC.XC."|Title page from the second edition of ''A Vindication of the Rights of Men'', the first to carry [[Mary Wollstonecraft|Wollstonecraft's]] name]]

{{Use British English|date=May 2013}}
'''''A Vindication of the Rights of Men, in a Letter to the Right Honourable Edmund Burke; Occasioned by His Reflections on the Revolution in France''''' (1790) is a political [[pamphlet]], written by the 18th-century British liberal feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|title=Mary Wollstonecraft – Equal Rights for Women|journal=Foundation for Economic Education|url=https://fee.org/articles/mary-wollstonecraft-equal-rights-for-women/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which attacks [[aristocracy]] and advocates [[republicanism]]. Wollstonecraft's was the first response in a [[Revolution Controversy|pamphlet war]] sparked by the publication of [[Edmund Burke|Edmund Burke's]] ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790), a defense of [[Constitutional monarchy#Constitutional monarchy in the United Kingdom|constitutional monarchy]], aristocracy, and the [[Church of England]].

Wollstonecraft attacked not only hereditary privilege, but also the rhetoric that Burke used to defend it. Most of Burke's detractors deplored what they viewed as his theatrical pity for [[Marie Antoinette]], but Wollstonecraft was unique in her love of Burke's gendered language. By saying the ''[[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]'' and the ''beautiful'', terms first established by Burke himself in ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]]'' (1756), she kept his rhetoric as well as his argument. In her first unabashedly feminist critique, which Wollstonecraft scholar [[Claudia L. Johnson (scholar)|Claudia Johnson]] describes as unsurpassed in its argumentative force,&lt;ref name="multiref1"&gt;Johnson, 27; see also, Todd, 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft indicts Burke's justification of an equal society founded on the passivity of women.

In her arguments for republican virtue, Wollstonecraft invokes an emerging middle-class ethos in opposition to what she views as the vice-ridden aristocratic code of manners. Driven by an [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] belief in progress, she derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom. She describes an idyllic country life in which each family has a farm sufficient for its needs. Wollstonecraft contrasts her [[utopia]]n picture of society, drawn with what she claims is genuine feeling, with Burke's false theatrical ''tableaux''.

The ''Rights of Men'' was successful: it was reviewed by every major periodical of the day and the first edition, published anonymously, sold out in three weeks. However, upon the publication of the second edition (the first to carry Wollstonecraft's name on the title page), the reviews began to evaluate the text not only as a political pamphlet but also as the work of a female writer. They contrasted Wollstonecraft's "passion" with Burke's "reason" and spoke condescendingly of the text and its female author. This remained the prevailing analysis of the ''Rights of Men'' until the 1970s, when [[feminist literary criticism|feminist scholars]] revisited Wollstonecraft's texts and endeavoured to bring greater attention to their intellectualism.

==Historical context==

===Revolution Controversy===
{{main|Revolution Controversy}}
[[File:Le Serment du Jeu de paume.jpg|right|thumb|300px|alt=The focus of the chalk drawing is at the center, where one man is standing on a table. Below him, three men are grouped together, joining hands. Around them are dozes of men, with their hands upraised. People look in from the windows.|''Tennis Court Oath'' (1791) by [[Jacques-Louis David]]]]

''A Vindication of the Rights of Men'' was written against the backdrop of the [[French Revolution]] and the debates that it provoked in Britain. In a lively and sometimes vicious pamphlet war, now referred to as the ''[[Revolution Controversy]]'', which lasted from 1789 until the end of 1795, British political commentators argued over the validity of monarchy. One scholar has called this debate "perhaps the last real discussion of the fundamentals of politics in [Britain]".&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Butler, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The power of popular agitation in revolutionary France, demonstrated in events such as the [[Tennis Court Oath]] and the [[storming of the Bastille]] in 1789, reinvigorated the [[Radicalism (historical)#United Kingdom|British reform movement]], which had been largely moribund for a decade. Efforts to reform the British electoral system and to distribute the seats in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] more equitably were revived.&lt;ref&gt;Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xi–xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the vigorous political debate in the 1790s was sparked by the publication of [[Edmund Burke|Edmund Burke's]] ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' in November 1790. Most commentators in Britain expected Burke to support the French revolutionaries, because he had previously been part of the liberal [[British Whig Party|Whig]] party, a critic of monarchical power, a supporter of the [[American revolution]]aries, and a prosecutor of government malfeasance in India. When he failed to do so, it shocked the populace and angered his friends and supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, 33; Kelly, 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke's book, despite being priced at an expensive three [[shilling]]s, sold an astonishing 30,000 copies in two years.&lt;ref name="Butler345"&gt;Butler, 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Paine|Thomas Paine's]] famous response, ''[[The Rights of Man]]'' (1792), which became the rallying cry for thousands, however, greatly surpassed it, selling upwards of 200,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wollstonecraft's ''Rights of Men'' was published only weeks after Burke's ''Reflections''. While Burke supported aristocracy, monarchy, and the Established Church, liberals such as [[William Godwin]], Paine, and Wollstonecraft, argued for [[republicanism]], agrarian socialism, [[anarchy]], and religious toleration.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of those who came to be called radicals supported similar aims: individual liberties and [[civic virtue]]. They were also united in the same broad criticisms: opposition to the bellicose "landed interest" and its role in government corruption, and opposition to a monarchy and aristocracy who they believed were unlawfully seizing the people's power.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

1792 was the "''annus mirabilis'' of eighteenth-century radicalism": its most important texts were published and the influence of radical associations, such as the [[London Corresponding Society]] (LCS) and the [[Society for Constitutional Information]] (SCI), was at its height.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, "Introductory essay", 7; see also Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xii.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until these middle- and working-class groups formed an alliance with the genteel [[Friends of the People Society|Society of the Friends of the People]] that the government became concerned. After this alliance was formed, the conservative-dominated government prohibited [[seditious]] writings. Over 100 prosecutions for sedition took place in the 1790s alone, a dramatic increase from previous decades.&lt;ref&gt;Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; The British government, fearing an uprising similar to the French Revolution, took even more drastic steps to quash the radicals: they made ever more political arrests and infiltrated radical groups; they threatened to "revoke the licences of publicans who continued to host politicised debating societies and to carry reformist literature"; they seized the mail of "suspected dissidents"; they supported groups that disrupted radical events; and they attacked dissidents in the press.&lt;ref&gt;Keen, 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Radicals saw this period, which included the [[1794 Treason Trials]], as "the institution of a system of TERROR, almost as hideous in its features, almost as gigantic in its stature, and infinitely more pernicious in its tendency, than France ever knew."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

When, in October 1795, crowds threw refuse at [[George III]] and insulted him, demanding a cessation of the [[French revolutionary wars|war with France]] and lower bread prices, Parliament immediately passed the "gagging acts" (the [[Seditious Meetings Act 1795|Seditious Meetings Act]] and the [[Treasonable Practices Act]], also known as the "Two Acts"). Under these new laws, it was almost impossible to hold public meetings and speech was severely curtailed at those that were held.&lt;ref&gt;Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xxxv; Keen, 54.&lt;/ref&gt; British radicalism was effectively muted during the later 1790s and 1800s. It was not until the next generation that any [[Reform Act 1832|real reform]] could be enacted.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, "Introductory essay", 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burke's ''Reflections''===
{{main|Reflections on the Revolution in France}}

Published partially in response to [[English dissenters|Dissenting]] clergyman [[Richard Price|Richard Price's]] sermon celebrating the French revolution, Burke used the device of a mock-letter to a young Frenchman's plea for guidance in order to defend aristocratic government, paternalism, loyalty, chivalry, and [[primogeniture]].&lt;ref name="Butler345"/&gt; He viewed the French Revolution as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government. In ''Reflections'', he argues that citizens do not have the right to revolt against their government, because civilizations, including governments, are the result of social and political consensus. If a culture's traditions were continually challenged, he contends, the result would be anarchy.
[[File:BurkeReflections.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Page reads "Reflections on the Revolution in France, and on the Proceedings in Certain Societies in London Relative to that Event. In a Letter Intended to have been sent to a Gentleman in Paris. By the Right Honourable Edmund Burke. London: Printed for J. Dodsley, in Pall-Mall. M.DCC.XC."|Title page from [[Edmund Burke|Burke's]] ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790)]]
Burke criticizes many British thinkers and writers who welcomed the early stages of the French Revolution. While the radicals likened the revolution to Britain's own [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688, which had restricted the powers of the monarchy, Burke argues that the appropriate historical analogy was the [[English Civil War]] (1642–1651), in which [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] had been executed in 1649.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, 1–2; 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time Burke was writing, however, there had been very little revolutionary violence; more concerned with persuading his readers than informing them, he greatly exaggerated this element of the revolution in his text for rhetorical effect. In his ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful|Enquiry into the Sublime and Beautiful]]'', he had argued that "large inexact notions convey ideas best", and to generate fear in the reader, in ''Reflections'' he constructs the set-piece of [[Louis XVI]] and [[Marie Antoinette]] forced from their palace at sword point. When the violence actually escalated in France in 1793 with the [[Reign of Terror]], Burke was viewed as a prophet.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke also criticizes the learning associated with the French ''[[philosophes]]''; he maintains that new ideas should not, in an imitation of the emerging discipline of science, be tested on society in an effort to improve it, but that populations should rely on custom and tradition to guide them.&lt;ref name="Butler345"/&gt;

===Composition and publication of the ''Rights of Men''===
In the advertisement printed at the beginning of the ''Rights of Men'', Wollstonecraft describes how and why she wrote it:
{{quote|text=
MR. BURKE'S Reflections on the French Revolution first engaged my attention as the transient topic of the day; and reading it more for amusement than information, my indignation was roused by the sophistical arguments, that every moment crossed me, in the questionable shape of natural feelings and common sense.

Many pages of the following letter were the effusions of the moment; but, swelling imperceptibly to a considerable size, the idea was suggested of publishing a short vindication of ''the Rights of Men.''

Not having leisure or patience to follow this desultory writer through all the devious tracks in which his fancy has started fresh game, I have confined my strictures, in a great measure, to the grand principles at which he has levelled many ingenious arguments in a very specious garb.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 33.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
So the pamphlet could be published as soon as she finished writing it, Wollstonecraft wrote frantically while her publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]] printed the pages. In fact, Godwin's ''[[Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman|Memoirs]]'' of Wollstonecraft tells that the sheets of manuscript were delivered to the press as they were written.&lt;ref&gt;Godwin, ch. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Halfway through the work, however, she ceased writing. One biographer describes it as a "loss of nerve"; Godwin, in his ''Memoirs'', describes it as "a temporary fit of torpor and indolence".&lt;ref&gt;Godwin, 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson, perhaps canny enough at this point in their friendship to know how to encourage her, agreed to dispose of the book and told her not to worry about it. Ashamed, she rushed to finish.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 164; see also Johnson, 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wollstonecraft's ''Rights of Men'' was published anonymously on 29 November 1790, the first of between fifty and seventy responses to Burke by various authors.&lt;ref&gt;Furniss, 60; Taylor, 7; Sapiro, 23; Myers, 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Only three weeks later, on 18 December, a second edition, with her name printed on the title page, was issued.&lt;ref&gt;Furniss, 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft took time to edit the second edition, which, according to biographer Emily Sunstein, "sharpened her personal attack on Burke" and changed much of the text from [[First-person narrative|first person]] to [[third-person narrative|third person]]; "she also added a non-partisan code criticising hypocritical liberals who talk equality but scrape before the powers that be."&lt;ref&gt;Sunstein, 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and major arguments==
[[File:EdmundBurke1771.jpg|right|thumb|Near-profile, half-length portrait of a man wearing a brown suit who has reddish-brown hair and a ruddy complexion.|[[Edmund Burke]], painted by the studio of [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]] (1771)]]

Until the 1970s, the ''Rights of Men'' was typically considered disorganized, incoherent, illogical, and replete with ''[[ad hominem]]'' attacks (such as the suggestion that Burke would have promoted the crucifixion of Christ if he were a Jew).&lt;ref name="W434"&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; It had been touted as an example of "feminine" emotion tilting at "masculine" reason.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 26; Myers, 114.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the 1970s scholars have challenged this view, arguing that Wollstonecraft employed 18th-century modes of writing, such as the digression, to great rhetorical effect. More importantly, as scholar Mitzi Myers argues, "Wollstonecraft is virtually alone among those who answered Burke in eschewing a narrowly political approach for a wide-ranging critique of the foundation of the ''Reflections''."&lt;ref&gt;Myers, 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft makes a primarily moral argument; her "polemic is not a confutation of Burke's political theories, but an exposure of the cruel inequities which those theories presuppose."&lt;ref&gt;Myers, 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft's style was also a deliberate choice, enabling her to respond to Burke's ''Enquiry into the Sublime and Beautiful'' as well as to ''Reflections''.&lt;ref name="Johnson26"&gt;Johnson, 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The style of the ''Rights of Men'' mirrors much of Burke's own text. It has no clear structure; like ''Reflections'', the text follows the mental associations made by the author as she was writing.&lt;ref&gt;Poovey, 58; Kelly, 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft's political treatise is written, like Burke's, in the form of a letter: his to C. J. F. DePont, a young Frenchman, and hers to Burke himself.&lt;ref name="Sapiro197"&gt;Sapiro, 197.&lt;/ref&gt; Using the same form, metaphors, and style as Burke, she turns his own argument back on him. The ''Rights of Men'' is as much about language and argumentation as it is about political theory; in fact, Wollstonecraft claims that these are inseparable.&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 197; Myers, 121; Kelly, 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt; She advocates, as one scholar writes, "simplicity and honesty of expression, and argument employing reason rather than eloquence."&lt;ref name="Sapiro197"/&gt; At the beginning of the pamphlet, she appeals to Burke: "Quitting now the flowers of rhetoric, let us, Sir, reason together."&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Rights of Men'' does not aim to present a fully articulated alternative political theory to Burke's, but instead to demonstrate the weaknesses and contradictions in his own argument. Therefore, much of the text is focused on Burke's logical inconsistencies, such as his support of the American revolution and the [[George IV of the United Kingdom#Regency crisis of 1788|Regency Bill]] (which proposed restricting monarchical power during George III's madness in 1788), in contrast to his lack of support for the French revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 26; see also, Poovey 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt; In criticism of Burke's contradictory support of the Regency Bill along with supporting the rule of monarchy in France, she writes:
{{quote|text=
You were so eager to taste the sweets of power, that you could not wait till time had determined, whether a dreadful delirium would settle into a confirmed madness; but, prying into the secrets of Omnipotence, you thundered out that God had ''hurled him from his throne'', and that it was the most insulting mockery to recollect that he had been a king, or treat him with any particular respect on account of his former dignity…. I have, Sir, been reading, with a scrutinizing, comparative eye, several of your insensible and profane speeches during the King's illness. I disdain to take advantage of a man's weak side, or draw consequences from an unguarded transport—A lion preys not on carcasses!&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 59.&lt;/ref&gt; [emphasis Wollstonecraft's]
}}
Wollstonecraft's goal, she writes, is "to shew you [Burke] to yourself, stripped of the gorgeous drapery in which you have enwrapped your tyrannic principles."&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 70; see also Myers, 120–21.&lt;/ref&gt; However, she does also gesture towards a larger argument of her own, focusing on the inequalities faced by British citizens because of the class system.&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 82; Todd, 218; Kelly, 88.&lt;/ref&gt; As Wollstonecraft scholar Barbara Taylor writes, "treating Burke as a representative spokesman for old-regime despotism, Wollstonecraft champions the reformist initiatives of the new French government against his 'rusty, baneful opinions', and censures British political elites for their opulence, corruption, and inhumane treatment of the poor."&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political theory==

===Attack against rank and privilege===
Wollstonecraft's attack on rank and hierarchy dominates the ''Rights of Men''. She chastises Burke for his contempt for the people, whom he dismisses as the "swinish multitude", and berates him for supporting the elite, most notably [[Marie Antoinette]].&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 199; Jones, 49; Johnson, 28; Myers, 123–24.&lt;/ref&gt; In a famous passage, Burke had written: "I had thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from their scabbards to avenge even a look that threatened her with insult.—But the age of chivalry is gone."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Butler, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft's ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792) and ''An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution'' (1794) extend the specific arguments made in the ''Rights of Men'' into larger social and political contexts.&lt;!--this sentence seems a bit out of place here--&gt;

Contrasting her middle-class values against Burke's aristocratic ones, Wollstonecraft contends that people should be judged on their merits rather than on their birthrights.&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 83; Kelly, 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt; As Wollstonecraft scholar [[Janet Todd]] writes, "the vision of society revealed [in] ''A Vindication of the Rights of Men'' was one of talents, where entrepreneurial, unprivileged children could compete on equal terms with the now wrongly privileged."&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft emphasizes the benefits of hard work, self-discipline, frugality, and morality, values she contrasts with the "vices of the rich", such as "insincerity" and the "want of natural affections".&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 95; see also Jones, 49; 51; Poovey, 65; Myers, 125.&lt;/ref&gt; She endorses a [[commercialism|commercial]] society that would help individuals discover their own potential as well as force them to realize their civic responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 51.&lt;/ref&gt; For her, commercialism would be the great equalizing force.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 53.&lt;/ref&gt; However, several years later, in ''[[Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark]]'' (1796), she would question the ultimate benefits of commercialism to society.

While [[English dissenters|Dissenting]] clergyman [[Richard Price]], whose sermon helped spark Burke's work, is the villain of ''Reflections'', he is the hero of the ''Rights of Men''. Both Wollstonecraft and Burke associate him with [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinking, particularly the notion that civilization could progress through rational debate, but they interpret that stance differently. Burke believed such relentless questioning would lead to anarchy, while Wollstonecraft connected Price with "reason, liberty, free discussion, mental superiority, the improving exercise of the mind, moral excellence, active benevolence, orientation toward the present and future, and the rejection of power and riches"—quintessential middle-class professional values.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, 118; Kelly, 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wollstonecraft wields the English philosopher [[John Locke|John Locke's]] definition of property (that is, ownership acquired through labour) against Burke's notion of inherited wealth. She contends that inheritance is one of the major impediments to the progress of European civilization,&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro 84; see also, Jones, 49–50; Sapiro, xx; Furniss, 60; Kelly, 91.&lt;/ref&gt; and repeatedly argues that Britain's problems are rooted in the inequity of property distribution. Although she did not advocate a totally equal [[distribution of wealth]], she did desire one that was more equitable.&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republicanism===
[[File:Shepherd-vernet.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Landscape painting, showing a mountain scene with an adoring couple surrounded by sheep in the foreground. The scene is dominated by a large, leafy green tree at the left and blue sky with white clouds, contrasted against the mountain at the top of the painting.|''Shepherd in the Alps'' by [[Claude Joseph Vernet]]; an idyllic rural life is part of the political utopia Wollstonecraft depicts in the ''Rights of Men''.]]

The ''Rights of Men'' indicts monarchy and hereditary distinctions and promotes a [[republicanism|republican]] ideology. Relying on 17th- and early 18th-century notions of republicanism, Wollstonecraft maintains that virtue is at the core of citizenship. However, her notion of virtue is more individualistic and moralistic than traditional [[Commonwealth men|Commonwealth]] ideology. The goals of Wollstonecraft's republicanism are the happiness and prosperity of the individual, not the greatest good for the greatest number or the greatest benefits for the propertied.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 43; Sapiro, xx; Johnson, 25; Kelly, 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; While she emphasizes the benefits that will accrue to the individual under republicanism, she also maintains that reform can only be effected at a societal level. This marks a change from her earlier texts, such as ''[[Original Stories from Real Life]]'' (1788), in which the individual plays the primary role in social reform.&lt;ref name="Todd166"&gt;Todd, 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wollstonecraft's ideas of virtue revolved around the family, distinguishing her from other republicans such as [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] and [[William Godwin]].&lt;ref name="Jones446"&gt;Jones, 44–46.&lt;/ref&gt; For Wollstonecraft, virtue begins in the home: private virtues are the foundation for public virtues.&lt;ref name="multiref2"&gt;Sapiro, 216.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau's]] depictions of the ideal family and the republican [[Swiss canton]], she draws a picture of idyllic family life in a small country village.&lt;ref name="Jones446"/&gt;  One scholar describes her plan this way: "vast estates would be divided into small farms, cottagers would be allowed to make enclosures from the commons and, instead of alms being given to the poor, they would be given the means to independence and self-advancement."&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals would learn and practice virtue in the home, virtue that would not only make them self-sufficient, but also prompt them to feel responsible for the citizens of their society.

===Tradition versus revolution===
One of the central arguments of Wollstonecraft's ''Rights of Men'' is that rights should be conferred because they are reasonable and just, not because they are traditional.&lt;ref name="W434"/&gt; While Burke argued that civil society and government should rely on traditions which had accrued over centuries, Wollstonecraft contends that all civil agreements are subject to rational reassessment. Precedence, she maintains, is no reason to accept a law or a constitution. As one scholar puts it, "Burke's belief in the antiquity of the British constitution and the impossibility of improvement upon a system that has been tried and tested through time is dismissed as nonsense. The past, for Wollstonecraft, is a scene of superstition, oppression, and ignorance."&lt;ref&gt;Furniss, 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft believed powerfully in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] notion of progress, and rejected the contention that ancient ideas could not be improved upon.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 164; Kelly, 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt; Using Burke's own architectural language, she asks, "why was it a duty to repair an ancient castle, built in barbarous ages, of Gothic materials?"&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 75.&lt;/ref&gt; She also notes, pointedly, that Burke's philosophy condones [[slavery]]:&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 209; Kelly, 92.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=
[T]he whole tenor of his plausible arguments settles slavery on an everlasting foundation. Allowing his servile reverence for antiquity, and prudent attention to self-interest, to have the force which he insists on, the slave trade ought never to be abolished; and, because our ignorant forefathers, not understanding the native dignity of man, sanctioned a traffic that outrages every suggestion of reason and religion, we are to submit to the inhuman custom, and term an atrocious insult to humanity the love of our country, and a proper submission to the laws by which our property is secured.—Security of property! Behold, in a few words, the definition of English liberty. And to this selfish principle every nobler one is sacrificed.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sensibility==
[[File:MA-Lebrun.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Three-quarter length portrait of a woman wearing a large straw hat with grayish-blue ostrich feathers and a ruffly cream dress with a gold bow tied at the waist in the back. She is arranging a group of pink flowers.|[[Marie Antoinette]], painted by [[Élisabeth-Louise Vigée-Le Brun]] (1783); Wollstonecraft attacks Burke for his self-indulgent sympathy for the French queen.]]

In the ''Rights of Men'', Wollstonecraft not only endorses [[republicanism]], but also a social contract based on sympathy and fellow-feeling.&lt;ref name="Jones446"/&gt; She describes the ideal society in these terms: individuals, supported by cohesive families, connect with others through rational sympathy.&lt;ref name="Jones446"/&gt; Strongly influenced by Price, whom she had met at [[Newington Green]] just a few years earlier, Wollstonecraft asserts that people should strive to imitate God by practicing universal benevolence.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Embracing a reasoned [[sensibility]], Wollstonecraft contrasts her theory of civil society with Burke's, which she describes as full of pomp and circumstance and riddled with prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 48; Myers, 125–26.&lt;/ref&gt; She attacks what she perceives as Burke's false feeling, countering with her own genuine emotion. She argues that to be sympathetic to the French revolution (i.e., the people) is humane while to sympathize with the French clergy, as Burke does, is a mark of inhumanity.&lt;ref&gt;Furniss, 62; Kelly, 97.&lt;/ref&gt; She accuses Burke not only of insincerity, but also of manipulation, claiming that his ''Reflections'' is propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 163; Sapiro, 201–205.&lt;/ref&gt; In one of the most dramatic moments of the ''Rights of Men'', Wollstonecraft claims to be moved beyond Burke's tears for [[Marie Antoinette]] and the monarchy of France to silence for the injustice suffered by slaves, a silence she represents with dashes meant to express feelings more authentic than Burke's:&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=
Man preys on man; and you mourn for the idle tapestry that decorated a gothic pile, and the dronish bell that summoned the fat priest to prayer. You mourn for the empty pageant of a name, when slavery flaps her wing, and the sick heart retires to die in lonely wilds, far from the abodes of men....Why is our fancy to be appalled by terrific perspectives of a hell beyond the grave?—Hell stalks abroad;—the lash resounds on the slave's naked sides; and the sick wretch, who can no longer earn the sour bread of unremitting labour, steals to a ditch to bid the world a long good night—or, neglected in some ostentatious hospital, breathes his last amidst the laugh of mercenary attendants.

Such misery demands more than tears—I pause to recollect myself; and smother the contempt I feel rising for your rhetorical flourishes and infantine sensibility.

&lt;nowiki&gt;---------------&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;---------------&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender and aesthetics==
[[File:MaryWollstonecraft.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Half-length portrait of a woman leaning on a desk with a book and an inkstand. She is wearing a blue-striped dress and a gray, curly wig crossed by a white band of cloth.|[[Mary Wollstonecraft]], painted by [[John Opie]] (c. 1791)]]

In the ''Rights of Men'', Wollstonecraft challenges Burke's rhetoric as much as, or more, than his political theory. She begins by redefining the ''[[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]'' and the ''beautiful'', terms he had established in his ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful|Enquiry into the Sublime and Beautiful]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 26; Sapiro, 121–22; Kelly, 90; 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt; While Burke associates the beautiful with weakness and femininity, and the sublime with strength and masculinity, Wollstonecraft writes, "for truth, in morals, has ever appeared to me the essence of the sublime; and, in taste, simplicity the only criterion of the beautiful."&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 35.&lt;/ref&gt; With this sentence, she calls into question Burke's gendered definitions; convinced that they are harmful, she argues later in the ''Rights of Men'':
{{quote|text=
You may have convinced [women] that littleness and weakness are the very essence of beauty; and that the Supreme Being, in giving women beauty in the most supereminent {{sic}} degree, seemed to command them, by the powerful voice of Nature, not to cultivate the moral virtues that might chance to excite respect, and interfere with the pleasing sensations they were created to inspire. Thus confining truth, fortitude, and humanity, within the rigid pale of manly morals, they might justly argue, that to be loved, woman's high end and great distinction! they should 'learn to lisp, to totter in their walk, and nick-name God's creatures.' Never, they might repeat after you, was any man, much less a woman, rendered amiable by the force of those exalted qualities, fortitude, justice, wisdom, and truth; and thus forewarned of the sacrifice they must make to those austere, unnatural virtues, they would be authorised to turn all their attention to their persons, systematically neglecting morals to secure beauty.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft,  ''Vindications'', 80.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
As Wollstonecraft scholar [[Claudia L. Johnson (scholar)|Claudia Johnson]] has written, "As feminist critique, these passages have never really been surpassed."&lt;ref name="multiref1"/&gt; Burke, Wollstonecraft maintains, describes womanly virtue as weakness, thus leaving women no substantive roles in the public sphere and relegating them to uselessness.&lt;ref&gt;Poovey, 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wollstonecraft applies this feminist critique to Burke's language throughout the ''Reflections''. As Johnson argues, "her pamphlet as a whole refutes the Burkean axiom 'to make us love our country, our country ought to be lovely'"; Wollstonecraft successfully challenges Burke's rhetoric of the beautiful with the rhetoric of the rational.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 27; see also Myers, 127–28; Kelly, 90.&lt;/ref&gt; She also demonstrates how Burke embodies the worst of his own ideas. He becomes the hysterical, illogical, feminine writer, and Wollstonecraft becomes the rational, masculine writer. Ironically, in order to effect this transposition, Wollstonecraft herself becomes passionate at times, for example, in her description of slavery (quoted above).&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 163; Taylor, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
[[File:WollstonecraftMacaulayLetter.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Handwritten letter reads "Madam Now I venture to send you [cut out] with a name utterly unknown to you in the [?], it is necessary to apologize for thus intruding on you—but instead of an apology shall I tell you the truth? You are the only female writer who I consider in opinion with respecting the [?] our sex ought to endeavour to attain the world. I respect Mrs. Macaulay Graham because she contends for [?] whilst most of her sex only seeks for flowers. I am Madam, Yours respectually, Mary Wollstonecraft Thursday Morning."|Letter sent by [[Mary Wollstonecraft|Wollstonecraft]] to [[Catharine Macaulay]] along with a copy of the ''Rights of Men'']]

The ''Rights of Men'' was successful, its price contributing in no small measure: at one shilling and sixpence it was half the price of Burke's book.&lt;ref name="Todd166"/&gt; After the first edition sold out, Wollstonecraft agreed to have her name printed on the title page of the second. It was her first extensive work as "a self-supporting professional and self-proclaimed intellectual", as scholar Mary Poovey writes, and:
{{quote|text=
took the form that most people would have considered the least appropriate for a woman—the political disquisition. Requiring knowledge of government (in which women had no share), analytical ability (of which women theoretically had little), and the ambition to participate directly in contemporary events (of which women were supposed to have none), political disquisition was in every sense a masculine domain.&lt;ref&gt;Poovey, 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
Commentaries from the time note this; [[Horace Walpole, 4th Earl of Orford|Horace Walpole]], for example, called her a "hyena in petticoats" for attacking Marie Antoinette. [[William Godwin]], her future husband, described the book as illogical and ungrammatical; in his ''[[Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman|Memoirs]]'' of Wollstonecraft, he dedicated only a paragraph to a discussion of the content of the work, calling it "intemperate".&lt;ref&gt;Godwin, 73; see also Todd, 168; Sapiro, 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

All the major periodicals of the day reviewed the ''Rights of Men''. The ''[[Analytical Review]]'' agreed with Wollstonecraft's arguments and praised her "lively and animated remarks".&lt;ref name="Wardle1201"&gt;Wardle, 120–21.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Monthly Review'' was also sympathetic, but it pointed out faults in her writing. The ''Critical Review'', the "sworn foe" of the  ''Analytical Review'',&lt;ref name="Wardle1201"/&gt; however, wrote in December 1790, after discovering that the author was a woman:
{{quote|text=
It has been observed in an old play, that minds have no sex; and in truth we did not discover this Defender of the Rights of ''Man'' to be a ''Woman''. The second edition, however, which often reveals secrets, has attributed this pamphlet to Mrs. Wollstonecraft, and if she assumes the disguise of a man, she must not be surprised that she is not treated with the civility and respect that she would have received in her own person. As the article was written before we saw the second edition, we have presented an acknowledgement of this kind to the necessary alterations. It would not have been sufficient to have corrected merely verbal errors: a Lady should have been addressed with more respect. [emphasis in original]&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Kelly, 101–102.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
The ''[[Gentleman's Magazine]]'' followed suit, criticizing the book's logic and "its absurd presumption that men will be happier if free", as well as Wollstonecraft's own presumption in writing on topics outside of her proper domain, commenting "the ''rights of men'' asserted by a fair lady! The age of chivalry cannot be over, or the sexes have changed their ground."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Todd, 472, n.34; see also Wardle, 121.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''Rights of Men'' put Wollstonecraft on the map as a writer; from this point forward in her career, she was well known.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, 113; Kelly, 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wollstonecraft sent a copy of the book to the historian [[Catharine Macaulay]], whom she greatly admired. Macaulay wrote back that she was "still more highly pleased that this publication which I have so greatly admired from its pathos &amp; sentiment should have been written by a woman and thus to see my opinion of the powers and talents of the sex in your pen so early verified."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Todd, 167.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Roscoe]], a Liverpool lawyer, writer, and patron of the arts, liked the book so much that he included Wollstonecraft in his satirical poem ''The Life, Death, and Wonderful Achievements of Edmund Burke'':

[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|alt=Men with guns being led by a half-naked woman who is holding the French flag. She and they are walking over dead bodies. The painting is structured like a triangle, with the woman at the apex. The dead are lying at the base of the triangle.|thumb|250px|right|''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' by [[Eugène Delacroix]] (1833)]]

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
And lo! an amazon stept out,
  One WOLLSTONECRAFT her name,
Resolv'd to stop his mad career,
  Whatever chance became.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Sapiro, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

While most of the early reviewers of the ''Rights of Men'', as well as most of Wollstonecraft's early biographers, criticized the work's emotionalism, and juxtaposed it with Burke's masterpiece of logic, there has been a recent re-evaluation of her text. Since the 1970s, critics who have looked more closely at both her work and Burke's, have come to the conclusion that they share many rhetorical similarities, and that the masculine/logic and feminine/emotion binaries are unsupportable.&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 25; 186–87.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Wollstonecraft scholars now recognize it was this work that radicalized Wollstonecraft and directed her future writings, particularly ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]''. It is not until after the halfway point of ''Rights of Men'' that she begins the dissection of Burke's gendered aesthetic; as Claudia Johnson contends, "it seems that in the act of writing the later portions of ''Rights of Men'' she discovered the subject that would preoccupy her for the rest of her career."&lt;ref name="Johnson26"/&gt;

Two years later, when Wollstonecraft published the ''Rights of Woman'', she extended many of the arguments she had begun in ''Rights of Men''. If all people should be judged on their merits, she wrote, women should be included in that group.&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; In both texts, Wollstonecraft emphasizes that the virtue of the British nation is dependent on the virtue of its people. To a great extent, she collapses the distinction between private and public and demands that all educated citizens be offered the chance to participate in the public sphere.&lt;ref name="multiref2"/&gt;

'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Montenegro]], access to information is a right guaranteed by the Constitution and regulated under the law. Montenegro first adopted the Law on Free Access to Information in 2005; in 2013 a new law entered into force, providing a better standard of protection for freedom of information than the previous legal act.&lt;ref name=MANS&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |title=Freedom of information in Montenegro. Analysis of the Legal Framework, Practice and Implementation of ECHR Case Law and other International Standards with Recommendations for Improvement |url=http://www.mans.co.me/en/wp-content/uploads/fai/FreedomOfInformation-Internship.pdf |publisher=MANS. Network for Affirmation of NGO Sector  |issue= |access-date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite some positive developments achieved with the adoption of the new Law, Montenegro still has problems with its implementation.&lt;ref name=BIRN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/montenegro-ngo-doubts-govt-s-plan-to-open-public-records-04-01-2016 |title=Montenegro Plan to Open Public Records Doubted |last= |first= |date=1 April 2016 |website=Balkaninsight.com |publisher= BalkanInsight |access-date=9 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, Montenegro started the process of reforming the current law: a draft proposal was formulated by the Culture of Ministry in 2016 following some pressure from the [[European Union]] to align Montenegrin legislation with EU standards.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt;

==Legal framework==
The Constitution of Montenegro states, in Article 51, that everyone shall have the right of access to public information held by state authorities and organisations exercising public functions.&lt;ref name=MANS/&gt; Furthermore, the '''2013 Law on Free Access to Information''' establishes a precise procedure for obtaining public information. The law entitles any natural or legal person the right to access information held in any form by state and local authorities, public companies and other entities which exercise public functions. Public authorities have 15 working days for deciding on the disclosure of a required information.&lt;ref name=MANS/&gt;

The new law introduced a new supervisory body, called Agency for the Protection of Personal Data and Free Access to Information which works on the appeal process of freedom of information requests.&lt;ref name=MANS/&gt; Another positive development in the 2013 law is the introduction of fines to be imposed upon public bodies which fail to fulfill with their duties with regard to access to information.&lt;ref name=MANS/&gt;

==Access to public information in practice==
According to the 2016 [[European Commission]] Progress Report on Montenegro, the law on Access to public information lack effective monitoring and supervision.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt; According to the newspaper [[Vijesti]], the experience of journalists and NGOs in the country shows that, despite FOI legal provisions, in practice it is difficult to get information of public importance. &lt;ref name=OBCT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/aree/Montenegro/Montenegro-i-silenzi-della-pubblica-amministrazione-177586 |title=Montenegro: i silenzi della pubblica amministrazione |last=Čađenović |first=Ivan |date=10 February 2017 |website=balcanicaucaso.org |publisher=Osservatorio Balcani Caucasto Transeuropa / Vijesti |access-date=21 February 2017 |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last years the proportion of requests refused by public authorities in Montenegro improved from 24% in 2014 to 18% in 2015. Also, the 2016 budget of the Agency for the Protection of Personal Data and Access to Information was increased by 50%.&lt;ref name="EC"&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |title=Montenegro 2016 Report |url=https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/pdf/key_documents/2016/20161109_report_montenegro.pdf  |publisher=European Commission |access-date=9 February  2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The limited capacity and resources of the Agency was an issue of concern for some NGOs advocating for access to information.&lt;ref name="MANS" /&gt;

In 2015, out of a total of 4.434 requests for access to information, the information requested was not provided in 805 cases.&lt;ref name="EC" /&gt; The Agency for Personal Data Protection and Free Access to Information received a total of 1.431 complaints in 2015. The majority of cases received by the Agency concerned [[administrative silence]]: in these cases the request remained unanswered.&lt;ref name="EC" /&gt;

The majority of FOI requests, around 70%, are filed by NGOs, among which stands the NGO MANS.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt; This data shows the low awareness and knowledge by the general public of the right of access to information and its legal provisions.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt; In the majority of cases applicants are get the required information with large delays, beyond the time frame established by the law, and often after having filed a complaint to the Ombudsbam.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt;

Another issue of concern is that court decisions on cases concerning access to information are not effectively enforced.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt; The report of the EC also points out that in some cases public authorities in Montenegro seem to abuse the possibility of declaring requested documents confidential in order to avoid their disclosure.&lt;ref name="EC" /&gt; Indeed, according to the NGO MANS, the law includes a series of unnecessary reasons for exceptions for limiting disclosure. The formulation of the exceptions enshrined in the law seems to be too vague and too general, thus giving room for public institutions to interpret it in a way that restricts access to information.&lt;ref name="MANS" /&gt;

Another reason of concern is the high percentage of requests that remain unanswered.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;

According to the [[Balkan Insight|Balkan Investigative Reporting Network]] (BIRN), problems in realizing the right of access to public information arise in particular when journalists and NGOs seek information about the privatization process or seek information that could potentially reveal cases of corruption or illegal activity. &lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt; &lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2015 |title=Montenegro 2015 Human Rights Report. Executive Summary |url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/253093.pdf |publisher=US State Department|access-date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the NGO MANS, the respect of the law on access to public information is particularly problematic when it comes to make public information concerning enterprises where the State owns the majority of shares.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt;

The EC Progress Report recommends to enhance the implementation of the law especially in corruption-prone cases.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;

'''Anarchist law''' is a hypothetical body of norms regarding behavior and decision-making that might be operative in an anarchist community. The term is used in  a series of ongoing debates within the various branches of [[anarchist]] theory regarding if and how norms of individual and/or collective behavior, [[decision-making]] and actions should be created and enforced.

The '''Asia Commons''' is an attempt to see how ideas of the [[Commons]] are specifically applicable to [[Asia]]n conditions, and may be distinctive from other forms.

It is also the name of a conference, held in early June 2006 in [[Bangkok]], the capital in [[Thailand]].  The event was attended by over a hundred people, mostly from Asia.

==The Concept of an 'Asia Commons'==

There are some theses on why the [[Commons]] idea in Asia would be different from those elsewhere. For example: 
* common village land is still in existence in Asia, not in the West;
* the problems of access are more serious in most Asian countries;
* unauthorized copying/sharing of software, music and audio CDs or DVDs is more common than in the West.
 
More specifically, the term Asia Commons is the movement to create and sustain the Commons in Asia.

== The Commons, as a concept ==

There are many type of commons, but the focus could be divided basically into two—natural resources, and man-made resources.

The commons is: 
* any common resource that is available to all (but can be defined locally, or specifically as 'everybody in category x')
* a series of specific institutional formats used to manage such
* the movement that promotes them.

The open/free, [[participatory]]/p2p, and commons are a related the three-legged stool of paradigms: 
* ''Free and open'' - ensures access to the raw material to build the common
* ''Participatory'' - refers to the process of broad participation in order to actually build it
* The commons is the ''institutional format'' - used to prevent private appropriation of said creations
* ''Cyclical'' - The circle is closed when commons-generated material is again free/open raw material for the next cycle of the circulation of the commons.

==The Asia Commons Conference: June 6–8, 2006==

Asia Commons, or the Asian Conference on the Digital Commons, was a conference held between June 6 to 8, 2006 in Bangkok, Thailand. Its website says that during the past two decades, the "''level, scope, territorial extent, and role of copyrights and patents have expanded into new sectors, often without development considerations''".&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20070928191031/http://www.asia-commons.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference discussed issues pertaining to the Asian Digital Commons, [[free software|Free/Libre and Open Source Software]], business models and collaborative models, Intellectual Property Rights, patents, copyrights, copylefts, the grey economy and its impact on the Asian "developing world", ideas of the Creative Commons, alternate law practices, [[A2K|access to knowledge (a2k)]], Open Access, open alternatives, peer-to-peer (P2P) practices and open standards.

===Goal, purpose===

The Asia Commons event was aimed at creating "many opportunities where deep discussions and exchange can happen". The conference organisers said they "recognise that all participants have experience and ideas that are relevant and as a result, expect them to contribute to the discussions on issues and topics of interest."

Organisers said (in a conference kit presented to participants) that through an exchange of experience and knowledge, the Asia Commons conference aimed at bringing participants together to:

* Increase understanding of the effects of copyrights and patents, specially software patents, on access to knowledge and culture in Asia.
* Conceptualise locally-relevant models for collaborative creation and dissemination of knowledge and culture.
* Enhance partnerships to build collaboration through collaborative projects.
* Identify information gaps and further areas of research.
* Contribute towards the production of material for wider dissemination and decision-making.

===Participation===

Some 137 participants were listed to take part in the event. They came in from a range of countries from Asia ([[Bangladesh]], [[Cambodia]], China, [[Hong Kong]] (PRC), India, [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Mongolia]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]], [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]],  [[Sri Lanka]], [[Taiwan]], [[Thailand]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Vietnam]]) and beyond (Australia, [[Brazil]], Canada, [[Chile]], [[Ecuador]], [[Fiji]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Ghana]], Israel, [[Kenya]], [[Malawi]], [[South Africa]], [[Uganda]], UK, the United States, [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]]).

===Speakers===

Some of the speakers included [[Peter Drahos]] of the [[Australian National University]] and [[James Love (NGO director)|Jamie Love]] of the [[Consumer Project on Technology]], both of whom were joint keynote speakers. [[Bangalore]] based lawyer of the [http://www.altlawforum.org Alternate Law Forum] [https://web.archive.org/web/20060822150554/http://wikis.bellanet.org/asia-commons/index.php/Lawrence_Liang Lawrence Liang], independent writer and researcher [https://web.archive.org/web/20060822205601/http://wikis.bellanet.org/asia-commons/index.php/Vijayalakshmi_Balakrishnan Vijayalakshmi Balakrishnan] of New Delhi, [https://web.archive.org/web/20060822090910/http://wikis.bellanet.org/asia-commons/index.php/Dr._N.S._Gopalakrishanan Dr N.S.

The participatory spectogram session on "Patents and Innovation" included as keynote speakers, FOSS advocate [https://web.archive.org/web/20060822150841/http://wikis.bellanet.org/asia-commons/index.php/Fouad_Riaz_Bajwa Fouad Riaz Bajwa] of [https://web.archive.org/web/20060804082653/http://fossfp.org/ Free and Open Source Foundation of Pakistan (FOSSFP)] and advocate [https://web.archive.org/web/20060614153420/http://wikis.bellanet.org/asia-commons/index.php/Rahul_Matthan Rahul Matthan] of [[Trilegal]], India with the session led by [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20110718234259/http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-63152-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html Laurent Elder] of [[International Development Research Centre|IDRC]].

There were sessions on "History of the Commons, Evolution of Copyright and the Emergence of the Digital Economy: Exploring the Relationships", "Copyright and the Information Grey Economy: A Regional Comparison", "Patents and Innovation", and "Open Business Models".

Using the "speed sharing" model, there was also a session on collaborative projects. Each speaker, talked to small groups of participants, and had just three minutes in which to explain their work and concepts. This was followed by a session of 'round tables' on the issue of collaborative models: factors that lead to successful collaborations, opportunities and challenges.

Towards the end, the focus shifted to building an overview of the Asia Commons—ideas and issues, issues and opportunities, what could be done to move forward, and what is being moved forward.

===Organisers===

This event was organised at the Chaophya Park Hotel and organised by [[Bellanet|Bellanet International Secretariat]], the Delhi-based [[Centre for Science, Development and Media Studies (CSDMS)]], [[South Asia Partnership International]], and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] [[Asia Pacific Development Information Programme]]'s [[International Open Source Network]] (IOSN).

This event was financially supported by the [[International Development Research Centre|International Development Research Centre (IDRC)]] of Canada and UNDP APDIP's [[International Open Source Network]] (IOSN). Local partners in organising the event were the [[Asian Institute of Technology]] based in Bangkok and the [[Thai Rural Net]] (TRN).

It was a [[Global Knowledge Partnership]] (GKP) members' event.

===Open Space===

This event used the 'open space' approach to focus on issues of relevance.

As defined [[Open Space Technology|elsewhere]] in the Wikipedia: "Open Space Technology enables groups of any size to address complex, important issues and achieve meaningful results quickly. It is at its best where more traditional meeting formats fail: when there is conflict, complexity, diversity of thought or people and short decision times. It has been used in widely diverse settings, from designing airplane doors at a large airplane manufacturing company to engaging street kids in defining a sustainable jobs program. Originated by Harrison Owen in 1986, Open Space has been used in over 100 countries and in diverse settings, industries, cultures and situations - for program and product design, knowledge exchange, interdisciplinary thinking, conflict resolution and conferences."

Organisers of the event were quoted as saying that [https://web.archive.org/web/20071020234236/http://www.asia-commons.net/asiaopenspace they had doubts] whether the Open Space approach would be suitable in Asia. But it was.

===Emergent issues ===

One of the issues to emerge from the meeting was a regional (Asia-wide) focus on  Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS, or FOSS). Diosdado "Dong" Calmada of the Philippines held a session with this concern. He was keen to look at why Asia had so many GNU/Linux user groups, but seldom seemed to  care about the big picture. This region, he suggested, was too concerned about its own technical problems. "There's a need to broaden the perspective of our groups. After all, LUGs (Linux-user groups) are potent forces," he was quoted as saying. It was felt that Asia, with all its tech skills and software talent, is all but invisible in the world of Free Software and Open Source. People do not link up with one another, within countries or across borders. There's little communication happening within the otherwise successful FOSS movement across this vast continent.

[[Michel Bauwens]] of the [http://www.p2pfoundation.net P2PFoundation], which has a wide variety of links to P2P or peer-to-peer networking examples, explained his perspective saying, "The basic idea I had was that there's a new social movement emerging, which is really about extending the realm of participation to the whole of life. We live in a representative democracy, which says you can vote every four years, and choose which people who exercise power on your behalf... now we're building tools and resources which say everybody needs to be involved, and everybody should have a voice (in other areas too, apart from just voting)."

[[Paola di Maio]], another participant, narrated her experiences in deploying technology to cope with the fury of nature, as reflected in the December 26, 2004 [[Asian tsunami]]. She commented: "Our emergency collaboration model emerged after we became familiar with the tsunami. I was in Thailand then. My internet was working but all the phone were down. So I got online via my tiny mobile, and was looking for information. We knew something big had happened, but there was simply no news emerging. One or two hours after the wave hit, there were headlines reporting an 'earthquake'."

Sacha of [[Indymedia]] in the US shared his group's experience with building alternatives from the grassroots. Currently, the [[Indymedia]] global network of participatory journalism has local units in 160 cities in 80 countries, and every continent. He said: "Indymedia was created in 1999 to cover the WTO ([[World Trade Organization|World Trade Organisation]]) Ministerial and protests against it in Seattle. There were some 5000 activists taking part. Many strands from the [[Global Justice Movement]] joined in."

[[Lawrence Liang]], a lawyer trained at the prestigious [[National Law School of India]], had a session along with others on "countering IP propaganda". [[Ronaldo Lemos]] from [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s [[Fundação Getúlio Vargas]] school of law referred to [[Yochai Benkler]]'s book, ''[[The Wealth of Networks]]''. He also pointed to [[Jimmy Wales]], who has said that in the foreseeable future there would be 12 fields that would become free. These things are: the encyclopedia, the dictionary, academic curriculum, music, art in general, file formats, maps, product identifiers, search engines, production made by communities, TV listings, academic publishing. [[Ronaldo Lemos]] felt that things lacking in this list included news and software.

Said Delhi-based independent writer and researcher Vijayalakshmi "Viju" Balakrishnan: "In Asia, the history of (colonial) trade has largely been sea-based trade. And the language and philosophy now governing the way cyberspace is being controlled has strong parallels to what we saw in the seventeenth century. Free trade has functioned through pirate-based models. There were cartels or guild-power. For us in India it was the East India Company. For our friends in South East Asia, it was the VOC or the Dutch East India Company. Today, it is the Wintel (Windows-Intel) combo. In comparison to the state-control model of the past, we now have the story of how Google enters China."

A number of other issues also emerged from the conference, which are aptly captured in the conference [https://web.archive.org/web/20060813091257/http://access5.bellanet.org/asia-commons.net/arc/participants discussion list], [http://wikis.bellanet.org/asia-commons wiki]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} and multiple blogs.

}}'''The Burial Act 1857''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It is one of the [[Burial Acts 1852 to 1885]]. Its purpose is to regulate [[burial ground]]s.  It regulates where and how [[deceased]] people may be [[Burial|buried]], and provides for the [[exhumation]] of remains. The Act made it illegal to disturb a grave (other than for an officially sanctioned exhumation). The Act did not make it illegal to steal a dead body, and it is only the opening of the grave which constitutes an offence, not the removal of the contents.

== Guidance for Burial Ground Managers ==
The Government Department for Constitutional Affairs provides guidance for burial ground managers, and many aspect of it relate to provisions contained in the Burial Act 1857.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/326370/burial-ground-managers.pdf|title=Guide for Burial Ground Managers|last=Department for Constitutional Affairs|first=|date=2006|website=Gov.UK|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Disturbing a Burial and Exhumation ==
Concerns arose that due to pressures of population movement to urban areas during the [[Industrial Revolution in the United Kingdom|Industrial revolution]] that burial graves were reused too quickly&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/may/17/nation-cemeteries-full-graves|title=The nation's cemeteries are nearly full|last=Edemariam|first=Aida|date=17 May 2011|website=The Guardian|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The offence of disturbing a burial included in the Burial Act 1857 was based on the Victorian value that a burial was for eternity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Section 25 of the Burial Act 1857 makes it unlawful in England and Wales to disturb human burials except without a licence from the Secretary of State, or on ground consecrated by the rites of the [[Church of England]], without the permission of the church.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The mechanisms about how the Church of England provides this permission slightly differs depending if the remains are at a church or cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.churchcare.co.uk/cathedrals/getting-advice/human-remains|title=Human Remains|last=Locke|first=Anne|date=2017|website=www.churchcare.co.uk|language=en-gb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In Scotland, the law is different and covered by the Burial and Cremations Act (Scotland) Act 2016.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN04060/SN04060.pdf|title=Reuse of Graves.

== Viewpoint of Licencing Authorities on Exhumation ==
The Blagdon Cemetery [2002] [[Court of arches|Court of Arches]] case is the basis of the Church of England exhumation guidelines. The viewpoint of the Church of England is burial is final and only grants exhumation in exceptional circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dioceseofnorwich.org/churches/registry/churchyards/exhumation/|title=Exhumation|last=The Church of England Diocese of Norwich|first=|date=2018|website=The Church of England Diocese of Norwich|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Advisory Panel on the Archaeology of Burials in England is a partnership between [[Historic England]], and the Church of England providing guidance based on the law, [[archaeological]] research, and [[theology]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archaeologyuk.org/apabe/pdf/APABE_ToHREfCBG_FINAL_WEB.pdf|title=Guidance for Best Practice for the Treatment of Human Remains Excavated from Christian Burial Grounds in England.

== Modern amendments ==

In 2004, the Government, in response to the problem of the lack of space for new burials, partly a consequence of the Burial Act 1857, held a consultation called, “Burial Law and Policy in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Century”. The consultation considered how to address the problem that when a burial ground became full, it generated no income from new burials, and without income, it may become difficult to maintain and fall into neglect.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/620092674|title=The matter of death : space, place and materiality|last=Woodthorpe|first=Kate|date=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2010|isbn=9780230224162|editor-last=Hockey|editor-first=Jennifer Lorna|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|pages=117-132|chapter=Private Grief in Public Spaces. Interpreting Memorialisation in the Contemporary Cemetery|oclc=620092674|editor-last2=Komaromy|editor-first2=Carol|editor-last3=Woodthorpe|editor-first3=Kate}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

London Burial Authorities in some instances could reclaim and reuse a grave after 75 years, under the London Authorities Act 2007. Extending this provision elsewhere in the country was deliberated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The consultation considered the ‘Exclusive Rights for Burial’. When purchasing a grave, a person usually buys the right to exclusive be buried in it for a period, often 100 years, they do not buy the land. Noted was the possibility of reusing graves with the permission of the Church of England. Section 25 of the Burial Act 1857, amended by Section 2 of the Church of England (Miscellaneous Provisions) Measures 2014 permitted the disturbance of graves with Church of England permission.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Successive Government have considered the problem of lack of space for graves but not taken at this time taken any action. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The 2015 amendments to the Burial Act 1857, allowing the Church of England to reuse graves, was controversial. Such changes have been criticised as offensive and distressing to the living, and disrespectful to the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.burtonmail.co.uk/news/local-news/tutbury-church-reuse-graves-dead-1267256|title=Church to reuse old graves as it struggles for burial space|last=Kreft|first=Helen|date=6 March 2018|work=Burton Main|access-date=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Canada Gazette''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Gazette du Canada'''}}) is the official newspaper of the [[Government of Canada]].&lt;ref name=Collections&gt;{{cite web|last=Kennedy|first=Carole|title=A Glance at the Canada Gazette: Past, Present and Future|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/gazette-du-canada/035001-2000-e.html|work=Library and Archives Canada|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published on October 2, 1841.&lt;ref name="The Canada Gazette"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deavy|first=Betty|author2=Gauld, Norma|title=The Canada Gazette|journal=Canadian Parliamentary Review|date=1994|volume=17|issue=2|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/Infoparl/english/issue.asp?param=149&amp;art=1005|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While originally it published all acts of the [[Parliament of Canada]], it later also published treaties, hearing and tribunals, proclamations and regulations, and various other official notices as required.&lt;ref name=Collections /&gt;  At one time it contained information on bankruptcies.&lt;ref name="The Canada Gazette" /&gt; It has been administered by [[Public Works and Government Services Canada]] and the [[Queen's Printer]] since 1841. The ''Gazette'' is most often read to find new acts, regulations and proclamations.&lt;ref name="The Canada Gazette" /&gt;

==Legal status==
While not always widely read by the public, publication in the ''Gazette'' is considered official notice to all Canadians. After a regulation has been approved by the [[Privy Council Office (Canada)|Privy Council Office]] and then the [[Cabinet of Canada]], the regulation is published in the ''Gazette''.&lt;ref name="Can Review"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bernhardt|first=Peter|title=Understanding the Regulation Making Process|url=http://www.revparl.ca/english/issue.asp?art=245&amp;param=82|work=Canadian Parliamentary Review|accessdate=7 February 2014|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a regulation has not been published in the ''Gazette'', a person cannot be convicted of the offence.&lt;ref name=SIA&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title=Statutory Instruments Act|year=1985|section=11|subsection=2|abbr=RSO|chapter=S-22|link=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/S-22/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada's [[provinces of Canada|provinces]] all have their own equivalents of the ''Gazette''.

==Publishing==
From inception in 1841 until 1998, the ''Gazette'' was published in print. From 1998 until 1 April 2014, it was published in print and online, with the online version having the same official status as the printed version starting in 2003.&lt;ref name=Collections /&gt; From 1 April 2014 onwards, it will only be published online to satisfy a Government of Canada requirement to make "electronic publishing its new standard for all documents".&lt;ref name="online"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gazette.gc.ca/news-nouvelles/news-nouvelles-2014-02-28-eng.html|title=Discontinuance of the Printed Copy of the Canada Gazette — Reminder|publisher=Canada Gazette Directorate|date=28 February 2014|accessdate=13 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303200747/http://www.gazette.gc.ca/news-nouvelles/news-nouvelles-2014-02-28-eng.html|archivedate=3 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/media/nr-cp/2013/0705-eng.asp|title=Government of Canada moves to e-printing|publisher=Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat|date=5 July 2013|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Structurally, the ''Gazette'' is published in three parts:

===Part I===
Part I is published each Saturday. It contains public notices, official appointments and proposed regulations, as well as miscellaneous notices from the private sector that are required to be published by federal statute or by regulations. The proposed regulations are published in Part I as a way for the public to comment on them. Once the regulations are pre-published, the department that sponsored the legislation collects public comments to allow for any changes to be made to the regulation.&lt;ref name="Can Review" /&gt; Recently, Notices of Vacancies for senior positions in Government are published here too.&lt;ref name="The Canada Gazette" /&gt;

===Part II===
Part II is published every second Wednesday and it contains all regulations that have been enacted as well as statutory instruments and other documents, such as orders in council, orders and proclamations. It has a consolidated index of regulations dating since January 1, 1955.

===Part III===
Part III is published with the text of any new laws immediately after they have received [[Royal Assent]] and was first published in 1974.  Starting from January 1998 all  publications other than Part III are available in [[HTML]] and are not official.  From  April 1, 2003, the [[PDF]] version is an official version, as it is marked up from the same file as the printed version. It also contains a list of the proclamations of Canada and orders in council relating to the coming into force of federal acts.

==Exemptions==
Certain types of regulations do not need to be published in the ''Gazette''. These include regulations that affect only a limited number of people, their publication would be contrary to national defense or international relations, or if their publication would violate personal privacy, such as notices of paroles and pardons.&lt;ref name="The Canada Gazette" /&gt;

The '''casebook method''', similar to but not exactly the same as the [[case method]], is the primary method of teaching [[law]] in [[Law school in the United States|law schools in the United States]].  It was pioneered at [[Harvard Law School]] by [[Christopher C. Langdell]].  It is based on the principle that rather than studying highly abstract summaries of legal rules (the technique used in most countries), the best way to learn [[Law of the United States|American law]] is to read the actual judicial [[opinion]]s which become the law under the rule of ''[[stare decisis]]'' (due to its Anglo-American [[common law]] origin).

==History and technique==
To set up the case method of law study, American law [[professor]]s traditionally collect the most illustrative cases concerning a particular area of the law in special textbooks called [[casebook]]s.  Some professors heavily edit cases down to the most important paragraphs, while deleting nearly all citations and paraphrasing everything else; a few present all cases in full, and most others are in between.  One common technique is to provide almost all of the entire text of a landmark case which created an important legal rule, followed by brief notes summarizing the holdings of other cases which further refined the rule.  
  
Traditionally, the casebook method is coupled with the [[Socratic method]] in American law schools.  For a given class, a professor will assign several cases from the casebook to read, and may also require students to be familiar with any notes following those cases.  In class, the professor will ask students questions about the assigned cases to determine whether they identified and understood the correct rule from the case, if there is one—in certain heavily contested areas of the law, there will ''not'' be any ''one'' correct rule.

A typical example in the law of contracts is ''[[Hadley v Baxendale]]'' (1854), a case that is still routinely tested on bar examinations today.  Treatises designed for practicing lawyers as well as textbooks for students earning non-legal degrees (i.e., business law courses for business administration students) concisely state the famous rules announced in that case that (1) consequential damages are limited to those foreseen by the parties at the time of contracting, thus implying that (2) a party must notify the other up front of its specific needs in order to expand what is mutually foreseeable and thereby recover consequential damages if the other breaches.  Thus stated, ''Hadley'' seems simple enough, but a casebook for a law school course will ''never'' say that.  Rather, the law student must deduce those principles from the somewhat archaic text of the Court of Exchequer's mid-19th-century decision.

This teaching method differs in two ways from the teaching methods used in most other academic programs: (1) it requires students to work almost exclusively with primary source material, which can be written in obscure or obsolete language for older cases; and (2) a typical American law school class is supposed to be a dialogue about the meaning of a case, not a straightforward lecture.

In some law schools, the casebook method is used in conjunction with lectures or other more structured forms of instruction.  This is especially true in classes which are more heavily geared toward [[statutory law]], such as [[tax law]] (which in the USA is governed by the [[Internal Revenue Code]]) and certain areas of [[commercial law]] (particularly courses dealing with the [[Uniform Commercial Code]]).

This method is also used in other [[common law]] countries, including [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].

===Law school outlines===
To facilitate the case method of study, "law school outlines" are used as legal topic [[study aid]]s. Typically, the outlines are created by [[law school]] students; however, there are professional outlines also available.  An outline typically provides a concise and direct statement of legal issues in a particular area of [[law]], organized according to the typical law school [[curriculum]]. In some cases, outlines are organized according to specific professors or courses. Outlines often remove many legal nuances and fact specific distinctions in [[case law]] to establish more generalized legal principles.  Students must remember to be cautious before relying on outlines written by others found on online databases.  They frequently come with copyright notices and may often be outdated.  Many such sites also warn their users that relying on these outlines alone will not be sufficient to prepare for an exam and they should only be used as a supplement to the studying process.

In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is, a common law court looks to past [[precedent]]ial decisions of relevant courts, and synthesizes the principles of those past cases as applicable to the current facts.  If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision (a principle known as ''[[stare decisis]]''). If, however, the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases (called a "[[Case of first impression|matter of first impression]]"), and legislative statutes are either silent or ambiguous on the question, judges have the authority and duty to resolve the issue (one party or the other has to win, and on disagreements of law, judges make that decision).&lt;ref&gt;''Marbury v.

== Definitions ==
The term ''common law'' has many connotations. The first three set out here are the most-common usages within the legal community. Other connotations from past centuries are sometimes seen, and are sometimes heard in everyday speech.

=== Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law {{Anchor|Disambiguate_statute}} ===
The first definition of "common law" given in ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'', 10th edition, 2014, is "The body of law derived from judicial decisions, rather than from statutes or constitutions; [synonym] CASELAW, [contrast] STATUTORY LAW."  &lt;ref name="Blacks10thDef1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Black's Law Dictionary – Common law|date=2014|edition=10th|p=334|quote=1. The body of law derived from judicial decisions, rather than from statutes or constitutions; [synonym] CASE LAW [contrast to] STATUTORY LAW.}}  ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' is the most-used legal dictionary used among legal professionals in the U.S.{{cite web|url=https://library.law.yale.edu/us-legal-dictionaries|title=U.S. Legal Dictionaries|last=|first=|date=|website=library.law.yale.edu|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This usage is given as the first definition in modern legal dictionaries, is characterized as the “most common” usage among legal professionals, and is the usage frequently seen in decisions of courts.&lt;ref name="GarnerUsageDef0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DuhaimeDef1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WashingtonProbateDef1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USvTexas"&gt;For an example of this usage in a decision of the United States Supreme Court, see the quote from ''United States v Texas'' in the section “[[Common law#Interaction with statute|Interaction of constitutional, statutory and common law]]” below.&lt;/ref&gt; In this connotation, "common law" distinguishes the authority that promulgated a law. For example, the law in most [[Anglo-America]]n [[jurisdiction]]s includes "[[statute|statutory law]]" enacted by a [[legislature]], "[[Regulation (law)|regulatory law]]" (in the U.S.) or “[[Primary and secondary legislation|delegated legislation]]” (in the U.K.) promulgated by [[executive branch]] agencies pursuant to delegation of rule-making authority from the legislature, and common law or "[[case law]]", ''i.e.'', decisions issued by [[courts]] (or [[quasi-judicial]] [[tribunal]]s within agencies).&lt;ref name="salmond32"&gt;{{harvnb|Salmond|1907|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|first connotation]] can be further differentiated into
; (a) pure common law: arising from the traditional and inherent authority of courts to define what the law is, even in the absence of an underlying statute or regulation. Examples include most [[criminal law]] and [[procedural law]] before the 20th century, and even today, most [[contract law]]&lt;ref&gt;E. Allen Farnsworth, Farnsworth on Contracts, §&amp;nbsp;1.7, Aspen (2004) (although certain fields of contract law have been modified by statute, "judicial decisions [remain] the dominant primary source of contract law.")&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[law of torts]].&lt;ref name="SpeiserLawOfTorts"&gt;Stuart Speiser, et al., The American Law of Torts, §§&amp;nbsp;1:2, 1:5, and 1:6, Thompson Reuters (2013) (describing common law development of tort law in England and the United States, and the "little reluctance [of courts] to overrule (or disapprove statements in) decisions in tort law either now deemed wrong or inadvisedly considered" and disinclination toward any contention that change must be by legislation).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GeneralCommonLaw_w_NoStatute"&gt;''E.g.'', Hadley v Baxendale (1854) 9 Exch 341 (defining a new rule of contract law with no basis in statute); ''Marbury v. Madison'', 137 5 U.S. 137 (1803) ("It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.");''MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.'', 217 N.Y. 382, 111 N.E. 1050 (N.Y. 1916) (discussed [[common law#CL Common Law Evolves|elsewhere in this article]], adjudicating the tort of negligence that existed in no statute, and expanding the law to cover parties that had never been addressed by statute);  Alexander Hamilton, ''[[The Federalist]]'', Nos. 78 and 81 (J. Cooke ed. 1961), 521–530, 541–55 ("The interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts. A constitution, is, in fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law. It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning, as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body."); see [[rule against perpetuities]] for a judicially created law originating in 1682 that governs the validity of trusts and [[future interests]] in [[real property]], [[Rule in Shelley's Case]] for a rule created by judges in 1366 or before, and [[life estate]] and [[fee simple]] for rules of real property ownership that were judicially created in the late 12th century as the crown began to give law-making power to courts.&lt;/ref&gt;
; (b) interstitial common law: court decisions that analyze, interpret and determine the fine boundaries and distinctions in law promulgated by other bodies. This body of common law, sometimes called "interstitial common law", includes judicial interpretation of the [[Constitution]], of legislative statutes, and of [[Regulation (law)|agency regulations]], and the application of law to specific facts.&lt;ref name="GarnerUsageDef0" /&gt;
Publication of decisions, and indexing, is essential to the development of common law, and thus governments and private publishers publish [[law reports]].&lt;ref&gt;In the United States, large legal publishers include West Publishing and Lexis. In the UK, examples of private reports are the [[All England Law Reports]] and the [[Lloyd's Law Reports]]&lt;/ref&gt; While all decisions in [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law jurisdictions]] are precedent (at varying levels and scope as discussed throughout the article on [[precedent]]), some become "leading cases" or "landmark decisions" that are cited especially often.

=== Common law legal systems as opposed to civil law legal systems {{Anchor|Disambiguate_civil_law}} ===
''Black's Law Dictionary'' 10th Ed., definition 2, differentiates "common law" jurisdictions and legal systems from "[[civil law (legal system)|civil law]]" or "[[Codification (law)|code]]" jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="Blacks10thDef2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GarnerUsageDef1"/&gt; Common law systems place great weight on court decisions, which are considered "law" with the same force of law as statutes—for nearly a millennium, common law courts have had the authority to make law where no legislative statute exists, and statutes mean what courts interpret them to mean.&lt;ref&gt;It is characteristic of the common law to adopt an approach based "on precedent, and on the development of the law incrementally and by analogy with established authorities".  ''Robinson v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police'', Supreme Court, [2018] UKSC 4, para.21.[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2018/4.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, in civil law jurisdictions (the legal tradition that prevails, or is combined with common law, in Europe and most non-Islamic, non-common law countries), courts lack authority to act if there is no statute.  Civil law judges tend to give less weight to judicial precedent, which means that a civil law judge deciding a given case has more freedom to interpret the text of a statute independently (compared to a common law judge in the same circumstances), and therefore less predictably. For example, the [[Napoleonic code]] expressly forbade French judges to pronounce general principles of law.&lt;ref&gt;"5. The judges are forbidden to pronounce, by way of general and legislative determination, on the causes submitted to them." [http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/code/book1/c_preliminary.html Code of Napoleon, Decree of March 5, 1803, Law 5]&lt;/ref&gt; The role of providing overarching principles, which in common law jurisdictions is provided in judicial opinions, in civil law jurisdictions is filled by giving greater weight to scholarly literature, as explained [[Common law#CL academic writings|below]].

Common law systems trace their history to England, while civil law systems trace their history through the [[Napoleonic Code]] back to the [[Corpus Juris Civilis]] of [[Roman law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radford.edu/~junnever/law/commonlaw.htm|title=Description and History of Common Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.berkeley.edu/library/robbins/CommonLawCivilLawTraditions.html|title=The Common Law and Civil Law Traditions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law as opposed to equity {{Anchor|3. Law as opposed to equity}} ===
''Black's Law Dictionary'' 10th Ed., definition 4, differentiates "common law" (or just "law") from "[[equity (law)|equity]]".&lt;ref name="Blacks10thDef4"&gt;{{cite book|title=Black's Law Dictionary – Common law|date=2014|edition=10th|p=334|quote=4. The body of law derived from law courts as opposed to those sitting in equity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="salmond32" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GarnerUsageDef2"&gt;{{cite book | title = A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage | last = Garner | first= Bryan A. | year = 2001 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = New York | edition = 2nd, revised | ref = harv|p=177|quote=Second, with the development of equity and equitable rights and remedies, ''common law'' and equitable courts, procedure, rights, and remedies, etc., are frequently contrasted, and in this sense ''common law'' is distinguished from ''equity.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1873, [[England and Wales|England]] had two complementary court systems: courts of "law" which could only award [[Monetary damages|money damages]] and recognized only the legal owner of property, and courts of "equity" ([[courts of chancery]]) that could issue [[injunction|injunctive relief]] (that is, a [[court order]] to a party to do something, give something to someone, or stop doing something) and recognized [[trust (law)|trusts]] of property. This split propagated to many of the colonies, including the United States. For most purposes, most jurisdictions, including the U.S. federal system and most states, have merged the two courts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule2.htm Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, Rule 2] ("There is one form of action—the civil action.") (1938)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="friedmanxix"&gt;{{harvnb|Friedman|2005|p=xix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, even before the separate courts were merged, most courts were permitted to apply both law and equity, though under potentially different procedural law. Nonetheless, the historical distinction between "law" and "equity" remains important today when the case involves issues such as the following:
* categorizing and prioritizing [[rights to property]]—for example, the same article of property often has a "[[Equitable title#Equitable versus legal title|legal title]]" and an "[[equitable title]]", and these two groups of ownership rights may be held by different people.
* in the United States, determining whether [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|the Seventh Amendment's]] right to a [[jury trial]] applies (a determination of a fact necessary to resolution of a "common law" claim)&lt;ref&gt;"In Suits at common law ... the right of [[Jury trial|trial by jury]] shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law."&lt;/ref&gt; vs. whether the issue will be decided by a [[judge]] (issues of what the law is, and all issues relating to equity).
* the standard of review and degree of deference given by an appellate tribunal to the decision of the lower tribunal under review (issues of law are reviewed ''de novo'', that is, "as if new" from scratch by the appellate tribunal, while most issues of equity are reviewed for "abuse of discretion", that is, with great deference to the tribunal below).
* the remedies available and rules of procedure to be applied.
Courts of equity rely on common law principles of binding precedent.

=== Archaic meanings and historical uses {{Anchor|4. Historical uses}} ===

In addition, there are several historical (but now archaic) uses of the term that, while no longer current, provide background context that assists in understanding the meaning of "common law" today.

In one usage that is now archaic, but that gives insight into the history of the common law, "common law" referred to the pre-Christian system of law, imported by the Saxons to England, and dating to before the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]], and before there was any consistent law to be applied.&lt;ref name="JeffersonToCooper"&gt;One example of this usage is in a letter from Thomas Jefferson to Dr. Thomas Cooper. {{cite web|last=Jefferson|first=Thomas|title=Letter to Dr. Thomas Cooper|url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/jefferson_cooper.html|accessdate=11 July 2012|date=February 10, 1814|quote=Authorities for what is common law may therefore be as well cited, as for any part of the Lex Scripta, and there is no better instance of the necessity of holding the judges and writers to a declaration of their authorities than the present; where we detect them endeavoring to make law where they found none, and to submit us at one stroke to a whole system, no particle of which has its foundation in the common law. For we know that the common law is that system of law which was introduced by the Saxons on their settlement in England, and altered from time to time by proper legislative authority from that time to the date of Magna Carta, which terminates the period of the common law, or lex non scripta, and commences that of the statute law, or Lex Scripta. This settlement took place about the middle of the fifth century. But Christianity was not introduced till the seventh century; the conversion of the first christian king of the Heptarchy having taken place about the year 598, and that of the last about 686. Here, then, was a space of two hundred years, during which the common law was in existence, and Christianity no part of it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JeffersonToCartwright&gt;Another example of this usage is in another letter of Jefferson, to John Cartright.{{cite web|last=Jefferson|first=Thomas|title=Letter To Major John Cartwright|url=http://www.yamaguchy.com/library/jefferson/cartwright.html|accessdate=11 July 2012|date=June 5, 1824|quote=I was glad to find in your book a formal contradiction, at length, of the judiciary usurpation of legislative powers; for such the judges have usurped in their repeated decisions, that Christianity is a part of the common law. The proof of the contrary, which you have adduced, is incontrovertible; to wit, that the common law existed while the Anglo-Saxons were yet Pagans, at a time when they had never yet heard the name of Christ pronounced, or knew that such a character had ever existed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; That usage is obsolete today. It is both underinclusive and overinclusive, as discussed [[Common law#CL Misconceptions|in the section on "misconceptions"]].

"Common law" as the term is used today in common law countries contrasts with ''[[ius commune]]''. While historically the ''ius commune'' became a secure point of reference in continental European legal systems, in England it was not a point of reference at all.&lt;ref name="Ius Commune' p.20"&gt;[[David John Ibbetson]], ''Common Law and Ius Commune'' p.20 (2001) {{ISBN|978-0-85423-165-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]] dealt with lawsuits in which the Monarch had no interest, i.e., between commoners.

''Black's Law Dictionary'' 10th Ed., definition 3 is "General law common to a country as a whole, as opposed to special law that has only local application."&lt;ref name="Blacks10th"&gt;{{cite book|title=Black's Law Dictionary – Common law|date=2014|edition=10th|p=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; From at least the 11th century and continuing for several centuries after that, there were several different circuits in the royal court system, served by [[Circuit court|itinerant judges]] who would travel from town to town dispensing the King's justice in "[[assize]]s". The term "common law" was used to describe the law held in common between the circuits and the different stops in each circuit.&lt;ref name="Blacks10th" /&gt; The more widely a particular law was recognized, the more weight it held, whereas purely local customs were generally subordinate to law recognized in a plurality of jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="Blacks10th" /&gt;

=== Misconceptions and imprecise nonlawyer usages{{anchor|CL_Misconceptions}} ===

A number of misconceptions of the term "common law" exist in popular culture and non-lawyer sources.
* Under the modern view, “common law” is not grounded in “custom” or "ancient usage", but rather acquires force of law instantly (without the delay implied by the term "custom" or "ancient") when pronounced by a higher court, because and to the extent the proposition is stated in judicial opinion.&lt;ref name="HolmesSouthernPacificBrooding" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CarpenterColumbiaCourtDecisions" /&gt; From the earliest times through the late 19th century, the dominant theory was that the common law was a pre-existent law or system of rules, a social standard of justice that existed in the habits, customs, and thoughts of the people. Under this older view, the legal profession considered it no part of a judge's duty to make new or change existing law, but only to expound and apply the old. By the early 20th century, largely at the urging of [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] (as discussed throughout this article), this view had fallen into the minority view: Holmes pointed out that the older view worked undesirable and unjust results, and hampered a proper development of the law. In the century since Holmes, the dominant understanding has been that common law “decisions are themselves law, or rather the rules which the courts lay down in making the decisions constitute law”.&lt;ref name="CarpenterColumbiaCourtDecisions" /&gt; The reality of the modern view can be seen in practical operation: under the old "pre-existing custom" view, (a) jurisdictions could not logically diverge from each other (but nonetheless did), (b) a new decision logically needed to operate retroactively (but did not), and (c) there was no standard to decide which English medieval customs should be "law" and which should not. All three tensions resolve under the modern view: (a) the common law in different jurisdictions may diverge, (b) new decisions need not have retroactive operation, and (c) court decisions are effective immediately as they are issued, not years later, or after they become "custom", and questions of what "custom" might have been at some "ancient" time are simply irrelevant.
* Common law, as the term is used among lawyers in the present day, is not frozen in time, and no longer beholden to 11th, 13th, or 17th century English law. Rather, the common law evolves daily and immediately as courts issue precedential decisions (as explained [[Common law#Principles Common Law Evolves|later in this article]]), and all parties in the legal system (courts, lawyers, and all others) are responsible for up-to-date knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''[[Abington School District v. Schempp]]'' ended prayer in public schools immediately, and same-sex marriage became legal throughout the United States immediately on the Supreme Court’s decision in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no fixed reference point (for example the 11th or 18th centuries) for the definition of "common law", except in a handful of isolated contexts.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution#The historical test|applicability of the Seventh Amendment]]&lt;/ref&gt; Much of what was "customary" in the 13th or 17th or 18th century has no part of the common law today; much of the common law today has no antecedent in those earlier centuries. Among legal professionals (lawyers and judges), the change in understanding occurred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (as explained [[Common law#History and Holmes|later in this article]]),&lt;ref name="CarpenterColumbiaCourtDecisions" /&gt; though lay dictionaries were decades behind in recognizing the change.
* The common law is not "unwritten". Common law exists in writing—as must any law that is to be applied consistently—in the written decisions of judges.&lt;ref name="GarnerUsageDef0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CarpenterColumbiaCourtDecisions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blacks10thDef1" /&gt;
* Common law is not the product of "universal consent". Rather, the common law is often anti-majoritarian.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', No. 10 and 78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bickel, Alexander M. "The Least Dangerous Branch." Yale University Press; 2d Ed. (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic principles of common law ==

=== Common law adjudication ===

In a common law jurisdiction several stages of research and analysis are required to determine "what the law is" in a given situation.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Kent Gionfriddo, Thinking Like a Lawyer: The Heuristics of Case Synthesis, 40 Texas Tech. L.Rev. 1 (Sep. 2007) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1012220] [https://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1209]&lt;/ref&gt; First, one must ascertain the facts. Then, one must locate any relevant statutes and cases. Then one must extract the principles, analogies and statements by various courts of what they consider important to determine how the next court is likely to rule on the facts of the present case. Later decisions, and decisions of higher courts or legislatures carry more weight than earlier cases and those of lower courts.&lt;ref&gt;''e.g.'', ''Ex parte Holt'', 19 USPQ2d 1211, 1214 (Bd. Patent App. &amp; Interf. 1991) (explaining the hierarchy of precedent binding on tribunals of the United States Patent Office)&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, one integrates all the lines drawn and reasons given, and determines "what the law is". Then, one applies that law to the facts.

In practice, common law systems are considerably more complicated than the simplified system described above. The decisions of a court are binding only in a particular [[jurisdiction]], and even within a given jurisdiction, some courts have more power than others. For example, in most jurisdictions, decisions by [[appellate courts]] are binding on lower courts in the same jurisdiction, and on future decisions of the same appellate court, but decisions of lower courts are only non-binding persuasive authority. Interactions between common law, [[constitutional law]], [[statutory law]] and [[Regulation (law)|regulatory law]] also give rise to considerable complexity.

=== The common law evolves to meet changing social needs and improved understanding {{anchor|CL_Common_Law_Evolves}} ===
[[File:Holmes Nomination.JPG|thumb|Nomination of Oliver Wendell Holmes to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, 1902.]]
[[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] cautioned that "the proper derivation of general principles in both common and constitutional law ... arise gradually, in the emergence of a consensus from a multitude of particularized prior decisions."&lt;ref&gt;Frederic R. Kellog, Law, Morals, and Justice Holmes, 69 Judicature 214 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Cardozo|Justice Cardozo]] noted the "common law does not work from pre-established truths of universal and inflexible validity to conclusions derived from them deductively", but "[i]ts method is inductive, and it draws its generalizations from particulars".&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin N. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 22–23 (1921).&lt;/ref&gt;

The common law is more malleable than statutory law. First, common law courts are not absolutely bound by precedent, but can (when extraordinarily good reason is shown) reinterpret and revise the law, without legislative intervention, to adapt to new trends in political, legal and [[social philosophy]]. Second, the common law evolves through a series of [[incrementalism|gradual steps]], that gradually works out all the details, so that over a decade or more, the law can change substantially but without a sharp break, thereby reducing disruptive effects.&lt;ref&gt;The beneficial qualities of the common law's incrementalist evolution was most eloquently expressed by the future [[Lord Mansfield]], then Solicitor General Murray, in the case of ''Omychund v. Barker'', who contended that "a statute very seldom can take in all cases; therefore the common law, that works itself pure by rules drawn from the fountain of justice, is for that reason superior to an [[Act of Parliament|act of parliament]]." I Atk. 21, 33, 26 Eng. Rep. 15, 22–23 (Ch. 1744)&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to common law incrementalism, the legislative process is very difficult to get started, as legislatures tend to delay action until a situation is totally intolerable. For these reasons, legislative changes tend to be large, jarring and disruptive (sometimes positively, sometimes negatively, and sometimes with unintended consequences).

One example of the gradual change that typifies evolution of the common law is the gradual change in liability for negligence. The traditional common law rule through most of the 19th century was that a plaintiff could not recover for a defendant's negligent production or distribution of a harmful instrumentality unless the two were in [[privity of contract]]. Thus, only the immediate purchaser could recover for a product defect, and if a part was built up out of parts from parts manufacturers, the ultimate buyer could not recover for injury caused by a defect in the part. In an 1842 English case, ''[[Winterbottom v. Wright]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Winterbottom v. Wright'', 10 M&amp;W 109, 152 Eng.Rep. 402, 1842 WL 5519 (Exchequer of pleas 1842)&lt;/ref&gt; the postal service had contracted with Wright to maintain its coaches. Winterbottom was a driver for the post. When the coach failed and injured Winterbottom, he sued Wright. The ''Winterbottom'' court recognized that there would be "absurd and outrageous consequences" if an injured person could sue any person peripherally involved, and knew it had to draw a line somewhere, a limit on the causal connection between the negligent conduct and the injury. The court looked to the contractual relationships, and held that liability would only flow as far as the person in immediate contract ("privity") with the negligent party.

A first exception to this rule arose in 1852, in the case of ''[[Thomas v. Winchester]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/archives/thomas_winchester.htm ''Thomas v. Winchester''], 6 N.Y. 397 (N.Y. 1852)&lt;/ref&gt; when New York's highest court held that mislabeling a poison as an innocuous herb, and then selling the mislabeled poison through a dealer who would be expected to resell it, put "human life in imminent danger". ''Thomas'' relied on this reason to create an exception to the "privity" rule. In, 1909, New York held in ''Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co.''&lt;ref&gt;''Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co.'', 195 N.Y. 478, 480 (N.Y. 1909)&lt;/ref&gt; that a coffee urn manufacturer was liable to a person injured when the urn exploded, because the urn "was of such a character inherently that, when applied to the purposes for which it was designed, it was liable to become a source of great danger to many people if not carefully and properly constructed".

Yet the privity rule survived. In ''Cadillac Motor Car Co. v. Johnson'',&lt;ref&gt;''Cadillac Motor Car Co. v. Johnson'', 221 F. 801 (2nd Cir. 1915)&lt;/ref&gt; (decided in 1915 by the federal appeals court for New York and several neighboring states), the court held that a car owner could not recover for injuries from a defective wheel, when the automobile owner had a contract only with the automobile dealer and not with the manufacturer, even though there was "no question that the wheel was made of dead and ‘dozy‘ wood, quite insufficient for its purposes." The ''Cadillac'' court was willing to acknowledge that the case law supported exceptions for "an article dangerous in its nature or likely to become so in the course of the ordinary usage to be contemplated by the vendor". However, held the ''Cadillac'' court, "one who manufactures articles dangerous only if defectively made, or installed, e.g., tables, chairs, pictures or mirrors hung on the walls, carriages, automobiles, and so on, is not liable to third parties for injuries caused by them, except in case of willful injury or fraud,"
[[File:Cardozo Nomination.JPG|thumb|Nomination of Benjamin Cardozo to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, 1932.]]
Finally, in the famous case of ''[[MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.'', 217 N.Y. 382, 111 N.E. 1050 (N.Y. 1916)[http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/archives/macpherson_buick.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1916, [[Benjamin Cardozo|Judge Benjamin Cardozo]] for New York's highest court pulled a broader principle out of these predecessor cases. The facts were almost identical to ''Cadillac'' a year earlier: a wheel from a wheel manufacturer was sold to Buick, to a dealer, to MacPherson, and the wheel failed, injuring MacPherson. Judge Cardozo held:

{{quote|It may be that Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co. have extended the rule of Thomas v. Winchester. If so, this court is committed to the extension. The defendant argues that things imminently dangerous to life are poisons, explosives, deadly weapons—things whose normal function it is to injure or destroy. But whatever the rule in Thomas v. Winchester may once have been, it has no longer that restricted meaning. A scaffold (Devlin v. Smith, supra) is not inherently a destructive instrument. It becomes destructive only if imperfectly constructed. A large coffee urn (Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co., supra) may have within itself, if negligently made, the potency of danger, yet no one thinks of it as an implement whose normal function is destruction. What is true of the coffee urn is equally true of bottles of aerated water (Torgesen v. Schultz, 192 N. Y. 156). We have mentioned only cases in this court. But the rule has received a like extension in our courts of intermediate appeal. In Burke v. Ireland (26 App. Div. 487), in an opinion by CULLEN, J., it was applied to a builder who constructed a defective building; in Kahner v. Otis Elevator Co. (96 App. Div. 169) to the manufacturer of an elevator; in Davies v. Pelham Hod Elevating Co. (65 Hun, 573; affirmed in this court without opinion, 146 N. Y. 363) to a contractor who furnished a defective rope with knowledge of the purpose for which the rope was to be used. We are not required at this time either to approve or to disapprove the application of the rule that was made in these cases. It is enough that they help to characterize the trend of judicial thought.

We hold, then, that the principle of ''Thomas v. Winchester'' is not limited to poisons, explosives, and things of like nature, to things which in their normal operation are implements of destruction. If the nature of a thing is such that it is reasonably certain to place life and limb in peril when negligently made, it is then a thing of danger. Its nature gives warning of the consequences to be expected. If to the element of danger there is added knowledge that the thing will be used by persons other than the purchaser, and used without new tests then, irrespective of contract, the manufacturer of this thing of danger is under a duty to make it carefully. ... There must be knowledge of a danger, not merely possible, but probable.}}

Cardozo's new "rule" exists in no prior case, but is inferrable as a synthesis of the "thing of danger" principle stated in them, merely extending it to "foreseeable danger" even if "the purposes for which it was designed" were not themselves "a source of great danger". ''MacPherson'' takes some care to present itself as foreseeable progression, not a wild departure. Cardozo continues to adhere to the original principle of ''[[Winterbottom v. Wright|Winterbottom]]'', that "absurd and outrageous consequences" must be avoided, and he does so by drawing a new line in the last sentence quoted above: "There must be knowledge of a danger, not merely possible, but probable." But while adhering to the underlying principle that ''some'' boundary is necessary, ''[[MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.|MacPherson]]'' overruled the prior common law by rendering the formerly dominant factor in the boundary, that is, the privity formality arising out of a contractual relationship between persons, totally irrelevant. Rather, the most important factor in the boundary would be the nature of the thing sold and the foreseeable uses that downstream purchasers would make of the thing.

The example of the evolution of the law of negligence in the preceding paragraphs illustrates two crucial principles: (a) The common law evolves, this evolution is in the hands of judges, and judges have "made law" for hundreds of years.&lt;ref name="SpeiserLawOfTorts" /&gt; (b) The [[ratio decidendi|reasons given for a decision]] are often more important in the long run than the outcome in a particular case. This is the reason that judicial opinions are usually quite long, and give rationales and policies that can be balanced with judgment in future cases, rather than the bright-line rules usually embodied in statutes.

=== Publication of decisions ===

All law systems rely on written publication of the law,&lt;ref name="BostonSocialLawCommonOrCivil" /&gt; so that it is accessible to all. Common law decisions are published in [[law reports]] for use by lawyers, courts and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=148|title=Legal Dictionary – Law.com|work=Law.com Legal Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the American Revolution, Massachusetts became the first state to establish an official Reporter of Decisions. As newer states needed law, they often looked first to the Massachusetts Reports for authoritative precedents as a basis for their own common law.&lt;ref name="BostonSocialLawCommonOrCivil"&gt;Social Law Library, Common Law or Civil Code?, Boston Mass.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States federal courts relied on private publishers until after the Civil War, and only began publishing as a government function [[United States Reports#history|in 1874]]. [[West (publisher)|West Publishing in Minnesota]] is the largest private-sector publisher of law reports in the United States. Government publishers typically issue only decisions "in the raw," while private sector publishers often add indexing, editorial analysis, and similar finding aids.

=== Interaction of constitutional, statutory and common law{{anchor|Interaction_with_statute}} ===

In common law legal systems, the common law is crucial to understanding almost all important areas of law. For example, in [[English law|England and Wales]], in English Canada, and in most states of the [[Law of the United States|United States]], the basic law of [[contract]]s, [[tort]]s and [[property law|property]] do not exist in statute, but only in common law (though there may be isolated modifications enacted by statute). As another example, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1877,&lt;ref&gt;''Meister v. Moore'', 96 U.S. 76 (1877) ("No doubt a statute may take away a common law right, but there is always a presumption that the legislature has no such intention unless it be plainly expressed.")&lt;/ref&gt; held that a [[Michigan]] statute that established rules for [[solemnization]] of marriages did not abolish pre-existing [[common-law marriage]], because the statute did not affirmatively require statutory solemnization and was silent as to preexisting common law.

In almost all areas of the law (even those where there is a statutory framework, such as contracts for the sale of goods,&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', [https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/ Uniform Commercial Code, Article 2, on Contracts for the Sales of Goods]&lt;/ref&gt; or the criminal law),&lt;ref&gt;[[Model Penal Code]] as adopted in several states, for example, [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/nycodes/c82.html New York's Penal Law]&lt;/ref&gt; legislature-enacted statutes generally give only terse statements of general principle, and the fine boundaries and definitions exist only in the [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|interstitial common law]]. To find out what the precise law is that applies to a particular set of facts, one has to locate [[precedent]]ial decisions on the topic, and reason from those decisions by [[analogy]].

In ([[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law jurisdictions (in the sense opposed to "civil law")]], legislatures operate under the assumption that [[statute]]s will be interpreted against the backdrop of the pre-existing common law. As the United States Supreme Court explained in ''United States v Texas'', 507 U.S. 529 (1993):

:Just as longstanding is the principle that "[s]tatutes which invade the common law ... are to be read with a presumption favoring the retention of long-established and familiar principles, except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident." ''Isbrandtsen Co. v. Johnson'', 343 U.S. 779, 783 (1952); ''Astoria Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. v. Solimino'', 501 U.S. 104, 108 (1991). In such cases, Congress does not write upon a clean slate. ''Astoria'', 501 U.S. at 108. In order to abrogate a common-law principle, the statute must "speak directly" to the question addressed by the common law. ''Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham'', 436 U. S. 618, 625 (1978); ''Milwaukee v. Illinois'', 451 U. S. 304, 315 (1981).

For example, in most U.S. states, the criminal statutes are primarily codification of pre-existing common law. ([[Codification (law)|Codification]] is the process of enacting a statute that collects and restates pre-existing law in a single document—when that pre-existing law is common law, the common law remains relevant to the interpretation of these statutes.) In reliance on this assumption, modern statutes often leave a number of terms and fine distinctions unstated—for example, a statute might be very brief, leaving the precise definition of terms unstated, under the assumption that these fine distinctions will be inherited from pre-existing common law. (For this reason, many modern American law schools teach the common law of crime as it stood in England in 1789, because that centuries-old English common law is a necessary foundation to interpreting modern criminal statutes.)

With the transition from English law, which had common law crimes, to the new legal system under the [[U.S. Constitution]], which prohibited [[ex post facto law|''ex post facto'' laws]] at both the federal and state level, the question was raised whether there could be common law crimes in the United States. It was settled in the case of [[United States v. Hudson and Goodwin|''United States v. Hudson'']],&lt;ref name="USvHudson"&gt;[[United States v. Hudson and Goodwin|''United States v. Hudson'']], {{ussc|11|32|1812}}&lt;/ref&gt; which decided that federal courts had no jurisdiction to define new common law crimes, and that there must always be a (constitutional) statute defining the offense and the penalty for it.

Still, many states retain selected common law crimes. For example, in Virginia, the definition of the conduct that constitutes the crime of robbery exists only in the common law, and the robbery statute only sets the punishment.&lt;ref&gt;''Johnson v. Commonwealth'', 209 Va. 291, 293, 163 S.E.2d 570, ___ (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Code of Virginia|Virginia Code]] section 1-200 establishes the continued existence and vitality of common law principles and provides that "The common law of England, insofar as it is not repugnant to the principles of the Bill of Rights and Constitution of this Commonwealth, shall continue in full force within the same, and be the rule of decision, except as altered by the General Assembly."

By contrast to statutory codification of common law, some statutes displace common law, for example to create a new [[cause of action]] that did not exist in the common law, or to legislatively overrule the common law. An example is the [[tort]] of [[wrongful death]], which allows certain persons, usually a spouse, child or [[estate (law)|estate]], to sue for damages on behalf of the deceased. There is no such tort in English common law; thus, any jurisdiction that lacks a wrongful death statute will not allow a lawsuit for the wrongful death of a loved one. Where a wrongful death statute exists, the compensation or other remedy available is limited to the remedy specified in the statute (typically, an upper limit on the amount of damages). Courts generally interpret statutes that create new causes of action narrowly—that is, limited to their precise terms—because the courts generally recognize the legislature as being supreme in deciding the reach of judge-made law unless such statute should violate some "second order" constitutional law provision (''cf''. [[judicial activism]]).

Where a tort is rooted in common law, all traditionally recognized damages for that tort may be sued for, whether or not there is mention of those [[damages]] in the current statutory law. For instance, a person who sustains bodily injury through the [[negligence]] of another may sue for medical costs, pain, suffering, loss of earnings or earning capacity, mental and/or emotional distress, loss of [[quality of life]], disfigurement and more. These damages need not be set forth in statute as they already exist in the tradition of common law. However, without a wrongful death statute, most of them are extinguished upon death.

In the United States, the power of the federal judiciary to review and invalidate unconstitutional acts of the federal executive branch is stated in the constitution, Article III sections 1 and 2: "The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. ... The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority..." The first [[List of landmark court decisions in the United States|landmark decision]] on "the judicial power" was ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', {{ussc|5|137|1803|Cranch|1}}. Later cases interpreted the "judicial power" of Article III to establish the power of federal courts to consider or overturn any action of Congress or of any state that conflicts with the Constitution.

The interactions between decisions of different courts is discussed further in the article on [[precedent]].

=== Overruling precedent—the limits of ''stare decisis'' ===
The [[Common law#United States federal system (1789 and 1938)|United States federal courts]] are divided into twelve regional circuits, each with a [[United States courts of appeals|circuit court of appeals]] (plus a thirteenth, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which hears appeals in patent cases and cases against the federal government, without geographic limitation). Decisions of one circuit court are binding on the district courts within the circuit and on the circuit court itself, but are only persuasive authority on sister circuits. District court decisions are not binding precedent at all, only persuasive.

Most of the U.S. federal courts of appeal have adopted a rule under which, in the event of any conflict in decisions of panels (most of the courts of appeal almost always sit in panels of three), the earlier panel decision is controlling, and a panel decision may only be overruled by the court of appeals sitting ''en banc'' (that is, all active judges of the court) or by a higher court.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', ''South Corp. v. United States'', 690 F.2d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1982) (''en banc'' in relevant part) (explaining order of precedent binding on the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit); ''Bonner v. City of Prichard, Alabama'', 661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir. 1981) (''en banc'') (after the Eleventh Circuit was split off from the Fifth Circuit, adopting precedent of Fifth Circuit as binding until overruled by the Eleventh Circuit ''en banc'': "The [pre-split] Fifth followed the absolute rule that a prior decision of the circuit (panel or ''en banc'') could not be overruled by a panel but only by the court sitting ''en banc''. The Eleventh Circuit decides in this case that it chooses, and will follow, this rule."); ''Ex parte Holt'', 19 USPQ2d 1211, 1214 (Bd. Patent App. &amp; Interf. 1991) (explaining the hierarchy of precedent binding on tribunals of the United States Patent Office).&lt;/ref&gt; In these courts, the older decision remains controlling when an issue comes up the third time.

Other courts, for example, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the Supreme Court, always sit ''en banc'', and thus the ''later'' decision controls. These courts essentially overrule all previous cases in each new case, and older cases survive only to the extent they do not conflict with newer cases. The interpretations of these courts—for example, Supreme Court interpretations of the constitution or federal statutes—are stable only so long as the older interpretation maintains the support of a majority of the court. Older decisions persist through some combination of belief that the old decision is right, and that it is not sufficiently wrong to be overruled.

In the jurisdictions of [[England and Wales]] and of [[Northern Ireland]], since 2009, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] has the authority to overrule and unify criminal law decisions of lower courts; it is the final court of appeal for civil law cases in all three of the UK jurisdictions but not for criminal law cases in Scotland. From 1966 to 2009, this [[judicial functions of the House of Lords|power]] lay with the [[House of Lords]], granted by the Practice Statement of 1966.&lt;ref&gt;83 Cr App R 191, 73 Cr App R 266&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada's federal system, described [[Common law#CL Canada federal|below]], avoids regional variability of federal law by giving national jurisdiction to both layers of appellate courts.

=== Common law as a foundation for commercial economies ===

The reliance on judicial opinion is a strength of common law systems, and is a significant contributor to the robust commercial systems in the United Kingdom and United States. Because there is reasonably precise guidance on almost every issue, parties (especially commercial parties) can predict whether a proposed course of action is likely to be lawful or unlawful, and have some assurance of consistency. As [[Justice Brandeis]] famously expressed it, "in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right."&lt;ref&gt;''Burnet v. Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.'', 285 U.S. 393, 406 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt; This ability to predict gives more freedom to come close to the boundaries of the law.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Yeo Tiong Min, "[http://www.singaporelaw.sg/content/SomeDifferences.html A Note on Some Differences in English Law, New York Law, and Singapore Law] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502093747/http://www.singaporelaw.sg/content/SomeDifferences.html |date=2007-05-02 }}" (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, many commercial contracts are more economically efficient, and create greater wealth, because the parties know ahead of time that the proposed arrangement, though perhaps close to the line, is almost certainly legal. Newspapers, taxpayer-funded entities with some religious affiliation, and political parties can obtain fairly clear guidance on the boundaries within which their [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] rights apply.

In contrast, in jurisdictions with very weak respect for precedent,&lt;ref&gt;for example, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]] issues very few of its decisions in precedential form, Kate Gaudry &amp; Thomas Franklin, Only 1 in 20,631 ex parte appeals designated precedential by PTAB, IPWatchdog (Sep. 27, 2015), and various lower tribunals in the Patent Office give very weak respect to earlier superior decisions.&lt;/ref&gt; fine [[Question of law|questions of law]] are redetermined anew each time they arise, making consistency and prediction more difficult, and procedures far more protracted than necessary because parties cannot rely on written statements of law as reliable guides. In jurisdictions that do not have a strong allegiance to a large body of precedent, parties have less ''a priori'' guidance (unless the written law is very clear and kept updated) and must often leave a bigger "safety margin" of unexploited opportunities, and final determinations are reached only after far larger expenditures on legal fees by the parties.

This is the reason&lt;ref name="EisenbergMillerNewYork" /&gt; for the frequent choice of the law of the State of New York in commercial contracts, even when neither entity has extensive contacts with New York—and remarkably often even when neither party has contacts with the United States.&lt;ref name="EisenbergMillerNewYork"&gt;Theodore Eisenberg &amp; Geoffrey P. Miller, The Flight to New York: An Empirical Study of Choice of Law and Choice of Forum Clauses in {{Sic|hide=y|Publicly|-}}Held Companies’ Contracts (2008). New York University Law and Economics Working Papers. Paper 124, http://lsr.nellco.org/nyu_lewp/124 (based on a survey of 2882 contracts, "New York law plays a role for major corporate contracts similar to the role Delaware law plays in the limited setting of corporate governance disputes. ... New York's dominance is striking. It is the choice of law in approximately 46 percent of contracts," and if merger contracts excluded, over half)&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial contracts almost always include a "choice of law clause" to reduce uncertainty. Somewhat surprisingly, contracts throughout the world (for example, contracts involving parties in Japan, France and Germany, and from most of the other states of the United States) often choose the law of New York, even where the relationship of the parties and transaction to New York is quite attenuated. Because of its history as the United States' commercial center, New York common law has a depth and predictability not (yet) available in any other jurisdictions of the United States. Similarly, American corporations are often formed under Delaware [[Corporations law|corporate law]], and American contracts relating to corporate law issues ([[Mergers and acquisitions|merger and acquisitions]] of companies, rights of shareholders, and so on.) include a Delaware [[choice of law]] clause, because of the deep body of law in Delaware on these issues.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg &amp; Miller at 19–20 (Delaware is chosen in about 15% of contracts, "Delaware dominates for one type of contract—[merger] trust agreements. ... The dominance of Delaware for this specialized type of contract is apparently due to the advantages and flexibility which Delaware's business trust statute.")&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some other jurisdictions have sufficiently developed bodies of law so that parties have no real motivation to choose the law of a foreign jurisdiction (for example, England and Wales, and the state of California), but not yet so fully developed that parties with no relationship to the jurisdiction choose that law.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg &amp; Miller at 19, only about 5% of commercial contracts designate California choice of law, where nearly 50% designate New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the United States, parties that are in different jurisdictions from each other often choose the law of England and Wales, particularly when the parties are each in former British colonies and members of the Commonwealth. The common theme in all cases is that commercial parties seek predictability and simplicity in their contractual relations, and frequently choose the law of a common law jurisdiction with a well-developed body of common law to achieve that result.

Likewise, for litigation of commercial disputes arising out of unpredictable torts (as opposed to the prospective choice of law clauses in contracts discussed in the previous paragraph), certain jurisdictions attract an unusually high fraction of cases, because of the predictability afforded by the depth of decided cases. For example, [[London]] is considered the pre-eminent centre for litigation of [[Admiralty law|admiralty]] cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/london-becomes-litigation-capital-of-the-world-1031231.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Richard | last=Osley | title=London becomes litigation capital of the world | date=2008-11-23}}. London is also forum for many defamation cases, because UK law is more plaintiff-friendly—in the United States, the First Amendment protection for freedom of the press allows for statements concerning public figures of questionable veracity, where in the UK, those same statements support a judgment for libel.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is not to say that common law is better in every situation. For example, civil law can be clearer than case law when the legislature has had the foresight and diligence to address the precise set of facts applicable to a particular situation. For that reason, civil law statutes tend to be somewhat more detailed than statutes written by common law legislatures—but, conversely, that tends to make the statute more difficult to read (the United States tax code is an example).&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Internal Revenue Service, Taxpayer Advocate Service, 2008 Report to Congress, https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/08_tas_arc_msp_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origins ===
The common law{{mdash}}so named because it was "common" to all the king's courts across England{{mdash}}originated in the practices of the courts of the English kings in the centuries following the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066.{{sfnp|Langbein|Lerner|Smith|2009|p=4}}  Prior to the Norman Conquest, much of England's legal business took place in the local folk courts of its various [[shires]] and [[Hundred (county division)|hundreds]].{{sfnp|Langbein|Lerner|Smith|2009|p=4}}  A variety of other individual courts also existed across the land: urban boroughs and merchant fairs held their own courts, as did the [[University of Oxford|universities of Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], and large landholders also held their own manorial and seigniorial courts as needed.{{sfnp|Langbein|Lerner|Smith|2009|p=4}}  Additionally, the [[Catholic Church]] operated its own court system that adjudicated issues of [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|canon law]].{{sfnp|Langbein|Lerner|Smith|2009|p=4}}

The main sources for the history of the common law in the Middle Ages are the [[plea rolls]] and the [[Year Books]]. The plea rolls, which were the official court records for the Courts of Common Pleas and King's Bench, were written in Latin. The rolls were made up in bundles by law term: Hilary, Easter, Trinity, and Michaelmas, or winter, spring, summer, and autumn. They are currently deposited in [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|the UK National Archives]], by whose permission images of the rolls for the Courts of Common Pleas, King's Bench, and Exchequer of Pleas, from the 13th century to the 17th, can be viewed online at the Anglo-American Legal Tradition site (The O'Quinn Law Library of the University of Houston Law Center).&lt;ref&gt;Documents from Medieval and Early Modern England from the National Archives in London.[http://aalt.law.uh.edu/]  Publications of the [[Selden Society]] include a Year Books series and other volumes transcribing and translating the original manuscripts of early common law cases and law reports, each volume having its editor's scholarly introduction.

The form of reasoning used in common law is known as [[casuistry]] or [[case-based reasoning]]. The common law, as applied in [[civil case]]s (as distinct from [[criminal case]]s), was devised as a means of [[damages|compensating]] someone for wrongful acts known as [[tort]]s, including both [[intentional tort]]s and torts caused by [[negligence]], and as developing the body of law recognizing and regulating [[contract]]s. The type of [[legal procedure|procedure]] practiced in common law courts is known as the [[adversarial system]]; this is also a development of the common law.

=== Medieval English common law ===

The early development of case-law in the thirteenth century has been traced to [[Henry de Bracton|Bracton's]] ''On the Laws and Customs of England'' and led to the yearly compilations of court cases known as [[Year Books]], of which the first extant was published in 1268, the same year that Bracton died.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodore Plucknett|T. F. T. Plucknett]], ''A Concise History of the Common Law, 5th edition, 1956, London and Boston, pp.260-261&lt;/ref&gt; The Year Books are known as the law reports of medieval England, and are a principal source for knowledge of the developing legal doctrines, concepts, and methods in the period from the 13th to the 16th centuries, when the common law developed into recognizable form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/law/faculty-scholarship/legal-history-the-year-books/ BUSL, ''Legal History: The Year Books'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge History of English and American Literature ''The Year Books and their Value''[http://www.bartleby.com/218/1309.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Westminster Hall edited.jpg|thumb|A view of [[Westminster Hall]] in the [[Palace of Westminster]], [[London]], early 19th century.]]

In 1154, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] became the first [[Plantagenet]] king. Among many achievements, Henry institutionalized common law by creating a unified system of law "common" to the country through incorporating and elevating local custom to the national, ending local control and peculiarities, eliminating arbitrary remedies and reinstating a [[jury]] system—citizens sworn on oath to investigate reliable criminal accusations and civil claims. The jury reached its [[verdict]] through evaluating common [[Traditional knowledge|local knowledge]], not necessarily through the presentation of [[evidence (law)|evidence]], a distinguishing factor from today's civil and criminal court systems.

Henry II developed the practice of sending judges from his own central court to hear the various disputes throughout the country. His judges would resolve disputes on an [[ad hoc]] basis according to what they interpreted the customs to be. The king's judges would then return to London and often discuss their cases and the decisions they made with the other judges. These decisions would be recorded and filed. In time, a rule, known as ''stare decisis'' (also commonly known as precedent) developed, whereby a judge would be bound to follow the decision of an earlier judge; he was required to adopt the earlier judge's interpretation of the law and apply the same principles promulgated by that earlier judge if the two cases had similar facts to one another. Once judges began to regard each other's decisions to be binding precedent, the pre-Norman system of local customs and law varying in each locality was replaced by a system that was (at least in theory, though not always in practice) common throughout the whole country, hence the name "common law".

Henry II's creation of a powerful and unified court system, which curbed somewhat the power of [[canon law|canonical]] (church) courts, brought him (and England) into conflict with the church, most famously with [[Thomas Becket]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. The murder of the Archbishop gave rise to a wave of popular outrage against the King. Henry was forced to repeal the disputed laws and to abandon his efforts to hold church members accountable for secular crimes (see also [[Constitutions of Clarendon]]).

The English [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]] was established after [[Magna Carta]] to try lawsuits between commoners in which the monarch had no interest. Its judges sat in open court in the Great Hall of the king's [[Palace of Westminster#Westminster Hall|Palace of Westminster]], permanently except in the vacations between the four terms of the [[Legal year]].

Judge-made common law operated as the primary source of law for several hundred years, before [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] acquired legislative powers to create [[statutory law]]. It is important to understand that common law is the older and more traditional source of law, and legislative power is simply a layer applied on top of the older common law foundation. Since the 12th century, courts have had parallel and co-equal authority to make law&lt;ref name="William Burnham 2006"&gt;William Burnham, ''Introduction to the Law and Legal System of the United States'', 4th ed. (St. Paul, Thomson West, 2006), 42.&lt;/ref&gt;—"legislating from the bench" is a traditional and essential function of courts, which was carried over into the U.S. system as an essential component of the "judicial power" specified by Article III of the U.S. Constitution.&lt;ref name="GeneralCommonLaw_w_NoStatute" /&gt; Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] summarized centuries of history in 1917, "judges do and must legislate."&lt;ref name="HolmesSouthernPacificLegislate"&gt;''Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen'', 244 U.S. 205, 221 (1917) (Holmes, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt; There are legitimate debates on how the powers of courts and legislatures should be balanced. However, the view that courts lack law-making power is historically inaccurate and constitutionally unsupportable.

In England, judges have devised a number of rules as to [[Mechanisms of the English common law|how to deal with precedent decisions]].

=== Influence of Roman law ===
The term "common law" is often used as a contrast to Roman-derived "civil law", and the fundamental processes and forms of reasoning in the two are quite different. Nonetheless, there has been considerable cross-fertilization of ideas, while the two traditions and sets of foundational principles remain distinct.

By the time of the rediscovery of the [[Roman law]] in Europe in the 12th and 13th centuries, the common law had already developed far enough to prevent a Roman law reception as it occurred on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., R. C. van Caenegem, ''The Birth of the English Common Law'' 89–92 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first common law scholars, most notably [[Ranulf de Glanvill|Glanvill]] and [[Henry de Bracton|Bracton]], as well as the early royal common law judges, had been well accustomed with Roman law. Often, they were clerics trained in the Roman canon law.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., [[Peter Birks]], Grant McLeod, ''Justinian's Institutes'' 7 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first and throughout its history one of the most significant treatises of the common law, Bracton's ''De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae'' (On the Laws and Customs of England), was heavily influenced by the division of the law in Justinian's ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis|Institutes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., George E. Woodbine (ed.), Samuel E. Thorne (transl.), ''Bracton on the Laws and Customs of England'', Vol. I (Introduction) 46 (1968); Carl Güterbock, ''Bracton and his Relation to the Roman Law'' 35–38 (1866).&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of Roman law had decreased sharply after the age of Bracton, but the Roman divisions of actions into ''[[in rem]]'' (typically, actions against a ''thing'' or property for the purpose of gaining title to that property; must be filed in a court where the property is located) and ''[[in personam]]'' (typically, actions directed against a person; these can affect a person's rights and, since a person often owns things, his property too) used by Bracton had a lasting effect and laid the groundwork for a return of Roman law structural concepts in the 18th and 19th centuries. Signs of this can be found in Blackstone's ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'',&lt;ref&gt;Stephen P. Buhofer, ''Structuring the Law: The Common Law and the Roman Institutional System'', Swiss Review of International and European Law (SZIER/RSDIE) 5/2007, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; and Roman law ideas regained importance with the revival of academic law schools in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Stein, ''Continental Influences on English Legal thought, 1600–1900'', ''in'' Peter Stein, ''The Character and Influence of the Roman Civil Law'' 223 ''et seq''. (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, today, the main systematic divisions of the law into property, contract, and tort (and to some extent [[unjust enrichment]]) can be found in the civil law as well as in the common law.&lt;ref&gt;See generally Stephen P. Buhofer, ''Structuring the Law: The Common Law and the Roman Institutional System'', Swiss Review of International and European Law (SZIER/RSDIE) 5/2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coke and Blackstone ===

The first attempt at a comprehensive compilation of centuries of common law was by Lord Chief Justice [[Edward Coke]], in his treatise, ''[[Institutes of the Lawes of England]]'' in the 17th century.

The next definitive historical treatise on the common law is ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', written by Sir [[William Blackstone]] and first published in 1765–1769.

=== Propagation of the common law to the colonies and Commonwealth by reception statutes ===

{{anchor|CL_Reception_Statutes}}A [[reception statute]] is a statutory law adopted as a former British colony becomes independent, by which the new nation adopts (i.e. receives) pre-independence common law, to the extent not explicitly rejected by the [[legislative body]] or [[constitution]] of the new nation. Reception statutes generally consider the English common law dating prior to independence, and the precedent originating from it, as the default law, because of the importance of using an extensive and predictable body of law to govern the conduct of citizens and businesses in a new state. All U.S. states, with the partial exception of [[Common law#Louisiana (1700s)|Louisiana]], have either implemented reception statutes or adopted the common law by judicial opinion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wl3KFBnC0P0C Thinking like a lawyer: an introduction to legal reasoning] (Westview Press, 1996), pg. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of reception statutes in the United States, the states of the U.S., Canada and its provinces, and Hong Kong, are discussed in the [[reception statute]] article.

Yet, adoption of the common law in the newly-independent nation was not a foregone conclusion, and was controversial. Immediately after the American Revolution, there was widespread distrust and hostility to anything British, and the common law was no exception.&lt;ref name=BostonSocialLawCommonOrCivil /&gt; Jeffersonians decried lawyers and their common law tradition as threats to the new republic. The Jeffersonians preferred a legislatively-enacted civil law under the control of the political process, rather than the common law developed by judges that—by design—were insulated from the political process. The Federalists believed that the common law was the birthright of Independence: after all, the natural rights to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" were the rights protected by common law. Even advocates for the common law approach noted that it was not an ideal fit for the newly-independent colonies: judges and lawyers alike were severely hindered by a lack of printed legal materials. Before Independence, the most comprehensive law libraries had been maintained by Tory lawyers, and those libraries vanished with the loyalist expatriation, and the ability to print books was limited. Lawyer (later president) John Adams complained that he "suffered very much for the want of books". To bootstrap this most basic need of a common law system—knowable, written law—in 1803, lawyers in Massachusetts donated their books to found a law library.&lt;ref name=BostonSocialLawCommonOrCivil /&gt;  A Jeffersonian newspaper criticized the library, as it would carry forward "all the old authorities practiced in England for centuries back ... whereby a new system of jurisprudence [will be founded] on the high monarchical system [to] become the Common Law of this Commonwealth... [The library] may hereafter have a very unsocial purpose."&lt;ref name=BostonSocialLawCommonOrCivil /&gt;

=== Decline of Latin maxims and "blind imitation of the past", and adding flexibility to ''stare decisis'' {{Anchor|History_and_Holmes}} ===
Well into the 19th century, ancient maxims played a large role in common law adjudication. Many of these maxims had originated in Roman Law, migrated to England before the introduction of Christianity to the British Isles, and were typically stated in Latin even in English decisions. Many examples are familiar in everyday speech even today, "[[Nemo iudex in causa sua|One cannot be a judge in one's own cause]]" (see [[Dr. Bonham's Case]]), rights are reciprocal to obligations, and the like. Judicial decisions and treatises of the 17th and 18th centuries, such at those of Lord Chief Justice [[Edward Coke]], presented the common law as a collection of such maxims.

Reliance on old maxims and rigid adherence to precedent, no matter how old or ill-considered, came under critical discussion in the late 19th century, starting in the United States. [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] in his famous article, "The Path of the Law",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|volume=10 |journal=Harvard Law Review |pages=457, 469 |year=1897|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2373|title=The Path of the Law|first=Oliver Wendell |last=Holmes, Jr.|doi=10.2307/1322028|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; commented, "It is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV. It is still more revolting if the grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule simply persists from blind imitation of the past." Justice Holmes noted that study of maxims might be sufficient for "the man of the present", but "the man of the future is the man of statistics and the master of economics". In an 1880 lecture at Harvard, he wrote:&lt;ref&gt;[[The Common Law (Holmes)|The Common Law]] [https://archive.org/details/commonlaw00holmuoft O. W. Holmes, Jr., ''The Common Law'']&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience. The felt necessities of the time, the prevalent moral and political theories, intuitions of public policy, avowed or unconscious, even the prejudices which judges share with their fellow men, have had a good deal more to do than the [[:w:syllogism|syllogism]] in determining the rules by which men should be governed. The law embodies the story of a nation's development through many centuries, and it cannot be dealt with as if it contained only the [[:w:axiom|axioms]] and corollaries of a book of mathematics.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the early 20th century, [[Louis Brandeis]], later appointed to the United States Supreme Court, became noted for his use of policy-driving facts and economics in [[Brandeis Brief|his briefs]], and extensive appendices presenting facts that lead a judge to the advocate's conclusion. By this time, briefs relied more on facts than on Latin maxims.

Reliance on old maxims is now deprecated.&lt;ref&gt;''Acree v. Republic of Iraq'', 370 F.3d 41 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (Roberts, J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt; Common law decisions today reflect both precedent and policy judgment drawn from economics, the social sciences, business, decisions of foreign courts, and the like. The degree to which these external factors ''should'' influence adjudication is the subject of active debate, but it is indisputable that judges ''do'' draw on experience and learning from everyday life, from other fields, and from other jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roper v. Simmons]], 543 U.S. 551 (2005) (holding unconstitutional to impose capital punishment for crimes committed while under the age of 18, based on "evolving standards of decency", largely based on other nations' law)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1870 through 20th century, and the procedural merger of law and equity ===
&lt;!-- "Fusion of law and equity" redirects here. Please edit redirect if changing the name of this section header --&gt;
As early as the 15th century, it became the practice that litigants who felt they had been cheated by the common law system would petition the King in person. For example, they might argue that an award of damages (at [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|common law (as opposed to equity)]]) was not sufficient redress for a trespasser occupying their land, and instead request that the trespasser be evicted. From this developed the system of [[Equity (law)|equity]], administered by the [[Lord Chancellor]], in the courts of [[Court of equity|chancery]]. By their nature, equity and law were frequently in conflict and litigation would frequently continue for years as one court countermanded the other,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Salmond|1907|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though it was established by the 17th century that equity should prevail.

In England, courts of law ([[Common law#Disambiguate equity|as opposed to equity]]) were combined with [[Court of equity|courts of equity]] by the [[Judicature Acts]] of 1873 and 1875, with equity prevailing in case of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Lobban, Michael "Preparing for Fusion: Reforming the Nineteenth-Century Court of Chancery, Part II | year=2004 | work=Law and History Review, 2004 (University of Illinois Press) . {{ISSN|0738-2480}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, parallel systems of [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|law]] (providing money [[damages]], with cases heard by a jury upon either party's request) and equity (fashioning a remedy to fit the situation, including injunctive relief, heard by a judge) survived well into the 20th century. The [[United States federal courts]] procedurally separated law and equity: the same judges could hear either kind of case, but a given case could only pursue causes in law or in equity, and the two kinds of cases proceeded under different procedural rules. This became problematic when a given case required both money damages and injunctive relief. In 1937, the new [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] combined [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|law]] and equity into one form of action, the "civil action". Fed.R.Civ.P. {{frcp|2}}. The distinction survives to the extent that issues that were "[[Common law#Disambiguate equity|common law (as opposed to equity)]]" as of 1791 (the date of adoption of the [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendment]]) are still subject to the right of either party to request a jury, and "equity" issues are decided by a judge.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', ''Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc.'', 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996) ("[W]e [the U.S. Supreme Court] have understood that the right of trial by jury thus preserved is the right which existed under the English [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|common law (as opposed to equity)]] when the Amendment was adopted. In keeping with our longstanding adherence to this 'historical test,', we ask, first, whether we are dealing with a cause of action that either was tried at [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|law (as opposed to equity)]] at the time of the founding or is at least analogous to one that was. If the action in question belongs in the law category, we then ask whether the particular trial decision must fall to the jury in order to preserve the substance of the common-law right as it existed in 1791." citations and quotations omitted, holding that interpretation of the scope of a patent had no analogy in 1790, and is thus a question to be decided by a judge, not a jury)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Delaware]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Tennessee]] still have separate courts of [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|law]] and equity, for example, the [[Delaware Court of Chancery|Court of Chancery]]. In many [[U.S. state|states]] there are separate divisions for law and equity within one court.

=== Common law pleading and its abolition in the early 20th century ===

For centuries, through the 19th century, the common law recognized only specific [[Form of action|forms of action]], and required very careful drafting of the opening pleading (called a [[writ]]) to slot into exactly one of them: Debt, Detinue, Covenant, Special Assumpsit, General Assumpsit, Trespass, Trover, Replevin, Case (or Trespass on the Case), and Ejectment.&lt;ref&gt;F. W. Maitland, ''The Forms of Action at Common Law'', 1909, Lecture I, online [https://legacy.fordham.edu/Halsall/basis/maitland-formsofaction.asp] or John Jay McKelvey, Principles of Common Law Pleading (1894) or [[James Barr Ames|Ames]], [[Joseph Chitty|Chitty]], [[Henry John Stephen|Stephen]], [[James Bradley Thayer|Thayer]] and other writers named in the preface of Perry's ''Common-law Pleading: its history and principles'' (Boston, 1897)[http://www.lawfulpath.com/ref/commonlawpleadin00perr.pdf] or [https://kateofgaia.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/handbook-of-common-law-pleadings1.pdf ''Handbook of Common Law Pleading, Koffler and Reppy, 1969, online'']&lt;/ref&gt; To initiate a lawsuit, a pleading had to be drafted to meet myriad technical requirements: correctly categorizing the case into the correct legal pigeonhole (pleading in the alternative was not permitted), and using specific "magic words" encrusted over the centuries. Under the old common law pleading standards, a suit by a ''pro se'' ("for oneself," without a lawyer) party was all but impossible, and there was often considerable procedural jousting at the outset of a case over minor wording issues.

One of the major reforms of the late 19th century and early 20th century was the abolition of common law pleading requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Note that the remainder of the "common law" discussed in the rest of the article remained intact; all that was abolished were the highly technical requirements for language of the paper provided by the plaintiff to the defendant to initiate a case.&lt;/ref&gt; A plaintiff can initiate a case by giving the defendant "a short and plain statement" of facts that constitute an alleged wrong.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, Rule 4, a complaint must contain "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief."&lt;/ref&gt; This reform moved the attention of courts from technical scrutiny of words to a more rational consideration of the facts, and opened access to justice far more broadly.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, Rule 1, civil procedure rules "should be construed, administered, and employed by the court and the parties to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternatives to common law systems ==

=== Civil law systems--comparisons and contrasts to common law{{anchor|Contrasts between common law and civil law systems}} ===
[[File:Corpus Iuris Civilis 02.jpg|thumb|A 16th century edition of ''Corpus Juris Civilis Romani'' (1583)]]

The main alternative to the common law system is the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system, which is used in [[Continental Europe]], and most of the rest of the world.

==== Judicial decisions play only a minor role in shaping civil law ====
The primary contrast between the two systems is the role of written decisions and precedent.

In common law jurisdictions, nearly every case that presents a ''bona fide'' disagreement on the law is resolved in a written opinion. The legal reasoning for the decision, known as ''[[ratio decidendi]]'', not only determines the court's judgment between the parties, but also stands as precedent for resolving future disputes. In contrast, civil law decisions typically do not include explanatory opinions, and thus no precedent flows from one decision to the next.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, H. Law, Liberty and the Constitution: A Brief History of the common Law (2018)&lt;/ref&gt;
In common law systems, a single decided case is binding [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|common law (connotation 1)]] to the same extent as statute or regulation, under the principle of ''stare decisis''. In contrast, in civil law systems, individual decisions have only advisory, not binding effect. In civil law systems, case law only acquires weight when a long series of cases use consistent reasoning, called ''[[jurisprudence constante]]''. Civil law lawyers consult case law to obtain their best prediction of how a court will rule, but comparatively, civil law judges are less bound to follow it.

For that reason, statutes in civil law systems are more comprehensive, detailed, and continuously updated, covering all matters capable of being brought before a court.&lt;ref&gt;''The Common Law and Civil Law Traditions'', Robbins Collection, University of California at Berkeley.[https://www.law.berkeley.edu/library/robbins/CommonLawCivilLawTraditions.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Adversarial system vs. inquisitorial system ====
[[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|Common law systems]] tend to give more weight to separation of powers between the judicial branch and the executive branch. In contrast, civil law systems are typically more tolerant of allowing individual officials to exercise both powers.  One example of this contrast is the difference between the two systems in allocation of responsibility between prosecutor and adjudicator.&lt;ref name="LawteacherInquisitorialAdversarial"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lawteacher.net/free-law-essays/constitutional-law/inquisitorial-and-adversarial-system-of-law-constitutional-law-essay.php|title=Inquisitorial And Adversarial System Of Law|website=lawteacher.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PortsmouthAdversarialInquisitory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://compass.port.ac.uk/UoP/file/c7ffec37-0632-475f-84ba-ae018a2f0f38/1/Types_of_law_IMSLRN.zip/page_10.htm|title=Types of Legal System: Adversarial v. Investigatory Trial Systems|first=|last=LangstoT|website=compass.port.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common law courts usually use an [[adversarial system]], in which two sides present their cases to a neutral judge.&lt;ref name="LawteacherInquisitorialAdversarial" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PortsmouthAdversarialInquisitory" /&gt; In contrast, in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems, criminal proceedings proceed under an [[inquisitorial system]] in which an examining magistrate serves two roles by developing the evidence and arguments for one side and then the other during the investigation phase.&lt;ref name="LawteacherInquisitorialAdversarial" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PortsmouthAdversarialInquisitory" /&gt;

The examining magistrate then presents the dossier detailing his or her findings to the president of the bench that will adjudicate on the case where it has been decided that a trial shall be conducted. Therefore, the president of the bench's view of the case is not neutral and may be biased while conducting the trial after the reading of the dossier. Unlike the common law proceedings, the president of the bench in the inquisitorial system is not merely an umpire and is entitled to directly interview the witnesses or express comments during the trial, as long as he or she does not express his or her view on the guilt of the accused.

The proceeding in the inquisitorial system is essentially by writing. Most of the witnesses would have given evidence in the investigation phase and such evidence will be contained in the dossier under the form of police reports. In the same way, the accused would have already put his or her case at the investigation phase but he or she will be free to change her or his evidence at trial. Whether the accused pleads guilty or not, a trial will be conducted. Unlike the adversarial system, the conviction and sentence to be served (if any) will be released by the trial jury together with the president of the trial bench, following their common deliberation.

There are many exceptions in both directions. For example, most proceedings before U.S. federal and state agencies are inquisitorial in nature, at least the initial stages (''e.g.'', a patent examiner, a social security hearing officer, and so on), even though the law to be applied is developed through common law processes.

==== Contrasting role of treatises and academic writings in common law and civil law systems{{anchor|CL academic writings}} ====
The role of the legal academy presents a significant "cultural" difference between common law ([[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|connotation 2]]) and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions.  In both systems, treatises compile decisions and state overarching principles that (in the author's opinion) explain the results of the cases.  In neither system are treatises considered "law," but the weight given them is nonetheless quite different.

In common law jurisdictions, lawyers and judges tend to use these treatises as only "finding aids" to locate the relevant cases. In common law jurisdictions, scholarly work is seldom cited as authority for what the law is.&lt;ref&gt;At least in the U.S., practicing lawyers tend to use "law professor" or "law review article" as a pejorative to describe a person or work that is insufficiently grounded in reality or practicality—every young lawyer is admonished repeatedly by senior lawyers not to write "law review articles," but instead to focus on the facts of the case and the practical effects of a given outcome.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chief Justice Roberts noted the "great disconnect between the academy and the profession."&lt;ref&gt;A Conversation with Chief Justice Roberts, June 11, 2011 [https://www.c-span.org/video/?300203-1/conversation-chief-justice-roberts] at 30:30.&lt;/ref&gt; When common law courts rely on scholarly work, it is almost always only for factual findings, policy justification, or the [[Legal history|history and evolution of the law]], but the court's legal conclusion is reached through analysis of relevant statutes and common law, seldom scholarly commentary.

In contrast, in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, courts give the writings of [[law school|law professors]] significant weight, partly because civil law decisions traditionally were very brief, sometimes no more than a paragraph stating who wins and who loses. The rationale had to come from somewhere else: the academy often filled that role.

==== Narrowing of differences between common law and civil law ====
The contrast between civil law and common law legal systems has become increasingly blurred, with the growing importance of [[jurisprudence]] (similar to [[case law]] but not binding) in civil law countries, and the growing importance of statute law and codes in common law countries.

Examples of common law being replaced by statute or codified rule in the United States include [[Common law offence#United States|criminal law]] (since 1812,&lt;ref name="USvHudson" /&gt; U.S. federal courts and most but not all of the States have held that criminal law must be embodied in statute if the public is to have fair notice), [[commercial law]] (the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] in the early 1960s) and procedure (the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] in the 1930s and the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] in the 1970s). But note that in each case, the statute sets the general principles, but the [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|interstitial common law]] process determines the scope and application of the statute.

An example of convergence from the other direction is shown in the 1982 decision ''Srl CILFIT and Lanificio di Gavardo SpA v Ministry of Health'' ({{ECLI|ECLI:EU:C:1982:335}}), in which the [[European Court of Justice]] held that questions it has already answered need not be resubmitted. This showed how a historically distinctly common law principle is used by a court composed of judges (at that time) of essentially civil law jurisdiction.

and many other generally [[English-speaking countries]] or [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries (except the UK's [[Common law#CL Scotland|Scotland]], which is [[bijuridicial law|bijuridicial]], and [[Malta]]). Essentially, every country that was colonised at some time by England, Great Britain, or the United Kingdom uses common law except those that were formerly colonised by other nations, such as [[Law of Quebec|Quebec]] (which follows the [[bijuridicial law|law]] of France in part), South Africa and Sri Lanka (which follow [[Common law#CL Roman Dutch|Roman Dutch law]]), where the prior civil law system was retained to respect the [[civil rights]] of the local colonists. Guyana and Saint Lucia have mixed Common Law and Civil Law systems.

The remainder of this section discusses jurisdiction-specific variants, arranged chronologically.

=== Scotland{{anchor|CL Scotland}} ===
[[Scotland]] is often said to use the civil law system, but it has [[Scots law|a unique system]] that combines elements of an uncodified civil law dating back to the [[Corpus Juris Civilis]] with an element of its own common law long predating the [[Act of Union (1707)|Treaty of Union]] with England in 1707 (see [[Legal institutions of Scotland in the High Middle Ages]]), founded on the customary laws of the tribes residing there. Historically, [[Scots Law|Scottish common law]] differed in that the use of ''precedent'' was subject to the courts' seeking to discover the principle that justifies a law rather than searching for an example as a ''precedent'',&lt;ref&gt;Stair Memorial Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; and principles of [[natural justice]] and fairness have always played a role in Scots Law. From the 19th century, the Scottish approach to precedent developed into a ''stare decisis'' akin to that already established in England thereby reflecting a narrower, more modern approach to the application of case law in subsequent instances. This is not to say that the substantive rules of the common laws of both countries are the same although in many matters (particularly those of UK-wide interest) they are similar.

Scotland shares the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]], with England, Wales and Northern Ireland for civil cases; the court's decisions are binding on the jurisdiction from which a case arises but only influential on similar cases arising in Scotland. This has had the effect of converging the law in certain areas. For instance, the modern UK [[negligence|law of negligence]] is based on ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'', a case originating in Paisley, Scotland.

Scotland maintains a separate criminal law system from the rest of the UK, with the [[High Court of Justiciary]] being the final court for criminal appeals. The highest court of appeal in civil cases brought in Scotland is now the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] (before October 2009, final appellate jurisdiction lay with the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/about/role-of-the-supreme-court.html|title=Role of The Supreme Court – The Supreme Court|first=The Supreme|last=Court|website=www.supremecourt.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
==== States of the United States (17th century on){{anchor|CL United States}} ====
The centuries-old authority of the common law courts in England to develop law case by case and to apply statute law&lt;ref name="William Burnham 2006" /&gt;—"legislating from the bench"— is a traditional function of courts, which was carried over into the U.S. system as an essential component of the "judicial power" specified by Article III of the U.S. constitution.&lt;ref name="GeneralCommonLaw_w_NoStatute" /&gt; Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] summarized centuries of history in 1917, "judges do and must legislate” (in the federal courts, only interstitially, in state courts, to the full limits of common law adjudicatory authority).&lt;ref name="HolmesSouthernPacificLegislate" /&gt;

===== New York (17th century) =====
The state of [[New York (state)|New York]], which also has a civil law history from its [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch colonial]] days, began a [[Codification (law)|codification]] of its law in the 19th century. The only part of this codification process that was considered complete is known as the [[Field Code]] applying to [[civil procedure]]. The original colony of [[New Netherland]] was settled by the Dutch and the law was also Dutch. When the English captured pre-existing colonies they continued to allow the local settlers to keep their civil law. However, the Dutch settlers revolted against the English and the colony was [[Second Anglo-Dutch War|recaptured]] by the Dutch. When the English finally regained control of New Netherland they forced, as a punishment unique in the history of the British Empire, the English imposed common law upon all the colonists, including the Dutch. This was problematic, as the [[patroon]] system of land holding, based on the [[Feudalism|feudal system]] and civil law, continued to operate in the colony until it was abolished in the mid-19th century. The influence of [[Roman-Dutch law]] continued in the colony well into the late 19th century. The codification of a law of general obligations shows how remnants of the civil law tradition in New York continued on from the Dutch days.

===== Louisiana (1700s){{anchor|Louisiana (1700s)}} =====

Under [[Law of Louisiana|Louisiana's codified system]], the [[Louisiana Civil Code]], private law—that is, [[substantive law]] between private sector parties—is based on principles of law from continental Europe, with some common law influences. These principles derive ultimately from [[Roman law]], transmitted through [[Law of France|French law]] and [[Law of Spain|Spanish law]], as the state's current territory intersects the area of North America colonized by Spain and by France. Contrary to popular belief, the Louisiana code does not directly derive from the [[Napoleonic Code]], as the latter was enacted in 1804, one year after the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. However, the two codes are similar in many respects due to common roots.

Louisiana's [[criminal law]] largely rests on English common law. Louisiana's [[administrative law]] is generally similar to the [[administrative Procedure Act (United States)|administrative law of the U.S. federal government]] and other U.S. states. Louisiana's [[procedural law]] is generally in line with that of other U.S. states, which in turn is generally based on the U.S. [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]].

Historically notable among the Louisiana code's differences from common law is the role of property rights among women, particularly in inheritance gained by widows.

===== California (1850s) =====
The [[U.S. state]] of [[California]] has a system based on common law, but it has [[Codification (law)|codified]] the law in the manner of the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions. The reason for the enactment of the [[California Codes]] in the 19th century was to replace a pre-existing system based on Spanish civil law with a system based on common law, similar to that in most other states. California and a number of other [[Western United States|Western states]], however, have retained the concept of [[community property]] derived from civil law. The California courts have treated portions of the codes as an extension of the common-law tradition, subject to judicial development in the same manner as judge-made common law. (Most notably, in the case ''[[Li v. Yellow Cab Co.]]'', 13 Cal.3d 804 (1975), the [[California Supreme Court]] adopted the principle of [[comparative negligence]] in the face of a [[California Civil Code]] provision codifying the traditional common-law doctrine of [[contributory negligence]].)

==== United States federal courts (1789 and 1938){{anchor|CL United States federal}} ====
[[File:Uscatitle11.jpg|thumb|USCA: some annotated volumes of the [[United States Code|official compilation]] and codification of federal statutes.]]

The United States federal government (as opposed to the states) has a variant on a common law system. [[United States federal courts]] only act as interpreters of statutes and the constitution by elaborating and precisely defining broad statutory language ([[Common law#Disambiguate statute|connotation 1(b)]] above), but, unlike state courts, do not act as an independent source of common law.

Before 1938, the federal courts, like almost all other common law courts, decided the law on any issue where the relevant legislature (either the U.S. Congress or state legislature, depending on the issue), had not acted, by looking to courts in the same system, that is, other federal courts, even on issues of state law, and even where there was no express grant of authority from Congress or the Constitution.

In 1938, the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins]]'' [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=304&amp;page=64 304 U.S. 64, 78] (1938), overruled earlier precedent,&lt;ref&gt;''Swift v. Tyson'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=41&amp;page=1 41 U.S. 1] (1842). In ''Swift'', the [[United States Supreme Court]] had held that federal courts hearing cases brought under their [[diversity jurisdiction]] (allowing them to hear cases between parties from different states) had to apply the statutory law of the states, but not the common law developed by state courts. Instead, the Supreme Court permitted the federal courts to make their own common law based on general principles of law. ''Erie v. Tompkins'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=304&amp;page=64 304 U.S. 64] (1938). ''Erie'' overruled ''Swift v. Tyson'', and instead held that federal courts exercising diversity jurisdiction had to use all of the same [[substantive law]] as the courts of the states in which they were located. As the ''Erie'' Court put it, there is no "general federal common law", the key word here being '''''general'''''. This history is elaborated in
[[federal common law]].&lt;/ref&gt; and held "There is no federal general common law," thus confining the federal courts to act only as interpreters of law originating elsewhere. ''E.g.'', ''Texas Industries v. Radcliff'', {{ussc|451|630|1981}} (without an express grant of statutory authority, federal courts cannot create rules of intuitive justice, for example, a right to contribution from co-conspirators). Post-1938, federal courts deciding issues that arise under state law are required to defer to state court interpretations of state statutes, or reason what a state's highest court would rule if presented with the issue, or to certify the question to the state's highest court for resolution.

Later courts have limited ''Erie'' slightly, to create a few situations where [[United States federal courts]] are permitted to create [[federal common law]] rules without express statutory authority, for example, where a federal rule of decision is necessary to protect uniquely federal interests, such as foreign affairs, or financial instruments issued by the federal government. ''See, e.g.'', ''[[Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States]]'', {{ussc|318|363|1943}} (giving federal courts the authority to fashion common law rules with respect to issues of federal power, in this case [[negotiable instrument]]s backed by the federal government); ''see also'' ''[[International News Service v. Associated Press]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=248&amp;page=215 248 U.S. 215] (1918) (creating a cause of action for misappropriation of "hot news" that lacks any statutory grounding); ''but see National Basketball Association v. Motorola, Inc.'', 105 F.3d 841, 843–44, 853 (2d Cir. 1997) (noting continued vitality of ''INS'' "hot news" tort under New York state law, but leaving open the question of whether it survives under federal law). Except on Constitutional issues, Congress is free to legislatively overrule federal courts' common law.&lt;ref&gt;''City of Boerne v. Flores'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=521&amp;invol=507 521 U.S. 507] (1997) (invalidating the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]], in which Congress had attempted to redefine the court's jurisdiction to decide constitutional issues); ''Milwaukee v. Illinois'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=451&amp;invol=304 451 U.S. 304] (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== United States executive branch agencies (1946) ====
Most executive branch agencies in the United States federal government have some adjudicatory authority. To greater or lesser extent, agencies honor their own precedent to ensure consistent results. Agency decision making is governed by the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]] of 1946.

For example, the [[National Labor Relations Board]] issues relatively few [[regulations]], but instead promulgates most of its substantive rules through [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|common law (connotation 1)]].

=== India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh (19th century and 1948){{anchor|CL India and Pakistan}} ===
The law of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh are largely based on [[English law|English]] common law because of the long period of [[British Empire|British colonial influence]] during the period of the [[British India|British Raj]].

[[History of India|Ancient India]] represented a distinct tradition of law, and had an historically independent school of legal theory and practice. The ''[[Arthashastra]]'', dating from 400 BCE and the ''[[Manusmriti]]'', from 100 CE, were influential treatises in India, texts that were considered authoritative legal guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Glenn|2000|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]]'s central philosophy was tolerance and [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], and was cited across [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Glenn|2000|p=276}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in this period, which finally culminated in the creation of the [[Gupta Empire]], relations with ancient Greece and Rome were not infrequent. The appearance of similar fundamental institutions of international law in various parts of the world show that they are inherent in international society, irrespective of culture and tradition.{{sfn|Alexander|1952|pp=289–300}} Inter-State relations in the pre-Islamic period resulted in clear-cut rules of warfare of a high humanitarian standard, in rules of neutrality, of treaty law, of customary law embodied in religious charters, in exchange of embassies of a temporary or semi-permanent character.&lt;ref&gt;Viswanatha, S.T., ''International Law in Ancient India'', 1925&lt;/ref&gt;

When India became part of the [[British Empire]], there was a break in tradition, and Hindu and Islamic law were supplanted by the common law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Glenn|2000|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the failed [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|rebellion]] against the British in 1857, the [[British Parliament]] took over control of India from the [[British East India Company]], and [[British India]] came under the direct rule of [[the Crown]]. The British Parliament passed the [[Government of India Act 1858|Government of India Act of 1858]] to this effect, which set up the structure of British government in India.&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/393/ |title = Official, India |work = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1890–1923 |accessdate = 2013-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It established in Britain the office of the [[Secretary of State for India]] through whom the Parliament would exercise its rule, along with a [[Council of India]] to aid him. It also established the office of the [[Governor-General of India]] along with an Executive Council in India, which consisted of high officials of the British Government. As a result, the present judicial system of the country derives largely from the British system and has little correlation to the institutions of the pre-British era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jain|2006|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify-inline|date=August 2015}}

==== Post-partition India (1948){{anchor|CL India}} ====

[[File:Constitution of India.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Constitution of India]] is the longest written constitution for a country, containing 395 articles, 12 schedules, numerous amendments and 117,369 words.]]

Legislation first introduced by the British is still in effect in modified form today. During the drafting of the [[Indian Constitution]], laws from Ireland, the United States, Britain, and France were all synthesized to produce a refined set of Indian laws. Indian laws also adhere to the [[United Nations]] guidelines on [[human rights law]] and [[environmental law]]. Certain [[international trade law]]s, such as those on [[intellectual property]], are also enforced in India.

The exception to this rule is in the state of [[Goa]], annexed in stages in the 1960s through 1980s. In Goa, a Portuguese [[uniform civil code]] is in place, in which all religions have a common law regarding marriages, divorces and adoption.

==== Post-partition Pakistan (1948){{anchor|CL Pakistan}} ====

==== Post-partition Bangladesh (1968){{anchor|CL Bangladesh}} ====

Post-partition, Bangladesh retained its common law system.

=== Canada (1867){{anchor|CL Canada}} ===

[[Canadian law|Canada]] has separate federal and provincial legal systems. The division of [[jurisdiction]] between the federal and provincial Parliaments is specified in the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-5.html#anchorbo-ga:s_91-gb:s_91 Constitution Act, 1867], s. 91(10), (18)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Canadian provincial law{{anchor|CL Canada provinces}} ====

Each [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province and territory]] is considered a separate jurisdiction with respect to common law matters. As such, only the provincial legislature may enact legislation to amend private law. Each has its own procedural law, statutorily created provincial courts and superior trial courts with inherent jurisdiction culminating in the Court of Appeal of the province. This is the highest court in provincial jurisdiction, only subject to the Supreme Court of Canada in terms of appeal of their decisions. All but one of the provinces of [[Law of Canada|Canada]] use a common law system (the exception being [[Law of Quebec|Quebec]], which uses a French-heritage civil law system for issues arising within provincial jurisdiction, such as property ownership and contracts).

==== Canadian federal law{{anchor|CL Canada federal}} ====

Canadian Federal Courts operate under a separate system throughout Canada and deal with narrower subject matter than superior courts in provincial jurisdiction. They hear cases reserved for federal jurisdiction by the Canadian constitution, such as immigration, intellectual property, judicial review of federal government decisions, and admiralty. The [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]] is the appellate level court in federal jurisdiction and hears cases in multiple cities, and unlike the United States, the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal is not divided into appellate circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fca-caf.gc.ca/index_e.shtml |title=Federal Court of Appeal – Home |publisher=Fca-caf.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminal law is uniform throughout Canada. It is based on the constitution and federal statutory Criminal Code, as interpreted by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]. The administration of justice and enforcement of the criminal code are the responsibilities of the provinces.

Canadian federal statutes must use the terminology of both the common law and civil law for those matters; this is referred to as legislative bijuralism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canada.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/harmonization/bijurilex/aboutb-aproposb.html|title=Department of Justice – About Bijuralism|first=Government of Canada, Department of Justice, Legislative Services|last=Branch|website=canada.justice.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nicaragua ===
[[Nicaragua]]'s legal system is also a mixture of the English Common Law and Civil Law.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} This situation was brought through the influence of British administration of the Eastern half of the [[Mosquito Coast]] from the mid-17th century until about 1894, the [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]] period from about 1855 through 1857, USA interventions/occupations during the period from 1909 to 1933, the influence of USA institutions during the [[Somoza family]] administrations (1933 through 1979) and the considerable importation between 1979 and the present of USA culture and institutions.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

=== Israel (1948){{anchor|CL Israel}} ===
[[Israeli law|Israel]] has a common law legal system. Its basic principles are inherited from the law of the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate of Palestine]] and thus resemble those of British and American law, namely: the role of courts in creating the body of law and the authority of the [[Supreme Court of Israel|supreme court]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lawofisrael.com/israeli-supreme-court-decisions | title=Supreme court decisions database}}&lt;/ref&gt; in reviewing and if necessary overturning legislative and executive decisions, as well as employing the adversarial system. One of the primary reasons that the [[Constitution of Israel|Israeli constitution]] remains [[unwritten constitution|unwritten]] is the fear by whatever party holds power that creating a written constitution, combined with the common-law elements, would severely limit the powers of the [[Knesset]] (which, following the doctrine of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], holds near-unlimited power).{{sfn|Mahler|2004|p=126}}

=== Roman Dutch Common law{{anchor|CL Roman Dutch}} ===
[[Roman Dutch law|Roman Dutch Common law]] is a bijuridical or mixed system of law similar to the common law system in [[Scotland]] and [[Common law#Louisiana (1700s)|Louisiana]]. Roman Dutch common law jurisdictions include [[Law of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Botswana]], [[Lesotho]], [[Namibia]], [[Swaziland]], [[Sri-Lanka]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. Many of these jurisdictions recognise customary law, and in some, such as South Africa the Constitution requires that the common law be developed in accordance with the Bill of Rights. Roman Dutch common law is a development of [[Roman Dutch law]] by courts in the Roman Dutch common law jurisdictions. During the Napoleonic wars the Kingdom of the Netherlands adopted the French ''code civil'' in 1809, however the Dutch colonies in the Cape of Good Hope and Sri Lanka, at the time called Ceylon, were seized by the British to prevent them being used as bases by the French Navy. The system was developed by the courts and spread with the expansion of British colonies in Southern Africa. Roman Dutch common law relies on legal principles set out in Roman law sources such as Justinian's Institutes and Digest, and also on the writing of Dutch jurists of the 17th century such as [[Hugo Grotius|Grotius]] and [[Johannes Voet|Voet]]. In practice, the majority of decisions rely on recent precedent.

=== Ghana ===
Ghana follows the English common-law&lt;ref&gt;The common law as used in this paper designates the English common-law as a legal tradition which is made up of law (generally referred to as the common law), and the doctrine of equity.&lt;/ref&gt; tradition which was inherited from the British during her colonisation. Consequently, the laws of Ghana are, for the most part, a modified version of imported law that is continuously adapting to changing socio-economic and political realities of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Obiri-Korang P "Private international law of contract in Ghana: the need for a paradigm shift" (2017) P 8; Quansah ''The Ghana Legal System'' (2011) P 51&lt;/ref&gt; The Bond of 184&lt;ref&gt;The Bond was a pact between the British and some chiefs from the southern states of the Gold Coast under which British protection was extended to the signatories in exchange for judicial authority over them.&lt;/ref&gt; 4 was the first most important event in the history of Ghana (then Gold Coast) that marked the critical period when the people ceded their independence to the British&lt;ref&gt;See, generally, Benion ''The Constitutional Law of Ghana'' (1962). Boahen, however, submits that the Bond of 1844 is not as important as held by some Ghanaian historians. He further posits that it cannot be the Mgna Carta of Ghana or the basis for British rule or law – see Boahen ''Ghana: Evolution and Change in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Century'' (1975) 36.&lt;/ref&gt; and gave the British judicial authority. Later, the Supreme Court Ordinance of 1876 “formally” introduced British law, be it the common law or statutory law, in the Gold Coast.&lt;ref&gt;Asante “Over a hundred years of a national legal system in Ghana: a review and critique” 1988 ''Journal of African Law'' 31 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Section 14&lt;ref&gt;This states that “the common law, the doctrines of equity, and Statutes of general application which were in force in England at the date when the colony obtained a local legislature, that is to say, on the 24th of July 1874, shall be in force within the jurisdiction of the court”.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Ordinance formalised the application of the common-law tradition in the country.

Ghana, after independence, did not do away with the common law system inherited from the British, and today it has been enshrined in the 1992 Constitution of the country. Chapter four of Ghana's Constitution, entitled “The Laws of Ghana”, has in Article 11(1) the list of laws applicable in the state. This comprises (a) the Constitution; (b) enactments made by or under the authority of the Parliament established by the Constitution; (c) any Orders, Rules and Regulations made by any person or authority under a power conferred by the Constitution; (d) the existing law; and (e) the common law.&lt;ref&gt;According to Article 11(2) of Ghana’s Constitution, the common law of Ghana shall comprise the rule of law generally known as the common law, the rules generally known as the doctrine of equity and the rules of customary law, including those determined by the Superior Court of Judicature.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the modern-day Constitution of Ghana, like those before it, embraced the English common law by entrenching it in its provisions. The doctrine of judicial precedence which is based on the principle of ''stare decisis'' as applied in England and other pure common law countries also applies in Ghana.

[[File:WilliamBlackstone.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sir William Blackstone]] as illustrated in his ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]''.]]
[[Edward Coke]], a 17th-century Lord Chief Justice of the English Court of Common Pleas and a [[Member of Parliament]], wrote several legal texts that collected and integrated centuries of case law. Lawyers in both England and America learned the law from his ''[[Institutes of the Lawes of England|Institutes]]'' and ''Reports'' until the end of the 18th century. His works are still cited by common law courts around the world.

The next definitive historical treatise on the common law is ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', written by Sir [[William Blackstone]] and first published in 1765–1769. Since 1979, a facsimile edition of that first edition has been available in four paper-bound volumes. Today it has been superseded in the English part of the United Kingdom by [[Halsbury's Laws of England]] that covers both common and statutory English law.

While he was still on the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]], and before being named to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]], Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] published a short volume called ''[[The Common Law (Holmes)|The Common Law]]'', which remains a classic in the field. Unlike Blackstone and the Restatements, Holmes' book only briefly discusses what the law ''is''; rather, Holmes describes the common law ''process''. Law professor [[John Chipman Gray]]'s ''The Nature and Sources of the Law'', an examination and survey of the common law, is also still commonly read in [[Law school in the United States|U.S. law schools]].

In the United States, [[Restatement of the Law|Restatements]] of various subject matter areas (Contracts, Torts, Judgments, and so on.), edited by the [[American Law Institute]], collect the common law for the area. The ALI Restatements are often cited by American courts and lawyers for propositions of uncodified common law, and are considered highly persuasive authority, just below binding precedential decisions. The [[Corpus Juris Secundum]] is an encyclopedia whose main content is a compendium of the common law and its variations throughout the various state jurisdictions.

Scots ''common law'' covers matters including murder and theft, and has sources in custom, in legal writings and previous court decisions. The legal writings used are called ''Institutional Texts'' and come mostly from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Examples include Craig, ''Jus Feudale'' (1655) and Stair, ''The Institutions of the Law of Scotland'' (1681).

In [[political science]], a  '''constitutional crisis''' is a problem or conflict in the function of a government that the [[constitution|political constitution]] or other fundamental governing law is perceived to be unable to resolve. There are several variations to this definition. For instance, one describes it as the crisis that arises out of the failure, or at least a strong risk of failure, of a constitution to perform its central functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Constitutions in the Global Financial Crisis: A Comparative Analysis|last=Contiades|first=Xenophon|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781409466314|location=Oxon|pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crisis may arise from a variety of possible causes. For example, a government may want to pass a law contrary to its constitution; the constitution may fail to provide a clear answer for a specific situation; the constitution may be clear but it may be politically infeasible to follow it; the government institutions themselves may falter or fail to live up to what the law prescribes them to be; or officials in the government may justify avoiding dealing with a serious problem based on narrow interpretations of the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The 4 Types Of Constitutional Crises | author=Azari, Julia; Masket, Seth | date=February 9, 2017 | url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/constitutional-crisis/ | website=FiveThirtyEight}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graber (2015), p. 244"&gt;{{cite book | title=A New Introduction to American Constitutionalism | author=Graber, Mark A. | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2015 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nHYRDAAAQBAJ | page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific examples include the South African [[Coloured vote constitutional crisis]] in the 1950s, the [[Secession in the United States|secession of the southern U.S. states]] in 1860 and 1861, and the [[2007 Ukrainian political crisis|2007 Ukrainian crisis]]. 

Constitutional crises may arise from conflicts between different branches of government, conflicts between central and local governments, or simply conflicts among various factions within society. In the course of government, the crisis results when one or more of the parties to a [[Controversy|political dispute]] willfully chooses to violate a law of the [[constitution]]; or to flout an unwritten [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]]; or to dispute the correct, legal interpretation of the violated constitutional law or of the flouted political custom. This was demonstrated by the so-called [[XYZ Affair]], which involved the bribery of French officials by a contingent of American commissioners who were sent to preserve peace between [[France]] and the United States.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Many, One: Readings in American Political and Social Thought|last=Sinopoli|first=Richard|publisher=Georgetown University Press|year=1996|isbn=0878406263|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was published in the American press and created a foreign policy crisis, which precipitated the passage of the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]]. Opposition to these acts in the form of the [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions|Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions]] cited that they violated the right to free speech and exhorted states to refuse their enforcement since they violated the Constitution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Moreover, if the crisis arises because the constitution is legally ambiguous, the ultimate politico-legal resolution usually establishes the legal precedent to resolve future crises of constitutional administration. In the U.S. system of government, the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] does not explicitly address the matter of whether or not a state can legally [[Secession in the United States|secede]] from the Union; however, after the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865) thwarted the secession of the [[Southern United States]], the accepted doctrine of constitutional law is that a state cannot legally leave the Union.{{Citation needed|reason=What specific doctrine?|date=June 2018}}

Politically, a constitutional crisis can lead to administrative paralysis and eventual collapse of the government, the loss of [[Legitimacy (political)|political legitimacy]], or to [[civil war]]. A constitutional crisis is distinct from a [[rebellion]], which occurs when political factions ''outside'' a government challenge the government's sovereignty, as in a ''[[coup d'état]]'' or a [[revolution]] led by the military or by civilians.

*Egypt experienced a constitutional crisis when President Mubarak was removed and the country was left without a president until President Morsi was elected and then again when Morsi was arrested until President Al-Sisi took office.&lt;ref name="Egypt's"&gt;{{cite news|title=Q&amp;A: Egypt constitutional crisis|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-20554079|work=BBC|date=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Professor Hillel Frisch on Egypt"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frisch|first1=Hillel|title=Egypt’s Constitutional Crisis|url=https://besacenter.org/perspectives-papers/egypts-constitutional-crisisthe-military-versus-the-islamists/#|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malawi===
* A constitutional crisis occurred in Malawi in 2012 with regard to the succession of [[Bingu wa Mutharika]]. The President and Vice-President were from different parties which led to deliberations over who the rightful successor would be and the [[Malawian Constitutional Crisis 2012|constitutional crisis]]. Vice-President [[Joyce Banda]] eventually succeeded wa Mutharika.

===Republic of The Gambia===
* Following the victory of [[Adama Barrow]] in the [[Gambian presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]], [[President of the Gambia|president]] [[Yahya Jammeh]] rejected the results and [[2016–2017 Gambian constitutional crisis|refused to step down]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/10/gambian-president-rejects-election-results-yahya-jammeh-adama-barrow|title=Gambian president Yahya Jammeh rejects election result |last= |first= |date=9 December 2016 |work= |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |agency=[[Reuters]] |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077 |access-date=19 January 2017 |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 January, Jammeh declared a 90-day state of emergency in an attempt to extend his term of office.

===Rhodesia===
* Amid demands from [[United Kingdom]] politicians to enfranchise the black majority population, the white minority government [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declared independence]] in 1965. The UK rejected the declaration and continued to claim sovereignty over Rhodesia until a framework for independence and black enfranchisement was negotiated in the 1979 [[Lancaster House Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Barber|year=2012|title=The Constitutional State}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
* The [[Coloured vote constitutional crisis]] (1951–55): The [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government disputed a court decision overturning its act to disenfranchise Coloured voters. Its attempt to reverse the decision in an ''ad hoc'' court was also overturned, after which the party used reforms to the Senate to pass the measure legally.

==Asia==

===Iran===
*[[Mohammed Reza Pahlavi]]'s 1953 dismissal of Prime Minister [[Mohammed Mossadegh]] and Mossadegh's subsequent refusal to quit the office

===Malaysia===
* [[1966 Sarawak constitutional crisis]] started by a group of politicians who were dissatisfied towards [[Stephen Kalong Ningkan]]'s leadership as chief minister. Ningkan was later removed from the chief minister post by the Governor of Sarawak in June 1966.
* The [[1983 Malaysian constitutional crisis]] saw [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]] [[Mahathir bin Mohamad|Mahathir]] pushing forward an amendment of Article 66 of the Federal Constitution, which set the time limit of the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong|Malaysian monarch]] to veto a law within 30 days. The proposals generated a great deal of controversy between the government and the monarchy, of which the former had to launch a public campaign to pressure the monarchy to assent to the amendments..{{clarify|date=November 2010}}
* The [[1988 Malaysian constitutional crisis]] was a series of events that began with the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO) party elections in 1987 and ended with the suspension and the eventual removal of [[Lord President of the Supreme Court]] [[Malay titles#Tun|Tun]] [[Salleh Abas]] from his seat.
* The [[1993 amendments to the Constitution of Malaysia]] (by some interpretations a constitutional crisis) involved the limitation of monarchs' [[sovereign immunity|legal immunity]] in Malaysia. Prime Minister [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]] successfully amended the constitution to make the monarchies more accountable to their actions.
*The [[2009 Perak constitutional crisis]] occurred in the Malaysian state of [[Perak]] when [[party switching|party defections]] caused the state ruling coalition, [[Pakatan Rakyat]], to lose its majority in the [[Dewan Undangan Negeri|state assembly]]. The [[Sultan of Perak]] refused to dissolve the state assembly when requested and dismissed the [[Menteri Besar]] (Chief Minister) in the absence of a [[motion of no confidence|no confidence]] vote.{{clarify|date=November 2010}}

===Pakistan===
*Supreme Court Chief Justice [[Sajjad Ali Shah]] clashed repeatedly with Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] in late 1997, accusing him of undermining the court's independence. After Ali Shah suspended a constitutional amendment that prevented dismissal of the prime minister, Sharif ordered President [[Farooq Leghari]] to appoint a new chief justice. When Leghari refused, Sharif considered [[impeach]]ing him, but backed down after a warning from the armed forces. Faced with a choice of accepting Sharif's demands or dismissing him, Leghari resigned. Ali Shah resigned shortly afterward, establishing Sharif's dominance.

===Thailand===
*In March 2006, 60 seats of the [[National Assembly of Thailand]] could not be elected, and Prime Minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] refused to resign. The judicial system did not lead up to Supreme Court as the top arbitrator so there were inconsistent rulings from the civil, criminal, administrative, and constitutional Courts.{{clarify|date=July 2012}}

===Sri Lanka===
{{main|2018 Sri Lankan constitutional crisis}}
*On the 26th of October 2018, President [[Maithripala Sirisena]] appointed former President [[Mahinda Rajapaksa]] as Prime Minister and dismissed incumbent Prime Minister [[Ranil Wickremesinghe]]. Ranil Wickremesinghe refused to accepted the dismissal while stating its unconstitutional and undemocratic.

==Europe==

===Belgium===
*The [[Royal Question]] over the status of king [[Leopold III of Belgium|Leopold III]] began when he acted against [[advice (constitutional)|ministerial advice]] during the [[Battle of Belgium|1940 Nazi invasion]] and refused to join [[Belgian government in exile|the government in exile]]. Deported to Germany before [[Liberation of Belgium|Belgium's 1944 liberation]], Leopold's return was narrowly approved in [[Belgian monarchy referendum, 1950|a 1950 referendum]] but a subsequent general strike prompted him to abdicate the following year.
*In 1990, [[Baudouin I of Belgium|King Baudouin]] refused routine [[Royal Assent]] to the law on [[abortion in Belgium]].  The issue was resolved by (constitutionally but controversially) having Baudouin temporarily declared incapable of reigning, the Council of Ministers giving assent as provided for in the [[Belgian Constitution]], and Baudouin declared capable again.

===Denmark===
*The [[Easter Crisis of 1920]], when [[Christian X of Denmark|King Christian X]] of [[Denmark]] dismissed the country's cabinet.

===England===
{{hatnote|For events after the formation of the United Kingdom in 1707, see {{section link|#United Kingdom}} below.}}

[[Image:Joao sem terra assina carta Magna.jpg|thumb|220px|right|''John of England signs Magna Carta''. Illustration from ''Cassell's History of England'' (1902)]]
*The succession crisis following the death of [[Edward the Confessor]] in 1066, settled by the invasion by [[William the Conqueror]]
*The  ''[[White Ship]]'' tragedy of 1120, which led to the succession crisis called [[The Anarchy]].
*The 1215 Barons' revolt against the rule of [[John of England|King John]], which led to the [[Magna Carta]].  Immediately, John repudiated Magna Carta, leading to the [[First Barons' War]]
*The [[History of the Church of England#Separation from Papal authority|Break with Rome]], in which [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] repudiated [[papal authority]] and created himself [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]], leading to the [[English Reformation]]
*[[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]'s insistence on the [[Divine Right of Kings]], manifest in his [[Personal Rule]] from 1629 to 1640, and leading directly to the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]
*The [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688–89: The flight of [[James II of England|King James II/VII]] from the country left no king in his place to rule England or Scotland or to summon a [[Parliament]].  When [[William III of England|King William]] and [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary]] jointly replaced him there was therefore no legally recognised Parliament to legitimise their irregular succession to the throne. This led to the [[Crown and Parliament Recognition Act 1689]].

===Estonia===
*The early 1930s political crisis in [[Estonia]] as two constitutional reforms had been rejected by the electorate and only the [[Estonian constitutional referendum, October 1933|third referendum]] in 1933 succeeded in replacing the [[parliamentary republic]] with the [[presidential republic]]. The succeeding constitutional reform was proposed by the [[Vaps Movement]], who were however kept from power by the [[self-coup]] of [[Prime Minister of Estonia|Prime Minister]] [[Konstantin Päts]], who was supported by the [[Riigikogu]].

===France===
*The [[16 May 1877 crisis]]: President [[Patrice de Mac-Mahon]] dismissed Prime Minister [[Jules Simon]] and named [[Albert de Broglie]] to replace him. The [[National Assembly]] refused to recognize the new government and a crisis, which ended with the dissolution of the Assembly and new elections, ensued.

===Germany===
* In the [[Weimar Republic]], for several years the country was governed with the help of [[enabling act]]s and emergency decrees. The crisis became dramatic in 1932, when the [[Nazi Party]] and [[Communist Party of Germany]] had together a majority in the parliament. Any government, installed by the [[President of Germany (1919–45)|Reich President]], was likely to be dismissed by the parliament. The crisis ended in a Nazi and conservative coalition government and then Nazi dictatorship. The [[Weimar Constitution|Weimar constitution]] was not abolished but made obsolete.

===Malta===
*The [[Maltese general election, 1981|1981 election]], when, due to a quirk in that country's [[Single Transferrable Vote]] system, the party winning more than half the votes won fewer than half the seats in parliament.

===Norway===
*[[Impeachment (Norway)|Impeachment]] of prime minister Selmer's cabinet in 1883/1884 regarding the king's right to veto changes to the constitution, and establishment of an ad-hoc parliamentary practice until amended to the constitution in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[[Monarchy of Norway#Council of State]]{{Better source|reason=self-ref|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Storting]]{{Better source|reason=self-ref|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.liberaleren.no/2007/02/20/parlamentarismen-inn-i-grunnloven/&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905]]{{Elucidate|date=November 2018}}

===Rome===
*The crossing of the [[Rubicon]] by [[Julius Caesar]] in 49 BC with his legions. This action, which had no precedent, precipitated a crisis only fully resolved in 31 BC, when [[Augustus|Octavian]] defeated all his enemies to become the sole master of the Roman world.

===Russia===
*The [[Russian constitutional crisis of 1993|constitutional crisis of 1993]]: a conflict between [[President of Russia|Russian President]] [[Boris Yeltsin]] and the Russian parliament led by [[Ruslan Khasbulatov]]. It emerged due to disagreements regarding the demarcation of political authority. Russian leaders agreed to hold a referendum in April 1993 that would determine whether the presidency or the parliament would be the dominant institution in the Russian political system.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Presidential Power in Russia|last=Huskey|first=Eugene|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781315482194|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parliament temporarily reneged on its commitment to a referendum and it prompted Yeltsin to issue a decree giving the president more authority. This was met with resistance even from among figures within the executive department such as Yurii Shokov, chair of the president's Security Council and [[Aleksandr Rutskoy]], Yeltsin's Vice President.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Anticipating impeachment, Yeltsin dissolved the parliament in September 21, 1993 and called for fresh elections.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Politics and the Russian Army: Civil-Military Relations, 1689-2000|last=Taylor|first=Brian|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=0521816742|location=Cambridge|pages=282}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president did not have the constitutional authority to do this and the Constitutional Court promptly ruled that the decree was unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This resulted to ten days of street fighting between the police, pro-parliamentary demonstrators, and groups loyal to the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of the Russian Federation|last=Saunders|first=Robert|last2=Strukov|first2=Vlad|publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc.|year=2010|isbn=|location=Lanham, MD|pages=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aleksandr Rutskoy was sworn as the acting President of Russia for a few days. The crisis ended after a military siege of the parliament building, which claimed 187 lives. 

===Scotland===
This covers the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], which became part of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] after 1707. For constitutional crises since then, see [[Constitutional crisis#Constitutional Crises in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] below.
*The succession crisis resulting from the death of [[Margaret of Scotland (Maid of Norway)|Queen Margaret]] in 1290. [[Edward I of England]], whose [[Edward II of England|son Edward]] was to marry Margaret, was asked to arbitrate, and chose [[John Balliol]], who swore an [[oath of fealty]] to Edward, turning Scotland into an English vassal in 1292.  Soon, Balliol and the [[Scottish nobility]] revolted, leading to the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]].

===Spain===
[[File:President_Puigdemont,_"Ciutadans_de_Catalunya,_vénen_hores_en_què_a_tots_ens_pertocarà_de_mantenir_el_pols_del_nostre_país"_02.jpg|thumb|[[President of the Generalitat of Catalonia|Catalan president]], [[Carles Puigdemont]], addresses the crowd following the unilateral declaration of independence on 27 October]]
*The [[2017–18 Spanish constitutional crisis]] saw the [[Government of Spain]] and the [[Generalitat of Catalonia]] clashing over the latter's planning of an [[Catalan independence referendum, 2017|independence referendum]] on 1 October 2017, leading to the Catalan government openly defying instructions from the [[Spanish Constitutional Court]] and in state prosecutors filling criminal charges on Catalan leading officials for rebellion, disobedience, misusing public funds and making deliberately unlawful decisions. General strikes and tense demonstrations took place during these weeks. On 27 October, the [[Parliament of Catalonia]] tried to found a Catalan republic with a [[Catalan declaration of independence|unilateral declaration of independence]]. At the same time, the [[Senate of Spain|Senate]] approved the application of [[Constitution of Spain#Article 155|Article 155]] of the [[Constitution of Spain|Constitution]], which led to the cessation of the Catalan Government, the dissolution of parliament, the call for [[Catalan regional election, 2017|elections]] for 21 December and the direct rule over Catalonia. The [[Supreme Court of Spain|Supreme Court]] imprisoned a large part of the Puigdemont executive, the [[Carme Forcadell|Speaker of the Parliament]] and the two leaders of the two major independentists civil associations, as well as the flight to Belgium, Switzerland, Germany and Scotland of President [[Puigdemont]], four regional ex-regional ministers and two political leaders. For July 2018, the direct rule ended and the prisoners are still in preventive jail in Catalan prisons.

===United Kingdom===
*The rejection of the 1909 [[People's Budget]] by the [[House of Lords]]. This caused a two-year impasse, leading to the [[Parliament Act 1911]].&lt;ref name="bogdanor"&gt;{{cite book|first=Vernon|last=Bogdanor|year=1997|title=The Monarchy and the Constitution}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 1936 [[Edward VIII abdication crisis]], when [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]] proposed to marry divorcee [[Wallis, The Duchess of Windsor|Wallis Simpson]] against the advice of his ministers.

==North America==

===Canada===
*In the [[King-Byng Affair]] of 1926, [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Viscount Byng of Vimy]] refused the request of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] to [[dissolution of parliament|dissolve Parliament]] and call new elections after King had, months before, refused to resign.  Instead, Byng dismissed King and appointed [[Arthur Meighen]] as Prime Minister, after which Meighen found himself unable to retain [[confidence (politics)|confidence]], triggering his own resignation and an election.  Reaction to the affair was reflected in the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]], the resulting separation of [[British Dominions|Dominion]] [[Governors General]] from the British government, and the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] that made each realm of the Crown independent.
*The 1936 [[Edward VIII abdication crisis]], when [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]] proposed to marry divorcee [[Wallis, The Duchess of Windsor|Wallis Simpson]] against the advice of his ministers.
*The 1982 [[patriation]] of the [[British North America Act]] was contentious, as there were conflicting opinions from the federal government, provincial governments, and [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] over what exactly the procedure was whereby Canada could request a [[constitutional amendment]] from [[the United Kingdom]].  The Supreme Court's decision in the [[Quebec Veto Reference]] found that [[Quebec]] did not have a veto on patriation, and the process was legitimate and binding.  The [[National Assembly of Quebec]] symbolically refuses to ratify the Constitution Act in its current form.&lt;!-- Is this a crisis?  The government seems to have continued operating since 1982. --&gt;{{cn|date=January 2017}}
*The [[2008–2009 Canadian parliamentary dispute]], in which [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]], [[New Democratic Party|NDP]], and [[Bloc Québécois]] Members of Parliament attempted to have a vote of non-confidence against the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] government and replace it with a coalition government, was unprecedented in the Canadian constitutional system, as formal party-based co-operation was rare. [[Stephen Harper|Prime Minister Stephen Harper]] controversially advised the Governor General to [[Prorogation in Canada|prorogue]] Parliament. The coalition effort subsequently fell apart, leaving the key questions around the dispute unanswered.

===Honduras===
*The [[2009 Honduran constitutional crisis]] saw President [[Manuel Zelaya]] attempting to hold a non-binding referendum which [[National Congress of Honduras|Congress]] and the [[Supreme Court of Honduras|Supreme Court]] deemed unconstitutional. The military, following orders from the Supreme Court, arrested President Zelaya.

===United States===
[[File:Electoral Commission (United States).jpg|right|thumb|220px|The Electoral Commission was a panel that resolved the disputed presidential election of 1876.]]

*The [[Stamp Act 1765]], by which the British Parliament sought to tax the [[Thirteen Colonies]], set off protests from colonial politicians against [[taxation without representation]]. Parliament continued to assert its authority in subsequent acts, throwing colonial governments into chaos and eventually leading the colonists to declare total independence from Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=H. T.|last=Dickinson|year=2014|title=Britain and the American Revolution}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Nullification Crisis]] of 1832, in which [[South Carolina]] declared that it would not permit collection of a federal tariff.  The United States Congress eventually passed a law to authorize the President to use military force in South Carolina to enforce federal laws, as well as a revised tariff law with lower rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard E.|last=Ellis|year=1989|title=The Union at Risk: Jacksonian Democracy, States' Rights and the Nullification Crisis}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1841 the death of President [[William Henry Harrison]] resulted in Vice-President [[John Tyler]] becoming President, the first vice-president to succeed to the presidency. He assumed full presidential powers, although there was doubt whether the actual office of President "devolved" upon the Vice President or merely its powers and duties. The "Tyler Precedent" governed future successions and eventually became codified in the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fifth Amendment]]. Some opposition Whig members of Congress, including [[John Quincy Adams]] and [[Henry Clay]], held that Tyler should be a [[Caretaker government#Caretakers|caretaker]] under the title of [[Acting President of the United States|"Acting President"]]. He was referred to as "His Accidency".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Unsuccessful amendments had been proposed in both houses to strike out the word "President" in favor of language including the term "Vice President" for such cases. Tyler had correspondence from his political opponents to the White House addressed to the "Vice President" or "Acting President" returned unopened.&lt;ref name="Abbott2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Philip Abbott|title=Accidental Presidents: Death, Assassination, Resignation, and Democratic Succession|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NdzGAAAAQBAJ|date=23 June 2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-230-61303-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the [[Watergate scandal]] (1972–74), President [[Richard Nixon]] and his staff obstructed investigations into their political activities. Nixon resigned, under threat of impeachment, after the release of an audio tape showing that he had personally approved the obstruction.

Prior to the Independent Counsel Act a Special Prosecutor was still under the authority of the President and any investigations into the executive branch could be stopped by the President by simply firing the Special Prosecutor.

===Australia===
*The 1936 [[Edward VIII abdication crisis]], when [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]] proposed to marry divorcee [[Wallis, The Duchess of Windsor|Wallis Simpson]] against the advice of his ministers.
*The [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]] saw the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Gough Whitlam]] and his government dismissed by the nation's [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Sir John Kerr]], in response to a prolonged budget deadlock in Parliament.  This occurred even though Whitlam's government had the [[confidence (politics)|confidence]] of the lower house, the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. In the [[Australian Constitution]], the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] has equal powers with the House of Representatives, except it may not initiate or amend a [[supply bill]]. It can, however, reject or defer consideration of such a bill, and that is what it did on this occasion.
*In 2017, the [[2017 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis|eligibility of certain Australian parliamentarians]] to sit in the [[Parliament of Australia]] was called into question because of their actual or possible [[dual citizenship]].

===Fiji===
*In the [[1977 Fijian constitutional crisis|Fiji constitutional crisis of 1977]], the winning party in a general election failed to name a government due to internal conflicts. The [[Governor-General of Fiji|Governor-General]] intervened, appointing a prime minister from the opposition party.

===New Zealand===
*The 1936 [[Edward VIII abdication crisis]], when [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]] proposed to marry divorcee [[Wallis, The Duchess of Windsor|Wallis Simpson]] against the advice of his ministers.
*The [[New Zealand constitutional crisis, 1984|New Zealand constitutional crisis of 1984]] was caused by [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] [[Rob Muldoon|Sir Rob Muldoon]]'s refusal to devalue the [[New Zealand dollar|dollar]] as per the instructions of the Prime Minister-elect, [[David Lange]].  The outgoing cabinet rebelled against Muldoon, who relented.  The upshot was the passage of the [[Constitution Act 1986 (NZ)|Constitution Act]], which patriated the constitution from the United Kingdom.

===Papua New Guinea===
*The [[2011–2012 Papua New Guinean constitutional crisis|Papua New Guinean constitutional crisis of 2011–2012]] was caused by a disagreement, involving every branch of government including the [[Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea|Supreme Court]], as to who the legitimate [[Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea|Prime Minister]] was. Specifically, whether Prime Minister [[Michael Somare]]'s dismissal by the Speaker of the [[National Parliament of Papua New Guinea|National Parliament]] while he was in hospital had been lawful. After ten months, the crisis was resolved peacefully by [[Papua New Guinean general election, 2012|a general election]].

===Tuvalu===
*The [[Tuvaluan constitutional crisis|Tuvaluan constitutional crisis of 2013]] occurred when Prime Minister [[Willy Telavi]] sought to continue governing after having lost his parliamentary majority. He deferred allowing Parliament to sit, and his ally Speaker [[Kamuta Latasi]] did not allow a [[motion of no confidence]] to be tabled when it finally did sit. The Opposition accused the government of acting unconstitutionally, and [[Governor General of Tuvalu|Governor General]] Sir [[Iakoba Italeli]] intervened, removing the Prime Minister from office so that Parliament could decide who should form the government. Telavi sought in vain to ask the [[monarchy of Tuvalu|Queen of Tuvalu]], [[Elizabeth II]], to remove the Governor General. Parliament elected Opposition Leader [[Enele Sopoaga]] to the premiership.

{{Libertarianism sidebar |Related}}

'''Constitutionalism''' is "a complex of ideas, attitudes, and patterns of behavior elaborating the principle that the authority of government derives from and is limited by [[Constitutional law|a body of fundamental law]]".&lt;ref&gt;Don E. Fehrenbacher, ''Constitutions and Constitutionalism in the Slaveholding South'' (University of Georgia Press, 1989). p. 1. {{ISBN|978-0-8203-1119-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political organizations are constitutional to the extent that they "contain [[institution]]alized mechanisms of power control for the protection of the interests and [[Liberty|liberties]] of the [[citizenry]], including those that may be in the [[Minority group|minority]]".&lt;ref name="Gordon1999"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gordon |first=Scott |title=Controlling the State: Constitutionalism from Ancient Athens to Today |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1999 |page=4 |isbn=0-674-16987-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; As described by political scientist and constitutional scholar [[David Fellman]]:
{{quote|Constitutionalism is descriptive of a complicated concept, deeply embedded in historical experience, which subjects the officials who exercise governmental powers to the limitations of a higher law. Constitutionalism proclaims the desirability of the rule of law as opposed to rule by the arbitrary judgment or mere fiat of public officials&amp;nbsp;...  Throughout the literature dealing with modern public law and the foundations of statecraft the central element of the concept of constitutionalism is that in political society government officials are not free to do anything they please in any manner they choose; they are bound to observe both the limitations on power and the procedures which are set out in the supreme, constitutional law of the community. It may therefore be said that the touchstone of constitutionalism is the concept of limited government under a higher law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-61 Philip P. Wiener, ed., "Dictionary of the History of Ideas: Studies of Selected Pivotal Ideas"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623044421/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-61 |date=2006-06-23 }}, (David Fellman, "Constitutionalism"), vol 1, pp. 485, 491–92 (1973–74) ("Whatever particular form of government a constitution delineates, however, it serves as the keystone of the arch of constitutionalism, except in those countries whose written constitutions are mere sham. Constitutionalism as a theory and in practice stands for the principle that there are—in a properly governed state—limitations upon those who exercise the powers of government, and that these limitations are spelled out in a body of higher law which is enforceable in a variety of ways, political and judicial. This is by no means a modern idea, for the concept of a higher law which spells out the basic norms of a political society is as old as Western civilization. That there are standards of rightness which transcend and control public officials, even current popular majorities, represents a critically significant element of man's endless quest for the good life.")&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Usage ==
Constitutionalism has prescriptive and descriptive uses. Law professor [[Gerhard Casper]] captured this aspect of the term in noting, "Constitutionalism has both descriptive and prescriptive connotations.  Used descriptively, it refers chiefly to the historical struggle for constitutional recognition of the people's right to 'consent' and certain other rights, freedoms, and privileges. Used prescriptively, its meaning incorporates those features of government seen as the essential elements of the... Constitution".&lt;ref name="Leonard Levy p. 473, 473"&gt;Leonard Levy, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the American Constitution'', (Gerhard Casper, "Constitutionalism"), vol 2, p. 473 (1986) {{ISBN|978-0-02-864880-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descriptive===
One example of constitutionalism's descriptive use is law professor Bernard Schwartz's five volume compilation of sources seeking to trace the origins of the U.S. Bill of Rights.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Schwartz, ''The Roots of the Bill of Rights'' (5 vols., Chelsea House Publisher, 1980) {{ISBN|978-0877542070}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with English antecedents going back to [[Magna Carta]] (1215), Schwartz explores the presence and development of ideas of individual freedoms and privileges through colonial charters and legal understandings. Then in carrying the story forward, he identifies revolutionary declarations and [[constitution]]s, documents and judicial decisions of the Confederation period and the formation of the federal Constitution. Finally, he turns to the debates over the federal Constitution's ratification that ultimately provided mounting pressure for a federal bill of rights. While hardly presenting a straight line, the account illustrates the historical struggle to recognize and enshrine constitutional rights and principles in a constitutional order.

===Prescriptive===
In contrast to describing what constitutions are, a prescriptive approach addresses what a constitution should be. As presented by the Canadian philosopher [[Wil Waluchow]], constitutionalism embodies
{{quote|the idea&amp;nbsp;... that government can and should be legally limited in its powers, and that its authority depends on its observing these limitations. This idea brings with it a host of vexing questions of interest not only to legal scholars, but to anyone keen to explore the legal and philosophical foundations of the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/constitutionalism ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''], Wil Waluchow "Constitutionalism" (Intro Jan. 2001 (revised Feb. 20, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;}}
One example of this prescriptive approach was the project of the National Municipal League&lt;ref&gt;Frank Mann Stewart, ''A Half Century of Municipal Reform: A History of the National Municipal League'' Ch.2 (Univ. of California Press, 1950).&lt;/ref&gt; to develop a model state constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laits.utexas.edu/txp_media/html/cons/features/0301_02/modelcons.pdf|title=''Model State Constitution''|author=|date=|website=utexas.edu|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226004540/http://www.laits.utexas.edu/txp_media/html/cons/features/0301_02/modelcons.pdf|archivedate=26 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authority of government===
Whether reflecting a descriptive or prescriptive focus, treatments of the concept of constitutionalism all deal with the legitimacy of government. One recent assessment of American constitutionalism, for example, notes that the idea of constitutionalism serves to define what it is that "grants and guides the legitimate exercise of government authority".&lt;ref&gt;Christian G. Fritz, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZpKCvUacmSwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA168 ''American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008). p. 1.] {{ISBN|978-0-521-88188-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, historian Gordon S. Wood described this American constitutionalism as "advanced thinking" on the nature of constitutions in which the constitution was conceived to be a "''sett of fundamental rules'' by which even the supreme power of the state shall be governed."&lt;ref&gt;Gordon S. Wood, ''The Creation of the American Republic, 1770–1787'' (Norton &amp; Co. 1969). p. 268. {{ISBN|0-393-31040-X}} (quoting Demophilus, [http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2066&amp;chapter=155889&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 ''Genuine Principles''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511123036/http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2066&amp;chapter=155889&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 |date=2011-05-11 }}. p. 4&gt; (Demophilus [George Bryan?]: ''the Genuine Principles of the Ancient Saxon, Or English [,] Constitution'').&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, American constitutionalism came to rest on the collective sovereignty of the people, the source that legitimized American governments.

===Fundamental law empowering and limiting government===
One of the most salient features of constitutionalism is that it describes and prescribes both the source and the limits of government power. William H. Hamilton has captured this dual aspect by noting that constitutionalism "is the name given to the trust which men repose in the power of words engrossed on parchment to keep a government in order."&lt;ref&gt;Walton H. Hamilton, "Constitutionalism". in Edwin R.A. Seligman, et al. (eds) ''Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'' (New York: Macmillan 1931). p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Constitutionalism and constitutional questions ==
The study of constitutions is not necessarily synonymous with the study of constitutionalism.  Although frequently conflated, there are crucial differences.

Fritz's ''American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War'',&lt;ref&gt;(Cambridge University Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; a study of the early history of American constitutionalism.

However,

{{quote|These political and constitutional controversies also posed questions of constitutionalism—how to identify the collective sovereign, what powers the sovereign possessed, and how one recognized when that sovereign acted. Unlike constitutional questions, questions of constitutionalism could not be answered by reference to given constitutional text or even judicial opinions. Rather, they were open-ended questions drawing upon competing views Americans developed after Independence about the sovereignty of the people and the ongoing role of the people to monitor the constitutional order that rested on their sovereign authority.&lt;ref name="Fritz" /&gt;}}

A similar distinction was drawn by British constitutional scholar [[A.V. Dicey]] in assessing Britain's unwritten constitution. Dicey noted a difference between the "conventions of the constitution" and the "law of the constitution". The "essential distinction" between the two concepts was that the law of the constitution was made up of "rules enforced or recognised by the Courts", making up "a body of 'laws' in the proper sense of that term." In contrast, the conventions of the constitution consisted "of customs, practices, maxims, or precepts which are not enforced or recognised by the Courts" but "make up a body not of laws, but of constitutional or [[political ethics]]".&lt;ref&gt;Dicey, A. V., [http://www.constitution.org/cmt/avd/law_con.htm ''Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040408171308/http://www.constitution.org/cmt/avd/law_con.htm |date=2004-04-08 }}, 8th ed.

== Constitutional economics ==
Constitutionalism has been the subject of criticism for its previous ignorance of economic issues but this criticism is now taken into account by the development of [[constitutional economics]].

Constitutional economics is a field of [[economics]] and constitutionalism and describes and analyzes the specific interrelationships between constitutional issues and the structure and functioning of the [[economy]]. The term “constitutional economics” was used by American economist [[James M. Buchanan]] as a name for a new academic sub-discipline. Buchanan received in 1986 the [[Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences]] for his "development of the contractual and constitutional bases for the theory of economic and political decision-making".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1986/buchanan.html|title=James M. Buchanan Jr. - Facts|author=|date=|website=nobelprize.org|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531002802/http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1986/buchanan.html|archivedate=31 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buchanan rejects "any organic conception of the state as superior in wisdom, to the individuals who are its members". This philosophical position is, in fact, the very subject matter of constitutional economics.

A constitutional economics approach allows for a combined economic and constitutional analysis, helping to avoid an unidimensional understanding. Buchanan believes that a constitution, intended for use by at least several generations of citizens, must be able to adjust itself for pragmatic economic decisions and to balance interests of the [[state (polity)|state]] and [[society]] against those of individuals and their constitutional rights to [[personal freedom]] and private [[happiness]]. Constitutional economics draws substantial inspiration from the reformist attitude which is characteristic of [[Adam Smith]]'s vision, and that Buchanan’s concept can be considered the modern-day counterpart to what Smith called "the science of [[legislation]]".

Concurrently with the rise of academic research in the field of constitutional economics in the U.S. in the 1980s, the [[Supreme Court of India]] for almost a decade had been encouraging [[public interest litigation]] on behalf of the poor and oppressed by using a very broad interpretation of several articles of the [[Indian Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Cooper, "Poverty and Constitutional Justice", in ''Philosophy of Law: Classic and Contemporary Readings'', edited by Larry May and Jeff Brown. Wiley-Blackwell, UK, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This is a vivid example of a ''de facto'' practical application of the methodology of constitutional economics.

The Russian school of constitutional economics was created in the early 21st century with the idea that constitutional economics allows for a combined economic and constitutional analysis in the legislative (especially budgetary) process, thus helping to overcome arbitrariness in the economic and financial decision-making: for instance, when military expenses (and the like) dwarf the budget spending on education and culture. In the [[English language]], the word "constitution" possesses a whole number of meanings, encompassing not only national constitutions as such, but also charters of public organizations, unwritten rules of various clubs, informal groups, etc. The Russian model of constitutional economics, originally intended for transitional and [[developing countries]], focuses entirely on the concept of the state constitution. In 2006, the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] officially recognized constitutional economics as a separate academic sub-discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, Natalya Merkulova. [http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/worldruleoflaw.pdf "The 25th Anniversary of Constitutional Economics: The Russian Model and Legal Reform in Russia" in ''The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032342/http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/worldruleoflaw.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}, edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen. Justitsinform, Moscow (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Since many countries with transitional political and economic systems continue to treat their constitutions as abstract legal documents disengaged from the economic policy of the state, the practice of constitutional economics becomes there a decisive prerequisite for democratic development of the state and society.

== Examples ==

===Descriptive===
Used descriptively, the concept of constitutionalism can refer chiefly to the historical struggle for constitutional recognition of the people's right to "consent" and certain other rights, freedoms, and privileges.&lt;ref name="Leonard Levy p. 473, 473"/&gt;

====United States====
American constitutionalism has been defined as a complex of ideas, attitudes and patterns elaborating the principle that the authority of government derives from the people, and is limited by a body of fundamental law. These ideas, attitudes and patterns, according to one analyst, derive from "a dynamic political and historical process rather than from a static body of thought laid down in the eighteenth century".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;docId=103280003 Stephen M. Griffin, "American Constitutionalism: From Theory to Politics"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812002649/http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;docId=103280003 |date=2011-08-12 }} (Princeton University Press, 1996). p. 5. {{ISBN|978-0-691-03404-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In U.S. history, constitutionalism, in both its descriptive and prescriptive sense, has traditionally focused on the federal constitution. Indeed, a routine assumption of many scholars has been that understanding "American constitutionalism" necessarily entails the thought that went into the drafting of the federal constitution and the American experience with that constitution since its ratification in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;For the assumptions by historians, political scientists and lawyers that have contributed to a view of constitutionalism essentially connected and confined to the US Constitution, see Christian G. Fritz, [http://works.bepress.com/christian_fritz/1/ "Fallacies of American Constitutionalism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511124225/http://works.bepress.com/christian_fritz/1/ |date=2011-05-11 }} ," 35 ''Rutgers Law Journal'' (2004), 1327–69. See also Christian G. Fritz, ''American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008). p. 284 ("Invariably, the state constitutional tradition is deemed less authentic because of its departure from the federal model. This has led to the assumption that one need only study the federal Constitution to discover what American constitutionalism was then and is today.") {{ISBN|978-0-521-88188-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a rich tradition of state constitutionalism that offers broader insight into constitutionalism in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;G. Alan Tarr, ''Understanding State Constitutions'' (Princeton Univ. Press, 1998) and John J. Dinan, T''he American State Constitutional Tradition'' (Univ. Press of Kansas, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; While state constitutions and the federal constitution operate differently as a function of federalism from the coexistence and interplay of governments at both a national and state level, they all rest on a shared assumption that their legitimacy comes from the sovereign authority of the people or [[popular sovereignty]]. This underlying premise, embraced by the American revolutionaries with the [[Declaration of Independence]] unites American constitutional tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Paul K. Conkin, ''Self-Evident Truths: Being a Discourse on the Origins &amp; Development of the First Principles of American Government – Popular Sovereignty, Natural Rights, and Balance &amp; Separation of Powers'' (Indiana Univ. Press, 1974), p. 52 (describing "the almost unanimous acceptance of popular sovereignty at the level of abstract principle"); Edmund S. Morgan, "The Problem of Popular Sovereignty," in ''Aspects of American Liberty: Philosophical, Historical and Political'' (The American Philosophical Society, 1977), p. 101 (concluding the American Revolution "confirmed and completed the subordination of government to the will of the people"); Willi Paul Adams, ''The First American Constitutions: Republican Ideology and the Making of the State Constitutions in the Revolutionary Era'' (University of North Carolina Press, 1980), p. 137 (asserting that statements of the "principle" of the people's sovereignty "expressed the very heart of the consensus among the victors of 1776").&lt;/ref&gt;

Both experience with state constitutions before and after the federal constitution as well as the emergence and operation of the latter reflect an ongoing struggle over the idea that all governments in America rested on the sovereignty of the people for their legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Christian G. Fritz, ''American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008). p. 284 (Observing that from the Revolutionary era to the period before the Civil War "Americans continued to wrestle with what it meant that their national as well as state governments rested on the sovereignty of the people") {{ISBN|978-0-521-88188-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
The United Kingdom is perhaps the best instance of constitutionalism in a country that has an [[uncodified constitution]]. A variety of developments in 17th century England, including "the protracted struggle for power between [[King of the United Kingdom|King]] and [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] was accompanied by an efflorescence of political ideas in which the concept of countervailing powers was clearly defined,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

====Japan====
The recent move of the Japanese government for revisions of its 1947 constitution under [[Shinzō Abe]]'s administration is criticized as anticonstitutionalist in the sense that the new constitution would impose obligations on citizens rather than protect their human rights.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

====Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth====
From the mid-sixteenth to the late eighteenth century, the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] utilized the ''[[liberum veto]]'', a form of [[unanimity|unanimity voting rule]], in its parliamentary deliberations. The "principle of ''liberum veto'' played an important role in [the] emergence of the unique Polish form of constitutionalism." This constraint on the powers of the monarch were significant in making the "[r]ule of law, religious tolerance and limited constitutional government... the norm in Poland in times when the rest of Europe was being devastated by religious hatred and despotism."&lt;ref name="Rohac2008"&gt;{{cite journal

===Prescriptive===
The prescriptive approach to constitutionalism addresses what a constitution should be.  Two observations might be offered about its prescriptive use.
* There is often confusion in equating the presence of a written constitution with the conclusion that a state or polity is one based upon constitutionalism. As noted by [[David Fellman]], constitutionalism "should not be taken to mean that if a state has a constitution, it is necessarily committed to the idea of constitutionalism. In a very real sense... every state may be said to have a constitution, since every state has institutions which are at the very least expected to be permanent, and every state has established ways of doing things". But even with a "formal written document labelled 'constitution' which includes the provisions customarily found in such a document, it does not follow that it is committed to constitutionalism...."&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-61 Philip P. Wiener, ed., "Dictionary of the History of Ideas: Studies of Selected Pivotal Ideas", (David Fellman, "Constitutionalism")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623044421/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-61 |date=2006-06-23 }}, vol 1, p. 485 (1973–74).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Often the word "constitutionalism" is used in a  rhetorical sense, as a political argument that equates the views of the speaker or writer with a preferred view of the constitution. For instance, University of Maryland Constitutional History Professor Herman Belz's critical assessment of expansive constitutional construction notes that "constitutionalism... ought to be recognized as a distinctive ideology and approach to political life.... Constitutionalism not only establishes the institutional and intellectual framework, but it also supplies much of the rhetorical currency with which political transactions are carried on."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/cmt/belz/lcfl_07.txt Herman Belz, "A Living Constitution or Fundamental Law? American Constitutionalism in Historical Perspective"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202001956/http://www.constitution.org/cmt/belz/lcfl_07.txt |date=2008-12-02 }} (Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc. 1998) at pp. 148–49 (Belz further argues: "Constitutionalism shapes political life in a variety of ways. Constitutional principles can become matters of commitment and belief possessing intrinsic value that motivate political action.... When citizens and governing officials internalize constitutional values, acting out of fidelity to law rather than expediency, constitutionalism gives direction to political life. Constitutionalism has a configurative effect also in providing the forms, rhetoric, and symbols by which politics is carried on. Political groups and individuals ordinarily try to choose courses of action that are consistent with or required by the Constitution. They do so not because they are in each instance committed to the constitutional principle or value at issue... [but] because they know that the public takes the Constitution seriously, believing that it embodies fundamental values and formal procedures that are the touchstone of political legitimacy. In American politics the Constitution is a justifying concept, and groups that invoke constitutional arguments do so, from their own perspective perhaps and in an immediate sense, instrumentally. Considered from an external and long-range view in relation to the polity as a whole, however, reliance on constitutional principles and rules is normative and noninstrumental. In this way constitutionalism shapes political events") {{ISBN|978-0-8476-8643-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Georgetown University Law Center Professor [[Louis Michael Seidman]] noted as well the confluence of political rhetoric with arguments supposedly rooted in constitutionalism. In assessing the "meaning that critical scholars attributed to constitutional law in the late twentieth century," Professor Seidman notes a "new order... characterized most prominently by extremely aggressive use of legal argument and rhetoric" and as a result "powerful legal actors are willing to advance arguments previously thought out-of-bounds.  They have, in short, used legal reasoning to do exactly what crits claim legal reasoning always does—put the lipstick of disinterested constitutionalism on the pig of raw politics."&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.fordham.edu/publications/articles/500flspub9546.pdf Louis Michael Seidman, "Critical Constitutionalism Now"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910120855/http://law.fordham.edu/publications/articles/500flspub9546.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }}, 75 Fordham Law Review pp. 575, 586 (Nov. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
{{main|Constitutionalism in the United States}}
Starting with the proposition that "'Constitutionalism' refers to the position or practice that [[government]] be limited by a [[constitution]], usually written," analysts take a variety of positions on what the constitution means. For instance, they describe the document as a document that may specify its relation to statutes, treaties, executive and judicial actions, and the constitutions or laws of regional jurisdictions. This prescriptive use of Constitutionalism is also concerned with the [[Constitution#Principles of constitutional design|principles of constitutional design]], which includes the principle that the field of public action be partitioned between [[Delegation|delegated powers]] to the [[government]] and the [[rights]] of individuals, each of which is a restriction of the other, and that no powers be delegated that are beyond the competence of government.&lt;ref&gt;James Madison, in his remarks introducing the Bill of Rights, 8 June 1789, ''Annals'' 1:424–50. [http://www.constitution.org/ac/001/r01-1/bill_of_rights_hr1789.htm Link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504011004/http://www.constitution.org/ac/001/r01-1/bill_of_rights_hr1789.htm |date=2009-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth====
The [[Constitution of May 3, 1791]], which historian [[Norman Davies]] calls "the first constitution of its kind in Europe",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jrVW9W9eiYMC&amp;pg=PA699 |first=Norman |last=Davies |title=Europe: A History |year=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=699 |isbn=0-19-820171-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; was in effect for only a year. It was designed to redress longstanding political defects of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and its traditional system of "Golden Liberty". The Constitution introduced political equality between townspeople and nobility (''szlachta'') and placed the peasants under the protection of the government, thus mitigating the worst abuses of serfdom.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

====United Kingdom====
{{see also|Constitution of the United Kingdom}}
[[Constitutionalist (UK)|Constitutionalist]] was also a label used by some independent candidates in [[UK general election]]s in the early 1920s. Most of the candidates were former [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] members, and many of them joined the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] soon after being elected. The best known Constitutionalist candidate was [[Winston Churchill]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1924|1924 UK general election]].&lt;ref&gt;British parliamentary election results 1918–1949, Craig, F.W.S.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dominican Republic====
After the democratically elected government of president [[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]] in the Dominican Republic was deposed, the Constitutionalist movement was born in the country. As opposed to said movement, the Anticonstitutionalist movement was also born. Bosch had to depart to [[Puerto Rico]] after he was deposed. His first leader was Colonel Rafael Tomás Fernández Domínguez, and he wanted Bosch to come back to power once again. Colonel Fernández Domínguez was exiled to Puerto Rico where Bosch was. The Constitutionalists had a new leader: [[Francisco Caamaño|Colonel Francisco Alberto Caamaño Deñó]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

== Criticisms ==
Legal scholar [[Jeremy Waldron]] contends that constitutionalism is often undemocratic:
{{quote|Constitutions are not just about retraining and limiting power; they are about the empowerment of ordinary people in a democracy and allowing them to control the sources of law and harness the apparatus of government to their aspirations. That is the democratic view of constitutions, but it is not the constitutionalist view.... Of course, it is always possible to present an alternative to constitutionalism as an alternative form of constitutionalism: scholars talk of "popular constitutionalism" or "democratic constitutionalism."... But I think it is worth setting out a stark version of the antipathy between constitutionalism and democratic or popular self-government, if only because that will help us to measure more clearly the extent to which a new and mature theory of constitutional law takes proper account of the constitutional burden of ensuring that the people are not disenfranchised by the very document that is supposed to give them their power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Contemporary Debates in Political Philosophy|year=2009|editor=Christiano, Thomas |editor2=Christman, John|page=279|chapter=Constitutionalism – A Skeptical View}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Constitutionalism has also been the subject of criticism by [[Murray Rothbard]], who attacked constitutionalism as incapable of restraining governments and does not protect the rights of citizens from their governments:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[i]t is true that, in the [[United States]], at least, we have a constitution that imposes strict limits on some powers of government. But, as we have discovered in the past century, no constitution can interpret or enforce itself; it must be interpreted by ''men''. And if the ultimate power to interpret a constitution is given to the government's own Supreme Court, then the inevitable tendency is for the Court to continue to place its imprimatur on ever-broader powers for its own government. Furthermore, the highly touted "checks and balances" and "separation of powers" in the American government are flimsy indeed, since in the final analysis all of these divisions are part of the same government and are governed by the same set of rulers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/rothbard/newlibertywhole.asp Murray N. Rothbard, ''For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto''] (1978), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Islamic constitutionalism ==
The scope and limits of constitutionalism in Muslim countries have attracted growing interest in recent years. Authors such as Ann E. Mayer define Islamic constitutionalism as "constitutionalism that is in some form based on Islamic principles, as opposed to constitutionalism that has developed in countries that happen to be Muslim but that has not been informed by distinctively Islamic principles".&lt;ref&gt;Ann E. Mayer, Conundrums in Constitutionalism: Islamic Monarchies in an Era of Transition, 1 UCLA J. Islamic &amp; Near E.L. 183 (Spring / Summer, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the concrete meaning of the notion remains contested among Muslim as well as Western scholars. Influential thinkers like [[Mohammad Hashim Kamali]]&lt;ref&gt;Mohammad Hashim Kamali, Constitutionalism in Islamic Countries: A Contemporary Perspective of Islamic Law, in: Rainer Grote and Tilmann Röder (eds.), Constitutionalism in Islamic Countries: Between Upheaval and Continuity, Oxford University Press, Oxford/New York 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Khaled Abou El Fadl]],&lt;ref&gt;Khaled Abou El Fadl, Shariah and Constitutionalism in: Rainer Grote and Tilmann Röder (eds.), Constitutionalism in Islamic Countries: Between Upheaval and Continuity, Oxford University Press, Oxford/New York 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; but also younger ones like [[Asifa Quraishi]]&lt;ref&gt;Asifa Quraishi, The Separation of Powers in the Tradition of Muslim Governments, in: Rainer Grote and Tilmann Röder (eds.), Constitutionalism in Islamic Countries: Between Upheaval and Continuity, Oxford University Press, Oxford/New York 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nadirsyah Hosen]]&lt;ref&gt;Nadirsyah Hosen, "In search of Islamic Constitutionalism", ''American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences'', Volume 21, No. 2, 2004, 23 foll.&lt;/ref&gt; combine classic Islamic law with modern constitutionalism. The constitutional changes initiated by the Arab spring movement have already brought into reality many new hybrid models of Islamic constitutionalism.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. the monitoring project "Constitutional Reform in Arab Countries", http://www.mpil.de/red/crac{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''curfew bell''' was a bell rung in the evening in [[Medieval]] [[England]] as the [[curfew]] signal for everyone to go to bed.&lt;ref name ="peshall"&gt;Wood/Peshall, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

A bell was rung usually around eight o'clock in the evening which meant for them to cover their fires  - deaden or cover up, not necessarily put out altogether.&lt;ref name="Andrews228"&gt;Andrews, pp. 228-9&lt;/ref&gt; The usual procedure was at the sound of the curfew bell the burning logs were removed from the centre of the hearth of a warming fire and the hot ashes swept to the back and sides. The cold ashes were then raked back over the fire so as to cover it. The ashes would then keep smoldering giving warmth without a live fire going. The fire could easily be reignited the next morning by merely adding logs back on and allowing air to vent through the ashes. A benefit of covering up the fire in the evening was the prevention of destructive conflagrations caused by unattended live fires, a major concern since at the time most structures were made of wood and burned easily.&lt;ref name="Andrews228"/&gt; [[Voltaire]], in his ''Universal History'', notes the curfew bell acted as an ancient police on fire prevention in towns of the northern hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Andrews233"&gt;Andrews, p. 232-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The curfew bell with the associated [[curfew]] law is recorded by history as having been started by [[Alfred the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wood/Peshall, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; The law associated with the curfew bell is a [[Custom (law)|custom]] that history records as being adopted by [[William I of England]]&lt;ref name="Andrews228"/&gt; in the year 1068.&lt;ref&gt;Brand, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Andrews232"&gt;Andrews, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; The curfew law&lt;ref&gt;Wood/Peshall, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; imposed upon the people was a compulsory duty they had to do or be punished like a criminal.&lt;ref&gt;Brand, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; Historians, poets, and lawyers speak of the Medieval law associated with the curfew bell as being levelled mostly against the conquered [[Anglo-Saxons]]. It was initially used as a repressive measure by William I to prevent rebellious meetings of the conquered English. He prohibited the use of live fires after the curfew bell was rung to prevent associations and conspiracies. The strict practice of this [[medieval]] tradition was pretty much observed during the reign of King William I and [[William II of England]].&lt;ref name = "brand222"&gt;Brand, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;  The law was eventually repealed by [[Henry I of England]] in 1103.&lt;ref name="Andrews233b"&gt;Andrews, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

A century later in England the curfew bell was associated more with a time of night rather than an enforced curfew law. The curfew bell was in later centuries rung but just associated with a tradition.&lt;ref name = "brand222"/&gt; In Medieval times the ringing of the curfew bell was of such importance that land was occasionally paid for the service.&lt;ref name="Andrews236"&gt;Andrews, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Andrews238"&gt;Andrews, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; There are even recorded instances where the sound of the curfew bell sometimes saved the lives of lost travellers by safely guiding them back to town.&lt;ref name="Andrews238"/&gt;

In Macaulay's ''History of Claybrook'', [[Claybrooke Magna]], (1791), he says, "The custom of ringing curfew, which is still kept up in Claybrook, has probably obtained without intermission since the days of the Norman Conqueror."&lt;ref name = "brand223"&gt;Brand, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Articles for the Sexton of Faversham in England it was written of the curfew bell,
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Imprimis, the sexton, or his sufficient deputy, shall lye in the church steeple;
and at eight o'clock every night shall ring the curfew by the space of a quarter of an hour,
with such bell as of old time hath been accustomed.&lt;ref name = "brand222"/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The time of the curfew bell changed in later centuries after the Middle Ages to nine in the evening and sometimes even to ten.&lt;ref name="Andrews236"/&gt; To this day in many towns{{Where|date=February 2013}} there is a "curfew" at nine or ten that can be heard throughout the town, which is usually the town's emergency siren - sometimes used as the town's noon [[whistle]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Etymology==
[[Image:Couvre-feu utensil.jpg|thumb|''Couvre-feu'' utensil shield for putting out fireplace fires]]
The English word ''curfew'' is from old French ''carre-feu'' or ''cerre-feu''.&lt;ref name="Andrews228"/&gt; These initial French words later derived into ''couvre-feu''.&lt;ref name="Andrews228"/&gt; The word was again later turned into ''cover-feu'' in the [[Norman language]] after the conquering of the English.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these meant to cover the live flaming fire.&lt;ref name="Andrews228"/&gt; There was even a metal utensil cover known as the "couvre-feu", normally only found in houses of the well-to-do. It resembled a shield and was used to be put over the live fire when the curfew bell rang.&lt;ref name="Andrews228"/&gt; The curfew bell was known as ''ignitegium'' or ''peritegium bell'' in the medieval low Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daines Barrington]] shows that in an old Scottish poem published in 1770 the word curfew is written ''curphour''.&lt;ref name="Andrews236"/&gt;

== Poetry ==
The tyranny of William I is described by the poet [[Francis Thompson]],
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;The shiv'ring wretches, at the curfew sound,
Dejected sunk into their sordid beds,
And, through the mournful gloom of ancient times,
Mus'd sad, or dreamt of better.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

[[Chaucer]] writes on the curfew bell as just as a time, not a law:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;The dede slepe, for every besinesse,
Fell on this carpenter, right as I gesse,
About curfew time, or litel more.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

[[Shakespeare]] had unusual times for the curfew bell. In Romeo and Juliet, iv 4, he has Lord Capulet saying:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Come, stir, stir, stir, the second coch hath crow'd,
The curfew bell hath rung, tis three o'clock.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

In Tempest, v. 1, Prospero says:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;You, whose pastime'
Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice
To hear the solemn curfew.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

:In King Lear, iii. 4, Edgar speaks,
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;This is the foul fiend, Flibbertigibbet: he begins at curfew
and walks to the first clock.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

In the sixteenth century Bishop [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Joseph Hall]]'s "Fourth Satire" it reads:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Who ever gives a paire of velvet shooes
To th' Holy Rood, or liberally allowes,
But a new rope to ring the couvre-few bell,
But he desires that his great deed may dwell,
Or graven in the chancel window glasse,
Or in his lasting tombe of plated brasse.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

In the play ''[[The Merry Devil of Edmonton]]'' (published 1608), the curfew was at nine o'clock in the evening:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Well, 'tis nine a clocke, 'tis time to ring curfew&lt;/poem&gt;}}

[[John Milton]]'s put in his allegorical ''[[Il Penseroso]]'''s mouth the words:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Oft on a plat of rising ground,
I hear the far-off curfew sound,
Over some wide-water'd shore,
Swinging slow, with sullen roar...&lt;/poem&gt;}}

In Handel's ''[[L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato]]'' these words are accompanied by a [[pizzicato]] bass-line, representing a distant bell sound.


The most famous mention of the curfew in English poetry is in [[Thomas Gray]]'s [[Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard]] (1750), whose opening lines are:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,
         The lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea,
The ploughman homeward plods his weary way,
         And leaves the world to darkness and to me&lt;/poem&gt;}}


[[T. S. Eliot]] ''Gus the theater cat'' ("Old possum's book of practical cats")
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;When the curfew was rung, then I swung on the bell!&lt;/poem&gt;}}

In law and government, '''de jure''' ({{IPAc-en|d|eɪ|_|ˈ|dʒ|ʊər|i|,_|d|i|-}}; {{lang-la|de iure|lit=in law}} {{IPA-la|deː juːre}}) describes practices that are legally recognised, whether or not the practice exist in reality.&lt;ref name=Dictionary.cm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.Dictionary.com/browse/de-jure|title=de jure|publisher=Dictionary.com, LLC.|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, {{no wrap|''[[de facto]]''}} ("in fact" or "in practice") describes situations that exist in reality, even if not legally recognised.&lt;ref name="OxfordDF2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of 'de facto' adjective from the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary|url=http://www.OxfordLearnersDictionaries.com/definition/english/de-facto_2|publisher=Oxford University Press|website=OxfordLearnersDictionaries.com|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms are often used to contrast different scenarios: for a colloquial example, "I know that, de jure, this is supposed to be a parking lot, but now that the flood has left four feet of water here, it's a de facto swimming pool".&lt;ref name="WashULaw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal English: "De Facture/De Jure"|url=https://onlinelaw.wustl.edu/blog/legal-english-de-factode-jure/|publisher=Washington University School of Law|website=@WashULaw|date=28 December 2012|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To further explain, even if the signs around the flooded parking lot say "Parking Lot" (the signs effectively being the "law" determining what it is) it is "in fact" a swimming pool (with the water, the current practical circumstances, determining what it is).

==Examples==
It is possible to have multiple simultaneous conflicting (''de jure'') legalities, possibly none of which is in force (''de facto'').  After seizing power in 1526, [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] made his brother, [[Umar Din]], the lawful (''de jure'') [[Sultan]] of [[Adal Sultanate|Adal]].  Ahmad, however, was in practice (''de facto'') the actual Sultan, and his brother was a figurehead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aḥmad Grāñ - Somalian Muslim leader|url=https://www.Britannica.com/biography/Ahmad-Gran|work=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|publisher=Britannica.com|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1805 and 1914, the [[Muhammad Ali dynasty|ruling dynasty]] of [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egypt]] ruled as ''de jure'' [[viceroy]]s of the [[Ottoman Empire]], but acted as ''de facto'' independent rulers who maintained a [[polite fiction]] of Ottoman [[suzerainty]].  However, from about 1882, the rulers had only ''de jure'' rule over Egypt, as it had by then become a British [[puppet state]].  Thus, Egypt was by Ottoman law ''de jure'' a province of the Ottoman Empire, but ''de facto'' was part of the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cfJC1zLvBhQC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;ved=0ahUKEwijoK6thuzWAhXJExoKHTYvBTE4ChDoAQgnMAA&amp;q=veiled%20protectorate|title=The British in Egypt: Community, Crime and Crises 1882-1922|last=Mak|first=Lanver|date=2012-03-15|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9781848857094|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Law of the United States|American law]], particularly after ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954), the difference between ''de facto'' segregation (segregation that existed because of the voluntary associations and neighborhoods) and ''de jure'' segregation (segregation that existed because of local laws that mandated the segregation) became important distinctions for court-mandated remedial purposes.&lt;ref name="AndersonByrne2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Anderson|author2=Dara N.

A '''Delphinion''' (ancient Greek: Δελφίνιον) found in ancient Greece, was a temple of [[Apollo Delphinios]] ("Apollo of the womb") also known as "Delphic Apollo" or "Pythian Apollo", the principal god of [[Delphi]], who was regarded as the protector of ports and ships.

== The Delphinion at Miletus ==
The ruin of the Delphinion in [[Miletus]] is still mostly standing. A rectangular [[temenos]], the remains of the temple at the site date back to as early as the fifth century B.C.E.  Still present are a rectangular altar with volute [[Acroterion|acroteria]], as well as a few other round marble altars. An "annual Spring procession which went from Miletus to the Temple of Apollo at Didyma began at the Delphinion" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Miletus,%20Delphinion&amp;object=Building|title=Miletus, Delphinion (Building)|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inscriptions found on the walls of the Delphinion tell us the site also served as the city archive.

== The Delphinion at Athens ==
The Delphinion in [[Athens]] near the [[Acropolis]] contained a court of law, which was used to try [[homicide]] cases where the accused had claimed the defence of [[justifiable homicide]].

The '''doctrine of colourability''' is the idea that when a [[legislature]] wants to do something that it cannot do within the constraints of its [[government]]'s [[constitution]], it colours the law with a substitute purpose, allowing it to accomplish its original goal.

Under the [[constitution of India]],&lt;ref&gt;Book Titled "Land and the Constitution in India" has a chapter titled "Empire and Commonwealth Origins of the Doctrine of Colorability" page 209 and "Colorability" and Zamindari Abolition Laws" page 211&lt;/ref&gt; exclusive jurisdiction for the Union and the [[nation|State]] has been conferred regarding subject matters of [[legislation]]. This has been provided by Article 246,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vlex.in/vid/maganbhai-ishwarbhai-patel-union-and-29692323 |title=Case nº 1528 of Appeal, January 09, 1969 (case Maganbhai Ishwarbhai Patel VS.

As a consequence, conflicts of jurisdiction arise due to the fact there exist separate lists for the Union and the State to legislate upon. It often happens that strict constitutional boundaries are transgressed in legislation, inviting [[judicial review]] of the said [[Bill (law)|bill]]/[[act (law)|act]].

The [[Enactment of a bill|enactment of legislation]] is a function of the legislative power. In order to decide whether particular legislation is unconstitutional for breaching the constitutional limitations of [[Separation of powers|distribution of powers]], the Court examines the enactment with some [[strict scrutiny|strictness]]. The legislature can only make laws within its legislative competence. The legislative competence may be limited by specific List entries, or be restricted by other constitutional limitations and prohibitions. It cannot over-step the area of its legislative capability. A simple rule is followed in this regard, which is to find out if the legislating body had the power to legislate directly. If not, then the legislature cannot legislate indirectly. What it cannot do directly, it cannot attempt to do indirectly. Therefore, the substance of the legislation must be articulated for the purpose of determining whether what it enacted, it could really do. 

The question of colourable legislation was fully discussed by the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] in K.C. Gajapati Narayan Deo v. Orissa, a decision which has been treated as settling the [[law]] on the subject. This ruling was confirmed in the Supreme Court decision of Sonapur Tea Co. v. Deputy Commissioner.

'''''Domicilium citandi et executandi''''' is a [[Latin]] legal term meaning the address nominated by a party in a [[legal contract]] where legal notices may be sent; the onus usually being upon that party to notify the other signatory of any change in address, especially to be ready to receive any notice that is delivered to that address.

For instance, the delivery of a [[legal notice]] to the address of the ''domicilium citandi et executandi'' of a party to a contract can be considered legally sufficient for that notice to be considered received by that party, without the need for the person giving notice actually to find the person.

One or both parties to a contract may demand the other nominate a ''domicilium citandi et executandi'', typically in order to expedite later legal procedures relating to a contract by making it impossible for a party to claim that a legal notice was not received.

The literal translation from Latin into English is "house for summoning and upkeep".

The Latin term is commonly used within the [[legal jurisdiction]] of [[Zimbabwe]] and [[South Africa]].

'''Equipment Lease Agreements''' typically contain language prohibiting the lessee from assigning the [[lease]] to a third party.  For example, "You have no right to sell, transfer, assign, sublease, or encumber the equipment or this agreement" protects the Lessor’s [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]] and credit [[underwriting]] guidelines in the event the lessee ever wants to transfer the lease to another party.  However, it is possible to assign the lease, but the new party (assignee) will be subject to the lessor’s credit evaluation process and approval. Even if the assignee is approved, the existing lessee’s (assignor’s) personal guarantee(s), if any, might not be released unless the assignee’s credit stature is extremely strong.

An '''eternity clause''' in the [[constitution]] or [[basic law]] of a country is a clause intended to ensure that the law or constitution cannot be changed by amendment. Eternity clauses are a type of [[entrenched clause]] in the constitutions of the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic|Czech Republic]],&lt;ref name=CECEE/&gt; [[Constitution of Germany|Germany]], [[Constitution of Turkey|Turkey]], [[Constitution of Greece|Greece]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hellenicparliament.gr/UserFiles/f3c70a23-7696-49db-9148-f24dce6a27c8/001-156%20aggliko.pdf The official English language translation of the Greek Constitution as of May 27, 2008], Article 110 §1, p. 124, source: Hellenic Parliament, "The provisions of the Constitution shall be subject to revision with the exception of those which determine the form of government as a Parliamentary Republic and those of articles 2 paragraph 1, 4 paragraphs 1, 4 and 7 , 5 paragraphs 1 and 3, 13 paragraph 1, and 26."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constitution of Italy|Italy]],&lt;ref name=weakcon&gt;{{cite book|title=Weak Constitutionalism: Democratic Legitimacy and the Question of Constituent Power (Routledge Research in Constitutional Law|author=Joel Colón-Ríos|isbn=978-0415671903|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TqqQAzH2zxEC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ac5BHQMPUf&amp;sig=W94bSY1hO-OioXESL7MR08Hp_gI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8LVJUP-bAYnb0QXhuoDQCA|year=2012|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constitution of Morocco|Morocco]],&lt;ref name=EWC/&gt; [[Constitution of Iran|the Islamic Republic of Iran]], [[Constitution of Brazil|the Federative Republic of Brazil]] and [[Constitution of Norway|Norway]].&lt;ref name=weakcon/&gt;

The [[Constitution of India]] and the [[Constitution of Colombia]] contain similar provisions aimed at making it difficult, but not impossible, to change their basic structure.&lt;ref name=weakcon/&gt;

==Brazil==
Article 60 paragraph 4th of the [[Constitution of Brazil|Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil]], lists four subject areas of the Constitution that cannot be amended:&lt;ref&gt;[[:pt:Constituição brasileira de 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Federal form of the state; 
# direct, secret universal and periodic voting; 
# separation of powers; and 
# individual rights and guarantees.

There are other clauses that implicitly cannot be amended, mostly because they are dependent of the subjects above.

==Czech Republic==
The [[Czech Constitution]] contains an explicit eternity clause, whereby the [[Czech constitutional court]] assumes the role of ultimate arbiter of the effect of [[European law]] on the constitution.&lt;ref name=CECEE&gt;{{cite book|title=Constitutional Evolution in Central and Eastern Europe (Studies in Modern Law and Policy) |author=Kyriaki Topidi and Alexander H.E. Morawa|isbn=978-1409403272|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IhLKZKm7zGgC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6I3qdcCgv7&amp;sig=-N5b6wCU8dqfjiKGSAe1xWgxBmA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8LVJUP-bAYnb0QXhuoDQCA|year=2010|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
The German eternity clause (German: ''Ewigkeitsklausel'') is Article 79 paragraph (3) of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] (German: ''Grundgesetz''). The eternity clause establishes that certain fundamental principles of [[Germany]]'s democracy can never be removed, even by [[parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/304634/defending-german-democracy-andrew-stuttaford|title=Defending German Democracy|publisher=[[National Review]]|date=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental principles, (i.e., "the basic principles" of Articles 1 and 20), are as follows:

* '''Duty of all state authority''': "The dignity of man is inviolable. To respect and protect it is the duty of all state authority." Art. 1;
* '''Acknowledgement of human rights''': "The German people therefore acknowledge inviolable and inalienable human rights as the basis of every community, of peace and of justice in the world." Art. 1 Para. (2);
* '''Directly enforceable law''': "The following basic rights bind the legislature, the executive and judiciary as directly enforceable law." Art. 1 Para. (3);
* '''Republic''' (form of government): Art. 20 Para. (1);
* '''Federal state''' ''(Länder)'': Art. 20 Para. (1);
* '''Social state''' (welfare state): Art. 20 Para. (1);
* '''Sovereignty of the People''': "All state authority emanates from the People." Art. 20 Para. (2);
* '''Democratic''': "All state authority is exercised by the people by means of elections and voting and by specific legislative, executive and judicial organs." Art. 20 Para. (2);
* '''Rule of law''' (Rechtsstaat): "Legislation is subject to the constitutional order. The executive and judiciary are bound by the law." Art. 20 Para. (3);
* '''Separation of powers''': "Specific legislative, executive and judicial organs," each "bound by the law." Art. 20 Paras. (2) and (3).

The ''[[Parlamentarischer Rat]]'' (Parliamentary Council) included the eternity clause in its Basic Law specifically to prevent a new "legal" pathway to a dictatorship as was the case in the [[Weimar Republic]] with the [[Enabling Act of 1933]].&lt;ref name="iiea"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiea.com/publications/challenges-to-the-esm-treaty-and-the-fiscal-compact-treaty-before-the-german-constitutional-court|title=The Euro Crisis: Challenges to the ESM Treaty and the Fiscal Compact Treaty before the German Constitutional Court|publisher=[[Institute of International and European Affairs]]|date=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not possible for any political party, any legislation or any national commitment to violate "the basic principles" of "this Basic Law" laid down in Articles 1 and 20. Furthermore, the only way that Articles 1 and 20 can be removed is through Article 146, which requires "a constitution that is adopted by a free decision of the German People."&lt;ref name="iiea" /&gt;  So long as the principles of Articles 1 and 20 are retained, they may be amended (as Article 20 has indeed been amended to establish a 'right of resistance'), but the full protection of the eternity clause does not extend to such amendments.

Unlike the [[Weimar Constitution]], which made human rights only an objective, the eternity clause and Articles 1 and 20 make specific demands of "all state authority" regarding "human rights" (that is, "the basic rights" guaranteed in "this Basic Law") and have established specific [[Legislature|legislative]], [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[judicial]] organs in "the constitutional order" of "this Basic Law", each with separate functions bound by the [[law]]. These are "the basic principles" of the [[rule of law|democratic rule of law]] (German: ''[[Rechtsstaat]]'') and the [[separation of powers]], which are principles endorsed by three [[United Nations resolution]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/ruleoflaw/index.shtml|title=United Nations and the Rule of Law |publisher=Un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Vague|date=September 2018}}

==Greece==
The Greek eternity clause is Article 110 of the [[Constitution of Greece|Greek Constitution]]. This article states that every article of the [[Constitution of Greece|Constitution]] can be revised by the [[Hellenic Parliament|Parliament]], except of the fundemental ones, which establish [[Greece]] as a [[parliamentary republic]] and those of articles 2 paragraph 1, article 4 paragraphs 1, 4 and 7, article 5 paragraphs 1 and 3, article 13 paragraph 1 and article 26&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hellenicparliament.gr/UserFiles/f3c70a23-7696-49db-9148-f24dce6a27c8/001-156%20aggliko.pdf|title=Constitution of Greece in English|publisher= [[Hellenic Parliament]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These fundamental articles include:

* '''Republic''' (form of government): Art. 1 Para. (1);
* '''Sovereignty of the People''': "All state authority emanates from the People." Art. 1 Para. (2);
* '''Democratic''': "All state authority is exercised by the people, exist for the perople and the nation and are exercised as the Constitution suggests." Art. 1 Para. (3);
* '''Duty of all state authority''': "The dignity of man is inviolable. To respect and protect it is the duty of all state authority." Art. 2 Para. (1);
* '''Rule of law''': "Every Greek is equal to the law." Art. 4 Para. (1);
* '''About Public Function''': "Only Greek citizens are acceptable to all public functions, except of the exceptions in special laws." Art. 4 Para (4);
* '''About nobility titles''': "Noble or excellence titles are not given and not reconised on Greek citizens." Art. 4 Para (7);
* '''Acknowledgement of free personality''': "All people shall have the right to develop freely their personality and to participate in the social, economic and political life of the country, insofar as they do not infringe the rights of others or violate the Constitution and the good usages." Art. 5 Para (1);
* '''Personal Liberty''': "Personal liberty is inviolable. No one shall be prosecuted, arrested, imprisoned or otherwise confined except when and as the law provides." Art. 5 Para. (3);
* '''Freedom of Religion''': "Freedom of religious conscience is inviolable. The enjoyment of civil rights and liberties does not depend on the individual’s religious beliefs." Art. 13 Para. (1)
* '''Separation of powers''': "Specific legislative, executive and judicial organs," Art. 26;

==India==
The [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] has developed the [[basic structure doctrine]] which holds that certain features of the [[Constitution of India|constitution]] are fundamental in nature and cannot be modified through parliamentary amendment. The Supreme Court has yet to clearly delimit the components of the basic structure.

==Iran==
The final Article of the [[Constitution of Iran|Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran]], Art. 177, ensures that particular aspects of the Constitution are unalterable. These include the Islamic character of government and laws, the objectives of the republic, the democratic character of the government, “the absolute wilayat al-'amr and the leadership of the Ummah,” the administration of the country by referendum, and the official religion of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iranchamber.com/government/laws/constitution_ch13.php The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morocco==
In the [[Constitution of Morocco]], eternity clauses exist that ensure certain provisions cannot be amended, including the role of [[Islam]] in the nation's law, and the role of the [[List of rulers of Morocco|King of Morocco]] in law.&lt;ref name=EWC&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of World Constitutions|author=Gerhard Robbers|isbn=978-0816060788|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M3A-xgf1yM4C&amp;pg=PA626&amp;lpg=PA626&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YdnxLlYGpo&amp;sig=6JeZzSC2H1Ms2nzztB6w7F1N7H8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CLNJULKMOYXL0AWJ6YHICw|year=2006|page=626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1419">In modern U.S. usage, '''forfeiture''' is deprivation or destruction of a [[rights|right]] in consequence of the non-performance of some [[Obligation (law)|obligation]] or condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Connellan v. Federal Life &amp; Casualty Co.|vol=134|reporter=ME|opinion=104|date=1935}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be accidental, and therefore is distinguished from [[waiver]]; ''see [[waiver and forfeiture]].''  

Historically, forfeiture of a convict’s land and other assets followed on from conviction for certain serious offences (and thus resulted from criminal activity rather than from a failure to act).  A striking illustration of the practical effects of this rule is [[Giles Corey]]’s refusal to plead, in the [[Salem Witch Trials]], instead dying under ''[[peine forte et dure]]''.  By refusing to plead he avoided the jurisdiction of the court and thus avoided conviction and the consequent forfeiture of his estate.  Instead it passed to his sons.{{citation needed |date=November 2018}}

In the early 21st century, the [[United States Government]] began to seize [[domain name]]s, on the legal theory that they were property used in [[criminal activity|criminal activities]] and thus subject to forfeiture.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="942">'''Hard law''' refers to actual binding legal instruments and laws. In contrast with [[soft law]], hard law gives States and international actors actual binding responsibilities as well as rights. The term is common in [[international law]] where there are no sovereign governing bodies.

Hard law means binding laws. To constitute law, a rule, instrument or decision must be authoritative and prescriptive. In international law, hard law includes self-executing treaties or international agreements, as well as customary laws. These instruments result in legally enforceable commitments for countries (states) and other international subjects.

Group rights, also known as collective rights, are [[rights]] held by a group ''qua'' group rather than by its members severally;&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights-group/ |title=Group Rights (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date=2008-09-22 |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast, individual rights are rights held by [[Individuality|individual people]]; even if they are group-differentiated, which most rights are, they remain individual rights if the right-holders are the individuals themselves.&lt;ref name="Jones 2010"&gt;{{harvp|Jones|2010|p=39ss}}&lt;/ref&gt; Group rights have historically been used both to infringe upon and to facilitate individual rights, and the concept remains controversial.&lt;ref name="Bisaz 2012"&gt;{{harvp|Bisaz|2012|pp=7–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational group rights==
Besides the rights of groups based upon the immutable characteristics of their individual members, other group rights cater toward organizational persons, including nation-states, [[trade union]]s, [[corporation]]s, trade associations, chambers of commerce, [[political parties]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Such organizations are accorded rights which are particular to their specifically-stated functions and their capacities to speak on behalf of their members, i.e. the capacity of the corporation to speak to the government on behalf of all individual customers or employees or the capacity of the trade union to [[Collective bargaining|negotiate for benefits with employers on behalf of all workers in a company]].

==Philosophies==
In the political views of [[classical liberal]]s and some [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarians]], the role of the government is solely to identify, protect, and enforce the natural rights of the individual while attempting to assure just remedies for transgressions. Liberal governments that respect individual rights often provide for systemic controls that protect individual rights such as a system of [[due process]] in [[criminal justice]]. Proponents of this philosophy,  such as [[Jordan Peterson]], situate individual rights as in dialectical opposition to [[Collectivism|collective]] rights, suggesting that the two are mutually exclusive, and that philosophies and political theories that value collective rights do so at the expense of the individual and their rights. Peterson cites this sacrifice of the individual for the collective as reason to oppose left-wing ideologies, with particular reference to communism, alleging that "group rights are catastrophic"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=The Rational National|title=Jordan Peterson Claims ‘Group Rights’ Are Catastrophic|date=2018-05-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uhhsl5iI1DI|accessdate=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Critics of Peterson's reasoning suggest that his argument is based on a fallacious false-dichotomy that implies individual and group rights are mutually exclusive, separate and opposed; instead proposing that the two are inherently connected and require one another to ensure both are secured. Without certain collective rights, for example, a cardinal principle in international law, enshrined in Chapter I Article I of the [[United Nations Charter]], secures the right of "[[Self-determination]] of ''peoples''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-i/index.html|title=Charter of the United Nations, Chapter 1: Purposes &amp; Principles|last=|first=|date=|website=www.un.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without this group right, the ''people'' have no means or authority to assert the individual rights that self-determination enables the establishment of. If ''people'' are unable to determine their collective future, they are certainly unable to assert or ensure their individual rights, future and freedoms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2016/entries/rights-group/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Jones|first=Peter|date=2016|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to individual-collective dichotomy proposed by Peterson and contemporaries, critics suggest that both are necessarily connected and intertwined, rejecting the assertion that they exist in a mutually exclusive relationship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Ayn Rand]], developer of the philosophy of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], asserted that a group, as such, has no rights. She maintained that only an individual can possess rights, and therefore the expression "individual rights" is a redundancy, while the expression "collective rights" is a contradiction in terms. In this view, a person can neither acquire new rights by joining a group nor lose the rights which he does possess. Man can be in a group without want or the group minority, without rights. According to this philosophy, individual rights are not subject to a public vote, a majority has no right to vote away the rights of a minority, the political function of rights is precisely to protect minorities from the will of majorities, and the smallest minority on earth is the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individualrights.html |title=Individual Rights – Ayn Rand Lexicon |publisher=Aynrandlexicon.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand offers several unique perspectives on rights, holding that 1. ontologically, rights are neither attributes nor conventions but principles of morality, having, therefore, the same epistemic status as any other moral principle; 2. rights "define and sanction man's freedom of action,";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rand|1964|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; 3. as protectors of freedom of action, rights do not mean "entitlements" to be supplied with any goods or services;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rand|1964|pp=110, 113–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4. "Man's rights can be violated only by the use of physical force. It is only by means of physical force that one man can deprive another of his life, or enslave him, or rob him, or prevent him from pursuing his own goals, or compel him to act against his own rational judgment."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rand|1964|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 5. rights derive from the mind's needs: for an organism that survives by means of reason, freedom is a survival-requirement:initiated force negates or paralyzes the thinking mind. Rand's overall argument is that rights protect freedom in order to protect reason. "Force and mind are opposites."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rand|1957|p=1023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adam Smith]], in 1776 in his book [[The Wealth of Nations|''An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations'']], describes the right of each successive generation, as a group, collectively, to the earth and all the earth possesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Stewart|1811|pp=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Declaration of Independence|''Declaration of Independence'']] states several group, or collective, rights of the people as well as the states, for example the Right of the People: "whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it" and the right of  the States: "... as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2841">The '''International Institute for the Sociology of Law (IISL)''' in [[Oñati]] is the only international establishment  which is entirely devoted to teaching and promoting the [[sociology of law]], [[Sociology of law|socio-legal studies]], and [[Sociology of law|law and society]] research.

The IISL is a joint venture of the [http://rcsl.iscte.pt/ Research Committee on Sociology of Law] (also known as RC12 of the International Sociological Association) and the government of the Basque autonomous region in Spain. It is situated (since 1989) in the [[University of Oñati]] (the Ancient University of the Basque Country) in Oñati. The founding director of the IISL, André-Jean Arnaud, had bronze plaques put on the walls of the renaissance building with the names of some of the forefathers of modern sociology of law: [[Montesquieu]], [[Henry James Sumner Maine]], [[Francisco Giner de los Ríos]], [[Henri Lévy-Bruhl]], [[Achille Loria]], [[Leon Petrażycki]], [[Émile Durkheim]], [[Max Weber]], [[Eugen Ehrlich]], [[Karl Renner]], [[Karl N. Llewellyn]], [[Theodor Geiger]], [[Georges Gurvitch]], [[Nicholas Timasheff|Nicholas S. Timasheff]].

The IISL has four "official languages": [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Basque language|Basque]]. It houses a famous library/documentation centre covering socio-legal literature in all major and many minor languages. The Institute organises socio-legal workshops and an international Master's Program in the Sociology of Law, including student scholarships. Publications from the workshops are regularly produced in both an English- and Spanish language series, including the Institute's own online peer-reviewed journal (Onati Socio-Legal Series). The IISL is also the host of the World Consortium of Law and Society associations. Applications to host a workshop, residence grants for visitors wishing to use the library, and to study on the Masters programmes are usually due mid-February.

==Academic Background==
In 1976 Jawahir Thontowi graduated from the one of the first Education for Islamic Judges in Indonesia established in Yogyakarta. This was a school which will become of the pioneers of legal practitioners in Indonesia. As an example the head of the Constitution Court in Indonesia Mahfud MD is an alumnus.

Between 1978 and 1979 became the president of the Student Representative Council in The law faculty UII and at the same time the Vice director of the Human Right Commission which was later turned into the Legal Aid Institute in Yogyakarta.  In 1979-1980 become the Secretary General for Student Government Council UII then became the staff member of the community development in Muslim students association Yogyakarta.  During these years he has become a prominent activist in the campus which builds the foundation of his organization skills in later life.

In 1981 he received an LLB Degree from the Faculty of Law Universitas Islam Indonesia. Then in 1984 became the Head of Community Development Division Institute for Research and Community at the Universitas Islam Indonesia.  Then in 1986 took a course in Center for Research Training of Social Science, Universitas Hasanudin. In August that year he received an Award for an outstanding field research Stunent given by YIIS and PLPIIS in Jakarta. Working in the campus and research would then lead to further development in his academic career and an opportunity to attain higher education in Australia. This was a turning point that would excel in academic career.

In 1990 he started a preliminary Masters of Arts at the Anthology Department of UWA . Then in 1992 receive a research grant for the post graduate students from the University of Western Australia.  In 1998 finally completed his Ph.D Degree in the University of Western Australia.  He was ready to go back to Indonesia to implement his knowledge and skill in an Indonesia context, especially going back to campus to teach again. 
Upon return from Australia and going back to Indonesia holding a Ph.D he was appoint Head of the International Department for 3 years in 1999-2001. During this time he was focusing on building and improving the law faculty and made it more dynamic. He pas the team leader in various initiatives conducted by the campus such Designing University Joint Collaboration and development then Establishing the Doctorate Program in Law Faculty University.  This was a major breakthrough for UII having established a Doctorate program in the field of Law.

September 2000 he became the Director of the Doctorate Program law faculty.  In September the next year in 2001 he made an initiative to make the International Program for Law in the campus which took a one-year process. For the Law faculty he made two important contributions that are the establishment of the Doctorate program and the second the International program. March that year he was elected to become the Dean of the Law Faculty until 2006.

In 2006 the election for the Rector of UII He participated in first direct election for the position being the fourth rank,  Edy Suandi Hamid having 284.5 votes,  Amir Mu’alim 92 votes, Luthfi Hasan, 87.5 votes.  Eddy Suandi Hamid came out as winner to lead the campus.  The next election for the position as the Vice Rector I to be in charge of academics it was between Jawahir Thontowi and Sarwidi which was a very close election and Sarwidi manages to be elected for the position having 309,5 votes compared to only 298,5 votes. Supporters of Jawahir Thontowi in campus still remain strong.

In 2010 election Jawahir Thontowi became in the running for the peak positions in campus again. Still competing versus Edy Suandi Hamid and Sarwidi,  the election process was very tight Edy Suandi Hamid with only 32 votes, Jawahir Thontowi 31 votes and Sarwidi 25 votes.  Interesting that in 2006 elections he lost to Sarwidi for the position but now in the 2010 he has more votes.

After losing from the selection process, he came back to the law faculty to continue to teach, practice what he has learned and implement his understanding about the law in Indonesia. This experience will be the foundations of the position in the future for the next election process in 2014 to become the rector of campus. To have the highest academic career in UII starting as a student activist, then becoming a researcher and lecturer, then become the dean of the law faculty and hope the next position becoming the rector.

Notably, 25 countries, all of which being developed democracies or developing democracies, recognized [[same-sex marriage]] as of 2018. By contrast, 10 countries or jurisdictions, all of which are Islamic and ruled by [[sharia]], were imposing the [[death penalty for homosexuality]].

In 2011, the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] passed its first resolution recognizing LGBT rights, following which the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] issued a report documenting violations of the rights of LGBT people, including [[hate crime]]s, criminalization of [[homosexuality|homosexual activity]], and [[discrimination]]. Following the issuance of the report, the [[United Nations]] urged all countries which had not yet done so to enact laws protecting basic LGBT rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.N. council passes gay rights resolution|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/06/17/un.lgbt.rights/index.html|publisher=[[CNN]]|author=Jill Dougherty|date=June 17, 2011|accessdate=September 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN issues first report on human rights of gay and lesbian people|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40743|publisher=[[United Nations]]|date=December 15, 2011|accessdate=September 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Celts===
According to [[Aristotle]], although most "belligerent nations" were strongly influenced by their women, the Celts were unusual because their men openly preferred male lovers (''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' II 1269b).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Percy |first=William A. |title=Pederasty and Pedagogy in Archaic Greece |publisher=University of Illinois Press |year=1996 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=TCvoj1efp8UC&amp;pg=PA18 |page=18 |isbn=0-252-06740-1 |accessdate=2009-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rankin"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rankin |first1=David |last2=Ranking |first2=H.D. |title=Celts and the Classical World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fdqk4vXqntgC&amp;pg=PA55 |publisher=Psychology Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-4151-5090-3 |pages=55 and 78 }}&lt;/ref&gt; H. D. Rankin in ''Celts and the Classical World'' notes that "Athenaeus echoes this comment (603a) and so does [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]] (30.9). It seems to be the general opinion of antiquity."&lt;ref name="Rankin"/&gt; In book XIII of his ''[[Deipnosophistae|Deipnosophists]]'', the Roman Greek rhetorician and grammarian [[Athenaeus]], repeating assertions made by [[Diodorus Siculus]] in the 1st century BC (''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' 5:32), wrote that Celtic women were beautiful but that the men preferred to sleep together. Diodorus went further, stating that "the young men will offer themselves to strangers and are insulted if the offer is refused". Rankin argues that the ultimate source of these assertions is likely to be [[Poseidonius]] and speculates that these authors may be recording "some kind of bonding ritual ... which requires abstinence from women at certain times".&lt;ref name="Rankin"/&gt;

===Ancient India===
Throughout [[Hindu]] and [[Vedic]] texts there are many descriptions of saints, demigods, and even the Supreme Lord transcending gender norms and manifesting multiple combinations of sex and gender.&lt;ref&gt;ritiya-Prakriti: People of the Third Sex, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; There are several instances in ancient   [[Indian epic poetry]] of same sex depictions and unions by gods and goddesses. There are several stories depicting love between those of the same sex, especially among kings and queens. [[Kamasutra]], the ancient [[Ancient India|Indian]] treatise on love talks about feelings for same sexes. [[Transsexuals]] are also venerated e.g. [[Lord Vishnu]] as [[Mohini]] and [[Lord Shiva]] as [[Ardhanarishwara]] (which means half woman).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://galva108.org/deities.html |title=Gay and Lesbian Vaishnava Association, Inc |publisher=[[The Gay and Lesbian Vaishnava Association]] |accessdate=2013-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023063544/http://galva108.org/deities.html |archivedate=23 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient West Asia===

====Ancient Israel====
The ancient [[Law of Moses]] (the [[Torah]]) forbids men lying with men (intercourse) in Leviticus 18 and gives a story of attempted homosexual rape in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] in the story of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], the cities being soon destroyed after that. The death penalty was prescribed. In Deuteronomy 22:5, cross-dressing is condemned as being "abominable".

====Ancient Persia====
In Persia homosexuality and homoerotic expressions were tolerated in numerous public places, from monasteries and seminaries to taverns, military camps, bathhouses, and coffee houses. In the early [[Safavids|Safavid]] era (1501–1723), male houses of [[prostitution]] (''amrad khane'') were legally recognized and paid taxes. Persian poets, such as [[Saadi (poet)|Sa'di]] (d. 1291), [[Hafiz Shirazi|Hafiz]] (d. 1389), and [[Jami]] (d. 1492), wrote poems replete with homoerotic allusions. The two most commonly documented forms were commercial sex with transgender young males or males enacting transgender roles exemplified by the [[köçek]]s and [[Sufi]] spiritual practices in which the practitioner admired the form of a beautiful boy in order to enter ecstatic states and glimpse the beauty of God.

====Assyria====
In [[Assyria]]n society, [[sex crime]]s were punished identically whether they were homosexual or heterosexual.&lt;ref name="Nissinen"&gt;Homoeroticism in the Biblical World: A Historical Perspective, by Martti Nissinen, Fortress Press, 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-sHSNPG85tUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage p. 24–28]&lt;/ref&gt; An individual faced no punishment for penetrating someone of equal [[social class]], a cult prostitute, or with someone whose [[gender role]]s were not considered solidly masculine.&lt;ref name="Nissinen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Origins and Role of Same-Sex Relations in Human Societies, by James Neill, McFarland, 27 Oct 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=1ha9GgWNmy0C&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;pg=PA83#v=onepage p.83]&lt;/ref&gt; Such sexual relations were even seen as good [[Luck|fortune]], with an [[Akkadian literature|Akkadian tablet]], the ''[[Šumma ālu]]'', reading, "If a man copulates with his equal from the rear, he becomes the leader among his peers and brothers".&lt;ref name="Greenberg"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RKhFRgR-1awC&amp;q=equal+basis#v=onepage ''The Construction of Homosexuality'', authored by David Greenberg, University of Chicago Press, 1990]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epistle.us/hbarticles/neareast.html|title=Homosexuality in the Ancient Near East, beyond Egypt by Bruce Gerig    in the Ancient Near East, beyond Egypt|website=epistle.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, homosexual relationships with fellow soldiers, slaves, royal attendants, or those where a social better was [[Top, bottom and versatile|submissive or penetrated]], were treated as bad [[omens]].&lt;ref&gt;Pritchard, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gay Rights Or Wrongs: A Christian's Guide to Homosexual Issues and Ministry, by Mike Mazzalonga, 1996, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

Middle Assyrian [[Assyrian law|Law Codes]] dating 1075 BC has a particularly harsh law for [[Sexual orientation and military service|homosexuality in the military]], which reads: "If a man have intercourse with his brother-in-arms, they shall turn him into a eunuch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Halsall|first1=Paul|title=The Code of the Assura|url=https://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/1075assyriancode.asp|website=[[Internet History Sourcebooks Project]]|accessdate=16 November 2015|publisher=[[Fordham University]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911230918/http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/1075assyriancode.asp|archivedate=11 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Homosexuality, Erik Holland page 334"&gt;The Nature Of Homosexuality, Erik Holland, page 334, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gRjGApZVwPIC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;q=Code%20of%20the%20Assura%20homosexulaity|title=Tritiya-Prakriti: People of the Third Sex|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar law code reads, "If a seignior lay with his neighbor, when they have prosecuted him (and) convicted him, they shall lie with him (and) turn him into a [[eunuch]]". This law code condemns a situation that involves homosexual [[rape]]. Any Assyrian male could visit a [[prostitute]] or lie with another male, just as long as false rumors or forced sex were not involved with another male.&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Driver and J. C. Miles, The Assyrian Laws (Oxford, Clarendon Press [1935]), 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Rome===
The "conquest mentality" of the [[ancient Romans]] shaped [[Homosexuality in ancient Rome|Roman homosexual practices]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eva Cantarella]], ''Bisexuality in the Ancient World'' (Yale University Press, 1992, 2002, originally published 1988 in Italian), p. xi; Marilyn B. Skinner, introduction to ''Roman Sexualities'' (Princeton University Press, 1997), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Roman Republic]], a [[Roman citizenship|citizen]]'s political liberty was defined in part by the right to preserve his body from physical compulsion or use by others;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; for the male citizen to submit his body to the giving of pleasure was considered servile.&lt;ref&gt;Catharine Edwards, "Unspeakable Professions: Public Performance and Prostitution in Ancient Rome," in ''Roman Sexualities'', pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt; As long as a man played the penetrative role, it was socially acceptable and considered natural for him to have [[Pathicus|same-sex relations]], without a perceived loss of his [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Male sexuality|masculinity or social standing]].&lt;ref&gt;Amy Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus: Sexuality and Aggression in Roman Humor'' (Oxford University Press, 1983, 1992), p. 225, and "Not before Homosexuality: The Materiality of the ''cinaedus'' and the Roman Law against Love between Men," ''Journal of the History of Sexuality'' 3.4 (1993), p. 525.&lt;/ref&gt; The bodies of citizen youths were strictly off-limits, and the ''[[Lex Scantinia]]'' imposed penalties on those who committed a sex crime ''([[stuprum]])'' against a [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sexuality and children|freeborn male minor]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Moralia'' 288a; Thomas Habinek, "The Invention of Sexuality in the World-City of Rome," in ''The Roman Cultural Revolution'' (Cambridge University Press, 1997), p. 39; Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," pp. 545–546. Scholars disagree as to whether the ''Lex Scantinia'' imposed the death penalty or a hefty fine.&lt;/ref&gt; Acceptable same-sex partners were males excluded from legal protections as citizens: [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]], male [[Prostitution in ancient Rome|prostitutes]], and the ''[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Pleasure and infamy|infames]]'', entertainers or others who might be technically free but whose lifestyles set them outside the law.

"Homosexual" and "heterosexual" were thus not categories of [[Sexuality in ancient Rome|Roman sexuality]], and no words exist in [[Latin]] that would precisely translate these concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'' (Oxford University Press, 1999, 2010), p. 304, citing Saara Lilja, ''Homosexuality in Republican and Augustan Rome'' (Societas Scientiarum Fennica, 1983), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; A male citizen who willingly performed [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Os impurum|oral sex]] or received [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Anal sex|anal sex]] was disparaged, but there is only limited evidence of legal penalties against these men, who were presumably "homosexual" in the modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', pp. 214–215; Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; In courtroom and political rhetoric, charges of [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Effeminacy and transvestism|effeminacy]] and passive sexual behaviors were directed particularly at "democratic" politicians ''([[populares]])'' such as [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Mark Antony]].&lt;ref&gt;Catharine Edwards, ''The Politics of Immorality in Ancient Rome'' (Cambridge University Press, 1993), pp. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman law]] addressed the [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#The rape of men|rape of a male citizen]] as early as the 2nd century BC, when a ruling was issued in a case that may have involved a man of same-sex orientation. It was ruled that even a man who was "disreputable and questionable" had the same right as other citizens not to have his body subjected to forced sex.&lt;ref&gt;As recorded in a fragment of the speech ''De Re Floria'' by [[Cato the Elder]] (frg. 57 Jordan = [[Aulus Gellius]] 9.12.7), noted and discussed by Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt; A law probably dating to the [[Roman dictator|dictatorship]] of Julius Caesar defined rape as forced sex against "boy, woman, or anyone"; the rapist was subject to execution, a rare penalty in Roman law.&lt;ref&gt;Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," pp. 562–563. See also ''Digest'' 48.5.35 [34] on legal definitions of rape that included boys.&lt;/ref&gt; A male classified as ''infamis'', such as a prostitute or actor, could not as a matter of law be raped, nor could a slave, who was legally classified as property; the slave's owner, however, could prosecute the rapist for property damage.&lt;ref&gt;Under the ''[[Lex Aquilia]]''. See McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality, and the Law in Ancient Rome'', p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman army]] of the Republic, [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sex in the military|sex among fellow soldiers]] violated the decorum against intercourse with citizens and was subject to harsh penalties, including death,&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'', p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; as a violation of [[military discipline]].&lt;ref&gt;Sara Elise Phang, ''Roman Military Service: Ideologies of Discipline in the Late Republic and Early Principate'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek historian [[Polybius]] (2nd century BC) lists [[desertion|deserters]], thieves, [[perjury|perjurers]], and "those who in youth have abused their persons" as subject to the ''[[fustuarium]]'', clubbing to death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Polybius]], ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|Histories]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/6*.html#37 6.37.9] (translated as [[bastinado]]).&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient sources are most concerned with the effects of [[sexual harassment]] by officers, but the young soldier who brought an accusation against his superior needed to show that he had not willingly taken the passive role or prostituted himself.&lt;ref&gt;Phang, ''The Marriage of Roman Soldiers'', pp. 280–285.&lt;/ref&gt; Soldiers were free to have [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Master-slave relations|relations with their male slaves]];&lt;ref&gt;Phang, ''The Marriage of Roman Soldiers'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; the use of a fellow citizen-soldier's body was prohibited, not homosexual behaviors per se.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 112 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; By the late Republic and throughout the [[Roman Empire|Imperial period]], there is increasing evidence that men whose lifestyle marked them as "homosexual" in the modern sense served openly.&lt;ref&gt;Phang, ''The Marriage of Roman Soldiers'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=jyFdUxqYZ48C&amp;pg=PA285#v=onepage&amp;q=%22more%20tolerant%20of%20homosexual%20relations%20between%20soldiers%22 pp. 285–292.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Roman law did not recognize marriage between men, and in general Romans regarded marriage as a heterosexual union with the primary purpose of producing children, in the early Imperial period some male couples were celebrating [[Marriage in ancient Rome|traditional marriage rites]]. [[Juvenal]] remarks with disapproval that his friends often attended such ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Juvenal, ''Satire'' 2; Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor [[Nero]] had two marriages to men, once as the bride (with a [[freedman]] [[Pythagoras (freedman)|Pythagoras]]) and once as the groom. His consort [[Sporus]] appeared in public as Nero's wife wearing the regalia that was customary for the Roman empress.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]] ''Life of Nero'' 28–29; Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 279ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from measures to protect the prerogatives of citizens, the prosecution of homosexuality as a general crime began in the 3rd century of the Christian era when male prostitution was banned by [[Philip the Arab]]. By the end of the 4th century, after the [[Roman Empire]] had come under [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Christian rule]], passive homosexuality was [[Death by burning|punishable by burning]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Groneberg, "Reasons for Homophobia: Three Types of Explanation," in ''Combatting Homophobia: Experiences and Analyses Pertinent to Education'' (LIT Verlag, 2011), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; "Death by sword" was the punishment for a "man coupling like a woman" under the [[Theodosian Code]].&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Theodosianus'' 9.7.3 (4 December 342), introduced by the sons of Constantine in 342.&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Justinian]], all same-sex acts, passive or active, no matter who the partners, were declared contrary to nature and punishable by death.&lt;ref&gt;Groneberg, "Reasons for Homophobia," p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Congo ===
[[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]] recorded that in the past male [[Azande]] warriors in the northern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] routinely took on young male lovers between the ages of twelve and twenty, who helped with household tasks and participated in [[intercrural sex]] with their older husbands. The practice had died out by the early 20th century, after Europeans had gained control of African countries, but was recounted to Evans-Pritchard by the elders to whom he spoke.&lt;ref name=evanspritchard&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Evans-Pritchard | first1 = E.

=== Feudal Japan ===
In feudal [[Japan]], homosexuality was recognized, between equals (bi-do), in terms of [[pederasty]] (wakashudo), and in terms of prostitution. The younger partner in a pederastic relationship often was expected to make the first move; the opposite was true in ancient Greece. In religious circles, same-sex love spread to the warrior ([[samurai]]) class, where it was customary for a boy in the ''[[wakashū]]'' age category to undergo training in the martial arts by apprenticing to a more experienced adult man. The man was permitted, if the boy agreed, to take the boy as his lover until he came of age; this relationship, often formalized in a "brotherhood contract",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leupp |first=Gary P. |title=Male Colors: The Construction of Homosexuality in Tokugawa Japan |publisher=University of California Press |year=1999 |pages=53–54 |isbn=0-520-20909-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a6q-PqPDAmIC&amp;pg=PA53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was expected to be exclusive, with both partners swearing to take no other (male) lovers. The [[Samurai]] period was one in which homosexuality was seen as particularly positive. Later when Japanese society became pacified, the middle classes adopted many of the practices of the warrior class.

=== Lesotho ===
Anthropologists [[Stephen O. Murray|Stephen Murray]] and [[Will Roscoe]] reported that women in [[Lesotho]] engaged in socially sanctioned "long term, erotic relationships" called ''[[motsoalle]].''&lt;ref name=murrayroscoe&gt;{{Cite book|title=Boy Wives and Female Husbands: Studies of African Homosexualities |last=Murray |first=Stephen (ed.) |authorlink=Stephen O.

=== Papua New Guinea ===
In [[Papua New Guinea]], same-sex relationships were an integral part of the culture of certain tribes until the middle of the last century. The [[Etoro tribe|Etoro]] and [[Marind-anim]] for example, even viewed heterosexuality as wasteful and celebrated homosexuality instead. They believed that in sharing semen, they are sharing their life force, yet women simply wasted this force any time they didn't get pregnant after sex. In many traditional Melanesian cultures a prepubertal boy would be paired with an older adolescent who would become his mentor and who would "inseminate" him (orally, anally, or topically, depending on the tribe) over a number of years in order for the younger to also reach puberty.&lt;ref name=melanesia&gt;{{citation |title=Ritualized Homosexuality in Melanesia |first=Gilbert H. |last=Herdt |year=1984 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-08096-3 |pages=128–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;During [[World War II]], [[Nazi Germany]] annexed territory or established [[reichskommissariat]]s which extended [[Paragraph 175|Germany's laws against same-sex sexual intercourse]] to those territories and reichskommissariats. Age of consent was previously equalized for same-sex couples in the following countries or territories before German annexation or establishment of reichskommissariats: [[Province of Belluno|Belluno]] ([[LGBT rights in Italy|legal in 1890]]), [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] ([[LGBT rights in Italy|legal in 1890]]), [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] ([[LGBT rights in Poland|legal in 1932]]), and [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]] ([[LGBT rights in Italy|legal in 1890]]). All countries and territories listed that where annexed or established into reichskommissariats by Nazi Germany during World War II where restored as independent countries or reincorporated into their previous countries during or after the war and thus re-legalized equal age of consent laws for same-sex couples in those areas.]]&lt;/div&gt;

In [[Protestant]] [[Christianity]], the relationship between '''Law and Gospel'''&amp;mdash;[[Divine Law|God's Law]] and the [[Gospel]] of [[Jesus Christ]]&amp;mdash;is a major topic in [[Lutheran]] and [[Reformed]] theology. In these religious [[tradition]]s, the distinction between the doctrines of Law, which demands obedience to God's [[ethic]]al will, and Gospel, which promises the [[forgiveness]] of [[sin]]s in light of the person and work of [[Jesus Christ]], is critical. Ministers use it as a [[hermeneutical]] principle of biblical interpretation and as a guiding principle in [[homiletics]] (sermon composition) and [[pastoral care]]. It involves the [[supersessionism|supersession]] of the [[Old Covenant]] (including traditional Jewish law, or [[halakha]]) by the [[New Covenant]] and [[Christian theology]].

Other Christian groups have a view on the issue as well, or more generally [[Christian views on the old covenant|views of the Old Covenant]], though the matter has not usually been as hotly debated or rigorously defined as in the [[Lutheran]] and [[Reformed]] traditions.

Sometimes the issue is discussed under the headings of "[[Biblical law in Christianity|Law]] and [[Divine grace|Grace]]", "[[Sin]] and Grace", "[[Letter and spirit of the law|Spirit and Letter]]", and "ministry ({{lang|grc|διακονíα}}, ''diakonia'') of death/condemnation" and "ministry of the Spirit/[[righteousness]]".&lt;ref name="Bible1"&gt;
[[s:Bible, King James, 2 Corinthians#Chapter 3|2 Cor. 3:6-9]].
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lutheran view==

===Martin Luther and Lutheran theologians===
A specific formulation of the distinction of Law and Gospel was first brought to the attention of the Christian Church by [[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546), and laid down as the foundation of evangelical [[Lutheran]] biblical exegesis and exposition in Article 4 of the ''[[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]]'' (1531): "All Scripture ought to be distributed into these two principal topics, the Law and the promises. For in some places it presents the Law, and in others the promise concerning Christ, namely, either when [in the [[Old Testament]]] it promises that Christ will come, and offers, for His sake, the remission of sins, justification, and life eternal, or when, in the Gospel [in the [[New Testament]]], Christ Himself, since He has appeared, promises the remission of sins, justification, and life eternal.".&lt;ref name="BOC1"&gt;F. Bente and W.H.T. Dau, ed. and trans. &lt;cite&gt;Triglot Concordia: The Symbolical Books of the Evangelical Lutheran Church&lt;/cite&gt;, (St. Louis: [[Concordia Publishing House]], 1921), Apology IV (II).5, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Formula of Concord]] likewise affirmed this distinction in Article V, where it states: "We believe, teach, and confess that the distinction between the Law and the Gospel is to be maintained in the Church with great diligence..."&lt;ref name="BOC2"&gt;''Triglot Concordia'', FC Epitome V, (II).1, p. 503ff&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Luther]] wrote: "Hence, whoever knows well this art of distinguishing between Law and Gospel, him place at the head and call him a doctor of Holy Scripture."&lt;ref name="doctor"&gt;Martin Luther, ''Dr. Martin Luthers Sämmtliche Schriften'', St. Louis ed. (St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, N.D.), vol. 9, col. 802.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the [[Lutheran Orthodoxy|Lutheran Age of Orthodoxy]] (1580–1713) this hermeneutical discipline was considered foundational and important by Lutheran theologians.

This distinction was the first article in ''Patrick`s Places'' (1528) by [[Patrick Hamilton (martyr)|Patrick Hamilton]].&lt;ref name="PP"&gt;&lt;cite&gt;''Patrick`s Places'' (1528)&lt;/cite&gt;[http://www.thereformation.info/patricks%20places.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[C.F.W. Walther|Carl Ferdinand Wilhelm Walther]] (1811–1887), who was the first (and third) president of the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]], renewed interest in and attention to this theological skill in his evening lectures at Concordia Seminary, St. Louis 1884-85.&lt;ref name="dau"&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Proper Distinction Between Law and Gospel: 39 Evening Lectures&lt;/cite&gt;, W.H.T. Dau tr., 1897.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book of Concord===
The [[Formula of Concord]] distinguished three uses, or purposes, in the Law in Article VI. It states: "[T]he Law was given to men for three reasons ..."

#that "thereby outward discipline might be maintained against wild, disobedient men [and that wild and intractable men might be restrained, as though by certain bars]"
#that "men thereby may be led to the knowledge of their sins"
#that "after they are regenerate ... they might ... have a fixed rule according to which they are to regulate and direct their whole life"&lt;ref name="BOC3"&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Triglot Concordia&lt;/cite&gt;, ''Formula of Concord'', Epitome VI.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary concern was to maintain that the Law should continue to be used by Christians after they had been [[Regeneration (theology)|regenerated]] by the Holy Spirit through the Gospel to counter the doctrine of [[Johannes Agricola]], who taught that the [[Antinomianism#First Antinomian controversy|Law was no longer needed]] by regenerate Christians."&lt;ref name="BOC3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. Bente, ''Historical Introductions to the Symbolical Books of the Evangelical Lutheran Church'', chapter XVII: The Antinomistic Controversy, (St. Louis, MO: CPH, 1921), 161-172, cf. p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Confessional Lutheranism]] teaches that the Law cannot be used to deny the Gospel, neither can the Gospel be used to deny God's Law.&lt;ref name=WLS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BuchholzJustification.pdf |title=Jesus canceled your debt! |last1=Bichholz |first1=Jon D. |publisher=Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary |quote=We embrace a parallel principle in our division of God’s word into law and gospel.

The three ''uses'' of the Law are:

#''Curb'' -  Through fear of punishment, the Law keeps the sinful nature of both Christians and non-Christians under check. This does not stop sin, since the sin is already committed when the heart desires to do what is wrong, yet it does stop the open outbreak of sin that will do even further damage.
#''Mirror'' - The Law serves as a perfect reflection of what God created the human heart and life to be. It shows anyone who compares his/her life to God's requirement for perfection that he/she is sinful.
#''Guide'' - This use of the law that applies only to Christians. The law becomes the believer's helper. Empowered by the gospel truth of forgiveness and righteousness in Christ, the believer's new self eagerly desires to live to please the Triune God.&lt;ref name=WELS-USES&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=46&amp;cuItem_itemID=21778 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080401021937/https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=46&amp;cuItem_itemID=21778 |dead-url=yes |archive-date= 1 April 2008 |work=WELS Topical Q&amp;A |title=Uses Of The Law |publisher=[[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] |accessdate=29 Jan 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WELS-3RD&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=46&amp;cuItem_itemID=6414 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080102114247/https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=46&amp;cuItem_itemID=6414 |dead-url=yes |archive-date= 2 January 2008 |work=WELS Topical Q&amp;A |title=Third use of the Law |publisher=[[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] |accessdate=29 Jan 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reformed view==
[[File:Cranach Gesetz und Gnade Gotha.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Law and Gospel (Cranach)|Law and Gospel]]'', by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], a Lutheran. The left side of the tree illustrates law, while the right side illustrates grace.]]

The distinction between law and gospel is a standard formulation in [[Reformed]] theology, though in recent years some have characterized it as distinctively Lutheran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horton|first=Michael|title=The Distinction between Law and Gospel in Reformed Faith and Practice|volume=19|issue=5|pages=12–14|url=http://www.modernreformation.org/default.php?page=articledisplay&amp;var1=ArtRead&amp;var2=1164&amp;var3=main|work=Modern Reformation|accessdate=19 November 2012|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zacharias Ursinus]] sharply distinguished the law and gospel as "the chief and general divisions of the holy scriptures" in his commentary on the [[Heidelberg Catechism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ursinus|first=Zacharias|title=The commentary of Dr. Zacharias Ursinus on the Heidelberg catechism|year=1888|publisher=Elm Street Printing Co|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hNpDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=pa2|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Berkhof]] called the law and the gospel "the two parts of the Word of God as a [[means of grace]]." Law and Gospel are found in both testaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berkhof|first=Louis|title=Systematic Theology|year=1979|publisher=Eerdmans|location=Grand Rapids, MI|pages=612}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]'', the Reformer [[John Calvin]] distinguished three uses in the Law. Calvin wrote the following: "[T]o make the whole matter clearer, let us survey briefly the function and use of what is called the 'moral law.' Now, so far as I understand it, it consists of three parts."

# "[W]hile it shows God's righteousness . . . , it warns, informs, convicts, and lastly condemns, every man of his own unrighteousness" (2.7.6).
# It functions "by fear of punishment to restrain certain men who are untouched by any care for what is just and right unless compelled by hearing the dire threats in the law" (2.7.10).
# "It admonishes believers and urges them on in well-doing" (2.7.12-13).

This scheme is the same as the [[Formula of Concord]], with the exception that the first and second uses are switched.

In later [[Reformed scholasticism]] the order is the same as for Lutherans. The three uses are called:

# The ''usus politicus sive civilis'', the political or civil use, is a restraint on sin and stands apart from the work of salvation. It is part of God's [[general revelation]] or [[common grace]] for unbelievers as well as believers.
# The ''usus elenchticus sive paedagogicus'', the elenctical or pedagogical use which confronts sin and points us to Christ.
# The ''usus didacticus sive normativus'', the didactic use, which is solely for believers, teaching the way of righteousness.&lt;ref name=muller&gt;{{cite book|last=Muller|first=Richard A.|title=Dictionary of Latin and Greek Theological Terms: Drawn Principally from Protestant Scholastic Theology|year=2006|publisher=Baker Book House|isbn=978-0801020643|pages=320–321|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Heidelberg Catechism]], in explaining the third use of the Law, teaches that the moral law as contained in the [[Ten Commandments]] is binding for Christians and that it instructs Christians how to live in service to God in gratitude for His grace shown in redeeming mankind.&lt;ref name="OPC2018"/&gt; John Calvin deemed this third use of the Law as its primary use.&lt;ref name="OPC2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.opc.org/qa.html?question_id=165|title=God's Law in Old and New Covenants|year=2018|publisher=[[Orthodox Presbyterian Church]]|language=English|accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lutheran and Reformed differences==
[[Lutheran scholasticism|Scholastic Lutheran]] and Reformed theologians differed primarily on the way in which the third use of the law functions for believers. The Reformed emphasized the third use (''tertius usus legis'') because the redeemed are expected to bear [[good works]]. Some Lutherans saw here the danger of works-righteousness, and argued that the third use should always return believers to the second use and again to Christ rather than being the ultimate norm.&lt;ref name=muller /&gt;

Additionally, some have suggested that the third use of the law is not found at all in Luther but comes from [[Philip Melanchthon]]. Although some Lutherans have rejected that view,&lt;ref name=ThirdUse&gt;[http://www.presenttruthmag.com/archive/VII/7-3.htm "The Third Use of Law"] by [[John Warwick Montgomery]] in ''Present Truth'', vol. 7&lt;/ref&gt; it has caused others to dispute the validity of the "third use" of the Law entirely. [[Paul Althaus]], for instance, writes in his treatise on Law and Gospel: "This [ethical] guidance by the Holy Spirit implies that God's concrete commanding cannot be read off from a written document, an inherited scheme of law. I must learn afresh every day what God wants of me. For God's commanding has a special character for each individual: it is always contemporary, always new. God commands me (and each person) in a particular way, in a different way than He commands others.... The living and spiritual character of the knowledge of what God requires of men in the present moment must not be destroyed by rules and regulations."&lt;ref name="althaus"&gt;Paul Althaus, &lt;cite&gt;The Divine Command&lt;/cite&gt;, pp. 43, 45&lt;/ref&gt; Such theologians believe the third use leads to or encourages a form of [[legalism (theology)|legalism]] and is possibly an implicit denial of [[sola fide]]. Conversely, Reformed Christians have sometimes seen this two-use scheme of some modern Lutherans as leading to a form of [[antinomianism]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Some believe that "for Luther the pedagogic use of the Law was primary, while for Calvin this third or didactic use was the principal one; yet [historically] both the Lutheran and the Reformed traditions maintain the threefold conceptualization."&lt;ref name=ThirdUse /&gt;

==Methodist view==
[[John Wesley]] admonished [[Methodist]] preachers to emphasize both the Law and the Gospel:&lt;ref name="Seedbed2016"&gt;{{cite web |title=Wesley on Preaching Law and Gospel |url=https://www.seedbed.com/law-gospel-wesley/ |publisher=Seedbed |date=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|Undoubtedly both should be preached in their turn; yea, both at once, or both in one. All the conditional promises are instances of this. They are law and gospel mixed together. According to this model, I should advise every preacher continually to preach the law — the law grafted upon, tempered by, and animated with the spirit of the gospel. I advise him to declare explain, and enforce every command of God. But meantime to declare in every sermon (and the more explicitly the better) that the flint and great command to a Christian is, ‘Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ’: that Christ is all in all, our wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption; that all life, love, strength are from Him alone, and all freely given to us through faith. And it will ever be found that the law thus preached both enlightens and strengthens the soul; that it both nourishes and teaches; that it is the guide, ‘ food, medicine, and stay’ of the believing soul.&lt;ref name="Seedbed2016"/&gt;}}
Methodism makes a distinction between the ceremonial law and the moral law that is the [[Ten Commandments]] given to Moses.&lt;ref name="Dayton1991"/&gt; In Methodist Christianity, the moral law is the "fundamental ontological principle of the universe" and "is grounded in eternity", being "engraved on human hearts by the finger of God."&lt;ref name="Dayton1991"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dayton |first1=Donald W. |title=Law and Gospel in the Wesleyan Tradition |journal=Grace Theological Journal |date=1991 |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=233-243 |url=https://biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/gtj/12-2_233.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contradistinction to the teaching of the Lutheran Churches, the Methodist Churches bring the Law and the Gospel together in a profound sense: "the law is grace and through it we discover the good news of the way life is intended to be lived."&lt;ref name="Dayton1991"/&gt; John Wesley, the father of the Methodist tradition taught:&lt;ref name="Dayton1991"/&gt;
{{quotation|... there is no contrariety at all between the law and the gospel; ... there is no need for the law to pass away in order to the establishing of the gospel. Indeed neither of them supersedes the other, but they agree perfectly well together. Yea, the very same words, considered in different respects, are parts both of the law and the gospel. If they are considered as commandments, they are parts of the law: if as promises, of the gospel. Thus, 'Thou shalt love the Lord the God with all thy heart,' when considered as a commandment, is a branch of the law; when regarded as a promise, is an essential part of the gospel-the gospel being no other than the commands of the law proposed by way of promises. Accordingly poverty of spirit, purity of heart, and whatever else is enjoined in the holy law of God, are no other, when viewed in a gospel light, than so many great and precious promises. There is therefore the closest connection that can be conceived between the law and the gospel. On the one hand the law continually makes way for and points us to the gospel; on the other the gospel continually leads us to a more exact fulfilling of the law .... We may yet further observe that every command in Holy Writ is only a covered promise. (Sermon 25, "Sermon on the Mount, V," II, 2, 3)&lt;ref name="Dayton1991"/&gt;}}

[[Daniel Defoe]] discusses three pairs of these predicates in his second and final sequel to ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', ''Serious Reflections'' (1720): "forbear and live", "do and live", "believe and live". According to Defoe, the first was established with Adam in paradise, the second as the Law with the children of Israel, and the third as the Gospel of Jesus Christ&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iT4KFumK2PkC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=3&amp;hl=en&amp;sig=ACfU3U1OWLpiDB7F9R7x3bPnxlThfi89ZA&amp;ci=66%2C873%2C762%2C407&amp;edge=0 ''Serious reflections during the life and surprising adventures of Robinson Crusoe: with his Vision of the angelic world''].

However Luther viewed all imperative commands as law, even the command to believe the Gospel. In [[On the Bondage of the Will|The Bondage of the Will]] he writes,

"[T]he commands exist to show, not our moral ability, but our inability. This includes God's command of all men everywhere to repent and believe the gospel, an impossible act of will apart from a supernatural work of the Holy Spirit uniting us to Christ .." p.&amp;nbsp;149

The law of North America is diverse and influential. The [[law of the United States]] has worldwide renown, in its codified constitution, and [[bill of rights]], while the [[law of Cuba]] differs vastly in its regulation of private property. The first court of justice was established in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[Canada]] in 1615 by Sir [[Richard Whitbourne]] as a [[court of admiralty]] at the future site of [[Trinity, Newfoundland and Labrador]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/canada/Alberta-to-Nova-Scotia/Newfoundland-and-Labrador.html |title=Newfoundland and Labrador |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |publisher=Nations Encyclopedia |accessdate=May 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6620">'''Legal advice''' is the giving of a professional or formal opinion regarding the substance or procedure of the [[law]] in relation to a particular factual situation. The provision of legal advice will often involve analyzing a set of facts and advising a person to take a specific course of action based on the applicable law.&lt;ref name="calcourt"&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal Advice vs. Legal Information|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/mayihelpyou.pdf|website=Judicial Council of California|publisher=California Courts|date=2003|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eladvice"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=How to Get Free Legal Advice Online, and What to Watch Out For|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/consumer/free_legal_advice.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=8 September 2017|date=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal advice is ordinarily provided in exchange for financial or other tangible compensation. Advice given without remuneration is normally referred to as being ''[[pro bono|pro bono publico]]'' (in the public good), or simply ''pro bono''.

In the [[common law]] systems it is usually received from a [[solicitor]], [[barrister]] or [[lawyer]];&lt;ref name="sbmich"&gt;{{cite web|title=Unauthorized Practice of Law|url=https://www.michbar.org/file/professional/pdfs/uplfacts.pdf|website=State Bar of Michigan|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kao|first1=Frances P.|title=No, a paralegal is not a lawyer|journal=Business Law Today|date=2 January 2007|volume=16|issue=3|url=https://apps.americanbar.org/buslaw/blt/2007-01-02/kao.shtml|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IS BA and the Unauthorized Practice of Law - What The Public Needs To Know|url=https://www.isba.org/sites/default/files/committees/upl/uplfaq.pdf|website=Illinois State Bar Association|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems it is given by [[advocate]]s, [[lawyer]]s or other professionals (such as [[tax advisor|tax experts]], professional advisors, atc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Competitive Restrictions in Legal Professions|url=https://www.oecd.org/regreform/sectors/40080343.pdf|website=OECD|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|accessdate=8 September 2017|date=27 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, legal advice is subject to the possession of a specific licence; in others, it is simply subject to the general regulation of [[obligation|professional obligation]] and can be provided by any person, who will usually be [[legal liability|legally responsible]] for the provided advice. The UK's [[Legal Services Act 2007]] includes the giving of legal advice within the definition of unreserved legal activities, which means that it can be provided by any person not just an officer of the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roy|first1=Alex|last2=Handford|first2=Chris|title=Reserved and Unreserved Lawyers’ Activities|url=http://www.legalservicesboard.org.uk/Projects/rationalising_scope_of_regulation/pdf/reserved_and_unreserved_lawyers.pdf|website=Legal Services Board|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if it is provided by a lawyer or another person authorised by one of the front line legal services regulators, then this activity is included within their regulatory reach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Plant|first1=Charles|title=The definition of reserved legal activities should be extended|url=https://www.lawgazette.co.uk/analysis/the-definition-of-reserved-legal-activities-should-be-extended/61811.article|accessdate=8 September 2017|agency=The Law Society Gazette|date=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of the internet, many services have been established to provide individuals the power to conduct their own legal research or prepare their own legal documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Julee C.|title=Policing the Self-Help Legal Market: Consumer Protection or Protection of the Legal Cartel|journal=Indiana Law Review|date=2000|volume=34|page=121|url=https://mckinneylaw.iu.edu/ILR/pdf/vol34p121.pdf|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, some companies offer answers to legal questions directly through their web services.&lt;ref name="eladvice"/&gt;

==Legal information==
Legal advice is distinguished from '''legal information''' which is the reiteration of legal fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://hirealawyer.findlaw.com/do-you-need-a-lawyer/what-is-legal-advice.html| title=What is 'Legal Advice'?| publisher=FindLaw| accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal information can be conveyed by a parking meter, sign or by other forms of notice such as a warning by a [[police|law enforcement officer]].

Printed legal materials, such as directions and [[how-to]] manuals, are generally not considered legal advice. Accordingly, instructions on how to meet court requirements for the submission of forms and other court documents do not constitute legal advice.&lt;ref name="calcourt"/&gt; Thus, a non-lawyer may sell legal forms, provide general instructions for filling out the forms, and provide typing services for the entry of information into forms, provided no legal advice is given.&lt;ref name="sbmich"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Denckla|first1=Derek A.|title=Nonlawyers and the Unauthorized Practice of Law: An Overview of the Legal and Ethical Parameters|journal=Fordham Law Revie w|date=1999|volume=67|issue=5|page=2581|url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/flr/vol67/iss5/32/|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Basic instruction on how to complete a legal form, where to place information on the form, and the definition of legal terms used on a form constitute the provision of legal information. Instructing a person on how to phrase information in a legal document or form, or advising the person as to what he or she should say in court, is the provision of legal advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unauthorized Practice of Law|url=https://www.scbar.org/public/get-legal-help/problems-your-lawyer/unauthorized-practice-of-law-committee/|website=South Carolina Bar|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="calcourt"/&gt; Similarly, application of legal rules and principles to a specific set of facts and advising a course of conduct is almost always held to constitute legal advice.&lt;ref name="calcourt"/&gt;

{{Basel II}}
{{Financial risk types}}
[[Basel II]] classified '''legal risk''' as a subset of [[operational risk]] in 2003. This conception is based on a business perspective, recognizing that there are threats entailed in the [[Business operations|business operating environment]]. The idea is that businesses do not operate in a vacuum and that, in the exploitation of opportunities and their engagement with other businesses, their activities tend to become subjects of [[Legal liability|legal liabilities]] and [[obligation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Simple Tools and Techniques for Enterprise Risk Management|last=Chapman|first=Robert|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2011|isbn=9781119989974|location=Chichester, West Sussex|pages=435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the primary reasons why legal risk is associated with operational risk involves [[fraud]] since it is recognized as the most significant category of operational loss events and considered to be a legal issue as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Operational Risk Management|last=Moosa|first=Imad|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2007|isbn=9781349352951|location=New York|pages=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; These, however, do not mean that legal risk is only confined to this conceptualization because it is defined in more than way. For instance, there are specific sets of legal risks that are defined by the [[European Union law|European Union (EU) Law]]. In 2005, the [[European Central Bank]] declared that it will develop its own legal risk definition to help "facilitate proper risk assessment and risk management, as well as ensure a consistent approach between EU credit institutions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Legal Risks in EU Law: Interdisciplinary Studies on Legal Risk Management and Better Regulation in Europe|last=Mišćenić|first=Emilia|last2=Raccah|first2=Aurélien|publisher=Springer|year=2016|isbn=9783319285955|location=Berlin|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
There is no standard definition, but there are at least two primary/secondary definition sets in circulation.

'''Mcormick, R. 2004'''
Legal risk is the risk of loss to an institution which is primarily caused by:&lt;br&gt;
(a) a defective transaction; or&lt;br&gt;
(b) a claim (including a defense to a claim or a counterclaim) being made or some other event occurring which results in a liability for the institution or other loss (for example, as a result of the termination of a contract) or;&lt;br&gt;
(c) failing to take appropriate measures to protect assets (for example, intellectual property) owned by the institution; or&lt;br&gt;
(d) change in law.&lt;ref name="McCormick"&gt;Roger McCormick. "Legal Risk in the Financial Markets", Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mcormick, R. 2004'''
Management of legal risk is not a precise science and subjective to the situation of the institution, and primarily caused by the lack of proper communication channel, undefined institutional objectives (such as the lack of policies and regulations), unclarified information flow between different personnel and department, lack of delegation of power to specify task on mitigation of risks.&lt;ref name="McCormick2"&gt;Roger McCormick. "The Management of Legal RIsk by Financial Institutions", RSM&lt;/ref&gt;

;Johnson and Swanson. 2007
The expenses of litigation of a company.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imanet.org/resources_and_publications/management_accounting_quarterly/issues/Fall_2007.aspx|title=Issues|author=IMA|work=imanet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Whalley, M. 2016
Legal risk is the risk of financial or reputational loss that can result from lack of awareness or misunderstanding of, ambiguity in, or reckless indifference to, the way law and regulation apply to your business, its relationships, processes, products and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/ey-legal-risk-2-show-you-are-in-control/$FILE/ey-legal-risk-2-show-you-are-in-control.pdf|title=Legal risk 2.0: Show you're in control}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Tsui TC. 2013
The cost and loss of income caused by legal uncertainty, multiplied by possibility of the individual event or legal environment as a whole.&lt;ref name="Tsui"&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=2260965|title=Experience from the Anti-Monopoly Law Decision in China (Cost and Benefit of Rule of Law)|work=ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most obvious legal risks of doing business not mentioned in the above definitions is the risk of arrest and prosecution.

All definitions contain more detail.

'''Legal science''' is one of the main components in the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] tradition (after [[Roman law]], [[canon law]], [[commercial law]], and the legacy of the revolutionary period).

Legal science is primarily the creation of German legal scholars of the middle and late nineteenth century, and it evolved naturally out of the ideas of [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]].  Savigny argued that German codification should not follow the rationalist and [[secular natural law]] thinking that characterized the French codification but should be based on the principles of law that had historically been in force in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Merryman et al., The Civil Law Tradition: Europe, Latin America, and East Asia, Cases and Materials 481 (LexisNexis ed., 1994) (reprinted 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore]]'s ''Reports of Cases Heard and Determined by the Judicial Committee and the Lords of His Majesty's most Honourable Privy Council on Appeal from the Supreme and Sudder Dewanny Courts in the East Indies'' published in London from 1837 to 1873, referred to as ''[[Moore's Indian Appeals]]'' and cited for example as: ''Moofti Mohummud Ubdoollah'' v.

:''The following [[Portal:Contents/Outlines|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to law:
'''Law''' (''[[law|article link]]'') is the set of rules and principles (laws) by which a society is governed, through enforcement by governmental authorities.  Law is also the field which concerns the creation and administration of laws, and includes any and all [[Legal systems of the world|legal systems]].

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== Nature of law ==
Law can be described as all of the following:

* [[Academic discipline]] &amp;ndash; body of knowledge given to - or received by - a disciple (student); a branch or sphere of knowledge, or field of study, that an individual has chosen to specialise in.
** one of the [[humanities]] &amp;ndash; academic discipline that study the human condition, using methods that are primarily analytical, critical, or speculative, as distinguished from the mainly empirical approaches of the natural sciences.
* [[Fields of science|Field of science]]  &amp;ndash; widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature.  Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer reviewed research is published.  There are many sociology-related scientific journals.
** [[Social science]]  &amp;ndash; field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of human society.
* [[System]] &amp;ndash; set of elements (often called 'components' instead) and relationships which are different from relationships of the set or its elements to other elements or sets.
** part of the [[legal system]] &amp;ndash; legal scholarship and practice shapes how law is interpreted and applied in societies

==Legal systems==
* [[List of national legal systems]]
* [[Common law]]
* [[Civil law (legal system)]]
* [[Religious law]]
** [[Bahá'í laws]]
** [[Biblical law]], in [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]]
** [[Canon law]], in Christianity
*** [[Canons of the Apostles]]
*** [[Canon law of the Anglican Communion]]
*** [[Canon law of the Catholic Church]]
****[[Canon (canon law)]] - a certain rule or norm of conduct or belief prescribed by the Catholic Church. The word "canon" comes from the Greek kanon, which in its original usage denoted a straight rod that was later the instrument used by architects and artificers as a measuring stick for making straight lines. 
****[[Custom (canon law)]] - the repeated and constant performance of certain acts for a defined period of time, which, with the approval of the competent legislator, thereby acquire the force of law. A custom is an unwritten law introduced by the continuous acts of the faithful with the consent of the legitimate legislator. 
****[[Decree (canon law)]] - an order or law made by a superior authority for the direction of others. 
****[[Dispensation (canon law)]] - the exemption from the immediate obligation of law in certain cases. Its object is to modify the hardship often arising from the rigorous application of general laws to particular cases, and its essence is to preserve the law by suspending its operation in such cases. 
****[[Interpretation (canon law)]] - canonists provide and obey rules for the interpretation and acceptation of words, in order that legislation is correctly understood and the extent of its obligation is determined. 
****[[Obrogation]] -  the enacting of a contrary law that is a revocation of a previous law. It may also be the partial cancellation or amendment of a law, decree, or legal regulation by the imposition of a newer one. 
****[[Promulgation (canon law)]] - the publication of a law by which it is made known publicly, and is required by canon law for the law to obtain legal effect.
** [[Halakha]], in Judaism
** [[Hindu law]]
** [[Jain law]]
** [[Patimokkha]], in [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]]
** [[Sharia]], in [[Islam]]

[[File:Skandinavism.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The mid-19th century [[Scandinavism]] political movement led to the modern use of the term [[Scandinavia]].]]

In the [[social science]]s, a '''political movement''' is a [[social group]] that operates together to obtain a [[political]] [[goal]],&lt;ref&gt;[[dict:political movement|Political movement]]. dict.org&lt;/ref&gt; on a local, regional, national, or international scope. Political [[Political process theory|movements develop]], [[Coordination game|coordinate]],&lt;ref&gt;''See also:'' [[Coordination failure (political science)|Coordination failure]]&lt;/ref&gt; promulgate,&lt;ref&gt;''See:'' [[decree]]s, [[Speech_act#Classifying_illocutionary_speech_acts|declaration]]s, and [[wikt:announcement|announcement]]s&lt;/ref&gt; revise,&lt;ref&gt;''See:'' [[Historical revisionism|political revisionism]] and [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|negationism]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amendment|amend]],&lt;ref&gt;''See also:'' [[Constitutional amendment]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermeneutics|interpret]],&lt;ref&gt;''See also:'' [[Judicial interpretation]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Propaganda|produce materials]] that are intended to address the goals of the [[Identity politics|base of the movement]]. A [[social movement]] in the area of [[politics]] can be organized around a single issue or set of issues, or around a set of shared concerns of a [[social group]]. In a [[political party]], a [[political organization]] seeks to influence, or control, [[government policy]], usually by nominating their candidates and seating candidates in politics and governmental offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mc Donald|first=Neil|title=The Study of Political Parties|year=1963|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, parties participate in [[elections|electoral campaigns]] and educational outreach or protest actions aiming to convince citizens or governments to take action on the issues and concerns which are the focus of the movement. Parties often espouse an [[ideology]], expressed in a party program, bolstered by a written [[Party platform|platform]] with specific goals, forming a [coalition] among [[disparate]] interests.

==Examples==
Some political movements have aimed to change government policy, such as the [[Peace movement|anti-war movement]], the [[ecology movement]], and the [[anti-globalization movement]].  Many have aimed to establish or broaden the rights of subordinate groups, such as [[abolitionism]], the [[women's suffrage]] movement, the [[civil rights movement]], [[feminism]], [[LGBT social movements|gay rights movement]], the [[disability rights movement]], or the inclusive [[human rights]] movement.  Some have represented class interests, such as the [[Labour movement]], [[socialism]], and [[communism]], others have expressed national aspirations, such as [[Anticolonialism|anticolonialist]] movements, [[Ratana]], [[Zionism]], and [[Sinn Féin]].  Political movements can also involve struggles to decentralize or centralize state control, as in [[anarchism]], [[fascism]], and [[Nazism]].

With [[globalization]], [[global citizens movement]]s may have emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Global Citizens Movement. A New Actor For a New Politics | publisher=TransNational Institute | date=2001-10-18 | accessdate=2013-06-05 | author=George, Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Movements may be named by outsiders, as with the [[levellers]] political movement in 17th century England was so named as a [[term of disparagement]]. Yet admirers of the movement and its aims later came to use the term, and it is the term by which they are known to history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Plant, David | url = http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/glossary/levellers.htm | title = The Levellers | accessdate = 2013-06-05| date = 2005-12-14 | work = British Civil Wars and Commonwealth website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Principles of [[Islam]]ic [[jurisprudence]]''' otherwise known as '''''Uṣūl al-[[fiqh]]''''' ({{lang-ar|أصول الفقه}})  is the study and critical analysis of the origins, sources, and principles upon which Islamic jurisprudence (''[[fiqh]]'') is based.

Traditionally four main sources ([[Qur’an]], [[Sunnah]], consensus (''[[Ijma]]''), analogical reason (''[[Qiyas]]'')) are analysed along with a number of secondary sources and principles.  

The main subject areas of discussion are these:
* General evidences and principles (''adillah ijmalliya wa al-qawaid'')
* Resolution of conflict and discrepancy (''ta'deel wa tarjeeh'')
* Determination of rules and adoption/emulation of rules (''ijtihad wa taqlid'')
* Islamic Law (''hukm shari'')

==Etymology==
''Uṣūl al-fiqh'' comprises the conjunction of two Arabic terms, ''uṣūl'' and ''fiqh''. ''Uṣūl'' is derived from the root letters [[hamza]], [[sad (letter)|sad]] and [[lām]] which refers to basis. ''Fiqh'' linguistically refers to knowledge, deep understanding or comprehension.

Technically the term is used to refer to the body of evidences and principles that Islamic jurists utilize to provide solutions to problems.

==Definition of the Science of Uşūl al-Fiqh==
The science of uşūl al-fiqh is a science in which such rules whose results are placed in ways of deduction of juristic precepts are discussed. For instance, performing the prayers (şalāt) is mandatory in Islam, and this Qur’ānic verse proves that obligation: “And that perform the prayers” (6, 72). However, denotation of the verse is dependent upon the imperative, like “perform” in that verse, being apparent in the obligation on the one hand and Qur’ānic apparent meanings being authoritative on the other. Those two issues are dealt with in the science of uşūl al-fiqh. Now, when the jurist learns through this science that the imperative is apparent in the obligation and that the Qur’ānic apparent meanings are authoritative proofs, he can infer from the said verse that the prayers is mandatory.&lt;ref name="Hodaee"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hodaee|first1=Alireza|title=An Introduction to Methodology of Islamic Jurisprudence: A Shiite Approach|url=http://ijtihadnet.com/introduction-methodology-islamic-jurisprudence-shiite-approachpdf/|website=http://ijtihadnet.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Aqidah}}
The [[Qur'an]] has always been regarded as the primary legal source of Islam, the speech of [[Allah]]. It has been transmitted through numerous chains (''mutawatir''). According to Roy Mottahedeh, "For over a thousand years the great majority of Muslim jurists agreed" that of the more than 6000 verses in the Qur'an, 500 have some legal content, most concerning [[ibadah]] (worship or religious ritual such as [[salat]] (prayer), [[hajj]] (pilgrimage), [[sawm]] (fasting), [[zakat]] (tithing)).   190 Qur'anic verses deal with some "aspects of the law" other than ibadah, but of these aspects "only matters of inheritance are laid out in any detail". &lt;ref name="Mottahedeh-intro-2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mottahedeh|first1=Roy|title=Lessons in Islamic Jurisprudence|date=2003|publisher=Oneworld Publications. |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=elcQBwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Principles+of+Islamic+jurisprudence&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwionOylkLPaAhWqz4MKHeGwC6oQ6AEIUzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Principles%20of%20Islamic%20jurisprudence&amp;f=false |accessdate=11 April 2018 |chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For elaboration of the [[Quran]] or for clarification of a matter that is not mentioned in the Quran, these verses are supplemented by further revelation termed [[sunnah]]. Sunnah comprises explanations from Muhammad in terms of his speech, actions and silences which have been historically compiled and verified through chains of narrations called [[hadith]]s. Sunnah is second in prioritisation to Quran.

The Muslim [[jurists]] have found that some revelation has been captured through collective agreements expressed after the death of Muhammad through consensus of his companions which were transmitted over the ages. These are compiled as instances of consensus of the companions (''[[ijma al-sahaba]]'').

Therefore, the Qur’ān and the Sunnah are the two main sources of Islamic Legal Theory. However, the majority of jurists are of the view that Islamic law is based on four sources. 
* Ijmā‘ (consensus). It took the jurists considerable time to prove through the texts of the Qur’ān and the Sunnah that ijmā‘ is a valid source of law, and any that ḥukm (ruling) based on it should be accorded the status of the ḥukm of Allah . 
* Qiyās (analogy) was also successfully used to deduce the law from the Qur’ān and the Sunnah. The law deduced by Qiyās and ijmā‘ are actually dependent on evidence from the two main sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kayadibi |first1=Saim|title=Principles of Islamic Law and the Methods of Interpretation of the Texts (Uṣūl al-Fiqh) |date=2017|publisher=Islamic Book Trust|isbn=978 967 0526 33 1|pages=94 |edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only when these failed to provide the authority sought did jurists resort to interpretation ''[[ijtihad]]''.

In the very early days of Islam Muslim authorities tended to rely on their own opinions to establish their interpretation of what a prescribed law should be for any given situation not founded on the Qur'an, a practice known as ''[[ra'y]]''.

The jurist [[ash-Shafi'i]], however, preferred to rely solely on traditions from Muhammad and thereafter on the method known as ''[[qiyas]]'' ([[analogy]]) where interpretations were to be derived from comparisons with relative subjects dealt with in the Qur'an or the traditions.

It is now the scholarly consensus, amongst both orientalist and traditional scholarship, that the following is a myth: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Once Shafi'i's school of law was fully established together with the other schools founded by [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]], [[Abu Hanifa]] and [[Malik]], the "door" of ''ijtihad'' was closed and it was considered that ''ijma'' had been reached on all necessary points of law (though the schools differ in many matters to this day but mostly on minor points of interpretation). Accordingly, Islamic jurisprudence has changed little for centuries and is based fundamentally on the four sources mentioned above. There is much debate and critique as to whether closing the gates of ijtihad was acceptable and whether it contributed to the intellectual and civislisational decline of the Muslims."{{cn|date=February 2017}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wael Hallaq is widely credited for decisively discrediting this myth in the western world, whereas others such as Qasim Zaman continue to show how the Ulema continued to actively engage in Ijtihad. However, there is a valid debate over the degree to which the Ulema remained active in such endeavours ever since colonialism and modernity intruded Muslim lands. In fact, faced with such drastic change, there are certain cases that do show the Ulema to be initially dismissive of sociopolitical realities and hence lagging in their response- Nevertheless, eventually finding legal stratagems to solve dilemmas. A case in point is the issue of women's divorce in the time of Ashraf Ali Thanvi.&lt;ref&gt;http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/60731/1/fareehak_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Shi'a schools, they have continued with ''ijtihad'' to the present day. They however disputed the methodology of compilation of narrations of sunnah and also limited consensus of the companions to consensus of the family of Muhammad (''[[ijma]] [[ahl al-bayt]]'')

==Secondary sources==
*''Istihsan''
*''Masali Mursala''
*''Ihsaan'' (spiritual excellence, virtue)
*''Istidlaal''
*''Urf'' (local custom or pre-existing law)
*''Aql'' (reason or intellect)
*''Sadd al-dharai''
*''Shara man qablana''
*''Ijma al-ummah'' (consensus of the worldwide Muslim community)
*''Ijma khulafah al-rashideen'' (consensus of the first four caliphs)
*''Ijma ahl al-medina'' (consensus of the Muslims of Medina, as reflected in early hadith collections, ''e.&amp;thinsp;g.'' the ''Muwatta'' of Imam Malik ibn Anas)
*''Ijma al-ullama'' (consensus of scholars of Islamic law)
*''Ijma ahl al-hali wa al-aqd''

==The schools of thought==

The schools of [[Sunnite|Sunni]] Islam are each named by students of the classical jurist who taught them.  The [[Sunni]] schools (and where they are commonly found) are
*[[Hanbali]] ([[Saudi Arabia]] and parts of [[Syria]] and [[Jordan]])
*[[Hanafi]] ([[Turkey]], [[the Balkans]], [[Central Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[northwest China]] and [[Egypt]])
*[[Maliki]] ([[North Africa]], [[West Africa]], [[Sudan]] and several of the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]])
*[[Shafi'i]] ([[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Egypt]], [[East Africa]], [[Yemen]], [[Somalia]] and southern parts of [[India]])
*[[Zahiri]] (minority communities in [[Morocco]] and [[Pakistan]])
*[[Qurtubi]] No longer exists
*[[Laythi]] No longer exists
*[[Awza'i]] No longer exists

The schools of [[Shia]] Islam comprise:
*[[Ja'fari]] ([[Iran]], [[Iraq]])
*[[Zaydi]]

The schools of [[Khawarij]] comprise:
*[[Ibadi]] ([[Oman]])

These schools share many of their rulings, but differ on the particular [[hadith]]s they accept as authentic and the weight they give to analogy or reason ([[qiyas]]) in deciding difficulties.

== Principles within Sunni Islam ==
{{fiqh}}
* That which is necessary to achieve an obligation is obligatory
* That which leads to haram is haram
* Lesser of the two evils
* The doubt does not remove the certainty

Islamic law within the Sunni understanding draws from numerous sources. The most basic two sources {{spaced ndash}} indeed, the defining characteristics of Sunni Islam {{spaced ndash}} are the [[Qur'an]], believed by Muslims to be the literal word of [[God in Islam|God]], and the [[Sunnah|prophetic tradition]] including the statements and actions of [[Muhammad]] passed down through historically verifiable [[Hadith|reports]]. [[Ijma|consensus]] is also accepted by Sunni Muslims, though there is much differing over its exact definition. [[Qiyas|Analogical reason]] is typically referred to as a fourth primary source by later and modern Muslim authors, though its exact definition and even validity are not unchallenged.

Beyond the four main sources, other methods such as [[Istihsan|juristic discretion]], [[Istislah|public welfare]] and [[Urf|local custom]] are often considered, though discussions regarding how these sources are to be applied is ongoing.

===The contribution of al-Shafi'i===
[[Al-Shafi'i]] documented a systematized set of principles, developing a cohesive procedure for legal [[Ijtihad|derivation of verdicts]]. His approach contrasted with the [[Hanafite]] methodology that determined the sources from the sayings and rulings of the companions and successors.  Furthermore, he raised the [[Sunnah]] to a place of prominence and restricted its legal use.  According to Shafi'i, only practices directly passed down from [[Muhammad]] were valid, eliminating the legitimacy of practices of Muhammad's followers.  Prior to Shafi'i, legal reasoning included personal reasoning thus suffering from inconsistency.  Shafi'i is probably best known for writing [[Al-Risala (book)|Risala]], a prime example of applying logic and order to Islamic jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islambasics.com/view.php?bkID=166&amp;chapter=5 |title=Usul Al Fiqh After Al Imam Al Shafi'i| accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Risala is considered a seminal work in the field of principles, it has been noted that the term "usul" is neither found in the title of the book nor is it used as such within the text.&lt;ref name="Stewart, pg. 105"&gt;Stewart, pg. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution of methods===
Between Shafi'i's Risala and the next attested works of usul is a gap of several hundred years. These later works were significantly different from Shafi'is book, likely due to the insertion of [[Mu'tazila|Mu'tazilite]] and [[Ash'ari]]te theology into works of jurisprudence.&lt;ref name=devin102&gt;[[Devin J. Stewart]], "Muhammad b. Dawud al-Zahiri's Manual of Jurisprudence." Taken from Studies in Islamic Law and Society Volume 15: Studies in Islamic Legal Theory. Edited by [[Bernard G. Weiss]]. Pg. 102. [[Leiden]]: 2002. [[Brill Publishers]].&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between Shafi'i's work and these later works {{spaced ndash}} in terms of both content and the large chronological gap between which they were all composed {{spaced ndash}} is so great that modern scholarship has questioned the status of Shafi'i as the founder of Islamic jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wael Hallaq]], ''Was al-Shafi‘i the Master Architect of Islamic Jurisprudence?'', [[International Journal of Middle East Studies]], 4 (November 1993), pg. 587-605.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Makdisi, ''Juridical Theology'', pg. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, pg. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Topics which became staples of written work on the principles of jurisprudence, such as reason versus revelation and interfaith debates regarding abrogation after revelation in Islam versus Judaism, were not even discussed by Shafi'i.

Indeed, even the division of the sources of Sunni law into four {{spaced ndash}} Qur'an, [[Sunnah|prophetic tradition]], [[Ijma|consensus]] and [[Qiyas|analogical reason]] {{spaced ndash}} was not present in Shafi'is books at all, despite Muslim scholarship generally attributing this division to him.&lt;ref&gt;"Does Shafi'i Have a Theory of 'Four Sources' of Law?, taken from the PhD dissertation of Joseph E. Lowry, ''The Legal-Theoretical Content of the Risala of Muhammad B. Idris al-Shafi'i'', [[University of Pennsylvania]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Qadi al-Nu'man]], one of the earliest jurists to write about usul after Shafi'i did - perhaps during Shafi'is lifetime - was Abū 'Ubaid al-Qāsim b. Sallām, who actually considered the sources of law to consist of only three {{spaced ndash}} the Qur'an, the prophetic tradition, and consensus consisting of either scholarly consensus or consensus of the early generations.&lt;ref name="Stewart, pg. 105"/&gt; This division into four sources is most often attributed to later jurists upon whose work most Sunni jurisprudence has been modeled such as [[Al-Baqillani|Baqillani]] and [[Abd al-Jabbar ibn Ahmad]],&lt;ref&gt;Hallaq, A history of Islamic legal theories : an introduction to Sunnī uṣūl al-fiqh. Pg. 30-35. New York: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Ash'arite and Mu'tazilite schools respectively. Thus, the four main sources often attributed to Shafi'i evolved into popular usage long after his death.

Additionally, the later scholars of the four mainstream Sunni schools of law all increased beyond four sources; while the four sources are the most widely accepted, other practices such as the [[Fatwa]]s of the first generation of Muslims and the application of [[pure reason]] are not universally accepted.

===Application of sources===
Even after this evolution, there are still some disputes among Sunni [[jurists]] regarding these four sources and their application. [[Malik ibn Anas]], [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] and in particular [[Dawud al-Zahiri]] rejected all forms of analogical reason in authentic narrations from them,&lt;ref name=ali280&gt;[[Chiragh Ali]], The Proposed Political, Legal and Social Reforms. Taken from Modernist Islam 1840-1940: A Sourcebook, pg. 280. Edited by [[Charles Kurzman]]. [[New York City]]: [[Oxford University Press]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mansoor&gt;Mansoor Moaddel, ''Islamic Modernism, Nationalism, and Fundamentalism: Episode and Discourse'', pg. 32. [[Chicago]]: [[University of Chicago Press]], 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Reuben Levy]], ''Introduction to the Sociology of Islam'', pg. 237, 239 and 245. [[London]]: Williams and Norgate, 1931-1933.&lt;/ref&gt; yet the later [[Maliki]]tes and [[Hanbali]]tes {{spaced ndash}} and in some cases, even [[Zahiri]]tes {{spaced ndash}} gravitated toward the acceptance of varying levels of analogical reason already accepted by [[Shafi'i]]tes and [[Hanafi]]tes.&lt;ref name=mansoor/&gt; Malik and [[Abu Hanifa]] both accepted pure reason as a source of law; Ahmad and Shafi'i did not, and Shafi'i was especially hostile to [[Istihsan|juristic preference]] as implemented by Abu Hanifa, yet pure reason later found its way into all Sunni schools of law.

The question of consensus has evolved considerably. Abu Hanifa, Ahmad and Zahiri only accepted the consensus of the [[Sahaba|first generation]] of Muslims,&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Muslehuddin, "Philosophy of Islamic Law and Orientalists," Kazi Publications, 1985, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="farooq"&gt;Dr. Mohammad Omar Farooq, "The Doctrine of Ijma: Is there a consensus?," June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; while Malik was willing to accept the consensus of the first generation in general or the consensus of later generations within the community of [[Medina]].&lt;ref name=mansoor/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muslehuddin, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; Shafi'i insinuated that consensus was not practically possible to confirm.&lt;ref&gt;[[Majid Khadduri]], Introduction to [[Al-Shafi'i]]'s [[Al-Risala (book)|al-Risala]], pg.33&lt;/ref&gt; Later scholars of all schools eventually followed the views of [[Al-Ghazali]] and [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] in expanding the definition of accepted consensus to include scholarly consensus and silent consensus as well.&lt;ref name="farooq"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khadduri, pg. 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles within Shia Islam==
In [[Shi'a]] legal theory, analogical reason isn't recognised as a source of law; pure reason is, however.&lt;ref&gt;Moaddel, pg. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Shi'ites may differ in the exact application of principles depending on whether they follow the [[Ja'fari]], [[Ismailism|Ismaili]] or [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] subdivisions of Shi'ism.

===Ja'fari principles===

{{main article|Usul Fiqh in Ja'fari school}}
There are two interpretations of what constitutes sources of law among jurists of the Ja'fari school.

*According to the [[Akhbari]] view, the only sources of law are the [[Quran]] and the [[Hadith]], and any case not explicitly covered by one of these must be regarded as not having been provided for.
*According to the majority [[Usuli]] view, it is legitimate to seek general principles by induction, in order to provide for cases not expressly provided for.  This process is known as [[ijtihad]], and the [['Aql|intellect]] is recognised as a source of law.  It differs from the Sunni [[qiyas]] in that it does not simply extend existing laws on a test of factual resemblance: it is necessary to formulate a general principle that can be rationally supported.

[[Javadi Amoli]] wrote about source of revelation in Shiism:
# The most important source in [[Shiite]] law is the [[Quran]] itself, which interprets itself 
# The other source is the tradition of the "infallibles" (the family of Muhammad), according to the successive tradition (Saqalain) passed down by the family of the Muhammad as well as according to the [[Quran]] itself: to accept one without the other is equivalent to rejecting both of them.
# A third source is theoretical wisdom where it is impossible to conceive the contrary, which proves the existence of God and the necessity of his unity, eternity, pre-existence, power, will and other exalted attributes: this cannot be denied with any verse.
# Although we cannot impose science upon the Quran, we can use verified scientific, experimental, historical, artistic, logical and other evidence to interpret the subject addressed in a given passage, rather than through another verse.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tasnim]] ([[tafsir]]), Vol 1, Page 57&lt;/ref&gt;

In doubtful cases the law is often derived not from substantive principles induced from existing rules, but from procedural presumptions (''usul 'amaliyyah'') concerning factual probability.  An example is the presumption of continuity: if one knows that a given state of affairs, such as ritual purity, existed at some point in the past but one has no evidence one way or the other whether it exists now, one can presume that the situation has not changed.&lt;ref&gt;One can compare, in Western legal systems, the presumption of innocence and the presumption in favour of possession.  Similarly Catholic moral theology distinguishes between "direct principles" and "reflex principles", the latter being the equivalent of [[Murtada al-Ansari]]'s ''usul 'amaliyyah''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The analysis of probability forms a large part of the Shiite science of ''usul al-fiqh'', and was developed by [[Muhammad Baqir Behbahani]] (1706-1792) and Shaykh [[Murtada al-Ansari]] (died 1864). The only primary text on Shi'ite principles of jurisprudence in English is the translation of [[Muhammad Baqir as-Sadr]]'s ''Durus fi 'Ilm al-'Usul''.

====Parts of the Shiite Uşūl al-Fiqh ====
Discussions of this science are presented in various parts in the works of uşūl al-fiqh. However, the best division is presented by al-Muhaqqiq al-Isfahani (d. 1940) in his last course of teaching (as narrated by his great student Muhammad Rida al-Muzaffar in his Uşūl al-Fiqh, p. 11) according to which all uşūlī topics are discussed in the four following parts: Discussions of “terms,” of “intellectual implications,” of “the authority,” and of “practical principles.”
Discussions of terms deal with denotations and appearances of terms from a general aspect, such as appearance of the imperative in the obligation, that of the prohibition in the unlawfulness, and the like.
Discussions of intellectual implications survey implications of precepts even though such precepts may not be inferred from terms, such as discussing truthfulness of mutual implication of intellectual judgments and juristic precepts, of obligation of something necessitating obligation of its preliminaries (known as “the problem of preliminary of the mandatory act”), of obligation of something necessitating unlawfulness of its opposite (known as “the problem of the opposite”), of possibility of conjunction of the command and the prohibition, and so on.
Discussions of the authority investigate whether some specific thing is juristically treated as a proof; for instance, whether report of a single transmitter, appearances, appearances of the Quran, Sunna, consensus, intellect, and the like are authoritative proofs.
Discussions of practical principles deal with what the jurist refers to when he cannot find a persuasive proof, such as the principle of clearance from obligation, that of precaution, and so forth.

===Ismaili principles===
Most early Ismaili works within the field of the principles of jurisprudence were actually responses to Sunni works on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, pg. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Qadi al-Nu'man]]'s ''Differences Among the Schools of Law'' is most likely the first of such written responses.

'''Reading law''' is the method by which persons in [[common law]] countries, particularly the [[United States]], entered the [[Practice of law|legal profession]] before the advent of [[law school]]s. This usage specifically refers to a means of entering the profession (although in England it is still customary to say that a university undergraduate is "reading" a course, which may be law or any other). ''Reading the law'' consists of an extended [[internship]] or [[apprenticeship]] under the [[Tutor|tutelage]] or [[Mentorship|mentoring]] of an experienced [[lawyer]].  A small number of U.S. jurisdictions still permit this practice today.&lt;ref name="Adwar"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-become-an-attorney-without-law-school-2014-7 |title = There's A Way To Become An Attorney Without Setting Foot In Law School |publisher = ''[[Business Insider]]'' |first = Corey |last = Adwar |date = July 30, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===United States===

In [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial America]], as in [[History of the British Isles|Britain]] in that day, law schools did not exist at all until [[Litchfield Law School]] was founded in 1773. Within a few years following the [[American Revolution]], some universities such as the [[College of William and Mary]] and the [[University of Pennsylvania]] established a "Chair in Law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Albert J. |last = Harno |title = Legal Education in the United States: A Report Prepared for the Survey of the Legal Profession |year = 1953 |page = 23 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the holder of this position would be the sole purveyor of legal education for the institution, and would give lectures designed to supplement, rather than replace, an apprenticeship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harno|1953|p= 27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Even as a handful of law schools were established, they remained uncommon in the United States until the late nineteenth century. Most people who entered the legal profession did so through an [[apprenticeship]] which incorporated a period of study under the supervision of an experienced attorney. This usually encompassed the reading of the works considered at the time to be the most authoritative on the law, such as [[Edward Coke]]'s ''[[Institutes of the Lawes of England]]'', [[William Blackstone]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', and similar texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harno|1953|pp=19–20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scholastic independence of the law student is evident from the following advice of [[Abraham Lincoln]] to a young man in 1855:

{{quote|If you are absolutely determined to make a lawyer of yourself the thing is more than half done already. It is a small matter whether you read with any one or not. I did not read with any one. Get the books and read and study them in their every feature, and that is the main thing. It is no consequence to be in a large town while you are reading. I read at New Salem, which never had three hundred people in it. The books and your capacity for understanding them are just the same in all places. [...] Always bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed is more important than any other one thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Frederick James |last = Allen |title = The Law as a Vocation |year = 1919 |page = 25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Reading law to become an attorney would be the norm, until the 1890s, when the [[American Bar Association]] (which had been formed in 1878) began pressing states to limit admission to the Bar to those persons who had satisfactorily completed several years of post-graduate institutional instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harno|1953|pp=86–87}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, [[James F. Byrnes]] became the last (July 8, 1941) Justice appointed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] who had never attended college or law school, and he was the penultimate appointee who had been admitted to practice by reading law. Byrnes was followed by [[Robert H. Jackson]], who was commissioned just three days later (July 11, 1941) and had also been admitted to the practice of law by reading, although he had attended a law school for less than one year (instead of the customary three to four years, and had not graduated).

===Canada===

Unlike their U.S. counterparts, early lawyers of [[Canada]] did get some legal training, but not within a higher institution like a school. Following [[English language|English]] tradition, early Canadian lawyers trained by "learning law" through another lawyer. To practice fully, these legal students ([[articled clerk]]) are required to pass a bar exam and be admitted to the bar.

Reading law was also used in [[Ontario]] to train lawyers until 1949. People training to become lawyers need not attend school, but they were asked to apprentice or article with a practicing lawyer. Changes in the late 1940s ended the practice.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book |first = Philip James |last = Sworded |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=86Gb7BB20aUC&amp;lpg=PA181 |title = An Introduction to Canadian Law |year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Quebec]], civil law required formal education; and in [[Nova Scotia]], lawyers were trained by attending university.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

==Modern practice==
A small number of jurisdictions still permit this.  In the states of [[California]],&lt;ref name="Adwar"/&gt; [[Vermont]],&lt;ref name="Adwar"/&gt; [[Virginia]],&lt;ref name=va-reader&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.vbbe.state.va.us/reader/reader.html |title = Law Reader Program |year = 2010 |accessdate = January 6, 2010 |publisher = Virginia Board of Bar Examiners }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]],&lt;ref name=wa-rule6&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wsba.org/~/media/Files/Licensing_Lawyer%20Conduct/Admissions/Special%20Admissions/APR%206%20Rules%20and%20Regulations.ashx=Rule%206%20Law%20Clerk%20Program |title = Rules and Regulations Governing the Washington Law Clerk Program |year = 2002 |accessdate = March 4, 2007 |publisher = Washington State Bar Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; an applicant who has not attended law school may take the bar exam after reading law under a judge or practicing attorney for an extended period of time. The required time varies. Exact rules vary as well; for example, Virginia does not allow the reader to be gainfully employed by the tutoring lawyer, while Washington requires just that. The State of [[New York (state)|New York]] requires that applicants who are reading law must have at least one year of law school study&lt;ref name=ny-bar-rule520&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.nybarexam.org/Rules/Rules.htm#520.4 |title = New York Rules of the Court of Appeals for the Admission of Attorneys |year = 2000 |accessdate = January 20, 2011 |publisher = New York State Board of Bar Examiners }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maine]] requires applicants to have completed at least two-thirds of a law degree.&lt;ref name=maine-bar&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.mainebarexaminers.org/PDF/MBAR0109.pdf |title = Maine Bar Admission Rules |year = 2009 |accessdate = January 20, 2011 |publisher = Maine Board of Bar Examiners |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110727055410/http://www.mainebarexaminers.org/PDF/MBAR0109.pdf |archivedate = July 27, 2011 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such persons are sometimes called [[country lawyer]]s or county-seat lawyers.  In 2013, 60 people became lawyers this way as opposed to 84,000 via law schools.&lt;REF name="Adwar"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1855">{{capitalism}}
The term '''regulatory capitalism''' suggests that the operation maintenance and development of the [[International political economy|global political economy]] increasingly depends on administrative rules outside the legislatures and the courts.

The general trend despite and beyond the process of [[liberalization]] is that of growth rather than decline of [[regulation]]. [[Deregulation]] may represent trends in some industries (notably finance), but more regulation is the general trend beyond that characterize modern and post-modern capitalism alike.&lt;ref&gt;[[Levi-Faur, David]], ''The Global Diffusion of Regulatory Capitalism'', The ANNALS of the [[American Academy of Political and Social Science]], March 2005, vol. 598, no. 1, pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Regulation in this interpretation is an instrument of organizations—states, business, civil and hybrid and is carried at all political arenas and levels.

The concept of regulatory capitalism serves as an alternative to concepts like [[financial capitalism]], [[welfare capitalism]], [[Casino Capitalism|casino capitalism]], [[developmental capitalism]], [[risk capitalism]], [[state capitalism]] and [[crony capitalism]] in an attempt to shed more light on capitalism as a polymorphous order.

{{Forms of government}}
The '''rule according to a higher law''' means that no law may be enforced by the government unless it conforms with certain universal principles (written or unwritten) of fairness, morality, and justice.&lt;ref&gt;West's Encyclopedia of American Law (in 13 volumes), 2nd Ed., edited by Jeffrey Lehman and Shirelle Phelps. Publisher: Thomson Gale, 2004. {{ISBN|0-7876-6367-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, ''the rule according to a higher law'' may serve as a practical legal criterion to qualify the instances of political or economical decision-making, when a [[government]], even though acting in conformity with clearly defined and properly enacted legal [[Law|rules]], still produces results which many observers find unfair or unjust.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mortimer Sellers|M.N.S. Sellers]], ''Republican Legal Theory: The History, Constitution and Purposes of Law in a Free State'', Basingstoke, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The idea of a law of ultimate justice over and above the momentary law of the state—a higher law—was first introduced into post-Roman Europe by the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic canon law]] jurists.&lt;ref&gt;Wormser, ''The Story of the LAW'', pg. 189&lt;/ref&gt; "Higher law" can be interpreted in this context as the [[divine law|divine]] or [[natural law]] or basic legal values, established in the [[international law]] – the choice depending on the viewpoint. But this is definitely a Law above the law.&lt;ref&gt;Edward S. Corwin, ''The “Higher Law” Background of American Constitutional Law'' (1955).&lt;/ref&gt; And it is in this capacity that it possesses the equal legal value for both the [[common law|common]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, as opposed to natural law which is largely associated with common law.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie F. Goldstein, ''Popular Sovereignty, the Origins of Judicial Review, and the Revival of Unwritten Law'', Journal of Politics 48 (1986): 51–71&lt;/ref&gt; "To recognize the necessary connection between the rule of law as an ideal and well-constructed constitutional government does not and should not be taken to imply that all states can or should maintain the same constitutional structures in practice".&lt;ref&gt;[[Mortimer Sellers]], ''An Introduction. The Rule of Law in Comparative Perspectives'', edited by [[Mortimer Sellers]] and Tadeusz Tomaszewski, Springer, Heidelberg – London – New York, 2010, pp. 4–5. {{ISBN|978-90-481-3749-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The rule according to higher law'' is a practical approach to the implementation of the higher law theory which creates a bridge of mutual understanding (with regard to universal legal values) between the English language doctrine of the [[rule of law]], traditional for the countries of common law, and the originally German doctrine of ''[[Rechtsstaat]]'', translated into other languages of continental Europe as ''État de droit'' (Fr.), ''Estado de derecho'' (Sp.), ''Stato di diritto'' (It.), and ''Правовое государство'' (Ru.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/75th_Anniversary_of_Roerich_Pact_Eng.html Peter Barenboim, Naeem Sidiqi, ''Bruges, the Bridge between Civilizations: The 75 Anniversary of the Roerich Pact, Grid Belgium, 2010]. {{ISBN|978-5-98856-114-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter doctrine is the product of continental European legal thought which had adopted it from German legal philosophy. Its name can be translated into English as "state of law" —meaning the state in which the exercise of governmental power is kept in check by the higher law rather than by the changeable law established by this state.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} [[Amartya Sen]] mentioned that the legal theorists in ancient India used term of classical Sanskrit "nyāya" in the sense of not just a matter of judging institutions and rules, but of judging the societies themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Amartya Sen, ''Global justice'' in ''Global Perspectives on the Rule of Law'', edited by [[James J. Heckman]], Robert L. Nelson, Lee Cabating and Paul Lepore, Routledge, London and New York, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Before the [[American Civil War|U.S. Civil War]], [[African American]]s were legally denied equal rights and freedoms pursuant to formally valid codes prescribing the relations between master and slave. Although these codes were ''de jure'' fully suitable for application in legal practice, their enforcement by the then U.S. government ''de facto'' violated basic human rights of a significant part of the population. [[William H. Seward]] famously proclaimed that slavery is forbidden under "a higher law than the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]]."

Generally speaking, the occurrence of such "justly enacted unjust laws" fully depends on the stance taken by the country's political leadership towards [[the rule of law]] principle.

In some countries, the political leaders assert that the rule of law is purely a procedural concept. Therefore, they argue that any government may strip its subjects of their fundamental freedoms or infringe their vital interests so long as this is done by way of a duly implemented legal mechanism. For example, at the [[Nuremberg trials]], in an attempt to justify their crimes against Jewish and Romany population of Europe during [[World War II]], some of the former leaders of [[Nazi Germany]] argued that they had broken none of the laws effective when Hitler had been in power. It was only by invoking the rule according to a higher law that the Allied prosecutors were able to overcome such defenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://untreaty.un.org/cod/avl/ha/ga_95-I/ga_95-I.html Introductory note by Antonio Cassese] for General Assembly resolution 95(I) of 11 December 1946 (Affirmation of the Principles of International Law recognized by the Charter of the Nürnberg Tribunal) on the website of the [https://www.un.org/law/avl/ UN Audiovisual Library of International Law]&lt;/ref&gt;

In other countries, conversely, the political leaders assert that all written laws must be kept in line with the universal principles of morality, fairness, and justice. These leaders argue that, as a necessary corollary to the axiom that "no one is above the law," the rule of law requires the government to treat all persons equally under the law. However, the proclaimed right to equal treatment is susceptible to instantly becoming void each time the government denies a sufficient level of respect, dignity, and autonomy to a certain class of individuals or to human rights in general."&lt;ref&gt;Augusto Zimmermann, ''Constitutions Without Constitutionalism: The Failure of Constitutionalism in Brazil, The Rule of Law in Comparative Perspectives'', edited by [[Mortimer Sellers]] and Tadeusz Tomaszewski, Springer, Heidelberg – London – New York, 2010, p.101. {{ISBN|978-90-481-3749-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Therefore, the unwritten and universally self-explanatory principles of equality, autonomy, dignity, and respect are said to overrule conventional written laws enacted by the government. It is these principles that are often referred to as "natural law." They also constitute the basis of the "higher law theory".

==''Rechtsstaat''==
The ''[[Rechtsstaat]]'' doctrine (legal state, state of right, constitutional state, constitutional government) was first introduced by the German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] in his latest works completed after the U.S. and French constitutions had been adopted in the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|authorlink=Friedrich Hayek|title=[[The Constitution of Liberty]]|location=London|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|date=1960|pages=196-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kant’s approach is based on the supremacy of country’s written [[constitution]] created using principles of the Higher Law. This supremacy meant creating guarantees for the implementation of his central idea: a permanently peaceful life as a basic condition for the happiness and prosperity of the citizens. Kant was basing his doctrine exclusively on the idea of constitutionalism and constitutional government.

The Russian legal system, born in the 19th century as a result of the transformations initiated by the reforms of the [[Alexander II of Russia|Emperor Alexander II]], was (and still is) based primarily upon the German legal tradition. It was from the latter that Russia had adopted the doctrine of ''Rechtsstaat'', which literally translates as "Legal State." Its closest English analogue is "the rule of law."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, ''Defining the rules'', ''The European Lawyer'', Issue 90, October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian Legal state concept adopts the written constitution as the country's supreme law (the rule of constitution). It is a fundamental but undefined principle that appears in the very first dispositive provision of Russia’s post-Communist constitution: "The Russian Federation – Russia – constitutes a democratic federative legal state with a republican form of governance." Similarly, the very first dispositive provision of Ukraine’s Constitution declares that "Ukraine is a sovereign and independent, democratic, social, legal state." Hence, the effort to invest meaning to the "Legal State" definition is anything but theoretical.

[[Valery Zorkin]], President of the Constitutional Court of Russia, wrote in 2003, "Becoming a legal state has long been our ultimate goal, and we have certainly made serious progress in this direction over the past several years. However, no one can say now that we have reached this destination. Such a legal state simply cannot exist without a lawful and just society. Here, as in no other sphere of our life, the state reflects the level of maturity reached by the society."&lt;ref&gt;''The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform'', edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian concept of Legal state has adopted many segments of [[constitutional economics]] which serves as a practical implementation of the higher law theory in economics.

Economist [[James M. Buchanan]] argues that, in the framework of constitutional government, any governmental intervention or regulation must be conditioned by the three following assumptions. First, every failure of the market economy to function smoothly and perfectly can be corrected by governmental intervention. Second, those holding political office and manning the bureaucracies are altruistic upholders of the public interest, unconcerned with their own personal economic well-being. And third, changing the government responsibilities towards more intervention and control will not profoundly and perversely affect the social and economic life.

Buchanan rejects "any organic conception of the [[state (polity)|state]] as superior in wisdom, to the individuals who are its members." This philosophical position is, in fact, the very subject matter of constitutional economics. A constitutional economics approach allows for a combined economic and constitutional analysis, helping to avoid a one-dimensional understanding. Buchanan, together with Kant, believes that a [[constitution]] in its capacity as the Higher Law, intended for use by at least several generations of citizens, must be able to adjust itself for pragmatic economic decisions, while balancing interests of the state and society against those of individuals, with their constitutional rights to personal freedom and private happiness.

Buchanan also outlines importance of protection of the moral principles underlying constitutional norms. He writes that "the ethics of constitutional citizenship is not directly comparable to ethical behavior in interaction with other persons within the constraints imposed by the rules of an existing regime. An individual may be fully responsible, in the standard ethical sense, and yet fail to meet the ethical requirement of constitutional citizenship."&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, J., ''Logical Formulations of Constitutional Liberty'', Vol. 1., Indianapolis, 1999. P. 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''sociology of law''' (or '''legal sociology''') is often described as a sub-discipline of [[sociology]] or an interdisciplinary approach within [[jurisprudence|legal studies]].&lt;ref&gt;For various definitions of the sociology of law,see Ehrlich 1936 (orig 1912); Timasheff 1939; Pound 1943; Selznick 1965, Aubert 1969 and 1980, Black 1972, Stjernquist 1983, Hydén 1986, Tomasic 1987, Ferrari 1989, Podgorecki 1991, Cotterrell 1992, Banakar 2003 and 2011; Mathiesen 2005, Deflem 2008, Travers 2009, Nelken 2009, Scuro 2010, Banakar and Travers 2013, Banakar 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Some see sociology of law as belonging "necessarily" to the field of sociology,&lt;ref&gt;See Deflem 2008:3.&lt;/ref&gt; but others tend to consider it a field of research caught up between the disciplines of [[law]] and sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2003 and 2009, Banakar and Travers 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Still others regard it neither a subdiscipline of sociology nor a branch of legal studies but as a field of research on its own right within the broader social science tradition. Accordingly, it may be described without reference to mainstream sociology as "the systematic, theoretically grounded, empirical study of law as a set of social practices or as an aspect or field of social experience".&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been seen as treating law and justice as fundamental institutions of the basic structure of society mediating "between political and economic interests, between culture and the normative order of society, establishing and maintaining interdependence, and constituting themselves as sources of consensus, coercion and social control".&lt;ref&gt;Scuro 2010: 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irrespective of whether sociology of law is defined as a sub-discipline of sociology, an approach within legal studies or a field of research in its own right, it remains intellectually dependent mainly on the traditions, methods and theories of mainstream [[sociology]] and, to a lesser extent, on other [[social sciences]] such as [[social anthropology]], [[political science]], [[social policy]], [[criminology]] and [[psychology]]. As such, it reflects social theories and employs social scientific methods to study [[law]], [[legal institutions]] and legal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar and Travers 2005, pp. 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, sociology of law consists of various approaches to the study of law in society, which empirically examine and theorise the interaction between law, legal, non-legal institutions and social factors.&lt;ref&gt;See Black 1976; Cotterrell 1992; Hunt 1993; Santos 2002; Banakar 2003; Banakar and Travers 2002; Ferrari 1989; Luhmann 1985; Trevino 2008; Travers 2009, Nelken 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Areas of socio-legal inquiry include the social development of legal institutions, forms of [[social control]], legal [[regulation]], the interaction between [[legal culture]]s, the social construction of legal issues, [[legal profession]] and the relation between law and [[social change]].

Sociology of law also benefits from and occasionally draws on research conducted within other fields such as [[comparative law]], [[critical legal studies]], [[jurisprudence]], [[legal theory]], [[law and economics]] and [[law and literature]]. Its object encompasses the historical movement of law and justice and their relentless contemporary construction such as in the field of jurisprudence focused on institutional questions conditioned by social and political situations, in interdisciplinary dominions such as criminology and through analysis of the economic efficiency and the social impact of legal norms.&lt;ref&gt;Scuro 2010: 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual origins==
[[File:Veber.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Max Weber]]]]
The roots of the sociology of law can be traced back to the works of sociologists and jurists of the turn of the previous century. The relationship between law and society was sociologically explored in the seminal works of both [[Max Weber]] and [[Émile Durkheim]]. The writings on law by these classical sociologists are foundational to the entire sociology of law today.&lt;ref&gt;Deflem, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other scholars, mainly jurists, also employed social scientific theories and methods in an attempt to develop sociological theories of law. Notably among these were [[Leon Petrazycki]], [[Eugen Ehrlich]] and [[Georges Gurvitch]].

For [[Max Weber]], a so-called "legal rational form" as a type of domination within society, is not attributable to people but to abstract norms.&lt;ref&gt;Rheinstein, ''Max Weber on Law and Economy in Society'', 336&lt;/ref&gt; He understood the body of coherent and calculable law in terms of a [[rational-legal authority]]. Such coherent and calculable law formed a precondition for modern political developments and the modern bureaucratic state and developed in parallel with the growth of [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jary, ''Collins Dictionary of Sociology'', 636&lt;/ref&gt; Central to the development of modern law is the formal rationalisation of law on the basis of general procedures that are applied equally and fairly to all. Modern rationalised law is also codified and impersonal in its application to specific cases. In general, Weber's standpoint can be described as an external approach to law that studies the empirical characteristics of law, as opposed to the internal perspective of the legal sciences and the moral approach of the philosophy of law.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on Weber's typology see Kronman 1983: 8-14.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Émile Durkheim]]]]
[[Émile Durkheim]] wrote in ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'' that as society becomes more complex, the body of civil law concerned primarily with [[restitution]] and [[damages|compensation]] grows at the expense of criminal laws and penal sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Sociology, 156&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, law has undergone a transformation from repressive law to restitutive law. Restitutive law operates in societies in which there is a high degree of individual variation and emphasis on personal rights and responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; For Durkheim, law is an indicator of the mode of integration of a society, which can be mechanical, among identical parts, or organic, among differentiated parts such as in industrialized societies. Durkheim also argued that a sociology of law should be developed alongside, and in close connection with, a sociology of morals, studying the development of value systems reflected in law.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed discussion of [[Durkheim|Durkheim's]] sociology of law see Cotterrell 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Fundamental Principles of the Sociology of Law'', [[Eugen Ehrlich]] developed a sociological approach to the study of law by focusing on how social networks and groups organized social life.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich 1936 (orig. 1912).&lt;/ref&gt; He explored the relationship between law and general social norms and distinguished between "positive law," consisting of the compulsive norms of state requiring official enforcement, and "living law," consisting of the rules of conduct that people in fact obeyed and which dominated social life. The latter emerged spontaneously as people interacted with each other to form social associations.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegert 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The centre of gravity of legal development therefore from time immemorial has not lain in the activity of the state, but in society itself, and must be sought there at the present time".|Eugen Ehrlich, ''Fundamental Principles of the Sociology of Law''&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, 1936: 390.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This was subjected to criticism by the advocates of legal positivism such as the jurist [[Hans Kelsen]] for its distinction between "law created by the state and law produced by the organisational imperatives of non-state social associations".&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion see Banakar 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kelsen, Ehrlich had confused ''Sein'' ("is") and ''Sollen'' ("ought").&lt;ref&gt;For a presentation of this debate and references to the original sources of the debate see van Klink 2006. For an analysis of the debate between Kelsen and Ehrlich see Banakar 2008. Banakar argues that Kelsen could not help but miss the point that Ehrlich was making by his distinction.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some argued that Ehrlich was distinguishing between positive (or state) law, which lawyers learn and apply, and other forms of 'law', what Ehrlich called "living law", that regulate everyday life, generally preventing conflicts from reaching lawyers and courts.&lt;ref&gt;Rottleuthner, ''La Sociologie du Droit en Allemagne'', 109&lt;br&gt;* Rottleuthner, ''Rechtstheoritische Probleme der Sociologie des Rechts'', 521&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leon Petrazycki ii.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Leon Petrazycki]]]]
[[Leon Petrazycki]] distinguished between forms of "official law," supported by the state, and "intuitive law," consisting of legal experiences that, in turn, consist of a complex of psychic processes in the mind of the individual with no reference to outside authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Petrazycki1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Petrazycki's work addressed sociological problems and his method was empirical, since he maintained that one could gain knowledge of objects or relationships only by observation. However, he couched his theory in the language of cognitive psychology and moral philosophy rather than sociology. Consequently, his contribution to the development of sociology of law remains largely unrecognized.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2006; also see Podgórecki 1980; Kurczewski 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Petrazycki's "intuitive law" influenced not only the development of Georges Gurvitch's concept of "social law" (see below), which in turn has left its mark on socio-legal theorising, but also the work of later socio-legal scholars. Among those who were directly inspired by Petrazycki's work is the Polish legal sociologist [[Adam Podgórecki]].&lt;ref&gt;See Podgórecki 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodor Geiger]] developed a close-knit analysis of the Marxist theory of law. He highlighted how law becomes a "factor in social transformation in democratic societies of the kind that are governed by the consent expressed by universal suffrage of the population practised at regular intervals".&lt;ref&gt;Ghezzi 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Geiger went on to develop the salient characteristics of his antimetaphysical thinking, until he exceeded it with practical [[nihilism]]. Geiger's nihilism of values paved the way for a form of [[legal nihilism]], which encourages the construction of a sober democracy "that is capable of raising conflict to the intellectual level and of anaesthetising feelings, as it is aware of its own inability to make any proclamation of value, ethics or policy about the nature of truth".&lt;ref&gt;Ghezzi 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georges Gurvitch]] was interested in the fusion of simultaneous manifestation of law in various forms and at various levels of social interaction. His aim was to devise the concept of "social law" as a law of integration and cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;see Gurvitch, Georges, ''L'idée du droit social'' (1932)&lt;/ref&gt; Gurvitch's social law was an integral part of his general sociology. "It is also one of the early sociological contributions to the theory of legal pluralism, since it challenged all conceptions of law based on a single source of legal, political, or moral authority".&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a discipline, the sociology of law had an early reception in Argentina. As a local movement of legal scholars steeming from the work of Carlos Cossio, South American researchers have focused on comparative law and sociological insights, constitutional law and society, human rights, and psycho-social approaches to the legal practices.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview, see Lista, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociological approaches to the study of law==

===Modern sociology of law===
The sociology of law became clearly established as an academic field of learning and empirical research after the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on the emergence of the "sociological movement" in law after World War II see Deflem 2009: 1.&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II, the study of law was not central in sociology, although some well-known sociologists did write about the role of law in society. In the work of [[Talcott Parsons]], for instance, law is conceived as an essential mechanism of social control.&lt;ref&gt;Trevino, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the criticisms that were developed against functionalism, other sociological perspectives of law emerged. Critical sociologists,&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion see Cotterrell 1992: 122-3&lt;/ref&gt;  developed a perspective of law as an instrument of power. However, other theorists in the sociology of law, such as [[Philip Selznick]], argued that modern law became increasingly responsive to a society's needs and had to be approached morally as well.&lt;ref&gt;Selznik, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Still other scholars, most notably the American sociologist [[Donald Black (sociologist)|Donald Black]], developed a resolutely scientific theory of law on the basis of a paradigm of [[pure sociology]]. Equally broad in orientation, but again different, is the [[autopoietic system]]s theory of the German sociologist [[Niklas Luhmann]], who presents law or "the legal system" as one of the ten ''function systems'' (see [[Differentiation (sociology)|functional differentiation]]) of society.&lt;ref&gt;See Luhmann 2004 and 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roth and Schutz 2015"&gt;[[Steffen Roth]] and Anton Schutz: ''Ten systems. Toward a canon of function systems.'' In: ''Cybernetics and Human Knowing'', Vol. 22, No. 4., 2015. Vorversion verfügbar (englisch; [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2508950 online] auf ssrn.com).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|All collective human life is directly or indirectly shaped by law. Law is like knowledge, an essential and all-pervasive fact of the social condition.|Niklas Luhmann, ''A Sociological Theory of Law''&lt;ref&gt;Niklas Luhmann, 1985: 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Social philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]] disagrees with Luhmann and argues that the law can do a better job as a 'system' institution' by representing more faithfully the interests of everyday people in the 'lifeworld'. Yet another sociological theory of law and lawyers is that of [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and his followers, who see law as a social field in which actors struggle for cultural, symbolic and economic capital and in so doing develop the reproductive professional ''habitus'' of the lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Dezalay and Garth 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In several continental European countries empirical research in sociology of law developed strongly from the 1960s and 1970s. In Poland the work of [[Adam Podgórecki]] and his associates (often influenced by [[Petrazycki]]'s ideas) was especially notable; in Sweden empirical research in sociology of law in this period was pioneered especially by [[Per Stjernquist]], and in Norway by [[Vilhelm Aubert]].

In more recent years, a very wide range of theories has emerged in the sociology of law as a result of the proliferation of theories in sociology at large. Among the recent influences can be mentioned the work of the French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]], the German social theorist [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[feminism]], [[postmodernism]] and [[deconstruction]], [[neo-Marxism]], and [[behaviorism]]. The variety of theoretical influences in the sociology of law has also marked the broader law and society field. The multi-disciplinary law and society field remains very popular, while the disciplinary speciality field of the sociology of law is also "better organized than ever in institutional and professional respects".&lt;ref&gt;Deflem 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law and Society===
Law and Society is an American movement, which was established after the Second World War through the initiative mainly of sociologists who had a vested interest in the study of law.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale of the Law and Society movement is subtly summed up in two short sentences by [[Lawrence Friedman]]: "Law is a massive vital presence in the United States. It is too important to be left to lawyers".&lt;ref&gt;Friedman 1986:780.&lt;/ref&gt; Its founders believed that the "study of law and legal institutions in their social context could be constituted as a scholarly field distinguished by its commitment to interdisciplinary dialogue and multidisciplinary research methods".&lt;ref&gt;Austin et al, 1998:2.&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of the [[Law and Society Association]] in 1964 and of the ''Law and Society Review'' in 1966 guaranteed continuity in the scholarly activities of the Law and Society movement and allowed its members to influence legal education and policy-making in the US.&lt;ref&gt;See Munger 1998 and Simon 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

On one view, the main difference between the sociology of law and Law and Society is that the latter does not limit itself theoretically or methodologically to sociology and tries instead to accommodate insights from all social science disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;For an example see Friedman 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; "Not only does it provides a home for sociologists and social anthropologists and political scientists with an interest in law, it also tries to incorporate psychologists and economists who study law."&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion see Banakar 2009&lt;/ref&gt; From another point of view, both sociology of law and Law and Society should be seen as multi-disciplinary or trans-disciplinary enterprises although sociology of law has special ties to the methods, theories and traditions of sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s and 1980s a number of original empirical studies were conducted by Law and Society scholars on conflict and dispute resolution. In his early work, [[Bill Felstiner|William Felstiner]], for example, focused on alternative ways to solve conflicts (avoidance, mediation, litigation etc.). Together with [[Richard Abel (lawyer)|Richard Abel]] and [[Austin Sarat]], Felstiner developed the idea of a disputes pyramid and the formula "naming, blaming, claiming", which refers to different stages of conflict resolution and levels of the pyramid.&lt;ref&gt;"See, Felstiner, Abel and Sarat 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociological jurisprudence===
The sociology of law is often distinguished from sociological jurisprudence. The latter is not primarily concerned with debates within mainstream sociology and instead engages with some of the debates within jurisprudence and legal theory. Sociological jurisprudence seeks to base legal arguments on sociological insights and, unlike legal theory, is concerned with the mundane practices that create legal institutions and social operations which reproduce legal systems over time. It was developed in the United States by [[Louis Brandeis]] and [[Roscoe Pound]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Faigman|first=David L.|title=Laboratory of Justice: The Supreme Court's 200-Year Struggle to Integrate Science and the Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UsMjpPS5AXoC&amp;pg=PA97|year=2005|publisher=Henry Holt |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pound, Roscoe. "Scope and Purpose of Sociological Jurisprudence." ''Harv. L. Rev.'' 24 (1910): 591. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1324392]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilfrid E. Rumble, Jr., "Legal Realism, Sociological Jurisprudence and Mr. Justice Holmes," ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' (1965) 26#4 pp. 547-566 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2708499 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; It was influenced by the work of pioneer legal sociologists, such as the Austrian jurist [[Eugen Ehrlich]] and the Russian-French sociologist [[Georges Gurvitch]].&lt;ref&gt;See Banakar 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Although distinguishing between different branches of the social scientific studies of law allows us to explain and analyse the development of the sociology of law in relation to mainstream sociology and legal studies, such potentially artificial distinctions are not necessarily fruitful for the development of the field as whole. For the social scientific studies of law to transcend the theoretical and empirical limits, which currently define their scope, they need to go beyond such artificial distinctions.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socio-legal studies==
'Socio-legal studies' in the UK has grown mainly out of the interest of law schools in promoting interdisciplinary studies of law.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Whether regarded as an emerging discipline, sub-discipline or a methodological approach, it is often viewed in light of its relationship to, and oppositional role within, law.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; It should not, therefore, be confused with the legal sociology of many West European countries or the Law and Society scholarship in the US, which foster much stronger disciplinary ties with social sciences. In the past, it has been presented as the applied branch of the sociology of law and criticised for being empiricist and atheoretical.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Max Travers, for example, regards socio-legal studies as a subfield of social policy, 'mainly concerned with influencing or serving government policy in the provision of legal services'&lt;ref&gt;Travers 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and adds that it "has given up any aspirations it once had to develop general theories about the policy process".&lt;ref&gt;Travers 2001: 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable practitioners of socio-legal studies include [[Carol Smart|Professor Carol Smart]], co-director of the [[Arthur Lewis Building#External links|Morgan Centre for the Study of Relationships and Personal Life]], (named after the sociologist, [[David Morgan (sociologist)|David Morgan]]), as well as [[Mavis Maclean|Professor Mavis Maclean]] and [[John Eekelaar]] who are joint directors of the Oxford Centre for Family Law and Policy (OXFLAP).

'''Socio-legal methods of investigation'''

The sociology of law has no methods of investigation which have been developed specifically for conducting socio-legal research. Instead, it employs a wide variety of social scientific methods, including qualitative and quantitative research techniques, to explore law and legal phenomena. Positivistic&lt;ref&gt;See Black 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as interpretive (such as discourse analysis) and ethnographic&lt;ref&gt;See Travers 1997, Flood 2005 and 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; approaches to data collection and analysis is used within the socio-legal field.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of various methods see Banakar and Travers 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology of law in Britain==
Sociology of law was a small, but developing, sub-field of British sociology and legal scholarship at the time when Campbell and Wiles wrote their review of law and society research in 1976. Unfortunately, despite its initial promise, it has remained a small field. Very few empirical sociological studies are published each year. Nevertheless, there have been some excellent studies, representing a variety of sociological traditions as well as some major theoretical contributions. The two most popular approaches during the 1960s and 1970s were interactionism and Marxism.

'''Symbolic interactionism and Marxism'''

[[Symbolic interactionism|Interactionism]] had become popular in America in the 1950s and 1960s as a politically radical alternative to structural-functionalism. Instead of viewing society as a system regulating and controlling the actions of individuals, interactionists argued that sociology should address what people were doing in particular situations, and how they understood their own actions.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Becker 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; The sociology of deviance, which included topics such as crime, homosexuality, and mental illness, became the focus for these theoretical debates. Functionalists had portrayed crime as a problem to be managed by the legal system. Labeling theorists, by contrast, focused on the process of law-making and enforcement: how crime was constructed as a problem. A number of British sociologists, and some researchers in law schools, have drawn on these ideas in writing about law and crime.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Paterson 1982; Flood 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most influential sociological approach during this period was, however, Marxism—which claimed to offer a scientific and comprehensive understanding of society as a whole in the same way as structural-functionalism, although with the emphasis on the struggle between different groups for material advantage, rather than value-consensus. This approach caught the imagination of many people with left-wing political views in law schools, but it also generated some interesting empirical studies. These included historical studies about how particular
statutes were used to advance the interests of dominant economic groups, and also Pat Carlen's memorable ethnography,&lt;ref&gt;Pat Carlen 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; which combined analytic resources from Marxism and interactionism, especially the sociology of Erving Goffman, in writing about magistrates' courts.

'''The Oxford Centre for Socio-Legal Studies'''

The 1980s were also a fruitful time for empirical sociology of law in Britain, mainly
because Donald Harris deliberately set out to create the conditions for a fruitful
exchange between lawyers and sociologists at the [[University of Oxford]] Centre for Socio-Legal Studies. He was fortunate enough to recruit a number of young and
talented social scientists, including J. Maxwell Atkinson and Robert Dingwall who were interested in ethnomethodology, conversation analysis, and the sociology
of the professions, and Doreen McBarnet who became something of a cult figure on the left after publishing her doctoral thesis,&lt;ref&gt;Doreen McBarnet 1981&lt;/ref&gt; which advanced a particularly clear and vigorous Marxist analysis of the criminal justice system. Ethnomethodology has not previously been mentioned in this review, and tends to be overlooked by many reviewers in this field since it cannot easily be assimilated to their theoretical interests. One can note, however, that it has always offered a more radical and thorough-going way of theorizing action than interactionism (although the two approaches have a lot in common when compared to traditions that view society as a structural whole, like Marxism or structural-functionalism). During his time at the center, J. Maxwell Atkinson collaborated with Paul Drew, a sociologist at the University of York, in what became the first conversation analytic study of courtroom interaction, using transcripts of coroner's hearings in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson and Drew, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

Another area of interest developed at Oxford during this period was the sociology of the professions. Robert Dingwall and Philip Lewis&lt;ref&gt;Robert Dingwall and Philip Lewis 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; edited what remains an interesting and theoretically diverse collection, bringing together specialists from the sociology of law and medicine. The best known study to date has, however, been published by the American scholar [[Richard Abel (lawyer)|Richard Abel]]&lt;ref&gt;Abel 1988&lt;/ref&gt; who employed ideas and concepts from functionalist, Marxist, and Weberian
sociology to explain the high incomes and status that British lawyers enjoyed for most of the twentieth century.

'''Recent developments'''

Since the 1980s, relatively few empirical studies of law and legal institutions have been conducted by British sociologists, i.e. studies which are empirical and at the same time engage with the theoretical concerns of sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Travers 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, some exceptions. To begin with, sociology of law, along with so many areas of academic work, has been enlivened and renewed through engagement with feminism. There has been a great deal of
interest in the implications of Foucault's ideas on governmentality for understanding
law,&lt;ref&gt;Hunt and Wickham 1994&lt;/ref&gt; and also in continental thinkers such as Niklas Luhmann and Pierre Bourdieu. Again, one can argue that rather fewer empirical studies have been produced than one might have hoped, but a great deal of interesting work has been published.

A second exception is to be found in the works of researchers who have employed resources from ethnomethodology and symbolic interactionism in studying legal settings.&lt;ref&gt;Travers 1997; 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of research is clearly sociological rather than socio-legal research because it continually engages in debate with other theoretical traditions in sociology. Max Travers' doctoral thesis about the work of a firm of criminal lawyers took other sociologists, and especially Marxists, to task for not addressing or respecting how lawyers and clients understand their own actions (a standard argument used by ethnomethodologists in debates with structural traditions in the discipline). It also, however, explored issues raised by legal thinkers in their critique of structural traditions in sociology of law: the extent to which social science can address the content of legal practice.

Despite the relatively limited developments in recent empirical research, theoretical debates in sociology of law have been important in British literature during recent decades, with contributions from [[David Nelken]] exploring the problems of a comparative sociology of law and the potential of the idea of legal cultures,&lt;ref&gt;Nelken 2004; 2007; 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Cotterrell]] seeking to develop a new view of the relations of law and community to replace what he sees as outdated 'law and society' paradigms,&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2006; 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and other scholars, such as [[David Schiff]] and Richard Nobles, examining the potential of Luhmannian systems theory and the extent to which law can be seen as an autonomous social field rather than as intimately interrelated with other aspects of the social.&lt;ref&gt;Nobles and Schiff 2006; 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Also significant has been the burgeoning field of socio-legal research on regulation and government,{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} to which British scholars have been prominent contributors.

==Devising a sociological concept of law==
In contrast to the traditional understanding of law (see the separate entry on [[law]]), the sociology of law does not normally view and define the law only as a system of rules, doctrine and decisions, which exist independently of the society out of which it has emerged. The rule-based aspect of law is, admittedly, important, but provides an inadequate basis for describing, analysing and understanding law in its societal context.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2009; Nelken 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, legal sociology regards law as a set of institutional practices which have evolved over time and developed in relation to, and through interaction with, cultural, economic and socio-political structures and institutions. As a modern social system, law does strive to gain and retain its autonomy to function independently of other social institutions and systems such as religion, polity and economy. Yet, it remains historically and functionally linked to these other institutions. Thus, one of the objectives of the sociology of law remains to devise empirical methodologies capable of describing and explaining modern law's interdependence with other social institutions.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion see Banakar and Travers 2005 and Banakar 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some influential approaches within the sociology of law have challenged definitions of law in terms of official (state) law (see for example [[Eugen Ehrlich]]'s concept of "living law" and [[Georges Gurvitch]]'s "social law"). From this standpoint, law is understood broadly to include not only the legal system and formal (or official) legal institutions and processes, but also various informal (or unofficial) forms of nomativity and regulation which are generated within groups, associations and communities. The sociological studies of law are, thus, not limited to analysing how the rules or institutions of the legal system interact with social class, gender, race, religion, sexuality and other social categories. They also focus on how the internal normative orderings of various groups and "communities", such as the community of lawyers, businessmen, scientists, members of political parties, or members of the Mafia, interact with each other. In short, law is studied as an integral and constitutive part of social institutions, groupings and communities. This approach is developed further under the section on legal pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;For studies of legal pluralism see Dalberg-Larsen 2000; Merry 1988; Chiba 1989; John Griffiths 1986; Olgiati 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Western sociology of law==

The interest in the sociology of law continues to be more widespread in Western countries. Some important research has been produced by Indian scholars,&lt;ref&gt;Deva, 2005; Baxi, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; but we find only a limited amount of socio-legal work by researchers from, for example, the Middle East or central and northern parts of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;For an earlier overview of the field, see Ferrari, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the global spread of sociological studies of law appears uneven and concentrated, above all, in industrialised nations with democratic political systems. In this sense, the global expansion of legal sociology “is not taking place uniformly across national boundaries and appears to correlate with a combination of factors such as national wealth/poverty and form of political organisation, as well as historical factors such as the growth of the welfare state... However, none of these factors alone can explain this disparity”.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on the disparity between Western and non-Western sociology of law see Banakar 2011 at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1761466&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary perspectives==

===Legal pluralism===
[[Legal pluralism]] is a concept developed by legal sociologists and social anthropologists "to describe multiple layers of law, usually with different sources of legitimacy, that exist within a single state or society".&lt;ref&gt;Olgiati 2007; also see Olgiati 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also defined "as a situation in which two or more legal systems coexist in the same social field".&lt;ref&gt;Sally Engle Merry 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Legal pluralists define law broadly to include not only the system of courts and judges backed by the coercive power of the state, but also the "non-legal forms of normative ordering".&lt;ref&gt;Merry 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Legal pluralism consists of many different methodological approaches and as a concept, it embraces "diverse and often contested perspectives on law, ranging from the recognition of different legal orders within the nation-state, to a more far reaching and open-ended concept of law that does not necessarily depend on state recognition for validity. This latter concept of law may come into being whenever two or more legal systems exist in the same social field".&lt;ref&gt;Ann Griffiths 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The ideology of legal positivism has had such a powerful hold on the imagination of lawyers and social scientists that its picture of the legal world has been able successfully to masquerade as fact and has formed the foundation stone of social and legal theory.|John Griffiths, "What is Legal Pluralism"&lt;ref&gt;John Griffiths, 1986:5.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Legal pluralism has occupied a central position in socio-legal theorising from the very beginning of the sociology of law. The sociological theories of [[Eugen Ehrlich]] and [[Georges Gurvitch]] were early sociological contributions to legal pluralism. It has, moreover, provided the most enduring topic of socio-legal debate over many decades within both the sociology of law and legal anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and has received more than its share of criticism from the proponents of the various schools of [[legal positivism]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example Tamanaha 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The critics often ask: "How is law distinguished in a pluralist view from other normative systems? What makes a social rule system legal?".&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2006: 37&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy arises mainly "from the claim that the only true law is the law made and enforced by the modern state".&lt;ref&gt;Woodman 2008: 25.&lt;/ref&gt; This standpoint is also known as "legal centralism". From a legal centralist standpoint, John Griffiths writes, "law is and should be the law of the state, uniform for all persons, exclusive of all other law, and administrated by a single set of state institutions.&lt;ref&gt;John Griffiths 1986: 3)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, according to legal centralism, "customary laws and religious laws are not properly called 'law' except in so far as state has chosen to adopt and treat any such normative order as part of its own law".&lt;ref&gt;Woodman 2008: 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinction is often made between the "weak" and the "strong" versions of legal pluralism. The "weak" version does not necessarily question the main assumptions of "legal centralism", but only recognises that within the domain of the Western state law other legal systems, such as customary or Islamic law, may also have an autonomous (co-)existence.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Griffiths, 2002: 291.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the "weak" version does not consider other forms of normative ordering as law. As Tamanaha, one of the critics of legal pluralism, puts it: "Normative ordering is, well, normative ordering. Law is something else, something that we isolate out and call law…".&lt;ref&gt;Tamanaha 1993: 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The "strong" version, on the other hand, rejects all legal centralist and formalist models of law, as "a myth, an ideal, a claim, an illusion,"&lt;ref&gt;John Griffiths 1986: 4.&lt;/ref&gt; regarding state law as one among many forms of law or forms of social ordering. It insists that modern law is plural, that it is private as well as public, but most importantly "the national (public official) legal system is often a secondary rather than the primary locus of regulation".&lt;ref&gt;Galanter 1981: 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The criticism directed at legal pluralism often uses the basic assumptions of legal positivism to question the validity of theories of legal pluralism which aim at criticising those very (positivistic) assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;See Banakar 2008&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Roger Cotterrell]] explains, the pluralist conception should be understood as part of "the legal sociologist's effort to broaden perspectives on law. A legal sociologist's specification of law might be different from that presupposed by a lawyer in practice, but it will relate (indeed, in some way incorporate) the latter because it must (if it is to reflect legal experience) take account of lawyers' perspectives on law. Thus a pluralist approach in legal theory is likely to recognise what lawyers typically recognize as law, but may see this law as one species of a larger genus, or treat lawyers' conception of law as reflecting particular perspectives determined by particular objectives".&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2006: 37&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autopoiesis===
[[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela]] originally coined the concept of autopoiesis within theoretical biology to describe the self-reproduction of living cells through self-reference.&lt;ref&gt;Maturana and Varela 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was later borrowed, reconstructed in sociological terms, and introduced into the sociology of law by [[Niklas Luhmann]].&lt;ref&gt;See Ziegert 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Luhmann's systems theory transcends the classical understanding of object/subject by regarding communication (and not 'action') as the basic element of any social system. He breaks with traditional systems theory of Talcott Parsons and descriptions based on cybernetic feedback loops and structural understandings of self-organisation of the 1960s. This allows him to work towards devising a solution to the problem of the humanised 'subject'.&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Perhaps the most challenging idea incorporated in the theory of autopoiesis is that social systems should not be defined in terms of human agency or norms, but of communications. Communication is in turn the unity of utterance, information and understanding and constitutes social systems by recursively reproducing communication. This sociologically radical thesis, which raises the fear of a dehumanised theory of law and society, attempts to highlight the fact that social systems are constituted by communicative."&lt;ref&gt;Banakar and Max Travers 2005: 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Roger Cotterrell]], "Luhmann... treats the theory as the basis for all general sociological analysis of social systems and their mutual relations.&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; But its theoretical claims about law's autonomy are very powerful postulates, presented in advance of (and even, perhaps, in place of) the kind of detailed empirical study of social and legal change that comparatists and most legal sociologists are likely to favour. The postulates of autopoiesis theory do not so much guide empirical research as explain conclusively how to interpret whatever this research may discover."&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2006: 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal cultures===
[[Legal culture]] is one of the central concepts of the sociology of law. The study of legal cultures may, at the same time, be regarded as one of the general approaches within the sociology of law.

As a concept, it refers to "relatively stable patterns of legally-oriented social behaviour and attitudes," and as such is regarded as a subcategory of the concept of culture.&lt;ref&gt;Nelken, 2004: 1.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a relatively new concept which, according to [[David Nelken]], can be traced to "terms like legal tradition or legal style, which have a much longer history in comparative law or in early political science. It presupposes and invites us to explore the existence of systematic variations in patterns in 'law in the books' and 'law in action,' and, above all, in the relation between them".&lt;ref&gt;Nelken 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an approach, it focuses on the cultural aspects of law, legal behaviour and legal institutions and, thus, has affinity with [[cultural anthropology]], legal pluralism, and [[comparative law]].

[[Lawrence M. Friedman]] is among socio-legal scholars who introduced the idea of legal culture into the sociology of law. For Friedman, legal culture "refers to public knowledge of and attitudes and behaviour patterns toward the legal system".&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, 1975, p. 193. But for criticism of the vagueness of this and other formulations of the concept of legal culture in sociology of law, see Cotterrell, 2006, ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt; It can also consist of "bodies of custom organically related to the culture as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, 1975, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; Friedman stresses the plurality of legal cultures and points out that one can explore legal cultures at different levels of abstraction, e.g. at the level of the legal system, the state, the country, or the community. Friedman is also known for introducing the distinction between the "internal" and "external" legal cultures. Somewhat oversimplified, the former refers to the general attitudes and perceptions of law among the functionaries of the legal system, such as the judiciary, while the latter can refer to the attitude of the citizenry to the legal system or to law and order generally.

===Feminism===
Law has always been regarded as one of the important sites of engagement for feminism. As pointed out by Ruth Fletcher feminist engagement with the law has taken many forms through the years, which also indicates their successful merging of theory and practice: "Through litigation, campaigns for reform and legal education, feminists have engaged explicitly with law and the legal profession. In taking on the provisions of specialist advice services, women's groups have played a role in making law accessible to those in need. By subjecting legal concepts and methods to critical analysis, feminists have questioned the terms of legal debate."&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Globalization===
[[Globalization]] is often defined in terms of economic processes which bring about radical cultural developments at the level of world society. Although law is an essential ingredient of the process of globalization - and important studies of law and globalization were already conducted in the 1990s by, for example, Yves Dezalay and Bryant Garth&lt;ref&gt;Dezalay and Garth 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and Volkmar Gessner&lt;ref&gt;Gessner and Budak 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; - law's importance for creating and maintaining the globalization processes are often neglected within the sociology of globalization and remain, arguably, somewhat underdeveloped within the sociology of law.&lt;ref&gt;For one of the relatively early empirical studies see Dezalay and Garth 1996. For a collection of empirical studies of law and globalization see Gessner and Budak 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

As pointed out by Halliday and Osinsky, "[[Economic globalization]] cannot be understood apart from global business regulation and the legal construction of the markets on which it increasingly depends. Cultural globalization cannot be explained without attention to intellectual property rights institutionalized in law and global governance regimes. The globalization of protections for vulnerable populations cannot be comprehended without tracing the impact of international criminal and humanitarian law or international tribunals. Global contestation over the institutions of democracy and state building cannot be meaningful unless considered in relation to constitutionalism."&lt;ref&gt;Halliday and Osinsk 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The socio-legal approaches to the study of globalization and global society often overlap with, or make use of, studies of legal cultures and legal pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;See Teubner 1996; Feest and Nelken 2007, Friedman and Perez-Perdomo 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Computer programs, software and patent law}}
The '''software patent debate''' is the argument about the extent to which, as a matter of [[public policy]], it should be possible to [[software patent|patent software]] and computer-implemented inventions. Policy debate on software patents has been active for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Nichols |first=Kenneth |title=Inventing Software: The Rise of "computer-related" Patents |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1998 |page=15 |isbn=1-56720-140-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opponents to software patents have gained more visibility with fewer resources through the years than their pro-patent opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Välimäki |first=Mikko |title=The Rise of Open Source Licensing |publisher=Turre Publishing |year=2005 |isbn=952-91-8779-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments and critiques have been focused mostly on the economic consequences of software patents.

One aspect of the debate has focused on the proposed [[European Union]] [[Proposed directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions|directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions]], also known as the "CII Directive" or the "Software Patent Directive," which was ultimately rejected by the [[European Parliament|EU Parliament]] in July 2005.

== Arguments for patentability ==
There are several arguments commonly given in defense of software patents or defense of the [[patentability]] of computer-implemented inventions.

===Public disclosure===
* Through public disclosure, patents encourage the open sharing of information and additional transparency about [[Legal liability|legal exposure]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gallini|first=Nancy T|date=2002-06-01|title=The Economics of Patents: Lessons from Recent U.S. Patent Reform|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0895330027292|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|language=en|volume=16|issue=2|pages=131–154|doi=10.1257/0895330027292|issn=0895-3309}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Through public disclosure, patents encourage the transfer of [[Mechanical system|mechanical technology]], which may apply more broadly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Economic benefit===
*Software patents resulting from the production of patentable ideas can increase the valuation of small companies.&lt;ref name=wipo&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wipo.int/sme/en/e_commerce/pat_help.htm |title=Ways in Which Patents can Help Your E-Commerce Business |publisher=World International Property Organization |accessdate=2008-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Software patents increase the return on investment made, which includes government funded research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coriat|first=Benjamin|title=Establishing a New Intellectual Property Rights Regime in the United States: Origins, Content and Problems|journal=Research Policy|year=2002|volume=31|issue=8–9|pages=1491–1507|doi=10.1016/s0048-7333(02)00078-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Encouragement of innovation===
*The ability to patent new software developed as a result of research encourages investment in software-related research by increasing the potential return of investment of said research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323582904578487200821421958|title=The Experts: Does the Patent System Encourage Innovation?|date=2013-05-16|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-03-29|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copyright limitations===
{{Main|Copyright infringement of software}}
Patents protect functionality. Copyright on the other hand only protects expression. Substantial modification to an original work, even if it performs the same function, would not be prevented by copyright. To prove copyright infringement also requires the additional hurdle of proving copying which is not necessary for patent infringement.

Copyright law protects unique expressions, while patent law protects inventions, which in the case of software, are [[algorithm]]s; copyright cannot protect a novel means of accomplishing a function, merely the syntax of one such means.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.law360.com/articles/5115/experts-debate-constitutionality-of-software-copyrights | title=Experts Debate Constitutionality Of Software Copyrights | access-date = 2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This means that patents incentivize projects that are unique and innovative in functionality rather than simply form.  Copyrights, in turn, only incentivize uniqueness in form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://partnershipforamericaninnovation.org/software-myths-and-facts/#copyrightenough | title=Software Myths and Facts | access-date = 2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protection for small companies ===
Software patents can afford smaller companies market protection by preventing larger companies from stealing work done by a smaller organization, leveraging their greater resources to go to market before the smaller company can.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/why-we-need-software-patents-and-yes-im-smarter-than-you/|title=Why we need software patents, and yes, I'm smarter than you {{!}} ZDNet|last=Shaw|first=Steven|work=ZDNet|access-date=2017-03-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hardware patents analogy===
Hardware and software are sometimes interchangeable. If people can patent hardware, then ideas describing software implemented by that hardware should also be patentable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323335404578444683887043510|title=Should Patents Be Awarded to Software? | access-date = 2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arguments against patentability ==
Opponents of software patents argue that:

=== Software is math ===
A program is the transcription of an [[algorithm]] in a [[programming language]]. Since every ([[Turing-complete]]) programming language implements Church's [[lambda calculus]] by virtue of the [[Church-Turing thesis]], a program is thus the transcription of a mathematical function. Math is not patentable. Therefore, neither is software.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Jones, [http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20091111151305785 An Explanation of Computation Theory for Lawyers].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Software encourages patent thickets===
A [[patent thicket]] is a dense web of patents that companies must decipher to develop new technology. There are various types of patent thickets such as when a single innovation is protected by multiple patent holders or when a product is covered by numerous patents. The consequences of patent thickets are increased difficulty of innovation, complex cross-licensing relations between companies, and discouragement of newcomers from entering the software industry.&lt;ref&gt;González, A. G. (2006). The software patent debate. Journal of Intellectual Property Law &amp; Practice, 1(3), 196–206. doi:10.1093/jiplp/jpi046&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinders research and development===
* Some scientific studies and expert reviews have concluded that patent systems paradoxically hinder technological progress&lt;ref&gt;Jaffe, Adam B.; Lerner, Joshua. Innovation and its discontents: how our broken patent system is endangering innovation and progress. {{ISBN|978-0-691-11725-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and allows monopolies and powerful companies to exclude others from industrial science in a manner that is irreconcilable with [[anti-trust]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Patents, Potential Competition, and Technical Progress |author=Almarin Phillips |journal=The American Economic Review |volume=56 |issue=1/2 |date=March 1, 1966 |pages=301–310 |jstor=1821293}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gary Becker]], Nobel Prize–winning economist, argues, "Their exclusion from the patent system would discourage some software innovations, but the saving from litigation costs over disputed patent rights would more than compensate the economy for that cost."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Timothy B.|title=Here’s why economists hate software patents|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2013/07/31/heres-why-economists-hate-software-patents/|accessdate=31 August 2016|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinders innovation===
* The Electronic Frontier Foundation published the [[Defend Innovation]] whitepaper after doing two and a half years of research on software patents. They concluded that many overbroad software patents are being awarded, which is actually stifling innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-outlines-plan-fix-broken-patent-system |title=EFF Outlines Plan to Fix the Broken Patent System |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Interoperability]] is thought to promote innovation, and patent systems have the potential to block the development of such technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Samuelson|first=Pamela|year=2008|title=Are Patents on Interfaces Impeding Interoperability|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2712&amp;context=facpubs|journal=Berkeley Law|volume=|pages=|via=Berkeley Law Scholarship Repository}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There has been a lack of empirical evidence to suggest that patents have any positive effect on innovation, and furthermore, the system primarily “encourage[s] failing monopolists to inhibit competition by blocking innovation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boldrin|first=Michele|last2=Levine|first2=David K|date=2013-02-01|title=The Case Against Patents|url=http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jep.27.1.3|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|language=en|volume=27|issue=1|pages=3–22|doi=10.1257/jep.27.1.3|issn=0895-3309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost and loss of R&amp;D funds===
*Should a software developer hire a [[patent attorney]] to perform a [[clearance search and opinion|clearance search]] and provide a [[clearance search and opinion|clearance opinion]], there is no guarantee that the search could be complete. Different patents and published patent applications may use different words to describe the same concepts and thus patents that cover different aspects of the invention may not show up in a search. The cost of a clearance search may not prove to be cost effective to businesses with smaller budgets or individual inventors.&lt;ref&gt;Mulligan, Christina and Lee, Timothy B., Scaling the Patent System (March 6, 2012). NYU Annual Survey of American Law, Forthcoming. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2016968&lt;/ref&gt;
* For the U.S. the economic benefit is dubious. A study in 2008 found that American public companies’ total profits from patents (excluding pharmaceuticals) in 1999 were about $4 billion, but that the associated litigation costs were $14 billion.&lt;ref name=economist&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21526370 |title=Patent medicine - Why America’s patent system needs to be reformed, and how to do it|publisher=Economist |accessdate=2011-09-26|date=2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Software developers and hardware manufacturers may be forced to pay license fees for standards that are covered by patents (the so-called [[essential patents]]). Some examples are [[H.264]], [[MP3]] and [[Graphics Interchange Format#Unisys and LZW patent enforcement|GIF]] (that uses the patented [[LZW]] compression algorithm) and [[JPEG]] for graphics.

===Copyright===
*It is argued that traditional copyright has provided sufficient protection to facilitate massive investment in software development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nosoftwarepatents.com/en/m/basics/index.html |title=The Basics |publisher=NoSoftwarePatents.com |accessdate=2008-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Copyright]] is the right of an author(s) to prevent others from copying their creative work without a license. Thus the author of a particular piece of software can sue someone that copies that software without a license. Copyright protection is given automatically and immediately without the need to register the copyright with a government, although registration does strengthen protection. Copyrighted material can also be kept secret.

===Software is different===
{{see also|artificial scarcity}}
* Software programs are different from other electromechanical devices because they are designed solely in terms of their function. The inventor of a typical electromechanical device must design new physical features to qualify for a patent. On the other hand, a software developer need only design new functions to create a working embodiment of the program.&lt;ref name="rplotkin"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1109/ISTAS.2002.1013821 |chapter=Intellectual property and the process of invention: Why software is different |title=IEEE 2002 International Symposium on Technology and Society (ISTAS'02). Social Implications of Information and Communication Technology. Proceedings (Cat. No.02CH37293) |pages=236 |year=2002 |last1=Plotkin |first1=R. |isbn=0-7803-7284-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Software is a component of a machine. The computer’s hardware is generic; it performs functions that are common to all of the software that is capable of being executed on the computer. Each software program that is capable of executing on the computer is a component of the computer.&lt;ref name="rplotkin"/&gt;
* Computers "design" and build the structure of executable software. Thus, software developers do not ''design'' the executable software's physical structure because they merely provide the functional terms.&lt;ref name="rplotkin"/&gt;

===Trivial patents===
*Anecdotal evidence suggests that some software patents cover either trivial inventions or inventions that would have been obvious to persons of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made.&lt;ref&gt;James Bessen &amp; Michael J. Meurer "Patent Failure: How Judges, Bureaucrats, and Lawyers Put Innovators at Risk" Princeton University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-691-13491-8}}: "(...) many people have focused solely on patent examination quality as the objective of reform, based largely on anecdotal evidence of trivial, obvious, or otherwise invalid patents. Although we support efforts to improve patent examination quality (large numbers of questionable patents create conditions in which poor patent notice is unavoidable), our analysis suggests that this is only part of the problem and the patent system cannot likely be fixed by addressing only this issue. Of course, the notice problems that we find central to the poor performance of the patent system are not the only ones looking for a remedy. We argue, however, that many proposed reforms, including reforms directed toward improving patent examination quality, are unlikely to be effective unless patent notice is improved generally".&lt;/ref&gt;
*Patent examiners rarely have a comprehensive knowledge of the specific technologies disclosed in the patent applications they examine. This is in large part due to the enormous number of micro-niches in the software field and the relatively limited number of examiners. So, patents are sometimes allowed on inventions that appear to be trivial extensions of existing technologies.&lt;ref&gt;James Bessen &amp; Michael J. Meurer "Patent Failure: How Judges, Bureaucrats, and Lawyers Put Innovators at Risk" Princeton University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-691-13491-8}}: "It is possible, however, that features of software technology make it particularly susceptible to the patenting of obvious ideas, especially given the legal doctrines of non-obviousness developed by the Federal Circuit. For one thing, the general-purpose nature of software technology—again, because the technology is abstract, similar techniques can be used in a wide range of applications— makes it inevitable that techniques known in one realm might be applied in another, yet the documentary evidence that the Federal Circuit requires for a demonstration of obviousness might not be published."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open source disadvantage===
{{Main|Software patents and free software}}
* The free and open source software community, and many companies that use and contribute to open source oppose software patents because they can impede or prohibit the distribution of free software. They contend that patents threaten to undermine FLOSS, regardless of innovations produced by FLOSS collaborations.

===Software patents' usefulness as an information source is limited===
*Some patent disclosures in the software field are not readable to some programmers; as a result, patents are rarely used as a source of technical information by software developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.zdnet.com/news/software-patents-need-shelter-from-the-storm/131591 |title=Software patents need shelter from the storm |publisher=ZDNet - Tech News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long patent pendencies===
* In the software industry, [[product lifecycle]]s churn rapidly; a product can run through its entire lifecycle and become outdated during the time it takes a patent filed on the invention underlying it to issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=To Promote Innovation: The Proper Balance of Competition and Patent Law and Policy A Report by the Federal Trade Commission|date=October 2003|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|url=https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/promote-innovation-proper-balance-competition-and-patent-law-and-policy/innovationrpt.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Chapter 3, p 45}}
*According to the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]]’s official statistics for 2015, the average [[pendency for patent applications]] categorized under “Computer Architecture, Software, and Information Security”  was approximately two and a half years, exceeding the pendencies of all other patent categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/USPTOFY15PAR.pdf |title=USPTO Performance and Accountability Report 2015 |publisher=United States Patent Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology patents in China, Korea, Japan, and Europe had first action pendencies of approximately one year compared to those in the United States, with first action pendencies of under two years. Europe and the United States have the longest total pendencies of around 26 months, while China, Korea, and Japan have shorter total pendencies from 15 to 21 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fiveipoffices.org/statistics/statisticsreports/2015edition/IP5SR2015full.pdf |title=IP5 Statistics Report 2015 |publisher=IP5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patent trolls===
*Software companies are becoming patent hoarders, spending billions of dollars on accumulating patents and even more on litigations and settlements – resources could be better put to use in creating new and innovative software advances. Too many patents are given out, making it difficult for developers to create new software due to possibility of accidental infringement. Engineers say it impedes their creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=:https://www.wired.com/2015/02/eff-eliminate-software-patents/| title= EFF: If You Want to Fix Software Patents, Eliminate Software Patents| access-date= 2017-04-26}} &lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2016 IBM earned 8,088 U.S. patents; thus earning the most grants from the U.S. Patent Office for the 24th year in a row. They bested their closest tech rival by more than 2,500 patents. Behemoths like IBM, Google, and Oracle gather as many patents in the fields considered 'hot' such as Artificial Intelligence to limit the innovation potential of smaller firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=:https://www.uspto.gov/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patent claims were part of the ''[[Oracle America, Inc. v. Google, Inc.]]'' case, where Oracle claimed that Google's implementation of Java within Android violated Oracle's copyright and patents. [[Duke University|Duke]] Computer Science Professor [[Owen Astrachan]] was involved in the case. 
*Not only large companies are patent hoarders. NPEs (Non-Practising Entities) are businesses that assert patents through litigation to achieve revenues from alleged infringers without practising or commercialising the technology covered by the patents they hold. NPEs are very effective in their litigations. Damages awards for NPEs almost are 3 times greater than practicing entities over the last 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=:https://www.pwc.com/us/en/forensic-services/publications/assets/2016-pwc-patent-litigation-study.pdf/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disproportionately harms startups===
* Patent assertion entities ([[patent trolls]]) disproportionately affect startups, which are important for job creation and innovation. Companies with less than $100M annual revenue represent two-thirds of unique defendants in troll suits. A large percentage of startups reported that being sued by trolls resulted in significant operational impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://journals.law.stanford.edu/stanford-technology-law-review/online/startups-and-patent-trolls |title=Startups and Patent Trolls |publisher=Stanford Technology Law Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== U.S. Supreme Court decisions ==
Several [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] decisions since 2000, as well as the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit|Federal Circuit]] and district court decisions interpreting and implementing them, have dramatically impacted the status of software patents in the United States. They have particularly affected many thousands of business-method patents that issued as a result of Federal Circuit decisions in the 1990s. The two principal Supreme Court decisions were ''[[Bilski v. Kappos]]'' and ''[[Alice v. CLS Bank]]'', the latter of which confirmed the applicability of the earlier decision ''[[Mayo v. Prometheus]]'' to computer-related inventions in which a computer was used to implement an abstract principle or preexisting business practice. (These cases are the subject of separate Wikipedia articles, which discuss the background and rulings in these cases in more detail, and supply authorities supporting the generalizations about those cases that follow. Additional detail is found in the Wikipedia article ''[[Software patents under United States patent law]]'', along with supporting citations not repeated in this summary of those articles.)

=== ''Bilski'' case ===
The ''Bilski'' case involved a patent application on methods for hedging against commodity price fluctuations, which the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|PTO]] had rejected. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit|Federal Circuit]], in ''[[In re Bilski]]'', upheld the PTO's rejection on the grounds that the claims failed the [[machine-or-transformation test]], which the court held should be used as the sole test of patent eligibility. The court did not hold all business methods to be patent ineligible, although a minority of the judges would have ruled that business methods are not properly the subject of patents.

The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of ineligibility, in ''[[Bilski v. Kappos]]'', but on more general, and less articulated in detail, grounds of undue abstractness. It rejected the Federal Circuit's elevation of the machine-or-transformation test as the sole test of patent eligibility, saying that rather it was simply a "useful clue." The 5-4 majority refused to hold that all business methods were incapable of being patented, but four justices would have established such a rule. A concurring opinion pointed out that the Court was unanimous, however, as to many issues in the ''Bilski'' case, including a rejection of the Federal Circuit's late 1990s [[State Street Bank v. Signature Financial Group|''State Street Bank'']] decision, which allowed patents on any advance, technical or nontechnical (and in that case a numerical financial calculation of stock price changes) that produces a "useful, concrete and tangible result."

The Supreme Court's ''Bilski'' decision was criticized because of its lack of detailed guidance on how to determine whether a claim was directed to an abstract idea. Nonetheless, it provided some clarification and affirmed the Federal Circuit's taking a new direction in its software-related patent cases.

=== ''Mayo'' case ===
In ''[[Mayo v. Prometheus]]'', the Supreme Court invalidated a patent on a diagnostic method, because it non-inventively implemented a natural principle; the Court drew on cases involving computer software and other abstract ideas. In this case, the Court was much more detailed in describing how to recognize a patent-ineligible claim to an abstract idea. The ''Mayo'' methodology has come to dominate patent-eligibility law.  It revived the approach of the [[Parker v. Flook|''Flook'']] and [[Neilson v. Harford|''Neilson'']] cases, which is to treat the underlying principle, idea, or algorithm on which the claimed patent is based as if it were part of the prior art and to make patent eligibility turn on whether the implementation of it is inventive. This led to the "two-step" ''Alice'' test described next.

=== ''Alice'' case ===
At the time the ''Mayo'' case was decided, there was some uncertainty over whether it applied only to natural principles (laws of nature) or more generally to patent eligibility of all abstract ideas and general principles, including those involved in software patents. The ''Alice'' decision confirmed that the test was general. The ''Alice'' case involved patents on electronic methods and computer programs for financial-trading systems on which trades between two parties who are to exchange payment are settled by a third party in ways that reduce the risk that one party will perform while the other will not. The patents cover what amounts to a computerized escrow arrangement.

The Court held that ''Mayo'' explained how to address the problem of determining whether a patent claimed an unpatentable abstract idea or instead a potentially patentable practical implementation of an idea. This requires using a "two-step" analysis.

In the first step, the court must determine whether the patent claim under examination contains an abstract idea, such as an algorithm, method of computation, or other general principle. If not, the claim is potentially patentable, subject to the other requirements of the patent code. If the answer is affirmative, the court must proceed to the next step.

In the second step of the analysis, the court must determine whether the patent adds to the idea "something extra" that embodies an "inventive concept." If there is no addition of an inventive element to the underlying abstract idea, the court will find the patent invalid under section 101. This means that the implementation of the idea must not be conventional or obvious to qualify for a patent. Ordinary and customary use of a general-purpose digital computer is insufficient; the Court said—"merely requiring generic computer implementation fails to transform [an] abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention."

The ruling continued with these points:

* A mere instruction to implement an abstract idea on a computer "cannot impart patent eligibility."
* "[T]he mere recitation of a generic computer cannot transform a patent-ineligible abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention." 
* "Stating an abstract idea 'while adding the words "apply it"' is not enough for patent eligibility."
* "Nor is limiting the use of an abstract idea to a particular technological environment."

The ''Alice'' decision met a mixed reception, but it has profoundly affected U.S. patent law. In its wake, as explained in the [[Alice v. CLS Bank|Wikipedia article on the case]], vast numbers of so-called software and business-method patents have been invalidated (the overwhelming majority of those which the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]] has considered and the number of such patents issuing has drastically fallen. The ''Alice'' decision has been widely criticized for its failure to specify in detail the boundaries of patent eligibility, but it has also been defended because its unanimity tends to stabilize decisional law in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Stern, [http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/Alice-EIPR.pdf ''Alice v CLS Bank: US Business Method and Software Patents Marching towards Oblivion?''], [2014] {{smallcaps|Eur. Intell. Prop. Rev.}} 619, 629.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subsequent developments ===
After ''Alice'', the Federal Circuit and district courts invalidated large numbers of business-method and software patents based on those courts' interpretations of ''Alice''. Federal Circuit Judge [[William Curtis Bryson|William Bryson]] summed this up in these terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In short, such patents, although frequently dressed up in the argot of invention, simply describe a problem, announce purely functional steps that purport to solve the problem, and recite standard computer operations to perform some of those steps. The principal flaw in these patents is that they do not contain an “inventive concept” that solves practical problems and ensures that the patent is directed to something “significantly more than” the ineligible abstract idea itself. [Citing ''Alice'' and ''Mayo''.] As such, they represent little more than functional descriptions of objectives, rather than inventive solutions. In addition, because they describe the claimed methods in functional terms, they preempt any subsequent specific solutions to the problem at issue. [Citing ''Alice'' and ''Mayo''.] It is for those reasons that the Supreme Court has characterized such patents as claiming “abstract ideas” and has held that they are not directed to patentable subject matter.

A '''voting age''' is a [[age of majority|minimum age]] established by law that a person must attain before they become eligible to [[suffrage|vote in a public election]]. Today, the most common voting age is 18 years; however, voting ages as low as 16 and as high as 25 currently exist (see list below). Most  countries have set a minimum voting age, often set in their constitution. In a number of countries [[compulsory voting|voting is compulsory]] for those eligible to vote, while in most it is optional.

When the [[suffrage|right to vote]] was being established in [[democracy|democracies]], the voting age was generally set at 21 or higher. In the 1970s many countries reduced the voting age to 18. The debate is ongoing in a number of countries on proposals to reduce the voting age to or below 18.

Before [[World War II|the Second World War]] of 1939–1945, the voting age in almost all countries was 21 years or higher. In 1946 Czechoslovakia became the first state to reduce the voting age to 20 years, and by 1968 a total of 17 countries had lowered their voting age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aomol.net/000001/000138/html/am138--51.html ''"Lowering the Minimum Voting Age to 18  Years - Pro and Con Arguments"''], Constitutional Revision Study Documents of the [[Maryland]] Constitutional Convention Commission, 1968.

By the end of the 20th century, 18 had become by far the most common voting age. However, a few countries maintain a voting age of 20 years or higher. It was argued{{by whom?|date=November 2018}} that young men could be drafted to go to war at 18, and many{{quantify|date=November 2018}} people felt they should be able to vote at the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Sanders|first= Mark|title= Your Right To Vote|date= 2000|publisher= Raintree Steck- Vaugh company|location= United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=November 2018}}

==Debate on lowering the voting age to 16==
[[File: NYRA Berkeley voting age protest.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Demonstration in favour of lowering the voting age by members of [[National Youth Rights Association|NYRA]] [[Berkeley, California]] (2004)]]
Around the year 2000, a number of countries began to consider whether the voting age ought to be reduced further, with arguments most often being made in favour of a reduction to 16. The earliest moves came during the 1990s, when the voting age for [[municipal elections]] in some [[States of Germany]] was lowered to 16. [[Lower Saxony]] was the first state to make such a reduction, in 1995, and four other states did likewise.&lt;ref name="16 locals"/&gt;

Arguments against lowering the voting age to sixteen include lack of political maturity. On the other hand, one of the major arguments for lowering the voting age to 16 is that at this age in most countries a person has reached the [[legal working age]] for most jobs and is liable to pay taxes and therefore [[No taxation without representation|should not have to pay taxes without the right to political representation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youngcitizens.org/lowering-the-voting-age-to-16 Lowering the voting age to 16]. ''Young Citizens''. Retrieved 21 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2000s several proposals for a reduced voting age were put forward in [[U.S. states]], including [[California]], [[Florida]] and [[Alaska]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://youthrights.org/votestatus.php Worldwide Efforts to Lower the Voting Age], National Youth Rights Association&lt;/ref&gt; but none was successful. A national reduction was proposed in 2005 in [[Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Parliament of Canada]], Bill C-261 (2005); [http://vote16.ca/en/index.htm Vote16, Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070801045625/http://vote16.ca/en/index.htm |date=1 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Australia]]n state of [[New South Wales]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Parliament of New South Wales]], Parliamentary Electorates and Elections Amendment (Voting Age) Bill (2005); [[Hansard]], 14 September 2005, [http://parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/PARLMENT/hansArt.nsf/V3Key/LC20050914041 p. 17686] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929125157/http://parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/PARLMENT/hansArt.nsf/V3Key/LC20050914041 |date=29 September 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; but these proposals were not adopted. In May 2009, Danish Member of Parliament [[Mogens Jensen]] presented an initiative to the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Parliamentary Assembly]] of the [[Council of Europe]] in [[Strasbourg]] to lower the voting age in Europe to 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc09/EDOC11895.pdf|title=edoc11895|format=PDF|accessdate=6 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527175929/http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc09/EDOC11895.pdf|archivedate=27 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
A report suggesting that consideration be given to reducing the voting age to 16 in the [[Australian Capital Territory]] in [[Canberra]], Australia was tabled in the [[Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly|territorial legislature]] on 26 September 2007 and defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ACT to consider lowering voting age|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)]]|date=26 September 2007|url=http://abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/26/2043628.htm|accessdate=29 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, federal Opposition Leader [[Bill Shorten]] said that the voting age should be lowered to 16.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;ABC News, 31 October 2015, [http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-31/shorten-calls-for-voting-age-to-be-lowered-to-16/6901464 Bill Shorten calls for voting age to be lowered to 16]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Austria===
In 2007, Austria became the first member of the [[European Union]] to adopt a voting age of 16 for most purposes.&lt;ref name="Austria 4"/&gt; The voting age had been reduced in Austria from 19 to 18 at all levels in 1992.

On 20 November 2013, Malta lowered the voting age from 18 to 16 for local elections starting from 2015. The proposal had wide support from both the government and opposition, social scientists and youth organizations.

On Monday 29 January 2018, the Maltese Parliament debated to lower the voting age to 16 for general elections, European Parliament Elections and referenda.

On Monday, 5 March 2018, the Maltese Parliament unanimously voted in favour of amending the constitution, lowering the official voting age from 18 to 16, making Malta the second state in the [[European Union|EU]] to lower its voting age to 16.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/85054/vote_16_unanimously_approved&lt;/ref&gt;

Men in military service who turned 19 during the first world war were entitled to vote in 1918 irrespective of their age as part of the ''[[Representation of the People Act 1918]]'' which also allowed some women over the age of 30 to vote.

{{main|Voting rights in the United States#Young people}}
In the United States, the debate about lowering voting age from 21 to 18 began during [[World War II]] and intensified during the [[Vietnam War]], when most of those subjected to the draft were too young to vote, and the image of young men being forced to risk their lives in the military without the privileges of voting successfully pressured legislators to lower the voting age nationally and in many states. By 1968, several states had lowered the voting age below 21 years: Alaska and Hawaii's minimum age was 20, Kentucky's was 19, and Georgia's was 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Constitution lowers voting age to 19|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BSwmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Ff4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=770%2C2580870|work=Baltimore Afro-American|date=6 April 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, the Supreme Court in ''[[Oregon v. Mitchell]]'' ruled that Congress had the right to regulate the minimum voting age in federal elections; however, not at local and state level.

The [[26th Amendment to the United States Constitution|26th Amendment]] (passed and ratified in 1971)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/the-26th-amendment |title=The 26th Amendment|publisher=A&amp;E Television Networks|year=1996|accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; prevents states from setting a voting age higher than 18.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CONAN-2014/pdf/GPO-CONAN-2014-10-27.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Except for the express limitations provided for in Amendments XIV, XV, XIX and XXVI, voter qualifications for House and Senate elections are largely delegated to the States under Article I, Section 2 and Amendment XVII of the United States Constitution, which respectively state that "The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States, and ''the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature''." and "The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, elected by the people thereof, for six years; and each Senator shall have one vote. The ''electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html|title=Transcript of the Constitution of the United States - Official Text|work=archives.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

21 states permit 17-year-olds to vote in [[primary elections]] and caucuses if they will be 18 by election day: Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nmlegis.gov/Sessions/16%20Regular/bills/house/HB0138.pdf|title=House Bill 138, 52ND LEGISLATURE - STATE OF NEW MEXICO - SECOND SESSION, 2016|last=Steinborn|first=Jeff|date=|website=New Mexico Legislature|publisher=New Mexico Legislature|access-date=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; North Dakota, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Virginia, Vermont, and Washington. Alaska, Kansas, North Dakota and Washington allow 17-year-olds to participate in Democrat caucuses, but not in the Republican caucus.

Currently, the Maine Green Independent Party, the state branch of the [[Green Party of the United States]], calls for the lowering of the voting age to 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mainegreens.org/index.php?sectionID=266&amp;pageID=590&amp;mode= |title=Green Platform|publisher=Mainegreens.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Youth suffrage]] appears to be gaining ground in [[Massachusetts]]; three of the four Democratic United States Senate candidates in 2010 supported lowering the voting age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lowerthevote.wordpress.com/2009/11/30/three-massachusetts-senator-candidates-support-lower-voting-age|title=Three Massachusetts Senator Candidates Support Lower Voting Age|publisher=Lowerthevote.wordpress.com|date=30 November 2009|accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the [[Takoma Park, Maryland|City of Takoma Park, Maryland]] became the first place in the United States to lower its voting age to 16, for local (but not general) elections and referendums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/takoma-park-grants-16-year-olds-right-to-vote/2013/05/14/b27c52c4-bccd-11e2-89c9-3be8095fe767_story.html|title=Takoma Park grants 16-year-olds right to vote|publisher=WashingtonPost.com|date=14 May 2013|first=Lindsay A.|last=Powers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/11/05/election-day-weird/3448145/|publisher=USA Today|title=16-year-olds voting?

===Venezuela===
A request to lower the voting age to 16 was made during consideration of revisions to the [[Constitution of Venezuela]] in 2007. [[Cilia Flores]], president of the [[National Assembly of Venezuela|National Assembly]], announced that the Mixed Committee for Constitutional Reform had found the idea acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jeremy|last=Morgan|title=Further details of Chavez' package of constitutional reforms are emerging|publisher=Caracas Daily Journal|date=9 September 2007|url=http://www.vheadline.com/readnews.asp?id=75781|accessdate=29 July 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303233819/http://www.vheadline.com/readnews.asp?id=75781|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following approval in the legislature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Matthew|last=Walter|title=Venezuela May Lower Voting Age, Add Gay Rights in Constitution|publisher=Bloomberg.com|date=11 October 2007|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601086&amp;sid=aqg5jOxmM.Vg&amp;refer=latin_america|accessdate=13 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the amendment formed part of the package of constitutional proposals, and was defeated in the [[Venezuelan constitutional referendum, 2007|2007 referendum]].

==Maximum voting age==
There are occasional calls for a maximum voting age, on the grounds that older people have less of a stake in the future of the country or jurisdiction and tend to vote on the basis of self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gareth Morgan (economist)|Gareth Morgan]],[https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11467418 Introduce a maximum voting age], [[New Zealand Herald]], 19 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voting ages around the world==
Eighteen is the most common voting age, with a small minority of countries differing from this rule. Those with a national minimum age of 17 include East Timor, Greece, Indonesia, North Korea, [[South Sudan]] and Sudan. The minimum age is 16 in Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua and the [[Isle of Man]], Jersey and Guernsey (three self-governing British Crown Dependencies). People aged 16–18 can vote in Bosnia, Serbia and Montenegro if employed. The highest minimum voting age is 21 in several nations. Some countries have variable provision for the minimum voting age, whereby a lower age is set for eligibility to vote in state, regional or municipal elections.

The only known maximum voting age is in the [[Holy See]], where the franchise for electing a new Pope is restricted to [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinals]] under the age of 80.

A '''Writ of Kalikasan''' is a [[legal remedy]] under [[Philippines|Philippine]] law that provides protection of one's Constitutional right to a healthy environment, as outlined in Section 16, Article II of the [[Philippine Constitution]], which says the "state shall protect and advance the right of the people to a balanced and healthful ecology in accord with the rhythm and harmony of nature."&lt;ref name=Inquirer2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Inquirer Research|title=In the Know: Writ of kalikasan–Proudly Filipino|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/111233/in-the-know-writ-of-kalikasan-proudly-filipino|accessdate=17 September 2014|issue=Wednesday, September 17|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Kalikasan" is a Filipino word for "nature".&lt;ref name=Inquirer2014 /&gt;

The writ is comparable to the [[writ of amparo]] and the [[writ of habeas corpus]].&lt;ref name=Inquirer2014 /&gt;  In contrast, this writ protects one's right for a healthy environment rather than constitutional rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.shepheard-walwyn.co.uk/product/eradicating-ecocide/ | title=Eradicating ecocide: laws and governance to prevent the destruction of our planet | publisher=Shepheard-Walwyn | last=Higgins | first=Polly | year=2010 | location=London | isbn=978-0-85683-275-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writ of kalikasan is "proudly Philippine-made", unlike the other two writs that have roots in European and Latin American law.&lt;ref name=Inquirer2014 /&gt;

==History==
Provision for the Writ of Kalikasan was written in 2010 by the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] under Rule 7 of the Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases as a Special Civil Action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chanrobles.com/scdecisions/rulesofcourt/2010/am_09-6-8-sc_2010.php A.M. No. 09-6-8-SC: April 13, 2010], Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases, Supreme Court of the Philippines.&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court under [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Chief Justice]] [[Reynato Puno]] took the initiative and issued Rules of Procedure for Environmental Case because Section 16, Article II of the Philippines' 1986 Constitution was not a self-executing provision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://notocoal.weebly.com/writ-of-kalikasan.html#.T4tr17P9P0c What is a Writ of Kalikasan?], [http://notocoal.weebly.com/ notocoal.weebly.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cases==
The writ of Kalikasan may be sought to deal with environmental damage of such magnitude that it threatens life, health, or property of inhabitants in two or more cities or provinces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icj.org/dwn/img_prd/Philippines-ElecDist.pdf Access to Justice : Human Rights Abuses Involving Corporations], International Commission of Jurists, p. 17, {{ISBN|978-92-9037-148-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, the Philippine Supreme Court ruled unanimously against issuing a writ of kalikasan against the [[United States Government]] over the [[USS Guardian (MCM-5)#January 2013 grounding|grounding of the USS Guardian]] on the [[Tubbataha Reef]] in 2013.&lt;ref name=Inquirer2014 /&gt;
