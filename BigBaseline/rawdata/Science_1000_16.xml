Described in a leading development journal as [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1467-7660 'one of the most lauded contributions to recent mainstream development thinking'], ''Aid on the Edge of Chaos'' has been endorsed by many top scientists and international leaders, including four Nobel Laureates in Medicine, Economics and Chemistry and the heads of [[Red Cross]] and [[United Nations]] as well as many NGO leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aidontheedge.info/quotes/ |title=Reviews &amp;#124; Aid on the Edge of Chaos |publisher=Aidontheedge.info |date= |accessdate=2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been positively reviewed by various press outlets, including ''[[The Economist]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author =Economist |url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21601226-poor-and-benighted |title=The politics of foreign aid: Poor and benighted |publisher=The Economist |date=2014-04-26 |accessdate=2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Financial Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author =Amy Kazmin |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/5e4ebccc-7312-11e3-b05b-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2yL7uAoC0 |title=Aid on the Edge of Chaos, by Ben Ramalingam |publisher=FT.com |date=2014-01-05 |accessdate=2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Heiner Janus |author2=Sebastian Paulo |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/dec/24/book-review-aid-edge-of-chaos |title=Aid on the edge of chaos - review &amp;#124; Global Development Professionals Network &amp;#124; Guardian Professional |publisher=Theguardian.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[New Scientist]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22029471.100-look-to-complexity-theory-to-solve-the-aid-problem.html#.UrGnLxbEOlk |title=Look to complexity theory to solve the aid problem - health - 16 December 2013 |publisher=New Scientist |date=2013-12-16 |accessdate=2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v503/n7475/full/503195a.html&lt;/ref&gt; Lancet, Harvard Business Review and the British Medical Journal.

It was also the focus of an interview feature with the author in ''[[Huffington Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dennis-whittle/ben-ramalingam-on-aid-and_b_805838.html |title=Dennis Whittle: Ben Ramalingam on Aid and Complexity |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2011-01-07 |accessdate=2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Aid on the Edge of Chaos'' was the subject of a public lecture by Ben Ramalingam at the [[Royal Society of Arts]], London, in December 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thersa.org/events/our-events/whats-next-for-foreign-aid |title=What's Next For Foreign Aid? |publisher=RSA |date=2013-12-05 |accessdate=2014-05-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203133836/http://www.thersa.org/events/our-events/whats-next-for-foreign-aid |archivedate=2013-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an event chaired by [[Geoff Mulgan]], CEO of [[NESTA]]. The book was discussed by Ramalingam and Sir John Holmes at the [[Oxford Literary Festival]] in March 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxfordliteraryfestival.org/literature-events/2014/Thursday-27/aid-on-the-edge-of-chaos-how-do-we-make-it-count |title=Ben Ramalingam and John Holmes Interviewed by Bidisha - Aid on the Edge of Chaos: How Do We Make it Count - 27 Mar 2014 |publisher=Oxford Literary Festival |date=2014-03-27 |accessdate=2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; an event chaired by leading British filmmaker and author [[Bidisha]].

&lt;br /&gt;a) Misinterpreted [[Regression to the mean|natural course]] – the individual gets better without treatment.
&lt;br /&gt;b) [[Placebo|Placebo effect]] or false treatment effect – an individual receives "alternative therapy" and is convinced it will help. The conviction makes them more likely to get better.
&lt;br /&gt;c) [[Nocebo]] effect – an individual is convinced that standard treatment will not work, and that alternative treatment will work. This decreases the likelihood standard treatment will work, while the placebo effect of the "alternative" remains. 
&lt;br /&gt;d) No adverse effects — Standard treatment is replaced with "alternative" treatment, getting rid of adverse effects, but also of improvement.
&lt;br /&gt; e) Interference — Standard treatment is "complemented" with something that interferes with its effect. This can both cause worse effect, but also decreased (or even increased) side effects, which may be interpreted as "helping".
&lt;br /&gt;Researchers such as [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]], [[clinical statistician]]s and [[pharmacology|pharmacologist]]s use [[clinical trial]]s to tease out such effects, allowing doctors to offer only that which has been shown to work. "Alternative treatments" often refuse to use trials or make it deliberately hard to do so.

'''Alternative medicine''', '''fringe medicine''', '''pseudomedicine''' or simply '''questionable medicine''' is the use and promotion of practices which are unproven, disproven, impossible to prove, or excessively harmful in relation to their effect — in the attempt to achieve the [[healing]] effects of [[medicine]].&lt;!--{{refn|name=Harrisonquote|group=n}}{{refn|name=NSFquote|group=n|}}{{refn|name=Angellquote|group=n}}--&gt;&lt;!--{{refn|group=n|According to the Tzu Chi Institute, a Canadian centre established to evaluate complementary and alternative therapies, "alternative therapies are those lacking scientific validation that are excluded from medical school training programs and uninsured by health plans."&lt;ref name=IGPIAMAYP/&gt;}}&lt;ref name=ATRAMM/&gt;&lt;ref name=NSF_2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=Angell1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=NP/&gt;--&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref name="ConsumerHealth9th" /&gt; --&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1019807158|title=More harm than good? : the moral maze of complementary and alternative medicine|last=(Edzard)|first=Ernst, E.|publisher=|others=Smith, Kevin|year=|isbn=9783319699417|location=Cham, Switzerland|pages=18|oclc=1019807158}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; They differ from [[experimental medicine]] in that the latter employs [[Clinical trial|responsible investigation]], and accepts results that show it to be ineffective.&lt;!--Consumer health, page 133 --&gt; The [[scientific consensus]] is that alternative therapies either do not, or cannot, work. In some cases [[Scientific law|laws of nature]] are violated by their basic claims; in some the treatment is so much worse that its use is [[medical ethics|unethical]].&lt;!--Clarification, for those that cannot work see homeopathy, which does not abide by the laws of physics--&gt; Alternative practices, products, and therapies range from only ineffective to having known harmful and [[Toxicity|toxic]] effects.&lt;!--{{refn|group=n|name=IOMquote}}&lt;ref name=ATRAMM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hines_Sampson_Coulter_Sagan/&gt;&lt;ref name="CAM_Sointu_Nissen_Eisenberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name=DaguptaHStabler2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=FDA_regulatory/&gt;--&gt;  &lt;!--Edzard Enrst meta-analysis--&gt;

Alternative therapies may be [[Regression fallacy|credited]] for perceived improvement through [[placebo|placebo effects]], decreased use or effect of medical treatment (and therefore either decreased [[side effects]]; or [[Nocebo|nocebo effects]] towards standard treatment),&lt;!--&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zeller |first=T. |last2=Muenstedt |first2=K. |last3=Stoll |first3=C. |last4=Schweder |first4=J. |last5=Senf|first5=B.|last6=Ruckhaeberle|first6=E.|last7=Becker|first7=S. |last8=Serve |first8=H. |last9=Huebner |first9=J. |date=2013-03-01 |title=Potential interactions of complementary and alternative medicine with cancer therapy in outpatients with gynecological cancer in a comprehensive cancer center|journal=Journal of Cancer Research and Clinical Oncology |volume=139 |issue=3 |pages=357–65 |doi=10.1007/s00432-012-1336-6 |issn=1432-1335|pmid=23099993}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; or the [[Regression toward the mean|natural course of the condition or disease]]. Alternative treatment is not the same as [[Medical research|experimental treatment]] or [[traditional medicine]], although both can be misused in ways that are alternative.

Alternative medicine is used by a significant number of people, though its popularity is often overstated.&lt;!--&lt;ref name="ConsumerHealth9th"/&gt;--&gt; Large amounts of funding go to testing alternative medicine, with more than US$2.5 [[billion]] spent by the United States government alone.&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/31190909/ |title=$2.5 billion spent, no alternative cures found|date=2009-06-10|work=msnbc.com|access-date=2017-09-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; Almost none show any effect beyond that of [[Placebo|false treatment]],&lt;!--&lt;ref name="$2.5 billion"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Abdulla1999&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abdulla|first1=Sara|title=Phytotherapy – good science or big business?|journal=Nature|date=May 13, 1999|doi=10.1038/news990513-8|quote=Science-based medicine, with its emphasis on controlled study, proof, evidence, statistical significance and safety is being rejected in favour of 'alternative medicine'&amp;nbsp;– an atavistic portmanteau of anecdote, hearsay, rumour and hokum.... Probably the most commercially successful and widely used branch of alternative or complementary medicine is 'phytotherapy'. These are the tablets, powders and elixirs, otherwise known as herbal medicine, that are sold in most countries, through health shops and pharmacies as 'nutritional supplements'.... Only a tiny minority of these remedies have been shown to have mild-to moderately beneficial health effects... So why are affluent, otherwise rational, highly educated people (for this is the average user profile) so hungry for phytotherapy?... people still believe that 'natural' equals good and safe despite plenty of evidence to the contrary." ... as far as the human body is concerned, 'natural' is meaningless... Equally, what's so safe about consuming substances that need meet no standards of contents? ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; and most studies showing any effect have been statistical flukes.&lt;!-- Ernst meta-analysis--&gt; Alternative medicine is a highly profitable industry, with a strong lobby. This fact is often overlooked by media or intentionally kept hidden, with alternative practice being portrayed positively when compared to [[Big Pharma conspiracy theory|"big pharma"]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name="ConsumerHealth9th" /&gt; --&gt; The lobby has successfully pushed for alternative therapies to be subject to far less regulation than conventional medicine.&lt;!--&lt;ref name="ConsumerHealth9th" /&gt;--&gt; Alternative therapies may even be allowed to promote use when there is demonstrably no effect, only a tradition of use. Regulation and licensing of alternative medicine and [[health care provider]]s varies between and within countries. Despite laws making it illegal to market or promote alternative therapies for use in cancer treatment, many practitioners promote them.&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancers-in-general/treatment/complementary-alternative/|title=Complementary and alternative therapies – Cancer in general |publisher= Cancer Research UK|website=www.cancerresearchuk.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uclh.nhs.uk/OurServices/ServiceA-Z/INTMED/IMCAN/Pages/Home.aspx|title=Complementary cancer care service|website=www.uclh.nhs.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; Alternative medicine is criticized for taking advantage of the weakest members of society.&lt;!--&lt;ref name="ConsumerHealth9th"/&gt;--&gt;

== Definitions and terminology ==

=== Alternative medicine ===
'''Alternative medicine''' is defined loosely as a set of products, practices, and theories that are believed or perceived by their users to have the healing effects of [[medicine]],{{refn|name=NSFquote|group=n|"[A]lternative medicine refers to all treatments that have not been proven effective using scientific methods."&lt;ref name=NSF_2002/&gt;}}{{refn|"Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a broad domain of resources that encompasses health systems, modalities, and practices and their accompanying theories and beliefs, other than those intrinsic to the dominant health system of a particular society or culture in a given historical period. CAM includes such resources perceived by their users as associated with positive health outcomes. Boundaries within CAM and between the CAM domain and the domain of the dominant system are not always sharp or fixed."{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|p=19}}|name=IOMquote|group=n}} but whose [[efficacy|effectiveness]] has not been clearly established using [[scientific method]]s,{{refn|name=NSFquote|group=n}}{{refn|name=Angellquote|group=n|"It is time for the scientific community to stop giving alternative medicine a free ride.

Most of these practices are used together with conventional therapies and therefore have been called complementary to distinguish them from alternative practices, those used as a substitute for standard care. ... Until a decade ago or so, "complementary and alternative medicine" could be defined as practices that are neither taught in medical schools nor reimbursed, but this definition is no longer workable, since medical students increasingly seek and receive some instruction about complementary health practices, and some practices are reimbursed by third-party payers. Another definition, practices that lack an evidence base, is also not useful, since there is a growing body of research on some of these modalities, and some aspects of standard care do not have a strong evidence base."{{sfn|Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|2015|loc=chpt. 14-E|p=1}}}}{{refn |name=WebMD2014quote |group=n |"An alternative medical system is a set of practices based on a philosophy different from Western biomedicine."&lt;ref name=WebMD2014/&gt;}}{{refn |group=n |name=NCCIH2quote |"CAM is a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine."&lt;ref name=NCCIH2/&gt;}} or whose theories or practices are directly contradicted by [[scientific evidence]] or [[science|scientific principles]] used in biomedicine.&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hines_Sampson_Coulter_Sagan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AMCER" /&gt; "Biomedicine" or "medicine" is that part of [[medical science]] that applies principles of [[biology]], [[physiology]], [[molecular biology]], [[biophysics]], and other [[natural science]]s to [[clinical practice]], using scientific methods to establish the effectiveness of that practice. Unlike medicine,{{refn|name=Harrisonquote|group=n}} an alternative product or practice does not originate from using scientific methods, but may instead be based on [[testimonial|hearsay]], [[religion]], tradition, [[superstition]], belief in [[supernatural]] energies, [[pseudoscience]], [[fallacy|errors in reasoning]], [[propaganda]], [[fraud]], or other unscientific sources.{{refn|name=Angellquote|group=n}}&lt;ref name="NSF_2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hines_Sampson_Coulter_Sagan" /&gt;

In ''General Guidelines for Methodologies on Research and Evaluation of Traditional Medicine'', published in 2000 by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), complementary and alternative medicine were defined as a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own tradition and are not integrated into the dominant health care system.&lt;ref name="WHO_Trad_Med_Defs" /&gt;{{sfn|WHO|2000}}

The expression also refers to a diverse range of related and unrelated products, practices, and theories ranging from biologically plausible practices and products and practices with some evidence, to practices and theories that are directly contradicted by basic science or clear evidence, and products that have been conclusively proven to be ineffective or even toxic and harmful.{{refn|group=n|name=IOMquote}}&lt;ref name="CAM_Sointu_Nissen_Eisenberg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DaguptaHStabler2011" /&gt;

The terms ''alternative medicine'', ''complementary medicine'', ''integrative medicine,'' ''holistic medicine'', ''natural medicine'', ''unorthodox medicine'', ''fringe medicine'', ''unconventional medicine'', and ''[[new age]] medicine'' are used interchangeably as having the same meaning and are almost synonymous in most contexts.&lt;ref name="Shapiro 08"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ib_IbOu_d9gC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1|title=Suckers: How Alternative Medicine Makes Fools of Us All|last=Shapiro|first=Rose|date=2010-09-30|publisher=Random House |isbn=9781409059165}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bombardieri2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shuval2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Freedman2011" /&gt;

[[File:Marcia.angell.jpg|thumb|[[Marcia Angell]]: "There cannot be two kinds of medicine&amp;nbsp;– conventional and alternative".]]

The meaning of the term "alternative" in the expression "alternative medicine", is not that it is an effective alternative to [[medical science]], although some alternative medicine promoters may use the loose terminology to give the appearance of effectiveness.&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kolata"&gt;{{Citation|last=Kolata|first=Gina|title=On Fringes of Health Care, Untested Therapies Thrive|date=June 17, 1996|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/17/us/on-fringes-of-health-care-untested-therapies-thrive.html?pagewanted=all|author-link=Gina Kolata|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=December 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loose terminology may also be used to suggest meaning that a dichotomy exists when it does not, e.g., the use of the expressions "western medicine" and "eastern medicine" to suggest that the difference is a cultural difference between the Asiatic east and the European west, rather than that the difference is between [[evidence-based medicine]] and treatments that do not work.&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;

{{anchor|Allopathic medicine|Allopathy}}

==="Allopathic medicine"===
{{main|Allopathic medicine}}
''Allopathic medicine'' or ''allopathy'' is an expression commonly used by [[Homeopathy|homeopaths]] and proponents of other forms of alternative medicine to refer to [[medicine|mainstream medicine]]. It was used to describe the traditional European practice of [[heroic medicine]],&lt;ref name="ConsumerHealth9th"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/758098687|title=Consumer health : a guide to intelligent decisions|last1=Barrett|first1=Stephen|last2=London|first2=William M.|last3=Kroger|first3=Manfred|last4=Hall|first4=Harriet|last5=Baratz|first5=Robert S.|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2013|isbn=9780078028489|edition=9th|location=New York|pages=34–35, 134, 137|oclc=758098687}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later continued to be used to describe anything that was not homeopathy.&lt;ref name="ConsumerHealth9th"/&gt;

Allopathy refers to the use of pharmacologically active [[Active ingredient|agents]] or [[Surgery|physical interventions]] to treat or suppress [[symptoms]] or [[pathophysiology|pathophysiologic]] processes of diseases or conditions.&lt;ref name="FREEDICT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/allopathy |website=The Free Dictionary |publisher=Farlex |title=Definition {{ndash}} allopathy |accessdate=25 October 2013}} Citing: ''Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine'' (2008) and ''Mosby's Medical Dictionary'', 8th ed. (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  The German version of the word, {{em|allopathisch}}, was coined in 1810 by the creator of [[homeopathy]], [[Samuel Hahnemann]] (1755–1843).&lt;ref name="Whorton2003" /&gt; The word was coined from {{em|allo-}} (different) and {{em|-pathic}} (relating to a disease or to a method of treatment).&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|allopathic|id=5407}}&lt;/ref&gt; In alternative medicine circles the expression "allopathic medicine" is still used to refer to "the broad category of medical practice that is sometimes called Western medicine, [[biomedicine]], [[evidence-based medicine]], or modern medicine" (see the article on [[scientific medicine]]).&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2001/WHO_EDM_TRM_2001.2.pdf |title=Legal Status of Traditional Medicine and Complementary/Alternative Medicine: A Worldwide Review |accessdate=2007-09-12 |year=2001|author=Xiaorui Zhang|publisher=| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070926083307/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2001/WHO_EDM_TRM_2001.2.pdf |archivedate= 26 September 2007 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CAM===
CAM is an abbreviation of complementary and alternative medicine.&lt;ref name="ernstinterview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CassilethDeng2004" /&gt; It has also been called sCAM or SCAM with the addition of "so-called" or "supplements".&lt;ref name="skepdic.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tyreman 209–17"/&gt; The words balance and holism are often used, claiming to take into account a "whole" person, in contrast to the supposed reductionism of medicine. Due to its many names the field has been criticized for intense [[rebranding]] of what are essentially the same practices: as soon as one name is declared synonymous with [[quackery]], a new name is chosen.&lt;ref name="Shapiro 08" /&gt;

===Traditional medicine===
{{main|Traditional medicine}}
'''Traditional medicine''' refers to the pre-scientific practices of a certain culture, contrary to what is typically practiced in other cultures where medical science dominates.

"[[Eastern medicine]]" typically refers to the traditional medicines of Asia where conventional bio-medicine penetrated much later.

=== Holistic medicine ===

The words ''balance'' and ''holism'' are often used alongside ''complementary'' or ''integrative'' medicine, claiming to take into account a "whole" person, in contrast to the supposed reductionism of medicine. Due to its many names the field has been criticized for intense [[rebranding]] of what are essentially the same practices.&lt;ref name="Shapiro 08" /&gt;

=== Problems with definition ===

Prominent members of the science&lt;ref name="Offit2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawkins2003a" /&gt; and biomedical science community&lt;ref name="Angell1998" /&gt; say that it is not meaningful to define an alternative medicine that is separate from a conventional medicine, that the expressions "conventional medicine", "alternative medicine", "complementary medicine", "integrative medicine",  and "holistic medicine" do not refer to any medicine at all.&lt;ref name="Offit2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Angell1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawkins2003a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fontanarosa1998" /&gt;

Others in both the biomedical and CAM communities say that CAM ''cannot'' be precisely defined because of the diversity of theories and practices it includes, and because the boundaries between CAM and biomedicine overlap, are porous, and change.{{sfn|Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|2015|loc=chpt. 14-E|p=1}}{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|pp=14–20}} The expression "complementary and alternative medicine" (CAM) resists easy definition because the health systems and practices it refers to are diffuse, and its boundaries poorly defined.&lt;ref name="CAM_Sointu_Nissen_Eisenberg" /&gt;{{sfn|Ruggie|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ViDwi7s2VvMC&amp;pg=PA20 20]}}{{refn|group=n|Mary Ruggie in Chapter 2 of ''Marginal to Mainstream: Alternative Medicine in America'' said, "By the mid-1990s, the notion that some alternative therapies could be complementary to conventional medicine began to change the status of...alternative medicine. The 21st century is witnessing yet another terminological innovation, in which CAM and conventional medicine are becoming integrative."{{sfn|Ruggie|2004}}}} Healthcare practices categorized as alternative may differ in their historical origin, theoretical basis, [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic technique]], [[therapy|therapeutic practice]] and in their relationship to the medical mainstream.{{sfn|Sointu|2012|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=XC2UUP36bjAC&amp;pg=PA13 13]}} Some alternative therapies, including [[traditional Chinese medicine|traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)]] and [[Ayurveda]], have antique origins in East or South Asia and are entirely alternative medical systems;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sointu|2012|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=XC2UUP36bjAC&amp;pg=PA13 13]}}. {{harvnb |IOM Report |2005|p=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&amp;page=18 18]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; others, such as homeopathy and chiropractic, have origins in Europe or the United States and emerged in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.{{sfn |Gevitz |1997 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZIqk31BXpksC&amp;pg=PA603 603–33]}} Some, such as [[osteopathy]] and chiropractic, employ manipulative physical methods of treatment; others, such as [[meditation]] and [[prayer]], are based on [[mind-body intervention]]s.{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|p=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&amp;page=18 18]}} Treatments considered alternative in one location may be considered conventional in another.&lt;ref name="Nissen2013" /&gt; Thus, chiropractic is not considered alternative in Denmark and likewise [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic medicine]] is no longer thought of as an alternative therapy in the United States.&lt;ref name="Nissen2013" /&gt;

Critics say the expression is deceptive because it implies there is an effective alternative to science-based medicine, and that ''complementary'' is deceptive because it implies that the treatment increases the effectiveness of (complements) science-based medicine, while alternative medicines that have been tested nearly always have no measurable positive effect compared to a [[placebo]].&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Skep_Dic_comp_med" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Novella2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gorski2010" /&gt;

===Different types of definitions===
One common feature of all definitions of alternative medicine is its designation as "other than" conventional medicine.{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|p=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&amp;page=14 14]}} For example, the widely referenced{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|p=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&amp;page=19 19]}} descriptive definition of complementary and alternative medicine devised by the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine|US National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)]] of the [[National Institutes of Health|National Institutes of Health (NIH)]], states that it is "a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine".&lt;ref name="NCCIH1" /&gt; For conventional medical practitioners, it does not necessarily follow that either it or its practitioners would no longer be considered alternative.{{refn|group=n|As David J.

Hershey Medical Center|Penn State College of Medicine]],&lt;ref name=HuffordUPenn/&gt; has argued: "Simply because an herbal remedy comes to be used by physicians does not mean that herbalists cease to practice, or that the practice of the one becomes like that of the other."&lt;ref name=Hufford2004a/&gt;}}

Some definitions seek to specify alternative medicine in terms of its social and political marginality to mainstream healthcare.&lt;ref name="Saks1992" /&gt; This can refer to the lack of support that alternative therapies receive from the medical establishment and related bodies regarding access to [[Medical research#Funding|research funding]], sympathetic coverage in the [[Medical literature|medical press]], or inclusion in the standard [[Medical education|medical curriculum]].&lt;ref name="Saks1992" /&gt; In 1993, the [[British Medical Association|British Medical Association (BMA)]], one among many professional organizations who have attempted to define alternative medicine, stated that it{{refn|group=n|The BMA used the term non-conventional medicine instead of alternative medicine.&lt;ref name=BMA_1993_1st/&gt;}} referred to "...those forms of treatment which are not widely used by the conventional healthcare professions, and the skills of which are not taught as part of the undergraduate curriculum of conventional medical and paramedical healthcare courses".&lt;ref name="BMA_1993_1st" /&gt; In a US context, an influential definition coined in 1993 by the Harvard-based physician,&lt;ref name="Artus2007" /&gt; David M. Eisenberg,&lt;ref name="Eisenberg_Bio" /&gt; characterized alternative medicine "as interventions neither taught widely in medical schools nor generally available in US hospitals".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eisenberg et al.|1993}}. {{harvnb|Eisenberg et al.|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These descriptive definitions are inadequate in the present-day when some conventional doctors offer alternative medical treatments and CAM introductory courses or modules can be offered as part of standard undergraduate medical training;&lt;ref name="HOL_Kopelman_Wieland_Astin_Pelletier" /&gt; alternative medicine is taught in more than 50 per cent of [[Medical school in the United States|US medical schools]] and increasingly [[Health insurance in the United States|US health insurers]] are willing to provide reimbursement for CAM therapies.{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|pp=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&amp;page=17 17], [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&amp;page=196 196–252]}} In 1999, 7.7% of US hospitals reported using some form of CAM therapy; this proportion had risen to 37.7% by 2008.&lt;ref name="Salomonsen_AHA" /&gt;

An expert panel at a conference hosted in 1995 by the US Office for Alternative Medicine (OAM),&lt;ref name="Wieland2011" /&gt;{{refn|group=n|The Office for Alternative Medicine, part of the National Institutes of Health, was renamed NCCAM in 1998.&lt;ref name=FDA_regulatory/&gt;}} devised a [[theoretical definition]]&lt;ref name="Wieland2011" /&gt; of alternative medicine as "a broad domain of healing resources&amp;nbsp;... other than those intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society or culture in a given historical period".&lt;ref name="CAM_RMC1997" /&gt; This definition has been widely adopted by CAM researchers,&lt;ref name="Wieland2011" /&gt; cited by official government bodies such as the UK Department of Health,&lt;ref name="UKDoH_CAM" /&gt; attributed as the definition used by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]],&lt;ref name="ZollChanCoulRobeAdamArtu" /&gt; and, with some modification,{{dubious|date=June 2015}} was preferred in the 2005 consensus report of the [[Institute of Medicine|US Institute of Medicine]], ''Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States''.{{refn|group=n|name=IOMquote}}

The 1995 OAM conference definition, an expansion of Eisenberg's 1993 formulation, is silent regarding questions of the medical effectiveness of alternative therapies.&lt;ref name="Hufford2004" /&gt; Its proponents hold that it thus avoids [[relativism]] about differing forms of medical knowledge and, while it is an essentially political definition, this should not imply that the dominance of mainstream [[biomedicine]] is solely due to political forces.&lt;ref name="Hufford2004" /&gt; According to this definition, alternative and [[medicine|mainstream medicine]] can only be differentiated with reference to what is "intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society of culture".&lt;ref name="Kopelman2004" /&gt; However, there is neither a reliable method to distinguish between cultures and [[subculture]]s, nor to attribute them as dominant or subordinate, nor any accepted criteria to determine the dominance of a cultural entity.&lt;ref name="Kopelman2004" /&gt; If the culture of a politically dominant healthcare system is held to be equivalent to the perspectives of those charged with the medical management of leading healthcare institutions and programs, the definition fails to recognize the potential for division either within such an elite or between a healthcare elite and the wider population.&lt;ref name="Kopelman2004" /&gt;

[[Normative]] definitions distinguish alternative medicine from the biomedical mainstream in its provision of therapies that are unproven, unvalidated, or ineffective and support of theories with no recognized scientific basis.{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|p=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&amp;page=17 17]}} These definitions characterize practices as constituting alternative medicine when, used independently or in place of [[evidence-based medicine]], they are put forward as having the healing effects of medicine, but are not based on [[evidence]] gathered with the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name="NSF_2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Angell1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NCI_PDQ_CAM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Borkan2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NCCIH1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kong2005" /&gt; Exemplifying this perspective, a 1998 editorial co-authored by [[Marcia Angell]], a former editor of ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'', argued that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is time for the scientific community to stop giving alternative medicine a free ride. There cannot be two kinds of medicine&amp;nbsp;– conventional and alternative. There is only medicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not, medicine that works and medicine that may or may not work. Once a treatment has been tested rigorously, it no longer matters whether it was considered alternative at the outset. If it is found to be reasonably safe and effective, it will be accepted. But assertions, speculation, and testimonials do not substitute for evidence. Alternative treatments should be subjected to scientific testing no less rigorous than that required for conventional treatments.&lt;ref name="Angell1998" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This line of division has been subject to criticism, however, as not all forms of standard medical practice have adequately demonstrated evidence of benefit,{{refn|name=Harrisonquote|group=n}}&lt;ref name="Ezzo2001" /&gt;{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|pp=17–18}} and it is also unlikely in most instances that conventional therapies, if proven to be ineffective, would ever be classified as CAM.&lt;ref name="Wieland2011" /&gt;

Similarly, the public information website maintained by the [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] (NHMRC) of the Commonwealth of Australia uses the acronym "CAM" for a wide range of health care practices, therapies, procedures and devices not within the domain of conventional medicine. In the Australian context this is stated to include acupuncture; aromatherapy; chiropractic; homeopathy; massage; meditation and relaxation therapies; naturopathy; osteopathy; reflexology, traditional Chinese medicine; and the use of vitamin supplements.&lt;ref name="NHMRC_CAM" /&gt;

The [[National Board of Health (Denmark)|Danish National Board of Health's]] "Council for Alternative Medicine" (Sundhedsstyrelsens Råd for Alternativ Behandling (SRAB)), an independent institution under the National Board of Health (Danish: ''Sundhedsstyrelsen''), uses the term "alternative medicine" for:
* Treatments performed by therapists that are not authorized healthcare professionals.
* Treatments performed by authorized healthcare professionals, but those based on methods otherwise used mainly outside the healthcare system. People without a healthcare authorisation are [also] allowed to perform the treatments.&lt;ref name="VIFAB_definition" /&gt;

Alternative medical systems may be based on [[traditional medicine]] practices, such as [[traditional Chinese medicine]] (TCM), [[Ayurveda]] in India, or practices of other cultures around the world.&lt;ref name="NCCIH1" /&gt; Some useful applications of traditional medicines have been researched and accepted within ordinary medicine, however the underlying belief systems are seldom scientific and are not accepted.

Traditional medicine is considered alternative when it is used outside its home region; or when it is used together with or instead of known functional treatment; or when it can be reasonably expected that the patient or practitioner knows or should know that it will not work – such as knowing that the practice is based on superstition.

Since ancient times, in many parts of the world a number of herbs reputed to possess abortifacient properties have been used in [[folk medicine]]. Among these are: [[tansy]], [[Mentha pulegium|pennyroyal]], [[black cohosh]], and the now-extinct [[silphium]].&lt;ref name="riddle2"&gt;{{Cite book|first=John M. |last=Riddle |title=Eve's herbs: a history of contraception and abortion in the West |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] |year=1997|isbn=9780674270244 |oclc=36126503}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44–47, 62–63, 154–55, 230–31}} Historian of science [[Ann Hibner Koblitz]] has written of the probable [[Protoscience|protoscientific]] origins of this folk knowledge in observation of farm animals.  Women who knew that grazing on certain plants would cause an animal to abort (with negative economic consequences for the farm) would be likely to try out those plants on themselves in order to avoid an unwanted pregnancy.&lt;ref name="ahk"&gt;{{cite book | last=Koblitz | first=Ann Hibner | title=Sex and Herbs and Birth Control: Women and Fertility Regulation Through the Ages | publisher=Kovalevskaia Fund | year=2014 | isbn=9780989665506}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|120}}

However, modern users of these plants often lack knowledge of the proper preparation and dosage.  The historian of medicine [[John M. Riddle|John Riddle]] has spoken of the "broken chain of knowledge" caused by urbanization and modernization,&lt;ref name="riddle2" /&gt;{{rp|167–205}} and Koblitz has written that "folk knowledge about effective contraception techniques often disappears over time or becomes inextricably mixed with useless or harmful practices."&lt;ref name="ahk" /&gt;{{rp|vii}}  The ill-informed or indiscriminant use of herbs as abortifacients can cause serious and even lethal side-effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Sullivan | first1=John B. | last2=et al. | title=Pennyroyal oil poisoning and hepatoxicity | journal=Journal of the American Medical Association | year=1979|volume=242|issue=26|pages=2873–74|doi=10.1001/jama.1979.03300260043027}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Ciganda C, Laborde A |title=Herbal infusions used for induced abortion |journal=Journal of Toxicology: Clinical Toxicology |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=235–39 |year=2003 |pmid=12807304 |doi=10.1081/CLT-120021104 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Ayurveda]]
|Traditional medicine of India. Ayurveda believes in the existence of three elemental substances, the [[Ayurveda#Tridosha system|doshas]] (called Vata, Pitta and Kapha), and states that a balance of the doshas results in health, while imbalance results in disease. Such disease-inducing imbalances can be adjusted and balanced using traditional herbs, minerals and heavy metals. Ayurveda stresses the use of plant-based medicines and treatments, with some animal products, and added minerals, including [[sulfur]], [[arsenic]], [[lead]] and [[copper sulfate]]{{Clarify|date=October 2017}}.
|Safety concerns have been raised about Ayurveda, with two U.S. studies finding about 20 percent of Ayurvedic Indian-manufactured [[patent medicine]]s contained toxic levels of heavy metals such as [[lead]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[arsenic]]. A 2015 study of users in the United States also found elevated blood lead levels in 40 percent of those tested.  Other concerns include the use of herbs containing toxic compounds and the lack of quality control in Ayurvedic facilities. Incidents of [[heavy metal poisoning]] have been attributed to the use of these compounds in the United States.{{sfn|Wujastyk|2003|p=xviii}}{{sfn|Mishra|2004|p=8}}&lt;ref name="DaguptaHStabler2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Valiathan2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CDC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saper2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hall|first1=Harriet|title=Ayurveda: Ancient Superstition, Not Ancient Wisdom|url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/ayurveda_ancient_superstition_not_ancient_wisdom|website=Skeptical Inquirer|accessdate=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Breeher L, Mikulski MA, Czeczok T, Leinenkugel K, Fuortes LJ|title=A cluster of lead poisoning among consumers of Ayurvedic medicine|journal=International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health|date=6 Apr 2015|volume=4|issue=4|pages=303–07|doi=10.1179/2049396715Y.0000000009|pmid=25843124|pmc=4727589}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NCCIH classification ===
A US agency, National Center on Complementary and Integrative Health ([[NCCIH]]), has created a classification system for branches of complementary and alternative medicine that divides them into five major groups. These groups have some overlap, and distinguish  two types of [[energy]] medicine: ''veritable'' which involves scientifically observable energy (including [[magnet therapy]], [[colorpuncture]] and [[light therapy]]) and ''putative'', which invokes physically undetectable or unverifiable energy.&lt;ref name="NCCIH_EMed" /&gt; None of these energies have any evidence to support that they effect the body in any positive or health promoting way.&lt;ref name="ConsumerHealth9th"/&gt;

# Whole medical systems: Cut across more than one of the other groups; examples include traditional Chinese medicine, naturopathy, homeopathy, and ayurveda.
# Mind-body interventions: Explore the interconnection between the mind, body, and spirit, under the premise that they affect "bodily functions and symptoms". A connection between mind and body is conventional medical fact, and this classification does not include therapies with proven function such as [[cognitive behavioral therapy]].
# "Biology"-based practices: Use substances found in nature such as herbs, foods, vitamins, and other natural substances.

{{Main|History of alternative medicine}}
The history of alternative medicine may refer to the history of a group of diverse medical practices that were collectively promoted as "alternative medicine" beginning in the 1970s, to the collection of individual histories of members of that group, or to the history of western medical practices that were labeled "irregular practices" by the western medical establishment.&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="QMHCHF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CHBHAMA"&gt;Countercultural Healing: A brief History of Alternavie Medicine in America, James Whorton, [[PBS]], November 4, 2003, [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/altmed/clash/history.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NCHAMA"&gt;Nature Cures &amp;nbsp;– The History of Alternative Medicine in America, James C.

Before the 1970s, western practitioners that were not part of the increasingly science-based medical establishment were referred to "irregular practitioners", and were dismissed by the medical establishment as unscientific and as practicing [[quackery]].&lt;ref name="QMHCHF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CHBHAMA" /&gt; Until the 1970s, irregular practice became increasingly marginalized as [[quackery]] and fraud, as western medicine increasingly incorporated scientific methods and discoveries, and had a corresponding increase in success of its treatments.&lt;ref name="NCHAMA" /&gt; In the 1970s, irregular practices were grouped with traditional practices of nonwestern cultures and with other unproven or disproven practices that were not part of biomedicine, with the entire group collectively marketed and promoted under the single expression "alternative medicine".&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="QMHCHF"&gt;Quack Medicine: A History of Combating Health Fraud in Twentieth-Century America, Eric W.

Use of alternative medicine in the west began to rise following the [[counterculture movement]] of the 1960s, as part of the rising [[new age movement]] of the 1970s.&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The New Age of Alternative Medicine, Why New Age Medicine Is Catching On, Claudia Wallis, Time Magazine, 11-4-1991, [http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19911104,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ENAB"&gt;New Age Medicine, Encyclopedia of New Age Beliefs; John Ankerberg, John Weldon, 1996, pp. 470–508, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SghdYBbMds0C&amp;pg=PA479&amp;lpg=PA479]&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to misleading [[mass marketing]] of "alternative medicine" being an effective "alternative" to biomedicine, changing social attitudes about not using [[chemicals]] and challenging [[the establishment]] and [[authority]] of any kind, sensitivity to giving equal measure to beliefs and practices of other cultures ([[cultural relativism]]), and growing frustration and desperation by patients about limitations and [[side effect]]s of [[science-based medicine]].&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CHBHAMA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NCHAMA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RRCAM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FrontlineAF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ENAB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AMBMJ" /&gt; At the same time, in 1975, the [[American Medical Association]], which played the central role in fighting quackery in the United States, abolished its quackery committee and closed down its Department of Investigation.&lt;ref name="QMHCHF" /&gt;{{rp|xxi}}&lt;ref name="AMBMJ"&gt;{{cite journal |quote=One of the few growth industries in contemporary Britain is alternative medicine.

=== Medical education ===
Mainly as a result of reforms following the Flexner Report of 1910&lt;ref name="Flexner_Report" /&gt; [[medical education]] in established [[medical schools]] in the US has generally not included alternative medicine as a teaching topic.{{refn|group=n|As the medical professor [[Kenneth Ludmerer|Kenneth M. Ludmerer]] noted in 2010: "Flexner pointed out that the scientific method of thinking applied to medical practice. By scientific method, he meant testing ideas with well-planned experiments to establish accurate facts. The clinician's diagnosis was equivalent to the scientist's hypothesis: both [[medical diagnosis]] and hypothesis required the test of an experiment. Flexner argued that mastery of the scientific method of problem solving was the key for physicians to manage medical uncertainty and to practice in the most cost-effective way."&lt;ref name=Ludmerer2010/&gt;}} Typically, their teaching is based on current practice and scientific knowledge about: anatomy, physiology, histology, embryology, neuroanatomy, pathology, pharmacology, microbiology and immunology.&lt;ref name="Bianco" /&gt; Medical schools' teaching includes such topics as doctor-patient communication, ethics, the art of medicine,&lt;ref name="Stanford_Curriculum" /&gt; and engaging in complex clinical reasoning (medical decision-making).&lt;ref name="Yale_Curriculum" /&gt; Writing in 2002, Snyderman and Weil remarked that by the early twentieth century the Flexner model had helped to create the 20th-century academic health center, in which education, research, and practice were inseparable. While this had much improved medical practice by defining with increasing certainty the [[pathophysiological]] basis of disease, a single-minded focus on the pathophysiological had diverted much of mainstream American medicine from clinical conditions that were not well understood in mechanistic terms, and were not effectively treated by conventional therapies.&lt;ref name="Snyderman2002" /&gt;

By 2001 some form of CAM training was being offered by at least 75 out of 125 medical schools in the US.&lt;ref name="Berman2001" /&gt; Exceptionally, the School of Medicine of the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore]] includes a research institute for integrative medicine (a member entity of the Cochrane Collaboration).&lt;ref name="UM_CAM_Field" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UM_CIM" /&gt; Medical schools are responsible for conferring medical degrees, but a physician typically may not legally practice medicine until licensed by the local government authority. Licensed [[physicians in the United States|physicians in the US]] who have attended one of the established medical schools there have usually graduated Doctor of Medicine (MD).&lt;ref name="Medline_MD" /&gt; All states require that applicants for MD licensure be graduates of an approved medical school and complete the [[United States Medical Licensing Examination|United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE)]].&lt;ref name="Medline_MD" /&gt;

== Efficacy ==
There is a general scientific consensus that alternative therapies lack the requisite [[scientific validation]], and their [[efficacy|effectiveness]] is either [[Scientific method|unproved]] or [[Scientific evidence|disproved]].&lt;ref name="NSF_2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kent1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldrosen2004" /&gt; Many of the claims regarding the efficacy of alternative medicines are controversial, since research on them is frequently of low quality and methodologically flawed.{{sfn|IOM Report|2005}} [[Publication bias|Selective publication bias]], marked differences in product quality and standardisation, and some companies making unsubstantiated claims call into question the claims of efficacy of isolated examples where there is evidence for alternative therapies.&lt;ref name="Sarris2012" /&gt;

''The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine'' points to confusions in the general population&amp;nbsp;– a person may attribute symptomatic relief to an otherwise-ineffective therapy just because they are taking something (the placebo effect); the natural recovery from or the cyclical nature of an illness (the [[regression fallacy]]) gets misattributed to an alternative medicine being taken; a person not diagnosed with science-based medicine may never originally have had a true illness diagnosed as an alternative disease category.&lt;ref name="Alcock1999" /&gt;

[[Edzard Ernst]] characterized the evidence for many alternative techniques as weak, nonexistent, or negative&lt;ref name="goodbadugly" /&gt; and in 2011 published his estimate that about 7.4% were based on "sound evidence", although he believes that may be an overestimate.&lt;ref name="Ernst2011" /&gt; Ernst has concluded that 95% of the alternative treatments he and his team studied, including acupuncture, herbal medicine, homeopathy, and reflexology, are "statistically indistinguishable from placebo treatments", but he also believes there is something that conventional doctors can usefully learn from the chiropractors and homeopath: this is the therapeutic value of the placebo effect, one of the strangest phenomena in medicine.&lt;ref name="Economist2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HHH2008" /&gt;

In 2003, a project funded by the CDC identified 208 condition-treatment pairs, of which 58% had been studied by at least one [[randomized controlled trial]] (RCT), and 23% had been assessed with a [[meta-analysis]].&lt;ref name="Katz2003" /&gt; According to a 2005 book by a US [[Institute of Medicine]] panel, the number of RCTs focused on CAM has risen dramatically.

{{as of|2005}}, the [[Cochrane Library]] had 145 CAM-related Cochrane systematic reviews and 340 non-Cochrane systematic reviews. An analysis of the conclusions of only the 145 Cochrane reviews was done by two readers. In 83% of the cases, the readers agreed. In the 17% in which they disagreed, a third reader agreed with one of the initial readers to set a rating. These studies found that, for CAM, 38.4% concluded positive effect or possibly positive (12.4%), 4.8% concluded no effect, 0.7% concluded harmful effect, and 56.6% concluded insufficient evidence. An assessment of conventional treatments found that 41.3% concluded positive or possibly positive effect, 20% concluded no effect, 8.1% concluded net harmful effects, and 21.3% concluded insufficient evidence. However, the CAM review used the more developed 2004 Cochrane database, while the conventional review used the initial 1998 Cochrane database.{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|pp=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&amp;page=135 135–36]}}

In the same way as for conventional therapies, drugs, and interventions, it can be difficult to test the efficacy of alternative medicine in [[clinical trial]]s. In instances where an established, effective, treatment for a condition is already available, the [[Helsinki Declaration]] states that withholding such treatment is unethical in most circumstances. Use of standard-of-care treatment in addition to an alternative technique being tested may produce confounded or difficult-to-interpret results.&lt;ref name="Bodeker2002" /&gt;

Cancer researcher [[Andrew J. Vickers]] has stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Contrary to much popular and scientific writing, many [[alternative cancer treatments]] have been investigated in good-quality clinical trials, and they have been shown to be ineffective. The label "unproven" is inappropriate for such therapies; it is time to assert that many alternative cancer therapies have been "disproven".&lt;ref name="Vickers" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Mechanism of action ==

=== Placebo effect ===
A research methods expert and author of ''Snake Oil Science'', [[R. Barker Bausell]], has stated that "it's become politically correct to investigate nonsense."&lt;ref name="$2.5 billion" /&gt; There are concerns that just having NIH support is being used to give unfounded "legitimacy to treatments that are not legitimate."&lt;ref name="Brown2009" /&gt;

Use of placebos to achieve a [[placebo effect]] in integrative medicine has been criticized as, "...diverting research time, money, and other resources from more fruitful lines of investigation in order to pursue a theory that has no basis in biology."&lt;ref name="Novella2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gorski2010" /&gt;

Another critic has argued that academic proponents of [[integrative medicine]] sometimes recommend misleading patients by using known placebo treatments to achieve a placebo effect.{{refn|group=n|As a 2010 article in the ''New England Journal of Medicine'' concluded: &lt;blockquote&gt;real acupuncture treatments were no more effective than sham acupuncture treatments. There was, nevertheless, evidence that both real acupuncture and sham acupuncture were more effective than no treatment, and that acupuncture can be a useful supplement to other forms of conventional therapy for low back pain.&lt;ref name="Berman2010"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}} However, a 2010 survey of family physicians found that 56% of respondents said they had used a placebo in clinical practice as well. Eighty-five percent of respondents believed placebos can have both psychological and physical benefits.&lt;ref name="Kerman2010" /&gt;

[[Integrative medicine]] has been criticized in that its practitioners, trained in science-based medicine, deliberately mislead patients by pretending [[placebo]]s are not. "[[Quackery#Criticism of quackery in academia|quackademic medicine]]" is a pejorative term used for ''[[integrative medicine]]'', which medical professionals consider an infiltration of quackery into academic [[science-based medicine]].&lt;ref name="Gorski2010" /&gt;

An analysis of trends in the criticism of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in five prestigious American medical journals during the period of reorganization within medicine (1965–1999) was reported as showing that the medical profession had responded to the growth of CAM in three phases, and that in each phase, changes in the medical marketplace had influenced the type of response in the journals.&lt;ref name="Winnick2005_2009" /&gt; Changes included relaxed medical licensing, the development of managed care, rising consumerism, and the establishment of the USA Office of Alternative Medicine (later [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]], currently [[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health]]).{{refn|group=n|According to the medical historian [[James Harvey Young]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1991 the Senate Appropriations Committee responsible for funding the National Institutes of Health (NIH) declared itself "not satisfied that the conventional medical community as symbolized at the NIH has fully explored the potential that exists in unconventional medical practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Young |first1= J.H. |title= The Development of the Office of Alternative Medicine in the National Institutes of Health, 1991–1996 |doi= 10.1353/bhm.1998.0110 |journal= Bulletin of the History of Medicine |volume= 72 |issue= 2 |pages= 279–98 |year= 1998 |pmid=  9628052 |pmc= |ref= harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}} In the "condemnation" phase, from the late 1960s to the early 1970s, authors had ridiculed, exaggerated the risks, and petitioned the state to contain CAM; in the "reassessment" phase (mid-1970s through early 1990s), when increased consumer utilization of CAM was prompting concern, authors had pondered whether patient dissatisfaction and shortcomings in conventional care contributed to the trend; in the "integration" phase of the 1990s physicians began learning to work around or administer CAM, and the subjugation of CAM to scientific scrutiny had become the primary means of control.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Use and regulation==

===Appeal===
[[File:"Miracle Cure!" Health Fraud Scams (8528312890).jpg|thumb|Alternative therapies often make bombastic claims, and frequently include anecdotes from healthy-looking individuals claiming successful treatment.]]

Practitioners of complementary medicine usually discuss and advise patients as to available alternative therapies. Patients often express interest in mind-body complementary therapies because they offer a non-drug approach to treating some health conditions.&lt;ref name="Sobel2000"/&gt;

In addition to the social-cultural underpinnings of the popularity of alternative medicine, there are several psychological issues that are critical to its growth. One of the most critical is the placebo effect&amp;nbsp;– a well-established observation in medicine.&lt;ref name="van_Deventer2008"/&gt;  Related to it are similar psychological effects, such as the will to believe,&lt;ref name=Beyerstein /&gt; [[cognitive bias]]es that help maintain self-esteem and promote harmonious social functioning,&lt;ref name=Beyerstein /&gt; and the ''[[post hoc, ergo propter hoc]]'' fallacy.&lt;ref name=Beyerstein /&gt;

====Marketing====
[[File:Edzard ernst.jpg|thumb|right|[[Edzard Ernst]], a leading authority on scientific study of alternative treatments and diagnoses, and the first university professor of Complementary and Alternative Medicine. Here in 2012, promoting his book ''[[Trick or Treatment]]'' co-written with [[Simon Singh]].]]

The popularity of complementary &amp; alternative medicine (CAM) may be related to other factors that [[Edzard Ernst]] mentioned in an interview in ''[[The Independent]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Why is it so popular, then? Ernst blames the providers, customers and the doctors whose neglect, he says, has created the opening into which alternative therapists have stepped. "People are told lies. There are 40 million websites and 39.9 million tell lies, sometimes outrageous lies. They mislead cancer patients, who are encouraged not only to pay their last penny but to be treated with something that shortens their lives. "At the same time, people are gullible. It needs gullibility for the industry to succeed. It doesn't make me popular with the public, but it's the truth.&lt;ref name="Con?"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Paul Offit]] proposed that "alternative medicine becomes quackery" in four ways: by recommending against conventional therapies that are helpful, promoting potentially harmful therapies without adequate warning, draining patients' bank accounts, or by promoting "magical thinking."&lt;ref name=Offit2013/&gt;

[[File:Lemon-906141.jpg|thumb|Friendly and colorful images of herbal treatments may look less threatening or dangerous when compared to conventional medicine. This is an intentional marketing strategy.]]

====Social factors====

Authors have speculated on the socio-cultural and psychological reasons for the appeal of alternative medicines among the minority using them ''in lieu'' of conventional medicine. There are several socio-cultural reasons for the interest in these treatments centered on the low level of [[scientific literacy]] among the public at large and a concomitant increase in [[antiscience|antiscientific]] attitudes and [[new age]] [[mysticism]].&lt;ref name="Beyerstein" /&gt; Related to this are vigorous [[marketing]]&lt;ref name="Weber" /&gt; of extravagant claims by the alternative medical community combined with inadequate media scrutiny and attacks on critics.&lt;ref name="Beyerstein" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beyerstein2001" /&gt;

There is also an increase in [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] toward conventional medicine and pharmaceutical companies, mistrust of traditional authority figures, such as the physician, and a dislike of the current delivery methods of scientific biomedicine, all of which have led patients to seek out alternative medicine to treat a variety of ailments.&lt;ref name="Beyerstein2001" /&gt; Many patients lack access to contemporary medicine, due to a lack of private or public [[health insurance]], which leads them to seek out lower-cost alternative medicine.&lt;ref name="Barnes2004" /&gt; Medical doctors are also aggressively marketing alternative medicine to profit from this market.&lt;ref name="Weber" /&gt;

Patients can be averse to the painful, unpleasant, and sometimes-dangerous [[adverse effect|side effects]] of biomedical treatments. Treatments for severe diseases such as [[cancer]] and [[HIV]] infection have well-known, significant side-effects. Even low-risk medications such as [[antibiotics]] can have potential to cause life-threatening [[anaphylactic]] reactions in a very few individuals. Many medications may cause minor but bothersome symptoms such as cough or upset stomach. In all of these cases, patients may be seeking out alternative treatments to avoid the adverse effects of conventional treatments.&lt;ref name="Beyerstein" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beyerstein2001" /&gt;

===Prevalence of use===

'''Complementary and alternative medicine''' (CAM) has been described as a broad domain of healing resources that encompasses all health systems, modalities, and practices and their accompanying theories and beliefs, other than those intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society or culture in a given historical period. CAM includes all such practices and ideas self-defined by their users as preventing or treating illness or promoting health and well-being. Boundaries within CAM and between the CAM domain and that of the dominant system are not always sharp or fixed.&lt;ref name="Wieland2011" /&gt;{{dubious|date=February 2013}}

According to recent research, the increasing popularity of the CAM needs to be explained by moral convictions or lifestyle choices rather than by economic reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Hélène|last2=Debons|first2=Jérôme|title=CAM and conventional medicine in Switzerland : divided in theory, united in practice. In N. K. Gale &amp; J. V. McHale, Routledge Handbook of Complementary and Alternative Medicine. Perspectives from social science and law|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=London and New York|pages=271–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[developing country|developing nations]], access to essential medicines is severely restricted by lack of resources and [[poverty]]. [[Traditional medicine|Traditional remedies]], often closely resembling or forming the basis for alternative remedies, may comprise primary healthcare or be integrated into the healthcare system. In Africa, traditional medicine is used for 80% of primary healthcare, and in developing nations as a whole over one-third of the population lack access to essential medicines.&lt;ref name="WHO_tradmed_fact" /&gt;

Some have proposed adopting a [[prize]] system to reward medical research.&lt;ref name="Horrobin1986" /&gt; However, public funding for research exists. Increasing the funding for research on alternative medicine techniques is the purpose of the [[US National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]]. NCCIH and its predecessor, the Office of Alternative Medicine, have spent more than US$2.5 billion on such research since 1992; this research has largely not demonstrated the efficacy of alternative treatments.&lt;ref name="$2.5 billion" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nccih_$" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Atwood2003" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2001|title=Stated goals and grants of the Office of Alternative Medicine/National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine|url=|journal=Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine|volume=5|issue=4|pages=205–07|author=Green S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That alternative medicine has been on the rise "in countries where Western science and scientific method generally are accepted as the major foundations for healthcare, and 'evidence-based' practice is the dominant paradigm" was described as an "enigma" in the Medical Journal of Australia.&lt;ref name="Coulter2004" /&gt;

====In the US====

In the United States, the 1974 [[Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act]] (CAPTA) required that for states to receive federal money, they had to grant religious exemptions to [[child neglect]] and [[child abuse|abuse]] laws regarding religion-based healing practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merrick |first=Janna | date=June 2003 |title=Spiritual Healing, Sick Kids and the Law: Inequities in the American Healthcare System |journal=American Journal of Law &amp; Medicine |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=269–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-one states have child-abuse religious exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/define.pdf |title=Definitions of Child Abuse and Neglect |accessdate=2009-02-27 |publisher=Child Welfare Information Gateway |year=2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011062659/http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/define.pdf |archivedate=11 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey of Americans found that 88 percent thought that "there are some good ways of treating sickness that medical science does not recognize".&lt;ref name="NSF_2002" /&gt; Use of magnets was the most common tool in [[energy medicine]] in America, and among users of it, 58 percent described it as at least "sort of [[scientific method|scientific]]", when it is not at all scientific.&lt;ref name="NSF_2002" /&gt; In 2002, at least 60 percent of US medical schools have at least some class time spent teaching alternative therapies.&lt;ref name="NSF_2002" /&gt; "[[Therapeutic touch]]" was taught at more than 100 colleges and universities in 75 countries before the practice was debunked by a nine-year-old child for a school science project.&lt;ref name="NSF_2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rosa" /&gt;

The most common CAM therapies used in the US in 2002 were prayer (45%), [[herbalism]] (19%), [[Terms and concepts in alternative medicine#Breathing Meditation|breathing meditation]] (12%), [[meditation (alternative medicine)|meditation]] (8%), [[chiropractic medicine]] (8%), [[yoga (alternative medicine)|yoga]] (5–6%), [[body work (alternative medicine)|body work]] (5%), [[Terms and concepts in alternative medicine#Diet-based therapy|diet-based therapy]] (4%), [[Terms and concepts in alternative medicine#Progressive Relaxation|progressive relaxation]] (3%), [[Orthomolecular medicine|mega-vitamin therapy]] (3%) and [[Visualization (cam)|Visualization]] (2%)&lt;ref name="Barnes2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barnes2008" /&gt;

In Britain, the most often used alternative therapies were [[Alexander technique]], [[Aromatherapy]], Bach and other flower remedies, Body work therapies including massage, Counseling stress therapies, [[hypnotherapy]], [[Meditation]], [[Reflexology]], [[Shiatsu]], [[Ayurvedic medicine]], Nutritional medicine, and [[Yoga]].{{sfn|Sir Walton: Science and Technology Committee|2000}} Ayurvedic medicine remedies are mainly plant based with some use of animal materials.{{sfn|Wujastyk|2003}} Safety concerns include the use of herbs containing toxic compounds and the lack of quality control in Ayurvedic facilities.&lt;ref name="Valiathan2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saper2008" /&gt;

According to the [[National Health Service (England)]], the most commonly used complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) supported by the NHS in the UK are: acupuncture, aromatherapy, chiropractic, homeopathy, massage, osteopathy and clinical hypnotherapy.&lt;ref name="NHS_Careers_CAM" /&gt;

====In palliative care====

Complementary therapies are often used in [[palliative care]] or by practitioners attempting to manage chronic pain in patients. Integrative medicine is considered more acceptable in the interdisciplinary approach used in palliative care than in other areas of medicine. "From its early experiences of care for the dying, palliative care took for granted the necessity of placing patient values and lifestyle habits at the core of any design and delivery of quality care at the end of life. If the patient desired complementary therapies, and as long as such treatments provided additional support and did not endanger the patient, they were considered acceptable."&lt;ref name="Kellhear2003" /&gt; The non-pharmacologic interventions of complementary medicine can employ [[mind-body intervention|mind-body]] interventions designed to "reduce pain and concomitant mood disturbance and increase quality of life."&lt;ref name="Menefee2005" /&gt;

=== Regulation ===
{{Further|Regulation of alternative medicine | Regulation and prevalence of homeopathy}}{{Expand section|date=May 2018}}[[File:Use Caution With Ayurvedic Products (FDA October 16, 2008).djvu|thumb|Health campaign flyers, as in this example from the [[Food and Drug Administration]], warn the public about unsafe products.]]

In Austria and Germany complementary and alternative medicine is mainly in the hands of doctors with [[Medical degree|MDs]],&lt;ref name=ernstinterview/&gt; and half or more of the American alternative practitioners are licensed MDs.&lt;ref name="Cassileth1996"/&gt; In Germany herbs are tightly regulated: half are prescribed by doctors and covered by health insurance.&lt;ref name="JAMA_book_review"/&gt;

Some professions of complementary/traditional/alternative medicine, such as [[chiropractic]], have achieved full regulation in North America and other parts of the world{{sfn|WHO|2005}} and are regulated in a manner similar to that governing science-based medicine. In contrast, other approaches may be partially recognized and others have no regulation at all. Regulation and licensing of alternative medicine ranges widely from country to country, and state to state.{{sfn|WHO|2005}}

Government bodies in the US and elsewhere have published information or guidance about alternative medicine. The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), has issued online warnings for consumers about medication health fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/MedicationHealthFraud/default.htm|title=Medication Health Fraud|work=fda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes a section on Alternative Medicine Fraud,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/MedicationHealthFraud/ucm207747.htm|title=Alternative Medicine Fraud|work=fda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as a warning that Ayurvedic products generally have not been approved by the FDA before marketing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm050798.htm FDA, ''Use Caution With Ayurvedic Products'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks and problems==

=== Negative outcomes ===
{{See also|List of herbs with known adverse effects}}

====Adequacy of regulation and CAM safety====

Many of the claims regarding the safety and efficacy of alternative medicine are controversial. Some alternative treatments have been associated with unexpected side effects, which can be fatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Niggemann|first1=B.|last2=Grüber|first2=C.|title=Side-effects of complementary and alternative medicine|journal=Allergy|date=22 February 2003|volume=58|issue=8|pages=707–16|doi=10.1034/j.1398-9995.2003.00219.x|pmid=12859546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A commonly voiced concerns about complementary alternative medicine (CAM) is the way it's regulated. There have been significant developments in how CAMs should be assessed prior to re-sale in the United Kingdom and the European Union (EU) in the last 2 years. Despite this, it has been suggested that current regulatory bodies have been ineffective in preventing deception of patients as many companies have re-labelled their drugs to avoid the new laws.&lt;ref name="Colquhoun2012"/&gt;  There is no general consensus about how to balance consumer protection (from false claims, toxicity, and advertising) with freedom to choose remedies.

Advocates of CAM suggest that regulation of the industry will adversely affect patients looking for alternative ways to manage their symptoms, even if many of the benefits may represent the placebo affect.&lt;ref name="Connelly2012"/&gt; Some contend that alternative medicines should not require any more regulation than over-the-counter medicines that can also be toxic in overdose (such as paracetamol).&lt;ref name="Malcolm2012"/&gt;

====Interactions with conventional pharmaceuticals====

Forms of alternative medicine that are biologically active can be dangerous even when used in conjunction with conventional medicine. Examples include immuno-augmentation therapy, shark cartilage, bioresonance therapy, oxygen and ozone therapies, and insulin potentiation therapy. Some herbal remedies can cause dangerous interactions with chemotherapy drugs, radiation therapy, or anesthetics during surgery, among other problems.&lt;ref name=CassilethDeng2004/&gt; An example of these dangers was reported by Associate Professor [[Alastair MacLennan (medicine)|Alastair MacLennan]] of Adelaide University, Australia regarding a patient who almost bled to death on the operating table after neglecting to mention that she had been taking "natural" potions to "build up her strength" before the operation, including a powerful anticoagulant that nearly caused her death.&lt;ref name="Hills1999"/&gt;

To ''ABC Online'', MacLennan also gives another possible mechanism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And lastly there's the cynicism and disappointment and depression that some patients get from going on from one alternative medicine to the next, and they find after three months the placebo effect wears off, and they're disappointed and they move on to the next one, and they're disappointed and disillusioned, and that can create depression and make the eventual treatment of the patient with anything effective difficult, because you may not get compliance, because they've seen the failure so often in the past.&lt;ref name="SwanABC"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Side-effects====

Conventional treatments are subjected to testing for undesired [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side-effects]], whereas alternative treatments, in general, are not subjected to such testing at all. Any treatment&amp;nbsp;– whether conventional or alternative&amp;nbsp;– that has a biological or psychological effect on a patient may also have potential to possess dangerous biological or psychological side-effects. Attempts to refute this fact with regard to alternative treatments sometimes use the ''[[appeal to nature]]'' fallacy, i.e., "That which is natural cannot be harmful." Specific groups of patients such as patients with impaired hepatic or renal function are more susceptible to side effects of alternative remedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Use of herbal remedies among patients undergoing hemodialysis|journal=Iran J Kidney Dis|pmid=24241097|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258636639_Use_of_herbal_remedies_among_patients_undergoing_hemodialysis|volume=7|issue=6|date=Nov 2013|pages=492–95|author1=Roozbeh|first1=J|last2=Hashempur|first2=M. H.|last3=Heydari|first3=M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Herbal products: benefits, limits, and applications in chronic liver disease|journal=Evid Based Complement Alternat Med|pmid=22991573|pmc=3443820|url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2012/837939/|doi=10.1155/2012/837939|volume=2012|year=2012|pages=837939|author1=Del Prete|first1=A|last2=Scalera|first2=A|last3=Iadevaia|first3=M.

An exception to the normal thinking regarding side-effects is [[Homeopathy]]. Since 1938, the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has regulated homeopathic products in "several significantly different ways from other drugs."&lt;ref name=Stehlin/&gt; Homeopathic preparations, termed "remedies", are extremely dilute, often far beyond the point where a single molecule of the original active (and possibly toxic) ingredient is likely to remain. They are, thus, considered safe on that count, but "their products are exempt from good manufacturing practice requirements related to expiration dating and from finished product testing for identity and strength", and their alcohol concentration may be much higher than allowed in conventional drugs.&lt;ref name=Stehlin/&gt;

=====Treatment delay=====

Those having experienced or perceived success with one alternative therapy for a minor ailment may be convinced of its efficacy and persuaded to extrapolate that success to some other alternative therapy for a more serious, possibly life-threatening illness.&lt;ref name="Navarro2006"/&gt; For this reason, critics argue that therapies that rely on the placebo effect to define success are very dangerous. According to mental health journalist Scott Lilienfeld in 2002, "unvalidated or scientifically unsupported mental health practices can lead individuals to forgo effective treatments" and refers to this as "[[opportunity cost]]". Individuals who spend large amounts of time and money on ineffective treatments may be left with precious little of either, and may forfeit the opportunity to obtain treatments that could be more helpful. In short, even innocuous treatments can indirectly produce negative outcomes.&lt;ref name=Lilienfeld2002/&gt; Between 2001 and 2003, four children died in Australia because their parents chose ineffective naturopathic, homeopathic, or other alternative medicines and diets rather than conventional therapies.&lt;ref name=Hughes2010/&gt;

====Unconventional cancer "cures"====

There have always been "many therapies offered outside of conventional cancer treatment centers and based on theories not found in [[biomedicine]]. These alternative cancer cures have often been described as 'unproven,' suggesting that appropriate clinical trials have not been conducted and that the therapeutic value of the treatment is unknown." However, "many alternative cancer treatments have been investigated in good-quality clinical trials, and they have been shown to be ineffective....The label 'unproven' is inappropriate for such therapies; it is time to assert that many alternative cancer therapies have been 'disproven'."&lt;ref name=Vickers/&gt;

[[Edzard Ernst]] has stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...any alternative cancer cure is bogus by definition. There will never be an alternative cancer cure. Why? Because if something looked halfway promising, then mainstream oncology would scrutinize it, and if there is anything to it, it would become mainstream almost automatically and very quickly. All curative "alternative cancer cures" are based on false claims, are bogus, and, I would say, even criminal.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{Citation |last=Miller |first=Gabriel |date=2 September 2014 |title=Asking the Experts: Complementary and Alternative Medicine and Cancer |work=[[Medscape]] |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/830553_print |accessdate=7 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Rejection of science===
{{Reduced pull quote|1=right

}}

"CAM", meaning "complementary and alternative medicine", is not as well researched as conventional medicine, which undergoes intense research before release to the public.&lt;ref name="Ernst_Cohen" /&gt; Funding for research is also sparse making it difficult to do further research for effectiveness of CAM.&lt;ref name="Ernst4" /&gt; Most funding for CAM is funded by government agencies.&lt;ref name="Ernst_Cohen" /&gt; Proposed research for CAM are rejected by most private funding agencies because the results of research are not reliable.&lt;ref name="Ernst_Cohen" /&gt;  The research for CAM has to meet certain standards from research ethics committees, which most CAM researchers find almost impossible to meet.&lt;ref name="Ernst_Cohen" /&gt; Even with the little research done on it, CAM has not been proven to be effective.&lt;ref name="Ernst3" /&gt;

[[Steven Novella]], a neurologist at Yale School of Medicine, wrote that government funded studies of integrating alternative medicine techniques into the mainstream are "used to lend an appearance of legitimacy to treatments that are not legitimate."&lt;ref name="Brown2009" /&gt; Marcia Angell considered that critics felt that healthcare practices should be classified based solely on [[evidence-based medicine|scientific evidence]], and if a treatment had been rigorously tested and found safe and effective, science-based medicine will adopt it regardless of whether it was considered "alternative" to begin with.&lt;ref name="Angell1998" /&gt; It is possible for a method to change categories (proven vs. unproven), based on increased knowledge of its effectiveness or lack thereof. A prominent supporter of this position is [[George D. Lundberg]], former editor of the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] (JAMA).&lt;ref name="Fontanarosa1998" /&gt;

Writing in 1999 in ''CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians'' [[Barrie R. Cassileth]] mentioned a 1997 letter to the [[US Senate]] Subcommittee on Public Health and Safety, which had deplored the lack of critical thinking and scientific rigor in OAM-supported research, had been signed by four Nobel Laureates and other prominent scientists. (This was supported by the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH).)&lt;ref name="Cassileth1999" /&gt;

In March 2009 a staff writer for ''[[the Washington Post]]'' reported that the impending national discussion about broadening access to health care, improving medical practice and saving money was giving a group of scientists an opening to propose shutting down the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]]. They quoted one of these scientists, [[Steven Salzberg]], a genome researcher and computational biologist at the University of Maryland, as saying "One of our concerns is that NIH is funding pseudoscience."  They noted that the vast majority of studies were based on fundamental misunderstandings of [[physiology]] and [[disease]], and had shown little or no effect.&lt;ref name="Brown2009" /&gt;

Writers such as [[Carl Sagan]], a noted astrophysicist, advocate of [[scientific skepticism]] and the author of ''[[The Demon-Haunted World|The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark]]'' (1996), have lambasted the lack of empirical evidence to support the existence of the putative energy fields on which these therapies are predicated.{{sfn|Sagan|1996}}

Sampson has also pointed out that CAM tolerated [[fallacy|contradiction]] without thorough reason and experiment.&lt;ref name="SampsonAtwood2005" /&gt; Barrett has pointed out that there is a policy at the NIH of never saying something doesn't work only that a different version or dose might give different results.&lt;ref name="$2.5 billion" /&gt; Barrett also expressed concern that, just because some "alternatives" have merit, there is the impression that the rest deserve equal consideration and respect even though most are worthless, since they are all classified under the one heading of alternative medicine.&lt;ref name="Quackwatch_wary" /&gt;

Some critics of alternative medicine are focused upon health fraud, misinformation, and quackery as public health problems, notably [[Wallace Sampson]] and [[Paul Kurtz]] founders of [[Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine]] and [[Stephen Barrett]], co-founder of [[The National Council Against Health Fraud]] and webmaster of [[Quackwatch]].&lt;ref name="NCAHF_mission" /&gt; Grounds for opposing alternative medicine include that:
* It is usually based on [[religion]], tradition, [[superstition]], belief in [[supernatural]] energies, [[pseudoscience]], [[fallacy|errors in reasoning]], propaganda, or fraud.&lt;ref name="Beyerstein2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NSF_2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Other_sources" /&gt;
* Alternative therapies typically lack any [[scientific validation]], and their effectiveness is either [[Scientific method|unproved]] or [[Scientific evidence|disproved]].&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kent1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldrosen2004" /&gt;{{dubious|date=January 2013}}
* Treatments are not part of the conventional, science-based healthcare system.&lt;ref name="WHO_Trad_Med_Defs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NCCIH1" /&gt;{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|pp=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&amp;page=17 17–19]}}&lt;ref name="Zollman1999" /&gt;
* Research on alternative medicine is frequently of low quality and methodologically flawed.&lt;ref name="NCCIH1" /&gt;{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|p=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&amp;page=146 146]}}
* Where alternative treatments have replaced conventional science-based medicine, even with the safest alternative medicines, failure to use or delay in using conventional science-based medicine has caused deaths.&lt;ref name="Lilienfeld2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes2010" /&gt;
* Methods may incorporate or base themselves on [[traditional medicine]], [[Home remedy|folk knowledge]], spiritual beliefs, ignorance or misunderstanding of scientific principles, errors in reasoning, or newly conceived approaches claiming to heal.&lt;ref name="Beyerstein2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Acharya2008" /&gt;

Many alternative medical treatments are not [[patent]]able,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} which may lead to less research funding from the private sector. In addition, in most countries, alternative treatments (in contrast to pharmaceuticals) can be marketed without any proof of efficacy&amp;nbsp;– also a disincentive for manufacturers to fund scientific research.&lt;ref name="Ernst2005" /&gt;

English evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]], in his 2003 book ''[[A Devil's Chaplain]]'', defined alternative medicine as a "set of practices that cannot be tested, refuse to be tested, or consistently fail tests."&lt;ref name="Dawkins2003" /&gt; Dawkins argued that if a technique is demonstrated effective in properly performed trials then it ceases to be alternative and simply becomes medicine.&lt;ref name="Holloway2003" /&gt;

CAM is also often less regulated than conventional medicine.&lt;ref name="Ernst_Cohen" /&gt; There are ethical concerns about whether people who perform CAM have the proper knowledge to treat patients.&lt;ref name="Ernst_Cohen" /&gt; CAM is often done by non-physicians who do not operate with the same medical licensing laws which govern conventional medicine,&lt;ref name="Ernst_Cohen" /&gt; and it is often described as an issue of [[non-maleficence]].&lt;ref name="Ernst2" /&gt;

According to two writers, Wallace Sampson and K. Butler, marketing is part of the training required in alternative medicine, and propaganda methods in alternative medicine have been traced back to those used by [[Hitler]] and [[Goebels]] in their promotion of pseudoscience in medicine.&lt;ref name="ATRAMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ButlerBarrett1992" /&gt;

In November 2011 [[Edzard Ernst]] stated that the "level of misinformation about alternative medicine has now reached the point where it has become dangerous and unethical. So far, alternative medicine has remained an ethics-free zone. It is time to change this."&lt;ref name="Ernst_Guardian" /&gt;

=== Conflicts of interest ===

Some commentators have said that special consideration must be given to the issue of [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]] in alternative medicine. [[Edzard Ernst]] has said  that most researchers into alternative medicine are at risk of "unidirectional bias" because of a generally uncritical belief in their chosen subject.&lt;ref name="unid"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ernst E|authorlink=Edzard Ernst|year=2011|title=Conflicts of Interest in Alternative Medicine|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/conflicts_of_interest_in_alternative_medicine|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|volume=35|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ernst cites as evidence the phenomenon whereby 100% of a sample of acupuncture trials originating in China had positive conclusions.&lt;ref name="unid" /&gt; [[David Gorski]] contrasts [[evidence-based medicine]], in which researchers try to disprove hyphotheses, with what he says is the frequent practice in pseudoscience-based research, of striving to confirm pre-existing notions.&lt;ref name="gorski"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/conflicts-of-interest-in-science-based-medicine/|title=Conflicts of interest in science-based medicine|author=Gorski D|authorlink=David Gorski|date=16 November 2009|publisher=[[Science-Based Medicine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harriet Hall]] writes that there is a contrast between the circumstances of alternative medicine practitioners and disinterested scientists: in the case of acupuncture, for example, an acupuncturist would have "a great deal to lose" if acupuncture were rejected by research; but the disinterested skeptic would not lose anything if its effects were confirmed; rather their change of mind would enhance their skeptical credentials.&lt;ref name="hall"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/conflicts-of-interest/|title=Conflicts of interest|author=Hall HA|authorlink=Harriet A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2544">'''Anecdotal cognitivism''' is a psychological methodology that attributes mental states to animals on the basis of anecdotes and on the observation of particular cases, other than those observations made during controlled experiments. It is opposed to [[behaviorism]]; behaviorists are critical of anecdotal cognitivism, suggesting that controlled experiments are necessary to measure stimuli and record observable behavior. 

==Animal cognition==
Anecdotal cognitivism is often criticized by behaviorists using specific cases, such as that of [[Clever Hans]], to discredit using anecdotal evidence in assessing [[animal cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/andrewsk/documents/Keeley_Anthropomorphism.pdf|title=Anthropomorphism, primatomorphism, mammalomorphism: understanding cross-species comparisons|last=Keeley|first=Brian L.|date=2004|publisher=York University|pages=527|accessdate=2008-12-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081217060503/http://www.yorku.ca/andrewsk/documents/Keeley_Anthropomorphism.pdf| archivedate= 17 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Clever Hans, a [[horse]] was purported to be able to add and subtract using its hooves, and even answer questions surrounding [[European politics]], but it was determined by later research that the horse's owner was, in fact, unknowingly cueing the [[horse]], and that when he was removed from the room, the [[horse]] would not respond.

Anecdotal cognitivists respond to behaviorists by saying that [[behaviorism]] would have the animals 'lose their minds' and that it is clear that, by observation, they can know a great deal about the cognitive processes of animals. They add that the debate can start with simple observation, rather than in a controlled setting or in a lab.

Aromatherapists, who specialize in the practice of aromatherapy, utilize blends of therapeutic essential oils that can be issued through topical application, massage, inhalation or water immersion to stimulate a desired response.

There is no good [[evidence-based medicine|medical evidence]] that aromatherapy can either prevent or cure any disease. There is some evidence that it is more effective than placebo in combating postoperative nausea and vomiting, but also that it is less effective than standard anti-emetic drugs. &lt;ref name=acs/&gt;&lt;ref name="HinesEtal"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hines |first1=Sonia |last2=Steels |first2=Elizabeth |last3=Chang |first3=Anne |last4=Gibbons |first4=Kristen |date=2012-04-18 |title=Aromatherapy for treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=2012 |issue=4 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |language=en |doi=10.1002/14651858.cd007598.pub2 |issn=1465-1858 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007598.pub2/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
&lt;!--[[History of aromatherapy]] redirects here--&gt;

The use of essential oils for therapeutic, spiritual, hygienic and ritualistic purposes goes back to a number of ancient civilizations including the Chinese, Indians, Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans who used them in cosmetics, perfumes and drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Maryland Medical Center - Aromatherapy|url=https://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/treatment/aromatherapy|website=University of Maryland Medical Center|publisher=University of Maryland Medical Center|accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Oils were used for aesthetic pleasure and in the beauty industry. It was a luxury item and a means of payment. It was believed the essential oils increased the shelf life of wine and improved the taste of food.

Oils are described by [[Dioscorides]], along with beliefs of the time regarding their healing properties, in his ''[[De Materia Medica]]'', written in the first century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Gunther |editor1-first=R.T. |year=1959 |title=The Greek Herbal of Dioscorides |first1=Pedanius |last1=Dioscorides |authorlink1=Pedanius Dioscorides |first2=John (trans.) |last2=Goodyer |location=New York |publisher=Hafner Publishing |oclc=3570794}}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Distilled essential oils have been employed as medicines since the eleventh century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Forbes |first1=R.J. |year=1970 |title=A short history of the art of distillation |location=Leiden |publisher=E.J.

The concept of aromatherapy was first mooted by a small number of European scientists and doctors, in about{{Weasel inline|date=February 2010}} 1907.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} In 1937, the word first appeared in print in a French book on the subject: ''Aromathérapie: Les Huiles Essentielles, Hormones Végétales'' by [[:fr:René-Maurice Gattefossé|René-Maurice Gattefossé]], a chemist.

Daniel |isbn=0-85207-236-8}}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, Gattefossé burned a hand very badly and later claimed he treated it effectively with lavender oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/aromatherapy-000347.htm |title=Aromatherapy |publisher=University of Maryland Medical Center |accessdate=24 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A French surgeon, [[:fr:Jean Valnet|Jean Valnet]], pioneered the medicinal uses of essential oils, which he used as antiseptics in the treatment of wounded soldiers during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Valnet |first1=J. |last2=Tisserand |first2=R. |year=1990 |title=The practice of aromatherapy: A classic compendium of plant medicines &amp; their healing properties |location=Rochester, VT |publisher=Healing Arts Press |isbn=0-89281-398-9}}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modes of application==
The modes of application of aromatherapy include:
* ''[[Aroma_lamp|Aerial diffusion]]'': for environmental fragrancing or aerial disinfection
* ''Direct inhalation'': for respiratory disinfection, decongestant, expectoration as well as psychological effects
* ''Topical applications'': for general [[massage]], [[bath salts|baths]], compresses, therapeutic skin care&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.plaisirsboutique.com/brand-john-masters-organics.irc |title=Organic Bath Oil |publisher=Plaisirs |accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==
Some of the materials employed include:
* [[Absolute (substance)|Absolutes]]: fragrant oils extracted primarily from flowers or delicate plant tissues through [[solvent]] or [[supercritical fluid]] extraction (e.g., [[rose]] absolute). The term is also used to describe oils extracted from fragrant butters, [[Concrete (extraction)|concrete]]s, and [[enfleurage]] pommades using [[ethanol]].
* [[Aroma lamp]]s or diffusers: an electric or candle-fueled device which volatilizes essential oils, usually mixed with water.
* [[Carrier oil]]s: typically oily plant base [[triacylglyceride]]s that dilute essential oils for use on the skin (e.g., [[almond|sweet almond]] oil).
* [[Essential oil]]s: fragrant oils extracted from plants chiefly through steam [[distillation]] (e.g., [[eucalyptus]] oil) or expression ([[grapefruit]] oil). However, the term is also occasionally used to describe fragrant oils extracted from plant material by any [[solvent extraction]]. This material includes incense reed diffusers. 
* [[Herbal distillate]]s or hydrosols: the aqueous [[by-product]]s of the distillation process (e.g., [[rosewater]]).  Common herbal distillates are [[chamomile]], [[rose]], and [[lemon balm]].
* [[Infusion]]s: aqueous extracts of various plant material (e.g., infusion of [[chamomile]]).
* [[Phytoncide]]s: various [[volatile organic compound]]s from plants that kill [[microbe]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Many [[terpene]]-based fragrant oils and [[sulfur]]ic compounds from plants in the genus "''[[Allium]]''" are phytoncides,{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} though the latter are likely less commonly used in aromatherapy due to their disagreeable [[odor]]s.
* [[Vaporizer (inhalation device)|Vaporizer]]s: typically higher oil content plant based materials dried, crushed, and heated to extract and inhale the aromatic oil vapors in a direct inhalation modality.

==Theory==
Aromatherapy is the treatment or prevention of disease by use of essential oils. Other stated uses include pain and anxiety reduction, enhancement of energy and short-term memory, relaxation, hair loss prevention, and reduction of eczema-induced itching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jennifer A. |last=Kingston |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/29/fashion/29skin.html |title=Nostrums: Aromatherapy Rarely Stands Up to Testing |work=The New York Times |date=28 July 2010 |accessdate=29 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Nagourney |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/11/health/research/11nost.html |title=Skin Deep: In Competition for your Nose |work=The New York Times |date=11 March 2008 |accessdate=29 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/26/health/personal-health-for-aromatherapy-big-claims-little-proof.html|title=PERSONAL HEALTH; For Aromatherapy, Big Claims, Little Proof|last=Brody|first=Jane E.|date=2000-12-26|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2017-02-15|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two basic mechanisms are offered to explain the purported effects. One is the influence of aroma on the brain, especially the [[limbic system]] through the [[olfactory system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/node/1887 |title=The Power of Smell |first=Vandana |last=Mathrani |date=17 January 2008}}{{self-published inline|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other is the direct pharmacological effects of the essential oils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1472-6882-6-39 |year=2006 |last1=Prabuseenivasan |first1=Seenivasan |last2=Jayakumar |first2=Manickkam |last3=Ignacimuthu |first3=Savarimuthu |journal=BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine |volume=6 |pages=39 |pmid=17134518 |title=In vitro antibacterial activity of some plant essential oils |pmc=1693916 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the English-speaking world, practitioners tend to emphasize the use of oils in massage.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Aromatherapy tends to be regarded as a [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] fraud at worst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Barrett |first1=Stephen |url=http://www.srmhp.org/archives/aromatherapy.html |title=Aromatherapy: Making Dollars out of Scents |work=Science &amp; Pseudoscience Review in Mental Health |publisher=Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice |accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Choice and purchase==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
Oils with standardized content of components (marked FCC, for [[Food Chemicals Codex]]) are required{{by whom|date=June 2013}} to contain a specified amount of certain aroma chemicals that normally occur in the oil.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} There is no law that the chemicals cannot be added in synthetic form to meet the criteria established by the FCC for that oil.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} For instance, [[lemongrass]] essential oil must contain 75% [[aldehyde]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} to meet the FCC profile for that oil, but that aldehyde can come from a chemical refinery instead of from lemongrass. To say that FCC oils are "food grade" makes them seem natural when they are not necessarily so.

Undiluted essential oils suitable for aromatherapy are termed 'therapeutic grade', but there are no established and agreed standards for this category.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Analysis using [[gas liquid chromatography]] (GLC) and [[mass spectrometry]] (MS) establishes the quality of essential oils. These techniques are able to measure the levels of components to a few parts per billion.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} This does not make it possible to determine whether each component is natural or whether a poor oil has been 'improved' by the addition of synthetic aromachemicals, but the latter is often signaled by the minor impurities present. For example, [[linalool]] made in plants will be accompanied by a small amount of hydro-linalool, whilst synthetic linalool has traces of dihydro-linalool.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

== Effectiveness ==

There is no good [[evidence-based medicine|medical evidence]] that aromatherapy can prevent or cure any disease.&lt;ref name=acs&gt;{{cite book |publisher=[[American Cancer Society]] |title=American Cancer Society Complete Guide to Complementary and Alternative Cancer Therapies |edition=2nd |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-944235-71-3 |editor=Ades TB |pages=57–60 |chapter=Aromatherapy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the [[Department of Health (Australia)|Australian Government's Department of Health]] published the results of a review of alternative therapies that sought to determine if any were suitable for being covered by [[health insurance]]; aromatherapy was one of 17 therapies evaluated for which no clear evidence of effectiveness was found.&lt;ref name="aus17"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/0E9129B3574FCA53CA257BF0001ACD11/$File/Natural%20Therapies%20Overview%20Report%20Final%20with%20copyright%2011%20March.pdf |publisher=Australian Government &amp;ndash; Department of Health |format=PDF |author=Baggoley C |title=Review of the Australian Government Rebate on Natural Therapies for Private Health Insurance |year=2015 |laysummary=https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/australian-review-finds-no-benefit-to-17-natural-therapies |lay-source=Gavura, S.

Studies were found to be of low quality, meaning more well-designed, large scale randomized controlled trials are needed before clear conclusions can be drawn as to the effectiveness of aromatherapy.

==Safety concerns==
{{further|Alternative medicine#Criticism, legitimacy and effects}}
&lt;!-- please consider updating the essential oil article's section on safety/danger when you update this. --&gt;

Aromatherapy carries a risk of a number of [[adverse effects]] and this consideration, combined with the lack of evidence of its therapeutic benefit, makes the practice of questionable worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Posadzki P, Alotaibi A, Ernst E |title=Adverse effects of aromatherapy: a systematic review of case reports and case series |journal=Int J Risk Saf Med |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=147–61 |date=January 2012  |pmid=22936057 |doi=10.3233/JRS-2012-0568 |type=Systematic review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because essential oils are highly concentrated they can irritate the skin when used in undiluted form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=J |last1=Grassman |first2=E F |last2=Elstner |chapter=Essential Oils |title=Encyclopedia of Food Sciences and Nutrition |edition=2nd |editor1-first=Benjamin |editor1-last=Caballero |editor2-first=Luiz C |editor2-last=Trugo |editor3-first=Paul M |editor3-last=Finglas |publisher=Academic Press |year=1973 |isbn=0-12-227055-X}}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, they are normally diluted with a carrier oil for topical application, such as [[jojoba oil]], [[olive oil]], or [[coconut oil]].

The Australian Tea Tree Association, a group that promotes the interests of Australian tea tree oil producers, exporters and manufacturers issued a letter that questioned the study and called on the ''New England Journal of Medicine'' for a retraction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teatree.org.au/read_more.php?id=2  'ATTIA refutes gynecomastia link'],  Article Date: 21 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''New England Journal of Medicine'' has so far not replied and has not retracted the study.

As with any [[Biological activity|bioactive]] substance, an essential oil that may be safe for the general public could still pose hazards for pregnant and lactating women.

While some advocate the ingestion of essential oils for therapeutic purposes, licensed aromatherapy professionals do not recommend self-prescription due to the highly toxic nature of some essential oils. Some very common oils like [[eucalyptus]] are extremely toxic when taken internally. Doses as low as one teaspoon have been reported to cause clinically significant symptoms and severe poisoning can occur after ingestion of 4 to 5 ml.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/pims/pharm/pim031.htm#SectionTitle:7.2%20%20Toxicity|title=Eucalyptus oil|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A few reported cases of toxic reactions like [[liver]] damage and seizures have occurred after ingestion of sage, hyssop, thuja, and cedar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3109/15563658108990357 |title=Toxicity of Some Essential Plant Oils.

Oils both ingested and applied to the skin can potentially have negative interactions with conventional medicine. For example, the topical use of [[methyl salicylate]]-heavy oils like [[sweet birch]] and [[wintergreen]] may cause bleeding in users taking the [[anticoagulant]] [[warfarin]].

Adulterated oils may also pose problems depending on the type of substance used.

The practice, a form of [[homeopathy]],&lt;ref name="powerhouse"&gt;{{cite web |title= Lebenswecker, an instrument used in homeopathic medicine, 1865-1875 |url= http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=55398#ixzz1T5NDajNh |work= [[Powerhouse Museum]] Collection |location= [[Sydney]] |accessdate=2011-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is named for its founder [[Carl Baunscheidt]] (1809&amp;ndash;1873), a German mechanic and inventor.

[[File:Carl Baunscheidt.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Carl Baunscheidt]]
The legitimacy of baunscheidtism as an effective medical practice was questioned by at least 1880, when a [[Melbourne]] practitioner named Samuel Fischer lost a [[lawsuit]] he brought against a patient who failed to pay him, based on the objection that Fischer (a bootmaker) was not a qualified medical practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Sandhurst, from our own correspondent. |work= The Argus |date= March 16, 1880 |url= http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5978504 |accessdate= 2011-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lebenswecker==
[[File:MBq Lebenswecker.jpg|thumb|right|A lebenswecker.]]
The lebenswecker ("life awakener") or "artificial leech" was a medical device invented by Baunscheidt to pierce the skin with many fine needles. Billed as being able to cure myriad illnesses, the lebenswecker was used on skin treated with [[irritation|toxic oil]]. The resulting inflammation was alleged to draw the body's attention away from the patient's illness, thus effecting a cure.&lt;ref name="phisick"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.phisick.com/a8qlebenswecker2.htm |work= Phisick Medical Antiques |title= Original Baunscheidt Lebenswecker by Droz |last= Slater |first= Laurie |accessdate= 2011-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The diseases that could allegedly be cured with the lebenswecker included [[pertussis|whooping cough]], [[baldness]], toothaches, and [[mental disorder]]s. The device's popularity was great enough to support a market for "counterfeit" versions of the lebenswecker that were produced by Baunscheidt.

[[File:Spectrophotometer.jpg|thumb|right|DU Spectrophotometer, National Technical Laboratories, 1947]]

The '''DU spectrophotometer''' or '''Beckman DU''', introduced in 1941, was the first commercially viable [[scientific instrument]] for measuring the amount of [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet light]] absorbed by a substance. This model of [[spectrophotometer]] enabled scientists to easily examine and identify a given substance based on its [[absorption spectrum]], the pattern of light absorbed at different wavelengths. [[Arnold Orville Beckman|Arnold O. Beckman]]'s [[National Technical Laboratories]] (later Beckman Instruments) developed three in-house prototype models (A, B, C) and one limited distribution model (D) before moving to full commercial production with the DU. Approximately 30,000 DU spectrophotometers were manufactured and sold between 1941 and 1976.

Sometimes referred to as a UV–Vis spectrophotometer because it measured both the [[ultraviolet]] (UV) and [[Visible spectrum|visible]] spectra, the DU spectrophotometer is credited as being a truly revolutionary technology. It yielded more accurate results than previous methods for determining the [[chemical composition]] of a complex substance, and substantially reduced the time needed for an accurate analysis from weeks or hours to minutes. The Beckman DU was essential to several critical secret research projects during [[World War II]], including the development of [[penicillin]] and [[synthetic rubber]].

==Background==
Before the development of the DU spectrophotometer, analysis of a test sample to determine its components was a long, costly, and often inaccurate process. A classical [[Wet chemistry|wet laboratory]] contained a wide variety of complicated apparatus.&lt;ref name="Dulski"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dulski|first1=Thomas R.|title=A manual for the chemical analysis of metals|date=1996|publisher=ASTM|location=West Conshohocken, PA|isbn=978-0-8031-2066-2|chapter=The Wet Lab|pages=11–14|edition=Online-Ausg.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ViOMjoLKB1gC&amp;pg=PA11|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Test samples were run through a series of awkward and time-consuming [[Qualitative research|qualitative processes]] to separate out and identify their components. Determining [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] concentrations of those components in the sample involved further steps. Processes could involve techniques for [[chemical reactions]], [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitations]], [[filtration]]s and [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolutions]].&lt;ref name="hundred"&gt;{{cite book

Spectroscopic methods for observing the [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]] in the [[visible spectrum]] were known as early as the 1860s.&lt;ref name="Morris"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=Peter J. T.|last2=Travis|first2=Anthony S.|chapter=The role of physical instrumentation in structural organic chemistry in the twentieth century|editor-last1=Morris|editor-first1=Peter J.

Scientists had observed that light traveling through a [[Optical medium|medium]] would be absorbed at different wavelengths, depending on the matter-composition of the medium involved. A white light source would emit light at multiple wavelengths over a range of frequencies. A prism could be used to separate a light source into specific wavelengths. Shining the light through a sample of a material would cause some wavelengths of light to be absorbed, while others would be unaffected and continue to be transmitted. Wavelengths in the resulting [[absorption spectrum]] would differ depending upon the [[atom]]ic and [[molecule|molecular]] composition if the material involved.&lt;ref name="MMSU"&gt;{{cite web|title=Experiment 10|url=http://www.pa.msu.edu/courses/2013spring/PHY252/Lab10.pdf|website=MMSU Physics and Astronomy Department|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Daniel C.|last2=Bertolucci|first2=Michael D.|title=Symmetry and spectroscopy : an introduction to vibrational and electronic spectroscopy|date=1989|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|isbn=978-0-486-66144-5|edition=Reprint|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I3W6oSaRlMsC&amp;pg=PA66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hollas|first1=J. Michael|title=Modern spectroscopy|date=2004|publisher=J. Wiley|location=Chichester|isbn=978-0-470-84416-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spectroscopic methods were predominantly used by [[physicists]] and [[astrophysicists]]. Spectroscopic techniques were rarely taught in chemistry classes and were unfamiliar to most practicing chemists. Beginning around 1904, Frank Twyman of the London instrument making firm Adam Hilger, Ltd. tried to develop spectroscopic instruments for chemists, but his customer base was consistently made up of physicists rather than chemists.
&lt;ref name="Bigg"/&gt;{{rp|113–118}} By the 1930s he had developed a [[niche market]] in [[metallurgy]], where his instruments were well adapted to the types of problems that chemists were solving.&lt;ref name="Bigg"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bigg|first1=Charlotte|chapter=Adam Hilger, Ltd and the Development of Spectrochemical Analysis|editor-last1=Morris|editor-first1=Peter J. T.|title=From classical to modern chemistry : the instrumental revolution|date=2002|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry |location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-85404-479-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AAf8sk_v2SEC&amp;pg=PA113|pages=111–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|124}}

By the 1940s, both academic and industrial chemists were becoming increasingly interested in problems involving the composition and detection of [[Biomolecule|biological molecules]]. Biological molecules, including [[proteins]] and [[nucleic acids]], absorb light energy in both the [[ultraviolet]] and [[Visible spectrum|visible]] range.&lt;ref name=Smutzer/&gt; The spectrum of visible light was not broad enough to enable scientists to examine substances such as [[vitamin A]].&lt;ref name="Rosenfeld"/&gt; Accurate characterization of complex samples, particularly of biological materials, would require the accurate reading of absorption frequencies in the ultraviolet and [[infrared]] (IR) sections of the spectrum in addition to visible light. Existing instruments such as the [[Central Scientific Company|Cenco]] "Spectrophotelometer" and the Coleman Model DM Spectrophotometer could not be effectively used to examine wavelengths in the ultraviolet range.&lt;ref name="Rosenfeld"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Simoni/&gt;

The array of equipment needed to measure light energy reaching beyond the visible spectrum towards the ultraviolet could cost a laboratory as much as $3,000, a huge amount in 1940.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|149}} Repeated readings of a sample were taken to produce [[photographic plates]] showing the absorption spectrum of a material at different wavelengths. An experienced human could compare these to the known images to identify a match. Then information from the plates had to be combined to create a graph showing the spectrum as a whole. Ultimately, the accuracy of such approaches was dependent on accurate, consistent development of the photographic plates, and on human [[visual acuity]] and practice in reading the wavelengths.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|150–151}}

==Development==
The DU was developed at National Technical Laboratories (later [[Beckman Instruments]]) under the direction of [[Arnold Orville Beckman]], an American chemist and inventor.&lt;ref name="Gallwas"&gt;{{cite journal

Coleman Instruments had recently coupled a [[pH meter]] with an optical [[phototube]] unit to examine the visual spectrum (the Coleman Model DM).&lt;ref name=Smutzer/&gt; Beckman had already developed a successful pH meter for measuring acidity of solutions, his company's breakthrough product. Seeing the potential to build upon their existing expertise, Beckman made it a goal to create an easy-to-use integrated instrument which would both register and report specific wavelengths extending into the ultraviolet range. Rather than depending on development of photographic plates, or a human observer's visual ability to detect wavelengths in the absorption spectrum, phototubes would be used to register and report the specific wavelengths that were detected. This had the potential to increase the instrument's accuracy and reliability as well as its speed and ease of use.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|149–151}}

=== Model A (prototype) ===
The first prototype Beckman spectrophotometer, the Model A, was created at National Technologies Laboratories in 1940. It used a [[tungsten]] light source with a glass [[Fery prism]] as a [[monochromator]].&lt;ref name="Belser"&gt;{{cite web

Tungsten lamps were useful in the visible light range but gave poor coverage in the ultraviolet range. However, they had the advantage of being readily available because they were used as automobile [[headlamps]].&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|17}} An external amplifier from the Beckman pH meter and a [[vacuum tube]] photocell were used to detect wavelengths.&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|16}}

===Model B (prototype) ===
[[File:Quartz-tcq01a.jpg|thumb|right|Optical quality quartz crystals]]
It was quickly realized that a glass [[dispersive prism]] was not suitable for use in the ultraviolet spectrum.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|153}}&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|16}} Glass absorbed electromagnetic radiation below 400 [[Nanometre|millimicrons]] rather than dispersing it.&lt;ref name="Bisen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bisen|first1=Prakash S.|last2=Sharma|first2=Anjana|title=Introduction to instrumentation in life sciences|date=2013|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, FL|isbn=978-1-4665-1240-5|page=124|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T1HOBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA124|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Model B, a [[quartz]] prism was substituted for the earlier glass.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|153}}&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|16}}

A tangent bar mechanism was used to adjust the monochromator. The mechanism was highly sensitive and required a skilled operator.&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|16}} Only two Model B prototypes were made. One was sold: in February 1941, to the [[University of California]] Chemistry department in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|153}}

The Model B prototype should be distinguished from a later production model of spectrophotometer that was also referred to as the Model "B". The production Model "B" was introduced in 1949 as a less-expensive, simple-to-use alternative to the Beckman DU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TheSpectrophotometers That Would Not Die|url=http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/599/2/Spectrophotometers.pdf|website=Caltech|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It used a glass Fery prism as a chromator and operated in a narrower range, roughly from 320 millimicrons to 950 millimicrons, and 5 to 20 [[Angstrom|Å]].&lt;ref name="Glover"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Glover|first1=J.|editor-last1=Paech|editor-first1=K.|editor-last2=Tracey|editor-first2=M.

===Model C (prototype) ===
Three Model C instruments were then built, improving the instrument's wavelength resolution. The Model B's rotary cell compartment was replaced with a linear sample chamber. The tangent bar mechanism was replaced by a scroll drive mechanism,&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|16}} which could be more precisely controlled to reset the quartz prism and select the desired wavelength.&lt;ref name="Smutzer"/&gt; With this new mechanism, results could be more easily and reliably obtained, without requiring a highly skilled operator. This set the pattern for all of Beckman's later quartz prism instruments.&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|16}} Although only three Model B prototypes were built, all were sold, one to [[Caltech]] and the other two to companies in the food industry.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|153}}

===Model D (limited production) ===
[[File:Cary+Beckman 1941 original of Fig 6 Quartz photoelectric spectrophotometer 2012-002 b17f20 001 crop.jpg | thumb|right | Quartz photoelectric spectrophotometer, Cary &amp; Beckman, 1941&lt;ref name="Cary"/&gt;{{rp|687}}]]

The A, B, and C prototype models all coupled an external Beckman pH meter to the optical component to obtain readouts. In developing the Model D, Beckman took the [[direct-coupled amplifier]] circuit from the pH meter and combined the optical and electronic components in a single housing, making it more economical.&lt;ref name="Smutzer"/&gt;

Moving from a prototype to production of the Model D involved challenges. 
Beckman originally approached [[Bausch and Lomb]] about making quartz prisms for the spectrophotometer. When they turned down the opportunity, National Technical Laboratories designed its own optical system, including both a control mechanism and a quartz prism. Large, high optical quality quartz suitable for creating prisms was difficult to obtain. It came from Brazil, and was in demand for wartime [[Crystal oscillator|radio oscillators]]. Beckman had to obtain a wartime priority listing for the spectrophotometer to get access to suitable quartz supplies.&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|17}}

Beckman had previously attempted to find a source of reliable [[Deuterium arc lamp|hydrogen lamps]], seeking better sensitivity to wavelengths in the ultraviolet range than was possible with tungsten. As described in July 1941, the Beckman spectrophotomter could use a "hot cathode hydrogen discharge tube" or a tungsten light source interchangeably.&lt;ref name="Cary"/&gt;{{rp|684–685}} However, Beckman was still unsatisfied with the available hydrogen lamps. National Technical Laboratories designed its own hydrogen lamp, an [[anode]] enclosed in a thin blown-glass window.&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|17}} By December 1941, the in-house design was being used in production of the Model D.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|154–155}}

The instrument's design also required a more sensitive phototube than was commercially available at that time. Beckman was able to obtain small batches of an experimental phototube from [[RCA]] for the first Model D instruments.&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|17}}

The Model D spectrophotometer, using the experimental RCA phototube, was shown at [[MIT]]'s Summer Conference on Spectroscopy in July 1941. The paper that Cary and Beckman presented there was published in the ''Journal of the Optical Society of America''. In it, Cary and Beckman compared designs for a modified [[Collimated light|self-collimating]] quartz Fery prism, a mirror-collimated quartz [[Littrow prism]], and various gratings.&lt;ref name="Cary"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cary|first1=H. H.|last2=Beckman|first2=Arnold O.|title=A Quartz Photoelectric Spectrophotometer|journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America|date=1941|volume=31|issue=11|pages=682–689 |doi=10.1364/JOSA.31.000682|url=https://www.osapublishing.org/josa/abstract.cfm?uri=josa-31-11-682}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|683}} The Littrow prism was a half-prism, which had a mirrored face.&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt;{{rp|31–34}} Use of a tungsten light source with the [[quartz]] Littrow prism as a monochromator was reported to minimize light scattering within the instrument.&lt;ref name="Cary"/&gt;{{rp|686}}

The Model D was the first model to enter actual production. A small number of Model D instruments were sold, beginning in July 1941, before it was superseded by the DU.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|153–155}}&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|17–18}}

===Model DU===
[[File:Cary+Beckman 1941 original of Fig 7 disassembled Quartz photoelectric spectrophotometer 2012-002 b17f20 003 crop.jpg | thumb|right | Disassembled absorption cell and photo-tube compartment, Cary &amp; Beckman, 1941&lt;ref name="Cary"/&gt;{{rp|687}}]]

When RCA could not meet Beckman's demand for experimental phototubes, National Technical Laboratories again had to design its own components in-house.&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|18}} They developed a pair of phototubes, sensitive to the red and blue areas of the spectrum, capable of amplifying the signals they received.&lt;ref name="Gardiner"/&gt;{{rp|230}} With the incorporation of Beckman's UV-sensitive phototubes, the Model D became the Model DU UV–Vis spectrophotometer.&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|18}} Its designation as a "UV–Vis" spectrophotometer indicates its ability to measure light in both the visible and ultraviolet spectra.&lt;ref name=Buie/&gt;

The DU was the first commercially viable scientific instrument for measuring the amount of ultraviolet light absorbed by a substance.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|148}} &lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt;{{rp|10}} As he had done with the pH meter, Beckman had replaced an array of complicated equipment with a single, easy-to-use instrument. One of the first fully integrated instruments&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|11}} or "[[black box]]es" used in modern chemical laboratories,&lt;ref name="NIH"&gt;{{cite web|title=Visible Proofs: Forensic Views of the Body|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/visibleproofs/galleries/technologies/spectral_image_5.html|website=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; it sold for $723 in 1941.&lt;ref name=Simoni/&gt;

It is generally assumed that the "DU" in the name was a combination of "D" for the Model D on which it was based, and "U" for the ultraviolet spectrum. However, it has been suggested that "DU" may also reference Beckman's fraternity at the University of Illinois, [[Delta Upsilon Fraternity House (Champaign, Illinois)|Delta Upsilon]], whose members were called "DU"s.&lt;ref name="ISL"&gt;{{cite web|title=Beckman Model DU Quartz Spectrophotometer|url=http://www.isl.uiuc.edu/Arnold_inventions/Spectrophotometer/Spectrophotometer.html|website=Illinois Simulator Laboratory|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A publication in the scholarly literature compared the optical quality of the DU to the [[Cary 14 Spectrophotometer]], another leading UV–Vis spectrophotometer of the time.&lt;ref name="JOS1953"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brode|first1=Wallace R.|last2=Gould|first2=John H.|last3=Whitney|first3=James E.|last4=Wyman|first4=George M.|title=A Comparative Survey of Spectrophotometers in the 210–760 mμ Region|journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America|date=October 1953|volume=43|issue=10|pages=862–865|bibcode=1953JOSA...43..862B|doi=10.1364/JOSA.43.000862}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;
From 1941 until 1976, when it was discontinued, the Model DU spectrophotometer was built upon what was essentially the same design.&lt;ref name=Simoni/&gt; It was a single beam instrument.&lt;ref name=Manning/&gt;{{rp|11}}&lt;ref name="Trace"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dulski|first1=Thomas R.|title=Trace elemental analysis of metals : methods and techniques|date=1999|publisher=Marcel Dekker|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8247-1985-2|page=195|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vk7lTgTMEIEC&amp;pg=PA195|accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The DU spectrophotometers used a quartz prism to separate light from a lamp into its absorption spectrum and a phototube to electrically measure the light energy across the spectrum. This allowed the user to plot the light absorption spectrum of a substance to obtain a standardized "fingerprint" characteristic of a compound.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|151}} &lt;ref name="Jarnutowski"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jarnutowski|first1=R.|last2=Ferraro|first2=J.

{{quote|"Light from the tungsten lamp is focused by the condensing mirror and directed in a beam to the diagonal slit entrance mirror. The entrance mirror deflects the light through the entrance slit and into the monochromator to the collimating mirror. Light falling on the collimating mirror is rendered parallel and reflected to the quartz prism where it undergoes refraction. The back surface of the prism is aluminized so that light refracted at the first surface is reflected back through the prism, undergoing further refraction as it emerges from the prism. The desired wavelength of light is selected by rotating the Wavelength Selector which adjusts the position of the prism. The spectrum is directed back to the collimating mirror which centers the chosen wavelength on the exit slit and sample. Light passing through the sample strikes the phototube, causing a current gain. The current gain is amplified and registered on the null meter." Model DU Optical System&lt;ref name="Manual1954"/&gt;{{rp|3}} }}

Although the default light source for the instrument was tungsten, a hydrogen or [[Mercury-vapor lamp|mercury lamp]] could be substituted depending on the optimal range of measurement for which the instrument was to be used.&lt;ref name="Manual1954"&gt;{{cite book|title=Beckman Instruments Instruction Manual : The Beckman Model DU Spectrophotometer and Accessories|date=1954|publisher=Beckman Instruments, Inc.|location=Fullerton, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp|3}} The tungsten lamp was suitable for transmittance of wavelengths between 320 and 1000 millimicrons; the hydrogen lamp for 220 to 320 millimicrons, and the mercury lamp for checking the calibration of the spectrophotometer.&lt;ref name="Manual1954"/&gt;{{rp|6}}

As advertised in the 1941 News Edition of the American Chemical Society, the Beckman Spectrophotometer used an [[Autocollimation|autocollimating]] quartz crystal prism for a monochromator, capable of covering a range from the ultraviolet (200 millimicrons) to the infrared (2000 millimicrons), with a nominal bandwidth of 2 millimicrons or less for most of its spectral range. The slit mechanism was continuously adjustable from .01 to 2.0&amp;nbsp;mm and claimed to have less than 1/10% of stray light over most of the spectral range. It featured an easy-to-read wavelength scale, simultaneously reporting % Transmission and Density information.&lt;ref name="Advertisement"/&gt;

The sample holder held up to 4 cells.&lt;ref name="Manual1954"/&gt;{{rp|3}}&lt;ref name="Advertisement"/&gt; Cells could be moved into the light path via an external control, allowing the user to take multiple readings without opening the cell compartment.&lt;ref name="Manual1954"/&gt;{{rp|3}} As described in the DU's manual, absorbance measurements of a sample were made in comparison to a [[Blank (solution)|blank]], or [[Standard solution|standard]], "a solution identical in composition with the sample except that the absorbing material being measured is absent."&lt;ref name="Manual1954"/&gt;{{rp|24}} The standard could be a cell filled with a [[solvent]] such as [[distilled water]]&lt;ref name="Manual1954"/&gt;{{rp|24}} or a prepared solvent of a known concentration.&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robinson|first1=James W.|title=Atomic spectroscopy|date=1996|publisher=Dekker|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8247-9742-3|pages=30–33|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNqp0RO7DXcC&amp;pg=PA30|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30–31}} At each wavelength two measurements are made: with the sample and with the standard in the light beam. This enables the ratio, [[transmittance]], to be obtained. For quantitative measurements transmittance is converted to [[absorbance]] which is proportional to the solute concentration according to [[Beer's law]]. This makes possible the quantitative determination of the amount of a substance in solution.&lt;ref name="Drees"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Bishop|editor-first1=Michael L.|editor-last2=Fody|editor-first2=Edward P. | editor-first3=Larry E. |editor-last3=Schoeff|last2=Wu|first2=Alan H.

The user could also switch between phototubes without removing the sample holder. A 1941 advertisement indicates that three types of phototubes were available, with maximum sensitivity to red, blue and ultraviolet light ranges.&lt;ref name="Advertisement"&gt;{{cite news|title=Announcing an Important New Beckman Development THE BECKMAN Spectrophotometer|work=News Edition of the American Chemical Society|page=NA|agency=American Chemical Society|date=September 25, 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1954 DU spectrophotometer differs in that it claims to be useful from 200 to 1000 millimicrons,&lt;ref name="Manual1954"/&gt;{{rp|2}} and does not mention the ultraviolet phototube.&lt;ref name="Manual1954"/&gt;{{rp|3}} The wavelength selector, however, still ranged from 200 to 2000 millimicrons.&lt;ref name="Manual1954"/&gt;{{rp|4}} and an "Ultraviolet accessory set" was available.&lt;ref name="Manual1954"/&gt;{{rp|25}} This shift away from using the DU for infrared measurement is understandable, since by 1954 Beckman Instruments was marketing a separate infrared spectrophotometer. Beckman developed the IR-1 infrared spectrophotometer during World War II, and redesigned it as the IR-4 between 1953 and 1956.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|165}}&lt;ref name="Pillsbury"/&gt;{{rp|6–7}}

==Impact==

Credited with having "brought about a breakthrough in optical spectroscopy",&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt;{{rp|10}} the Beckman DU has been identified as "an indispensable tool for chemistry"&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|207}} and "the [[Model T]] of laboratory instruments".&lt;ref name=Simoni/&gt; Approximately 30,000 DU spectrophotometers were manufactured and sold between 1941 and 1976.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schmidt|first1=Werner|title=Optical spectroscopy in chemistry and life sciences|date=2005|publisher=Wiley-VCH|location=Weinheim|isbn=3-527-29911-4|chapter=Introduction to Optical Spectroscopy|pages=1–11|url=http://www.wiley-vch.de/books/sample/3527299114_c01.pdf|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}&lt;ref name="Browne"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Browne|first1=Malcolm W.|title=After Decades, Inventor's Work Is Still Felt in the Laboratory|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/10/science/after-decades-inventor-s-work-is-still-felt-in-the-laboratory.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=9 March 2016|work=The New York Times|date=November 10, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DU enabled researchers to perform easier analysis of substances by quickly taking measurements at more than one wavelength to produce an absorption spectrum describing the complete substance. For example, the standard method of analysis of the [[vitamin A]] content of [[shark liver oil]], before the introduction of the DU spectrophotometer, involved feeding the oil to rats for 21 days, then cutting off the rats' tails and examining their bone structure. With the DU's UV technology, vitamin A content of shark liver oil could be determined directly in a matter of minutes.&lt;ref name="Pillsbury"/&gt;{{rp|6}}

The Scripps Research Institute and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology credit the DU with improving both accuracy and speed of chemical analysis. MIT states: "This device forever simplified and streamlined chemical analysis, by allowing researchers to perform a 99.9% accurate quantitative measurement of a substance within minutes, as opposed to the weeks required previously for results of only 25% accuracy."&lt;ref name="Scripps"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MIT"/&gt;

===Vitamins===
Development of the spectrophotometer had direct relevance to World War II and the American war effort. The role of vitamins in health was of significant concern, as scientists wanted to identify [[Vitamin A]]-rich foods to keep soldiers healthy. Previous methods of assessing Vitamin A levels involved feeding rats a food for several weeks and then performing a biopsy to estimate ingested Vitamin A levels. In contrast, examining a food sample with a DU spectrophotometer yielded better results in a matter of minutes.&lt;ref name=LabNews&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mark|first=Andrew|title=Leading the way in chemical instrumentation|journal=Laboratory News|date=September 21, 2007|url=http://www.labnews.co.uk/features/leading-the-way-in-chemical-instrumentation/|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DU spectrophotometer could be used to study both vitamin A and its precursor [[carotenoids]],&lt;ref name="Avampato"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Avampato|first1=J.E.|last2=Eaton|first2=H.D.|title=Comparison of Methods for the Estimation of Vitamin A in Calf Plasma|journal=Journal of Dairy Science|date=August 1953|volume=36|issue=8|pages=783–793|doi=10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(53)91563-X|url=http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022-0302(53)91563-X/abstract|accessdate=10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rapidly became the preferred method of spectrophotometric analysis.&lt;ref name="Rosenfeld"&gt;{{cite journal

===Enzyme assays and DNA research===
[[Gerty Cori]] and her husband [[Carl Ferdinand Cori]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1947 in recognition of their work on [[enzymes]]. They made several discoveries critical to understanding [[carbohydrate metabolism]], including the isolation and discovery of the [[Cori ester]], [[glucose 1-phosphate]], and the understanding of the [[Cori cycle]]. They determined that the enzyme [[phosphorylase]] catalyzes formation of glucose 1-phosphate, which is the beginning and ending step in the conversions of [[glycogen]] into [[glucose]] and [[blood glucose]] to glycogen. Gerty Cori was also the first to show that a defect in an enzyme can be the cause of a human genetic disease.&lt;ref name=Smeltzer&gt;{{cite book|last=Smeltzer|first=Ronald K.|title=Extraordinary Women in Science &amp; Medicine: Four Centuries of Achievement|year=2013|publisher=The Grolier Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Beckman DU spectrophotometer was used in the Cori laboratory to calculate enzyme concentrations, including phosphorylase.&lt;ref name="Cori"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cori|first1=Carl F.|last2=Illingworth|first2=Barbara|title=The prosthetic group of phosphorylase|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=July 15, 1957|volume=43|issue=7|pages=547–552|pmc=528497|bibcode = 1957PNAS...43..547C |doi = 10.1073/pnas.43.7.547|pmid=16590054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another researcher who spent six months in 1947 at the Cori laboratory, "the most vibrant place in biochemistry" at that time, was [[Arthur Kornberg]].&lt;ref name="Teachers"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kornberg|first1=Arthur|title=Remembering Our Teachers|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|date=January 5, 2001|volume=276|pages=3–11|url=http://www.jbc.org/content/276/1/3|accessdate=17 March 2016|pmid=11134064}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kornberg was already familiar with the DU spectrophotometer, which he had used at [[Severo Ochoa]]'s laboratory at [[New York University]]. The "new and scarce" Beckman DU, loaned to Ochoa by the [[American Philosophical Society]], was highly prized and in constant use. Kornberg used it to purify [[aconitase]], an enzyme in the [[citric acid cycle]].&lt;ref name="Teachers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="exton"/&gt;

Kornberg and Bernard L. Horecker used the Beckman DU spectrophotometer for enzyme assays measuring [[NADH]] and [[NADPH]].

This work became one of the most cited papers in biochemistry.&lt;ref name="exton"/&gt;{{rp|115}} Kornberg went on to study nucleotides in DNA synthesis, isolating the first DNA polymerizing enzyme ([[DNA polymerase I]]) in 1956 and receiving the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] with Severo Ochoa in 1959.&lt;ref name="Kresge"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kresge|first1=Nicole|last2=Simoni|first2=Robert D.|last3=Hill|first3=Robert L.|title=Arthur Kornberg's Discovery of DNA Polymerase I|journal=J.

He further demonstrated that the relative amounts of guanine, cytosine, adenine and thymine varied between species. In 1952, Chargaff met [[Francis Crick]] and [[James D. Watson]], discussing his findings with them. Watson and Crick built upon his ideas in their determination of the structure of DNA.&lt;ref name="Board"/&gt;

==Later models==
[[File:Beckman DK1 Spectrophotometer 2002.003.004b.tif|thumb|right| Beckman Model DK1 Ultraviolet Spectrophotometer]]

The Beckman team eventually developed additional models, as well as a number of accessories or attachments which could be used to modify the DU for different types of work. One of the first accessories was a flame attachment with a more powerful photo multiplier to enable the user to examine flames such as [[potassium]], [[sodium]] and [[cesium]] (1947).&lt;ref name=Manning/&gt;{{rp|11}}&lt;ref name="Gardiner"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardiner|first1=Kenneth|editor-last=Berl|editor-first=Walter G.|title=Physical Methods in Chemical Analysis|date=1956|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4832-5563-7|chapter=Flame photometry|pages=219–290|edition=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FSsXBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA230|accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|230}}

In the 1950s, Beckman Instruments developed the DR and the DK, both of which were double-beam ultraviolet spectrophotometers. The DK was named for [[Wilbur I. Kaye]], who developed it by modifying the DU to expand its range into the near-infrared.&lt;ref name=Manning/&gt; He did the initial work while at Tennessee [[Eastman Kodak]], and later was hired by Beckman Instruments.&lt;ref name=Kaye&gt;{{cite book|first1= Arnold |last1=Thackray |last2= Gallwas|first2= Gerald E.|title=Wilbur I.

The DK-1 used a non-linear scroll, and the DK-2 used a linear scroll to automatically record the spectra.&lt;ref name=Kaye/&gt;{{rp|21}}

The DR incorporated a "robot operator" which would reset the knobs on the DU to complete a sequence of measurements at different wavelengths, just like a human operator would to generate results for a full spectrum. It used a linear shuttle with four positions, and a superstructure to change the knobs. It had a moving chart recorder to plot results, with red, green and black dots.&lt;ref name=Manning/&gt; The price of recording spectrophotometers was substantially higher than non-recording machines.&lt;ref name="Krige"&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9606">'''Daffy's Elixir''' (also sometimes known as '''Daffey's Elixir''' or '''Daffye's Elixir''') is a name that has been used by several [[patent medicines]] over the years. It was originally designed for diseases of the stomach, but was later marketed as a universal cure. It remained a popular remedy in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and later the [[United States of America]] throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

[[Image:Three early medicine bottles.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Three empty bottle medicine bottles, the centre on embossed with the words 'Dicey and Co. True Daffy's Elixir|An empty bottle of True Daffy's Elixir (centre) Dicey and Co.]]

== Origins ==

Daffy's Elixir was one of the most popular and frequently advertised [[patent medicines]] in Britain during the 18th century. It is reputed to have been invented by clergyman [[Thomas Daffy]] rector of [[Redmile]], [[Leicestershire]], in 1647. He named it '''elixir salutis''' (lit. ''elixir of health'') and promoted as a generic [[cure-all]].

[[Image:Daffy's elixir.jpg|thumb|left|300px|alt=A recipe for Daffey's Elixir|A home recipe for the True Daffy's Elixir, from William Augustus Henderson ''Modern domestic cookery and useful receipt book'', New York, 1829.]]

== Ingredients ==

An early recipe for "True Daffy" from 1700 lists the following ingredients: [[aniseed]], [[brandy]], [[cochineal]], [[elecampane]], [[fennel seed]], [[jalap]], [[manna]], [[parsley seed]], [[raisin]], [[rhubarb]], [[saffron]], [[Senna (plant)|senna]] and [[spanish liquorice]]. Chemical analysis has shown this to be a [[laxative]] made mostly from alcohol. Other recipes include [[Guaiacum|Guiuacum]] wood chips, [[caraway]], [[Potassium carbonate|Salt of Tartar]], and [[scammony]].

== Uses ==

According to an early nineteenth century advertisement it was used for the following ailments: The Stone in Babies and Children; [[Convulsion]] [[Seizure|fits]]; [[Tuberculosis|Consumption]] and Bad [[Digestion|Digestives]]; [[Fever|Agues]]; [[Hemorrhoid|Piles]]; Surfeits; Fits of the Mother and [[Vapours (disease)|Vapours]] from the [[Spleen]]; [[Chlorosis (medicine)|Green Sickness]]; Children's Distempers, whether the [[Cestoda|Worms]], [[Rickets]], [[Urolithiasis|Stones]], Convulsions, [[Baby colic|Gripes]], [[Scrofula|King's Evil]], Joint Evil or any other disorder proceeding from [[Flatulence|Wind]] or Crudities; [[Gout]] and [[Rheumatism]]; [[Kidney stone|Stone or Gravel]] in the Kidnies; [[Colic|Cholic and Griping of the Bowels]]; the [[Tuberculosis|Phthisic]] (both as cure and preventative provided always that the patient be moderate in drinking, have a care to prevent taking cold and keep a good diet; [[Edema|Dropsy]] and [[Scurvy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Fleming | first = Lindsay | title = Daffy's Elixir | journal = Notes and Queries  | volume =  | issue =  | pages = 238–9 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = | date = June 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; The frequent use of the medicine to treat Colic, gripes or fret in [[horse]]s was deplored in early [[veterinary medicine|veterinary]] manuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = White | first = James |title = Treatise on veterinary medicine | publisher = Longman | year = 1820 | location = London | page = 121 | volume=2 | url = | oclc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subsequent history ==

After Daffy's death in 1680 the recipe was left to his daughter Catherine, and his kinsmen Anthony and Daniel who were [[apothecary|apothecaries]] in [[Nottingham]]. Anthony Daffy moved to London in the 1690s and began to exploit the product issuing pamphlets such as ''Directions for taking elixir salutis or, the famous purging cordial, known by the name of Daffy's elixir salutis'' [London], [1690?]. His widow Elleanor Daffy continued from about 1693 and (their daughter?) Katharine from about 1707. During the early 18th century the product was advertised widely in the emerging national and local [[newspaper]]s. The success attracted several counterfeit copies, using inferior alcohol rather than brandy.

The medicine was later produced by William and Cluer Dicey &amp; Co. of Bow Church yard c.1775 who claimed the sole rights of manufacture of the True Daffy's Elixir, although the recipe was not subject to any patent. Proprietorship was also then claimed by Peter Swinton of Salisbury Court and his son Anthony Daffy Swinton who may have been descended from the inventor.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, (1953), p.238.&lt;/ref&gt; Dicey and Co. and their successors marketed it in the [[United States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Coxe | first = John Redman | title = The American dispensatory | publisher = Carey and Lea | year = 1831 | location = Philadelphia  | page = 780  | url =  | doi =  | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It then passed to Dicey and Sutton, and later to Messrs W. Sutton &amp; Co. of [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]] [[Middlesex]] who continuing to market it throughout the nineteenth century. The use of Daffy's elixir is referred to in [[Anthony Trollope]]'s novel [[Barchester Towers]], 1857.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Trollope | first = Anthony | title = Barchester Towers | publisher = Folio Society | year = 1977 | location = London | page = 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daffy's elixir is also mentioned on several occasions in [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s novel [[Mason &amp; Dixon]], particularly by [[Jeremiah Dixon]], who attempts to procure large quantities before beginning his surveying trip with [[Charles Mason]].  Dixon is warned by [[Benjamin Franklin]], however, that imported Daffy's Elixir is extremely expensive, and he would be better off ordering a customized version from the [[apothecary]].  During the same visit, Dixon also orders [[laudanum]], a well-known constipating agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Pynchon | first = Thomas | title = Mason &amp; Dixon | publisher = Penguin | year = 1997 | location = New York | page = 267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daffy's elixir is also mentioned in the [[Charles Dickens]] book, [[Oliver Twist]], Ch. II, where it is referred to as Daffy, in the sentence: 'Why, it's what I'm obliged to keep a little of in the house, to put into the blessed infants' Daffy, when they ain't well, Mr. Bumble,(the Parish [[Beadle]])' replied Mrs. Mann as she opened a corner cupboard, and took down a bottle and glass. 'It's gin. I'll not deceive you, Mr. B. It's gin.'

Daffy’s Elixir is also mentioned in the [[Works of William Makepeace Thackeray]] book, [[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]], Chapter XXXVIII A Family In a Small Way, where it is referenced in the sentence ‘..and there found Mrs. Sedley  in the act of surreptitiously administering Daffy’s Elixir to the infant.’

== Early advertisements ==

''Daffy’s original elixir salutis, vindicated against all counterfeits, &amp;c. or, An advertisement by mee, Anthony Daffy, of London, citizen and student in physick, By way of vindication of my famous and generally approved cordial drink, (called elixir salutis) from the notoriously false suggestions of one Tho.

'''Detoxification foot pads''' are adhesive foot pads or patches that manufacturers claim can dramatically improve health when placed under the feet during sleep. Some of these pads may contain ingredients such as "distilled bamboo [[vinegar]]" that allegedly pull toxins from the body, but critics have shown that the process is not scientifically viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebeautybrains.com/2008/01/10/can-kinoki-detox-foot-pads-save-your-sole/|title=Can Kinoki Detox Foot Pads Save Your Sole?|date=2008-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Stossel/story?id=4636224 Ridding Yourself of Toxins, or Money?], ''[[ABC News]]'' 11 April 2008, retrieved 17 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 3, 2008, the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) released an urgent warning&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/ora/fiars/ora_import_ia6641.html FDA warning], January 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; regarding the potential dangers of many imported pharmaceutical substances including several brands of detox foot patches. In April 2008, in response to questions from the [[Associated Press]], an FDA spokeswoman said regarding the agency's investigation of the claims made for Kinoki foot pads that "basically, when we open up a case it means that the violation might be in terms of the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act, such as when (product makers) make false, misleading claims."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presstelegram.com/business/20080415/fda-launches-kinoki-foot-pad-inquiry  FDA launches Kinoki Foot Pad inquiry], Associated Press, 14 April 2008, retrieved 16 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, [[National Public Radio]] commissioned a laboratory test to look for heavy metals in used pads, which Kinoki claims are extracted from the body.  The test found none.  NPR also discovered that the pads change from white to grey when they are exposed to moisture, including sweat, and not necessarily because they are absorbing other substances.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93710963 Japanese Foot Pad Is Latest Health Fad] by Sarah Varney. NPR, All Things Considered, 18 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese company Kenrico claim that their pads have a positive effect on the health of the users,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kenrico.com/research-defensor2.html "Phase 4 Clinical Study of TRMX-3 ® in Boosting Mental &amp; Physical Health"]. ''Kenrico Research &amp; Peer Review Studies''. Retrieved 13 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and that they remove heavy metals from the body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kenrico.com/research-heavymetalsdetox-a.html "Heavy Metals Research (January 18th, 2005)"]. ''Kenrico Research &amp; Peer Review Studies''. Retrieved 13 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that these products work and although the skin is one of the bodies largest organs of detoxification, there is no proposed mechanism as to why these patches would increase the detoxification rate above baseline.

'''Earthquake sensitivity''' and '''earthquake sensitive''' are [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] terms defined by [[Jim Berkland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Orey|2006|p=261}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to certain people who claim sensitivity to the precursors of impending earthquakes, manifested in "dreams or visions, psychic impressions, or physiological symptoms", the latter including "ear tones" ([[Ringing (medicine)|ringing in the ears]]), headaches, and agitation. It is claimed that "[a] person with a very sensitive body may also have some subtle reaction to whatever animals react to".&lt;ref&gt;Reneau Z. Peurifoy, quoted in {{Harvnb|Orey|2006|pp=65–66}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents have speculated&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Orey|2006|p=66}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that these may result from: 1) [[piezoelectric effect]]s due to changes in the stress of the earth's crust, 2) low-frequency electromagnetic signals, or 3) from the emission of [[radon]] gas.

Although proponents suggest the ''possibility'' that the claimed effects might work through known physical phenomena, and thus be amenable to scientific study, these claims are pseudoscientific&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shermer|1997|p=33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in that no evidence of such effects, nor any theory of how such effects might be perceived, has been presented in the scientific literature.  What the scientific literature does have is various reports showing that animals do ''not'' show disturbed or altered behavior attributable to earthquake precursors&lt;ref&gt;In several studies direct observation of animals showed no signs of anomalous animal behavior preceding an earthquake ({{Harvnb|Lighton|Duncan|2005}}; {{Harvnb|Kenagy|Enright|1979}}; {{Harvnb|Lindberg|Skiles|Hayden|1981}}). A study of anomalous animal behavior reported to a hotline ''prior'' to an earthquake found no significant increase ({{Harvnb|Otis|Kautz| 1979}}). A claim that advertisements for missing pets increase prior to an earthquake (also touted by Berkland as a means for predicting earthquakes &amp;#91;{{Harvnb|Orey|2006|p=263}}&amp;#93;) was disproven by {{Harvtxt|Schaal|1988}}.
&lt;br /&gt;
Animals have been observed reacting to the P-waves that may arrive some tens of seconds before the more severe, but slower, S-waves. However, the P-waves do not precede the earthquake, but only the arrival of the S-waves at locations distant from an earthquake that has already happened.&lt;/ref&gt; (other than foreshocks &lt;ref&gt;Animals, like humans, do react to foreshocks. However, foreshocks are not reliable earthquake precursors: in some cases they are followed by a larger earthquake, but in many cases they are not, and as yet no way has been found to determine whether any cluster or swarm of small earthquakes will lead to an imminent, larger earthquake ({{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=336}}; {{Harvnb|Brodsky|Lay|2014}}).&lt;/ref&gt;). Aside from whether such phenomena can be ''detected'' (by any means), the "consistent failure to find reliable earthquake precursors"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zechar|Jordan|2008|p=723}}. {{Harvtxt|Geller|1997|p=425}} had previously noted that "[e]xtensive searches have failed to find reliable precursors." A assessment in 2011 again noted that, despite a century of study, "[t]he search for diagnostic precursors has thus far been unsuccessful" ({{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=338}}).&lt;/ref&gt; has led many scientists to question whether such precursor phenomena even exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Geller|Jackson|Kagan|Mulargia|1997}}; {{Harvnb|Matthews|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Could "earthquake sensitives" be responding to some kind of "psychic impressions" or other paranormal phenomena as yet unknown to science? After reviewing the scientific literature the ''International Commission on Earthquake Forecasting for Civil Protection'' (ICEF)&lt;ref&gt;A panel of internationally recognized earthquake experts convened at the request of the Italian government after the [[2009 L'Aquila earthquake]].&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that {{quotation|there is no credible scientific evidence that animals display behaviors indicative of earthquake-related environmental disturbances that are unobservable by the physical and chemical sensor systems available to earthquake scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=336}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On their side, the proponents claim that there have been "many scientific papers" supporting their views,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Orey|2006|p=29}}. {{Harvtxt|Geller|1997|p=432}} and the {{Harvtxt|ICEF|2011|p=336}} reviewed a number of such papers. Such papers are generally collections of anecdotal reports that lack scientific validity. Geller describes them as "doubly dubious".&lt;/ref&gt; but "most have been totally rejected by the keepers of high wisdom."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Orey|2006|p=29}}. [[Susan Hough]], a seismologist at the U.S. Geological Survey, notes "variations on a drumbeat theme that we are hegemonical, close-minded, unwilling to acknowledge or accept breakthroughs that come from outside the ranks." {{Harv|Hough|2010|p=166}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While scientists are quick to dismiss theories they "know, or have good reason to believe, are not credible",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hough|2010|p=165}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and especially predictions by amateurs on account of their lack of scientific rigor,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hough|2010|p=165}}. In [[seismology]] an earthquake prediction must specify the ''time'', ''location'', and ''magnitude'' of a future earthquake with sufficient specificity that measures can be taken that will mitigate serious harm {{Harv|Geller|1997|p=425}}. Any evaluation of a prediction method must specify its failure rate as well as its success rate, with complete documentation of ''all'' predictions to avoid "cherry picking" of just the successful cases. To be deemed successful prediction methods must be statistically significant. That is, successful beyond random chance {{Harv|Mulargia|Gasperini|1992|p=32}}. Amateurs seldom understand the need for such rigor, and even scientists are occasionally criticized for being vague and ambiguous {{Harv|Geller|1996|p=436}}, or failing to consider alternative explanations (e.g., {{Harvnb|McClellan|1980}}). See [[Earthquake prediction]] for more information.&lt;/ref&gt;
proponents claim that successful predictions can indicate a significant breakthrough, even if the details are not understood.&lt;ref&gt;Berkland has said: "The only real test of the efficiency of a predictive method is: How close do future events correspond to the earlier extrapolations?" {{Harv|Berkland|1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard Berkland claims "a 75 percent accuracy rate of forecasting quakes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Orey|2006|p=45}}. This statement is problematical. For seismologists ''forecasting'' usually means a probabilistic estimate of ''general'' earthquake hazard, of the frequency and magnitude of earthquakes in a given area, generally over periods of years or decades. ''Prediction'' is distinguished as a definite statement of the time and magnitude of the ''next'' earthquake expected in a given area. In this instance it appears that "forecast" is being used in the sense of ''prediction''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these results (besides being disputed&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hunter|2006}} analyzed Berkland's predictions, and found them no better than chance.&lt;/ref&gt;) are irrelevant in demonstrating any kind of "earthquake sensitive" effect as Berkland's predictions appear to not involve such effects.&lt;ref&gt;In 1990 Berkland described his method as the "Seismic Window Theory" (based on tidal stresses when the sun and moon are aligned, known as [[Syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]]) {{Harv|Berkland|1990}}. {{Harvtxt|Orey|2006|p=29}} described Berkland's method as the"Three Double G" system: 1) "the gravity gradient, or the forces exacted on the earth by the gravitational pull of the Sun and the Moon." 2) "Gone Gatos" – missing cats, as indicated by advertisements in several newspapers. 3) "Geyser Gaps", seen as irregularities in the behavior of a geyser in the Napa Valley. {{Harvtxt|Hunter|2006}} found "a hodge-podge of factors", but apparently none of these involve human sensitivities of any kind.&lt;/ref&gt;

Berkland ceased posting his predictions after June 2010. Though a few others have continued to post their predictions on Berkland's website, there appears to be no effort to correlate "ear tones" or any other physiological effect with subsequent earthquakes.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Electromagnetic hypersensitivity''' ('''EHS''') is a claimed sensitivity to [[electromagnetic fields]], to which negative symptoms are attributed. EHS has no scientific basis and is not a recognised [[medical diagnosis]]. Claims are characterized by a "variety of non-specific symptoms, which afflicted individuals attribute to exposure to [[electromagnetic field]]s".&lt;ref name=who&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.who.int/peh-emf/publications/facts/fs296/en/ |title= Electromagnetic fields and public health: Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity|publisher= World Health Organisation (WHO) |work= WHO Factsheet 296|date=December 2005|accessdate= 2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--causes--&gt;
Those who are self-described with EHS report adverse reactions to electromagnetic fields at intensities well below the maximum levels permitted by international [[Mobile phone radiation and health#Safety standards and licensing|radiation safety standards]].  The majority of [[Provocation (medical)|provocation trials]] to date have found that such claimants are unable to distinguish between exposure and non-exposure to electromagnetic fields.&lt;ref name="pmid15784787"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Roosli2008/&gt; A systematic review in 2005 showed no convincing scientific evidence for symptoms being caused by electromagnetic fields.&lt;ref name="pmid15784787"/&gt; Since then, several [[Blind experiment#Double-blind trials|double-blind experiments]] have shown that people who report electromagnetic hypersensitivity are unable to detect the presence of electromagnetic fields and are as likely to report ill health following a sham exposure as they are following exposure to genuine electromagnetic fields, suggesting the cause in these cases to be the [[nocebo|nocebo effect]].&lt;ref name=regeletal2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=RubinPrim2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilen,16304699&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Wilén J, Johansson A, Kalezic N, Lyskov E, Sandström M |title= Psychophysiological tests and provocation of subjects with mobile phone related symptoms |journal= Bioelectromagnetics. |volume= 27|issue=3 |pages=204–14 |year=2006 |pmid=16304699 |doi= 10.1002/bem.20195|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--management--&gt;
A 2005 review by the UK [[Health Protection Agency]] and a 2006 systematic review each evaluated the evidence for various medical, psychological, behavioral, and alternative treatments for EHS and each found that the evidence-base was limited and not generalizable, but that the best evidence favored [[cognitive behavioural therapy]].&lt;ref name=RubinTreat2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=irvine2005 /&gt;  As of 2005, [[WHO]] recommended that people presenting with claims of EHS be evaluated to determine if they have a medical condition that may be causing the symptoms the person is attributing to EHS, that they have a psychological evaluation, and that the person's environment be evaluated for issues like air or [[noise pollution]] that may be causing problems.&lt;ref name="who"/&gt;

&lt;!--Society and culture--&gt;
Some people who feel they are sensitive to electromagnetic fields may seek to reduce their exposure or use [[alternative medicine]].&lt;ref name="rooslietal2004"/&gt; Government agencies have enforced false advertising claims against companies selling devices to shield against EM radiation.&lt;ref name=FTCenforce&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fair|first1=Lesley|title=Federal Trade Commission Advertising Enforcement|url=https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/training-materials/enforcement.pdf|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|pages=18–19|date=March 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UKenforce/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
There are no specific symptoms associated with claims of EHS and reported symptoms range widely between individuals.&lt;ref name=who/&gt; They include headache, fatigue, stress, sleep disturbances, skin prickling, burning sensations and rashes, pain and ache in muscles and many other health problems. In severe cases such symptoms can be a real and sometimes disabling problem for the affected person, causing psychological distress.&lt;ref name=rooslietal2004 /&gt; There is no scientific basis to link such symptoms to electromagnetic field exposure.&lt;ref name=who/&gt;

The prevalence of some reported symptoms is geographically or culturally dependent and does not imply "a causal relationship between symptoms and attributed exposure".&lt;ref name=irvine2005&gt;[http://www.hpa.org.uk/Publications/Radiation/HPARPDSeriesReports/HpaRpd010/ "Definition, epidemiology and management of electrical sensitivity"], Irvine, N, Report for the Radiation Protection Division of the UK Health Protection Agency, HPA-RPD-010, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sage |first=Cindy |title=Microwave And Radiofrequency Radiation Exposure: A Growing Environmental Health Crisis? |work= |publisher=San Francisco Medical Society web page |url=http://www.sfms.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;template=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=1770 |doi= |accessdate=2008-05-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515232743/http://www.sfms.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;template=%2FCM%2FHTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=1770 |archivedate=2008-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many such reported symptoms overlap with other syndromes known as [[Medically unexplained physical symptoms|symptom-based conditions]], [[Somatization disorder|functional somatic syndromes]], and IEI ([[Multiple chemical sensitivity|idiopathic environmental intolerance]]).&lt;ref name=irvine2005 /&gt;

Those reporting electromagnetic hypersensitivity will usually describe different levels of susceptibility to [[electric field]]s, [[magnetic field]]s, and various frequencies of [[electromagnetic waves]].

==Causes==
Most blinded conscious provocation studies have failed to show a correlation between exposure and symptoms, leading to the suggestion that psychological mechanisms play a role in causing or exacerbating EHS symptoms. In 2010, Rubin et al. published a follow-up to their 2005 review, bringing the totals to 46 double-blind experiments and 1175 individuals with self-diagnosed hypersensitivity.&lt;ref name="pmid15784787"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Rubin GJ, Das Munshi J, Wessely S |title=Electromagnetic hypersensitivity: a systematic review of provocation studies |journal=Psychosom Med |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=224–32 |year=2005 |pmid=15784787 |doi=10.1097/01.psy.0000155664.13300.64 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RubinProvReview2010&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=James Rubin |author2=Rosa Nieto-Hernandez |author3=Simon Wessely | title = Idiopathic Environmental Intolerance Attributed to Electromagnetic Fields | journal = Bioelectromagnetics | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–11 |date= 2010 | pmid=19681059 | doi = 10.1002/bem.20536 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both reviews found no robust evidence to support the hypothesis that electromagnetic exposure causes EHS, as have other studies.&lt;ref name=regeletal2006&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Sabine Regel |author2=Sonja Negovetic |author3=Martin Röösli |author4=Veronica Berdiñas |author5=Jürgen Schuderer |author6=Anke Huss |author7=Urs Lott |author8=Niels Kuster |author9=Peter Achermann |title=UMTS Base Station-like Exposure, Well-Being, and Cognitive Performance |journal=Environ Health Perspect |volume=114 |issue=8 |pages=1270–75 |date=August 2006 |url=http://www.ehponline.org/members/2006/8934/8934.html |doi=10.1289/ehp.8934 |pmid=16882538 |pmc=1552030 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010073038/http://www.ehponline.org/members/2006/8934/8934.html |archivedate=2007-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RubinPrim2006&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=J Rubin |author2=G Hahn |author3=BS Everitt |author4=AJ Clear |author5=Simon Wessely | title = Are some people sensitive to mobile phone signals?

==Diagnosis==
Electromagnetic hypersensitivity is not an accepted diagnosis; medically there is no case definition or clinical practice guideline and there is no specific test to identify it, nor is there an agreed-upon definition with which to conduct clinical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baliatsas C, Van Kamp I, Lebret E, Rubin GJ |title=Idiopathic environmental intolerance attributed to electromagnetic fields (IEI-EMF): a systematic review of identifying criteria |journal=BMC Public Health |volume=12 |issue= |page=643 |year=2012 |pmid=22883305 |pmc=3504528 |doi=10.1186/1471-2458-12-643 |type=Systematic review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complaints of electromagnetic hypersensitivity may mask organic or psychiatric illness. Diagnosis of those underlying conditions involves investigating and identifying possible known medical causes of any symptoms observed.&lt;ref name="who"/&gt; It may require both a thorough medical evaluation to identify and treat any specific conditions that may be responsible for the symptoms, and a psychological evaluation to identify alternative psychiatric/psychological conditions that may be responsible or contribute to the symptoms.&lt;ref name="who"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18157992"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Rubin GJ, Cleare AJ, Wessely S |title=Psychological factors associated with self-reported sensitivity to mobile phones |journal=J Psychosom Res |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=1–9; discussion 11–2 |date=January 2008 |pmid=18157992 |doi=10.1016/j.jpsychores.2007.05.006 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Symptoms may also be brought on by imagining that exposure is causing harm, an example of the [[nocebo effect]]. Studies have shown that reports of symptoms are more closely associated with belief that one is being exposed than with any actual exposure.&lt;ref name=regeletal2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=RubinPrim2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilen,16304699/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4072|number=72|title=Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity: Real or Imagined?|accessdate=27 December 2016|quote="The ability of a human brain to convince itself of just about anything is not to be underestimated. If you believe yourself to be electrosensitive, then you will be, quite literally, whenever you (think that you) perceive the presence of electromagnetism... you will actually suffer measurable physical symptoms and can potentially become acutely ill."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
A 2006 systematic review and a 2005 review by the UK Health Protection Agency each evaluated the evidence for various medical, psychological, behavioral, and alternative treatments for EHS and each found that the evidence-base was limited and not generalizable.&lt;ref name=RubinTreat2006&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Rubin GJ, Das Munshi J, Wessely S |title=A systematic review of treatments for electromagnetic hypersensitivity |journal=Psychother Psychosom |volume=75 |issue=1 |pages=12–18 |year=2006 |pmid=16361870 |doi=10.1159/000089222}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=irvine2005 /&gt;  The conclusion of the 2006 review stated: "The evidence base concerning treatment options for electromagnetic hypersensitivity is limited and more research is needed before any definitive clinical recommendations can be made. However, the best evidence currently available suggests that cognitive behavioural therapy is effective for patients who report being hypersensitive to weak electromagnetic fields."&lt;ref name=RubinTreat2006/&gt;

As of 2005, WHO recommended that people presenting with claims of EHS be evaluated to determine if they have a medical condition that may be causing the symptoms the person is attributing to EHS, that they have a psychological evaluation, and that the person's environment be evaluated for issues like air or noise pollution that may be causing problems.&lt;ref name="who"/&gt;

==Prevalence==
The prevalence of claimed electromagnetic hypersensitivity has been estimated as being between a few cases per million to 5% of the population depending on the location and definition of the condition.

In 2002, a [[questionnaire]] survey of 2,072 people in California found that the prevalence of self-reported electromagnetic hypersensitivity within the sample group was 3% (95% CI 2.8–3.68%), with electromagnetic hypersensitivity being defined as "being allergic or very sensitive to getting near electrical appliances, computers, or power lines" (response rate 58.3%).&lt;ref name=levallois2002&gt;{{Cite journal

A similar questionnaire survey from the same year in Stockholm County (Sweden), found a 1.5% prevalence of self-reported electromagnetic hypersensitivity within the sample group, with electromagnetic hypersensitivity being defined as "hypersensitivity or allergy to electric or magnetic fields" (response rate 73%).&lt;ref name=hillertetal2002 /&gt;

A 2004 survey in Switzerland found a 5% prevalence of claimed electromagnetic hypersensitivity in the sample group of 2,048.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Schreier N, Huss A, Röösli M |title=The prevalence of symptoms attributed to electromagnetic field exposure: a cross-sectional representative survey in Switzerland |journal=Soz Praventivmed |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=202–09 |year=2006 |pmid=17193782 |doi=10.1007/s00038-006-5061-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, a UK survey aimed at a randomly selected group of 20,000 people found a prevalence of 4% for symptoms self-attributed to electromagnetic exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Eltiti S, Wallace D, Zougkou K, etal |title=Development and evaluation of the electromagnetic hypersensitivity questionnaire |journal=Bioelectromagnetics |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=137–51 |date=February 2007 |pmid=17013888 |doi=10.1002/bem.20279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
In 2010, a cell tower operator in [[South Africa]] revealed at a public meeting that the tower that nearby residents were blaming for their current EHS symptoms had been turned off over six weeks prior to the meeting, thus making it a highly unlikely cause of EHS symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Massive revelation in iBurst tower battle|url=https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wireless/11099-massive-revelation-in-iburst-tower-battle.html|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Electrosensitives tortured by a radio tower that had been switched off for six weeks|url=http://boingboing.net/2010/01/15/electrosensitives-to.html|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, the [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] found that claims of harm from electromagnetic radiation, made in a product advertisement, were unsubstantiated and misleading.&lt;ref name=UKenforce&gt;{{cite web|title=ASA Ruling on The Healthy House Ltd|url=https://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2014/2/The-Healthy-House-Ltd/SHP_ADJ_248892.aspx#.WBfvIeErKV4|publisher=UK Advertising Standards Authority|date=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People have filed lawsuits to try to win damages due to harm claimed from electromagnetic radiation. In 2012, a New Mexico judge dismissed a lawsuit in which one person sued his neighbor, claiming to have been harmed by EM radiation from his neighbor's cordless telephones, dimmer switches, chargers, Wi-Fi and other devices.

[[Gro Harlem Brundtland]], former [[prime minister]] of [[Norway]] and [[Director general]] of the [[World Health Organization]], claims to suffer from EHS.&lt;ref&gt;Aud Dalsegg; [https://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/far-hodesmerter-av-mobilstraling/65792704 Får hodesmerter av mobilstråling], ''Daglbadet'', 9 March 2002 (In Norwegian).

In the fictional television [[crime drama]] ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', the character [[Chuck McGill|Charles "Chuck" McGill]] is depicted as experiencing the symptoms of EHS. In the episode ''[[Alpine Shepherd Boy]]'', a skeptical doctor surreptitiously operates a switch controlling the electronics in Chuck's hospital bed.

The '''Gibilmanna Observatory''' is a research station used for a diverse range of studies set up and run by the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV)&lt;ref&gt;Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (IGNV)&lt;/ref&gt; and it is located on Cozzo Timpa Rossa at 1005 m.a.s.l. near [[Cefalù]], a town in the district of [[Palermo]], [[Italy]].

It is one of the 120 stations of the Italian Magnetic Network&lt;ref&gt;Italian Magnetic Network&lt;/ref&gt; measuring Earth magnetism field in Italy, and in 2005 INGV's Centro Nazionale Terremoti (CNT) selected it to set up the OBS Lab &lt;ref&gt;D'Anna G. et al (2009), Il Nuovo OBS/H dell'INGV", Quaderni di Geofisica, n29, pag. 7&lt;/ref&gt; aimed at designing, manufacturing and managing the [[Ocean-Bottom Seismometer]] with Hydrophone (OBS/H), later deployed for monitoring the Marsili submarine volcano in the [[Tyrrhenian sea]].

In addition, the observatory is one of the 110 Data Collection Platform (D.C.P.)&lt;ref&gt;Data Collection Platform (DCP)&lt;/ref&gt; stations of the [[Aeronautica Militare Italiana]] for automatic weather data gathering and transmission to the [[METEOSAT]] satellite.
Since 1976 this station has also been equipped for Ionospheric research and it is the most southern station of its kind in Europe. Real time ionograms are recorded by the INGV own developed AIS-INGV ionosonde installed at the station and reported on the INGV ionospheric website.&lt;ref&gt;Ionospheric Station of Gibilmanna&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2354">The '''Gold effect''' is the phenomenon in which a [[scientific]] idea, particularly in [[medicine]], is developed to the status of an accepted position within a professional body or association by the social process itself of [[Academic conference|scientific conferences]], committees, and consensus building, despite not being supported by [[Scientific evidence|conclusive evidence]]. The effect was described by Professor [[Thomas Gold|T. Gold]] in 1979.{{R|"Lyttleton"}} The effect was reviewed by Drs. [[Petr Skrabanek]] and James McCormick in their book ''Follies and Fallacies in Medicine''.{{R|"Skrabanek"}} The Gold effect is used to analyze errors in [[public health policy]] and practice, such as the widespread use of [[Hypercholesterolemia#Screening|cholesterol screening]] in the prevention of [[cardiovascular disease]].{{R|"Hann"}}

In their book, Skrabanek and McCormick describe the Gold effect as: "At the beginning a few people arrive at a state of near belief in some idea. A meeting is held to discuss the pros and cons of the idea. More people favouring the idea than those disinterested will be present. A representative committee will be nominated to prepare a collective volume to propagate and foster interest in the idea. The totality of resulting articles based on the idea will appear to show an increasing consensus. A specialised journal will be launched. Only orthodox or near orthodox articles will pass the referees and the editor."

'''Height Modernization''' is the name of a series of state-by-state programs recently begun by the United States' [[National Geodetic Survey]], a division of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]. The goal of each state program is to place [[global positioning satellite|GPS]] base stations at various locations within each participating state to measure topographic changes in the directions of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] caused by [[subsidence]] or [[earthquakes]], as well as to measure changes in height (elevation).

A '''hologram bracelet''' or ''' energy bracelet'''&lt;ref name="SBD29102011" /&gt; is a small [[gel bracelet|rubber wristband]] supposedly fitted with a [[hologram]]. Manufacturers have said supposedly that the holograms "optimise the natural flow of [[energy (esotericism)|energy]] around the body, and supposedly improve an athlete's strength, balance and flexibility".&lt;ref name="Telegraph15102010" /&gt; Only [[anecdotal evidence]] supports these claims and tests performed by the [[Australian Skeptics]],&lt;ref name="Guard01082010" /&gt; the [[University of Wales Institute, Cardiff]],&lt;ref name="BBC22112010"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-11805616 Power Balance band is placebo, say expert], [[BBC News]], 22 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[RMIT]]'s School of Health Sciences&lt;ref name="Brice" /&gt; have been unable to identify any effect on performance.

==Response==
Mark Hodgkinson, writing in the [[Daily Telegraph]] in 2010, called hologram bracelets a fad&lt;ref name="Telegraph15102010" /&gt; with many professional athletes seen wearing them and several actively endorsing them. Footballers [[David Beckham]]&lt;ref name="Telegraph15102010" /&gt;  and [[Cristiano Ronaldo]]&lt;ref name="Guard01082010"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/aug/01/sports-sensation-power-balance|title=Sport's latest sensation: a rubbery bracelet|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|author=Patrick Kingsley|date=1 August 2010|accessdate=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; have worn them, and tennis players [[Sam Querrey]] and [[Mardy Fish]] both wore them during the final of the [[2010 Queen's Club Championships]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph15102010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guard01082010"/&gt; Endorsements for the Power Balance bracelet have come from [[Shaquille O'Neal]], [[Rubens Barrichello]],&lt;ref name="Telegraph15102010" /&gt; and the [[Wasps RFC|London Wasps]] rugby team,&lt;ref name="Guard01082010"/&gt; while ice hockey team the [[Cardiff Devils]] announced a partnership with Power Balance in early 2010.&lt;ref name="BBC22112010" /&gt; [[NASCAR]] reported in 2011 that many drivers wore EFX Performance bracelets with the [[Hendrick Motorsports]] and [[Stewart-Haas Racing]] teams entering into licensing deals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/news/110513/efx-hendrick-stewart-haas/index.html|title=EFX Performance partners with Hendrick, SHR|publisher=NASCAR.com|date=13 May 2011|accessdate=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several groups have investigated the effects of hologram bracelets on athletic performance. A 2011 study by RMIT University's School of Health Sciences found that there was an overall decrease in the balance and stability of wearers, although it was not statistically significant and the overall conclusion was that the bracelets had no effect on performance.&lt;ref name="Brice"&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Bodyw Mov Ther |year=2011 |volume=15 |issue = 3 |pages=298–303 |title= The effect of close proximity holographic wristbands on human balance and limits of stability: A randomised, placebo-controlled trial |vauthors=Brice SR, Jarosz BS, Ames RA, Baglin J, Da Costa C |url= |doi= 10.1016/j.jbmt.2011.01.020|pmid=21665105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australian Skeptics]] group found that the bracelets has no more than a placebo effect.&lt;ref name="Guard01082010" /&gt;

Research by the [[University of Wales Institute, Cardiff]], commissioned by the BBC, also found that wearing the bracelets had no effect on performance in standard sports industry tests, adding that neither the physiology or the biology of wearers was changed.&lt;ref name="BBC22112010"/&gt; However, Dr Gareth Irwin who carried out the tests said that there may be changes in performance because of the [[placebo effect]], a view which has been echoed by sports psychologists.&lt;ref name="Time04102010"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2021057,00.html|title=Wrist Watch|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=Bruce Crumley|date=4 October 2010|accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sports psychologist Victor Thompson says the bracelets play on superstition, simply giving people the expectation that they can improve their sporting performance.&lt;ref name="Guard01082010" /&gt; Cricket coach [[Jeremy Snape]] said he prefers that athletes have belief in themselves rather than in an external product, while Roberto Forzoni described the bracelets as "gimmicks" which allow athletes to avoid addressing real issues in their performance, with the high-profile endorsements giving the sense of belonging to an elite group of athletes.&lt;ref name="Telegraph15102010" /&gt;

[[File:Hyland’s Teething Tablets (DSC 1575).jpg|thumb|right|Hyland's Teething Tablets]]
'''Hyland's''' is a brand of [[Homeopathy|homeopathic products]] sold in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].  Hyland's operates in the United States as Hyland's Inc and in Canada as Hyland’s Homeopathic Canada Inc and is a division of Standard Homeopathic Co..

== History ==
The company was founded in 1903 in Los Angeles as Standard Homeopathic Pharmacy.  It was purchased by George H. Hyland in 1910 and the name was changed to Standard Homeopathic Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=https://www.hylands.com/history|website=Hyland's Inc|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyland's began selling products in Canada in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.hylands.ca/history|website=Hyland's Homeopathic Canada Inc|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] conducted a review of Hyland's labeling and marketing information which revealed numerous products misbranded in violation of sections 503 and 301 of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act|Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C Act)]] [21 U.S.C. §§ 353 and 331]. This review included the products for "Infant Earache Drops," "Restful Legs," "Teething Tablets," and other products. The products are marketed as [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] for diagnoses and treatments that require a physician's consultation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2013/ucm370015.htm|title=2013 - Standard Homeopathic Company, Inc. 9/25/13|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety concerns==

'''Ian Pretyman Stevenson''' (October 31, 1918 – February 8, 2007) was a Canadian-born U.S. psychiatrist. He worked for the [[University of Virginia School of Medicine]] for fifty years, as chair of the department of psychiatry from 1957 to 1967, Carlson Professor of Psychiatry from 1967 to 2001, and Research Professor of Psychiatry from 2002 until his death.&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;[http://www.medicine.virginia.edu/clinical/departments/psychiatry/sections/cspp/dops/publicationslinks/Stevenson-s-Obit-Emily.pdf Kelly 2007].

As founder and director of the university's Division of Perceptual Studies, which investigates the [[paranormal]], Stevenson became known internationally for his research into [[reincarnation]], the idea that emotions, memories, and even physical bodily features can be transferred from one life to another.&lt;ref name=BMJ&gt;[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/334/7595/700 Hopkins Tanne (''British Medical Journal'')], April 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He traveled extensively over a period of forty years, investigating three thousand cases of children around the world who claimed to remember past lives.&lt;ref&gt;Woodhouse 1996, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dejmdCWwEHsC&amp;pg=PA143 pp. 143–144].

He believed that reincarnation provided a third type of explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Stevenson helped to found the [[Society for Scientific Exploration]] in 1982 and was the author of around three hundred papers and fourteen books on reincarnation, including ''[[Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation]]'' (1966) and ''[[European Cases of the Reincarnation Type]]'' (2003). His major work was the 2,268-page, two-volume ''Reincarnation and Biology: A Contribution to the Etiology of Birthmarks and Birth Defects'' (1997). This reported two hundred cases of birthmarks and birth defects that seemed to correspond in some way to a wound on the deceased person whose life the child recalled. He wrote a shorter version of the same research for the general reader, ''[[Where Reincarnation and Biology Intersect]]'' (1997).&lt;ref&gt;For his having been on the founding committee of the Society for Scientific Exploration, see {{cite web|url=http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/personalitystudies/Stevenson.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721165720/http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/personalitystudies/Stevenson.pdf |archive-date=July 21, 2006 |title=Stevenson 2006 |dead-url=yes |access-date=September 1, 2016 |df= }}, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reaction to his work was mixed. In his ''New York Times'' obituary, [[Margalit Fox]] wrote that Stevenson's supporters saw him as a misunderstood genius, but that most scientists had simply ignored his research and that his detractors regarded him as earnest but gullible.&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/18/health/psychology/18stevenson.html Fox (''The New York Times'')], February 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; His life and work became the subject of three supportive books, ''[[Old Souls: The Scientific Search for Proof of Past Lives]]'' (1999) by [[Tom Shroder]], a ''Washington Post'' journalist, ''[[Life Before Life]]'' (2005) by [[Jim B. Tucker]], a psychiatrist and colleague at the University of Virginia, and ''Science, the Self, and Survival after Death'' (2012), by Emily Williams Kelly. Critics, particularly the philosophers [[C.T.K. Chari]] (1909–1993) and [[Paul Edwards (philosopher)|Paul Edwards]] (1923–2004), raised a number of issues, including claims that the children or parents interviewed by Stevenson had deceived him, that he had asked them leading questions, that he had often worked through translators who believed what the interviewees were saying, and that his conclusions were undermined by [[confirmation bias]], where cases not supportive of his hypothesis were not presented as counting against it.&lt;ref name="Carroll"&gt;, [http://www.skepdic.com/stevenson.html Carroll 2009, article on his website ''The Skeptic's Dictionary''].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Personal life and education===
Stevenson was born in Montreal and raised in Ottawa, one of three children.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt; His father, John Stevenson, was a Scottish lawyer who was working in Ottawa as the Canadian correspondent for ''[[The Times]]'' of London or ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;For the London ''Times'', see [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/18/health/psychology/18stevenson.html Fox (''The New York Times'')], February 18, 2007.
*For the ''New York Times'', see [http://www.bmj.com/content/334/7595/700?tab=responses Pandarakalam (''British Medical Journal'')], April 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Ruth, had an interest in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] and an extensive library on the subject, to which Stevenson attributed his own early interest in the paranormal. As a child he was often bedridden with [[bronchitis]], a condition that continued into adulthood and engendered in him a lifelong love of books.&lt;ref name="Stevenson2006p13"/&gt; According to Emily Williams Kelly, a colleague of his at the University of Virginia, he maintained a list of the books he had read, which numbered 3,535 between 1935 and 2003.&lt;ref name=Kelly/&gt;

He studied medicine at [[University of St Andrews|St. Andrews University]] in Scotland from 1937 to 1939, but had to complete his studies in Canada because of the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref name=bmj2&gt;[http://www.bmj.com/rapid-response/2011/11/01/professor-ian-stevenson-emperor-parapsychology Pandarakalam (''British Medical Journal'')], April 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[McGill University]] with a B.S.c. in 1942 and an M.D. in 1943. He was married to Octavia Reynolds from 1947 until her death in 1983.&lt;ref name=Kelly/&gt; In 1985, he married Dr. Margaret Pertzoff (1926–2009), professor of history at [[Randolph-Macon Woman's College]]. She did not share his views on the paranormal, but tolerated them with what Stevenson called "benevolent silences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/personalitystudies/Stevenson.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721165720/http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/personalitystudies/Stevenson.pdf |archive-date=July 21, 2006 |title=Stevenson 2006 |dead-url=yes |access-date=September 1, 2016 |df= }}, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
After graduating, Stevenson conducted research in biochemistry. His first [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] was at the [[Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal|Royal Victoria Hospital]] in Montreal (1944–1945), but his lung condition continued to bother him, and one of his professors at McGill advised him to move to Arizona for his health.&lt;ref name=Stevenson2006p13&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/personalitystudies/Stevenson.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721165720/http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/personalitystudies/Stevenson.pdf |archive-date=July 21, 2006 |title=Stevenson 2006 |dead-url=yes |access-date=September 1, 2016 |df= }}, pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; He took up a residency at St. Joseph's Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona (1945–1946). After that, he held a fellowship in internal medicine at the Alton Ochsner Medical Foundation in New Orleans, became a Denis Fellow in Biochemistry at Tulane University School of Medicine (1946–1947), and a Commonwealth Fund Fellow in Medicine at Cornell University Medical College and New York Hospital (1947–1949).&lt;ref name=Kelly/&gt; He became a U.S. citizen in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;''World Who's in Science'' 1968, p. 1609.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kelly writes that Stevenson became dissatisfied with the [[reductionism]] he encountered in biochemistry, and wanted to study the whole person.&lt;ref name=Kelly/&gt; He became interested in [[psychosomatic medicine]], psychiatry and [[psychoanalysis]], and in the late 1940s, worked at New York Hospital exploring psychosomatic illness and the effects of [[Stress (psychological)|stress]], and in particular why one person's response to stress might be asthma and another's high blood pressure.&lt;ref name=Stevenson1989&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicine.virginia.edu/clinical/departments/psychiatry/sections/cspp/dops/publicationslinks/some-of-my-journeys-in-medicine.pdf |title=Stevenson 1989 |accessdate=2012-11-15 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720110857/http://www.medicine.virginia.edu/clinical/departments/psychiatry/sections/cspp/dops/publicationslinks/some-of-my-journeys-in-medicine.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He taught at [[Louisiana State University School of Medicine]] from 1949 to 1957 as assistant, then associate, professor of psychiatry. In the 1950s, he met the English writer [[Aldous Huxley]] (1894–1963), known for his advocacy of [[psychedelic drug]]s, and studied the effects of [[L.S.D.]] and [[mescaline]], one of the first academics to do so. Kelly writes that he tried L.S.D. himself, describing three days of "perfect serenity." He wrote that at the time he felt he could "never be angry again," but added, "As it happens that didn't work out, but the memory of it persisted as something to hope for."&lt;ref name=Kelly/&gt;

From 1951, he studied psychoanalysis at the New Orleans Psychoanalytic Institute and the Washington Psychoanalytic Institute, graduating from the latter in 1958, a year after being appointed head of the department of psychiatry at the University of Virginia.&lt;ref name=Kelly/&gt; He argued against the orthodoxy within psychiatry and psychoanalysis at the time that the personality is more [[neuroplasticity|plastic]] in the early years; his paper on the subject, "Is the human personality more plastic in infancy and childhood?" (''American Journal of Psychiatry'', 1957), was not received well by his colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;For the paper, see [http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=146529 Stevenson 1957], pp. 152–161.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that their response prepared him for the rejection he experienced over his work on the paranormal.&lt;ref name=Stevenson2006p13/&gt;

==Reincarnation research==

===Early interest===
Stevenson described as the [[leitmotif]] of his career his interest in why one person would develop one disease, and another something different.&lt;ref name=Stevenson1989/&gt; He came to believe that neither environment nor heredity could account for certain fears, illnesses and special abilities, and that some form of personality or memory transfer might provide a third type of explanation. He acknowledged, however, the absence of evidence of a physical process by which a personality could survive death and transfer to another body, and he was careful not to commit himself fully to the position that reincarnation occurs.&lt;ref&gt;For his failure to suggest a mechanism, see [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/10/AR2007021001393.html Shroder, February 11, 2007].&lt;/ref&gt;
*That he did not fully commit himself to one position, see Almeder 1992, [https://books.google.com/books?id=K8-_Vqq6r-cC&amp;pg=PA58 pp. 58–61].&lt;/ref&gt; He argued only that his case studies could not, in his view, be explained by environment or heredity, and that "reincarnation is the best – even though not the only – explanation for the stronger cases we have investigated."&lt;ref&gt;Tucker 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JuiGUbZTNTQCpg=PA211 p. 211].&lt;/ref&gt; His position was not a religious one, but represented what [[Robert F. Almeder|Robert Almeder]], professor emeritus of philosophy at Georgia State University, calls the minimalistic reincarnation hypothesis. Almeder states the hypothesis this way:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is something essential to some human personalities ... which we cannot plausibly construe solely in terms of either brain states, or properties of brain states ... and, further, after biological death this non-reducible essential trait sometimes persists for some time, in some way, in some place, and for some reason or other, existing independently of the person's former brain and body. Moreover, after some time, some of these irreducible essential traits of human personality, for some reason or other, and by some mechanism or other, come to reside in other human bodies either some time during the gestation period, at birth, or shortly after birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/jse_11_4_almeder.pdf Almeder 1997] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229061304/http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/jse_11_4_almeder.pdf |date=2009-12-29 }}, p. 502.
*Also see Almeder 1992, p. 35, discussing [[Paul Edwards (philosopher)|Paul Edwards]]'s criticism of Stevenson that the idea of an "astral body" existing in the interval between lives is incredible: "[W]e cannot, without begging the question against the case studies, argue that we ''know'' consciousness cannot exist with a brain. We know nothing of the sort. ... Moreover, the argument for reincarnation implies nothing specific about the nature of an 'astral body,' where it goes during the period between incarnations, how the astral body reincarnates, why it reincarnates, how frequently it reincarnates, whether everybody reincarnates, and what the point of it all is. As a matter of fact, given the cases involved, one need never mention the expression ''astral body''. The argument implies only that some core elements of human personality occasionally survive bodily corruption (and hence cannot be identified with the physical body) and reincarnate."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1958 and 1959, Stevenson contributed several articles and book reviews to ''[[Harper's]]'' about [[parapsychology]], including psychosomatic illness and [[extrasensory perception]], and in 1958, he submitted the winning entry to a competition organized by the [[American Society for Psychical Research]], in honor of the philosopher [[William James]] (1842–1910). The prize was for the best essay on "paranormal mental phenomena and their relationship to the problem of survival of the human personality after bodily death." Stevenson's essay, "The Evidence for Survival from Claimed Memories of Former Incarnations" (1960), reviewed forty-four published cases of people, mostly children, who claimed to remember past lives. It caught the attention of [[Eileen J. Garrett]] (1893–1970), the founder of the [[Parapsychology Foundation]], who gave Stevenson a grant to travel to India to interview a child who was claiming to have past-life memories. According to Jim Tucker, Stevenson found twenty-five other cases in just four weeks in India and was able to publish his first book on the subject in 1966, ''[[Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation]]''.&lt;ref name=Tucker2007&gt;For Stevenon's work in ''Harper's'', see {{cite web |url=http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/personalitystudies/Stevenson.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721165720/http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/personalitystudies/Stevenson.pdf |archive-date=July 21, 2006 |title=Stevenson 2006 |dead-url=yes |access-date=September 1, 2016 |df= }}, p. 13; [http://harpers.org/blog/author/ianstevenson/ "Ian Stevenson"], ''Harper's''.
*For the competition, see [http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/jse_21_3_tucker.pdf Tucker 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507023025/http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/jse_21_3_tucker.pdf |date=2012-05-07 }}, pp. 543–552.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chester Carlson]] (1906–1968), the inventor of [[xerography]], offered further financial help. Tucker writes that this allowed Stevenson to step down as chair of the psychiatry department and set up a separate division within the department, which he called the Division of Personality Studies, later renamed the Division of Perceptual Studies.&lt;ref name=divisionhistory&gt;[http://www.medicine.virginia.edu/clinical/departments/psychiatry/sections/cspp/dops/we_are-page#history "History and description"], Division of Perceptual Studies, University of Virginia.&lt;/ref&gt; When Carlson died in 1968, he left $1,000,000 to the University of Virginia to continue Stevenson's work. The bequest caused controversy within the university because of the nature of the research, but the donation was accepted, and Stevenson became the first Carlson Professor of Psychiatry.&lt;ref name=Stevenson2006p17&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/personalitystudies/Stevenson.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721165720/http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/personalitystudies/Stevenson.pdf |archive-date=July 21, 2006 |title=Stevenson 2006 |dead-url=yes |access-date=September 1, 2016 |df= }}, pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case studies==

===Overview===

The bequest allowed Stevenson to travel extensively, sometimes as much as 55,000 miles a year, collecting around three thousand case studies based on interviews with children from Africa to Alaska.&lt;ref name=Kelly/&gt;

According to journalist Tom Shroder, "In interviewing witnesses and reviewing documents, Dr. Stevenson searched for alternate ways to account for the testimony: that the child came upon the information in some normal way, that the witnesses were engaged in fraud or self-delusion, that the correlations were the result of coincidence or misunderstanding. But in scores of cases, Dr. Stevenson concluded that no normal explanation sufficed."&lt;ref name=Shroder2007&gt;{{cite news |last=Shroder |first=Tom |date=February 11, 2007 |title=Ian Stevenson; Sought To Document Memories Of Past Lives in Children|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/10/AR2007021001393.html |work=Washington Post|access-date=February 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, a child in a "past life" case may have birthmarks or birth defects that in some way correspond to physical features of the "previous person" whose life the child seems to remember. Stevenson's ''Reincarnation and Biology: A Contribution to the Etiology of Birthmarks and Birth Defects'' (1997) examined two hundred cases of birth defects or birthmarks on children claiming past-life memories. These included children with malformed or missing fingers who said they recalled the lives of people who had lost fingers; a boy with birthmarks resembling entrance and exit wounds who said he recalled the life of someone who had been shot; and a child with a scar around her skull three centimetres wide who said she recalled the life of a man who had had skull surgery. In many of the cases, in Stevenson's view, the witness testimony or autopsy reports appeared to support the existence of the injuries on the deceased's body.&lt;ref name=Tucker2007/&gt;

In the case of the boy who said he recalled the life of someone who had been shot, the sister of the deceased told Stevenson that her brother had shot himself in the throat. The boy had shown Stevenson a birthmark on his throat. Stevenson suggested that he might also have a birthmark on the top of his head, representing the exit wound, and found one there underneath the boy's hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kelly | first1 =  | last2 = Kelly | first2 =  | year = 2007 | title = p. 234, citing Stevenson | url = | journal = [[Reincarnation and Biology]] | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 728–745 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===

====Criticism====
The ''Journal of the American Medical Association'' referred to Stevenson’s ''Cases of the Reincarnation Type'' (1975) as a "painstaking and unemotional" collection of cases that were "difficult to explain on any assumption other than reincarnation."&lt;ref name=Edwards253/&gt; In September 1977, the ''[[Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease]]'' devoted most of one issue to Stevenson's research.&lt;ref name=Brody&gt;[http://journals.lww.com/jonmd/Citation/1977/09000/Research_in_Reincarnation_and_Editorial.1.aspx Brody, September 1977].&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in the journal, the psychiatrist [[Harold Lief]] described Stevenson as a methodical investigator and added, "Either he is making a colossal mistake, or he will be known (I have said as much to him) as 'the Galileo of the 20th century'."&lt;ref name=Lief&gt;[http://journals.lww.com/jonmd/Citation/1977/09000/Commentary_on_Dr__Ian_Stevenson_s__the_Evidence_of.3.aspx Lief, September 1977].&lt;/ref&gt; The issue proved popular: the journal's editor, the psychiatrist [[Eugene Brody]], said he had received 300–400 requests for [[Reprint#Academic publishing|reprints]].&lt;ref name=Edwards253&gt;Edwards 1996, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this early interest, most scientists ignored Stevenson's work. According to his ''New York Times'' obituary, his detractors saw him as "earnest, dogged but ultimately misguided, led astray by gullibility, wishful thinking and a tendency to see science where others saw superstition."&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt; Critics suggested that the children or their parents had deceived him, that he was too willing to believe them, and that he had asked them leading questions. In addition, critics said, the results were subject to [[confirmation bias]], in that cases not supportive of the hypothesis were not presented as counting against it.&lt;ref name=Carroll/&gt; Leonard Angel, a philosopher of religion, told ''The New York Times'' that Stevenson did not follow proper standards. "[B]ut you do have to look carefully to see it; that's why he's been very persuasive to many people."&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;

[[Skepticism|Skeptics]] have written that Stevenson's evidence was anecdotal and by applying [[Occam's razor]] there are prosaic explanations for the cases without invoking the paranormal.&lt;ref&gt;Rockley, Richard. (2002). [http://www.skepticreport.com/sr/?p=482 "Book Review: Children who Remember Previous Lives"]. SkepticReport. Retrieved 2014-10-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Science writer [[Terence Hines]] has written:

{{quote|The major problem with Stevenson’s work is that the methods he used to investigate alleged cases of reincarnation are inadequate to rule out simple, imaginative storytelling on the part of the children claiming to be reincarnations of dead individuals. In the seemingly most impressive cases Stevenson (1975, 1977) has reported, the children claiming to be reincarnated knew friends and relatives of the dead individual. The children’s knowledge of facts about these individuals is, then, somewhat less than conclusive evidence for reincarnation.&lt;ref&gt;Hines 2003, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Robert A. Baker|Robert Baker]] wrote that many of the alleged past-life experiences investigated by Stevenson and other parapsychologists can be explained in terms of known psychological factors. Baker attributed the recalling of past lives to a mixture of [[cryptomnesia]] and [[confabulation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert A. Baker|Robert Baker]]. (1996). ''Hidden Memories: Voices and Visions from Within''. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|0-87975-576-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ian Wilson (author)|Ian Wilson]] argued that a large number of Stevenson’s cases consisted of poor children remembering wealthy lives or belonging to a [[Caste system in India|higher caste]]. He speculated that such cases may represent a scheme to obtain money from the family of the alleged former incarnation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Wilson (author)|Ian Wilson]]. (1981). ''Mind Out of Time: Reincarnation Investigated''. Gollancz. {{ISBN|0-575-02968-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[C. T. K. Chari]] of [[Madras Christian College]] in Chennai, a specialist in parapsychology, argued that Stevenson was naive and that the case studies were undermined by his lack of local knowledge. Chari wrote that many of the cases had come from societies, such as that of India, where people believed in reincarnation, and that the stories were simply [[cultural artifact]]s; he argued that, for children in many Asian countries, the recall of a past life is the equivalent of an [[Imaginary friend|imaginary playmate]].&lt;ref&gt;C.T.K. Chari, "Reincarnation Research: Method and Interpretation," cited in Edwards 1996, p. 261.
*Also see Ian Stevenson (1986), "Reply to C.T.K. Chari," ''Journal of the Society for Psychical Research'', 53, pp. 474–475.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher Keith Augustine made a similar argument.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Augustine.

Number 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Stevenson responded that it was precisely those societies that listened to children's claims about past lives, which in Europe or North America would normally be dismissed without investigation.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/02/12/db1201.xml |title=''The Daily Telegraph'', February 12, 2007 |accessdate=2007-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070331045018/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2007%2F02%2F12%2Fdb1201.xml |archivedate=March 31, 2007 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; To address the cultural concern, he wrote ''[[European Cases of the Reincarnation Type]]'' (2003), which presented forty cases he had examined in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=177497 Cadoret 2005].&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Paul Edwards (philosopher)|Paul Edwards]], editor-in-chief of Macmillan's ''[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', became Stevenson's chief critic.&lt;ref&gt;That Edwards was Stevenson's "most formidable critic," see Bache 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cEL8eWF-vHgC&amp;pg=PA35 p. 35].&lt;/ref&gt; From 1986 onwards, he devoted several articles to Stevenson's work, and discussed Stevenson in his ''Reincarnation: A Critical Examination'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;Paul Edwards (1986), "The Case Against Reincarnation: Part 1," ''[[Free Inquiry]]'', 6, Fall, pp. 24–34.

*____________  (ed.) (1992), "Introduction," ''Immortality''. MacMillan.
*____________ (1996), ''Reincarnation: A Critical Examination''. Prometheus Books.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that Stevenson's views were "absurd nonsense" and that when examined in detail his case studies had "big holes" and "do not even begin to add up to a significant counterweight to the initial presumption against reincarnation."&lt;ref&gt;Edwards 1996, pp. 140, 256 (see chapter 16, pp. 253–278).&lt;/ref&gt; Stevenson, Edwards wrote, "evidently lives in a cloud-cuckoo-land." &lt;ref&gt;Edwards 1996, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

Champe Ransom, whom Stevenson hired as an assistant in the 1970s, wrote an unpublished report about Stevenson's work, which Edwards cites in his ''Immortality'' (1992) and ''Reincarnation'' (1996). According to Ransom, Edwards wrote, Stevenson asked the children leading questions, filled in gaps in the narrative, did not spend enough time interviewing them, and left too long a period between the claimed recall and the interview; it was often years after the first mention of a recall that Stevenson learned about it. In only eleven of the 1,111 cases Ransom looked at had there been no contact between the families of the deceased and of the child before the interview; in addition, according to Ransom, seven of those eleven cases were seriously flawed. He also wrote that there were problems with the way Stevenson presented the cases, in that he would report his witnesses' conclusions, rather than the data upon which the conclusions rested. Weaknesses in cases would be reported in a separate part of his books, rather than during the discussion of the cases themselves. Ransom concluded that it all amounted to anecdotal evidence of the weakest kind.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards 1992, pp. 13–14; Edwards 1996, p. 275; McClelland 2010, [https://books.google.com/books?id=S_Leq4U5ihkC&amp;pg=PA144 p. 144].&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Death and Personal Survival'' (1992), Almeder holds that Ransom was false in stating that there were only 11 cases with no prior contact between the two families concerned.. According to Almeder there were 23 such cases.&lt;ref name="34ff"&gt;Almeder 1992, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=K8-_Vqq6r-cC&amp;pg=PA34 34ff], [https://books.google.com/books?id=K8-_Vqq6r-cC&amp;pg=PA60 60].&lt;/ref&gt;

Edwards cited the case of Corliss Chotkin, Jr.,  in [[Angoon, Alaska]], described in Stevenson’s ''Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation'' (1966), as an example that relied entirely on the word of one woman, the niece of Victor Vincent, a fisherman.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson 1966, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vIDES6VWl1MC&amp;pg=PA259 p. 259ff].&lt;/ref&gt; (Victor Vincent was the person whose life Corliss Chotkin, Jr., seemed to remember.) Edwards wrote that, among the many weaknesses in the case, the family were religious believers in reincarnation, Chotkin had birthmarks that were said to have resembled scars that Vincent had but Stevenson had not seen Vincent's scars, and all the significant details relied on the niece. Edwards said that Stevenson offered no information about her, except that several people told him she had a tendency, as Stevenson put it, to embellish or invent stories. Edwards wrote that similar weaknesses could be found in all Stevenson's case studies.&lt;ref name=Edwards136&gt;Edwards 1996, pp. 136–138; Stevenson 1966, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vIDES6VWl1MC&amp;pg=PA259 pp. 259–269].&lt;/ref&gt; In Stevenson’s defense, Robert Almeder wrote in 1997 that the Chotkin case was one of Stevenson's weaker ones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/jse_11_4_almeder.pdf Almeder 1997] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229061304/http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/jse_11_4_almeder.pdf |date=2009-12-29 }}, pp. 510, 519.
*Also see Woodhouse 1996, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dejmdCWwEHsC&amp;pg=PA144 p. 144]: "[The paradigm war over reincarnation] has pitted Robert Almeder, a nationally distinguished philosopher of science, against Paul Edwards, general editor of the ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy''."&lt;/ref&gt;

Edwards charged that Stevenson referred to himself as a scientist but did not act like one. According to Edwards, he failed to respond to, or even mention, significant objections; the large bibliography in Stevenson's ''Children Who Remember Previous Lives'' (1987) does not include one paper or book from his opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards 1992, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Support====
In support of Stevenson, Almeder argued in ''Death and Personal Survival'' that Edwards had begged the question by stating in advance that the idea of consciousness existing without the brain in the interval between lives was incredible, and that Edwards's "dogmatic materialism" had forced him to the view that Stevenson's case studies must be examples of fraud or delusional thinking. According to Almeder, the possibility of fraud was indeed investigated in the cases Edwards mentioned.&lt;ref name="34ff"/&gt;

Stevenson wrote an introduction to a book, ''Second Time Round'' (1975), in which Edward Ryall, an Englishman, told of what he believed to be his memories of a past life as John Fletcher, a man who was born in 1645 in Taunton, England, and died forty years later near his home in [[Westonzoyland|Westonzoyland, Somerset]].&lt;ref&gt;Ian Stevenson. (1974). ''Introduction'' in Edward Ryall. ''Second Time Round.'' Neville Spearman. pp. 9–31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor1980&gt;[[John G. Taylor|John Taylor]]. (1980). ''Science and the Supernatural: An Investigation of Paranormal Phenomena Including Psychic Healing, Clairvoyance, Telepathy, and Precognition by a Distinguished Physicist and Mathematician''. Temple Smith. pp. 127-130. {{ISBN|0-85117-191-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stevenson investigated the case and discovered that some of the historical features from Ryall's book were accurate. Stevenson wrote, "I think it most probable that he has memories of a real previous life and that he is indeed John Fletcher reborn, as he believes himself to be".&lt;ref name=Taylor1980/&gt; In 1976, however, [[John G. Taylor|John Taylor]] discovered that none of the available church records at the Westonzoyland church from 1645 to 1685 had entries for births, marriages, or deaths for the name Fletcher. Since no trace of the name could be found, he concluded that no man called John Fletcher actually existed and that the supposed memories were a fantasy Ryall had developed over the years.&lt;ref name=Taylor1980/&gt; Stevenson later altered his opinion about the case. In his book ''[[European Cases of the Reincarnation Type]],'' he wrote, "I can no longer believe that ''all'' of Edward Ryall's apparent memories derive from a previous life, because some of his details are clearly wrong," but he still suggested that Ryall acquired some information about 17th-century Somerset by paranormal means.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Stevenson. (2003). ''[[European Cases of the Reincarnation Type]]''. McFarland. pp. 230-231. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-4249-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article published on ''Scientific American's'' website in 2013, favorably reviewing Stevenson's work, Jesse Bering, a professor of science communication, wrote, "Towards the end of her own storied life, the physicist Doris Kuhlmann-Wilsdorf—whose groundbreaking theories on surface physics earned her the prestigious Heyn Medal from the German Society for Material Sciences, surmised that Stevenson’s work had established that 'the statistical probability that reincarnation does in fact occur is so overwhelming … that cumulatively the evidence is not inferior to that for most if not all branches of science.'

== Xenoglossy ==
Although Stevenson mainly focused on cases of children who seemed to remember past lives, he also studied two cases in which adults under hypnosis seemed to remember a past life and show rudimentary use of a language they had not learned in the present life. Stevenson called this phenomenon "xenoglossy."&lt;ref&gt;Matlock, James G. "Ian Stevenson." http://jamesgmatlock.net/resources/researchers/stevenson/ The term was coined in the early 1900s by C. Richet. https://med.virginia.edu/perceptual-studies/wp-content/uploads/sites/267/2015/11/STE7.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The linguist [[Sarah Thomason]], critiquing these cases, wrote that Stevenson is "unsophisticated about language" and that the cases are unconvincing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah Thomason]]. (1984). ''Do You Remember Your Previous Life’s Language in Your Present Incarnation?''. American Speech 59: 340-350.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah Thomason]]. (1986-87). ''Past Tongues Remembered?''. Skeptical Inquirer 11: 367-75.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomason concluded, "the linguistic evidence is too weak to provide support for the claims of [[xenoglossy]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah Thomason]]. [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~thomason/papers/xenogl.pdf ''Xenoglossy''] in [[Gordon Stein]]. (1996). ''The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|1-57392-021-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; William J. Samarin, a linguist from the [[University of Toronto]], wrote that Stevenson corresponded with linguists in a selective and unprofessional manner. He said that Stevenson corresponded with one linguist in a period of six years "without raising any discussion about the kinds of thing that linguists would need to know."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1976|title=Xenoglossy: A Review and Report of a Case by Ian Stevenson|url=|journal=[[Language (journal)|Language]]|volume=52|issue=1|pages=270–274|doi=10.2307/413229|last1=Samarin|first1=William J}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another linguist, William Frawley, wrote, "Stevenson does not consider enough linguistic evidence in these cases to warrant his metaphysics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1985|title=Unlearned Language: New Studies in Xenoglossy by Ian Stevenson|url=|journal=[[Language (journal)|Language]]|volume=61|issue=3|page=739|doi=10.2307/414443|last1=Frawley|first1=William}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement, death and experiment==
[[File:Jim Tucker.jpg|thumb|180px|Child psychiatrist [[Jim B. Tucker|Jim Tucker]] continues Stevenson's work.&lt;ref name=staff/&gt;]]
Stevenson stepped down as director of the Division of Perceptual Studies in 2002, although he continued to work as Research Professor of Psychiatry.&lt;ref name=divisionhistory/&gt; [[Bruce Greyson]], editor of the ''[[Journal of Near-Death Studies]]'', became director of the division. [[Jim B. Tucker|Jim Tucker]], the department's associate professor of psychiatry and neurobehavioral sciences, continued Stevenson's research with children, examined in Tucker's book, ''[[Life Before Life|Life Before Life: A Scientific Investigation of Children's Memories of Previous Lives]]'' (2005).&lt;ref name=staff&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/personalitystudies/staff.cfm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021223121523/http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/personalitystudies/staff.cfm |archive-date=December 23, 2002 |title="Division Staff" |dead-url=yes |access-date=September 1, 2016 |df= }}, Division of Perceptual Studies, University of Virginia.&lt;/ref&gt; Stevenson died of pneumonia in February 2007 at his retirement home in Charlottesville, Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;Shroder2007&lt;/ref&gt; In his will he [[endowed]] the Stevenson Chair in the Philosophy and History of Science including Medicine, at [[McGill University Department of Social Studies of Medicine]]. The inaugural chairholder is Professor [[Annmarie Adams]].

As one experiment to test for personal survival of bodily death, in the 1960s Stevenson set a combination lock using a secret word or phrase and placed it in a filing cabinet in the department, telling his colleagues he would try to pass the code to them after his death. Emily Williams Kelly told ''The New York Times'': "Presumably, if someone had a vivid dream about him, in which there seemed to be a word or a phrase that kept being repeated—I don't quite know how it would work—if it seemed promising enough, we would try to open it using the combination suggested." [[The Morning News (online magazine)|The Morning News]] reported in October 2014 that the lock was still unopened.&lt;ref&gt;https://themorningnews.org/article/the-combination-lock-test&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;

'''Iatromathematicians''' (from Greek ἰατρική "medicine" and μαθηματικά "mathematics") were a school of physicians in 17th-century Italy who tried to apply the laws of [[mathematics]] and [[mechanics]] in order to understand the functioning of the human body. They were also keen students of [[anatomy]]. These iantromathematicians made an effort to prove that applying a purely mechanical conception to the study of the human body is futile. The mechanical conceptions that they had referred to was [[Leonardo da Vinci]]’s studies of the human body, and the writings of  Aristotle about the motion of animals related to geometric analysis. Iantromathematicians considered the bodies functioning to be measured by quantifiable numbers, weights, and measures.

==Iatromathematics==
The field of iatromathematics is allied to science; however, it lacks the applicability of the proper scientific method and is therefore considered a form of [[pseudoscience]]. It applies the study of [[astrology]] to medicine.

Iatromathematicians viewed the human body through astrological reasoning as well as mechanics. They associate various stars, or zodiac signs with the functioning of the human body. The twelve astrological signs contribute to each part of the body from head to toe. Moreover, planets and existing cosmos in space are correlated with certain parts of the body. Through examining a [[natal chart]], iatromathematicians attempt to predict biological setbacks in an individual.

Iatromathematicians examine the active and energetic temperament of the human body. Moreover, they explore the causes of various health problems and attempt to find ways to treat certain detrimental diseases. In iatromathematics, there is a particular assumption that there is an impact of various energetic fields caused on the star bodies. The star body of an individual is often referred to by astrologists as an energetic matrix and is believed to be spawned by heavenly bodies such as the sun, moon, planets, and several other astrological signs.

Iatromathematicians study these conceptions and try to regulate the path of the star body of individuals so that it will give a positive, rather than a negative result. By doing so, they believe that it will contribute to a healthier lifestyle. Its doctrine is based on [[cosmobiology]] in which several emotional and physiological dilemmas in the body are associated with the positioning of celestial bodies in outer space.

Iatromathematics is closely correlated with [[biomechanics]] because the field of biomechanics investigates macrobiotic bodies to a macroscopic degree through the appliance of several engineering principles. The perspective of iatromathematicians differed from that of iatrophysicists and iatrochemists in terms of the way human bodies function. Iatrophysicists predicted the deviations from the biological norm of the body through the appliance of physics, while iatrochemists measured the detrimental problems of the body by chemical means.

==Ibn Ezra==

Several individuals contributed to this field study of iatromathematics. For example, [[Abraham ibn Ezra|Ibn Ezra]] (Rabbi Avraham Ben Meir Ibn Ezra) wrote nine different astrological treatises. He covered all the subsections of astrology which include the branches of natal, medicinal, horary, electional, and mundane. Ibn Ezra’s best known work was known as ''The Beginning of Wisdom''. Over time, various individuals studied his works comprehensively. One such person was [[George Sarton]], who is the founder of the [[History of Science Society]].

Recently, [[Archibald Pitcairne]] was mentioned as the "forgotten father of mathematical medicine" and his contribution praised to creating the bases of iatromathematics.&lt;ref name=pitc-lancet&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ashrafian|first=Hutan|title=Mathematics in medicine: the 300-year legacy of iatromathematics|journal=Lancet|date=November 30, 2013|volume=382|page=1780|url=http://download.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS014067361362543X.pdf|accessdate=7 February 2014|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(13)62542-8|pmid=24290588}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pitcairne&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guerrini|first=Anita|title=Archibald Pitcairne and Newtonian Medicine|journal=Medical History|year=1987|volume=31|pages=70–83|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1139685/pdf/medhist00068-0074.pdf|accessdate=7 February 2014|pmc=1139685|pmid=3543564|issue=1|doi=10.1017/s0025727300046329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stevens's typology ==
=== Overview ===
Stevens proposed his typology in a 1946 ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' article titled "On the theory of scales of measurement".&lt;ref name="Stevens 1946"/&gt; In that article, Stevens claimed that all [[measurement]] in science was conducted using four different types of scales that he called "nominal," "ordinal," "interval," and "ratio," unifying both "[[Qualitative property|qualitative]]" (which are described by his "nominal" type) and "[[Quantitative property|quantitative]]" (to a different degree, all the rest of his scales). The concept of scale types later received the mathematical rigour that it lacked at its inception with the work of mathematical psychologists Theodore Alper (1985, 1987), Louis Narens (1981a, b), and [[R. Duncan Luce]] (1986, 1987, 2001). As Luce (1997, p.&amp;nbsp;395) wrote:
{{quote|S. S. Stevens (1946, 1951, 1975) claimed that what counted was having an interval or ratio scale. Subsequent research has given meaning to this assertion, but given his attempts to invoke scale type ideas it is doubtful if he understood it himself&amp;nbsp;... no measurement theorist I know accepts Stevens's broad definition of measurement&amp;nbsp;... in our view, the only sensible meaning for 'rule' is empirically testable laws about the attribute.}}

==== Comparison ====
To give a better overview the values in 'Mathematical Operators', 'Advanced operations' and 'Central tendency' are only the ones this level of measurement introduces. The complete list includes the values of previous levels. This is inverted for the 'Measure property'.

=== Nominal level ===
The nominal type differentiates between items or subjects based only on their names or (meta-)categories and other qualitative classifications they belong to; thus dichotomous data involves the [[Constructivist epistemology|construction of classifications]] as well as the classification of items. Discovery of an exception to a classification can be viewed as progress. Numbers may be used to represent the variables but the numbers do not have numerical value or relationship:  for example, a [[globally unique identifier]].

Examples of these classifications include gender, nationality, ethnicity, language, genre, style, biological species, and form.&lt;ref&gt;Nominal measures are based on sets and  depend on categories, a la Aristotle: {{cite web |url=http://www4.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/gmartin/geog476/Lecture/BeySt.htm |title=Beyond Stevens: A revised approach to measurement for geographic information |first=Nicholas |last=Chrisman |date=March 1995 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Invariably one came up against fundamental physical limits to the accuracy of measurement. ... The art of physical measurement seemed to be a matter of compromise, of choosing between reciprocally related uncertainties. ...  Multiplying together the conjugate pairs of uncertainty limits mentioned, however, I found that they formed invariant products of not one but two distinct kinds. ... The first group of limits were calculable ''a priori'' from a specification of the instrument. The second group could be calculated only ''a posteriori'' from a specification of what was ''done'' with the instrument. ... In the first case each unit [of information] would add one additional ''dimension'' (conceptual category), whereas in the second each unit would add one additional ''atomic fact''.", – pp. 1–4: MacKay, Donald M. (1969), ''Information, Mechanism, and Meaning'', Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, {{ISBN|0-262-63-032-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a university one could also use hall of affiliation as an example. Other concrete examples are 
* in [[grammar]], the [[parts of speech]]: noun, verb, preposition, article, pronoun, etc.
* in politics, [[power projection]]: hard power, soft power, etc.
* in biology, the [[taxonomic rank]]s below domains: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya
* in [[software engineering]], type of [[Trap (computing)|faults]]: specification faults, design faults, and code faults

Nominal scales were often called qualitative scales, and measurements made on qualitative scales were called qualitative data. However, the rise of qualitative research has made this usage confusing. The numbers in nominal measurement are assigned as labels and have no specific numerical value or meaning. No form of arithmetic computation (+,&amp;nbsp;−,&amp;nbsp;×,&amp;nbsp;etc.) may be performed on nominal measures. The nominal level is the lowest measurement level  used from a statistical point of view.

====Mathematical operations====
[[Equality (mathematics)|Equality]] and other operations that can be defined in terms of equality, such as [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] and [[set membership]], are the only [[non-trivial]] [[operation (mathematics)|operation]]s that generically apply to objects of the nominal type.

====Central tendency====
The [[mode (statistics)|mode]], i.e. the ''most common'' item, is allowed as the measure of [[central tendency]] for the nominal type. On the other hand, the [[median]], i.e. the ''middle-ranked'' item, makes no sense for the nominal type of data since ranking is meaningless for the nominal type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manikandan|first1=S.|title=Measures of central tendency: Median and mode|journal=Journal of Pharmacology and Pharmacotherapeutics|date=2011|volume=2|issue=3|pages=214–5|doi=10.4103/0976-500X.83300|pmc=3157145|pmid=21897729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ordinal scale===
{{anchor |Ordinal scale}}&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[IQ classification]] and other articles --&gt;
{{further|Ordinal data}}

The ordinal type allows for [[rank order]] (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) by which data can be sorted, but still does not allow for relative ''degree of difference'' between them. Examples include, on one hand, '''dichotomous''' data with dichotomous (or dichotomized) values such as 'sick' vs. 'healthy' when measuring health, 'guilty' vs. 'not-guilty' when making judgments in courts, 'wrong/false' vs. 'right/true' when measuring [[truth value]], and, on the other hand, '''non-dichotomous''' data consisting of a spectrum of values, such as 'completely agree', 'mostly agree', 'mostly disagree', 'completely disagree' when measuring [[opinion]].

; Central tendency
The [[median]], i.e. ''middle-ranked'', item is allowed as the measure of [[central tendency]]; however, the mean (or average) as the measure of [[central tendency]] is not allowed. The [[mode (statistics)|mode]] is allowed.

In 1946, Stevens observed that psychological measurement, such as measurement of opinions, usually operates on ordinal scales; thus means and standard deviations have no [[Validity (logic)|validity]], but they can be used to get ideas for how to improve [[operationalization]] of variables used in [[questionnaire]]s. Most psychological data collected by [[psychometric]] instruments and tests, measuring [[cognitive]] and other abilities, are ordinal, although some theoreticians have argued they can be treated as interval or ratio scales. However, there is little [[prima facie]] evidence to suggest that such attributes are anything more than ordinal (Cliff, 1996; Cliff &amp; Keats, 2003; Michell, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;*{{Cite book |title=Statistical Theories of Mental Test Scores |last1=Lord |first1=Frederic M. |last2=Novick |first2=Melvin R. |last3=Birnbaum |first3=Allan |year=1968 |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Reading (MA) |lccn=68011394 |laysummary=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1162101 |laydate=24 June 2013 |page=21 |quote=Although, formally speaking, interval measurement can always be obtained by specification, such specification is theoretically meaningful only if it is implied by the theory and model relevant to the measurement procedure. |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Parametric and Nonparametric Statistical Procedures |last=Sheskin |first=David J. |year=2007 |edition=Fourth |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC |location=Boca Raton (FL) |isbn=978-1-58488-814-7 |page=3 |laysummary=http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781584888147 |laydate=27 July 2010 |quote=Although in practice IQ and most other human characteristics measured by psychological tests (such as anxiety, introversion, self esteem, etc.) are treated as interval scales, many researchers would argue that they are more appropriately categorized as ordinal scales.

It is not even appropriate to claim that the 10-point difference between IQ scores of 110 and 100 is the same as the 10-point difference between IQs of 160 and 150 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interval scale===
The interval type allows for the ''degree of difference'' between items, but not the ratio between them. Examples include ''temperature'' with the [[degree Celsius|Celsius scale]], which has two defined points (the freezing and boiling point of water at specific conditions) and then separated into 100 intervals, ''date'' when measured from an arbitrary epoch (such as AD), ''percentage'' such as a percentage return on a [[stock]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Black | first = Ken | chapter = Introduction | title = Business Statistics: Contemporary Decision Making | publisher = Wiley | edition = 6th | date = 2010 | location = Hoboken, NJ | pages = 2–135 | isbn = 0-470-40901-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''location'' in Cartesian coordinates, and ''direction'' measured in degrees from true or magnetic north. Ratios are not meaningful since 20&amp;nbsp;°C cannot be said to be "twice as hot" as 10&amp;nbsp;°C, nor can multiplication/division be carried out between any two dates directly. However, ''ratios of differences'' can be expressed; for example, one difference can be twice another. Interval type variables are sometimes also called "scaled variables", but the formal mathematical term is an [[affine space]] (in this case an [[affine line]]).

====Central tendency and statistical dispersion====
The [[mode (statistics)|mode]], [[median]], and [[arithmetic mean]] are allowed to measure central tendency of interval variables, while measures of statistical dispersion include [[range (statistics)|range]] and [[standard deviation]]. Since one can only divide by ''differences'', one cannot define measures that require some ratios, such as &lt;!--- the studentized range or. --- Error: studentized range is a ratio of a difference (range) to a root-mean-square difference (standard DEVIATION from the mean ---&gt; the [[coefficient of variation]]. More subtly, while one can define [[Moment (mathematics)|moments]] about the origin, only central moments are meaningful, since the choice of origin is arbitrary. One can define [[Standardized_moment|standardized moments]], since ratios of differences are meaningful, but one cannot define the coefficient of variation, since the mean is a moment about the origin, unlike the standard deviation, which is (the square root of) a central moment.

=== Ratio scale ===
The ratio type takes its name from the fact that measurement is the estimation of the ratio between a magnitude of a continuous quantity and a unit magnitude of the same kind (Michell, 1997, 1999). A ratio scale possesses a meaningful (unique and non-arbitrary) zero value.  Most measurement in the physical sciences and engineering is done on ratio scales. Examples include [[mass]], [[length]], [[Time|duration]], [[plane angle]], [[energy]] and [[electric charge]]. In contrast to interval scales, ratios are now meaningful because having a non-arbitrary zero point makes it meaningful to say, for example, that one object has "twice the length."  Very informally, many ratio scales can be described as specifying "how much" of something (i.e. an amount or magnitude) or "how many" (a count). The [[Kelvin]] temperature scale is a ratio scale because it has a unique, non-arbitrary zero point called [[absolute zero]].  &lt;!-- The zero point of the Celsius scale is at 273.15 kelvins, so Celsius is not a ratio scale. --&gt;

; Central tendency and statistical dispersion
The [[geometric mean]] and the [[harmonic mean]] are allowed to measure the central tendency, in addition to the mode, median, and arithmetic mean. The [[studentized range]] and the [[coefficient of variation]] are allowed to measure statistical dispersion. All statistical measures are allowed because all necessary mathematical operations are defined for the ratio scale.

== Debate on Stevens's typology ==
While Stevens's typology is widely adopted, it is still being challenged by other theoreticians, particularly in the cases of the nominal and ordinal types (Michell, 1986).&lt;ref name = "Velleman and Wilkinson 1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Velleman |first1=Paul F. |last2=Wilkinson |first2=Leland |journal=The American Statistician | title=Nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio typologies are misleading |volume=47 | number=1 | year = 1993 |pages=65–72 |doi=10.2307/2684788 |publisher=American Statistical Association | jstor=2684788 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duncan (1986) objected to the use of the word ''measurement'' in relation to the nominal type, but Stevens (1975) said of his own definition of measurement that "the assignment can be any consistent rule. The only rule not allowed would be random assignment, for randomness amounts in effect to a nonrule". However, so-called nominal measurement involves arbitrary assignment, and the "permissible transformation" is any number for any other. This is one of the points made in Lord's (1953) satirical paper ''On the Statistical Treatment of Football Numbers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lord |first1= Frederic M. |journal=American Psychologist |title = On the Statistical Treatment of Football Numbers |volume=8 |number=12 |date=December 1953  | pages=750–751 |doi=10.1037/h0063675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the mean as a measure of the central tendency for the ordinal type is still debatable among those who accept Stevens's typology. Many behavioural scientists use the mean for ordinal data, anyway. This is often justified on the basis that the ordinal type in behavioural science is in fact somewhere between the true ordinal and interval types; although the interval difference between two ordinal ranks is not constant, it is often of the same order of magnitude.

For example, applications of measurement models in educational contexts often indicate that total scores have a fairly linear relationship with measurements across the range of an assessment. Thus, some argue that so long as the unknown interval difference between ordinal scale ranks is not too variable, interval scale statistics such as means can meaningfully be used on ordinal scale variables. Statistical analysis software such as [[SPSS]] requires the user to select the appropriate measurement class for each variable. This ensures that subsequent user errors cannot inadvertently perform meaningless analyses (for example correlation analysis with a variable on a nominal level).

[[L. L. Thurstone]] made progress toward developing a justification for obtaining the interval type, based on the [[law of comparative judgment]]. A common application of the law is the [[analytic hierarchy process]]. Further progress was made by [[Georg Rasch]] (1960), who developed the probabilistic [[Rasch model]] that provides a theoretical basis and justification for obtaining interval-level measurements from counts of observations such as total scores on assessments.

===Other proposed typologies===
Typologies aside from Stevens's typology has been proposed. For instance, [[Frederick Mosteller|Mosteller]] and [[John Tukey|Tukey]] (1977), Nelder (1990)&lt;ref&gt;Nelder, J. A. (1990). The knowledge needed to computerise the analysis and interpretation of statistical information. In ''Expert systems and artificial intelligence: the need for information about data''. Library Association Report, London, March, 23–27.&lt;/ref&gt; described continuous counts, continuous ratios, count ratios, and categorical modes of data. See also Chrisman (1998), van den Berg (1991).&lt;ref&gt;van den Berg, G. (1991). ''Choosing an analysis method''. Leiden: DSWO Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mosteller and Tukey's typology (1977) ====
Mosteller and Tukey&lt;ref name="Mosteller"/&gt; noted that the four levels are not exhaustive and proposed:
# Names
# Grades (ordered labels like beginner, intermediate, advanced)
# Ranks (orders with 1 being the smallest or largest, 2 the next smallest or largest, and so on)
# Counted fractions (bound by 0 and 1)
# Counts (non-negative integers)
# Amounts (non-negative real numbers)
# Balances (any real number)

For example, percentages (a variation on fractions in the Mosteller-Tukey framework) do not fit well into Stevens’s framework: No transformation is fully admissible.&lt;ref name = "Velleman and Wilkinson 1993" /&gt;

==== Chrisman's typology (1998) ====
Nicholas R. Chrisman &lt;ref name="Chrisman"/&gt; introduced an expanded list of levels of measurement to account for various measurements that do not necessarily fit with the traditional notions of levels of measurement. Measurements bound to a range and repeating (like degrees in a circle, clock time, etc.), graded membership categories, and other types of measurement do not fit to Stevens's original work, leading to the introduction of six new levels of measurement, for a total of ten:
# Nominal
# Gradation of membership
# Ordinal
# Interval
# Log-interval
# Extensive ratio
# Cyclical ratio
# Derived ratio
# Counts
# Absolute

While some claim that the extended levels of measurement are rarely used outside of academic geography,&lt;ref name = "Wolman 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Measurement and meaningfulness in conservation science |journal=Conservation Biology |year=2006 |last=Wolman |first=Abel G |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00531.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; graded membership is central to fuzzy set theory, while absolute measurements include probabilities and the plausibility and ignorance in Dempster-Shafer theory. Cyclical ratio measurements include angles and times. Counts appear to be ratio measurements, but the scale is not arbitrary and fractional counts are commonly meaningless. Log-interval measurements are commonly displayed in stock market graphics. All these types of measurements are commonly used outside academic geography, and do not fit well to Stevens' original work.

=== Scale types and Stevens's "operational theory of measurement" ===
The theory of scale types is the intellectual handmaiden to Stevens's "operational theory of measurement", which was to become definitive within psychology and the [[behavioral sciences]],{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} despite Michell's characterization as its being quite at odds with measurement in the natural sciences (Michell, 1999). Essentially, the operational theory of measurement was a reaction to the conclusions of a committee established in 1932 by the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] to investigate the possibility of genuine scientific measurement in the psychological and behavioral sciences. This committee, which became known as the ''Ferguson committee'', published a Final Report (Ferguson, et al., 1940, p.&amp;nbsp;245) in which Stevens's [[sone]] scale (Stevens &amp; Davis, 1938) was an object of criticism:

{{quote | …any law purporting to express a quantitative relation between sensation intensity and stimulus intensity is not merely false but is in fact meaningless unless and until a meaning can be given to the concept of addition as applied to sensation.}}

That is, if Stevens's ''[[sone]]'' scale genuinely measured the intensity of auditory sensations, then evidence for such sensations as being quantitative attributes needed to be produced. The evidence needed was the presence of ''additive structure'' – a concept comprehensively treated by the German mathematician [[Otto Hölder]] (Hölder, 1901). Given that the physicist and measurement theorist [[Norman Robert Campbell]] dominated the Ferguson committee's deliberations, the committee concluded that measurement in the social sciences was impossible due to the lack of [[concatenation (mathematics)|concatenation]] operations. This conclusion was later rendered false by the discovery of the [[theory of conjoint measurement]] by Debreu (1960) and independently by Luce &amp; Tukey (1964). However, Stevens's reaction was not to conduct experiments to test for the presence of additive structure in sensations, but instead to render the conclusions of the Ferguson committee null and void by proposing a new theory of measurement:

{{quote|Paraphrasing N. R. Campbell (Final Report, p.340), we may say that measurement, in the broadest sense, is defined as the assignment of numerals to objects and events according to rules (Stevens, 1946, p.677).}}

Stevens was greatly influenced by the ideas of another Harvard academic, the [[Nobel prize|Nobel laureate]] physicist [[Percy Bridgman]] (1927), whose doctrine of ''operationism'' Stevens used to define measurement. In Stevens's definition, for example, it is the use of a tape measure that defines length (the object of measurement) as being measurable (and so by implication quantitative). Critics of operationism object that it confuses the relations between two objects or events for properties of one of those of objects or events (Hardcastle, 1995; Michell, 1999; Moyer, 1981a,b; Rogers, 1989).

The Canadian measurement theorist [[William Rozeboom]] (1966) was an early and trenchant critic of Stevens's theory of scale types.

==== Same variable may be different scale type depending on context ====
Another issue is that the same variable may be a different scale type depending on how it is measured and on the goals of the analysis. For example, hair color is usually thought of as a nominal variable, since it has no apparent ordering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/mult_pkg/whatstat/nominal_ordinal_interval.htm|title=What is the difference between categorical, ordinal and interval variables?|work=Institute for Digital Research and Education|publisher=University of California, Los Angeles|access-date=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible to order colors (including hair colors) in various ways, including by hue; this is known as [[colorimetry]]. Hue is an interval level variable.

==Spelling==

===Characteristic sequence of letters===
*I always comes before E (but after C, E comes before I)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Great Mnemonics|url=http://www.fun-with-words.com/mnem_example.html|work=Fun-with-words.com|accessdate=29 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kAl&gt;http://www.kidsandlearning.com/mnemonics.html&lt;/ref&gt;
In most words like fr'''ie'''nd, f'''ie'''ld, p'''ie'''ce, p'''ie'''rce, misch'''ie'''f, th'''ie'''f, tier, it is '''"''i''"''' which comes before '''"''e''"'''. But on some words with '''''c''''' just before the pair of '''''e''''' and '''''i''''', like re'''cei'''ve, per'''cei'''ve,  '''"''e''"''' comes before '''"''i''"'''. This can be remembered by the following mnemonic,

:::'''''I''' before '''E''', except after '''C'''''

But this is not always obeyed as in case of w'''ei'''rd and w'''ei'''gh, w'''ei'''ght, h'''ei'''ght, n'''ei'''ghbor etc. and can be remembered by extending that mnemonic as given below

:::'''''I''' before '''E''', except after '''C'''''
:::''Or when sounded "'''''A'''''" as in n'''ei'''ghbor, w'''ei'''gh and w'''ei'''ght''
:::''Or  when sounded like "'''''eye'''''" as in  h'''ei'''ght''
:::''And "w'''ei'''rd" is just '''weird'''''

Another variant, which avoids confusion when the two letters represent different sounds instead of a single sound, as in atheist or being, runs

:::When it says ee
:::Put i before e
:::But not after c

*'''Where ever there is a Q there is a U too'''
Most frequently ''u'' follows ''q''. e.g.: Que, queen, question, quack, quark, quartz, quarry, quit, Pique, torque, maca'''qu'''e, exchequer. Hence the mnemonic:
:::''Where ever there is a '''Q''' there is a '''U''' too''&lt;ref name="kAl"/&gt; (But this is violated by some words; see:[[List of English words containing Q not followed by U]])

===Letters of specific syllables in a word===

*CEMETERY
::There are three "'''e'''"s buried in "c'''e'''m'''e'''t'''e'''ry".

===Distinguishing between similar words===
*Difference between Advice &amp; Advise, Practice &amp; Practise, Licence &amp; License etc.
Advice, Practice, Licence etc. (those with c) are nouns and Advise, Practise, License etc. are verbs.
:::''One way of remembering this is that the word ‘'''n'''oun’ comes before the word ‘'''v'''erb’ in the dictionary; likewise ‘'''c'''’ comes before ‘'''s'''’, so the '''n'''ouns are ‘practi'''c'''e, licen'''c'''e, advi'''c'''e’ and the '''v'''erbs are ‘practi'''s'''e, licen'''s'''e, advi'''s'''e’.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.future-perfect.co.uk/grammartips/grammar-tip-practise-practice.asp Is it practise or practice? - Future Perfect&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians and sociologists have remarked the occurrence, in [[science]], of "[[multiple independent discovery]]". [[Robert K. Merton]] defined such "multiples" as instances in which similar [[Discovery (observation)|discoveries]] are made by scientists working independently of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merton|first1=Robert K.|title=Resistance to the Systematic Study of Multiple Discoveries in Science|journal=European Journal of Sociology|date=December 1963|volume=4|issue=02|pages=237–282|doi=10.1017/S0003975600000801|jstor=23998345}} Reprinted in: {{cite book|author=Robert K. Merton|title=On Social Structure and Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0226520714&amp;id=eprv7hMdO-IC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;lpg=PA305&amp;q=multiples&amp;vq=multiples&amp;dq=Merton+multiples&amp;sig=U774PKmgujti7ktfBM2Z8tm2MDs|date=15 September 1996|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-52070-4|pages=305–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Sometimes," writes Merton, "the discoveries are simultaneous or almost so; sometimes a scientist will make a new discovery which, unknown to him, somebody else has made years before."&lt;ref name="Merton1973"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert K. Merton|title=The Sociology of Science: Theoretical and Empirical Investigations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zPvcHuUMEMwC&amp;pg=PA371&amp;lpg=PA371&amp;focus=viewport&amp;vq=%22Sometimes+the+discoveries+are+simultaneous+or+almost+so%22&amp;dq=merton+%22The+Sociology+of+Science%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Sometimes%20the%20discoveries%20are%20simultaneous%20or%20almost%20so%22&amp;f=false|year=1973|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-52092-6|page=371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly cited examples of multiple independent discovery are the 17th-century independent formulation of [[calculus]] by [[Isaac Newton]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] and others, described by A. Rupert Hall;&lt;ref&gt;A. Rupert Hall, ''Philosophers at War'', New York, Cambridge University Press, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; the 18th-century discovery of [[oxygen]] by [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]], [[Joseph Priestley]], [[Antoine Lavoisier]] and others; and the [[theory of evolution|theory of the evolution]] of [[species]], independently advanced in the 19th century by [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]].

Multiple independent discovery, however, is not limited to only a few historic instances involving giants of scientific research. Merton believed that it is multiple discoveries, rather than unique ones, that represent the ''common'' pattern in science.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert K. Merton]], "Singletons and Multiples in Scientific Discovery: a Chapter in the Sociology of Science", ''[[Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society]]'', 105: 470–86, 1961. Reprinted in [[Robert K. Merton]], ''The Sociology of Science: Theoretical and Empirical Investigations'', Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1973, pp. 343–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Merton contrasted a "multiple" with a "singleton"—a discovery that has been made uniquely by a single scientist or group of scientists working together.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert K. Merton]], ''On Social Structure and Science'', p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinction is drawn between a [[Discovery (observation)|discovery]] and an [[invention]], as discussed for example by [[Logology (science of science)#Discoveries and inventions|Bolesław Prus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''O odkryciach i wynalazkach'' ([[s:On Discoveries and Inventions|On Discoveries and Inventions]]):  A Public Lecture Delivered on 23 March 1873 by Aleksander Głowacki [Bolesław Prus], Passed by the [Russian] Censor (Warsaw, 21 April 1873), Warsaw, Printed by F. Krokoszyńska, 1873, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, since the same phenomenon of [[multiple discovery|multiplicity]] occurs in relation to both discoveries and inventions, this article lists both multiple discoveries and multiple ''inventions''.

* [[Aristarchos of Samos]] (c. 310 – c. 230 BCE) was the first known originator of a [[Solar System|heliocentric (solar) system]].  Such a system was formulated again some 18 centuries later by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (1473–1543).&lt;ref&gt;[[Owen Gingerich]], "Did Copernicus Owe a Debt to Aristarchus?" ''[[Journal for the History of Astronomy]]'', vol. 16, no. 1 (February 1985), pp. 37–42.

* [[Gresham's law|Gresham's (Copernicus') law]]: [[Nicole Oresme]] (c. 1370); [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (1519);&lt;ref&gt;"Copernicus seems to have drawn up some notes [on the displacement of good coin from circulation by debased coin] while he was at [[Olsztyn]] in 1519.  He made them the basis of a report on the matter, written in German, which he presented to the Prussian Diet held in 1522 at [[Grudziądz]]...  He later drew up a revised and enlarged version of his little treatise, this time in Latin, and setting forth a general theory of money, for presentation to the Diet of 1528."  Angus Armitage, ''The World of Copernicus'', 1951, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Gresham]] (16th century); [[Henry Dunning Macleod]] (1857).  Ancient references to the same concept include one in [[Aristophanes]]' comedy ''[[The Frogs]]'' (405 BCE), which compares bad politicians to bad coin (bad politicians and bad coin, respectively, drive good politicians and good coin out of circulation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Αριστοφάνης|title=Βάτραχοι|url=http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/Βάτραχοι#v720|publisher=Βικιθήκη|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[maser]], a precursor to the [[laser]], was described by Russian scientists in 1952, and built independently by scientists at [[Columbia University]] in 1953.  The [[laser]] itself was developed independently by [[Gordon Gould]] at Columbia University and by researchers at [[Bell Labs]], and by the Russian scientist [[Alexander Prokhorov|Aleksandr Prokhorov]].
* [[Kolmogorov complexity]], also known as "Kolmogorov–Chaitin complexity", descriptive complexity, etc., of an object such as a piece of text is a measure of the computational resources needed to specify the object. The concept was independently introduced by [[Ray Solomonoff]], [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] and [[Gregory Chaitin]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;See Chapter 1.6 in the first edition of Li &amp; Vitanyi, ''An Introduction to Kolmogorov Complexity and Its Applications'', who cite Chaitin (1975): "this definition [of Kolmogorov complexity] was independently proposed about 1965 by A.N. Kolmogorov and me ... Both Kolmogorov and I were then unaware of related proposals made in 1960 by Ray Solomonoff."&lt;/ref&gt;
* The concept of [[packet switching]], a communications method in which discrete blocks of data ([[Packet (information technology)|packets]]) are [[routing|routed]] between [[node (networking)|nodes]] over data links, was first explored by [[Paul Baran]] in the early 1960s, and then independently a few years later by [[Donald Davies]].
* The principles of [[atomic layer deposition]], a thin-film growth method that in the 2000s contributed to the continuation of semiconductor-device scaling in accord with [[Moore's law]], were independently discovered in the early 1960s by the Soviet scientists [[Valentin Aleskovsky]] and Stanislav Koltsov and in 1974 by the Finnish inventor [[Tuomo Suntola]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahvenniemi|first=Esko|last2=Akbashev|first2=Andrew R.|last3=Ali|first3=Saima|last4=Bechelany|first4=Mikhael|last5=Berdova|first5=Maria|last6=Boyadjiev|first6=Stefan|last7=Cameron|first7=David C.|last8=Chen|first8=Rong|last9=Chubarov|first9=Mikhail|date=2016-12-16|title=Review Article: Recommended reading list of early publications on atomic layer deposition—Outcome of the "Virtual Project on the History of ALD"|url=http://avs.scitation.org/doi/10.1116/1.4971389|journal=Journal of Vacuum Science &amp; Technology A: Vacuum, Surfaces, and Films|volume=35|issue=1|pages=010801|doi=10.1116/1.4971389|issn=0734-2101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Puurunen|first=Riikka L.|date=2014-12-01|title=A Short History of Atomic Layer Deposition: Tuomo Suntola's Atomic Layer Epitaxy|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cvde.201402012/abstract|journal=Chemical Vapor Deposition|language=en|volume=20|issue=10-11-12|pages=332–344|doi=10.1002/cvde.201402012|issn=1521-3862}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malygin|first=Anatolii A.|last2=Drozd|first2=Victor E.|last3=Malkov|first3=Anatolii A.|last4=Smirnov|first4=Vladimir M.|date=2015-12-01|title=From V.

* [[Capital asset pricing model#Inventors|Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)]] is a popular model in finance for trading off risk versus return.  Three separate authors published it in academic journals and a fourth circulated unpublished papers.
* 1963:  In a major advance in the development of [[plate tectonics theory]], the [[Vine-Matthews-Morley hypothesis]] was independently proposed by [[Lawrence Morley]], and by [[Fred Vine]] and [[Drummond Matthews]], linking [[seafloor spreading]] and the symmetric "zebra pattern" of [[magnetic reversals]] in the [[basalt]] rocks on either side of mid-ocean ridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heirtzler |first=James R. |first2=Xavier |last2=Le Pichon |first3=J.

* [[Cosmic background radiation]] as a signature of the [[Big Bang]] was confirmed by [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]] of [[Bell Labs]].  Penzias and Wilson had been testing a very sensitive microwave detector when they noticed that their equipment was picking up a strange noise that was independent of the orientation (direction) of their instrument.  At first they thought the noise was generated due to pigeon droppings in the detector, but even after they removed the droppings the noise was still detected.  Meanwhile, at nearby [[Princeton University]] two physicists, [[Robert H. Dicke|Robert Dicke]] and [[Jim Peebles]], were working on a suggestion of [[George Gamow]]'s that the early universe had been hot and dense; they believed its hot glow could still be detected but would be so [[red shift|red-shifted]] that it would manifest as microwaves.  When [[Arno Penzias|Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]] learned about this, they realized that they had already detected the red-shifted microwaves and (to the disappointment of Dicke and Peebles) were awarded the 1978 [[Nobel Prize]] in physics.&lt;ref name="Time, Bantam 1996, pp. 43-45" /&gt;
* 1964:  the relativistic model for the [[Higgs mechanism]] was developed by three independent groups:  [[Robert Brout]] and [[François Englert]]; [[Peter Higgs]]; and [[Gerald Guralnik]], [[Carl Richard Hagen]], and [[Tom Kibble]].&lt;ref&gt;Sean Carrol, ''The Particle at the End of the Universe: The Hunt for the Higgs and the Discovery of a New World'', Dutton, 2012, p.228. [http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15744013-the-particle-at-the-end-of-the-universe]&lt;/ref&gt;  Slightly later, in 1965, it was also proposed by Soviet undergraduate students [[Alexander Migdal]] and [[Alexander Markovich Polyakov]].&lt;ref&gt;A.

* The [[affine scaling]] method for solving [[linear programming]] was discovered by Soviet mathematician I.I. Dikin in 1967. It went unnoticed in the West for two decades, until two groups of researchers in the U.S. reinvented it in 1985.
* [[Neutral theory of molecular evolution]] was introduced by a Japanese biologist, [[Motoo Kimura]], in 1968, and independently by two American biologists, [[Jack Lester King]] and [[Thomas H. Jukes|Thomas Hughes Jukes]], in 1969. 
* In 1970, [[Howard Temin]] and [[David Baltimore]] independently discovered [[reverse transcriptase]] enzymes.
* The [[Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm|Knuth–Morris–Pratt]] [[string searching algorithm]] was developed by [[Donald Knuth]] and [[Vaughan Pratt]] and independently by [[J. H. Morris]].
* The [[Cook–Levin theorem]] (also known as "Cook's theorem"), a result in [[computational complexity theory]], was proven independently by [[Stephen Cook]] (1971 in the U.S.) and by [[Leonid Levin]] (1973 in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]). Levin was not aware of Cook's achievement because of communication difficulties between East and West during the [[Cold War]]. The other way round, Levin's work was not widely known in the West until around 1978.&lt;ref&gt;See Garey &amp; Johnson, ''Computers and intractability'', p. 119.&lt;br /&gt;Cf. also the survey article by Trakhtenbrot (see "External Links").&lt;br /&gt;Levin emigrated to the U.S. in 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]], an algorithm suitable for [[digital signature|signing]] and [[encryption]] in [[public-key cryptography]], was publicly described in 1977 by [[Ron Rivest]], [[Adi Shamir]] and [[Leonard Adleman]]. An equivalent system had been described in 1973 in an internal document by [[Clifford Cocks]], a British mathematician working for the UK intelligence agency [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]], but his work was not revealed until 1997 due to its top-secret classification.
* [[Asymptotic freedom]], which states that the [[strong interaction|strong nuclear interaction]] between [[quarks]] decreases with decreasing distance, was discovered in 1973 by [[David Gross]] and [[Frank Wilczek]], and by [[David Politzer]], and was published in the same edition of the journal ''[[Physical Review Letters]]''.&lt;ref&gt;D.

* The [[J/ψ meson]] was independently discovered by a group at the [[Stanford Linear Accelerator Center]], headed by [[Burton Richter]], and by a group at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], headed by [[Samuel Ting]] of [[MIT]]. Both announced their discoveries on November 11, 1974. For their shared discovery, Richter and Ting shared the 1976 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]].
* [[Endorphins]] were discovered independently in Scotland and the US in 1975.
* 1975:  two English biologists, Robin Holliday and John Pugh, and an American biologist, Arthur Riggs, independently suggested that [[methylation]], a chemical modification of [[DNA]] that is heritable and can be induced by [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]al influences, including physical and emotional [[Stress (biology)|stress]]es, has an important part in controlling [[gene expression]].  This concept has become foundational for the field of [[epigenetics]], with its multifarious implications for physical and [[mental health]] and for sociopolitics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Israel Rosenfield]] and [[Edward Ziff]], "[[Epigenetics]]:  The [[Evolution]] Revolution", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXV, no. 10 (7 June 2018), pp. 36,38.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Quantum cryptography]]—the first [[cryptography|cryptographic method]] to rely not on mathematical complexity but on the laws of physics—was first postulated in 1984 by [[Charles H. Bennett (computer scientist)|Charles Bennett]] and [[Gilles Brassard]], working together, and later independently, in 1991, by [[Artur Ekert]].  The earlier scheme has proven the more practical.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Folger]], "The Quantum Hack:  Quantum computers will render today's cryptographic methods obsolete.  What happens then?" ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 314, no. 2 (February 2016), pp. 50, 53.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Comet Levy-Rudenko]] was discovered independently by [[David H. Levy]] on 13 November 1984 and the next evening by [[Michael Rudenko]].  (It was the first of 23 comets discovered by Levy, who is famous as the 1993 co-discoverer of [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9]], the first comet ever observed crashing into a planet, [[Jupiter]].)&lt;ref&gt;[[David H.

* The use of [[elliptic curve]]s in [[cryptography]] ([[Elliptic curve cryptography]]) was suggested independently by [[Neal Koblitz]] and [[Victor S. Miller]] in 1985.
* The [[Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem]], another fundamental result in computational complexity theory, was proven independently by [[Neil Immerman]] and [[Róbert Szelepcsényi]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.eatcs.org/activities/awards/goedel1995.html EATCS on the Gödel Prize 1995] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804131454/https://www.eatcs.org/activities/awards/goedel1995.html |date=2007-08-04 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1989, [[Thomas R. Cech]] (Colorado) and [[Sidney Altman]] (Yale) won the [[Nobel Prize]] in [[chemistry]] for their independent discovery in the 1980s of [[ribozyme]]s{{spaced ndash}}for the "discovery of catalytic properties of RNA"{{spaced ndash}}using different approaches. Catalytic RNA was an unexpected finding, something they were not looking for, and it required rigorous proof that there was no contaminating protein enzyme.
* In 1993, groups led by [[Donald S. Bethune]] at IBM and [[Sumio Iijima]] at NEC independently discovered [[Carbon nanotubes#Single-walled|single-wall]] [[carbon nanotubes]] and methods to produce them using transition-metal catalysts.
* [[Conductive polymers]]: Between 1963 and 1977, doped and oxidized highly conductive polyacetylene derivatives were independently discovered, "lost", and then rediscovered at least four times. The last rediscovery won the 2000 Nobel prize in Chemistry, for the "discovery and development of conductive polymers". This was without reference to the previous discoveries.

A '''science magazine''' is a [[periodical literature|periodical publication]] with news, opinions and reports about [[science]], generally written for a non-[[expert]] audience. In contrast, a periodical publication, usually including primary research and/or reviews, that is written by scientific experts is called a "[[scientific journal]]". Science [[magazine]]s are read by non-scientists and [[scientist]]s who want accessible information on fields outside their [[Academic specialization|specialization]].

Articles in science magazines are sometimes republished or summarized by the [[news|general press]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17259">'''Living educational theory''' ('''LET''') is a research method in educational research.

==Overview==
The idea of [[action research]] as a living practice entered the mainstream of action research from the book, "Action Research as a Living Practice" by Terrance Carson and Dennis Sumara in 1997. Carson and Sumara transformed the concept of traditional action research with the idea that, ..." participation in action research practices are particular ways of living and understanding that require more of the researcher than the "application" of research methods. Rather, action research is a lived practice that requires that the researcher not only investigate the subject at hand but, as well, provide some account of the way in which the investigation both shapes and is shaped by the investigator {{harv|Carson|Sumara|1997| p=xii}}. This requires what [[Martin Buber]] called an "[[I and Thou|I-Thou]]" approach toward other and this approach applied to action research as well. To make Buber's language more modern and accessible, LET translated Buber's "I-Thou" approach toward another human being to an "I/you/we" approach to action research. This differs greatly from an approach to living theory action research imagined by Jack Whitehead (2002){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} where he imagines living theory action research as forming an "I-theory" of knowledge. Director of the [[Philosophy for Children]] Project at [[Notre Dame de Namur University]] William Barry proposes LET focuses on the connections between the researcher and the other person or subject where the lives of action researchers are inextricable linked in a profound manner with the individuals and communities involved in the subject of study. LET from a Barryian perspective is a [[critical theory]] and [[emancipation|emancipatory]] action research approach which seeks the dialectic, not debate and battles of [discourse].

A major difference of William Barry's version of living educational theory, which was the focus of his successful completion of a Ph.D. thesis at [[Nottingham Trent University]], UK, is the essential question behind the living educational theory approach to action research ([[#{{harvid|Barry|2012b}}|2012b]]). The question is not "How can I generate a living legacy for myself through an I-It theory approach toward knowledge and other forms of life?" Rather the essential question is, "How does one conduct a life that includes the practice of educational action research?"{{harv|Carson|Sumara|1997| p=xvii}} The theory/practice problem disappears when honesty about one's biases regarding spiritual, existential, and emotional intelligence are made clear in the action research process.

The phraseology "educational theory" originated with the work of [[Jack Whitehead]], a former lecturer at the [[University of Bath]], and it was further developed and greatly improved methodologically by [[Jean McNiff]] in 2009 because of her willingness to be transparent about her values and intentions. Whitehead's main emphasis for conducting research is to promote the individual under the guise of collaboration and research outcomes must be captured on video for authentic validation. Whitehead's view of action research promotes that living educational theory (he uses living theory and living educational theory interchangeably so it is difficult for a reader to know what he is writing about) should be aimed at the bringing of energy-flowing values as explanatory principles and standards of judgments into the Academy for the legitimation of living educational theories (Whitehead 2008){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}. In the eyes of Whitehead [[radical constructivism]] is at the core of living educational theory research. In 2013, Whitehead and McNiff separated as collaborators as McNiff saw spiritual, emotional intelligence as key to action research while Whitehead disagreed and believed that media accounts (primarily video tapping people) of action research could provide clues to virtues which held the future of humanity though energy flowing examples of collaboration. McNiff stated in a May 2013 conference she San Francisco, California (ARNA Conference){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} that she would never appear or work with Whitehead again. She repeated this message again months later at a UK conference in York. American  William Barry believed the concept of LET was too important and found a dialectic between McNiff and Whitehead and he created a new understanding of LET which was presented at a three-day international conference in 2013 at [[Liverpool Hope University]] titled, "Researching Our Own Practice" {{harv|Barry|2013}}.

== Definition ==

Living educational theory was first clearly defined and developed by California Professor of Philosophy [[William Barry (educator)|William Barry]] (2012b) in [[Liz Atkins]] and [[Susan Wallace (educator)|Susan Wallace]]'s book {{harv|Atkins|Wallace|2012}}, ''Qualitative Research in Education'', co-published by [[Sage Publications|Sage]] and the [[British Educational Research Association]] (BERA). This book was one of four in a series sponsored by the BERA regarding best practice progressive research methods in educational research. The originality and uniqueness of Barry's development of living educational theory (LET) action research is the importance of gaining ''ontological weight'' through the action research process. Ontological weight empowers the researcher's ability, and the ability of other people involved in the action research project, to have the research experience and focus of the research be transformational and add, or at least reinforce, a sense of meaning in learning and life. Barry was influenced to use the concept "ontological weight" by the existentialist Catholic philosopher [[Gabriel Marcel]] (1963).{{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The idea of action research as a living practice entered the mainstream of action research from the book, "Action Research as a Living Practice" by Terrance Carson and Dennis Sumara in 1997. The term "educational theory" originated with the work of [[Jack Whitehead]], a former lecturer at the [[University of Bath]], and it was further developed and greatly improved methodologically by [[Jean McNiff]] in 2009.{{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} Whitehead's main emphasis for conducting research is to promote the individual under the guise of collaboration and research outcomes must be captured on video for authentic validation. Whitehead's view of action research promotes that living educational theory (he uses living theory and living educational theory interchangeably so it is difficult for a reader to know what he is writing about) should be aimed at the bringing of energy-flowing values as explanatory principles and standards of judgments into the Academy for the legitimation of living educational theories (Whitehead 2008){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}. In the eyes of Whitehead, [[radical constructivism]] is at the core of living educational theory research.

Barry was asked by the BERA sponsored authors to reflect on the nature of living educational theory (LET) because there existed no clear definition of LET in the literature. Barry was asked because he had successfully used LET in an innovative fashion, and was the first to clearly define LET as based in [[critical theory]] {{harv|Wink|2011}} which embraced [[transpersonal psychology]] through his earned 2012 PhD thesis at [[Nottingham Trent University]] Nottingham, UK. He proposed LET as a way of challenging the oppressive use of power using critical theory {{harv|Gorlewski|Gorlewski|Portfilio|2012}} in a need fulfilling way (Glasser 1998){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}. Barry proposed the following definition and approach to action research he calls living educational theory and his approach has been used as an action research method in undergraduate and graduate courses and research at [[Notre Dame de Namur University]] in Silicon Valley, California as well as by other researchers around the world.

Barry explained that living educational theory "[is] a critical and transformational approach to action research. It confronts the researcher to challenge the status quo of their educational practice and to answer the question, 'How can I improve that I'm doing?' Researchers who use this approach must be willing to recognize and assume responsibility for being a 'living contradiction' in their professional practice – thinking one way and acting in another. The mission of the LET action researcher is to overcome workplace norms and self – behavior which contradict the researcher's values and beliefs. The vision of the LET researcher is to make an original contribution to knowledge through generating an educational theory proven to improve the learning of people within a social learning space. The standard of judgment for theory validity is evidence of workplace reform, transformational growth of the researcher, and improved learning by the people researcher claimed to have influenced..." {{harv|Atkins|Wallace|2012| p=131}}.

Barry's LET approach to action research was heavily influenced by action researchers focused on emancipatory social change, collaboration, and liberation theology ([[#{{harvid|Barry|2012a}}|2012a]]). Prominent developers of LET, without whose work LET would most likely never had been developed by Barry, are notable action researchers, educators, and philosophers such as [[Martin Buber]]'s ([[#{{harvid|Buber|1970}}|1970]]) conception of 'I and Thou' and [[Krishnamurti]]'s (1953){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} liberation pedagogy emphasizing education as significant to leading a quality filled life; [[Paulo Freire]] (1998{{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and [[#{{harvid|Freire|1970}}|1970]]) and his concept of participatory action research and the need to be politically aware; the work of Carr and Kremmis (1986){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and [[Habermas]] (1992) and their concept and building critical educational knowledge; Professor Manheimer of UNC (1999){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and his challenge to his readers to enfold the past into the living present in order to become historical to oneself and then strive to linking life times with each other; Apple (1982){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and [[Michel Foucault]] (1990){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and the role of power and politics in education and Joe Kincheloe (2008){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}, [[Henry Giroux]] (1997){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}, and [[Peter McLaren]] (1989){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and their promotion of critical pedagogy.

Prof. Barry was the first Ph.D. researcher to successfully use living educational theory in conjunction with [[neuro-linguistic programming]] (NLP), [[spiral dynamics]] and [[autoethnography]] (based on a [[multiple intelligences]] model which includes [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and [[emotional intelligence]] and embraces [[transpersonal]] knowing)  as valid methods of research working under the methodological umbrella of phenomenology and hermeneutics. His LET approach to Ph.D.level action research led to the unique use of fictional storytelling as a vehicle by which to replace the traditional literature review chapter in Ph.D. research but in a more rigorous and creative fashion. The process of [[storytelling]] allows the researcher to exercise their emotional intelligence in a superior manner than the traditional research literature review allows.

==Six cycles==

Living educational theory as defined and created by Barry is part of the curriculum of multiple courses at [[Notre Dame de Namur University]] located in Silicon Valley, California in their credentialing program for teacher education. Barry's Living Educational Theory Action Research Method is based on a six step process&lt;ref&gt;(https://web.archive.org/web/20140310094005/http://www.ntu.edu/faculty-staff)&lt;/ref&gt; based on research questions that normally start from the format, " How can I influence the transformation of....?" or "How can I contribute to the improvement of...?" The research is dialectical in nature:

# I experience a crises in my sense of meaning when my values and beliefs as an educator/educational leader and/or learner are oppressed by my passive acceptance of the status quo and the use of oppressive power to change my identity. In essence, I experience narrative wreckage in my educational life (Thesis).
# I describe my contribution in promoting the [[status quo]] and my role in using oppressive power against others from both a [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] and [[hermeneutical]] perspective to illuminate my living contradictions (Anti-thesis)
# I develop a solution to transform and improve myself, influence the transformation and improvement of the fellow human beings with whom I interact and the social and work places I share with people.
# I enact [[praxis (process)|praxis]] in the direction of the solution I developed from a [[critical theory]] perspective.
# I evaluate the pragmatic outcomes of the solution based on the Hallmarks of Learning {{harv|Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur|2005}} and the implications from a holistic psychological perspective including [[transpersonal psychology]].
# I modify my use of power, pedagogy, valid and reliable [[Educational assessment|assessment]], and leadership to maximize social justice, ethical processes and results, and improve performance and knowledge as a result of my emerging living educational theory (LET) (Synthesis). As an iterative process, I start the cycle again within reasonable time constraints.

[[File:The March of Progress.jpg|250px|thumb|The original '''''March of Progress''''' illustration from ''Early Man'' (1965) with [[spread (typography)|spread]] extended (top) and folded (bottom)]]
'''''The March of Progress''''', properly called '''''The Road to Homo Sapiens''''', is an illustration that presents 25 million years of [[human evolution]]. It was created for the ''Early Man'' volume of the ''[[Life Nature Library]]'', published in 1965.

It has been viewed as a picture of the discredited view ([[orthogenesis]]) that evolution is progressive.&lt;ref name="Tucker2012"/&gt; As such, it has been widely parodied and imitated to create images of progress of other kinds.

The picture of progress in evolution was anticipated by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]]'s 1863 ''[[Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]''.

==Illustration==
The illustration is part of a section of text and images commissioned by [[Time-Life Books]] for the ''Early Man'' volume (1965) of the ''[[Life Nature Library]]'', by [[Francis Clark Howell|F. Clark Howell]].&lt;ref name=Howell1965&gt;Howell, F. Clark and the Editors of TIME-LIFE Books (1965), ''Early Man'', [[New York City|New York]]: [[TIME-LIFE Books]], pp. 41–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The illustration is a [[spread (typography)|foldout]] entitled "The Road to Homo Sapiens". It shows a sequence of figures, drawn by natural history painter and muralist [[Rudolph Zallinger]] (1919–1995).&lt;ref name=Howell1965/&gt; The 15 human evolutionary forebears are lined up as if they were marching in a parade from left to right. The first two sentences of the caption read "What were the stages of man's long march from apelike ancestors to ''sapiens''? Beginning at right and progressing across four more pages are milestones of primate and human evolution as scientists know them today, pieced together from the fragmentary fossil evidence."&lt;ref name=Howell1965/&gt;

===Sequence of species===
The 15 primate figures in Zallinger's image, from left to right, are listed below. The datings follow the original graphic and may no longer reflect current scientific opinion.

* ''[[Pliopithecus]]'', 22–12 million year old "ancestor of the [[gibbon]] line"
* ''[[Proconsul (primate)|Proconsul]]'', 21–9 million year old primate which may or may not have qualified as an ape
* ''[[Dryopithecus]]'', 15–8 million year old fossil ape, the first such found (1856) and probable ancestor of modern apes
* ''[[Oreopithecus]]'', 15–8 million years old
* ''Ramapithecus'',  13–8 million year old ape and possible ancestor of modern [[orangutan]]s (now considered a female ''[[Sivapithecus]]'')
* ''[[Australopithecus]]'', 2–3 million years old; then considered the earliest "certain hominid"
* ''[[Paranthropus]]'', 1.8–0.8 million years old
* Advanced ''Australopithecus'', 1.8–0.7 million year old
* ''[[Homo erectus]]'', 700,000–400,000 years old, then the earliest known member of the genus ''Homo''
* [[Early Homo sapiens|Early ''Homo sapiens'']], 300,000–200,000 years old; from [[Swanscombe Heritage Park|Swanscombe]], [[Steinheim Skull|Steinheim]] and [[Montmaurin]], then considered probably the earliest ''H. sapiens''
* [[Solo Man]], 100,000–50,000 years old; described as an extinct Asian "race" of ''H. sapiens'' (now considered a sub-species of ''H. erectus'')
* [[Rhodesian Man]], 50,000–30,000 years old; described as an extinct African "race" of ''H. sapiens'' (now considered either ''[[Homo rhodesiensis|H. rhodesiensis]]'' or ''[[Homo heidelbergensis|H. heidelbergensis]]'' and dated much earlier)
* [[Neanderthal Man]], 100,000–40,000 years old
* [[European early modern humans|Cro-Magnon Man]], 40,000–5,000 years old
* [[Anatomically modern humans|Modern Man]], 40,000 years to the present

==Intention==
[[File:Astronomy Evolution 2 (27458655072).jpg|thumb|One of many versions of the progressionist [[meme]]: ''Astronomy Evolution 2'' by Giuseppe Donatiello, 2016]]

Contrary to appearances and some complaints, the original 1965 text of "The Road to Homo Sapiens" reveals an understanding of the fact that a linear presentation of a sequence of primate species, all in the direct line of human ancestors, would not be a correct interpretation. For example, the fourth of Zallinger's figures (''Oreopithecus'') is said to be "a likely side branch on man's family tree". Only the next figure (''Ramapithecus'') is described as "now thought by some experts to be the oldest of man's ancestors in a direct line" (something no longer considered likely). That implies that the first four primates are not to be considered actual human ancestors. Likewise, the seventh figure (''Paranthropus'') is said to be "an evolutionary dead end".&lt;ref name=Howell1965/&gt; In addition, the colored stripes, across the top of the figure, which indicate the age and duration of the various lineages clearly imply that there is no evidence of direct continuity between extinct and extant lineages and also, multiple lineages of the figured hominids occurred contemporaneously at several points in the history of the group.

==Reception==
[[File:Evolution on a wall.jpg|thumb|Anti-war mural, Tehran, 2007]]
The image has frequently been copied, modified, and parodied. It has been criticized as  "unintentionally and wrongly" implying that "[[Orthogenesis|evolution is progressive]]".&lt;ref name="Tucker2012"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tucker|first1=Jennifer|title=What our most famous evolutionary cartoon gets wrong|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2012/10/27/what-our-most-famous-evolutionary-cartoon-gets-wrong/drKMD5121W6EUxXJ4pF0YL/story.html|accessdate=29 December 2017|work=The [[Boston Globe]]|date=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to the way the illustration has been interpreted, the anthropologist and author of the section, [[F. Clark Howell]], remarked:&lt;ref name=Barringer2006/&gt;

{{quote|The artist didn't intend to reduce the evolution of man to a linear sequence, but it was read that way by viewers.&amp;nbsp;... The graphic overwhelmed the text. It was so powerful and emotional.&lt;ref name=Barringer2006&gt;Barringer,  David (2006) "Raining on Evolution’s Parade"; ''[[I.D. Magazine]]'', March/April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[Stephen Jay Gould]] (1941–2002) condemned the iconology of the image in several pages of his 1989 book, ''[[Wonderful Life (book)|Wonderful Life]]'', reproducing several advertisements and political cartoons that make use of the illustration to make their various points. In a chapter, "The Iconography of an Expectation", he asserted that&lt;ref name=Gould1989/&gt;
{{quote|The march of progress is ''the'' canonical representation of evolution – the one picture immediately grasped and viscerally understood by all.&amp;nbsp;... The straitjacket of linear advance goes beyond [[iconography]] to the definition of evolution: the word itself becomes a synonym for ''progress''.&amp;nbsp;... [But] life is a copiously branching bush, continually pruned by the grim reaper of extinction, not a [[Orthogenesis|ladder of predictable progress]].&lt;ref name=Gould1989&gt;[[Stephen Jay Gould|Gould, Stephen Jay]] (1989), ''Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History''. [[W.W. Norton &amp; Company]], pp 30–36.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The [[intelligent design]] advocate [[Jonathan Wells (intelligent design advocate)|Jonathan Wells]] wrote in ''[[Icons of Evolution: Science or Myth?]]'' (2002), "Although it is widely used to show that we are just animals, and that our very existence is a mere accident, the ultimate icon goes far beyond the evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wells |first=Jonathan |title=[[Icons of Evolution: Science or Myth?]] |year=2000 |publisher=Regnery Publishing |page=211 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book likens a selection of evolution theory textbook topics to the cover illustration thus qualified.

Brian Switek, writing for ''[[Scientific American]]'', argues that the idea of a "march of progress", as depicted in the 1965 Time-Life illustration, dates back to the medieval [[great chain of being]] and the 19th century idea of the "[[transitional fossil|missing link]]" in the [[fossil record]]. In his view, to understand life and evolution, "step one involves casting out types of imagery which constrain rather than enlighten."&lt;ref name="Switek2010"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Switek |first1=Brian |title=Breaking our link to the 'March of Progress' |url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/breaking-our-link-to-the-march-of-progress/ |publisher=[[Scientific American]] |accessdate=23 May 2018 |date=3 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', Switek added that "There is perhaps no other illustration that is as immediately recognizable as representing evolution, but the tragedy of this is that it conveys a view of life that does not resemble our present understanding of life's history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Switek |first1=Brian |title=The March of Progress has Deep Roots |url=https://www.wired.com/2009/11/the-march-of-progress-has-deep-roots/ |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=23 May 2018 |date=11 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Henry Huxley]]'s frontispiece to his 1863 book ''[[Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]'' was intended simply to compare the skeletons of apes and humans, but its unintentional left-to-right [[Orthogenesis|progressionist]] sequence has according to the historian Jennifer Tucker "become an iconic and instantly recognizable visual shorthand for evolution".&lt;ref name="Tucker2012"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4390">'''Neutron embrittlement''', sometimes more broadly '''radiation embrittlement''', is the [[embrittlement]] of various materials due to the action of [[neutron]]s. This is primarily seen in [[nuclear reactor]]s, where the release of high-energy neutrons causes the long-term degradation of the reactor materials. The embrittlement is caused by the microscopic movement of [[atoms]] that are hit by the neutrons, this same action also gives rise to [[neutron-induced swelling]] causes materials to grow in size, and the [[Wigner effect]] causes energy buildup in certain materials that can lead to sudden releases of [[energy]].

Neutron embrittlement mechanisms include:
* [[Hardening (metallurgy)|Hardening]] and [[Pinning points|dislocation pinning]] due to nanometer features created by irradiation
* Generation of lattice defects in [[Collision cascade|collision cascades]] via the high-energy recoil atoms produced in the process of [[neutron scattering]].
* Diffusion of major defects, which leads to higher amounts of solute diffusion, as well as formation of nanoscale defect-solute cluster complexes, solute clusters, and distinct phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/jom/0107/odette-0107.html|title=Embrittlement of Nuclear Reactor Pressure Vessels|website=www.tms.org|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Embrittlement in Nuclear Reactors ==
Neutron irradiation embrittlement limits the service life of [[Reactor pressure vessel|reactor-pressure vessels]] (RPV) in nuclear power plants due to the degradation of reactor materials. In order to perform at high efficiency and safely contain coolant water at temperatures around 290ºC and pressures of ~7 MPa (for [[Boiling water reactor|boiling water reactors]]) to 14 MPa (for [[Pressurized water reactor|pressurized water reactors]]), the RPV must be heavy-section steel. Due to regulations, RPV failure probabilities must be very low. To achieve sufficient safety, the design of the reactor assumes large cracks and extreme loading conditions. Under such conditions, a probable [[Failure cause|failure mode]] is rapid, catastrophic [[Fracture mechanics|fracture]] if the vessel steel is brittle. Tough RPV base metals that are typically used are A302B, A533B plates, or A508 forgings; these are quenched and tempered, low-alloy steels with primarily tempered bainitic microstructures. Over the past few decades, RPV embrittlement has been addressed by the use of tougher steels with lower trace impurity contents, the decrease of neutron flux that the vessel is subject to, and the elimination of beltline welds. However, embrittlement remains an issue for older reactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Odette|first=G. R.|last2=Lucas|first2=G. E.|date=2001-07-01|title=Embrittlement of nuclear reactor pressure vessels|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11837-001-0081-0|journal=JOM|language=en|volume=53|issue=7|pages=18–22|doi=10.1007/s11837-001-0081-0|issn=1047-4838|bibcode=2001JOM....53g..18O}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pressurized water reactors are more susceptible to embrittlement than boiling water reactors. This is due to PWRs sustaining more neutron impacts. To counteract this, many PWRs have a specific [[Nuclear reactor core|core]] design that reduces the number of neutrons hitting the vessel wall. Moreover, PWR designs must be especially mindful of embrittlement because of pressurized thermal shock, an accident scenario that occurs when cold water enters a pressurized reactor vessel, introducing large [[thermal stress]]. This thermal stress may cause fracture if the reactor vessel is sufficiently brittle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/prv.html|title=Backgrounder on Reactor Pressure Vessel Issues|last=|first=|date=April 8, 2016|website=United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission|access-date=March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Orr's Circle of the Sciences''''' was a scientific encyclopedia of the 1850s, published in London by William Somerville Orr.

The '''post office box''' was a [[Wheatstone bridge]]-style testing device with pegs and spring arms to close electrical circuits and measure properties of the circuit under test.&lt;ref name="MarikaniA."&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marikani|author2=Marikani A.|title=Engineering Physics|url=https://www.books.google.com/books?id=nz-pyJYbtNQC&amp;pg=PA253|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt.

==Resistance measurement==
The boxes were used in the United Kingdom by engineers from the then [[General Post Office]], who were responsible for UK telecommunications to trace electrical faults, i.e. to determine where a break occurred in a cable which could be several miles in length. It works on the principle of Wheatstone bridge to identify the resistance of wire connected and then by using wire resistivity and cross section calculating length of wire and thus determining where the cable had broken.
 
Post office boxes were common pieces of scientific apparatus in the UK [[O-Level]] and [[Advanced Level in the United Kingdom|A-Level]] schools public examination [[physics]] syllabus in the 1960s.

==Construction==
A typical post office box is in a wooden box with a hinged lid and a metal or [[bakelite]] panel showing circuit connections. Coils of wire are wound non-inductively, mounted in the body of the box, and have a negligible temperature co-efficient.

Pairs of ratio arms are each 10, 100, 1000 [[ohm]]s. Resistance arms contains a number of coils from 1 to 5000 ohms with a plug for infinite resistance.

A '''research fellow''' is an academic [[research]] position at a [[university]] or a similar research institution, usually for [[Academic rank|academic staff or faculty members]]. A research fellow may act either as an independent investigator or under the supervision of a principal investigator.

In contrast to a [[research assistant]], the position of research fellow normally requires a [[Doctorate|doctoral degree]], or equivalent work experience for instance in industry and research centers. Some research fellows undertake [[postdoctoral research]] or have some moderate teaching responsibilities. Research fellow positions vary in different countries and academic institutions. In some cases, they are permanent with the possibility of promotion, while in other instances they are temporary.

==United Kingdom==
In many universities this position is a career grade of a ''Research Career Pathway'', following on from a postdoctoral position such as Research Associate, and may be open-ended, subject to normal probation regulations. Within such a path, the next two higher career grades are usually senior research fellow and professorial fellow. Although similar to the position of a research fellow, these two positions are research only posts, with the rise of the career grade there will normally be a formal requirement of a moderate amount of teaching and/or supervision (often at postgraduate level). These positions are for researchers with a proven track record of generating research income to fund themselves and producing high-quality research output that is internationally recognised.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

In some universities, research career grades roughly correspond to the grades of the ''Teaching and Scholarship Career Pathways'' in the following way: research fellow—[[lecturer]], professorial fellow—[[professor]], whereas senior research fellow is somewhere between a [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] and a senior lecturer. However, at some top universities, a senior research fellowship may be a position of comparable academic standing to a full professorship at these universities, without any teaching requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asc.ox.ac.uk/categories-fellowship |title=All Souls College Oxford: Categories of Fellowship|publisher=asc.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, the term research fellow often referred to a junior researcher, who worked on a specific project on a temporary basis. Research fellows tended to be paid either from central university funds or by an outside organisation such as a charity or company, or through an external grant-awarding body such as a research council or a royal society, for example in the [[Royal Society University Research Fellowship]].&lt;ref name=urf&gt;{{cite web|url=https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/grants/university-research/|website=royalsociety.org|title=University Research Fellowship|author=Anon|year=2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203164426/https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/grants/university-research/|archivedate=2016-02-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly in [[Oxbridge]] style colleges, research fellows appointed as [[fellow]]s of a college tended to, or still do, partially receive remuneration in form of college housing and subsistence. Colleges may award junior research fellowships as the equivalent of [[post-doctoral research]] posts, lasting for three or four years. In contrast, senior research fellows tended to be established academics, often a professor on sabbatical from another institution, conducting temporally research elsewhere.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==India==
In India, the position of research fellowship is provided to scholars from various streams like science, arts, literature, agriculture to reward their excellence {{Citation needed|reason=In Indian context they are Research Assistant positions and not Assistant Research fellows. There is a clear difference between the two as mentioned in the beginning of article)|date=August 2018}}. Research fellowship is funded by government academic and research institutes, and private companies as well. Research fellows research under the supervision of experienced faculty, professor, head of department, Dean on two different posts known as junior research fellow(JRF) and senior research fellow(SRF). Research organisations like ICAR, [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research|CSIR]], UGC, ICMR, SERB recruit research fellows through [[National Eligibility Test]]. After the completion of pre-defined tenure, JRF can be considered for senior research fellowship based on research fellow's performance &amp; interview conducted by committee by research institute, research fellow is working with.

==Russian Federation==
In the [[Russian Federation]], the position and title research fellow is unknown; however, there is a broadly similar position of ({{lang-ru|Научный сотрудник|italic=yes}}, literally "scientific worker"). This position normally requires a degree of [[Candidate of Sciences]] approximately corresponding to the PhD. More senior positions normally require, in addition to the aforementioned degree, a track record of publications or certified inventions, as well as practical contributions to major research and development projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==South Africa==
Research fellows in South Africa are considered as the best asset to research organisations and universities. There are highly ranked universities like University of the Witwatersrand, University of Stellenbosch Business School, rhode university which offers fellowship to South Africa's nationals in a certain field of research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usb.ac.za/Pages/Visiting-research-fellowships.aspx "Research Fellowship in South Africa"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recipient of research fellowship==

In some countries, the English term research fellow is sometimes used to refer to the ''holder'' of a ''research fellowship'' that funds research.

In Germany, institutions such as the [[Alexander von Humboldt Foundation]] offer research fellowship for postdoctoral research and refer to the holder as research fellows, while the award holder may formally hold a specific title at his or her home institution (e.g., ''Privatdozent'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avh.de/web/884.html ''Ten Years' Growth - What Fruit Has the Georg Forster Programme Borne?''], Retrieved on 18 Feb 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5819">'''Retrodiction''' (also known as '''postdiction'''—although this should not be confused with the use of the term in criticisms of [[postdiction|parapsychological research]]) is the act of making a "[[prediction]]" about the past.

== Activity ==
[[File:Retrodiction or Postdiction.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of retrodiction or postdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.146.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The activity of '''''retrodiction''''' (or '''''postdiction''''') involves moving backwards in time, step-by-step, in as many stages as are considered necessary, from the present into the speculated past to establish the ultimate cause of a specific event (for instance, in the case of [[reverse engineering]], [[forensics]], etc.).

Given that retrodiction is a process in which "past observations, events and data are used as evidence to infer the process(es) that produced them" and that [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] "involve[s] going from visible effects such as symptoms, signs and the like to their prior causes"&lt;ref&gt;Einhorn &amp; Hogarth (1982),p.24.&lt;/ref&gt; the essential balance between [[prediction]] and retrodiction could be characterized as:
::'''retrodiction : diagnosis :: prediction : prognosis'''&lt;ref&gt;That is, that '''retrodiction''' is to '''diagnosis''' in precisely the same way as '''prediction''' is to '''prognosis'''.&lt;/ref&gt;
regardless of whether the [[prognosis]] is of the course of the disease in the absence of treatment, or of the application of a specific treatment regimen to a specific disorder in a particular patient:
:"We consider diagnostic inference to be based on causal thinking, although in doing diagnosis one has to mentally reverse the time order in which events were thought to have occurred (hence the term "backward inference"). On the other hand, predictions involve forward inference; i.e., one goes forward in time from present causes to future effects. However, it is important to recognize the dependence of forward inference/prediction on backward inference/diagnosis. In particular, it seems likely that success in predicting the future depends to a considerable degree on making sense of the past. Therefore, people are continually engaged in shifting between forward and backward inference in both making and evaluating forecasts. Indeed, this can be eloquently summarized by Kierkegaard's observation that, "Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards".&lt;ref&gt;Einhorn &amp; Hogarth (1982), p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific method==
In scientific method, the terms ''retrodiction'' or ''postdiction'' are used in several senses.

One use refers to the act of evaluating a scientific theory by predicting known rather than new events. For example, a theory in physics that claims to extend or replace the [[standard model]] but that fails to predict the existence of known particles has not met the test of ''postdiction''.

Michael Clive Price has written: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A retrodiction occurs when already gathered data is accounted for by a later theoretical advance in a more convincing fashion. The advantage of a retrodiction over a prediction is that the already gathered data is more likely to be free of experimenter bias. An example of a retrodiction is the [[General relativity#Precession of apsides|perihelion shift of Mercury]] which Newtonian mechanics plus gravity was unable, totally, to account for whilst Einstein's general relativity made short work of it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hedweb.com/manworld.htm#retrodictions The Everett Interpretation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another use refers to a process by which one attempts to test a theory whose predictions are too long-term to be tested by waiting for a future event to occur. Instead, one speculates about uncertain events in the more distant past, and applies the theory to consider how it would have predicted a known event in the less distant past. This is useful in, for example, the fields of [[archaeology]], [[climatology]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[financial analysis]], [[forensic science]], and [[physical cosmology|cosmology]].

==Sensory perception==
In the field of neuroscience, the term ''postdiction'' was introduced by [[David Eagleman]] to describe a perceptual process in which the brain collects information after an event before it retrospectively decides what happened at the time of the event (Eagleman and Sejnowski, 2000&lt;ref name=Eagleman_Sejnowski_2000&gt;{{cite journal | author=Eagleman DM, Sejnowski, TJ | title=Motion integration and postdiction in visual awareness | journal=Science | volume=287 | issue=5460 | pages=2036–8 | year=2000 | pmid=10720334 | doi=10.1126/science.287.5460.2036}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Some perceptual illusions in which the brain mistakenly perceives the location of moving stimuli may involve postdiction. Such illusions include the [[flash lag illusion]]&lt;ref name=Eagleman_Sejnowski_2000 /&gt; and the [[cutaneous rabbit illusion]].&lt;ref name="Goldreich_Tong_2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldreich|first=D|author2=Tong, J |title=Prediction, Postdiction, and Perceptual Length Contraction: A Bayesian Low-Speed Prior Captures the Cutaneous Rabbit and Related Illusions|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|date=10 May 2013|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
One early founder of the STEAM initiative is [[Georgette Yakman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501083822/http://stanleybeamansears.com/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-steam-education/|title=Stanley Beaman &amp; Sears » 5 Things You Need to Know About STEAM Education|date=2013-05-01|access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; who in addition to raising the idea of adding the arts to the STEM acronym, claims to have found a formal way to link the subjects together and correspond them to the global socioeconomic world: "Science and Technology, interpreted through Engineering and the Arts, all based in elements of Mathematics."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yakman|first=Georgette|title=STEAM Education: an overview of creating a model of integrative education|url=https://www.academia.edu/8113795/STEAM_Education_an_overview_of_creating_a_model_of_integrative_education|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She provides professional development training to individual educators and programs on how to use the STEAM framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://steamedu.com/programs/|title=https://steamedu.com/programs/|website=steamedu.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Senator Mark Warner announced Yakman's nomination as NCTC’s STEAM Teacher of the Year 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://steamedu.com/|website=STEAM Education|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Georgette Yakman|url=https://steamedu.academia.edu/GeorgetteYakman|website=Academia.edu|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
*A [[joint resolution]] was introduced  in the [[United States House of Representatives]] expressing the sense that adding art and design into Federal programs that target the STEM fields encourages innovation and economic growth in the United States.&lt;ref name="113HR51"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113hres51ih/pdf/BILLS-113hres51ih.pdf|title=H.

*''Sesame Street''{{'}}s 43rd season continues to focus on STEM, but finds ways to integrate arts. They state: "This helps make learning STEM concepts relevant and enticing to young children by highlighting how artists use STEM knowledge to enhance their art or solve problems. It also provides context for the importance of STEM knowledge in careers in the arts (e.g. musician, painter, sculptor and dancer)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edutopia.org/blog/stem-to-steam-strengthens-economy-john-maeda|title=STEM to STEAM: Art in K-12 Is Key to Building a Strong Economy|last1=Maeda|first1=John|date=|website=Edutopia|publisher=Edutopia|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sesame Workshop"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sesameworkshop.org/season43/about-the-show/curriculum/|title=STEM + A = STEAM: When art meets science, technology, engineering and math|last=|first=|date=|website=Sesameworkshop.org|publisher=Sesame Workshop|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Rhode Island School of Design]] has a STEM to STEAM program and maintains an interactive map that shows global STEAM initiatives. Relevant organizations are able to add themselves to the map. [[John Maeda]], (2008 to 2013 president of Rhode Island School of Design) has been a leader in bringing the initiative to the political forums of educational policy.
* Wolf Trap's Institute of Education, as part of a $1.5 million Department of Education grant, trains and places teaching artists into preschool and kindergarten classrooms. The artists collaborate with the teachers to integrate math and science with the arts.&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/the-movement-to-put-arts-into-stem-education/|title=STEAM Ahead: Merging Arts and Science Education|last1=Chen|first1=Kelly|last2=Cheers|first2=Imani|date=|website=PBS News Hour|publisher=PBS|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[University of Florida]] created an infographic to show the benefits of both STEM (left brain) and STEAM (right brain) functions.{{failed verification|date=September 2017}}&lt;ref name="Sesame Workshop"/&gt;
*The toy lineup of [[MGA Entertainment]]'s [[Project Mc2|Project Mc²]] based on the original series on [[Netflix]] produced by [[AwesomenessTV]], a division of [[DreamWorks Animation]] and the doll lineup such as McKeyla McAlister, Adrienne Attoms, Bryden Bandweth and Camryn Coyle and other toys.

== Other uses of the STEAM Acronym ==
American [[Lisa La Bonte]], CEO of the [[Arab Youth Venture Foundation]] based in the [[United Arab Emirates]], uses the STEAM acronym however her work does not include arts integration. In 2007, she created high profile public STEAM programs in 2007 having added an A for 'inspired STEM', with the A standing for Aeronautics,{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Aviation,{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Astronomy,{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Aerospace,&lt;ref name="BTC_LaBonte_E"&gt;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/migrate/uploads/BTC_LaBonte_E.pdf|title=Microsoft Word - Lisa LaBonte Final to Ann|year=2010|author=Lisa LaBonte|accessdate=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ad Astra!{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} and using all things "air and space"{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} as a hook for youth to embark on greater experimentation, studies, and careers in the region's burgeoning space related industries.

'''Sage Bionetworks''' is a [[nonprofit organization]] in [[Seattle]] that promotes [[open science]] and patient engagement in the research process. It is led by Lara Mangravite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sagebase.org/who-we-are/leadership/|title=Leadership – Sage Bionetworks|website=sagebase.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was co-founded by [[Stephen Friend]] and [[Eric Schadt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year = 2012|title = Profile [[Stephen Friend]]: The Visionary|journal = Science|volume = 335|issue = 6069|pages = 651–653|doi = 10.1126/science.335.6069.651|pmc =|pmid = 22323794|subscription = yes|last1 = Kaiser|first1 = Jocelyn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sagebase.org/info/directors.php |title=Sage Bionetworks Seattle &amp;#124; Directors |work= | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65NAfFu20 | archivedate=2012-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open science==
Sage Bionetworks is notable for being an early advocate of open science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Strauss | first1 = S. | title = Open access consortium | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 298 | year = 2011 | doi = 10.1038/nbt0411-298b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hunter | first1 = J. | last2 = Stephens | first2 = S. | title = Is open innovation the way forward for big pharma? | journal = Nature Reviews Drug Discovery | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 87 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1038/nrd3099}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company operates a software platform for collaborative data analysis called Synapse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.synapse.org/ |title=Sage Synapse |accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that allows researchers to work together on data curation and computational modeling asynchronously in a manner inspired by [[GitHub]]. Synapse also serves as the software infrastructure for running computational challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bio-itworld.com/BioIT_Article.aspx?id=138664 |title=Sage Bionetworks and the Thriving Ecosystem of Challenge-Based Discovery |date=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sage is also developing a citizen-science platform called Bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/pacificnw/2017392286_pacificpsage12.html |title=Seattle's Sage Bionetworks seeks a drug-discovery revolution |first=Maureen |last=O'Hagan |work=Seattle Times |date=11 February 2012 |accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/sage-bionetworks-announces-program-to-develop-bridge-an-it-platform-that-leverages-patient-wisdom-and-data-for-21st-century-biomedical-research-2013-09-27 |title=Sage Bionetworks Announces Program to Develop BRIDGE: An IT Platform That Leverages Patient Wisdom and Data for 21st Century Biomedical Research |date=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The bulk of Sage's scientific results emerge from cancer and neurosciences, with notable contributions to the Cancer Genome Atlas Pan-Cancer project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/ng.2764| pmid = 24071849| title = The Cancer Genome Atlas Pan-Cancer analysis project| journal = Nature Genetics| volume = 45| issue = 10| pages = 1113–20| year = 2013| last1 = Chang | first1 = K. | last2 = Creighton | first2 = C.

==History==
Sage Bionetworks was founded in 2009 as a spinout of [[Merck &amp; Co.]], who released software, hardware, intellectual property, and staff connected to its Rosetta Inpharmatics unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.xconomy.com/seattle/2009/08/06/stephen-friend-leaving-high-powered-merck-gig-lights-the-fire-for-open-source-biology-movement/ |title=Stephen Friend, Leaving High-Powered Merck Gig, Lights Fire for Open Source Biology Movement |first=Luke |last=Timmerman |work=Xconomy |date=6 August 2009 |accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A donation from [[Quintiles]] provided early funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.xconomy.com/seattle/2009/10/06/sage-bionetworks-biologys-open-source-spark-snags-major-donation-from-quintiles/ |title=Sage Bionetworks, Biology’s Open Source Spark, Snags "Major" Donation from Quintiles &amp;#124; Xconomy |first=Luke |last=Timmerman |work=Xconomy |date=5 October 2009 |accessdate=16 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011 Sage partnered with [[CHDI Foundation]] to develop [[computer simulations]] for studying [[Huntington's disease]].  At the same time Sage also announced a partnership with [[Takeda Pharmaceutical Company]] wherein Sage would do research to identify [[biological target]]s for [[central nervous system]] diseases.&lt;ref name="march2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sage Bionetworks Launches International Neurobiology Partnerships |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Sage+Bionetworks+Launches+International+Neurobiology+Partnerships.-a0252728592 |work=Business Wire |date=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, Sage Bionetworks partnered with the Dialogue on Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods (DREAM) project to provide expertise and infrastructure for DREAM Challenges on the [[Synapse.org]] platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xconomy.com/seattle/2013/02/19/sage-bionetworks-absorbs-dream-plans-open-science-challenges/ |title=Sage Bionetworks Absorbs Dream, Plans Open Science ‘Challenges’ |first=Luke |last=Timmerman |work=Xconomy |date=19 February 2013 |accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

two years after the [[United Kingdom]] [[House of Lords]] [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|Select Committee]] on Science and Technology's third report on "Science and Society" in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldselect/ldsctech/38/3810.htm|title=House of Lords - Science and Technology - Third Report|website=www.publications.parliament.uk|access-date=2016-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=July 2016}}

This report stated that while science was generally reported accurately in the mass media, there was a need for the promotion of more expert information at times when science is under attack in the headlines, mentioning the public reaction to GM crops, in particular.

==Functions==
In order to promote more informed science in the media, the Centre's main function is as a service to journalists, providing background briefings on current scientific issues and facilitating interviews with scientists. Its director is [[Fiona Fox (UK press officer)|Fiona Fox]] who is a former member of the [[Revolutionary Communist Party (UK, 1978)|Revolutionary Communist Party]] and a former contributor to its magazine ''[[Living Marxism]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/apr/19/farmingforthefuture | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Clear intentions | first=Peter | last=Melchett | date=19 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
The SMC's stated aim is to "facilitate more scientists to engage with the media, in the hope that the public will have improved access to accurate, evidence-based scientific information about the stories of the day".

==Structure==
The setting up of the Science Media Centre was assisted by [[Susan Greenfield]], the director of the [[Royal Institution of Great Britain]]. While the Centre is still based in a specially refurbished wing of the Royal Institution, full independence is claimed from all funders and supporters.

The Science Media Centre is funded by over 60 organisations, with individual donations capped at £12,500 per annum. The SMC receives sponsorship from a range of funders including media organisations, universities, scientific and learned societies, the [[Research Councils UK|UK Research Councils]], government bodies, [[Quango]]s, charities, private donors and corporate bodies. For an up-to-date list of funders, see [http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/funding.htm].

==Criticism==

A 2013 article in ''Nature'' stated about the SMC, "Perhaps the biggest criticism of Fox and the SMC is that they push science too aggressively — acting more as a PR agency than as a source of accurate science information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/science-media-centre-of-attention-1.13362|title=Science media: Centre of attention|year=2013|author=Nature|doi=10.1038/499142a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[Ronan Bennett]] and [[Alan Rusbridger]] described the SMC as a lobby group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2002/jun/02/gm.observersciencepages|title=Lobby group 'led GM thriller critics'|author=The Guardian|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other SMCs==
During Professor Greenfield's term as [[Thinker in Residence]] in South Australia, a new [[Australian Science Media Centre]] was set up in [[Adelaide]], Australia in August 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Origins|url=http://www.aussmc.org/about-us/our-origins/|publisher=Australian Science Media Centre|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkers.sa.gov.au/thinkers/greenfield/impacts.aspx|title=Adelaide Thinkers in Residence - Impacts|publisher=Govt. of South Australia|accessdate=2011-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science Media Centres now exist in other countries; [[Science Media Centre of Canada|Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], Japan, and Germany. Except for the relation between the Science Media Centre in UK and the Australian Science Media Centre, these centres are independent of each other.

'''Science and technology studies''', or '''science, technology and society''' studies (both abbreviated '''STS''') is the study of how society, politics, and culture affect [[scientific research]] and technological [[innovation]], and how these, in turn, affect [[society]], [[politics]] and [[culture]].

==History==
Like most [[interdisciplinary]] programs, STS emerged from the confluence of a variety of disciplines and disciplinary subfields, all of which had developed an interest—typically, during the 1960s or 1970s—in viewing science and technology as socially embedded enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;Bijker, W. E., Hughes, T. P., Pinch, T. and Douglas, D. G., ''The Social Construction of Technological Systems: New Directions in the Sociology and History of Technology'', [[MIT Press]], Cambridge, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The key disciplinary components of STS took shape independently, beginning in the 1960s, and developed in isolation from each other well into the 1980s, although [[Ludwik Fleck]]'s (1935) monograph ''Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact'' anticipated many of STS's key themes.  In the 1970s [[Elting E. Morison]] founded the STS program at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), which served as a model. By 2011, 111 STS research centres and academic programs were counted worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stswiki.org/index.php?title=Worldwide_directory_of_STS_programs The STS Wiki].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Key themes===

*[[History of technology]], that examines technology in its social and historical context. Starting in the 1960s, some historians questioned [[technological determinism]], a doctrine that can induce public passivity to technologic and scientific "natural" development.  At the same time, some historians began to develop similarly contextual approaches to the [[history of medicine]].
* [[History and philosophy of science]] (1960s). After the publication of [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s well-known ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962), which attributed changes in scientific theories to changes in underlying intellectual [[paradigm]]s, programs were founded at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and elsewhere that brought [[historians of science]] and philosophers together in unified programs.
*[[Technology and society|Science, technology, and society]]. In the mid- to late-1960s, student and faculty social movements in the U.S., UK, and European universities helped to launch a range of new interdisciplinary fields (such as [[women's studies]]) that were seen to address relevant topics that the traditional curriculum ignored. One such development was the rise of "science, technology, and society" programs, which are also—confusingly—known by the STS acronym. Drawn from a variety of disciplines, including [[anthropology]], [[history]], [[political science]], and [[sociology]], scholars in these programs created undergraduate curricula devoted to exploring the issues raised by [[science]] and [[technology]]. Unlike scholars in [[science studies]], history of technology, or the history and philosophy of science, they were and are more likely to see themselves as activists working for change rather than dispassionate, "[[ivory tower]]" researchers{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. As an example of the activist impulse, feminist scholars in this and other emerging STS areas addressed themselves to the exclusion of [[Women in science|women]] from science and engineering.
*Science, engineering, and public [[policy studies]] emerged in the 1970s from the same concerns that motivated the founders of the science, technology, and society movement:  A sense that science and technology were developing in ways that were increasingly at odds with the public's best interests.{{According to whom|date=November 2013}} The science, technology, and society movement tried to humanize those who would make tomorrow's science and technology, but this discipline took a different approach: It would train students with the professional skills needed to become players in science and technology policy. Some programs came to emphasize quantitative methodologies, and most of these were eventually absorbed into [[systems engineering]]. Others emphasized sociological and qualitative approaches, and found that their closest kin could be found among scholars in science, technology, and society departments.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

During the 1970s and 1980s, leading universities in the US, UK, and Europe began drawing these various components together in new, interdisciplinary programs. For example, in the 1970s, Cornell University developed a new program that united science studies and policy-oriented scholars with historians and philosophers of science and technology. Each of these programs developed unique identities due to variation in the components that were drawn together, as well as their location within the various universities. For example, the University of Virginia's STS program united scholars drawn from a variety of fields (with particular strength in the history of technology); however, the program's teaching responsibilities—it is located within an engineering school and teaches ethics to undergraduate engineering students—means that all of its faculty share a strong interest in [[engineering ethics]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===The "turn to technology" (and beyond)===
{{see also|Social construction of technology}}

A decisive moment in the development of STS was the mid-1980s addition of technology studies to the range of interests reflected in science. During that decade, two works appeared ''en seriatim'' that signaled what [[Steve Woolgar]] was to call the "turn to technology": ''Social Shaping of Technology'' (MacKenzie and Wajcman, 1985) and ''The Social Construction of Technological Systems'' (Bijker, Hughes and Pinch, 1987). MacKenzie and [[Judy Wajcman|Wajcman]] primed the pump by publishing a collection of articles attesting to the influence of society on technological design. In a seminal article, [[Trevor Pinch]] and [[Wiebe Bijker]] attached all the legitimacy of the Sociology of Scientific Knowledge to this development by showing how the sociology of technology could proceed along precisely the theoretical and methodological lines established by the sociology of scientific knowledge. This was the intellectual foundation of the field they called the social construction of technology.

The "turn to technology" helped to cement an already growing awareness of underlying unity among the various emerging STS programs. More recently, there has been an associated turn to ecology, nature, and materiality in general, whereby the socio-technical and natural/material co-produce each other. This is especially evident in work in STS analyses of biomedicine (such as [[Carl May]], [[Annemarie Mol]], Nelly Oudshoorn, and Andrew Webster) and ecological interventions (such as [[Bruno Latour]], [[Sheila Jasanoff]], [[Matthias Gross]], [[S. Lochlann Jain]], and Jens Lachmund).

==Professional associations==
The subject has several professional associations.

Founded in 1975, the [[Society for Social Studies of Science]], initially provided scholarly communication facilities, including a journal (''Science, Technology, and Human Values'') and annual meetings that were mainly attended by science studies scholars. The society has since grown into the most important professional association of science and technology studies scholars worldwide. The Society for Social Studies of Science members also include government and industry officials concerned with research and development as well as science and technology policy; scientists and engineers who wish to better understand the social embeddedness of their professional practice; and citizens concerned about the impact of science and technology in their lives. Proposals have been made to add the word "technology" to the association's name, thereby reflecting its stature as the leading STS professional society, {{According to whom|but there seems to be widespread sentiment|date=November 2013}} that the name is long enough as it is.

In [[Europe]], the European Association for the Study of Science and Technology (EASST)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.easst.net/ European Association for the Study of Science and Technology].&lt;/ref&gt;  was founded in 1981 to "stimulate communication, exchange and collaboration in the field of studies of science and technology". Similarly, the [[European Inter-University Association on Society, Science and Technology]] (ESST) researches and studies science and technology in society, in both historical and contemporary perspectives.

In Asia several STS associations exist.
In [[Japan]], the Japanese Society for Science and Technology Studies (JSSTS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://jssts.jp/content/section/14/51/ Japanese Society for Science and Technology Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 2001. The Asia Pacific Science Technology &amp; Society Network (APSTSN)&lt;ref&gt;[http://apstsn.org/ Asia Pacific Science Technology &amp; Society Network]&lt;/ref&gt; primarily has members from Australasia, Southeast and East Asia and Oceania.

In Latin America ESOCITE (Estudios Sociales de la Ciencia y la Tecnología) is the biggest association of Science and Technology studies. The study of STS (CyT in Spanish, CTS in Portuguese) here was shaped by authors like Amílcar Herrera and Jorge Sabato y Oscar Varsavsky in Argentina, José Leite Lopes in Brazil, Miguel Wionczek in Mexico, Francisco Sagasti in Peru, Máximo Halty Carrere in Uruguay and Marcel Roche in Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;Kreimer, P. (2007). Estudios sociales de la ciencia y la tecnología en América Latina: ¿para qué?, ¿ para quién? Redes, 13(26), 55–64. Retrieved from http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/907/90702603.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1958, the [[Society for the History of Technology]] initially attracted members from the history profession who had interests in the contextual history of technology. After the "turn to technology" in the mid-1980s, the society's well-regarded journal (''Technology and Culture'') and its annual meetings began to attract considerable interest from non-historians with technology studies interests.

Less identified with STS, but also of importance to many STS scholars, are the [[History of Science Society]], the [[Philosophy of Science Association]], and the American Association for the History of Medicine.

Additionally, within the US there are significant STS-oriented special interest groups within major disciplinary associations, including the [[American Anthropological Association]], the [[American Political Science Association]], the [[National Women's Studies Association]], and the [[American Sociological Association]].

==Important concepts==
=== STS social construction ===
{{Main|Social construction of technology}}

Social constructions are human created ideas, objects, or events created by a series of choices and interactions.&lt;ref name="Science Technology and Society"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woodhouse|first1=Edward|title=Science Technology and Society|date=2014|publisher=University Readers|location=San Diego|page=255|edition=1st|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These interactions have consequences that change the perception that different groups of people have on these constructs. Some examples of social construction include class, race, money, and citizenship.

The following also alludes to the notion that not everything is set, a circumstance or result could potentially be one way or the other. According to the article "What is Social Construction?" by Laura Flores, "Social construction work is critical of the status quo. Social constructionists about X tend to hold that:
# X need not have existed, or need not be at all as it is. X, or X as it is at present, is not determined by the nature of things; it is not inevitable
Very often they go further, and urge that:
# X is quite as bad as it is.
# We would be much better off if X were done away with, or at least radically transformed." 
In the past, there have been viewpoints that were widely regarded as fact until being called to question due to the introduction of new knowledge. Such viewpoints include the past concept of a correlation between intelligence and the nature of a human's ethnicity or race (X may not be at all as it is).&lt;ref name="The Social Construction of What"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hacking|first1=Ian|title=The Social Construction of What?|date=1999|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard University|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts &amp; London, England|isbn=978-0674004122|page=6|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the evolution and interaction of various social constructions within science and technology can be found in the development of both the high-wheel bicycle, or [[velocipede]], and then of the [[bicycle]].  The velocipede was widely used in the latter half of the 19th century. In the latter half of the 19th century, a social need was first recognized for a more efficient and rapid means of transportation.  Consequently, the velocipede was first developed, which was able to reach higher translational velocities than the smaller non-geared bicycles of the day, by replacing the front wheel with a larger radius wheel. One notable trade-off was a certain decreased stability leading to a greater risk of falling. This trade-off resulted in many riders getting into accidents by losing balance while riding the bicycle or being thrown over the handle bars.

The first "social construction" or progress of the velocipede caused the need for a newer "social construction" to be recognized and developed into a safer bicycle design.  Consequently, the velocipede was then developed into what is now commonly known as the "[[bicycle]]" to fit within society's newer "social construction," the newer standards of higher vehicle safety. Thus the popularity of the modern geared bicycle design came as a response to the first social construction, the original need for greater speed, which had caused the high-wheel bicycle to be designed in the first place.  The popularity of the modern geared bicycle design ultimately ended the widespread use of the velocipede itself, as eventually it was found to best accomplish the social-needs/ social-constructions of both greater speed and of greater safety.&lt;ref name="MIT Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bijker,|first1=Wiebe|title=The Social Construction of Technological System|date=1993|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-262-52137-7|pages=28–45|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technoscience ===
{{Main|Technoscience}}

Technoscience is a subset of Science, Technology, and Society studies that focuses on the inseparable connection between science and technology. It states that fields are linked and grow together, and scientific knowledge requires an infrastructure of technology in order to remain stationary or move forward. Both technological development and scientific discovery drive one another towards more advancement. Technoscience excels at shaping human thought and behavior by opening up new possibilities that gradually or quickly come to be perceived as necessities.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Lukes, Power: A Radical View (London: Macmillan, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technosocial ===
{{split section|Technosocial|date=June 2015}}

"Technological action is a social process."&lt;ref name = "Goldman, 1992"&gt;Goldman, S. (1992). No Innovation Without Representation (pp. 148-160). Troy, New York: Rensselaer.&lt;/ref&gt; Social factors and technology are intertwined so that they are dependent upon each other. This includes the aspect that social, political, and economic factors are inherent in technology and that social structure influences what technologies are pursued. In other words, "technoscientific phenomena combined inextricably with social/political/ economic/psychological phenomena, so 'technology' includes a spectrum of artifacts, techniques, organizations, and systems."&lt;ref name = "Woodhouse, 2013"&gt;Woodhouse, E. (2013). In The Future of Technological Civilization (Revised ed., pp. 1-258).&lt;/ref&gt; Winner expands on this idea by saying "in the late twentieth century technology and society, technology and culture, technology and politics are by no means separate."&lt;ref name = "Winner, 1993"&gt;Winner, L. (1993). Artifacts/Ideas and Political Culture (pp. 283-292). Troy, New York: Rensselaer.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examples====
* Ford Pinto&lt;ref name = "Dowie, 1997"&gt;[https://www.motherjones.com/politics/1977/09/pinto-madness?page=2 Dowie, M. (1977, October 1). Pinto Madness. Retrieved February 4, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; – Ford Motor Company sold and produced the Pinto during the 1970s. A flaw in the automobile design of the rear gas tank caused a fiery explosion upon impact. The exploding fuel tank killed and injured hundreds of people. Internal documents of test results, proved Ford CEO Lee Iacocca and engineers were aware of the flaw. The company decided to ignore improving their technology because of profit-driven motives, strict internal control, and competition from foreign competitors such as Volkswagen. Ford Motor Company conducted a cost-benefit analysis to determine if altering the Ford Pinto model was feasible. An analysis conducted by Ford employees argued against a new design because of increased cost. Employees were also under tight control by the CEO who rushed the Pinto through production lines to increase profits. Ford finally changed after public scrutiny. Safety organizations later influenced this technology by requiring stricter safety standards for motor vehicles.
* DDT/toxins&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; – DDT was a common and highly effective insecticide used during the 1940s until its ban in the early 1970s. It was utilized during World War 2 to combat insect-borne human disease that plagued military members and civilian populations. People and companies soon realized other benefits of DDT for agricultural purposes. Rachel Carson became worried of wide spread use on public health and the environment. Rachel Carson's book ''Silent Spring'' left an imprint on the industry by claiming linkage of DDT to many serious illness such as cancer. Carson's book drew criticism from chemical companies who felt their reputation and business threatened by such claims.. DDT was eventually banned by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) after a long and arduous process of research on the chemical substance. The main cause for the removal of DDT was the public deciding that any benefits outweighed the potential health risk.
* Autopilots/computer aided tasks (CATs)&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; – From a security point of view the effects of making a task more computer driven is in the favor of technological advance because there is less reaction time required and computational error than a human pilot. Due to reduced error and reaction times flights on average, using autopilot, have been shown to be safer. Thus the technology has a direct impact on people by increasing their safety, and society affects the technology because people want to be safer so they are constantly trying to improve the autopilot systems.
* Cell phones&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; – Cell phone technology emerged in the early 1920s after advancements were made in radio technology. Engineers at Bell Laboratories, the research and development division of AT&amp;T discovered that cell towers can transmit and receive signals to and from many directions. The discovery by Bell Labs revolutionized the capabilities and outcomes of cellular technology. Technology only improved once mobile phone users could communicate outside of a designated area. First generation mobile phones were first created and sold by Motorola. Their phone was only intended for use in cars. Second generation mobile phone capabilities continued to improve because of the switch to digital. Phones were faster which enhanced communication capabilities of customers. They were also sleeker and weighed less than bulky first generation technology. Technologically advances boosted customer satisfaction and broadened cell phone companies customer base. Third generation technology changed the way people interact with other. Now customers had access to wifi, texting and other applications. Mobile phones are now entering into the fourth generations.  Cellular and mobile phones revolutionized the way people socialize and communicate in order to establish modern social structure. People have affected the development of this technology by demanding features such as larger screens, touch capabilities, and internet accessibility.
* Internet&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; –  The internet arose because of extensive research on ARPANET between various university, corporations, and ARPA (Advanced Research Project Agency), an agency of the Department of Defense. Scientist theorized a network of computers connected to each other. Computing capabilities contributed to developments and the creation of the modern day computer or laptop. The internet has become a normal part of life and business, to such a degree that the United Nations views it as a basic human right. The internet is becoming larger, one way is that more things are being moved into the digital world due to demand, for example online banking. It has drastically changed the way most people go about daily habits.

===Deliberative democracy===
[[Deliberative democracy]] is a reform of [[representative democracy|representative]] or [[direct democracy|direct]] democracies which mandates discussion and debate of popular topics which affect society.  Deliberative Democracy is a tool for making decisions.  Deliberative democracy can be traced back all the way to [[Aristotle’s writings]]. More recently, the term was coined by Joseph Bessette in his 1980 work ''Deliberative Democracy: The Majority Principle in Republican Government'', where he uses the idea in opposition to the elitist interpretations of the [[United States Constitution]] with emphasis on public discussion.&lt;ref name="Bohman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bohman|first1=James|title=The Coming of Age of Deliberative Democracy|journal=[[The Journal of Political Philosophy]]|date=1998|volume=6|issue=4|pages=400–425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deliberative Democracy can lead to more legitimate, credible, and trustworthy outcomes.  Deliberative Democracy allows for "a wider range of public knowledge," and it has been argued that this can lead to "more socially intelligent and robust" science. One major shortcoming of deliberative democracy is that many models insufficiently ensure critical interaction.&lt;ref name="Chilvers"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chilvers|first1=Jason|title=Deliberating Competence, Theoretical and Practitioners Perspectives on Effective Participatory Appraisal Practice|journal=[[Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values]]|date=March 2008|volume=33|issue=2|url=http://sth.sagepub.com|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ryfe, there are five mechanisms that stand out as critical to the successful design of deliberative democracy:
*Rules of equality, civility, and inclusivity may prompt deliberation even when our first impulse is to avoid it.
*Stories anchor reality by organizing experience and instilling a normative commitment to civic identities and values, and function as a medium for framing discussions.
*Leadership provides important cues to individuals in deliberative settings, and can keep groups on a deliberative track when their members slip into routine and habit.
*Individuals are more likely to sustain deliberative reasoning when they have a stake in the outcomes.
*Apprenticeship teaches citizens to deliberate well. We might do well to imagine education as a form of apprenticeship learning, in which individuals learn to deliberate by doing it in concert with others more skilled in the activity.&lt;ref name="Ryfe"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryfe|first1=David M.|title=Does Deliberative Democracy Work?|journal=[[Annual Review of Political Science]]|date=March 4, 2005|volume=8|pages=63–64|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.8.032904.154633 |url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.polisci.8.032904.154633|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Importance of deliberative democracy in STS====
Recently,{{when|date=January 2018}} there has been a movement towards greater transparency in the fields of policy and technology. Jasanoff comes to the conclusion that there is no longer a question of if there needs to be increased public participation in making decisions about science and technology, but now there needs to be ways to make a more meaningful conversation between the public and those developing the technology.&lt;ref name="Jasanoff"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jasanoff|first1=Sheila|title=Technologies of Humility: Citizen Participation in Governing Science|journal=Minerva|date=2003|volume=41|issue=3|pages=223–244 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1025557512320|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deliberative democracy in practice====
Ackerman and Fishkin offer an example of a reform in their paper "Deliberation Day." The deliberation is to enhance public understanding of popular, complex, and controversial issues, through devices such as Fishkin’s Deliberative Polling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ackerman|first1=Bruce|last2=Fishkin|first2=James S.|title=Deliberation Day|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/media/news/2004/03/10/586/deliberation-day/|website=Center for American Progress|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although implementation of these reforms is unlikely in a large government situation such as the United States Federal Government. However, things similar to this have been implemented in small, local, governments like New England towns and villages. New England town hall meetings are a good example of deliberative democracy in a realistic setting.&lt;ref name="Bohman"/&gt;

An ideal Deliberative Democracy balances the voice and influence of all participants. While the main aim is to reach consensus, a deliberative democracy should encourage the voices of those with opposing viewpoints, concerns due to uncertainties, and questions about assumptions made by other participants. It should take its time and ensure that those participating understand the topics on which they debate. Independent managers of debates should also have substantial grasp of the concepts discussed, but must "[remain] independent and impartial as to the outcomes of the process."&lt;ref name="Chilvers"/&gt;

===Tragedy of the commons===
{{see also|Tragedy of the commons}}

In 1968, [[Garrett Hardin]] popularised the phrase "tragedy of the commons." It is an economic theory where rational people act against the best interest of the group by consuming a common resource. Since then, the tragedy of the commons has been used to symbolize the degradation of the environment whenever many individuals use a common resource. Although Garrett Hardin was not an STS scholar, the concept of tragedy of the commons still applies to science, technology and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hardin|first1=Garrett|title=The Tragedy of the Commons|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/site/feature/misc/webfeat/sotp/pdfs/162-3859-1243.pdf|website=www.sciencemag.org|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a contemporary setting, the Internet acts as an example of the tragedy of the commons through the exploitation of digital resources and private information. Data and internet passwords can be stolen much more easily than physical documents. Virtual spying is almost free compared to the costs of physical spying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davidow|first1=Bill|title=The Tragedy of the Internet Commons|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/05/the-tragedy-of-the-internet-commons/257290/#disqus_thread|website=theatlantic.com|publisher=The Atlantic|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[net neutrality]] can be seen as an example of tragedy of the commons in an STS context. The movement for net neutrality argues that the Internet should not be a resource that is dominated by one particular group, specifically those with more money to spend on Internet access.

A counterexample to the tragedy of the commons is offered by Andrew Kahrl. Privatization can be a way to deal with the tragedy of the commons. However, Kahrl suggests that the privatization of beaches on [[Long Island]], in an attempt to combat overuse of Long Island beaches, made the residents of Long Island more susceptible to flood damage from [[Hurricane Sandy]]. The privatization of these beaches took away from the protection offered by the natural landscape. Tidal lands that offer natural protection were drained and developed. This attempt to combat the tragedy of the commons by privatization was counter-productive. Privatization actually destroyed the public good of natural protection from the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kahn|first1=Matthew E.|title=Environmental and Urban Economics|url=http://greeneconomics.blogspot.com/2012/12/a-counter-example-to-tragedy-of-commons.html|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative modernity===
Alternative [[modernity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eisenstadt|first1=Shmuel|title=Multiple Modernities|journal=Dædalus|date=Winter 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feenberg|first1=Andrew|title=Alternative Modernity : The Technical Turn in Philosophy and Social Theory|date=1995|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520089860}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a conceptual tool conventionally used to represent the state of present western society. Modernity represents the political and social structures of the society, the sum of interpersonal discourse, and ultimately a snapshot of society's direction at a point in time. Unfortunately conventional modernity is incapable of modeling alternative directions for further growth within our society. Also, this concept is ineffective at analyzing similar but unique modern societies such as those found in the diverse cultures of the developing world. Problems can be summarized into two elements: inward failure to analyze growth potentials of a given society, and outward failure to model different cultures and social structures and predict their growth potentials.

Previously, modernity carried a connotation of the current state of being modern, and its evolution through European colonialism. The process of becoming "modern" is believed to occur in a linear, pre-determined way, and is seen by Philip Brey as a way of to interpret and evaluate social and cultural formations. This thought ties in with [[modernization theory]], the thought that societies progress from "pre-modern" to "modern" societies.

Within the field of science and technology, there are two main lenses with which to view modernity. The first is as a way for society to quantify what it wants to move towards. In effect, we can discuss the notion of "alternative modernity" (as described by Andrew Feenberg) and which of these we would like to move towards. Alternatively, modernity can be used to analyze the differences in interactions between cultures and individuals. From this perspective, alternative modernities exist simultaneously, based on differing cultural and societal expectations of how a society (or an individual within society) should function. Because of different types of interactions across different cultures, each culture will have a different modernity.

===Pace of innovation===
{{See also|Pace of innovation}}

Pace of Innovation is the speed at which technological innovation or advancement is occurring, with the most apparent instances being too slow or too rapid. Both these rates of innovation are extreme and therefore have effects on the people that get to use this technology.

===No innovation without representation===
{{POV section|date=August 2016}}
{{main|No innovation without representation}}

"No innovation without representation" is a democratic ideal of ensuring that everyone involved gets a chance to be represented fairly in technological developments.

* [[Langdon Winner]] states that groups and social interests likely to be affected by a particular kind of technological change ought to be represented at an early stage in defining exactly what that technology will be. It is the idea that relevant parties have a say in technological developments and are not left in the dark.&lt;ref&gt;Winner, Langdon. "Artifact/Ideas and Political Culture." Technology and the Future (1993): 283-92. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Spoken about by [[Massimiano Bucchi]]&lt;ref&gt;Bucchi, Massimiano. "No Innovation without Representation (A Parliament of Things for the New Technical Democracies)." http://www.fondazionebassetti.org/. 20 Dec. 2003. Web. 21 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* This ideal does not require the public to become experts on the topics of science and engineering, it only asks that the opinions and ideas be heard before making drastic decisions, as talked about by [[Steven L. Goldman]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Steven L. "No Innovation Without Representation: Technological Action in a Democratic Society." New Worlds, New Technologies, New Issues (1992): 148-60. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privileged positions of business and science===
{{POV section|date=August 2016}}
{{Main|Privileged positions of business and science}}

The privileged positions of business and science refer to the unique authority that persons in these areas hold in economic, political, and technosocial affairs. Businesses have strong decision-making abilities in the function of society, essentially choosing what technological innovations to develop. Scientists and technologists have valuable knowledge, ability to pursue the technological innovations they want. They proceed largely without public scrutiny and as if they had the consent of those potentially affected by their discoveries and creations.

===Legacy thinking===

Legacy thinking is defined as an inherited method of thinking imposed from an external source without objection by the individual, because it is already widely accepted by society.

Legacy thinking can impair the ability to drive technology for the betterment of society by blinding people to innovations that do not fit into their accepted model of how society works.  By accepting ideas without questioning them, people often see all solutions that contradict these accepted ideas as impossible or impractical.  Legacy thinking tends to advantage the wealthy, who have the means to project their ideas on the public.  It may be used by the wealthy as a vehicle to drive technology in their favor rather than for the greater good.
Examining the role of citizen participation and representation in politics provides an excellent example of legacy thinking in society. The belief that one can spend money freely to gain influence has been popularized, leading to public acceptance of corporate [[lobbying]]. As a result, a self-established role in politics has been cemented where the public does not exercise the power ensured to them by the Constitution to the fullest extent. This can become a barrier to political progress as corporations who have the capital to spend have the potential to wield great influence over policy.&lt;ref&gt;Allison, Bill, and Sarah Harkins. "Fixed Fortunes: Biggest Corporate Political Interests Spend Billions, Get Trillions." Sunlight Foundation Blog. Sunlight Foundation, 17 Nov. 2014. Web. 21 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Legacy thinking however keeps the population from acting to change this, despite polls from Harris Interactive that report over 80% of Americans feel that big business holds too much power in government.&lt;ref&gt;Corso, Regina, SVP. "PACs, Big Companies, Lobbyists, and Banks and Financial Institutions Seen by Strong Majorities as Having Too Much Power and Influence in DC." Harris Interactive: Harris Polls. Harris Interactive, 29 May 2012. Web. 21 Apr. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Americans are beginning to try to steer away this line of thought, rejecting legacy thinking, and demanding less corporate, and more public, participation in political decision making.

Additionally, an examination of [[net neutrality]] functions as a separate example of legacy thinking. Starting with [[dial-up]], the internet has always been viewed as a private luxury good.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Internet today is a vital part of modern-day society members. They use it in and out of life every day.&lt;ref name="Net Neutrality 2015"&gt;"Net Neutrality: A Free and Open Internet." The White House. The White House, 26 Feb. 2015. Web. 21 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations are able to mislabel and greatly overcharge for their internet resources. Since the American public is so dependent upon internet there is little for them to do. Legacy thinking has kept this pattern on track despite growing movements arguing that the internet should be considered a &lt;!--which kind? - human right/..?--&gt;utility. Legacy thinking prevents progress because it was widely accepted by others before us through advertising that the internet is a luxury and not a &lt;!--basic?--&gt;utility. Due to pressure from grassroots movements the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) has redefined the requirements for broadband and internet in general as a utility.&lt;ref name="Net Neutrality 2015"/&gt; Now AT&amp;T and other major internet providers are lobbying against this action and are in-large able to delay the onset of this movement due to legacy thinking’s grip on American&lt;!--this article &amp; legacy thinking relates to the global population not just the American--&gt; culture and politics.

For example, those who cannot overcome the barrier of legacy thinking may not consider the [[water privatization|privatization of clean drinking water]] as an issue.&lt;ref&gt;Flow. Oscilloscope Pictures, 2008. DVD.&lt;/ref&gt; This is partially because access to water has become such a given fact of the matter to them. For a person living in such circumstances, it may be widely accepted to not concern themselves with drinking water because they have not needed to be concerned with it in the past. Additionally, a person living within an area that does not need to worry about their water supply or the sanitation of their water supply is less likely to be concerned with the privatization of water.

This notion can be examined through the thought experiment of "[[veil of ignorance]]".&lt;ref&gt;Woodhouse, Edward. Science Technology and Society. Spring 2015 ed. N.p.: U Readers, 2014. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Legacy thinking causes people to be particularly ignorant about the implications behind the "you get what you pay for" mentality applied to a life necessity. By utilizing the "veil of ignorance", one can overcome the barrier of legacy thinking as it requires a person to imagine that they are unaware of their own circumstances, allowing them to free themselves from externally imposed thoughts or widely accepted ideas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35327">'''Source criticism''' (or '''information evaluation''') is the process of evaluating an [[information source]], i.e. a document, a person, a speech, a fingerprint, a photo, an observation, or anything used in order to obtain knowledge. In relation to a given purpose, a given information source may be more or less valid,  reliable or relevant. Broadly, "source criticism" is the interdisciplinary study of how information sources are evaluated for given tasks.

== Meaning ==

Problems in translation: The Danish word "kildekritik" like the Norwegian word "kildekritikk" and the Swedish word "källkritik" derived from the German "Quellenkritik" and is closely associated with the German historian [[Leopold von Ranke]] (1795&amp;ndash;1886). Hardtwig writes: "His [Ranke's] first work ''Geschichte der romanischen und germanischen Völker'' von 1494&amp;ndash;1514 (History of the Latin and Teutonic Nations from 1494 to 1514) (1824) was a great success. It already showed some of the basic characteristics of his conception of Europe, and was of historiographical importance particularly because Ranke made an exemplary critical analysis of his sources in a separate volume, ''Zur Kritik neuerer Geschichtsschreiber'' (On the Critical Methods of Recent Historians). In this work he raised the method of [[textual criticism]] used in the late eighteenth century, particularly in classical philology to the standard method of scientific historical writing" (Hardtwig, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;12739).

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The larger part of the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries would be dominated by the research-oriented
conception of historical method of the so-called
Historical School in Germany, led by historians as
Leopold Ranke and Berthold Niebuhr. Their conception
of history, long been regarded as the beginning
of modern, 'scientific' history, harked back to the
'narrow' conception of historical method, limiting the
methodical character of history to source criticism" (Lorenz, 2001).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bible studies dominate the use of "source criticism" in America (cf. Hjørland, 2008). The term is thus relatively seldom used in English about [[historical method]]s and [[historiography]] (cf. Hjørland, 2008). This difference between European and American use of "source criticism" is somewhat strange considering the influence of Ranke on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. It has been suggested that differences in the use of the term are not accidental but due to different views of the historical method.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In the German/Scandinavian tradition this subject is seen as important, whereas in the Anglo-American tradition it is believed that historical methods must be specific and associated with the subject studied, for which reason there is no general field of "source criticism"{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}.

In the Scandinavian countries and elsewhere source evaluation (or information evaluation) is also studied interdisciplinarily from many different points of view, partly caused by the influence of the Internet. It is a growing field in, among other fields, [[library and information science]]. In this context source criticism is studied from a broader perspective than just, for example, history or biblical studies.&lt;ref&gt;Hjørland, Birger (2012). Methods for evaluating information sources: An annotated catalogue. Journal of information science. 38(3), 258-268.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Balin, A. &amp; Grafstein, A. (2010). The critical assessment of research: Traditional and new methods of evaluation. Oxford: Chandos Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
The following principles are cited from two Scandinavian textbooks on source criticism, Olden-Jørgensen (1998) and Thurén (1997) written by historians:
* Human sources may be relics (e.g. a fingerprint) or narratives (e.g. a statement or a letter). Relics are more credible sources than narratives.
*  A given source may be forged or corrupted; strong indications of the originality of the source increases its reliability.
*  The closer a source is to the event which it purports to describe, the more one can trust it to give an accurate description of what really happened
* A [[primary source]] is more reliable than a [[secondary source]], which in turn is more reliable than a [[tertiary source]] and so on.
*  If a number of ''independent'' sources contain the same message, the credibility of the message is strongly increased.
* The tendency of a source is its motivation for providing some kind of bias. Tendencies should be minimized or supplemented with opposite motivations.
*  If it can be demonstrated that the witness (or source) has no direct interest in creating bias, the credibility of the message is increased.

We may add the following principles:
* Knowledge of source criticism cannot substitute subject knowledge:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Because each source teaches you more and more about your subject, you will be able to judge with ever-increasing precision the usefulness and value of any prospective source. In other words, the more you know about the subject, the more precisely you can identify what you must still find out". (Bazerman, 1995, p. 304).

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* The reliability of a given source is relative to the questions put to it.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The empirical case study showed that most people find it difficult to assess questions of cognitive authority and media credibility in a general sense, for example, by comparing the overall credibility of newspapers and the Internet. Thus these assessments tend to be situationally sensitive. Newspapers, television and the Internet were frequently used as sources of orienting information, but their credibility varied depending on the actual topic at hand" (Savolainen, 2007).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following questions are often good ones to ask about any source according to the American Library Association (1994) and Engeldinger (1988):

#How was the source located?
#What type of source is it?
#Who is the author and what are the qualifications of the author in regard to the topic that is discussed?
#When was the information published?
#In which country was it published?
#What is the reputation of the publisher?
#Does the source show a particular cultural or political bias?

For literary sources we might add complementing criteria:

#Does the source contain a bibliography?
#Has the material been reviewed by a group of peers, or has it been edited?
#How does the article/book compare with similar articles/books?

==Levels of generality==
How general are principles of source criticism?
Some principles are universal, other principles are specific for certain kinds of information sources. One may ask whether principles of source criticism are unique to the humanities?

There is today no consensus about the similarities and differences between natural science and humanities. [[Logical positivism]] claimed that all fields of knowledge were based on the same principles. Much of the criticism of logical positivism claimed that positivism is the basis of the sciences, whereas [[hermeneutics]] is the basis of the humanities. This was, for example, the position of [[Jürgen Habermas]]. A newer position, in accordance with, among others, [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] and [[Thomas Kuhn]] understands both science and humanities as determined by researchers' preunderstanding and paradigms. Hermeneutics is thus a universal theory.  The difference is, however, that the sources of the humanities are themselves products of human interests and preunderstanding, whereas the sources of the natural sciences are not. Humanities are thus "doubly hermeneutic".

Natural scientists, however, are also using human products (such as scientific papers) which are products of preunderstanding (and, for example, [[academic fraud]]).

==Contributing fields==

===Epistemology===
Epistemological theories are the basic theories about how knowledge is obtained and thus the most general theories about how to evaluate information sources. [[Empiricism]] evaluates sources by considering the observations (or sensations) on which they are based. Sources without basis in experience are not seen as valid. [[Rationalism]] provides low priority to sources based on observations. In order to be meaningful observations must be grasped by clear ideas or concepts. It is the logical structure and the well definedness that is in focus in evaluating information sources from the rationalist point of view. [[Historicism]] evaluates information sources on the basis of their reflection of their sociocultural context and their theoretical development. [[Pragmatism]] evaluate sources on the basis of how their values and usefulness to accomplish certain outcomes. Pragmatism is skeptical about claimed neutral information sources.

The evaluation of knowledge or information sources cannot be more certain than is the construction of knowledge. If we accept the principle of [[fallibilism]] we also have to accept that source criticism can never 100% verify knowledge claims. As discussed in the next section is source criticism intimately linked to [[scientific method]]s.

The presence of '''fallacies of argument''' in sources is another kind of philosophical criteria for evaluating sources. Fallacies are presented by Walton (1998). Among the fallacies are the 'ad hominem fallacy' (the use of personal attack to try to undermine or refute a person's argument) and the 'straw man fallacy' (when one arguer misrepresents another's position to make it appear less plausible than it really is, in order more easily to criticize or refute it.) See also [[fallacy]].

===Research methodology===
Research methods are methods used to produce scholarly knowledge. The methods that are relevant for producing knowledge are also relevant for evaluating knowledge. An example of a book that turns methodology upside-down and uses it to evaluate produced knowledge is Katzer; Cook &amp; Crouch (1998). See also [[Unobtrusive measures]], [[Triangulation (social science)]].

===Science studies===
Studies of quality evaluation processes such as [[peer review]], [[book review]]s and of the normative criteria used in evaluation of scientific and scholarly research. Another field is the study of [[scientific misconduct]].

Harris (1979) provides a case study of how a famous experiment in psychology, [[Little Albert]], has been distorted throughout the history of psychology, starting with the author (Watson) himself, general textbook authors, behavior therapists, and a prominent learning theorist. Harris proposes possible causes for these distortions and analyzes the Albert study as an example of myth making in the history of psychology. Studies of this kind may be regarded a special kind of [[reception history]] (how Watson's paper was received).  It may also be regarded as a kind of critical history (opposed to ceremonial history of psychology, cf. Harris, 1980). Such studies are important for source criticism in revealing the bias introduced by referring to classical studies.

===Textual criticism===
Textual criticism (or broader: text philology) is a part of [[philology]], which is not just devoted to the study  of texts, but also to edit and produce "scientific editions", "scholarly editions", "standard editions", "historical editions", "reliable editions", "reliable texts", "text editions"  or "critical editions", which are editions in which careful scholarship has been employed to ensure that the information contained within is as close to the author's/composer's original intentions as possible (and which allows the user to compare and judge changes in editions published under influence by the author/composer). The relation between these kinds of works and the concept "source criticism" is evident in Danish, where they may be termed "kildekritisk udgave" (directly translated "source critical edition").

In other words, it is assumed that most editions of a given works is filled with noise and errors provided by publishers, why it is important to produce "scholarly editions". The work provided by text philology is an important part of source criticism in the humanities.

===Psychology===
The study of [[eyewitness testimony]] is an important field of study used, among other purposes, to evaluate testimony in courts. The basics of eyewitness fallibility includes factors such as poor viewing conditions, brief exposure, and stress. More  subtle factors, such as expectations, biases, and personal stereotypes can intervene to create erroneous reports. Loftus (1996) discuss all such factors and also shows that [[eyewitness memory]] is chronically inaccurate in surprising ways. An ingenious series of experiments reveals that memory can be radically altered by the way an eyewitness is questioned after the fact. New memories can be implanted and old ones unconsciously altered under interrogation.

Anderson (1978) and Anderson &amp; Pichert (1977) reported an elegant experiment demonstrating how change in perspective affected people's ability to recall information that was unrecallable from another perspective.

In psychoanalysis  the concept of [[defence mechanism]] is important and may be considered a contribution to the theory of source criticism because it explains psychological mechanisms, which distort the reliability of human information sources.

===Library and information science (LIS)===
In schools of library and information science (LIS) is source criticism of taught as part of the growing field [[Information literacy]].
Study issues like [[relevance]], quality indicators for documents, kinds of documents and their qualities (e.g. scholarly editions) and related issues are studied in LIS and are relevant for source criticism. [[Bibliometrics]] is often used to find the most influential journal, authors, countries and institutions. The study of [[book review]]s and their function in evaluating books should also be mentioned. The well-known comparison of Wikipedia and Encyclopædia Britannica (Giles, 2005) - although not done by information scientists - contained an interview with an information scientist (Michael Twidale) and should be obvious to include in LIS.

It could be argued that library and information education should provide teaching in source criticism at least at the same level as is taught in Upper Secondary School  (see Gudmundsson, 2007).

In library and information science the checklist approach has often been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iva.dk/jni/lifeboat/info.asp?subjectid=308 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-10-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210212549/http://www.iva.dk/jni/lifeboat/info.asp?subjectid=308 |archive-date=2013-02-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A criticism of this approach is given by Meola (2004): "Chucking the checklist".

Libraries sometimes provide advice on how their users may evaluate sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bib.slu.se/kurser/sss/samla/kallkritik/ekallkritik.html General Source Criticism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304184332/http://www.bib.slu.se/kurser/sss/samla/kallkritik/ekallkritik.html |date=2007-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bib.slu.se/kurser/sss/samla/vardering/evarref.html Topicality and Reliability of Printed Documents] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215004102/http://www.bib.slu.se/kurser/sss/samla/vardering/evarref.html |date=2008-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Library of Congress has a "Teaching with Primary Sources" (TPS) program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/teachers/tps/about/|title=About the Program- Teaching with Primary Sources - Teacher Resources - Library of Congress|author=|date=|website=www.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===
Source criticism is also about ethical behavior and culture. It is about a free press and an open society, including the  protecting information sources from being persecuted (cf., [[Whistleblower]]).

==In specific domains==

===Photos===


{{See also|Photo manipulation}}

Photos are often manipulated during wars and for political purposes. One well known example is Joseph Stalin's manipulation of a photograph from May 5, 1920 on which Stalin's predecessor Lenin held a speech for Soviet troops that Leon Trotsky attended. Stalin had later Trotsky retouched out of this photograph. (cf. King, 1997). A recent example is reported by Healy (2008) about North Korean leader [[Kim Jong Il]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/07/was-the-dear-leader-photoshopped-in/?scp=7&amp;sq=Kim%20Jong-il&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=Was the Dear Leader Photoshopped In? | first=Jack | last=Healy | date=2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet sources===


{{See also|E-mail fraud|Internet fraud}}

Much interest in evaluating Internet sources (such as [[Wikipedia]]) is reflected in the scholarly literature of [[Library and information science]] and in other fields. Mintz (2002) is an edited volume about this issue. Examples of literature examining Internet sources include Chesney (2006), Fritch &amp; Cromwell (2001), Leth &amp; Thurén (2000) and Wilkinson, Bennett, &amp; Oliver (1997).

=== Archaeology and history ===
"In history, the term historical method was first introduced in a systematic way in the sixteenth century by Jean Bodin in his treatise of source criticism, ''Methodus ad facilem historiarium cognitionem'' (1566). Characteristically, Bodin's treatise intended to establish the ways by which reliable knowledge of the past could be established by checking sources against one another and by so assessing the reliability of the information conveyed by them, relating them to the interests involved." (Lorenz, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;6870).

As written above, modern source criticism in history is closely associated with the German historian [[Leopold von Ranke]] (1795&amp;ndash;1886), who influenced historical methods on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, although in rather different ways. American history developed in a more empirist and antiphilosophical way (cf., Novick, 1988).

Two of the best-known rule books from History's childhood are Bernheim (1889) and Langlois &amp; Seignobos (1898). These books provided a seven-step procedure (here quoted from Howell &amp; Prevenier, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;70-71):
# If the sources all agree about an event, historians can consider the event proved.
# However, majority does not rule; even if most sources relate events in one way, that version will not prevail unless it passes the test of critical textual analysis.
# The source whose account can be confirmed by reference to outside authorities in some of its parts can be trusted in its entirety if it is impossible similarly to confirm the entire text.
# When two sources disagree on a particular point, the historian will prefer the source with most "authority" - - i.e. the source created by the expert or by the eyewitness.
# Eyewittnesses are, in general, to be preferred, especially in circumstances where the ordinary observer could have accurately reported what transpired and, more specifically, when they deal with facts known by most contemporaries.
# If two independently created sources agree on a matter, the reliability of each is measureably enhanced.
# When two sources disagree (and there is no other means of evaluation), then historians take the source which seems to accord best with common sense.

Gudmundsson (2007, p.&amp;nbsp;38) writes:  "Source criticism should not totally dominate later courses. Other important perspectives, for example, philosophy of history/view of history, should not suffer by being neglected" (Translated by BH). This quote makes a distinction between source criticism on the one hand and historical philosophy on the other hand. However, different views of history and different specific theories about the field being studied may have important consequences for how sources are selected, interpreted and used. Feminist scholars may, for example, select sources made by women and may interpret sources from a feminist perspective. Epistemology should thus be considered a part of source criticism. It is in particular related to "tendency analysis".

In [[archaeology]], [[radiocarbon dating]] is an important technique to establish the age of information sources. Methods of this kind were the ideal when history established itself as both a scientific discipline and as a profession based on "scientific" principles in the last part of the 1880s (although radiocarbon dating is a more recent example of such methods). The empiricist movement in history brought along both "source criticism" as a research method and also in many countries large scale publishing efforts to make valid editions of "source materials" such as important letters and official documents (e.g. as [[facsimile]]s or [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]]s).

[[Historiography]] and [[Historical method]] include the study of the reliability of the sources used, in terms of, for example, authorship, credibility of the author, and the authenticity or corruption of the text.

===Biblical studies===
{{Main|Source criticism (biblical studies)}}
Source criticism, as the term is used in [[biblical criticism]], refers to the attempt to establish the sources used by the author and/or redactor of the final text. The term "literary criticism" is occasionally used as a synonym.

Biblical source criticism originated in the 18th century with the work of [[Jean Astruc]], who adapted the methods already developed for investigating the texts of Classical antiquity ([[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]] in particular) to his own investigation into the sources of the [[Book of Genesis]]. It was subsequently considerably developed by German scholars in what was known as "the [[Higher Criticism]]", a term no longer in widespread use. The ultimate aim of these scholars was to reconstruct the history of the biblical text, as well as the religious history of ancient Israel.

Related to Source Criticism is [[Redaction Criticism]] which seeks to determine how and why the redactor (editor) put the sources together the way he did. Also related is [[form criticism]] and [[tradition history]] which try to reconstruct the oral prehistory behind the identified written sources.

===Journalism===

{{See also|Journalism fraud}}

Journalists often work with strong time pressure and have access to only a limited number of [[information source]]s such as [[news bureau]]s, persons which may be interviewed, [[newspaper]]s, [[Academic journal|journals]] and so on (see [[journalism sourcing]]). Journalists' possibility for conducting serious source criticism is thus limited compared to, for example, historians' possibilities.

===Legal studies===

{{See also|Evidence (law)}}

The most important legal sources are created by parliaments, governments, courts, and legal researchers. They may be written or informal and based on established practices. Views concerning the quality of sources differ among legal philosophies: [[Legal positivism]] is the view that the text of the law should be considered in isolation, while [[legal realism]], [[interpretivism (legal)]], [[critical legal studies]] and feminist legal criticism interprets the law on a broader cultural basis.

'''Abstract''':  When classifying the array of interpretive methods currently available, biblical critics regularly distinguish between historical-critical methods, on the one hand, and literary critical methods, on the other. Frequently, methods on one side of the divide are said to be antagonistic to certain methods on the other. This article examines two such presumed antagonistic methods, source criticism and deconstructive criticism, and argues that they are not, in fact, antagonistic, but similar: both are postmodern movements, and both share an interpretive methodology (insofar as it is correct to speak of a deconstructive methodology). This argument is illustrated with a source-critical and a deconstructive reading of Exodus 14.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4674">In [[philosophy of science]], '''strong inference''' is a [[model of scientific inquiry]] that emphasizes the need for [[alternative hypothesis|alternative hypotheses]], rather than a single hypothesis to avoid [[confirmation bias]].

The term "strong inference" was coined by [[John R. Platt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Science|volume=146|issue=3642|pages=347–53|year=1964|title=Strong inference| doi = 10.1126/science.146.3642.347 |pmid=17739513|author=John R. Platt|url=http://256.com/gray/docs/strong_inference.html|bibcode=1964Sci...146..347P}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Biophysics|biophysicist]] at the [[University of Chicago]]. Platt notes that some fields, such as [[molecular biology]] and [[high-energy physics]], seem to adhere strongly to strong inference, with very beneficial results for the rate of progress in those fields.

==The single hypothesis problem==

The problem with single hypotheses, [[confirmation bias]], was aptly described by [[Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin]] in 1897:
{{cquote|The moment one has offered an original explanation for a phenomenon which seems satisfactory, that moment affection for [one’s] intellectual child springs into existence, and as the explanation grows into a definite theory [one’s] parental affections cluster about [the] offspring and it grows more and more dear .... There springs up also unwittingly a pressing of the theory to make it fit the facts and a pressing of the facts to make them fit the theory...

The temptation to misinterpret results that contradict the desired hypothesis is probably irresistible. &lt;ref name="jewett2005"/&gt;}}

Despite the admonitions of Platt, reviewers of grant-applications often require "A Hypothesis" as part of the proposal (note the singular). Peer-review of research can help avoid the mistakes of single-hypotheses, but only so long as the reviewers are not in the thrall of the same hypothesis. If there is a shared enthrallment among the reviewers in a commonly believed hypothesis, then innovation becomes difficult because alternative hypotheses are not seriously considered, and sometimes not even permitted.

==Strong Inference==
&lt;!--(A note on typography: A name is capitalized ["the Dept. of Chemistry at Harvard"). "Strong Inference" is the name given by Platt to the method he describes, so both words should be capitalized.)--&gt;
The method, very similar to the [[scientific method]], is described as:
# Devising alternative [[hypotheses]];
# Devising a [[Experimentum crucis|crucial experiment]] (or several of them), with alternative possible outcomes, each of which will, as nearly as possible, exclude one or more of the hypotheses;
# Carrying out the experiment(s) so as to get a clean result;
# Recycling the procedure, making subhypotheses or sequential hypotheses to refine the possibilities that remain, and so on.

==Criticisms==
The original paper outlining strong inference has been criticized, particularly for overstating the degree that certain fields used this method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=O'Donohue|first=William|author-link=William O'Donohue|last2=Buchanan|first2=Jeffrey A.|date=|year=2001|title=The weaknesses of strong inference|url=http://www.behavior.org/resource.php?id=102|journal=Behavior and Philosophy|publisher=Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies|volume=29|pages=1–20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine|year=2006|title=Strong Inference: rationale or inspiration?|volume=49|number=2|pages=238–250|author=Rowland H. Davis|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/perspectives_in_biology_and_medicine/v049/49.2davis01.html|doi=10.1353/pbm.2006.0022|pmid=16702707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strong inference plus==
The limitations of Strong-Inference can be corrected by having two preceding phases:&lt;ref name="jewett2005"/&gt;
# An exploratory phase: at this point information is inadequate so observations are chosen randomly or intuitively or based on [[List of scientific method topics#Scientific creativity|scientific creativity]].
# A pilot phase: in this phase [[statistical power]] is determined by replicating experiments under identical experimental conditions.
These phases create the critical seed observation(s) upon which one can base alternative hypotheses.&lt;ref name="jewett2005"&gt;{{cite journal|date=1 January 2005|title=What’s wrong with single hypotheses? Why it is time for Strong-Inference-PLUS|author=Don L. Jewett

The '''Student Spaceflight Experiments Program''' ('''SSEP''') provides an opportunity for student groups from upper elementary school through university to design and fly [[microgravity]] experiments in [[low Earth orbit|low Earth orbit (LEO)]].&lt;ref name="ncesse_ssep"&gt;{{cite web | title = Student Spaceflight Experiments Program | work = ncesse.org | publisher = National Center for Earth and Space Science Education | date = October 30, 2012 | url = http://ncesse.org/programs/student-spaceflight-experiments-program/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; SSEP is a program of the [[National Center for Earth and Space Science Education]] (NCESSE, a project of the [[Tides Center]]), the [[Arthur C. Clarke]] Institute for Space Education, and the private space hardware company [[NanoRacks]].&lt;ref name="gaskill"/&gt; SSEP operates under a [[Space Act Agreement]] between the sponsoring organizations and [[NASA]], allowing the  [[International Space Station]] (ISS) to be utilized as a [[Center for the Advancement of Science in Space|national laboratory]].&lt;ref name="spaceref"&gt;{{cite web | title = Student Spaceflight Experiments Program – Mission 6 to the International Space Station | work = spaceref.com | publisher = SpaceRef Interactive Inc. | date = October 30, 2013 | url = http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=44901 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The program was launched in June 2010, by NCESSE in the U.S. and by the Clarke Institute internationally.&lt;ref name="gaskill"&gt;{{cite web | last = Gaskill | first = Melissa | title = Student Scientists Present Unexpected Results from Space Station Research | work = Space Station: Research &amp; Technology | publisher = [[NASA]] | date = August 6, 2014 | url = http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/2014_ssep_conference/#.VDsAivmwLYj }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2018}}, SSEP has sponsored fourteen missions to LEO – two on board the [[Space Shuttle]], and twelve to the ISS – with a thirteenth mission to the ISS announced in March 2018, and expected to fly in the spring/summer of 2019.&lt;ref name="ssep_in_the_news"&gt;{{cite web | title = SSEP in the News | work = Student Spaceflight Experiments Program Community Network Hubsite | publisher = National Center for Earth and Space Science Education | url = http://ssep.ncesse.org/communities/in-the-news/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mission7"&gt;{{cite web | last = Goldstein | first = Jeff | title = New Flight Opportunity for School Districts: Announcing Student Spaceflight Experiments Program (SSEP) Mission 7 to the International Space Station for 2014-15 Academic Year | work = ncesse.org | publisher = National Center for Earth and Space Science Education | date = April 21, 2014 | url = http://ssep.ncesse.org/2014/04/new-flight-opportunity-for-school-districts-announcing-student-spaceflight-experiments-program-ssep-mission-7-to-the-international-space-station-for-2014-15-academic-year/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mission 13"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Flight Opportunity for School Districts: Announcing Student Spaceflight Experiments Program (SSEP) Mission 13 to the International Space Station, Starting September 2018|url=http://ssep.ncesse.org/2018/03/new-flight-opportunity-for-school-districts-announcing-student-spaceflight-experiments-program-ssep-mission-13-to-the-international-space-station-starting-september-2018/|publisher=Student Spaceflight Experiments Program|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first fourteen SSEP flight opportunities, 86,800 students in grades 5 through 16 ([[Senior (education)|senior undergraduate]] in the [[higher education in the United States|U.S. higher education system]]) participated in experiment design and proposal writing. Of 18,759 proposals received, a total of 240 experiments were selected for flight, with one from each community participating in each flight opportunity. {{As of|2017|8|14}}, 206 of these experiments have been successfully launched.&lt;ref name="experiments_selected"&gt;{{cite web | title = Experiments Selected for Flight | work = Student Spaceflight Experiments Program Community Network Hubsite | publisher = National Center for Earth and Space Science Education | url = http://ssep.ncesse.org/communities/experiments-selected-for-flight/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 18 experiments comprising Mission 6 to the ISS were lost when the [[Cygnus CRS Orb-3]] vehicle exploded shortly after launch on 28 October 2014.&lt;ref name=bever&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bever|first1=Lindsey|title=Students lost science experiments in Antares explosion|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/10/29/students-lost-science-experiments-in-antares-explosion/|accessdate=31 October 2014|work=The Washington Post|date=October 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
The competition to select student projects for flight is designed to resemble a standard [[research proposal]] process. Interested groups must submit proposals in response to [[request for proposal|announced criteria]]; these proposals are then [[peer-review]]ed against the criteria in a two-stage selection process, with the vast majority of proposals rejected.&lt;ref name="the_competition"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Flight Experiment Design Competition | work = ncesse.org | publisher = National Center for Earth and Space Science Education  | url = http://ssep.ncesse.org/about-ssep/the-flight-experiment-design-competition/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each selected experiment is provided with one mini-laboratory, which is flown on the ISS and then returned to Earth for analysis.&lt;ref name="mission7"/&gt; Experiments selected for flight have included research into [[crystal growth]], [[composting]], [[cell division]], [[seed germination]], and [[calcium metabolism]].&lt;ref name="mission4_selected"&gt;{{cite web | title = Selected Experiments on SSEP Mission 4 to ISS | work = Student Spaceflight Experiments Program Community Network Hubsite | publisher = National Center for Earth and Space Science Education | url = http://ssep.ncesse.org/communities/experiments-selected-for-flight/selected-experiments-on-ssep-mission-4-to-iss/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mission5_selected"&gt;{{cite web | title = Selected Experiments on SSEP Mission 5 to ISS | work = Student Spaceflight Experiments Program Community Network Hubsite | publisher = National Center for Earth and Space Science Education | url = http://ssep.ncesse.org/communities/experiments-selected-for-flight/selected-experiments-on-ssep-mission-5-to-iss/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mission6_selected"&gt;{{cite web | title = Selected Experiments on SSEP Mission 6 to ISS | work = Student Spaceflight Experiments Program Community Network Hubsite | publisher = National Center for Earth and Space Science Education | url = http://ssep.ncesse.org/communities/experiments-selected-for-flight/selected-experiments-on-ssep-mission-6-to-iss/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of each experiment is on the order of [[United States dollar|US$]]24,500, which must be raised by the community developing the experiment.&lt;ref name="bass"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ssep.ncesse.org/about-ssep/ssep-program-costs/|title=SSEP Program costs|last=|first=|date=|work=ncesse.org|publisher=National Center for Earth and Space Science Education|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students have an opportunity to share their research at a national conference sponsored by the Smithsonian [[National Air and Space Museum]], NCESSE, and the Clarke Institute.&lt;ref name="gaskill"/&gt; Students participating in the program have also been given the chance to participate in a [[videoconferencing|videoconference]] with space station astronauts.&lt;ref name="nasm"&gt;{{cite web | last = Grove | first = Tim | title = An Out-of-This-World Program | work = nasm.si.edu | publisher = Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum | date = April 26, 2013 | url = http://blog.nasm.si.edu/education/an-out-of-this-world-program/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3519">'''Technological somnambulism''' is a concept used when talking about the [[philosophy of technology]]. The term was used by [[Langdon Winner]] in his essay ''Technology as forms of life''. Winner puts forth the idea that we are simply in a state of ''sleepwalking'' in our mediations with [[technology]]. This sleepwalking is caused by a number of factors.  One of the primary causes is the way we view technology as tools, something that can be put down and picked up again.  Because of this view of objects as something we can easily separate ourselves from technology, and so we fail to look at the long term implications of using that object. A second factor is the separation of those who make the technology and those who use the technology. This division causes there to be little thought and research going into the effects of using/developing that technology. The third and most important idea is the way in which technology seems to create new ''worlds'' in which we live. These worlds are created by the restructuring of the common and seemingly everyday things around us. In most situations the changes take place with little attention or care from us because we are more focused on the menial aspects of &lt;!--using that--&gt;the technology (Winner 105-107).&lt;ref&gt;Winner, Langdon. "[http://hettingern.people.cofc.edu/Nature_Technology_and_Society_Fall_2010/Winner_Ttechnologies_as_Forms_of_Life.pdf Technologies as Forms of Life]". ''Readings in the Philosophy of Technology''. David M. Kaplan. Oxford: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0742564015}}. 103-113&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept can be found in the earlier work of [[Marshall McLuhan]], cf. ''[[Understanding Media]]'', where he refers to a comment made by [[David Sarnoff]] expressing a [[social determinism|socially deterministic]] view of "value free" technology whose value is solely defined by its usage as representing, "...the voice of the current somnambulism".&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall. ''Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man''. New York: McGraw Hill, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; Given that this piece by McLuhan has become standard reading in [[Media Theory]] it is reasonable to suspect that Winner encountered the concept there or elsewhere and then went on to develop it further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.cc.gatech.edu/je77/222|title=Media Theory Reading List|website=home.cc.gatech.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csmt.uchicago.edu/reading/montgomery.htm|title=Media Theory Reading List -- Harper Montgomery|website=csmt.uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://english.ucalgary.ca/Digital%20Humanities | title=Media Digital Humanities | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603180344/http://english.ucalgary.ca/Digital%20Humanities | archivedate=2013-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Third Culture: Beyond the Scientific Revolution''''' is a 1995 book by [[John Brockman (literary agent)|John Brockman]] which discusses the work of several well-known scientists who are directly communicating their new, sometimes provocative, ideas to the general public. John Brockman has continued the themes of 'The Third Culture' in the website of the [[Edge Foundation, Inc.|Edge Foundation]], where leading scientists and thinkers contribute their thoughts in plain English.

The title of the book refers to [[Charles Percy Snow]]'s 1959 work ''[[The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution]]'', which described the conflict between the cultures of the [[humanities]] and [[science]].

The book influenced the reception of popular scientific literature in parts of the world beyond the United States. In Germany, the book inspired several newspapers to integrate scientific reports into their "[[Feuilleton]]" or "culture" sections (such as the ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]''). At the same time, the assertions of the book were discussed as a source of controversy, especially the implicit assertion that "third culture thinking" is mainly an American development. Critics acknowledge that, whereas in the Anglo-Saxon cultures there is a large tradition of scientists writing popular books, such tradition was absent for a long period in the German and French languages, with journalists often filling the gap. However, some decades ago there were also scientists, like the physicists [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] and [[Schrödinger]] and the psychologist [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]], who fulfill the criteria Brockman named for "third culture." The German author [[Gabor Paal]] suggested that the idea of the "third culture" is a rather modern version of what [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] called [[Realphilosophie]] (''philosophy of the real'').

Also, already during the [[interwar period]], [[Otto Neurath]] and other members of the [[Vienna Circle]] strongly propagated the need for both the [[unity of science]] and the popularization of new scientific concepts. With the rise of the Nazis in Germany and Austria, many of the Vienna Circle's members left for the United States where they taught in several universities, causing their philosophical ideas to spread in the Anglo-Saxon world throughout the 1930s-1940s.

'''''Wholeness and the Implicate Order''''' is a book by theoretical physicist [[David Bohm]]. It was originally published 1980 by [[Routledge]], Great Britain.

The book is considered a basic reference for Bohm's concepts of undivided wholeness and of [[implicate and explicate order according to David Bohm|implicate and explicate orders]], as well as of Bohm's rheomode - an experimental language based on verbs. The book is cited, for example, by philosopher [[Steven M. Rosen]] in his book ''The Self-evolving Cosmos'',&lt;ref name="Rosen2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven M. Rosen|title=The Self-evolving Cosmos: A Phenomenological Approach to Nature's Unity-in-diversity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GaTyMM1mnj0C&amp;pg=PA83|date=1 January 2008|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-277-174-2|pages=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; by mathematician and theologian [[Kevin J.
