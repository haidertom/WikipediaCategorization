[[File:Arts District, Las Vegas, United States (Unsplash).jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Pink Cadillac in the Downtown Arts District.]]

The '''Las Vegas Arts District''', or the '''18b''' in [[Downtown Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] was created in 1998 as an 18 block zone set aside to encourage art and artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Downtown Arts District  | url=http://www.fodors.com/world/north-america/usa/nevada/las-vegas/review-178016.html | work=[[Fodor's Travel]] | publisher=[[Random House]] | accessdate=9 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The district won [[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'s ''Best of Las Vegas'' award in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Ken |last = White| title=Downtown Arts District finally taking hold | url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/bestoflv/2005/bestartsdistrict.jsp;jsessionid=BMGLLJLEFKAA | work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]] | accessdate=9 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Known as the 18b, the Las Vegas Arts District contains a mix of independent businesses including [[vintage clothing]] boutiques, antique stores, art galleries, hair salons, restaurants,  
The 18b is located halfway between the Fremont East Entertainment district and the Stratosphere Resort, clustered around Main and Charleston, bounded loosely by Commerce Street to the West, Hoover Avenue to the North, Fourth Street to the East and Wyoming Avenue at the south. It is an easy bike ride, walk or bus ride from Fremont Street.  The name, "18b," represents the original Arts District area, which consisted of 18 blocks. Today, the Arts District area has grown beyond those original 18 blocks and is a classic urban mix of residential, commercial and cultural uses that will continue to grow as the hub of the arts scene in Las Vegas.

The "First Friday" Art Walk is a monthly arts and cultural event drawing up to 30,000 visitors into the neighborhood on the first Friday evening of each month. This event encourages people to flock downtown to browse, buy, eat, drink and mingle. The event is a festival environment with food and beverage vendors, music, visual performances and artists/artisans/craftspeople displaying their works.

== Events ==
The district hosts a ''First Friday'' art walk on the first Friday of every month.  First Friday offers an eclectic group of artists as well as "entertainers of all types, including local bands, fire breathers, acrobats, break dancers, fortune tellers and performance artists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Artsy Schmartzy | url=http://www.jewishlasvegas.com/page.aspx?id=148648 | publisher=[[United Jewish Communities]] | accessdate=9 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to ''First Friday'', Preview Thursday is held preceding night before the block party. It is a subdued night of gallery openings and special events around the arts district without the large crowds that the main event can bring.

== Boundaries ==
The district is loosely bounded by Hoover Avenue, Wyoming Avenue, [[Las Vegas Boulevard]], and Commerce Street. The official bounds are visible on the ''City of Las Vegas'' website.

'''Aestheticism''' (also the '''Aesthetic Movement''') is an intellectual and [[art movement]] supporting the emphasis of [[aesthetic]] values more than social-political themes for [[literature]], [[fine art]], [[music]] and other [[art]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Paul|last=Fargis|title=The New York Public Library Desk Reference - 3rd Edition|year=1998|publisher=Macmillan General Reference|pages=261|isbn=0-02-862169-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Denney, Colleen. [https://books.google.com/books?id=RvTZrnmy5RoC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=%22Aesthetic+movement%22+swinburne&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fQGt-5H3y4&amp;sig=Ir3QCh29f7c926rkx620LbcB5fs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7kjKSuy9BNDdlAebobGSAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Aesthetic%20movement%22%20swinburne&amp;f=false "At the Temple of Art: the Grosvenor Gallery, 1877-1890"], Issue 1165, p. 38, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2000 {{ISBN|0-8386-3850-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This meant that art from this particular movement focused more on being beautiful rather than having a deeper meaning&amp;nbsp;— "art for art's sake". It was particularly prominent in Europe during the 19th century, supported by notable figures such as [[Walter Pater]] and [[Oscar Wilde]], but contemporary critics are also associated with the movement, such as [[Harold Bloom]], who has recently argued against projecting social and political ideology onto literary works, which he believes has been a growing problem in humanities departments over the 20th century. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In the 19th century, it was related to other movements such as [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] or [[Decadent movement|decadence]] represented in France, or [[decadentism]]o represented in Italy, and may be considered the British version of the same style.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Aesthetic literature==
The British decadent writers were much influenced by the [[Oxford]] professor [[Walter Pater]] and his essays published during 1867–68, in which he stated that life had to be lived intensely, with an ideal of beauty.  His text ''Studies in the History of the Renaissance'' (1873) was very well regarded by art-oriented young men of the late 19th century. Writers of the [[Decadent movement]] used the slogan "[[Art for Art's Sake]]" (''L'art pour l'art''), the origin of which is debated. Some claim that it was invented by the philosopher [[Victor Cousin]], although [[Angela Leighton]] in the publication ''On Form: Poetry, Aestheticism and the Legacy of a Word'' (2007) notes that the phrase was used by [[Benjamin Constant]] as early as 1804.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Leighton (2007) 32.&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally accepted to have been promoted by [[Théophile Gautier]] in France, who interpreted the phrase to suggest that there was not any real association between art and [[morality]].

[[Image:Design for an Aesthetic theatrical poster.png|thumb|left|300px|One of many ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoons about æsthetes]]
The artists and writers of Aesthetic style tended to profess that the Arts should provide refined sensuous pleasure, rather than convey moral or sentimental messages. As a consequence, they did not accept [[John Ruskin]],  [[Matthew Arnold]], and [[George MacDonald]]'s conception of art as something moral or useful, "Art for truth's sake".&lt;ref&gt;Raeper, William (1987) George MacDonald, p. 183. Tring, Herts., and Batavia, IL: Lion Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they believed that Art did not have any [[didactic]] purpose; it only needed to be beautiful. The Aesthetes developed a cult of beauty, which they considered the basic factor of art. Life should copy Art, they asserted. They considered nature as crude and lacking in design when compared to art. The main characteristics of the style were: suggestion rather than statement, sensuality, great use of symbols, and [[Synesthesia|synaesthetic]]/[[ideasthesia|Ideasthetic]] effects—that is, correspondence between words, colours and music. Music was used to establish mood.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Predecessors of the Aesthetics included [[John Keats]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], and some of the [[Pre-Raphaelite]]s who themselves were a legacy of the Romantic spirit. There are a few significant continuities between the Pre-Raphaelite philosophy and that of the Aesthetes: Dedication to the idea of ‘Art for Art’s Sake’; admiration of, and constant striving for, beauty; escapism through visual and literary arts; craftsmanship that is both careful and self-conscious; mutual interest in merging the arts of various media. This final idea is promoted in the poem ''L’Art'' by [[Théophile Gautier]], who compared the poet to the sculptor and painter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to the Aesthetic Movement in English Literature|last=McMullen|first=Lorraine|publisher=Bytown Press|year=1971|isbn=|location=Ottawa, ON|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Edward Burne-Jones]] are most strongly associated with Aestheticism. However, their approach to Aestheticism did not share the creed of ‘Art for Art’s Sake’ but rather “a spirited reassertion of those principles of colour, beauty, love, and cleanness that the drab, agitated, discouraging world of the mid-nineteenth century needed so much.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Pre-Raphaelites in Literature and Art|last=Welland|first=Dennis S. R.|publisher=George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd.|year=1953|isbn=|location=London, UK|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reassertion of beauty in a drab world also connects to Pre-Raphaelite escapism in art and poetry.

In Britain the best representatives were [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], both influenced by the French Symbolists, and [[James McNeill Whistler]] and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]. The style and these poets were satirised by [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s comic opera ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' and other works, such as [[F. C. Burnand]]'s drama ''[[The Colonel (play)|The Colonel]]'', and in comic magazines such as ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]],'' particularly in works by George Du Maurier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=YgrdCQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=michele%20mendelssohn&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Henry James, Oscar Wilde and Aesthetic Culture|last=Mendelssohn|first=Michèle|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0748623853|location=|pages=22–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Compton Mackenzie]]'s novel ''[[Sinister Street]]'' makes use of the type as a phase through which the protagonist passes as he is influenced by older, decadent individuals. The novels of [[Evelyn Waugh]], who was a young participant of aesthete society at Oxford, describe the aesthetes mostly satirically, but also as a former participant. Some names associated with this assemblage are [[Robert Byron]], [[Evelyn Waugh]], [[Harold Acton]], [[Nancy Mitford]], [[A.E. Housman]] and [[Anthony Powell]].

==Aesthetic visual arts==

Artists associated with the Aesthetic style include Simeon Solomon, [[James McNeill Whistler]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], and [[Aubrey Vincent Beardsley|Aubrey Beardsley]]. Although the work of [[Edward Burne-Jones]] was exhibited at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]] which promoted the movement, it also contains narrative and  conveys moral or sentimental messages hence it falls outside the given definition.

==Aesthetic Movement decorative arts==
[[File:Florian Papp Aesthetic Exhibition.jpg|thumb|Aesthetic Movement antiques at [[Florian Papp]], New York City]]
The primary element of Decorative Art is utility. The maxim "art for art's sake", identifying art or beauty as the primary element in other branches of the Aesthetic Movement, especially [[fine art]], cannot apply in this context. Decorative art must first have utility, but may also be beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Dresser]]. ''The Art of Decorative Design'' 1862.&lt;/ref&gt; Decorative art is dissociated from fine art.&lt;ref&gt;''The Illustrated London News'' LXXXI, Saturday, August 12, 1882, p.175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Important elements of the Aesthetic Movement have been identified as Reform and Eastern Art.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Morley. ''Reform and Eastern Art'' Decorative Arts Society Journal, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Government Schools of Design were founded from 1837 onwards in order to improve the design of British goods. Following the Great Exhibition of 1851 efforts were intensified and Oriental objects purchased for the schools teaching collections. [[Owen Jones (architect)|Owen Jones]], architect and Orientalist was requested to set out key principles of design and these became not only the basis of the schools teaching but also the propositions which preface ''The Grammar of Ornament'' (1856), which is still regarded as the finest systematic study or practical sourcebook of historic world ornament.

Jones identified the need for a new and modern style that would meet the requirements of the modern world, rather than the continual re-cycling of historic styles, but saw no reason to reject the lessons of the past. [[Christopher Dresser]], a student and later Professor at the school  worked with Owen Jones on ''The Grammar of Ornament'', as well as on the 1863 decoration of The Oriental Courts (Chinese, Japanese, and Indian) at the South Kensington Museum, advanced the search for a new style with his two publications ''The Art of Decorative Design'' 1862, and ''Principles of Design'' 1873.

Production of Aesthetic style furniture was limited to approximately the late 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Aesthetic style furniture is characterized by several common themes:
* [[Ebonized]] wood with gilt highlights.
* Far Eastern influence.
* Prominent use of nature, especially flowers, birds, ginkgo leaves, and peacock feathers.
* Blue and white on [[porcelain]] and other fine china.

Ebonized furniture means that the wood is painted or stained to a black ebony finish. The furniture is sometimes completely ebony-colored. More often however, there is gilding added to the carved surfaces of the feathers or stylized flowers that adorn the furniture.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

As aesthetic movement decor was similar to the corresponding writing style in that it was about sensuality and nature, nature themes often appear on the furniture. A typical aesthetic feature is the gilded carved flower, or the stylized peacock feather. Colored paintings of birds or flowers are often seen. Non-ebonized aesthetic movement furniture may have realistic-looking three-dimensional-like renditions of birds or flowers carved into the wood.

Contrasting with the ebonized-gilt furniture is use of blue and white for porcelain and china. Similar themes of peacock feathers and nature would be used in blue and white tones on dinnerware and other crockery. The blue and white design was also popular on square porcelain tiles. It is reported that [[Oscar Wilde]] used aesthetic decorations during his youth. This aspect of the movement was also satirised by ''Punch'' magazine and in ''Patience''.

In 1882 Oscar Wilde visited Canada, where he toured the town of Woodstock, Ontario and gave a lecture on May 29 titled "The House Beautiful".&lt;ref&gt;O'brien (1982) 114.&lt;/ref&gt; This particular lecture featured the early Aesthetic art movement, also known as the "Ornamental Aesthetic" art style, where local flora and fauna were celebrated as beautiful and textured, layered ceilings were popular. An example of this can be seen in [[Annandale National Historic Site]], located in Tillsonburg, Ontario, Canada. The house was built in 1880 and decorated by Mary Ann Tillson, who happened to attend Oscar Wilde's lecture in Woodstock, and was influenced by it. Since the Aesthetic art movement was only prevalent from about 1880 until about 1890, there are not many surviving examples of this particular stylem but one such example is [[18 Stafford Terrace]], London, which provides an insight into how the middle classes interpreted the principles of Aesthetics.

[[File:The mmuo of a girl.jpg|thumb|An Agbogho Mmuo and two attendees]]
'''Agbogho Mmuo''', or '''Maiden [[Igbo mythology|Spirits]]''' are annual performances held during the [[dry season]] in the [[Nri-Igbo|Nri]]-[[Awka]] area in the northern part of the [[Igbo people|Igbo]]s' traditional territory. Performed only by men wearing [[African traditional masks|masks]], the masquerades imitate the character of [[adolescence|adolescent]] girls, exaggerating the girls' beauty and movements. The performance is always accompanied by [[Igbo music|musicians]] who sing and play tributes to both real and spirit maidens.

The performances showcase an ideal image of an Igbo maiden. This ideal is made up by the smallness of a young girl’s features and the whiteness of her complexion, which is an indication that the mask is a spirit. This whiteness is created using a chalk substance used for ritually marking the body in both West Africa and the [[African Diaspora]]. The chalky substance is also used in [[Uli (design)|uli design]], created and exhibited on the skin of Igbo women. Most maiden spirit mask are decorated with representations of hair combs, and other objects, modeled after late 19th-century ceremonial hairstyles. These hairstyles include elaborate coiffures and crests which intend to add beauty to the mask.

This art style is featured in the book [[Purple Hibiscus]] written by [[Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24011">An '''album cover''' is the front of the packaging of a commercially released audio recording product, or [[album]]. The term can refer to either the printed cardboard covers typically used to package sets of {{convert|10|in|cm|abbr=on}} and {{convert|12|in|cm|abbr=on}} 78-rpm records, single and sets of {{convert|12|in|cm|abbr=on}} [[LP record|LP]]s, sets of 45 rpm records (either in several connected sleeves or a box), or the front-facing panel of a [[compact disc|CD]] [[optical disc packaging|package]], and, increasingly, the primary image accompanying a [[music download|digital download]] of the album, or of its individual [[Track (CD)|tracks]].

In the case of all types of tangible records, it also serves as part of the protective sleeve.

== Early history ==
Around 1910, 78-rpm records replaced the [[phonograph cylinder]] as the medium for recorded sound. The 78-rpm records were issued in both 10- and 12-inch diameter sizes and were usually sold separately, in brown paper or cardboard sleeves that were sometimes plain and sometimes printed to show the producer or the retailer's name. These were invariably made out of acid paper, limiting conservability. Generally the sleeves had a circular cutout allowing the record label to be seen. Records could be laid on a shelf horizontally or stood upright on an edge, but because of their fragility, many broke in storage.

German record company [[Odeon Records|Odeon]] pioneered the "album" in 1909 when it released the ''[[Nutcracker Suite]]'' by [[Tchaikovsky]] on four double-sided discs in a specially designed package.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document | url=http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/notes.html#cylinder | title= Recording Technology History | date= 6 July 2005 | first= Steve |last= Schoenherr | publisher= [[University of San Diego]] | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070329065002/http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/notes.html#cylinder | archivedate= 29 March 2007 | accessdate= 27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (It is not indicated what the specially designed package was.) The practice of issuing albums does not seem to have been taken up by other record companies for many years.

Beginning in the 1920s, bound collections of empty sleeves with a plain [[paperboard]] or [[leather]] cover were sold as "[[record albums]]" (similar to a photograph album) that customers could use to store their records. (The name "record album" was printed on some covers.) These empty albums were sold in both 10- and 12-inch sizes.&lt;ref name=personal&gt;Example in personal collection.&lt;/ref&gt; The covers of these bound books were wider and taller than the records inside, allowing the record album to be placed on a shelf upright, like a book, and suspending the fragile records above the shelf, protecting them.

Starting in the 1930s, record companies began issuing collections of 78-rpm records by one performer or of one type of music in specially assembled collections. These albums of several 78-rpm records could include a collection of popular songs related by either performer or style, or extended-length [[classical music]], including complete symphonies.&lt;ref name=personal /&gt;

In 1938, [[Columbia Records]] hired [[Alex Steinweiss]] as its first [[art director]]. He is credited with inventing the concept of album covers and [[Cover art#Album cover art|cover art]], replacing the plain covers used before. After his initial efforts at Columbia, other record companies followed his lead. By the late 1940s, record albums for all the major companies featured their own colorful paper covers in both 10- and 12-inch sizes. Some featured reproductions of classic art while others utilized original designs.

When the 10- and 12-inch long-playing records ([[LP record|LP]]s) came along in 1948, and box sets of 45-rpm records soon followed (see [[gramophone record]]), the name "album" was used for the new format of collections, and the creation of artistic original album covers continued.

== Formats ==
From the 1950s through to the 1980s, the 12" LP record and the 45 rpm record became the major formats for the distribution of [[popular music]]. The LP format remains in use  for occasional new releases, though other formats have largely supplanted it. The size of the typical cardboard LP sleeve cover is {{convert|12.375|in|cm|abbr=on}} square.

Since the mid-1990s, the [[compact disc]] (CD) has become the most common form of physically-distributed music products. [[Optical disc packaging|Packaging formats]] vary, including the jewel case (which since 1982 has been the most popular form of CD packaging), and the cardboard and plastic combination commonly known as a [[Digipak]] (which has been a popular alternative form of packaging in recent years, but remains supplanted by the jewel case due to higher manufacturing costs and lower durability). Typically the album cover component of these packages is approximately {{convert|4.75|in|cm|abbr=on}} square.

== Design ==

The Album Art Cover with eyecatching illustration, vibrant colours and lettering, is generally attributed to the American designer Alex Steinweiss in the 1950s.
{{see also|Cover art#Album cover art}}
The cover became an important part of the culture of music.&lt;ref name="Doggett p 393"&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Doggett|year=2015|title=Electric Shock: From the Gramophone to the iPhone: 125 Years of Pop Music |publisher=The Bodley Head|location=London|isbn=978-1-847922182|p=393}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the influence of designers like [[Bob Cato]],{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} who at various stages in his long music career was vice president of creative services at both [[Columbia Records]] and [[United Artists]], album covers became renowned for being a marketing tool and an expression of artistic intent.&lt;ref name="Doggett p 393" /&gt; Album art has also been discussed as an important postwar cultural expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/958205262|title=Designed for hi-fi living : the vinyl LP in midcentury America|last=Borgerson|first=Janet|publisher=MIT Press|others=Schroeder, Jonathan E., 1962-|year=2017|isbn=9780262036238|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=|oclc=958205262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1960s, [[the Beatles]]' ''[[With the Beatles]]'', [[Bob Dylan]]'s ''[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (album)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]'' and [[the Rolling Stones]]' [[The Rolling Stones (album)|self-titled debut album]] each contained a cover photograph designed to further the musical artist's public image. Author [[Peter Doggett]] also highlights the cover of [[Otis Redding]]'s ''[[Otis Blue]]'', containing a photo of a young white woman, as a design that "played a dual role: she represented the transcendent power of the music, and obscured the race of its creator."&lt;ref name="Doggett p 393" /&gt; The standard portrait-based LP cover was further challenged over 1965–66 by Dylan's ''[[Bringing It All Back Home]]'', through the inclusion of symbolic artefacts around the singer; the artificially stretched faces of the Beatles shown on their ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' album; and the darkened hues applied to the Rolling Stones on ''[[Aftermath (The Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]''.&lt;ref name="Doggett p 393" /&gt;

[[Gatefold|Gatefold cover]]s (a folded double cover) and inserts, often with lyric sheets, made the album cover a desirable work in its own right. Notable examples are [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', which had cut-out inserts, printed lyrics, and a gatefold sleeve, even though it was a single album; [[the Rolling Stones]]' ''[[Exile on Main Street]]'', which had a gatefold and a series of 12 perforated postcards as inserts (taken by photographer [[Norman Seeff]]); and [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'', which had a gatefold, lyrics, no title on the sleeve, and poster and sticker inserts. [[The Band]]'s 1970 release ''[[Stage Fright (album)|Stage Fright]]'', which included a photograph by Seeff as a poster insert, is an early example of LP artwork quickly becoming a collector's item. The move to the small (less than 1/4 the size of a record) CD format lost that impact, although attempts have been made to create a more desirable packaging for the CD format, for example the reissue of ''Sgt. Pepper'', which had a cardboard box and booklet, or the use of oversized packaging.

The importance of design was such that some cover artists specialised or gained fame through their work. Such people include the design team [[Hipgnosis]], through their work on [[Pink Floyd]] albums, amongst others; [[Roger Dean (artist)|Roger Dean]], famous for his [[Yes (band)|Yes]] and [[Greenslade]] covers; [[Cal Schenkel]], for [[Captain Beefheart]]'s ''[[Trout Mask Replica]]'' and [[Frank Zappa]]'s ''[[We're Only in It for the Money]]''.

The talents of many photographers and illustrators from both inside and outside of the music industry have been used to produce a vast array of memorable LP/CD covers. Photographer [[Mick Rock]] produced some of the most iconographic album covers of the 1970s, including [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s ''[[Queen II]]'' (recreated for their classic music video [[Bohemian Rhapsody]]), [[Syd Barrett]]'s ''[[The Madcap Laughs]]'', and [[Lou Reed]]'s ''[[Transformer (album)|Transformer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6613107.stm Photographer lives the Rock dream] BBC News. Retrieved May 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; From 1972 to 1975, photographer [[Norman Seeff]] was Creative Director at [[United Artists]] and in addition to his many cover photographs ([[The Band]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]'s [[Hotter than Hell (album)|Hotter than Hell]], [[Joni Mitchell]]'s [[Hejira (album)|Hejira]] etc.), he art directed dozens of album covers including ''[[Exile on Main Street]]'', many of which received [[Grammy]] nominations. In addition to the examples mentioned previously, a number of world-renowned graphic artists and illustrators such as [[Ed Repka]] ([[Megadeth]]), [[Andy Warhol]] ([[The Velvet Underground]],&lt;ref&gt;Walker, John. (1987) [http://www.artdesigncafe.com/Andy-Warhol-Velvet-Underground "Andy Warhol &amp; the Velvet Underground"]. In ''Cross-Overs: Art into Pop, Pop into Art'' (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Rolling Stones]]), [[Mati Klarwein]] ([[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[Miles Davis]]), [[H. R. Giger]] ([[Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer]], [[Debbie Harry]]), [[Frank Frazetta]] ([[Molly Hatchet]]), [[Derek Riggs]] ([[Iron Maiden]]), [[Jamie Reid]] ([[The Sex Pistols]]), [[Howard Finster]] ([[R.E.M.]], [[Talking Heads]]), [[Al Hirschfeld]] ([[Aerosmith]]), [[Ken Kelly (artist)|Ken Kelly]] ([[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Manowar]]), [[Gottfried Helnwein]] ([[Marilyn Manson]]), [[Rex Ray]] ([[David Bowie]]), [[Robert Crumb]] ([[Big Brother &amp; the Holding Company]]), [[John Van Hamersveld]] (The Rolling Stones), and [[Shepard Fairey]] ([[Johnny Cash]]) have all applied their talents to memorable music packages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/948670847|title=Total records : photography and the art of the album cover|others=Beaupré, Antoine de,, Vincendet, Serge,, Stourdzé, Sam,, Denis, Jacques,, Mondino, Jean-Baptiste, 1949-|isbn=9781597113847|edition=First Aperture|location=New York, N.Y.|oclc=948670847}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/952207403|title=Art record covers|last=1978-|first=Spampinato, Francesco,|others=Wiedemann, Julius,|isbn=9783836540292|location=[Koln, Germany]|oclc=952207403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of record covers have also used images licensed (or borrowed from the public domain) from artists of bygone eras. Well-known examples of this include the cover of [[Derek and the Dominos]] ''[[Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs]]'' (from the painting "La Fille au Bouquet" by French painter and sculptor [[Émile Théodore Frandsen de Schomberg]]), 'The Downfall of Icarus' by Genisson on the cover of the first album by [[Renaissance (band)|Renaissance]]; [[Hieronymus Bosch|Bosch]] on the cover of [[Deep Purple (album)|Deep Purple]]; [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Breugel]] on the cover of [[Fleet Foxes (album)|Fleet Foxes]]; the cover of Kansas's debut album, adapted from a mural by painter [[John Steuart Curry]], [[Norman Rockwell]]'s cowboy ([[Pure Prairie League]]), and, more recently, [[Coldplay]]'s ''[[Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends|Viva La Vida]]'', which features [[Eugène Delacroix]]'s painting ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' (a favorite in [[The Louvre]]) with the words "VIVA LA VIDA" brushed on top in white paint.

Legends from photography and video/film who have also produced record cover images include [[Drew Struzan]] ([[Black Sabbath]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Iron Butterfly]], [[The Beach Boys]] and others), [[Annie Leibovitz]] ([[John Lennon]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Patti Smith]]), [[Richard Avedon]] ([[Whitney Houston]], [[Teddy Pendergrass]]), [[David LaChappelle]] ([[No Doubt]], [[Elton John]]), [[Anton Corbijn]] ([[U2]], [[The Killers]], [[Depeche Mode]]), [[Karl Ferris]] ([[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Donovan]], [[The Hollies]]), [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] ([[Patti Smith]], [[Peter Gabriel]]) and [[Francesco Scavullo]] ([[Diana Ross]], [[Edgar Winter]]), [[David Michael Kennedy]] others.

A number of artists and bands feature members who are, in their own right, accomplished illustrators, designers and photographers and whose talents are exhibited in the artwork they produced for their own recordings. Examples include [[Jimmy Page]] (''Led Zeppelin IV''), [[Chris Mars]] (Replacements' ''Pleased to Meet Me'' and others), [[Marilyn Manson]] (''Lest We Forget...''), [[Michael Stipe]] (REM's ''Accelerator''), [[Thom Yorke]] (credited as "Tchocky" on misc. [[Radiohead]] records), [[Michael Brecker]] (''Ringorama''), [[Freddie Mercury]] (''Queen I''), [[Lynsey De Paul]] (''Surprise''), [[John Entwistle]] (''Who By Numbers''), [[Graham Coxon]] (''13'' and most solo albums), [[Mike Shinoda]] (various [[Linkin Park]] albums), [[Joni Mitchell]] (''Miles of Aisles'' and several others) as well for [[Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young]] (''So Far''), and [[M.I.A. (artist)|M.I.A.]] (credited variously on [[Elastica]]'s ''The Menace'', her records), and [[Captain Beefheart]], 'Mona Bone Jakon', 'Tea for the Tillerman' and 'Teaser and the Firecat' by [[Cat Stevens]], [[Mika (singer)|Mika]] (all albums released to date), ''[[Music from Big Pink]]'' (for The Band), ''Self Portrait'' and ''Planet Waves'' by [[Bob Dylan]], ''Walls and Bridges'' by [[John Lennon]].

Album cover art was the subject of a 2013 documentary film, ''The Cover Story: Album Art'', by Eric Christensen, a [[San Francisco Bay Area]] record collector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sam Whiting |url=http://www.sfgate.com/music/article/Film-puts-lively-spin-on-album-cover-art-4209802.php#page-1 |title=Film puts lively spin on album cover art |publisher=SFGate |date=2013-01-20 |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical design of album covers has been the subject of creative innovation. ''[[Ogden's Nut Gone Flake]]'' by the [[Small Faces]] was originally in a circular metal tin, and ''[[Happy to Meet – Sorry to Part]]'' by [[Horslips]] was in an octagonal package. [[Anyway (album)|Anyway]] by [[Family (band)|Family]] was originally issued in an opaque plastic package through which a design (a Leonardo sketch) could be seen. ''[[Magical Mystery Tour (album)|Magical Mystery Tour]]'' by the Beatles was first released as a double [[Extended play|EP]] with a booklet between the records. ''Sgt. Pepper'' contained a cardboard sheet of images, and ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'' (often referred to as the White Album) contained four large glossy photos of the individual Beatles along with a poster-sized collage. ''[[Live at Leeds]]'' by [[The Who]] also contained a generous supply of posters and printed material. ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]'' had a front cover that contained a revolving disc which brought different images into view through small cut-outs in the outer sleeve. A similar effect was used for the band's later album ''[[Physical Graffiti]]'' with cut-outs of the windows of a brownstone building. The original issue of ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' by [[the Rolling Stones]] had an actual zipper incorporated into the picture of the crotch area of a pair of jeans. ''[[The Velvet Underground and Nico]]'' album had a Warhol-designed cardboard banana on the cover that could be peeled back. The record company [[Vertigo Records|Vertigo]] had a black-and-white design on the centre label that produced a hypnotic optical effect when the disc revolved on the turntable.

== Packaging ==
The album cover is a component of the overall packaging of an album. Especially in the case of vinyl records with paperboard  sleeves, these packages are prone to wear and tear, although wear and tear does often take place to some degree on covers contained within plastic cases. A variety of treatments could be applied to improve both their appearance and durability, such as clear plastic wrap. Many products have been available for the storage of vinyl albums, often clear plastic sleeves.

The surface of a vinyl record is readily damaged, so aside from the outer [[paperboard]] sleeve, there is usually an inner protective cover to protect against dust and handling. This is normally shaped to allow it to readily slide within the outer cover. The inner sleeve is either thin white paper, either plain or printed with information on other recordings available from the same company, or a paper sleeve supporting a thin [[plastic bag]]. These quite often have a circular cut out so that the record label can be read without directly handling the record, though when the inner sleeve is printed with lyrics, which became quite common, then there is usually no hole. Decca Records used a system of colour-coding on these sleeves where a blue color denoted a [[stereophonic sound|stereophonic]] recording while red denoted a [[Monaural|monophonic]] recording (the mono record players of the time were not always compatible with stereo records). This system was begun in the 1960s to reduce packaging costs.

[[Optical disc packaging|Packaging formats for compact discs]] widened the variety of presentations as well, even as the size of the CD meant that album covers were no longer so large.

Besides the practicalities of identifying specific records, album covers serve the purpose of advertising the musical contents on the LP, through the use of [[graphic design]], [[photography]], and/or [[illustration]]. An album cover normally has the artist's name, sometimes in [[logo]] form; and the album title. Occasionally, though more common on historical vinyl records, the cover may include a reference number; a branding (the [[Record label|label]]), and possibly a track listing. Other information is seldom included on the cover, and is usually contained on the rear or interior of the packaging, such as a track listing together with a more detailed list of those involved in making the record, band members, guest performers, engineers and producer. On the ''spine'' of the package, the artist, title, and reference number are usually repeated so that albums can be identified while tightly packed on a shelf.

== Album covers in the age of downloads ==
With the increasing popularity of digital music downloading services and the inflating cost of conducting business, the purpose and prevalence of the album cover is evolving. While the [[music industry]] tries to keep up with technological and cultural shifts, the role that packaging (and thus the "album cover") will play in consumer music sales in the near future is uncertain, although its role is certainly changing{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}, and digital forms of packaging will continue to surface, which, to some degree (and to some consumers) take the place of physical packaging.  Both MP3 and WMA music files are able to contain embedded digital album artworks (called cover images or simply covers) in jpeg format. {{as of|2008}}, physical music products, with a physical "album cover", continue to outsell digital downloads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSN3049009520071231?sp=true|title=Digital album packaging should improve in 2008|first = Antony | last= Bruno|publisher=Reuters|date=31 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, album cover designer [[Peter Saville (artist)|Peter Saville]], responsible for cover art on albums by [[New Order (band)|New Order]] and [[Roxy Music]], suggested that the album cover was dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/45430/designer-peter-saville-the-album-cover-is-dead|title=Peter Saville Says Album Cover is Dead|author=Jason Gregory|publisher=Gigwise}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternately, some artists have used Internet technology to generate even more cover art. For instance, [[Nine Inch Nails]] initially released its album ''[[The Slip (album)|The Slip]]'' as a free download on the band's website, attaching separate but thematically connected images to each individual track.

One digital solution is the [[iTunes LP]] format for interactive album artwork introduced by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] on 9 September 2009.

Album art is still considered a vital part of the listening experience to many, and despite the less-tangible nature of digital images, there are still many collectors trading cover art and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albumartexchange.com/about.php |title=About |publisher=Albumartexchange.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151013083754/http://www.albumartexchange.com/about.php |archivedate=2015-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, Interactive Marketing and Creative Studio [https://www.hellobeaumonde.com/ Beaumonde] released a first of its kind fully [https://www.hellobeaumonde.com/blog/trill-sammy-press-release immersive and interactive album cover] for Houston-based rapper Trill Sammy. For the first time ever fans can view the 2D album like they traditionally would, then dive into the album cover via an immersive world available on Trill Sammy's Website. 

== Banned covers ==
{{expand section|date=September 2012}}
{{see also|List of controversial album art}}
Some album covers have been banned due to violence, nudity and other imagery. [[Guns N' Roses]]'s 1987 album ''[[Appetite for Destruction]]''{{'}}s cover depicted a robot rapist about to be punished by a metal avenger. [[Kanye West]]'s 2010 album ''[[My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy]]'' depicted West naked being straddled by a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] with her bare breasts and bare buttocks showing.

==Facts==
The plaintiff, [[Amar Nath Sehgal]] is a renowned artist and sculptor, who created a mural in the lobby of [[Vigyan Bhawan]], Delhi on the direction of appropriate authority. In the year 1957, the Government of India commissioned Mr. Sehgal for creating a bronze mural for Vigyan Bhavan, the most prominent International Convention Hall in Delhi. The Bronze sculpture so commissioned, of about 140&amp;nbsp;ft. span and 40&amp;nbsp;ft. sweep took five years to complete and was placed on the wall of the Lobby in the Convention hall. This embellishment on a national architecture became a part of the Indian art heritage. However, in 1979, the mural was pulled down and consigned to the store room of the Union without notice or permission or authorization of Amarnath. When Mr. Sehgal came to know of this ill treatment, he made representations to the government authorities for restoration of the mural, to no avail. As this act of destruction of the mural as it was improperly handled which cause minor damage to the sculpture. He filed a petition under Section 57 of the Copyright Act, 1957 in the Delhi High Court praying for an apology from the defendants, a permanent injunction on the defendants to restrain them from distorting, mutilating or damaging the plaintiff’s mural and damages to the tune of Rs. 50 lacs.

==Judgment==
The Court termed the Moral rights as the soul of the author’s works. "The author has a right to preserve, protect and nurture his creations through his moral rights. A creative individual is uniquely invested with the power and mystique of original genius, creating a privileged relationship between a creative author and his work."

The Court elucidated on the moral rights that flow from art and literary work .They are Identification right or attribution right, right to dissemination, Right to integrity that is to maintain the purity of work and right to withdraw from the publication of the work .The language of the Section 57 makes it possible to legally protect the cultural heritage of India through the moral rights of the artist. "Intellectual property and knowledge are interconnected. Intellectual property embodies traditional thought and knowledge with value addition. Thus, physical destruction or loss of intellectual property has far reaching social consequence. Knowledge which has grown with it is also lost." Court ruled that moral rights in the work of art acquire the  status of the cultural heritage of the nation and India being a signatory to many conventions , it would be the obligation of the state to protect such work.

Further, Section 57 of the Copyright Act, 1957 includes destruction of a work of art as a ground as it is the extreme form of mutilation and reduces the volume of the author’s creative corpus and affects his reputation prejudicially as being actionable under said section. Further, in relation to the work of an author, subject to the work attaining the status of a modern national treasure, the right would include an action to protect the integrity of the work in relation to the cultural heritage of the nation.

The Court held that the plaintiff has a cause to maintain an action under Section 57 of the Copyright Act, 1957 even though the copyright in the mural stands vested in the defendants. It was further held that the defendants have not only violated the plaintiff's moral right of integrity in the mural but have also violated the integrity of the work in relation to the cultural heritage of the nation. The Court ordered the defendants to return to the plaintiff the remnants of the mural permanently with no rights vesting with the defendants henceforth and ordered the defendants to pay damages with costs.

==Significance of the Decision==
The decision taken by the single bench of the Delhi High Court was instrumental in determining the course of moral rights in the country. It also gave a broad construction to the term moral rights in the country, by not only providing for the right of the author in the case of any distortion, mutilation, modification or other act in relation to the work if such distortion etc. would be prejudicial to his honour or reputation but also ‘right of the author to receive the copyrighted work for the purposes of restoration and sell it’. It included within the moral right of integrity the right to protect an artistic work from outright destruction. 
The interim decision in the case, given by Justice Jaspal Singh, given in favour of the plaintiff, restricted the Indian Government from causing any further loss to the plaintiff by destroying the property. The interim ruling, given in 1992, established two central points about the ambit of moral rights within India. Firstly, that the moral right of integrity under Indian Law can in fact protect an artistic work from outright destruction and secondly, that the Government has a duty of care towards artworks in its possession.
This gave rise to amendments in the Copyright Act in 1994. Even though the purported primary motive of the Government was to bring the Indian Act in conformity with the Berne Convention, the wording of the amendment seemed to be a direct reaction to the interim ruling.  Under the amended Section 57, a legal claim by an author against unauthorized modifications to his work had to establish that the treatment of the work has been prejudicial to his honour or reputation. The revised Section 57 corresponded to Article 6bis of the Berne Convention and also provided that failure to display a work, or to display it in accordance with the wishes of the author, would not qualify as a violation of the author’s moral rights.

In light of this amendment in 1994, an important question that Justice Nandrajog needed to address was that of which law would be applicable to the final ruling, the pre amendment or post amendment Copyright Act. There were compelling arguments for both the sides, as the old provisions of the Copyright Act would apply because they governed the time when the acts of destruction occurred, and when the case was actually filed before the court. On the other hand, he could have said that the post amended provisions should apply because they reflected the currently policy of the Govt. and were actually in force at the time of the judgment. However, he sidestepped the question and chose neither of the paths, arguing that the law must be read to fulfil the higher objective of protecting our cultural heritage, in light of the many international treaties on cultural heritage that India is a signatory to. The artwork in question constituted an ‘outstanding work of art’ and in such cases there is an overriding obligation to protect their integrity, no matter which law is applied.

An '''animated cartoon''' is a [[film]] for the [[movie theater|cinema]], [[television]] or computer screen, which is made using sequential [[drawing]]s, as opposed to [[animation]] in general, which include films made using [[clay animation|clay]], [[puppet]]s, [[3D modeling]] and other means. Animated cartoons are still created for entertainment, commercial, educational{{sfn|Dalacostaa|2009|p=1}} and personal purposes.

==History==
{{main|History of animation}}

===Early years===
Early examples of attempts to capture the phenomenon of [[motion (physics)|motion]] into a still drawing can be found in [[paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s, where animals are often depicted with multiple legs in superimposed positions, clearly attempting to convey the perception of motion.{{sfn|Thomas|1958|p=8}}

A 5,200-year old pottery bowl discovered in [[Shahr-e Sukhteh]], [[Iran]], has five sequential images painted around it that seem to show phases of a goat leaping up to nip at a tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thevisuallinguist.com/2006/02/burnt-city-animation-vl.html|title=The Visual Linguist: Burnt City animation VL|date=February 15, 2006|publisher=The Visual Linguist|last=Cohn|first=Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/article/8045|title=Oldest Animation Discovered In Iran|publisher=''Animation Magazine''|date=March 12, 2008|last=Ball|first=Ryan|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[phenakistoscope]] (1832), [[zoetrope]] (1834) and [[praxinoscope]] (1877), as well as the common [[flip book]], were early animation devices to produce movement from sequential drawings using technological means, but did not develop further until the advent of [[film|motion picture film]].

===Silent era===
[[File:How Animated Cartoons Are Made (1919).webm|thumb|''How Animated Cartoons Are Made'' (1919)]]
The first animated projection (screening) was created in France, by [[Charles-Émile Reynaud]], who was a French science teacher. Reynaud created the [[Praxinoscope]] in 1877 and the [[Théâtre Optique]] in December 1888.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|pp=3–4}} On 28 October 1892, he projected the first animation in public, ''[[Pauvre Pierrot]]'', at the Musée Grévin in Paris. This film is also notable as the first known instance of film perforations being used. His films were not photographed, but drawn directly onto the transparent strip.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|pp=5–6}} In 1900, more than 500,000 people had attended these screenings.

The first (photographed) animated projection was ''[[Humorous Phases of Funny Faces]]'' (1906) by newspaper cartoonist [[J. Stuart Blackton]],{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|pp=7–8}} one of the co-founders of the Vitagraph Company arrived.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=16}} In the film, a cartoonist's line drawings of two faces were 'animated' (or came to life) on a blackboard. The two faces smiled and winked, and the cigar-smoking man blew smoke in the lady's face; also, a circus clown led a small dog to jump through a hoop.

The first animated projection in the traditional sense (i.e., on [[film|motion picture film]]) was ''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' by the French director [[Émile Cohl]] in 1908.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=9}} This was followed by two more films, ''Le Cauchemar du fantoche'' [''The Puppet's Nightmare,'', now lost] and ''Un Drame chez les fantoches'' [''A Puppet Drama,'' called ''The Love Affair in Toyland'' for American release and ''Mystical Love-Making'' for British release], all completed in 1908.

One of the very first successful animated cartoons was ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]'' (1914) by [[Winsor McCay]].{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|pp=16–17}} It is considered the first example of true [[character animation]]. At first, animated cartoons were [[black-and-white]] and silent. [[Felix the Cat]] and [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]] are notable examples.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|pp=55, 59}}

==="Golden Age"===
{{main|Golden age of American animation}}
From the 1920s to 1960s, theatrical cartoons were produced in huge numbers, and usually shown before a feature film in a movie theater. [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] (distributed by [[Pat Powers (businessman)|Pat Powers]], then [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]], then [[United Artists]], then [[RKO Pictures|RKO]], then independently), [[Fleischer Studios|Fleischer]] (distributed by [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]), [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Warner Bros.]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM]], and [[UPA (animation studio)|UPA]] (distributed by [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]]) were the largest studios producing these 5- to 10-minute "shorts." Other studios included [[Walter Lantz Productions|Walter Lantz]] (distributed by [[Universal Studios|Universal]]), [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises|DePatie-Freleng]] (distributed by [[United Artists]]), [[Van Beuren Studios]] (distributed by [[RKO Pictures]]), [[ComiColor Cartoons]] (distributed by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]), [[Charles Mintz]] Studios (later [[Screen Gems]]) (distributed by [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]]), [[Famous Studios]] (distributed by [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]), and [[Terrytoons]] (distributed by [[20th Century Fox]]).

The first cartoon to use a [[soundtrack]] was in 1926 with [[Max Fleischer]]'s ''[[My Old Kentucky Home (movie)|My Old Kentucky Home]].'' However the Fleischers used a [[Lee De Forest|De Forest]] sound system and the sound was not completely synchronized with the film.{{sfn|Maltin|1980|p=89}} [[Walt Disney]]'s 1928 cartoon ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'' starring [[Mickey Mouse]] was the first to use a [[click track]] during the recording session, which produced better [[Synchronization|synchronism]]. "[[Mickey Mousing]]" became a term for any movie action (animated or [[live action]]) that was perfectly synchronized with music. The music used is original most of the time, but [[musical quotation]] is often employed. Animated characters usually performed the action in "loops," i.e., drawings were repeated over and over.

Although other producers had made films earlier using 2-strip color, Disney produced the first cartoon in 3-strip [[Technicolor]], ''[[Flowers and Trees]],'' in 1932. Technicians at the Fleischer studio invented [[rotoscoping]], in which animators trace live action in order to make animation look more realistic. However, rotoscoping made the animation look stiff and the technique was later used more for studying human and animal movement, rather than directly tracing and copying filmed movements.{{sfn|Thomas|1958|pp=14}}
Later, other movie technologies were adapted for use in animation, such as [[multiplane camera]]s with ''[[The Old Mill]]'' (1937),{{sfn|Maltin|1980|p=51}} [[stereophonic sound]] in ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940), widescreen processes with the feature-length ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' (1955), and even [[3-D film|3D]] with ''[[Lumber Jack-Rabbit]]''.{{sfn|Maltin|1980|p=265}} 

Today, [[traditional animation]] uses traditional methods, but is aided by [[computer]]s in certain areas. This gives the [[animator]] new tools not available that could not be achieved using old techniques.

==Feature films==
{{expand section|date=September 2011}}
{{main|Lists of animated feature films}}

In 1917, Italian-Argentine cartoonist [[Quirino Cristiani]] created the first animated feature ever made, ''[[El Apóstol]]'', utilizing cutout animation; however, a fire that destroyed producer Federico Valle's film studio incinerated the only known copy of the film, and it is now considered [[lost film|lost]].{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|pp=49–51}}

In 1937, Disney created the first sound and color animated feature film, ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|pp=66–67}}

The name "animated cartoon" is generally not used when referring to full-length animated productions, since the term more or less implies a "short." Huge numbers of animated feature films were, and are still, produced.

==Television==
Competition from television drew audiences away from movie theaters in the late 1950s, and the theatrical cartoon began its decline. Today, animated cartoons for American audiences are produced mostly for television.

American television animation of the 1950s featured quite [[limited animation]] styles, highlighted by the work of [[Jay Ward]] on ''[[Crusader Rabbit]]''.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=234}} [[Chuck Jones]] coined the term "illustrated radio" to refer to the shoddy style of most television cartoons that depended more on their soundtracks than visuals.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=231}} Other notable 1950s programs include [[United Productions of America|UPA]]'s ''[[Gerald McBoing Boing]]'',{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|pp=131–132}} [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s ''[[Huckleberry Hound]]'' and ''[[Quick Draw McGraw]]'',{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=234}} and rebroadcast of many classic theatrical cartoons from [[Universal Studios|Universal]]'s [[Walter Lantz]], [[Warner Bros.]], [[MGM]], and [[Disney]].

The Hanna-Barbera cartoon, ''[[The Flintstones]]'', was the first successful [[primetime]] animated series in the United States, running from 1960 to 1966 (and in [[reruns]] since).{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=235}} While many networks followed the show's success by scheduling other cartoons in the early 1960s, including ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]'', ''[[The Jetsons]]'', ''[[Top Cat]]'', and ''[[The Alvin Show]]'', none of these programs survived more than a year (save Scooby-Doo, which, despite not being a primetime cartoon, has managed to stay afloat for over four decades). However, networks found success by running these shows as [[Saturday morning cartoons]], reaching smaller audiences with more demographic unity among children. Television animation for children flourished on Saturday morning, on cable channels like [[Nickelodeon]], [[Disney Channel]]/[[Disney XD]] and [[Cartoon Network]], [[PBS Kids]], and in syndicated afternoon timeslots.

The scheduling constraints of the TV animation process, notably issues of resource management, led to the development of various techniques known now as [[limited animation]]. Full-frame animation ("on ones") became rare in its use outside of theatrical productions in the United States.

Primetime cartoons for mature audiences were virtually non-existent in the mainstream of the United States until the 1990s hit, when ''[[The Simpsons]]'' ushered in a new era of [[adult animation]]. Now, "adult animation" programs, such as, ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[King of the Hill]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'' and ''[[Futurama]]'' have increased the number of animated sitcoms on prime-time and evening American television. In addition, animated works from other countries (notably Japan) have had varying levels of airplay in the United States since the 1960s.

===Commercial animation===
Animation has been very popular in television commercials, both due to its graphic appeal, and the humour it can provide. Some animated characters in commercials have survived for decades, such as [[Snap, Crackle and Pop]] in advertisements for Kellogg's cereals.

The legendary animation director [[Tex Avery]] was the producer of the first [[Raid (insecticide)|Raid]] "[[Kills Bugs Dead]]" commercials in 1966, which were very successful for the company. The concept has been used in many countries since.

An '''arts district''' is a demarcated urban area, usually on the periphery of a [[city centre]], intended to create a 'critical mass' of places of cultural consumption - such as [[Art gallery|art galleries]], [[Nightclub|dance club]]s, [[Theater (structure)|theatre]]s, [[art cinema]]s, music venues, and public squares for performances. Such an area is usually encouraged by public policy-making and planning, but sometimes occurs spontaneously. It is associated with allied service-industry jobs like cafes, printers, fashion outlets, restaurants, and a variety of 'discreet services' (see the back-page small-ads of almost any cultural events-listings magazine).

There may also be some artists' studios located in nearby back-streets. But, as [[Richard Florida]] has found from his research, cultural production facilities are often better sited some miles away from cultural consumption facilities - except in some very tolerant cities and in countries where a boisterous alcohol-based nightlife scene does not lead to aggressive and anti-social behaviour.

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] the term sometimes used is "Cultural quarter" or "Arts quarter".

== Types of Arts Districts ==
Steiner and Butler outline five types of arts districts commonly found in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steiner|first=Frederick|title=Planning and Urban Design Standards|year=2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-471-76090-0|page=242|author2=Kent Butler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Cultural compounds - tend to be the oldest art districts often established in cities before the 1930s.  These tend to be well-known art districts engrained into the mentality and culture of a community or nation.
# Major Cultural Institutions - large institutions that serve as anchors for an arts district such as large concert halls, playhouses, libraries, or museums.
# Arts and entertainment centers - focus primarily on smaller, popular attractions such as small theaters, private galleries, restaurants, and other entertainment that often has a more bohemian feel than larger more established districts.
# Downtown Arts Districts - occasionally art districts encompass an entire downtown and especially when tourism and walk-ability is the focus of downtown.
# Cultural Production Districts - cultural production districts are characterized by production spaces such as specialized studios, arts centers, and media facilities.  These areas are often tied to affordable studio housing for artists and prioritize the cultural life of the neighborhood.

Mario Raimondo, known as '''Barbadirame''', was an [[Italy|Italian]] artist.

==Life==
Barbadirame was a close associate of [[Pablo Picasso]] from when the pair first met in the 1950s until Picasso’s death in 1973. Speaking about Barbadirame in 1963 Pablo Picasso said: “To speak about young painters it is not my habit. The Italian painter ‘Raimondo' known as ‘Barbadirame', is a true painter, serious, like the workers of his earth. He implements his works decisively and with simplicity. The stone walls, the mediterranean olive trees, all have the same humanity of their agriculturists, the eternity. He is an artist that counts”.

Mario Raimondo was born in [[Dolceacqua]], Italy, in 1923. He began his professional life as a decorator, painting numerous frescoes in private residences and castles while wandering the [[Riviera dei Fiori]] and the [[Costa Azzurra]]. Barbadirame was a complete artist, equally at home in different mediums. A painter and a sculptor, one of his most famed sculptures is the huge statue he created, in collaboration with Mario Agrifoglio, in honor of  the astronomer [[Gian Domenico Cassini]] (1625–1712).

During his life Barbadirame’s exhibitions were attended by celebrities  including [[Jean Cocteau]], Picasso, [[Grace Kelly]] and her husband, the prince of Monaco. Towards the end of his career, Barbardirame received  the Biamonti Prize, a prize for art and literature portraying the true essence of Italy’s Liguria region. The prize was named after [[Francesco Biamonti]] (1933–2001), a celebrated Italian novelist from Liguria.  Biamonti himself wrote of Barbardirame’s work: “His peasants, his women, his Christs have lost every crudeness, without losing the truth of their solidity…” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sanremobuonenotizie.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1256:dolceacqua-in-lutto-per-la-scomparsa-del-maestro-barbadirame&amp;catid=96:imperiese&amp;Itemid=320&amp;lang=it |title=All'artista Barbadirame la gratitudine di Dolceacqua|author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Bloor Street Culture Corridor'''  is a cluster of arts and cultural organizations in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada. It is located on [[Bloor Street|Bloor St. W]], between [[Bathurst Street (Toronto)|Bathurst]] and [[Bay Street|Bay]] Streets.

The Bloor Street Culture Corridor has a wide variety of art genres, from museum experiences to films, art exhibitions to music concerts. The area also is culturally diverse, including Aboriginal, French, Jewish, Italian, Japanese, Estonian, African and Caribbean arts and culture.

Officially launched in April 2014,&lt;ref name="star-ann"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2014/03/27/twelve_bloor_st_arts_institutions_form_new_culture_corridor.html|title=Twelve Bloor St. arts institutions form new 'Culture Corridor'|author=Eastwood, Joel|date=27 March 2014|publisher=Toronto Star|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the collective shares a website, [[social media]] and a [[mobile app]] to promote exhibitions at its member institutions. In 2016, the Corridor was successful in working with the [[City of Toronto]] to have the section of Bloor St. West designated an official City of Toronto cultural corridor. Each year more than three million persons visit the Corridor's arts and culture destinations, and attend exhibitions, performances, and events. Together, the Bloor St. Culture Corridor organizations employ more than 5,500 culture workers and generate more than $629,500,000 in economic impact each year.

'''Ceramic glaze''' is an impervious layer or coating of a [[vitreous enamel|vitreous]] substance which has been fused to a [[ceramic]] body through firing. Glaze can serve to color, decorate or waterproof an item.&lt;ref name="Division"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Statistics of U.S. Businesses Main Page|url = https://www.census.gov/econ/susb/index.html|website = www.census.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-27|language = EN-US|first = Company Statistics|last = Division|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151126030511/http://www.census.gov/econ/susb/index.html|archive-date = 2015-11-26|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Glazing renders [[earthenware]] vessels suitable for holding liquids, sealing the inherent [[porosity]] of unglazed [[biscuit (pottery)|biscuit]] earthenware. It also gives a tougher surface. Glaze is also used on [[stoneware]] and [[porcelain]]. In addition to their functionality, glazes can form a variety of surface finishes, including degrees of glossy or matte finish and color. Glazes may also enhance the underlying design or texture either unmodified or inscribed, carved or painted.

Most [[pottery]] produced in recent centuries has been glazed, other than pieces in unglazed [[terracotta]], [[biscuit porcelain]] or some other types. [[Tile]]s are almost always glazed on the surface face, and modern [[architectural terracotta]] is very often [[glazed architectural terra-cotta|glazed]].  Glazed brick is also common.  Domestic sanitary ware is invariably glazed, as are many ceramics used in industry, for example ceramic insulators for [[overhead power line]]s.

The most important groups of traditional glazes, named after their main [[ceramic flux]]ing agent, are:

*[[Lead-glazed earthenware]], is shiny and transparent after firing, which needs only about {{convert|800|C}}.  It has been used for about 2,000 years around the Mediterranean, in Europe, and China. It includes ''[[sancai]]'' and [[Victorian majolica]].
*[[Tin-glazed pottery]], which coats the ware with an opaque white glaze. Known in the [[Ancient Near East]] and then important in [[Islamic pottery]], from which it passed to Europe. Includes [[faience]], [[maiolica]], [[majolica]] and [[Delftware]].   
*[[Salt glaze pottery|Salt-glazed ware]], mostly European stoneware. It uses ordinary salt.
*[[Ash glaze]], important in East Asia, simply made from wood or plant ash, which contains [[potash]] and [[Lime (material)|lime]]. 
*[[Feldspath]]ic glazes of porcelain.

Modern [[materials technology]] has invented new vitreous glazes that do not fall into these traditional categories.

==Composition==
Glazes need to include a [[ceramic flux]] which functions by promoting partial liquefaction in the clay bodies and the other glaze materials. Fluxes lower the high melting point of the glass formers [[silica]], and sometimes [[boron trioxide]].  These glass formers may be included in the glaze materials, or may be drawn from the clay beneath. 
 
Raw materials of ceramic glazes generally include silica, which will be the main glass former. Various metal oxides, such as [[sodium]], [[potassium]], and [[calcium]], act as [[ceramic flux|flux]] and therefore lower the melting temperature. [[Alumina]], often derived from [[clay]], stiffens the molten glaze to prevent it from running off the piece.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_CsrDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA694&amp;dq=%C2%A0Raw+materials+of+ceramic+glazes+generally+include+silica,+which+will+be+the+main+glass+forme#v=onepage&amp;q=%C2%A0Raw%20materials%20of%20ceramic%20glazes%20generally%20include%20silica,%20which%20will%20be%20the%20main%20glass%20forme&amp;f=false|title=S.Chands Success Guide (Q&amp;A) Inorganic Chemistry|last=Madan|first=Gaurav|date=2005|publisher=S. Chand Publishing|isbn=9788121918572|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colorants, such as [[iron oxide]], [[Basic copper carbonate|copper carbonate]], or [[cobalt carbonate]],&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and sometimes opacifiers like [[tin oxide]] or [[zirconium oxide]], are used to modify the visual appearance of the fired glaze.

==Process==
[[File:Enderun library Topkapi 42.JPG|thumb|[[İznik tiles]] in the [[Enderûn Library]], [[Topkapi Palace]], [[Istanbul]]]]
Glaze may be applied by dry-dusting a dry mixture over the surface of the clay body or by inserting salt or soda into the kiln at high temperatures to create an atmosphere rich in sodium vapor that interacts with the aluminium and silica oxides in the body to form and deposit glass, producing what is known as [[salt glaze pottery]]. Most commonly, glazes in aqueous suspension of various powdered [[mineral]]s and metal [[oxide]]s are applied by dipping pieces directly into the glaze. Other techniques include pouring the glaze over the piece, spraying it onto the piece with an [[airbrush]] or similar tool, or applying it directly with a brush or other tool.

To prevent the glazed article from sticking to the [[kiln]] during firing, either a small part of the item is left unglazed, or it's supported on small refractory supports such as [[kiln spurs]] and [[Stilt (ceramics)|Stilt]]s that are removed and discarded after the firing. Small marks left by these spurs are sometimes visible on finished ware.

Decoration applied under the glaze on pottery is generally referred to as [[underglaze]]. Underglazes are applied to the surface of the pottery, which can be either raw, "greenware", or "[[Bisque (pottery)|biscuit]]"-fired (an initial firing of some articles before the glazing and re-firing).&lt;ref&gt;"Cleaning Biscuit Fired Ceramic Ware" Hulse D.K, Barnett W.C.

Ceram. Inf.(Spain) 20, No.202. 1994. Pg. 25–27&lt;/ref&gt; A wet glaze—usually transparent—is applied over the decoration. The pigment fuses with the glaze, and appears to be underneath a layer of clear glaze. An example of underglaze decoration is the well-known "[[Blue and white porcelain|blue and white]]" [[porcelain]] famously produced in [[Spode|England]], [[Delftware|the Netherlands]], China, and [[Imari porcelain|Japan]]. The striking blue color uses [[Cobalt blue|cobalt]] as cobalt oxide or cobalt carbonate.&lt;ref&gt;'Ceramics Glaze Technology.' J.R.Taylor &amp; A.C.Bull. ''The Institute Of Ceramics &amp; Pergamon Press.'' Oxford. 1986&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Polychrome glazed pottery statue of heavenly guardian.jpg|thumb|[[Sancai]] lead-glazed figure of heavenly guardian, [[Tang dynasty]]]]

Decoration applied on top of a layer of glaze is referred to as [[overglaze]]. Overglaze methods include applying one or more layers or coats of glaze on a piece of [[pottery]] or by applying a non-glaze substance such as [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] or metals (e.g., [[gold leaf]]) over the glaze.

Overglaze colors are low-temperature glazes that give ceramics a more decorative, glassy look. A piece is fired first, this initial firing being called the '''glost firing''', then the overglaze decoration is applied, and it is fired again. Once the piece is fired and comes out of the kiln, its texture is smoother due to the glaze.

==History==
Historically, glazing of ceramics developed rather slowly, as appropriate materials needed to be discovered, and also firing technology able to reliably reach the necessary temperatures was needed.

Glazed brick goes back to the [[Elam]]ite Temple at [[Chogha Zanbil]], dated to the 13th century BC.  The [[Iron Pagoda]], built in 1049 in [[Kaifeng]], [[China]], of glazed bricks is a well-known later example.&lt;ref name="gao"&gt;{{cite book

Lead glazed earthenware was probably made in China during the Warring States Period (475 – 221 BCE), and its production increased during the Han Dynasty. High temperature proto-celadon glazed stoneware was made earlier than glazed earthenware, since the Shang Dynasty (1600 – 1046 BCE).  &lt;ref name="Zhiyan"&gt;{{cite book

During the [[Kofun period]] of Japan, [[Sue ware]] was decorated with greenish natural [[ash glaze]]s. From 552 to 794 AD, differently colored glazes were introduced. The three colored glazes of the [[Tang Dynasty]] were frequently used for a period, but were gradually phased out; the precise colors and compositions of the glazes have not been recovered. Natural ash glaze, however, was commonly used throughout the country.

In the 13th century, flower designs were painted with red, blue, green, yellow and black overglazes. Overglazes became very popular because of the particular look they gave [[Ceramic art|ceramics]].

From the eighth century, the use of glazed ceramics was prevalent in [[Islamic art]] and [[Islamic pottery]], usually in the form of elaborate [[pottery]].&lt;ref name="Environment"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)|url = https://www.environment.gov.au/protection/publications/factsheet-nitrogen-dioxide-no2|website = www.environment.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-11-09|first = Department of the|last = Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tin-glazing|Tin-opacified glazing]] was one of the earliest new technologies developed by the Islamic potters. The first Islamic opaque glazes can be found as blue-painted ware in [[Basra]], dating to around the 8th century. Another significant contribution was the development of [[stoneware]], originating from 9th century Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1995), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Other centers for innovative ceramic pottery in the Islamic world included [[Fustat]] (from 975 to 1075), Damascus (from 1100 to around 1600) and [[Tabriz]] (from 1470 to 1550).&lt;ref name="Missoun, F. 2010"&gt;Missoun, F., M.

=== Metal oxide chemistry ===
Metals used in ceramic glazes are typically in the form of metal oxides.

==== Lead(II) oxide ====
Ceramic manufacturers primarily use [[lead(II) oxide]] (PbO) as a flux for its low melting range, wide firing range, low surface tension, high index of refraction, and resistance to [[devitrification]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Lehman, Richard. ''Lead Glazes for Ceramic Foodware''. 1st ed. Research Triangle Park: International Lead Management Center, 2002. [http://www.ilmc.org/Publications/ILMCFinalCombo8-02B.pdf  International Lead Management Center  ]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In polluted environments, [[nitrogen dioxide]] reacts with water ({{chem|H|2|O}}) to produce [[nitrous acid]] ({{chem|HNO|2}}) and [[nitric acid]] ({{chem|HNO|3}}).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{chem|H|2|O}} + 2{{chem|NO|2}} → {{chem|HNO|2}} + {{chem|HNO|3}}

Soluble [[Lead(II) nitrate]] ({{chem|Pb(NO|3|)|2}}) forms when lead(II) oxide (PbO) of leaded glazes is exposed to [[nitric acid]] ({{chem|HNO|3}}) 

PbO + 2{{chem|HNO|3}} → {{chem|Pb(NO|3|)|2}} + {{chem|H|2|O}}

Because lead exposure is strongly linked to a variety of health problems, collectively referred to as [[lead poisoning]], the disposal of leaded glass (chiefly in the form of discarded CRT displays) and lead-glazed ceramics is subject to [[toxic waste]] regulations.

==== Chromium(III) oxide ====
[[Chromium(III) oxide]] ({{chem|Cr|2|O|3}}) is used as a colorant in ceramic glazes. Chromium(III) oxide can undergo a reaction with [[calcium oxide]] (CaO) and atmospheric oxygen in temperatures reached by a kiln to produce [[calcium chromate]] ({{chem|CaCrO|4}}). The oxidation reaction changes chromium from its +3 [[oxidation state]] to its +6 oxidation state.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Heating Temperature Dependence of Cr(III) Oxidation in the Presence of Alkali and Alkaline Earth Salts and Subsequent Cr(VI) Leaching Behavior|journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology|date = 2013-06-04|issn = 0013-936X|pages = 5858–5863|volume = 47|issue = 11|doi = 10.1021/es4001455|pmid = 23635007|first = Bram|last = Verbinnen|first2 = Pieter|last2 = Billen|first3 = Michiel|last3 = Van Coninckxloo|first4 = Carlo|last4 = Vandecasteele}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chromium(VI) is very soluble and the most mobile out of all the other stable forms of chromium.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Chromium as an Environmental Pollutant: Insights on Induced Plant Toxicity|journal = Journal of Botany|date = 2012-05-20|pages = 1–8|volume = 2012|doi = 10.1155/2012/375843|first = Helena|last = Oliveira}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chromium may enter water systems via industrial discharge. Chromium(VI) can enter the environment directly or oxidants present in soils can react with chromium(III) to produce chromium(VI). Plants have reduced amounts of chlorophyll when grown in the presence of chromium(VI).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Prevention ===
Chromium oxidation during manufacturing processes can be reduced with the introduction of compounds that bind to calcium.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Ceramic industries are reluctant to use lead alternatives since leaded glazes provide products with a brilliant shine and smooth surface. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has experimented with a dual glaze, barium alternative to lead, but they were unsuccessful in achieving the same optical effect as leaded glazes.

{{Paranormal}}
The '''chupacabra''' or '''chupacabras''' ({{IPA-es|tʃupaˈkaβɾas}}, literally "goat-sucker"; from ''chupar'', "to suck", and ''cabra'', "goat") is a [[legend]]ary creature in the [[folklore]] of parts of the Americas, with its first purported sightings reported in [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name="Latino Bigfoot" /&gt; The name comes from the animal's reported [[Vampirism|habit]] of attacking and [[Hematophagy|drinking the blood]] of [[livestock]], including [[goat]]s.

Physical descriptions of the creature vary. It is purportedly a heavy creature, the size of a small bear, with a row of spines reaching from the neck to the base of the tail.

Eyewitness sightings have been claimed in Puerto Rico, and have since been reported as far north as [[Maine]], and as far south as [[Chile]], and even being spotted outside the Americas in countries like [[Russia]] and the [[Philippines]], but many of the reports have been disregarded as uncorroborated or lacking evidence. Sightings in northern Mexico and the southern United States have been verified as [[Canidae|canids]] afflicted by [[mange]].&lt;ref name="Radford2011"&gt;{{cite book |last=Radford |first=Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Radford |year=2011 |title=[[Tracking the Chupacabra]]: The Vampire Beast in Fact, Fiction and Folklore |isbn=978-0-8263-5015-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to biologists and wildlife management officials, the chupacabra is an [[urban legend]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corp.primerahora.com/archivo.asp?guid=3283EF0636144DD6AAC744E6D18C3E66&amp;year=2002&amp;keyword= |title=Disfrazado el chupacabras |trans-title= |date=24 September 2002 |last=González Rodríguez |first=Miried |website=[[Primera Hora (Puerto Rico)|Primera Hora]] |location=Puerto Rico |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==
''Chupacabras'' can be literally translated as "goat-sucker", from ''chupar'' ("to suck") and ''cabra'' ("goat"). It is known as both ''chupacabras'' and ''chupacabra'' throughout the Americas, with the former being the original word,&lt;ref name="Clave"&gt;Diccionario Clave, [http://clave.librosvivos.net/verficha.asp?idelementoaver=42243&amp;cadena=chupacabras chupacabras] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000326/http://clave.librosvivos.net/verficha.asp?idelementoaver=42243&amp;cadena=chupacabras |date=4 March 2016 }}. It states that both singular and plural is ''chupacabras''.&lt;/ref&gt; and the latter a [[regularization (linguistics)|regularization]] of it.  The name is attributed to Puerto Rican comedian [[Silverio Pérez]], who coined the label in 1995 while commenting on the attacks as a San Juan radio deejay.&lt;ref name="Pérez2000"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pérez |first=Silverio |author-link=Silverio Pérez |title=Más humortivación: para el camino del éxito |trans-title=More Humortivation: The Path for Success |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG3wb8qOgt8C |year=2000 |publisher=Dreams Come True |isbn=978-0-9702011-0-2 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bradford2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/was_the_nightjar_an_early_chupacabra/ |title=Was the Nightjar an Early Chupacabra? |last=Radford |first=Benjamin |author-link=Benjamin Radford |date=1 June 2017 |website=Center for Inquiry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first reported attack eventually attributed to the creatures occurred in March 1995 in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="trail"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://paranormal.about.com/library/weekly/aa051898.htm |title=On the trail of the Chupacabras |last=Wagner |first=Stephen |year=1998 |website=[[About.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050919215215/http://paranormal.about.com/library/weekly/aa051898.htm |archive-date=19 September 2005 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight [[domestic sheep|sheep]] were discovered dead, each with three puncture wounds in the chest area and completely drained of blood.&lt;ref name="trail" /&gt; A few months later, in August, an eyewitness, Madelyne Tolentino, reported seeing the creature in the Puerto Rican town of [[Canóvanas, Puerto Rico|Canóvanas]], when as many as 150 farm animals and pets were reportedly killed.&lt;ref name="trail" /&gt; In 1975, similar killings in the small town of [[Moca, Puerto Rico|Moca]] were attributed to ''El Vampiro de Moca'' ("The Vampire of Moca").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://paranormal.about.com/cs/chupacabra/a/aa071403.htm |title=Encounters with Chupacabras |year=2000 |last=Wagner |first=Stephen |website=[[About.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017163054/http://paranormal.about.com/cs/chupacabra/a/aa071403.htm |archive-date=17 October 2007 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, it was suspected that the killings were committed by a [[Satanism|Satanic]] [[cult]]; later more killings were reported around the island, and many farms reported loss of animal life. Each of the animals was reported to have had its body bled dry through a series of small circular incisions.

[[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] comedian and entrepreneur [[Silverio Pérez]] is credited with coining the term ''chupacabras'' soon after the first incidents were reported in the press. Shortly after the first reported incidents in Puerto Rico, other animal deaths were reported in other countries, such as the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], Chile, [[Colombia]], [[Honduras]], [[El Salvador]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Panama]], [[Peru]], [[Brazil]], United States, and [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="trail" /&gt;

== Reputed origin ==
A five-year investigation by [[Benjamin Radford]], documented in his 2011 book ''[[Tracking the Chupacabra]]'', concluded that the description given by the original eyewitness in Puerto Rico, Madelyne Tolentino, was based on the creature Sil in the science-fiction horror film ''[[Species (film)|Species]]''.&lt;ref name="Radford2011" /&gt; The alien creature Sil is nearly identical to Tolentino’s chupacabra eyewitness account and she had seen the movie before her report: "It was a creature that looked like the chupacabra, with spines on its back and all... The resemblance to the chupacabra was really impressive," Tolentino reported.&lt;ref&gt;Corrales, Scott. Chupacabras: And Other Mysteries. {{ISBN|1-883729-06-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radford revealed that Tolentino "believed that the creatures and events she saw in ''Species'' were happening in reality in Puerto Rico at the time," and therefore concludes that "the most important chupacabra description cannot be trusted."&lt;ref name="Radford2011" /&gt; This, Radford believes, seriously undermines the credibility of the chupacabra as a real animal.&lt;ref&gt;Radford, Benjamin. "Slaying the Vampire: Solving the ''Chupacabra'' Mystery" ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'', Vol. 35 No. 3, May/June 2011, Pages 45–48&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the reports of blood-sucking by the chupacabra were never confirmed by a [[necropsy]],&lt;ref name="Radford2011" /&gt; the only way to conclude that the animal was drained of blood. An analysis by a veterinarian of 300 reported victims of the chupacabra found that they had not been bled dry.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

Radford divided the chupacabra reports into two categories: the reports from [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Latin America]] where animals were attacked and it is supposed their blood was extracted, and the reports in the United States of [[mammal]]s, mostly dogs and [[coyote]]s with [[mange]], that people call "chupacabra" due to their unusual appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chupacabra Science: How Evolution Made a Mythical Monster |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/10/101028-chupacabra-evolution-halloween-science-monsters-chupacabras-picture/ |date=28 October 2010 |last=Than |first=Ker |work=National Geographic |publisher=National Geographic Society |accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late October 2010, [[University of Michigan]] biologist Barry O'Connor concluded that all the chupacabra reports in the United States were simply coyotes infected with the parasite ''[[Sarcoptes scabiei]]'', whose symptoms would explain most of the features of the chupacabra: they would be left with little fur, thickened skin, and rank odor. O'Connor theorized that the attacks on goats occurred "because these animals are greatly weakened, they're going to have a hard time hunting. So they may be forced into attacking livestock because it's easier than running down a rabbit or a deer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ur.umich.edu/1011/Oct25_10/1698-scary-chupacabras-monster |date=25 October 2010 |title=Scary chupacabras monster is as much victim as villain |last=Ross-Flannigan |first=Nancy |website=The University Record |publisher=University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although several witnesses came to the conclusion that the attacks could not be the work of dogs or coyotes because they had not eaten the victim, this conclusion is incorrect.&lt;ref name="Radford2011" /&gt; Both dogs and coyotes can kill and not consume the prey, either because they are inexperienced, or due to injury or difficulty in killing the prey.&lt;ref name="Radford2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wade and Bowns"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://texnat.tamu.edu/about/procedures-for-evaluating/evaluation-of-suspected-predator-kills/ |title=Evaluation of Suspected Predator Kills |date=May 2010 |last1=Wade |first1=Dale A. |last2=Bowns |first2=James E. |website=Texas AgriLife Research and Extension Center | |publisher=[[Texas A&amp;M University]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101055717/http://texnat.tamu.edu/about/procedures-for-evaluating/evaluation-of-suspected-predator-kills/ |archivedate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prey can survive the attack and die afterwards from internal [[bleeding]] or [[circulatory shock]].&lt;ref name="Radford2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wade and Bowns" /&gt; The presence of two holes in the neck, corresponding with the [[canine teeth]], are to be expected since this is the only way that most land [[carnivores]] have to catch their prey.&lt;ref name="Radford2011" /&gt;

There are reports of stray [[Mexican Hairless Dog]]s being mistaken for chupacabras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/offbeat/2009/09/01/roldan.chupacabra.KSAT?iref=videosearch |title=Breaking News Videos, Story Video and Show Clips – CNN.com |date=12 March 2014 |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==
The most common description of the chupacabra is that of a [[reptile]]-like creature, said to have leathery or scaly greenish-gray skin and sharp spines or quills running down its back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://skepdic.com/chupa.html |title=Chupacabra |last=Carroll |first=Robert Todd |authorlink=Robert Todd Carroll |date=29 October 2015 |website=The Skeptic's Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said to be approximately {{convert|3|to|4|ft|1}} high, and stands and hops in a fashion similar to that of a [[kangaroo]].&lt;ref name="top ten"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/most-mysterious-creatures-of-modern-times-2594695 |title=The Top 10 Most Mysterious Creatures of Modern Times |last=Wagner |first=Stephen |date=8 September 2017 |website=ThoughtCo |publisher=[[Dotdash]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common description of the chupacabra is of a strange breed of wild dog. This form is mostly hairless and has a pronounced spinal ridge, unusually pronounced eye sockets, fangs, and claws. Unlike conventional predators, the chupacabra is said to drain all of the animal's blood (and sometimes organs) usually through three holes in the shape of a downwards-pointing triangle or through one or two holes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vocero.com/noticias.asp?s=Locales&amp;n=23285 |last=De Jesús Mangual |first=Tomás |author-link=Tomás de Jesús Mangual |date=9 January 2006 |title=Imputan otro ataque al Chupacabras |website=[[El Vocero]] |location=San Juan, Puerto Rico |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011110443/http://vocero.com/noticias.asp?s=Locales&amp;n=23285 |archive-date=11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related legends ==
A popular legend in [[New Orleans]] concerns a popular lovers' lane called Grunch Road, which was said to be inhabited by "grunches", creatures similar in appearance to the ''Chupacabra''.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

The [[peuchen]]s of Chile also share similarities in their supposed habits, but instead of being dog-like they are described as winged snakes. This legend may have originated from the [[vampire bat]], an animal endemic to the region.&lt;ref name=peuchen1&gt;[https://archive.is/20070619191305/http://www.diarioelcentro.cl/articulos_sc.php?fecha=26-07-2004&amp;semana=29-2004 Article: Tras los pasos del chupacabras. El centro, Journal. 26-07-2004 {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Philippines, another [[legendary creature]] called the [[Sigbin]] shares many of chupacabra's descriptions.

&lt;!-- ATTENTION: Long lists of your favorite TV show featuring a chupacabra aren't needed, thanks!--&gt;
The popularity of the chupacabra has resulted in its being featured in many types of media.
* At least one published mystery novel uses aspects of the myth as the centerpoint of the plot.&lt;ref name="Wagner2004"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wagner |first=Lloyd |title=El Chupacabras: Trail of the Goatsucker |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ejeE4_e_mQQC |date=October 2004 |publisher=iUniverse |isbn=978-0-595-33315-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other kinds of books include those that provide a scientific explanation for the phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Corrales, Scott.

* The chupacabra has appeared in various science fiction and [[monster movie]]s, including ''[[Chupacabra: Dark Seas]]'', starring [[John Rhys-Davies]], and ''[[Guns of El Chupacabra]]'', starring [[Scott Shaw]]. In 2014, the found-footage horror film [[Indigenous (film)|''Indigenous'']], involving friends vacation in Panama who find themselves being hunted by a pack of Chupacabra, was released.
* [[CNN]]'s Ed Lavandera has described the chupacabra as the "[[Bigfoot]] of [[Latin American culture|Latino culture]]" and has stated that "El Chupacabra also symbolizes the fear of something that doesn't exist".&lt;ref name="Latino Bigfoot"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0605/02/lt.01.html |title=Illegal Immigrants Frightened by Raid Rumors; George Bush: "The Decider"; "Happy Slapping" |publisher=CNN |date=2 May 2006 |accessdate=5 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the incident in [[Cuero, Texas]], the popularity of the chupacabra myth was receiving global attention.&lt;ref name="craze"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kvue.com/news/top/stories/082807kvuechupacabracraze-cb.7c603ee0.html |title=Chupacabra craze goes global |publisher=KVUE |date=28 August 2007 |accessdate=5 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204230222/http://www.kvue.com/news/top/stories/082807kvuechupacabracraze-cb.7c603ee0.html |archivedate=4 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phylis Canion, who was responsible for capturing the alleged specimen, claimed that T-shirts highlighting the event were shipped to locations such as Italy, [[Guam]], and Iraq. The publicity that Cuero received following this event has led to some suggesting changing the town's mascot.&lt;ref name="craze" /&gt; In July 2008, [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]]'s ''[[Monster Quest]]'' series featured the Texas carcasses, which were determined to be dogs and coyotes.&lt;ref name="Monsterquest"&gt;{{cite web |title=Video – MonsterQuest |url=http://css.history.com/shows/monsterquest/videos/chupacabra-evidence |website=[[History Channel]] |accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Courtenay Place''' is the main street of the Courtenay Quarter in the [[Wellington]], New Zealand inner-city district of [[Te Aro]].

Courtenay Place is known for its entertainment and nightlife. Many restaurants are open late and most of the bars stay open until dawn. It contains offices, accommodation, tourist shopping, entertainment, food, art and buskers offering many genres of free performance. Pedestrian traffic is substantial around the clock.

== Early development ==
[[File:Courtenay Place, circa 1900 (4839950942).jpg|alt=A black and white photo of the view east down Courtenay Place, around 1900|left|thumb|The view east down Courtenay Place, around 1900]]
The first building of any importance in Courtenay Place was built shortly after 1900 by local butcher and businessman, [[John William Rod (New Zealand)|John Rod]] JP.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, ''Evening Post'',13 Jan 1920.&lt;/ref&gt; It is now a heritage listed building, originally designed by T S Lambert, situated on the eastern corner of Allen Street and Courtenay Place. Of brick construction, it originally had three stories and a large cellar, with stables at the rear (now 23 Allen street).&lt;ref&gt;Original Plans held by Wellington City Archives&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been reduced to two stories, probably due to earthquake damage. In 2015, the ground floor and cellars accommodate a bar and restaurant.

==The arts==

Every two years Courtenay Place is home to many of the [[New Zealand International Arts Festival]] events.

'''[[Bats Theatre]]''' is a venue for the development of new theatre practitioners and plays.

'''[[Downstage Theatre]]''', founded in 1964, is New Zealand's first professional theatre.

'''[[Embassy Theatre (Wellington)|Embassy Theatre]]''' ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' movie ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'' had its world premiere at the Embassy Theatre at the head of Courtenay Place. The movies ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' both had their [[Australasia]]n premiere at the Embassy (Event Slide Shows). Both events were broadcast live to the world for many hours, involving the movement of record amounts of data by [[CityLink Limited|CityLink]]. The theatre is on the Wellington City Council's heritage list in the District Plan. [[Heritage New Zealand]] has recognised its heritage values with Category One registration, indicating a place of 'special or outstanding historical or cultural heritage significance or value'. It was originally known as the 'De Luxe' and was built in 1924. Designed by Llewellyn Williams and constructed of reinforced concrete, it included classical external and internal architectural details. The name changed to the Embassy in 1945. A long list of theatre identities has been associated with the theatre, including [[William Kemball]], who formed the [[De Luxe Theatre Company]] in 1923, and [[Sir Robert Kerridge]]. [[Kerry Robins]], leaseholder of the Paramount Theatre in Wellington, took over the lease of the Embassy in 1996. It was purchased by the [[Embassy Theatre Trust]] in 1997 with financial underwriting of the refurbishment programme by Wellington City Council. Ownership was transferred to the WCC under the terms of the agreement. Embassy Theatre Trust subsidiary Company Financial report: Audit report In October 2005 Wellington film exhibitor Kerry Robins sold the operational management of the Embassy to Village SkyCity Cinemas.

'''Paramount Theatre''' (no longer operational) is the oldest surviving cinema in Wellington, still with its original name. Originally a part of Te Aro beach, in August 1916 the location of the Paramount was purchased by [[John James Williamson]]. He arranged for architect [[James Bennie]] to design a picture house.

'''Reading Courtenay Central Complex''' contains shops, restaurants and a ten-screen multiplex cinema. The 8,000 m² development links Courtenay Place with the waterfront and was designed to complement the existing character of the strip. This project won the 2003 Property Council NZ Entertainment Excellence Award.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ignite-direct.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060402210211/http://ignite-direct.com/ |date=2 April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was originally bulldozed in the mid-1980s by [[Chase Corporation]] for the proposed Wakefield Centre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vertical Living: The Architectural Centre and the Remaking of Wellington|author=Julia Gatley, Kunal Hari, Damian Skinner, Justine Clark|page=|year=2014|publisher=Auckland University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after the company fell victim to the [[Black Monday (1987)|1987 sharemarket crash]], the site remained derelict for years until it was purchased by Reading Cinemas. The complex was temporarily shut down for safety reasons, after a large earthquake in late 2016 damaged an adjacent parking building beyond repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/nz-earthquake/88029844/big-bertha-crane-moves-in-for-reading-cinema-car-park-demolition|title='Big Bertha' crane moves in for Reading Cinema car park demolition|date=2016-12-30|publisher=Stuff.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision]]''' (aka NZ Film Archive) is on the corner of Ghuznee St and Taranaki St, a block from Courtenay Place.

'''[[Opera House (Wellington)|The Opera House]]'''

'''[[St James Theatre (Wellington)|St James Theatre]]'''. Formerly His Majesty's (and more recently the Westpac St James Theatre), the St. James was designed for [[John Fuller and Sons Ltd]] by Mr [[Henry Eli White]] Architect, structural engineer and contractor. It was the first steel-framed concrete-coated proscenium-arched theatre in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. The steel frame allowed for an unsupported 80&amp;nbsp;ft (25 m) span roof structure and also provided good resistance to earthquake damage.

In July 2011, Positively Wellington Venues, an integration between the Wellington Convention Centre and the St James Theatre Trust, began managing this theatre as well as The Opera House, Wellington.

There are two other theatres that sit just outside the Courtenay Place district, '''Circa Theatre''' which sits on the waterfront near Te Papa; and '''Capital E''', home of the National Theatre for Children, which is in Civic Square.

==Events==
In 2017, [[TEDxWellington]] hosted 13 speakers and 1,000 delegates at the [[St. James Theatre, Wellington|St. James Theatre]] on Courtenay Place.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/92717745/Hasbro-toy-designer-among-list-of-TEDxWellington-speakers&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30184">The '''creative industries''' refers to a range of economic activities which are concerned with the generation or exploitation of knowledge and information. They may variously also be referred to as the [[cultural industry|cultural industries]] (especially in Europe {{Harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|p=14}} or the creative economy {{harv|Howkins|2001}}, and most recently they have been denominated as the Orange Economy in Latin America and the Caribbean ([http://www.iadb.org/en/publications/publication-detail,7101.html?id=70896 Buitrago &amp; Duque 2013]).

Howkins' creative economy comprises [[advertising]], [[architecture]], [[art]], [[crafts]], [[design]], [[fashion]], [[film industry|film]], [[music industry|music]], [[performing arts]], [[publishing]], [[research and development|R&amp;D]], [[software]], [[toy]]s and [[game]]s, [[Television|TV]] and [[radio]], and [[video game]]s {{harv|Howkins|2001|pp=88–117}}. Some scholars consider that education industry, including public and private services, is forming a part of creative industry.&lt;ref&gt;Kultur &amp; Kommunikation for Nordic Innovation Centre (2007), [http://www.nordicinnovation.org/Global/_Publications/Reports/2008/Creative%20Industries%20education%20in%20the%20Nordic%20countries%20-%20A%20brief%20portrait.pdf "Creative Industries Education in the Nordic Countries"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518105107/http://www.nordicinnovation.org/Global/_Publications/Reports/2008/Creative%20Industries%20education%20in%20the%20Nordic%20countries%20-%20A%20brief%20portrait.pdf |date=2015-05-18 }}; Mœglin, Pierre (2001), Les Industries éducatives, Paris, Puf&lt;/ref&gt; There remain, therefore, different definitions of the sector {{Harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|p=12}}{{harv| DCMS| 2006}}.

The creative industries have been seen to become increasingly important to economic well-being, proponents suggesting that "[[human creativity]] is the ultimate economic resource" {{Harvard citation|Florida|2002|p=xiii}}, and that "the industries of the twenty-first century will depend increasingly on the generation of knowledge through creativity and innovation" {{Harv|Landry|Bianchini|1995|p=4}}.

==Definitions==
Various commentators have provided varying suggestions on what activities to include in the concept of "creative industries" {{harv|DCMS|2001|p=04}}{{harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|p=12}}{{harv|Howkins|2001|pp=88–117}}{{Harv|UNCTAD|2008|pp=11–12}}, and the name itself has become a contested issue – with significant differences and overlap between the terms "creative industries", "cultural industries" and "creative economy" {{Harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|pp=11–14}}{{Harv|UNCTAD|2008|p=12}}.

Lash and Urry suggest that each of the creative industries has an "irreducible core" concerned with "the exchange of finance for rights in [[intellectual property]]", {{harv|Lash|Urry|1994|p=117}}. This echoes the [[United Kingdom|UK]] Government [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] (DCMS) definition which describes the creative industries as:

:"those industries which have their origin in individual creativity, skill and talent and which have a potential for wealth and job creation through the generation and exploitation of intellectual property" {{harv|DCMS|2001|p=04}}

{{As of | 2015}} the DCMS definition recognizes nine ''creative sectors'', namely:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/394668/Creative_Industries_Economic_Estimates_-_January_2015.pdf|title=Department for Culture, Media &amp; Sport – Creative Industries Economic Estimates January 2015|last1=|first1=|last2=|first2=|date=13 January 2015|website=gov.uk|publisher=|access-date=16 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210124534/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/394668/Creative_Industries_Economic_Estimates_-_January_2015.pdf|archivedate=10 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Advertising]] and [[marketing]]
# [[Architecture]] &lt;!--and [[landscaping]] (e.g. [https://www.salford.gov.uk/d/Development_Prospectus.pdf Development prospectus])--&gt;
# [[Crafts]]
# [[Design]]: [[product design|product]], [[graphic design|graphic]] and [[fashion design]]&lt;!--(see also [[communication design]])--&gt;

# [[Information technology|IT]], [[software engineering|software]] and [[computer services]]
# [[Publishing]]

# [[Music industry|Music]], [[performing arts|performing]] and [[visual arts]]

To this list [[John Howkins]] would add [[toys]] and games, also including the much broader area of [[research and development]] in science and technology {{harv|Howkins|2001|pp=88–117}}. It has also been argued{{by whom|date=June 2013}} that [[gastronomy]] belongs in such a list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://macedefence.wordpress.com/2011/05/18/does-cuisine-have-a-place-in-the-creative-economy-and-what-role-does-creative-leadership-play-in-its-production/|title=Does cuisine have a place in the Creative Economy and what role does Creative Leadership play in its production?|author=|date=18 May 2011|website=wordpress.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503134414/https://macedefence.wordpress.com/2011/05/18/does-cuisine-have-a-place-in-the-creative-economy-and-what-role-does-creative-leadership-play-in-its-production/|archivedate=3 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The various fields of [[engineering]] do not appear on this list, that emerged from the DCMS reports. This was due, probably, to the fact that engineers occupy relevant positions in "non-cultural" corporations, performing activities of project, management, operation, maintenance, risk analysis and supervision, among others. However, historically and presently, several tasks of engineers can be regarded as highly creative, inventive and innovative. The contribution of engineering is represented by new products, processes and services.

Hesmondhalgh reduces the list to what he terms "the core cultural industries" of [[advertising]] and marketing, [[broadcasting]], [[Film industry|film]], internet and [[Music industry|music]] industries, [[publishing|print]] and [[electronic publishing]], and [[computer games|video and computer games]]. His definition only includes those industries that create "texts"' or "cultural artefacts" and which engage in some form of industrial reproduction {{Harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|pp=12–14}}.

The DCMS list has proven influential, and many other nations{{which|date=June 2013}} have formally adopted it. It has also been criticised. It has been argued{{by whom|date=June 2013}} that the division into sectors obscures a divide between [[lifestyle business]], non-profits, and larger businesses, and between those who receive state subsidies (e.g., film) and those who do not (e.g., computer games). The inclusion of the antiques trade often comes into question, since it does not generally involve production (except of reproductions and fakes). The inclusion of all computer services has also been questioned {{harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|p=13}}.

Some areas, such as [[Hong Kong]], have preferred to shape their policy around a tighter focus on copyright ownership in the [[value chain]]. They adopt the [[WIPO]]'s classifications, which divide up the creative industries according to who owns the copyrights at various stages during the production and distribution of creative content.

The [[Inter-American Development Bank]] (IDB) has denominated them for Latin America and the Caribbean as the Orange Economy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.iadb.org/en/publications/publication-detail,7101.html?id=70896|title=The Orange Economy: An Infinite Opportunity|first1=Buitrago Restrepo, Pedro|last1=Felipe|first2=Duque Márquez,|last2=Iván|date=1 October 2013|website=iadb.org|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110092916/http://www.iadb.org/en/publications/publication-detail,7101.html?id=70896|archivedate=10 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is defined as the "group of linked activities through which ideas are transformed into cultural goods and services whose value is determined by intellectual property."

Others{{who|date=June 2013}} have suggested a distinction between those industries that are open to mass production and distribution (film and video; videogames; broadcasting; publishing), and those that are primarily craft-based and are meant to be consumed in a particular place and moment ([[visual arts]]; [[performing arts]]; cultural heritage).

==How creative workers are counted==
The DCMS classifies enterprises and occupations as creative according to what the enterprise primarily produces, and what the worker primarily does. Thus, a company which produces records would be classified as belonging to the music [[industrial sector]], and a worker who plays piano would be classified as a [[musician]].

The primary purpose of this is to quantify – for example it can be used to count the number of firms, and the number of workers, creatively employed in any given location, and hence to identify places with particularly high concentrations of creative activities.

It leads to some complications which are not immediately obvious. For example, a security guard working for a music company would be classified as a creative employee, although not as creatively occupied.

The total number of creative employees is then calculated as the sum of:

* All workers employed in creative industries, whether or not creatively occupied (e.g. all musicians, security guards, cleaners, accountants, managers, etc. working for a record company)
* All workers that are creatively occupied, and are not employed in creative industries (for example, a piano teacher in a school). This includes people whose second job is creative, for example somebody who does weekend [[Gig (musical performance)|gigs]], writes books, or produces artwork in their spare time

==Properties or characteristics==
[[File:Township Cat.JPG|thumb|200px|A toy cat produced in a South-African township, made from used plastic bags and old wire]]

According to Caves (2000), creative industries are characterized by seven economic properties:

#''Nobody knows principle'': Demand uncertainty exists because the consumers' reaction to a product are neither known beforehand, nor easily understood afterward.
#''Art for art's sake'': Workers care about originality, technical professional skill, harmony, etc. of creative goods and are willing to settle for lower wages than offered by 'humdrum' jobs.
#''Motley crew principle'': For relatively complex creative products (e.g., films), the production requires diversely skilled inputs. Each skilled input must be present and perform at some minimum level to produce a valuable outcome.
#''Infinite variety'': Products are differentiated by quality and uniqueness; each product is a distinct combination of inputs leading to infinite variety options (e.g., works of creative writing, whether poetry, novel, screenplays or otherwise).
#''A list/B list'': Skills are vertically differentiated. Artists are ranked on their skills, originality, and proficiency in creative processes and/or products. Small differences in skills and talent may yield huge differences in (financial) success.
#''Time flies'': When coordinating complex projects with diversely skilled inputs, time is of the essence.
#''Ars longa'': Some creative products have durability aspects that invoke [[copyright]] protection, allowing a creator or performer to collect rents.

The properties described by Caves have been criticized for being too rigid (Towse, 2000). Not all creative workers are purely driven by 'art for art's sake'. The 'ars longa' property also holds for certain noncreative products (i.e., licensed products). The 'time flies' property also holds for large construction projects. Creative industries are therefore not unique, but they score generally higher on these properties relative to non-creative industries.

==Difference from the 'cultural industries'==
There is often a question about the boundaries between creative industries and the similar term of '''[[Cultural industry|cultural industries]]'''. Cultural industries are best described as an adjunct-sector of the creative industries. Cultural industries include industries that focus on [[cultural tourism]] and [[Cultural heritage|heritage]], [[museum]]s and [[Library|libraries]], [[sports]] and [[outdoor activities]], and a variety of 'way of life' activities that arguably range from local pet shows to a host of [[Hobbies|hobbyist]] concerns. Thus cultural industries are more concerned about delivering other kinds of value—including cultural wealth and social wealth—rather than primarily providing monetary value. (See also [[Cultural Institutions Studies|cultural institutions studies]].)

==The creative class==
Some authors, such as the American [[economist]] [[Richard Florida]], argue for a wider focus on the products of [[knowledge workers]], and judge the '[[creative class]]' (his own term) to include nearly all those offering professional knowledge-based services.

===The creative class and diversity===
Florida's focus leads him to pay particular attention to the nature of the creative [[workforce]]. In a study of why particular US cities such as San Francisco seem to attract creative producers, Florida argues that a high proportion of workers from the '[[creative class]]' provide a key input to creative production, which enterprises seek out. He seeks to quantitatively establish the importance of [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] and [[multiculturalism]] in the cities concerned, for example the existence of a significant public gay community, ethnic and religious variety, and tolerance. {{Harvard citation|Florida|2002}}

==Economic contribution==
Globally, Creative Industries excluding software and general scientific [[research and development]] are said to have accounted for around 4% of the world's economic output in 1999, which is the last year for which comprehensive figures are currently available. Estimates of the output corresponding to scientific [[Research and Development]] suggest that an additional 4-9% might be attributable to the sector if its definition is extended to include such activities, though the figures vary significantly between different countries.

Taking the [[United Kingdom|UK]] as an example, in the context of other sectors, the creative industries make a far more significant contribution to output than [[hospitality]] or [[utilities]] and deliver four times the output due to [[agriculture]], [[fisheries]] and [[forestry]]. In terms of employment and depending on the definition of activities included, the sector is a major employer of between 4-6% of the UK's [[working population]], though this is still significantly less than employment due to traditional areas of work such as [[retail]] and [[manufacturing]].

Within the creative industries sector and again taking the UK as an example, the three largest sub-sectors are [[design]], [[publishing]], and [[television]] and [[radio]]. Together these account for around 75% of revenues and 50% of employment.

The complex [[supply chains]] in the creative industries sometimes make it challenging to calculate accurate figures for the [[gross value added]] by each sub-sector. This is particularly the case for the service-focused sub-sectors such as [[advertising]], whereas it is more straightforward in product-focused sub-sectors such as [[crafts]]. Not surprisingly, perhaps, competition in product-focused areas tends to be more intense with a tendency to drive the production end of the supply chain to become a [[commodity business]].

There may be a tendency for publicly funded creative industries development services to inaccurately estimate the number of creative businesses during the mapping process. There is also imprecision in nearly all tax code systems that determine a person's profession, since many creative people operate simultaneously in multiple roles and jobs.  Both these factors mean that official statistics relating to the Creative Industries should be treated with caution.

The creative industries in Europe make a significant contribution to the EU economy, creating about 3% of EU GDP – corresponding to an annual market value of €500 billion – and employing about 6 million people. In addition, the sector plays a crucial role in fostering innovation, in particular for devices and networks. The EU records the second highest TV viewing figures globally, producing more films than any other region in the world. In that respect, the newly proposed [[Creative Europe|'Creative Europe' programme]] (July 2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/creative-europe/opportunities/index_en.htm|title=Creative Europe - European Commission|author=|date=|website=Creative Europe|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430180132/http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/creative-europe/opportunities/index_en.htm|archivedate=30 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; will help preserve cultural heritage while increasing the circulation of creative works inside and outside the EU. The programme will play a consequential role in stimulating cross border co-operation, promoting peer learning and making these sectors more professional. The Commission will then propose a financial instrument run by the European Investment Bank to provide debt and equity finance for cultural and creative industries. The role of the non-state actors within the governance regarding Medias will not be neglected anymore. Therefore, building a new approach extolling the crucial importance of a European level playing field industry may boost the adoption of policies aimed at developing a conducive environment, enabling European companies as well as citizens to use their imagination and creativity – both sources of innovation -, and therefore of competitiveness and sustainability. It supposes to tailor the regulatory and institutional frameworks in supporting private-public collaboration, in particular in the Medias sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119013813/http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= }} with Violaine Hacker&lt;/ref&gt; The EU therefore plans to develop clusters, financing instruments as well as foresight activities to support this sector. The European Commission wishes to assist European creators and audiovisual enterprises to develop new markets through the use of digital technology, and asks how policy-making can best help achieve this. A more entrepreneurial culture will have to take hold with a more positive attitude towards risk-taking, and a capacity to innovate anticipating future trends. Creativity plays an important role in human resource management as artists and creative professionals can [[Lateral thinking|think laterally]]. Moreover, new jobs requiring new skills created in the post-crisis economy should be supported by labour mobility to ensure that people are employed wherever their skills are needed.

===In the US===
In the introduction to a 2013 special issue of ''Work and Occupations'' on artists in the US workforce, the guest editors argue that by examining the work lives of artists, one can identify characteristics and actions that help both individual workers and policy makers adapt to changing economic conditions.  Elizabeth Lingo and Steven Tepper cite multiple sources to suggest artists' skill sets allow them to "work beyond existing markets and create entirely new opportunities for themselves and others".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Lingo, Elizabeth L. and Tepper, Steven J (2013), [http://wox.sagepub.com/content/40/4/337.full.pdf+html 'Looking Back, Looking Forward: Arts-Based Careers and Creative Work'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506232653/http://wox.sagepub.com/content/40/4/337.full.pdf+html |date=2015-05-06 }}, in Work and Occupations 40(4) 337-363.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Lingo and Tepper suggest artistic workers are "catalysts of change and innovation" because they "face special challenges managing ambiguity, developing and sustaining a relative identity, and forming community in the context of an individually based enterprise economy" (2013). Because of these adaptive skills, the suggestion is that "studying how artists cope with uncertainty and the factors that influence their success should be relevant for understanding these broader social and economic trends facing today's (and tomorrow's) workforce."&lt;ref&gt;Lingo, Elizabeth L. and Tepper, Steven J (2013), [http://wox.sagepub.com/content/40/4/337.full.pdf+html 'Looking Back, Looking Forward: Arts-Based Careers and Creative Work'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506232653/http://wox.sagepub.com/content/40/4/337.full.pdf+html |date=2015-05-06 }} in Work and Occupations 40(4) 337-363.&lt;/ref&gt;

This view of artist-as-change-agent changes the questions researchers ask of creative economies. Old research questions would focus on topics like "skills, work practices, contracts, wage differentials, employment incentives, formal credentials, employment pipelines, and labor flows of differentiated occupational categories". Examples of new questions include:
# How do artists both create changes in the labor market itself and the way cultural work is done?
# What is their process of innovation and enterprise?

==Wider role==
As some first world countries struggle to compete in traditional markets such as [[manufacturing]], many now see the creative industry as a key component in a new [[knowledge economy]], capable perhaps of delivering [[urban regeneration]], often through initiatives linked to exploitation of [[cultural heritage]] that leads to increased [[tourism]]. It is often argued that, in future, the ideas and imagination of countries like the [[United Kingdom]] will be their greatest asset; in support of this argument, a number of universities in the UK have started to offer [[creative entrepreneurship]] as a specific area for study and research. Indeed, UK government figures reveal that the UK's creative industries account for over a million jobs and brought in £112.5 billion to the UK economy (DCMS ''Creative Industries Mapping Document'' 2001), although the data sets underlying these figures are open to question.

In recent years, creative industries have become 'increasingly attractive to governments outside the developed world'.&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, Stuart, Ryan, Mark David, Keane, Michael &amp; Ordonez, Diego (2008), ‘Financing Creative Industries in Developing Countries’, in Diana Barrowclough and Zeljka Kozul-Wright eds, [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/17984/1/17984.pdf "Creative Industries and Developing Countries: Voice, Choice and Economic Growth"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050038/http://eprints.qut.edu.au/17984/1/17984.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}, Routledge, London and New York, pp. 65-110.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) XI High Level Panel on Creative Industries and Development commissioned several studies to identify challenges and opportunities facing the growth and development of creative industries in developing industries. As Cunningham ''et al.'' (2009) put it, 'the harnessing of creativity brings with it the potential of new wealth creation, the cultivation of local talent and the generation of creative capital, the development of new export markets, significant multiplier effects throughout the broader economy, the utilisation of information communication technologies and enhanced competitiveness in an increasingly global economy'. A key driver of interest in creative industries and development is the acknowledgement that the value of creative production resides in ideas and individual creativity, and developing countries have rich cultural traditions and pools of creative talent which lay a basic foundation for creative enterprises. Reflecting the growing interest in the potential of creative industries in developing countries, in October 2011 a Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy was created within the Indonesian government with well-known economist [[Mari Pangestu|Dr Mari Pangestu]] appointed as the first minister to hold the position.

'''Dan Park''' (born May 4, 1968)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Birth data from Ratsit.se | url = http://www.ratsit.se/19680504-Dan_Fredrik_Park_Limhamn/ph-02o_-HdApJMgEYq_agD6UsZabOtLv6Y4ZEYM2q8M}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Swedish [[street artist]] who has been arrested, fined, and sentenced to jail for [[Hate speech#Sweden|hate speech]] in Swedish Courts several times for his art.

In 2011, Park was arrested for a collage poster depicting an Afro-Swede &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Swedish artist jailed for 'race hate'  | url = http://www.thelocal.se/20140821/swedish-artist-jailed-for-race-hate-pictures | work=[[The Local]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; student activist naked and in chains along with text saying "Our negro slave has run away", and the activist's personal contact information. Park singled out the student activist for reporting a student party with people in blackface. Park was convicted of defamation and racial agitation, and given a suspended sentence, fined, and ordered to pay damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Artist avoids jail for 'negro slave taunt' | url = http://www.thelocal.se/20120127/38756 | work=[[The Local]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Park was arrested at the opening of an exhibition of his collage posters, and was sentenced to 6 months in jail for incitement to racial agitation and defamation, and ordered to pay a total of 60,000 kronor ($8,700) in damages to four people depicted in his pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thelocal.se/20140821/swedish-artist-jailed-for-race-hate-pictures |title=Swedish artist jailed for 'race hate' pictures |work=[[The Local]] |date=2014-08-21 |accessdate=2014-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the court ordered 9 of his works destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Sentenced: Swedish Artist Dan Park "Incited Against an Ethnic Group" | url = http://hyperallergic.com/154676/sentenced-swedish-artist-dan-park-incited-against-an-ethnic-group/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Park himself insists that his works are not racist, but a satiric commentary on current events and against [[political correctness]] in Sweden. Park is mainly notable for the intense public debate about [[freedom of speech]] that his case and works have generated, especially in Denmark, where his works have been exhibited in the Parliament building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Dan Parks forbudte billeder vises på Christiansborg i dag | publisher=Politiken | url=http://politiken.dk/kultur/kunst/ECE2432649/dan-parks-forbudte-billeder-vises-paa-christiansborg-i-dag/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Defamiliarization''' or '''''ostranenie''''' ({{lang-rus|остранение|p=ɐstrɐˈnʲenʲɪjə}}) is the [[art]]istic technique of presenting to audiences common things in an unfamiliar or strange way &lt;!--typically (is it also used for other rasons / without an explicit intention?)--&gt;in order to enhance perception of the familiar.

== History ==

&lt;blockquote&gt;
According to (De Guzman, 2016), Defamiliarization of that which is or has become familiar or taken for granted, hence automatically perceived, is the basic function of all devices. And with defamiliarization come both the slowing down and the increased difficulty (impeding) of the process of reading and comprehending and an awareness of the artistic procedures (devices) causing them.  (Margolin 2005)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term "defamiliarization" was first coined in 1917 by [[Viktor Shklovsky]] in his essay "Art as Device" (alternate translation: "Art as Technique") (Crawford 209).  Shklovsky invented the term as a means to "distinguish poetic from practical language on the basis of the former's perceptibility" (Crawford 209).  Essentially, he is stating that [[poetic language]] is fundamentally different than the language that we use every day because it is more difficult to understand:  "Poetic speech is ''formed speech''.  [[Prose]] is ordinary speech – economical, easy, proper, the goddess of prose [''dea prosae''] is a goddess of the accurate, facile type, of the "direct" expression of a child" (Shklovsky 20).  This difference is the key to the creation of art and the prevention of "over-automatization," which causes an individual to "function as though by formula" (Shklovsky 16).  This distinction between artistic language and everyday language, for Shklovsky, applies to all artistic forms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The purpose of art is to impart the sensation of things as they are perceived and not as they are known.  The technique of art is to make objects ‘unfamiliar,' to make forms difficult to increase the difficulty and length of perception because the process of perception is an aesthetic end in itself and must be prolonged. (Shklovsky 16) 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Thus, defamiliarization serves as a means to force individuals to recognize artistic language:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In studying poetic speech in its phonetic and [[Word|lexical]] structure as well as in its characteristic distribution of words and in the characteristic thought structures compounded from the words, we find everywhere the artistic trademark – that is, we find material obviously created to remove the automatism of perception; the author's purpose is to create the vision which results from that deautomatized perception.  A work is created "artistically" so that its perception is impeded and the greatest possible effect is produced through the slowness of the perception.  (Shklovsky 19)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This technique is meant to be especially useful in distinguishing poetry from prose, for, as [[Aristotle]] said, "poetic language must appear strange and wonderful" (Shklovsky 19).

=== In Russian literature ===

To illustrate what he means by defamiliarization, Shklovsky uses examples from [[Tolstoy]], whom he cites as using the technique throughout his works: "The narrator of '[[Kholstomer]],' for example, is a horse, and it is the horse's point of view (rather than a person's) that makes the content of the story seem unfamiliar" (Shklovsky 16).  As a Russian Formalist, many of Shklovsky's examples use Russian authors and Russian dialects: "And currently [[Maxim Gorky]] is changing his diction from the old literary language to the new literary colloquialism of [[Nikolai Leskov|Leskov]].  Ordinary speech and literary language have thereby changed places (see the work of [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (poet)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] and many others)" (Shklovsky 19-20).

Defamiliarization also includes the use of foreign languages within a work.  At the time that Shklovsky was writing, there was a change in the use of language in both [[literature]] and everyday spoken Russian.  As Shklovsky puts it: "Russian literary language, which was originally foreign to [[Russia]], has so permeated the language of the people that it has blended with their conversation.  On the other hand, literature has now begun to show a tendency towards the use of dialects and/or barbarisms" (Shklovsky 19).

=== Différance ===

Shklovsky's defamiliarization can also be compared to [[Jacques Derrida]]'s concept of [[différance]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
What Shklovskij wants to show is that the operation of defamiliarization and its consequent perception in the literary system is like the winding of a watch (the introduction of energy into a physical system): both "originate" difference, change, value, motion, presence.  Considered against the general and functional background of Derridian différance, what Shklovskij calls "perception" can be considered a matrix for production of difference.  (Crawford 212) 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Since the term différance refers to the dual meanings of the [[French language|French]] word difference to mean both "to differ" and "to defer", defamiliarization draws attention to the use of common language in such a way as to alter one's perception of an easily understandable object or concept.  The use of defamiliarization both differs and defers, since the use of the technique alters one's perception of a concept (to defer), and forces one to think about the concept in different, often more complex, terms (to differ).

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Shklovskij's formulations negate or cancel out the existence/possibility of a "real" perception: variously, by (1) the familiar Formalist denial of a link between literature and life, connoting their status as non-communicating vessels, (2) always, as if compulsively, referring to a real experience in terms of empty, dead, and automatized repetition and recognition, and (3) implicitly locating real perception at an unspecifiable temporally anterior and spatially other place, at a mythic "first time" of naïve experience, the loss of which to automatization is  to be restored by aesthetic perceptual fullness. (Crawford 218)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== The Uncanny ===

The influence of Russian Formalism on twentieth-century art and culture is largely due to the literary technique of defamiliarization or ‘making strange’, and has also been linked to Freud’s notion of the uncanny.&lt;ref&gt;Royle, Nicholas.  ''The Uncanny''.  New York: Routledge, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Das Unheimliche'' ("The Uncanny"),&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund.  ''The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud''. Volume XVII.  Ed. James Strachey.  London: Hogarth Press, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud states that “the uncanny is that class of the frightening which leads back to what is known of old and long familiar,” however, this is not a fear of the unknown, but more of a feeling about something being both strange and familiar (220).  The connection between ''ostranenie'' and the uncanny can be seen where Freud muses on the technique of literary uncanniness: “It is true that the writer creates a kind of uncertainty in us in the beginning by not letting us know, no doubt purposely, whether he is taking us into the real world or into a purely fantastic one of his own creation” (230).  When “the writer pretends to move in the world of common reality,” they can situate supernatural events, such as the animation of inanimate objects, in the quotidian, day-to-day reality of the modern world, defamiliarizing the reader and provoking an uncanny feeling (250).

== Usage ==
The technique appears in English Romantic poetry, particularly in the poetry of [[Wordsworth]], and was defined in the following way by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], in his ''[[Biographia Literaria]]'': "To carry on the feelings of childhood into the powers of manhood; to combine the child's sense of wonder and novelty with the appearances which every day for perhaps forty years had rendered familiar ... this is the character and privilege of genius." 
 
In more recent times, it has been associated with the poet and playwright [[Bertolt Brecht]], whose [[Verfremdungseffekt]] ("estrangement effect") was a potent element of his approach to theater. In fact, as Willett points out, Verfremdungseffekt is "a translation of the Russian critic Viktor Shklovskij's phrase 'Priem Ostranenija', or 'device for making strange'".&lt;ref&gt;(Willett, John.  ''Brecht on Theatre: The Development of an Aesthetic''.  New York: Hill and Wang, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; Brecht, in turn, has been highly influential for artists and filmmakers including Jean-Luc Godard and Yvonne Rainer.

The word '''diorama''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|aɪ|ə|ˈ|r|ɑː|m|ə}} can either refer to a 19th-century mobile theatre device, or, in modern usage, a three-dimensional full-size or miniature model, sometimes enclosed in a glass showcase for a museum. Dioramas are often built by hobbyists as part of related hobbies such as [[Model military vehicle|military vehicle modeling]], [[Model figure|miniature figure modeling]], or [[Model airplane|aircraft modeling]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

== Etymology ==
The word "diorama" originated in 1823 as a type of picture-viewing device, from the French in 1822. The word literally means "through that which is seen", from the [[greek language|Greek]] di- "through" + orama "that which is seen, a sight". The diorama was invented by [[Louis Daguerre]] and [[Charles Marie Bouton]], first exhibited in [[Paris]] in July 1822 and in [[London]] on September 29, 1823.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Daguerre#Diorama theatres|Diorama Theatres - Wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{fact|date=January 2017}} The meaning "small-scale replica of a scene, etc." is from 1902.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/etymology/diorama Diorama - Word Origin &amp; History] - Online Etymology Dictionary - ''Dictionary.com''. Retrieved 1 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Daguerre's and Bouton's diorama consisted of a piece of material painted on both sides. When illuminated from the front, the scene would be shown in one state and by switching to illumination from behind another phase or aspect would be seen. Scenes in daylight changed to moonlight, a train travelling on a track would crash, or an earthquake would be shown in before and after pictures.

== The modern diorama ==
[[File:Cooling tower construction diorama.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cooling tower]] construction diorama]]
The current, popular understanding of the term "diorama" denotes a partially three-dimensional, full-size replica or [[scale model]] of a landscape typically showing historical events, nature scenes or cityscapes, for purposes of education or entertainment.

One of the first uses of dioramas in a museum was in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], where the [[Biological museum (Stockholm)|Biological Museum]] opened in 1893. It had several dioramas, over three floors. They were also implemented by the National Museum Grigore Antipa from Bucharest Romania and constituted a source of inspiration for many important museums in the world (such as the Museum of Natural History of New York and the Great Oceanographic Museum in Berlin) [reference below]. 

===Miniatures===
Miniature dioramas are typically much smaller, and use scale models and landscaping to create historical or fictional scenes. Such a scale model-based diorama is used, for example, in [[Chicago]]'s [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] to display [[Rail transport|railroading]]. This diorama employs a common [[Rail transport modelling|model railroading]] scale of 1:87 ([[HO scale]]). Hobbyist dioramas often use scales such as 1:35 or 1:48.

An early, and exceptionally large example was created between 1830 and 1838 by a British Army officer.

Modern museum dioramas may be seen in most major natural history museums. Typically, these displays use a tilted plane to represent what would otherwise be a level surface, incorporate a painted background of distant objects, and often employ false perspective, carefully modifying the scale of objects placed on the plane to reinforce the [[illusion]] through [[depth perception]] in which objects of identical real-world size placed farther from the observer appear smaller than those closer. Often the distant painted background or sky will be painted upon a continuous curved surface so that the viewer is not distracted by corners, seams, or edges. All of these techniques are means of presenting a realistic view of a large scene in a compact space. A photograph or single-eye view of such a diorama can be especially convincing since in this case there is no distraction by the [[binocular disparity|binocular perception]] of depth.

Miniature dioramas may be used to represent scenes from historic events. A typical example of this type are the dioramas to be seen at [[Norway's Resistance Museum]] in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]].

Landscapes built around model railways can also be considered dioramas, even though they often have to compromise scale accuracy for better operating characteristics.

Hobbyists also build dioramas of historical or quasi-historical events using a variety of materials, including [[plastic model]]s of military vehicles, ships or other equipment, along with scale figures and landscaping.

In the 19th and beginning 20th century, building dioramas of sailing ships had been a popular handcraft of mariners. Building a diorama instead of a normal model had the advantage that in the diorama, the model was protected inside the framework and could easily be stowed below the bunk or behind the sea chest. Nowadays, such antique sailing ship dioramas are valuable collectors' items.

One of the largest dioramas ever created{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} was a model of the entire State of [[California]] built for the [[Panama-Pacific International Exposition]] of 1915 and that for a long time was installed in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]'s [[San Francisco Ferry Building|Ferry Building]].

Dioramas are widely used in the [[American educational system]], mostly in elementary and middle schools. They are often made to represent historical events, ecological [[biomes]], cultural scenes, or to visually depict literature. They are usually made from a shoebox and contain a [[trompe-l'œil]] in the background contrasted with two or three-dimensional models in the foreground.

==Historic dioramas==
===The Daguerre and Bouton Dioramas===
[[File:Diorama diagram.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Ground-plan of the Diorama Building, London 1823, by A. Pugin and J. Morgan (illustration reproduced from Gernsheim 1968, p 21)]]
The Diorama was a popular entertainment that originated in Paris in 1822. An alternative to the also popular "[[Panorama]]" ([[panoramic painting]]), the Diorama was a theatrical experience viewed by an audience in a highly specialized theatre. As many as 350 patrons would file in to view a landscape painting that would change its appearance both subtly and dramatically. Most would stand, though limited seating was provided. The show lasted 10 to 15 minutes, after which time the entire audience (on a massive turntable) would rotate to view a second painting. Later models of the Diorama theater even held a third painting.

The size of the [[proscenium]] was {{convert|24|ft|m}} wide by {{convert|21|ft|m}} high (7.3 meters x 6.4 meters). Each scene was hand-painted on linen, which was made transparent in selected areas. A series of these multi-layered, linen panels were arranged in a deep, truncated tunnel, then illuminated by sunlight re-directed via skylights, screens, shutters, and colored blinds. Depending on the direction and intensity of the skillfully manipulated light, the scene would appear to change. The effect was so subtle and finely rendered that both critics and the public were astounded, believing they were looking at a natural scene.

The inventors and proprietors of the Diorama were [[Charles Marie Bouton|Charles-Marie Bouton]] (1781– 1853), a Troubador painter who also worked at the Panorama under Pierre Prévost, and [[Louis Jacques Mandé Daguerre]] (1787–1851), formerly a decorator, manufacturer of mirrors, painter of Panoramas, and designer and painter of theatrical stage illusions. Daguerre would later co-invent the [[daguerreotype]], the first widely used method of [[photography]].

A second Diorama building in [[Regent's Park]] in London was opened by an association of Englishmen (having a contract to purchase Daguerre's tableaux) in 1823, a year after the debut of Daguerre's Paris original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midley.co.uk/diorama/Diorama_Wood_1_1.htm|title=The Diorama in Great Britain by R.

The show was a popular sensation, and spawned immediate imitations. British artists like [[Clarkson Stanfield]] and [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]] produced ever-more elaborate (moving) dioramas through the 1830s; sound effects and even living performers were added. Some "typical diorama effects included moonlit nights, winter snow turning into a summer meadow, rainbows after a storm, illuminated fountains," waterfalls, thunder and lightning, and ringing bells.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Lambourne, ''Victorian Painting'', London, Phaidon Press, 1999; p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; A diorama painted by Daguerre is currently housed in the church of the French town [[Bry-sur-Marne]], where he lived and died.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.bry94.fr/sites/bry/fichier/diaporama_diorama.pdf All about Daguerre's diorama in Bry]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.bry94.fr/bry/2308.htm About the diorama on Bry's official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Gottstein Dioramas ===
Until 1968, Britain boasted a large collection of dioramas. These collections were originally housed in the [[Royal United Services Institute]] Museum, (formerly the [[Banqueting House]]), in [[Whitehall]]. However, when the museum closed, the various exhibits and their 15 known dioramas were distributed to smaller museums throughout [[England]], some ending up in [[Canada]] and elsewhere. These dioramas were the brainchild of the wealthy furrier Otto Gottstein (1892–1951) of [[Leipzig]], a Jewish immigrant from [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's Germany]], who was an avid collector and designer of flat model figures called flats. In 1930, Gottstein's influence is first seen at the Leipzig International Exhibition, along with the dioramas of Hahnemann of [[Kiel]], Biebel of [[Berlin]] and Muller of [[Erfurt]], all displaying their own figures, and those commissioned from such as Ludwig Frank in large diorama form. In 1933, Gottstein left Germany, and in 1935 founded the British Model Soldier Society. Gottstein persuaded designer and painter friends in both [[Germany]] and [[France]] to help in the construction of dioramas depicting notable events in English history. But due to the war, many of the figures arrived in England incomplete. The task of turning Gottstein's ideas into reality fell to his English friends and those friends who had managed to escape from the Continent. Dennis (Denny) C. Stokes, a talented painter and diorama maker in his own right, was responsible for the painting of the backgrounds of all the dioramas, creating a unity seen throughout the whole series. Denny Stokes was given the overall supervision of the fifteen dioramas.

# The Landing of the Romans under [[Julius Caesar]] in 55 B.C.
# The [[Battle of Hastings]].
# The Storming of [[Siege of Acre (1189–91) | Acre]]. (Figures by Muller.)
# The [[Battle of Crecy]]. (Figures by Muller.)
# The [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]].
# The [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] reviewing her troops at [[Tilbury]].
# The [[Battle of Marston Moor]].
# The [[Battle of Blenheim]]. (Painted by Douchkine.)
# The [[Battle of Plessey]].
# The [[Battle of Quebec (1759)|Battle of Quebec]]. (Engraved by Krunert of Vienna.)
# The [[Old Guard (France)|Old Guard]] at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]].
# The [[Charge of the Light Brigade]].
# The [[Battle of Ulundi]]. (figures by Ochel, and Petrocochino - ''pseudonym of Paul Armont''.)
# The Battle of Fleurs.
# The [[D-Day landings]].

Krunert, Schirmer, Frank, Frauendorf, Maier, Franz Rieche, and Oesterrich were also involved in the manufacture and design of figures for the various dioramas. Krunert (a Viennese), like Gottstein an exile in London, was given the job of engraving for ''‘The Battle of Quebec’''. Unfortunately, the ''‘death of Wolfe’'' was found to be inaccurate and had to be re-designed. The names of the vast majority of painters employed by Gottstein are mostly unknown, most lived and worked on the continent, among them Gustave Kenmow, Leopold Rieche, L. Dunekate, M. Alexandre, A. Ochel, Honey Ray, and, perhaps Gottstein's top painter, Vladimir Douchkine (a Russian émigré who lived in Paris). Douchkine was responsible for painting two figures of the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] on horseback for ''‘The Blenheim Diorama’'', one of which was used, the other, Gottstein being the true collector, was never released.

Denny Stokes painted all the backgrounds of all the dioramas, Herbert Norris, the Historical Costume Designer, whom Dr. J. F. Lovel-Barnes introduced to Gottstein, was responsible for the costume design of the [[Ancient Britons]], the [[Normans]] and [[Saxons]], some of the figures of ''‘The Field of the Cloth of Gold’'' and the [[Elizabethan]] figures for ''‘Queen Elizabeth at Tilbury’''. Dr. J.F. Lovel-Barnes was himself responsible for the ''‘Battle of Blenheim’'' diorama, selecting the figures, and arrangement of the scene. Due to World War II, when flat figures became unavailable, Gottstein completed his ideas by using Greenwood and Ball's 20&amp;nbsp;mm figures. In time, a fifteenth diorama was added, using these 20&amp;nbsp;mm figures, this diorama representing the ''‘D-Day landings’''. When all the dioramas were completed, they were displayed along one wall in the [[Royal United Services Institute]] Museum. When the museum was closed the fifteen dioramas were distributed to various museums and institutions. The greatest number are to be found at the [[Glenbow Museum]], (130-9th Avenue, S. E. Calgary, Alberta, Canada): RE: '''The Landing of the Romans under Julius Caesar in 55 BC', 'The Battle Of Crecy', 'The Battle of Blenheim', 'The Old Guard at Waterloo', 'The Charge of the Light Brigade at Balaclava'.''
 
The state of these dioramas is one of debate; John Garratt (''The World of Model Soldiers'') claimed in 1968, that the dioramas "appear to have been partially broken up and individual figures have been sold to collectors". According to the Glenbow Institute (Barry Agnew, Curator) "the figures are still in reasonable condition, but the plaster groundwork has suffered considerable deterioration". Unfortunately, there are no photographs available of the dioramas. ''‘The Battle of Hastings’'' diorama was to be found in the Old Town Museum, [[Hastings]], and is still in reasonable condition. It shows the Norman cavalry charging up [[Senlac Hill]] towards the Saxon lines. 
'‘The Storming of Acre’'' is in the Museum of Artillery at the Rotunda, [[Woolwich]]. John Garratt, in the "Encyclopedia of Model Soldiers", states that ''‘The Field of the Cloth of Gold’'' was in the possession of the [[Royal Military School of Music]], [[Kneller Hall]]; however, according to the Curator, the diorama had not been in his possession since 1980, nor is it listed in their Accession Book, so the whereabouts of this diorama is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the British Flat Figure Society'': Issue One – April 1986.

===The Frank Wong dioramas===

[[San Francisco, California]] artist '''Frank Wong''' (born 22 September 1932) created [[Dioramas|miniature dioramas]] that depict the [[Chinatown, San Francisco|San Francisco Chinatown]] of his youth during the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref name = sfchron&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guthrie|first1=Julian|title=Frank Wong recalls life in Chinatown through miniature dioramas|url=http://www.sfgate.com/art/article/Frank-Wong-recalls-life-in-Chinatown-through-5706947.php|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other dioramas ===
[[File:Battle of Midway.jpg|thumb|This photorealistic diorama of the [[Battle of Midway]] was created during World War II on the basis of information then available.]]
Painters of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] era like [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]] and [[Francis Danby]] were influenced to create large and highly dramatic pictures by the sensational dioramas and panoramas of their day. In one case, the connection between life and diorama art became intensely circular. On 1 February 1829, John Martin's brother Jonathan, known as "Mad Martin," set fire to the roof of [[York Minster]]. Clarkson Stanfield created a diorama re-enactment of the event, which premiered on 20 April of the same year; it employed a "safe fire" via chemical reaction as a special effect. On 27 May, the "safe" fire proved to be less safe than planned: it set a real fire in the painted cloths of the imitation fire, which burned down the theater and all of its dioramas.&lt;ref&gt;Lambourne, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, dioramas remained popular in England, Scotland, and Ireland through most of the 19th century, lasting until 1880.

A small scale version of the diorama called the [[Polyrama Panoptique]] could display images in the home and was marketed from the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/results.asp?image=10302430&amp;wwwflag=2&amp;imagepos=1 Science &amp; Society Picture Library: the collections of the Science Museum, the National Railway Museum and the National Museum of Photography, Film &amp; Television]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural history dioramas==
Natural history dioramas seek to imitate nature and, since their conception in the late 19th century, aim to "nurture a reverence for nature [with its] beauty and grandeur".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006; p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; They have also been described as a means to visually preserve nature as different environments change due to human involvement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-v1.amnh.org/exhibitions/dioramas/ Diorama Exhibition at the American Natural History Museum] – Retrieved 4 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; They were extremely popular during the first half of the 20th century, both in the USA and UK, later on giving way to television, film, and new perspectives on science.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006; p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carla Yanni, Nature’s Museums: Victorian Science and the Architecture of Display, Princeton Architectural Press, New York, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like historical dioramas, natural history dioramas are a mix of two- and three-dimensional elements. What sets natural history dioramas apart from other categories is the use of taxidermy in addition to the foreground replicas and painted background. The use of taxidermy means that natural history dioramas derive not only from Daguerre's work, but also from that of taxidermists, who were used to preparing specimens for either science or spectacle. It was only with the dioramas' precursors (and, later on, dioramas) that both these objectives merged. Popular diorama precursors were produced by [[Charles Willson Peale]], an artist with an interest in taxidermy, during the early 19th century. To present his specimens, Peale "painted skies and landscapes on the back of cases displaying his taxidermy specimens".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006; p. 13-4&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 19th century, the [[British Museum]] held an exhibition featuring taxidermy birds set on models of plants.

The first habitat diorama created for a museum was constructed by taxidermist [[Carl Akeley]] for the [[Milwaukee Public Museum]] in 1889,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006; p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; where it is still held. Akeley set taxidermy muskrats in a three-dimensional re-creation of their wetland habitat with a realistic painted background. With the support of curator [[Frank M. Chapman]], Akeley designed the popular habitat dioramas featured at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. Combining art with science, these exhibitions were intended to educate the public about the growing need for [[habitat conservation]]. The modern [[AMNH Exhibitions Lab]] is charged with the creation of all dioramas and otherwise immersive environments in the museum.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York,. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A predecessor of Akeley, naturalist and taxidermist [[Martha Maxwell]], created a famous habitat diorama for the [[Centennial Exposition|first World's Fair]] in 1876. The complex diorama featured taxidermied animals in realistic action poses, running water, and live prairie dogs.&lt;ref name="Taxidermy Art"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Marbury|title=Taxidermy Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CoJLBAAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Artisan|isbn=978-1-57965-558-7|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is speculated this display was the first of its kind [outside of a museum].&lt;ref name="Taxidermy Art"/&gt; Maxwell's pioneering diorama work is said to have influenced major figures in taxidermy history who entered the field later, such as   Akeley and [[William Temple Hornaday]].&lt;ref name="Taxidermy Art"/&gt; 

Soon, the concern for accuracy came. Groups of scientists, taxidermists, and artists would go on expeditions to ensure accurate backgrounds and collect specimens,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; though some would be donated by game hunters.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Hanson, Animal Attractions: Nature on Display in American Zoos, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Natural history dioramas reached the peak of their grandeur with the opening of the [[American Museum of Natural History#African Mammal Hall|Akeley Hall of African Mammals]] in 1936,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; which featured large animals, such as elephants, surrounded by even larger scenery.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, various institutions lay different claims to notable dioramas. The Milwaukee Public Museum still displays the world's first diorama, created by Akeley; the [[American Museum of Natural History]], in New York, has what might be the world's largest diorama: a life-size replica of a blue whale; the [[Powell-Cotton Museum]], in Kent, UK, is known for having the world's oldest, unchanged, room-sized diorama, built in 1896.

===Constructing a diorama===

Natural history dioramas consist of 3 parts:

#The painted background
#The foreground
#Taxidermy specimens

Preparations for the background begin on the field, where an artist takes photographs and sketches references pieces. Once back at the museum, the artist has to depict the scenery with as much realism as possible. The challenge lies in the fact that the wall used is curved: this allows the background to surround the display without seams joining different panels. At times the wall also curves upward to meet the light above and form a sky. By having a curved wall, whatever the artist paints will be distorted by perspective; it is the artist's job to paint in such a way that minimises this distortion.

The foreground is created to mimic the ground, plants and other accessories to scenery. The ground, hills, rocks, and large trees are created with wood, wire mesh, and plaster. Smaller trees are either used in their entirety or replicated using casts. Grasses and shrubs can be preserved in solution or dried to then be added to the diorama. Ground debris, such as leaf litter, is collected on site and soaked in wallpaper paste for preservation and presentation in the diorama. Water is simulated using glass or plexiglass with ripples carved on the surface. For a diorama to be successful, the foreground and background must merge, so both artists have to work together.

Taxidermy specimens are usually the centrepiece of dioramas. Since they must entertain, as well as educate, specimens are set in lifelike poses, so as to convey a narrative of an animal's life. Smaller animals are usually made with rubber moulds and painted. Larger animals are prepared by first making a clay sculpture of the animal. This sculpture is made over the actual, posed skeleton of the animal, with reference to moulds and measurements taken on the field. A papier-mâché mannequin is prepared from the clay sculpture and the animal's tanned skin is sewn onto the mannequin. Glass eyes substitute the real ones.

If an animal is large enough, the scaffolding that holds the specimen needs to be incorporated into the foreground design and construction.

'''''Eight Men Speak''''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[play (theatre)|play]] written in 1933 by a committee of Oscar Ryan, E. Cecil-Smith, Frank Love and Mildred Goldberg.  Although the play made only one performance in its initial run, the attempts by the authorities to suppress it backfired into a political embarrassment for the Canadian government and Prime Minister [[R. B. Bennett]]. 

The [[agit-prop]] play told the story of [[Tim Buck]] and his arrest as a [[Communist Party of Canada|Communist]] under [[Section 98]] of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] that made simple association with an organization advocating violent overthrow of the government a crime.  However, such accusations were often made without regard to the organizations' actual intentions, effectively allowing the federal government to claim that any powerful group which potentially opposed them to be labelled as 'subversive'. Furthermore, it details the apparent assassination attempt on Buck during a [[prison riot]] when shots were fired into his cell despite the fact he was not participating in the riot in any way.

The play is most noted for the reaction of the local authorities following the play's one performance at [[Toronto]]'s [[Standard Theatre (Toronto)|Standard Theatre]] on December 4, 1933.  The police ordered the play closed and threatened to revoke the theatre's licence if the play was performed again. A theatre in [[Winnipeg]] had its licence revoked to pre-empt the play being performed there.

When the [[Progressive Arts Club]] had a meeting to protest this [[censorship]], a former minister, [[Albert Edward Smith|A. E. Smith]], described the play and its allegations of the attempted assassination of the Communist leader.  As a result, Smith was indicted for [[sedition]], but the resulting trial allowed Buck to take the stand and relate the events of the incident in open court.  Smith was acquitted, and Buck and his comrades were soon released afterward.

'''Expression''' (Lat. expressio) in [[architecture]] implies a clear and authentic displaying of the [[Character structure|character]] or personality of an individual ([[architect]]). The expression is often identified with the [[architectural]] movement of [[expressionism]], whose main starting point and aim is to present and express what has been „seen“ or [[experienced]] in the inner eye of the mind, heart and soul, i.e. to express the [[subjectivity|subjective]] moods and [[feelings]] without referring to conventional and „objective” values, judgments and truths. 

==Meaning==
The main problem in the [[critical analysis]] of the theoretical [[Aesthetic interpretation|interpretation]]s of the [[concept]] of expression in architecture, lies in the fact that the concept of expression is used in different ways in different fields of [[science]] and art. Regarding the [[concept]] of expression, the following interpretations can often be found:
*an activity or way of transforming an idea into words; 
*showing [[emotions]], [[feelings]] etc.;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, J. (2007). Expression and expressiveness in art. ''[[Postgraduate Journal of Aesthetics]]'', 4 (2), 19-41.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*conveying emotions by way of music, images etc.; 
*[[facial expression]] showing mood or emotion; 
*choice of words, [[phrases]], [[syntax]], [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] etc., in communication;&lt;ref&gt;Tošović, B. (2004). Ekspresivnost. Stil, 3, 25-61.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*a specific [[phrase]] commonly used to express something etc. 
In the widest sense, the [[concept]] of expression refers to the activity undertaken with a specific [[intention]]. However, what is the aim of expressing something will depend on the field in which the term is used.&lt;ref&gt;Alfirevic, Dj. (2011). Visual Expression in Architecture. Arhitektura i urbanizam, 31, 3-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

With this is mind, some authors emphasize the [[unconscious mind|unconscious]] or spontaneous character of expression,&lt;ref&gt;Collingwood, R. G. The Principles of Art. New York: Oxford University Press, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wenninger, R. (2005). Individual Style after the End of Art. Postgraduate Journal of Aesthetics, 2 (3), 105-115.&lt;/ref&gt; while others emphasize its [[cognitive]] aspect.&lt;ref&gt;Dilworth, J. (2004). Artistic Expression and Interpretation. [[British Journal of Aesthetics]], 44 (1), 10-28.&lt;/ref&gt;
Expression can also be defined as part of the [[communication]] process which consists of two complementary components, expression (transmitted information) and impression (received information).&lt;ref&gt;Argan Đ.K., Oliva Akile B. (1970). Modern Art 1770-1970-2000. Belgrade: CLIO, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also Robinson, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36818">'''Fan fiction''' or '''fanfiction''' (also abbreviated to '''fan fic''', '''fanfic''', '''fic''' or '''ff''') is [[fiction]] about characters or settings from an original work of fiction, created by [[Fan (person)|fans]] of that work rather than by its creator. Fans may maintain the creator's characters and settings or add their own. It is a popular form of [[fan labor]], particularly since the advent of the Internet.

Fan fiction is rarely commissioned or authorized by the original work's creator or publisher and is rarely professionally published. It may or may not [[Copyright infringement|infringe on the original author's copyright]], depending on the jurisdiction and on such questions as for whether or not it qualifies as "[[fair use]]" (see [[Legal issues with fan fiction]]). Attitudes of authors and copyright owners of original works to fan fiction have ranged from indifference to encouragement to rejection. Copyright owners have occasionally responded with legal action.

The term "fan fiction" came into use in the 20th century as [[copyright|copyright laws]] began to delineate between stories using established characters that were authorized by the copyright holder and those that were unauthorized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://reporter.rit.edu/views/fanfiction-legal-battle-creativity|title=Fanfiction: A Legal Battle of Creativity|date=2016-02-05|work=Reporter Magazine|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For earlier works with similar characteristics, see [[Sequel#Unofficial sequels|unofficial sequel]] or [[pastiche]].

Fan fiction is defined by being both related to its subject's [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] [[fictional universe]]  (often referred to as "canon") and simultaneously existing outside it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Fan-Fiction-TV-Viewers-Have-It-Their-Way-1518184 |title=Fan Fiction—TV Viewers Have It Their Way |author=Schulz, Nancy | date=2001-12-31| publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most fan fiction writers assume that their work is read primarily by other fans, and therefore presume that their readers have knowledge of the canon universe (created by a professional writer) in which their works are based.

==Earlier meanings of the term==
The term "fan fiction" has been attested in print as early as 1939; in this earliest known citation, it is used in a disparaging way to refer to amateurish science fiction (as opposed to "pro fiction").&lt;ref name="bravenewwords"&gt;{{cite book | title = Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction | editor = Jeff Prucher | year = 2007 | publisher = Oxford University Press, Inc. | location = New York | page = 57 | isbn = 978-0-19-530567-8 | url = https://books.google.pl/books?id=iYzi8m8FbEsC&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term also appears in the 1944 ''Fancyclopedia'', an encyclopedia of fandom [[jargon]]. It is defined there as "fiction about fans, or sometimes about pros, and occasionally bringing in some famous characters from [science fiction] stories". The book also mentions that the term is "[s]ometimes improperly used to mean fan science fiction, that is, ordinary fantasy published in a fan magazine".&lt;ref name="bravenewwords" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fancyclopedia1944"&gt;{{cite book | title = Fancyclopedia | author = "John Bristol" | year = 1944 | publisher = The Fantasy Foundation | url = http://fanac.org/Fannish_Reference_Works/Fancyclopedia/Fancyclopedia_I/f1.html#8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Spockanalia2.jpg|right|thumb|The ''Star Trek'' fanzine ''Spockanalia'' contained the first fan fiction in the modern sense of the term.]]
The modern phenomenon of fan fiction as an expression of fandom and fan interaction was popularized and defined via [[Star Trek fandom|''Star Trek'' fandom]] and their [[fanzine]]s published in the 1960s. The first ''[[Star Trek]]'' fanzine, ''Spockanalia'' (1967), contained some fan fiction; many others followed its example.&lt;ref name="verba2003"&gt;{{cite book | title=Boldly Writing: A Trekker Fan &amp; Zine History, 1967-1987 | author=Verba, Joan Marie | year=2003 | publisher=FTL Publications | location=Minnetonka MN | url=http://www.ftlpublications.com/bwebook.pdf | isbn=0-9653575-4-6 | access-date=2017-04-03 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910042451/http://www.ftlpublications.com/bwebook.pdf | archive-date=2016-09-10 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} These fanzines were produced via offset printing and [[mimeograph]]y, and mailed to other fans or sold at [[science fiction conventions]] for a small fee to help recoup costs. Unlike other aspects of fandom, women dominated fan fiction authoring; 83% of ''Star Trek'' fan fiction authors were female by 1970, and 90% by 1973.&lt;ref name = "Coppa in Hellekson and Busse"&gt;{{Cite book | first = Francesca  | last = Coppa  | editor-last = Hellekson  | editor-first = Karen  | editor2-last = Busse  | editor2-first = Kristina  | contribution = A Brief History of Media Fandom  | title = Fan Fiction and Fan Communities in the Age of the Internet  | year = 2006  | pages = 41–59  | place = Jefferson, North Carolina  | publisher = [[McFarland &amp; Company]]  | isbn = 978-0-7864-2640-9 | postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar states that fan fiction "fill[s] the need of a mostly female audience for fictional narratives that expand the boundary of the official source products offered on the television and movie screen."&lt;ref name="cbs2000"&gt;{{cite book | title=Science Fiction Culture | publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press | author=Bacon-Smith, Camille | pages=112–113 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oCvIZpCSRA0C&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage | year=2000 | isbn=978-0-8122-1530-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fan fiction has become more popular and widespread since the advent of the World Wide Web; according to one estimate, fan fiction comprises one third of all content about books on the Web.&lt;ref name="boog20080918"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/brokeback-33-percent_b7743?c=rss |title=Brokeback 33 Percent |work=Mediabistro |date=September 18, 2008 |accessdate=January 22, 2012 |author=Boog, Jason |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210011535/http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/brokeback-33-percent_b7743?c=rss |archive-date=2013-02-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to traditional fanzines and conventions, [[Usenet group]] [[electronic mailing lists]] were established for fan fiction as well as fan discussion. Online, searchable fan fiction archives were also established. The online archives were initially non-commercial hand-tended and fandom- or topic-specific. These archives were followed by non-commercial automated databases. In 1998, the not-for-profit site [[FanFiction.Net]] came online, which allowed anyone to upload content in any fandom.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{Cite news |last=Buechner |first=Maryanne Murray |title=Pop Fiction |date=March 4, 2002 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1001950,00.html |accessdate=May 29, 2010 |newspaper=[[Time Magazine]] |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to self-publish fan fiction at an easily accessible common archive that did not require insider knowledge to join, and the ability to review the stories directly on the site, became popular quite quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bradley, Karen|date=Winter 2005|title=Internet lives: Social context and moral domain in adolescent development|journal=New Directions for Youth Development|volume=2005|issue=108|pages=57–76|pmid=16570878|doi=10.1002/yd.142}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One popular example of modern fan fiction is [[E. L. James]]' ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]''. This series was originally written as fan fiction for the ''[[Twilight (novel series)|Twilight]]'' series of books and movies and played off the characters of Bella and Edward. In order to not infringe on copyright issues, James changed the character names to Anna and Christian for the purposes of her novels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/holy-crow-fifty-shades-grey-crazy-similar-its-twil-215185|title=Holy crow!

On May 22, 2013, the online retailer [[Amazon.com]] established a new publishing service, [[Kindle Worlds]]. This service would enable fan fiction stories of certain licensed media properties to be sold in the [[Kindle Store]] with terms including 35% of net sales for works of 10,000 words or more and 20% for short fiction ranging from 5000 to 10,000 words. However, this arrangement includes restrictions on content, copyright violations, poor document formatting and/or using misleading titles.&lt;ref name="Amazon"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pepitone|first=Julianne|title=Amazon's "Kindle Worlds" lets fan fiction writers sell their stories|url=http://money.cnn.com/2013/05/23/technology/amazon-fan-fiction/?iid=HP_LN&amp;hpt=us_bn5|accessdate=23 May 2013|newspaper=CNN Money|date=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese dōjinshi===
A similar trend in [[Japanese literature|Japan]] also began appearing around the 1960s and 1970s, where [[Self-published|independently published]] [[manga]] and novels, known as ''[[dōjinshi]]'', are frequently published by [[dōjin]] circles; many of these dōjinshi are based on existing [[manga]], [[anime]], and [[video game]] franchises. [[Mangaka|Manga authors]] like [[Shotaro Ishinomori]] and [[Fujiko Fujio]] formed dōjin groups such as Fujio's {{nihongo|New Manga Party|新漫画党|Shin Manga-tō}}. At this time, dōjin groups were used by artists to make a professional debut. This changed in the coming decades with dōjin groups forming as school clubs and the like. This culminated in 1975 with the [[Comiket]] in Tokyo.

===Genres===
In addition to the "regular" [[list of genres]], which for fanfiction are usually determined by the work they're based on, there are a few genres that are closely associated with fanfic. Often, they also overlap. The genres include:

====Angst====
A story with an angsty mood centered on a character/characters who are brooding, sad, or in anguish.

====AU or alternate universe====
{{Main|Alternative universe (fan fiction)}}
Characters set in a universe other than their own canonical one.

====Crossover====
Works featuring characters, items, or setpieces from multiple fandoms.

====Darkfic====
Stories which are considerably grimmer and/or more depressing than the original, often in deliberate contrast to the canonical work(s). Not all stories tagged as "[[Darkness#Literature|dark]]" count as darkfic.  This is sometimes done with fandoms which are meant to be light-hearted or for children.

====Fix-fic====
A counterpart to darkfic, or perhaps its supergenre, fix-fic or more commonly known as "fix-it", refers to stories which rewrite canonical events that the author disliked, often because they were depressing or incomprehensible.

====Fluff or WAFF====
A story designed to be happy, and nothing else. The plot is usually less relevant in these types of works, as the main focus is to be cheerful. WAFF is short for "Warm And Fuzzy Feelings," and the two terms are quite similar in usage.

====Fusion====
Works blending two settings, and sometimes their casts, into a cohesive whole.

====Hurt/comfort====
A story in which a character is put through a traumatizing experience in order to be comforted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Fanspeak Dictionary|url=http://expressions.populli.net/dictionary.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Peggy Sue====
A story in which one of the characters is sent back in time, getting a second chance with knowledge of the original plot. Named after the movie ''[[Peggy Sue Got Married]]'', in which this happens to the titular character. [[Groundhog Day (film)|''Groundhog Day'']] is an example of this happening repeatedly. Refers to both the story and the character in this situation. Not related to [[Mary Sue]].

====Rationalist rewrite====
Rebuild fiction that heavily features critical thinking skills and deductive reasoning. Also popularized by ''Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality''.

====Rebuild fiction====
A subtype of fix-fic, wherein aspects of the setting and/or characters are rewritten to be more cohesive. Named for the ''[[Rebuild of Evangelion]]'' series, which originally qualified, and popularized by ''[[Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]]''.

====Self-insert====
A genre of fanfiction in which a version of the author is transported to, or discovers they are inside, the world the fanfiction is based on. Almost always [[first-person narration|written in the first person]]. Fanfictions of this type are often also fix-fics.

====Multicross self-insert====
Instead of a single fictional universe, the inserted author is taken to many in a row, and must usually solve some problem or complete some challenge in each place before moving on. Gaining new powers and occasionally companions from each world is common.

====Shipping====
A variant of [[list of genres#romance|romance]], focused on exploring a relationship between two or more characters from the original fandom(s). It has several subgenres, including Slash (which focuses on homosexual pairings, usually of the male variety), [[Femslash]]/Femmeslash/Yuri (same as Slash, but exclusively female/female), Crossover Shipping, which focuses on a romance between characters from multiple fandoms, and "friendshipping", which focuses on platonic relationships.

====Curtainfic====
A subcategory of shipping; describes romantic couples in mundane domestic situations such as picking out [[curtains]].

====Smut====
Smut is sexually explicit or pornographic writing. This could refer to a small portion of a story, or in its entirety.  The terms "lemon" and "lime" are often used to allude to the upcoming sexual scene.

====Songfic====
Songfic, also known as a song fic or a song-fic, is a genre of fan fiction that features a fictional work interspersed with the lyrics of a relevant song.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yfOTAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA320&amp;dq=Songfic#v=onepage&amp;q=Songfic|title=Critical Perspectives on Harry Potter|last=Heilman|first=Elizabeth E.|date=2008-09-01|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135891541|pages=320–321}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WbcqDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=Songfic#v=onepage&amp;q=Songfic|title=Media Convergence Handbook - Vol. 2: Firms and User Perspectives|last=Lugmayr|first=Artur|last2=Zotto|first2=Cinzia Dal|date=2016-07-23|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783642544873|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is a [[portmanteau]] of "song" and "fiction"; as such, one might also see the genre referred to as "songfiction". As many lyrics are under [[copyright]], whether songfics are a violation of that copyright law is a subject of debate. Some fan fiction websites, such as FanFiction.Net, have barred authors from posting songfics with lyrics outside the [[public domain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fanfiction.net/guidelines/|title=Guidelines|website=FanFiction.net|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an essay in ''Music, Sound, and Silence in Buffy the Vampire Slayer'', [[University of Sydney]] professor [[Catherine Driscoll]] commented that the genre was "one of the least distinguished modes of fan production" and that "within fan fiction excessive attachment to or foregrounding of popular music is itself dismissed as immature and derivative".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TKxBuIcAoeEC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=Songfic#v=onepage&amp;q=Songfic|title=Music, Sound and Silence in Buffy the Vampire Slayer|last=Attinello|first=Paul Gregory|last2=Halfyard|first2=Janet K.|last3=Knights|first3=Vanessa|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=9780754660415|pages=114, 129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vent====
Vent refers to literature written by an author under duress or for therapeutic purposes, normally to calm themselves following a stressful or upsetting situation.

Author's notes can be written at any point during a fanfiction (in some cases interrupting the flow of the piece by appearing within the body of a fanfiction), but are typically found directly before the beginning of a fanfiction or after it has concluded, and also at the starts or ends of chapters if the story is updated periodically. A/N's are used to convey direct messages from the author to the reader regarding the piece.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Canon===
Canon is the original story. This means anything related to the original source including the plot, settings, and character developments.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/falcon/moonbeam/terms.html|title=Common Fandom Terms|last=|first=|date=May 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disclaimer ===
{{see also|Legal issues with fan fiction}}
[[Disclaimer]]s are author's notes typically informing readers about who deserves credit for the original source material,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://expressions.populli.net/dictionary.html|title=A Fanspeak Dictionary|last=Freeman|first=Morgan|date=|website=|access-date=April 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and often containing pseudo-legal language disavowing any intent of [[copyright infringement]] or alluding to [[fair use]]. Such "disclaimers" are legally ineffective and based on misunderstandings of [[copyright law]], particularly confusion between illegal copyright infringement and unethical [[plagiarism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dearauthor.com/features/letters-of-opinion/fan-fiction-plagiarism-and-copyright/|title=Fan Fiction, Plagiarism, and Copyright|date=18 March 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fandom ===
A [[fandom]] is a group of fans of a particular work of fiction (e.g. novel, film, television show or video game). Members of a fandom are typically interested in even minor details of the plot/characters of their fandom and often spend a significant portion of their time and energy involved with their interest, that is why most fanfictions are written by members of a particular fandom(s).

===Fangirl/fanboy===
A female/male that is a part of one or more fandoms. Furthermore, the term fangirling/fanboying refers to a moment where a person "geeks out" or gets quite excited about a fandom.

===Fanon===
Fanon is an idea that is widely believed to be true among fans, but is unconfirmed, preventing it from being labelled as canon. Fanon may refer to a whole interpretation of the original work, or to specific details within it.

===Headcanon===
Headcanon is a fan's personal, idiosyncratic interpretation of canon, such as the backstory of a character, or the nature of relationships between characters. It may represent a teasing out of subtext present in the canon, or it may directly contradict canon. If many other fans share this interpretation, it may become fanon.

===Mary Sue===
Also of note is the concept of the "[[Mary Sue]]", a term credited as originating in ''[[Star Trek]]'' fan fiction that has crossed over to the mainstream, at least among editors and writers. In early ''Trek'' fan fiction, a common plot was that of a minor member of the USS ''Enterprise''{{'}}s crew saving the life of Captain Kirk or Mister Spock, often being rewarded with a sexual relationship as a result. The term "Mary Sue", originating in a parody of stories in this [[wish fulfillment]] genre, thus tends to refer to an idealized or fictional character lacking flaws, often representing the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Segall |year=2008 |title=Fan Fiction Writing: New Work Based on Favorite Fiction |publisher=Rosen Pub. |page=26 |isbn=1404213562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===OTP===
An abbreviation of the term "one true pairing", where the author or reader ships (wishes for a romantic relationship between) certain characters from a fandom. Additionally, OTPs are also subsetted as OT3s, which reference the reader's one true bonding with three people; this number can be changed to refer to larger bondings.

===RPF===
An abbreviation of "real person fanfiction". Describes fanfiction-like works written about real people, usually celebrities, instead of fictional characters.

===SI===
An abbreviation of self-insert, usually referring to either a story in the eponymous genre or to the author avatar within one.

===TW===
An abbreviation of "[[trauma trigger|trigger warning]]". Trigger warnings are meant to warn people of content in fics that could be harmful or "triggering" to those who have dealt with situations such as abuse. Fan fiction is tagged using various TWs so that readers may prepare for or avoid certain content. Sometimes CW, an abbreviation of "content warning", is used instead of or in addition to a TW. Trigger warnings are usually inserted when the subject matter of a work deals with things issues like drug abuse, mental illness, abuse, or extreme violence.

==Interactivity in the online era==
Reviews can be given by both anonymous and registered users of most sites, and sites are often programmed to notify the author of new feedback, making them a common way for readers and authors online to communicate directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fanfiction.net/secure/review.php?storyid=3058878&amp;chapter=1&amp;storytextid=9301416' |title=Fanfiction.Net Review Form |publisher=[[Fanfiction.net]] |accessdate=April 24, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is intended for a type of bond between the reader and the writer, as well as helping the author improve their writing skills through [[constructive criticism]], enabling their to produce a better work next time.&lt;ref name="Merlin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://firefox.org/news/articles/650/11/Dr-Merlin039s-Guide-to-Fanfiction/Page11.html |title=Dr. Merlin's Guide to Fanfiction |author=Merlin, Missy |publisher=[[Firefox]] |date=September 13, 2007 |accessdate=May 7, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523223635/http://firefox.org/news/articles/650/11/Dr-Merlin039s-Guide-to-Fanfiction/Page11.html |archivedate=May 23, 2008 |df= }}{{Unreliable source?|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, unmoderated review systems are abused to send [[Flaming (Internet)|flames]], [[spam (electronic)|spam]], or [[Internet troll|trolling]] messages. As a result, the author of the story can either disable or enable anonymous reviews, depending on their preference. Internet fan fiction gives young writers a wider audience for their literary efforts than ever before, resulting in improved literacy.&lt;ref&gt;Tosenberger, Catherine (2008) "Homosexuality at the Online Hogwarts: Harry Potter Slash Fanfiction" ''Children's Literature'' 36 pp. 185-207 {{doi|10.1353/chl.0.0017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
{{Main|Legal issues with fan fiction}}
Fan fiction is a [[derivative work]] under [[United States copyright law]].&lt;ref name="legal-derivativeWork"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whoosh.org/issue25/lee1a.html#41 |title=What's "Derivative Work?" |work=A Brief Introduction to Copyright for Fanfiction Authors |author=Lee, A.T. |publisher=Woosh! |date=October 1998 |accessdate=April 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that fan fiction does not fall under [[fair use]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6673573.html Burns, Elizabeth, and Webbr, Carlie. "When Harry Met Bella: Fan fiction is all the rage. But is it plagiarism? Or the perfect thing to encourage young writers?" ''[[School Library Journal]]'', 8/1/2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805092320/http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6673573.html |date=2009-08-05 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2009 ruling by [[United States District Court]] judge Deborah A. Batts, permanently prohibiting publication in the United States of a book by Ryan Cassidy, a Swedish writer whose protagonist is a 76-year-old version of [[Holden Caulfield]] of ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'', may be seen as upholding this position regarding publishing fan fiction, as the judge stated, "To the extent Defendants contend that 60 Years and the character of Mr. C direct parodied comment or criticism at ''Catcher'' or Holden Caulfield, as opposed to Salinger himself, the Court finds such contentions to be post-hoc rationalizations employed through vague generalizations about the alleged naivety of the original, rather than reasonably perceivable parody."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chan |first=Sewell |url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/01/judge-rules-for-salinger-in-copyright-suit/?hp |title=Chan, Sewell.

Others such as the [[Organization for Transformative Works]] uphold the legality of non-profit fan fiction under the fair use doctrine, as it is a creative, [[Transformation (law)|transformative]] process.&lt;ref name="legal-fairUse"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions - Legal |publisher=[[Organization for Transformative Works]] |url=http://transformativeworks.org/faq/legal |accessdate=September 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001030602/http://transformativeworks.org/faq/legal |archivedate=October 1, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, [[Lucasfilm]] Ltd. sent out a letter to several [[fanzine]] publishers, asserting Lucasfilm's copyright to all [[List of Star Wars characters|''Star Wars'' characters]] and insisting that no fanzine publish [[pornography]]. The letter also alluded to possible legal action that could be taken against fanzines that did not comply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/cms/People/henry3/starwars.html |last=Jenkins |first=Henry |title=Quentin Tarantino's Star Wars?: Digital Cinema, Media Convergence, and Participatory Culture |year=2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309235553/http://web.mit.edu/cms/People/henry3/starwars.html |archivedate=March 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Harry Potter Lexicon is one case where the encyclopedia-like website about everything in the Harry Potter series, moved towards publishing and commercializing the Lexicon as a supplementary and complementary source of information to the series. Rowling and her publishers levied a lawsuit against the website creator, Steven Vander Ark, and the publishing company, RDR Books, for a breach of copyright. While the lawsuit did conclude in Vander Ark's favor, the main issue in contention was the majority of the Lexicon copied a majority of the Series' material and does not transform enough of the material to be held separately from the series itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwabach|first=Aaron|title=The Harry Potter Lexicon and the World of Fandom: Fan Fiction, Outsider Works and, Copyright|journal=University of Pittsburgh Law Review|year=2009|volume=70|issue=3|pages=387–434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the HP Lexicon case is an example of Western culture treatment of fan fiction and copyright law, in China, Harry Potter fan fiction is less addressed in legal conflicts but is used as a cultural and educational tool between Western and Chinese cultures. More specifically, while there are a number of "fake" Harry Potter books in China, most of these books are treated as addressing concepts and issues found in Chinese culture. This transformative usage of Harry Potter in fan fiction is mainly from the desire to enhance and express value to Chinese tradition and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gupta |first=Suman |title=Re-Reading Harry Potter 2nd Ed. |year=2009 |publisher=Basingstoke (UK); New York (US): Palgrave Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some prominent authors have given their blessings to fan fiction, notably [[J.K. Rowling]]. Rowling said she was "flattered" that people wanted to write their own stories based on her fictional characters.&lt;ref name="bcc-rowling"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/3753001.stm |title=Rowling backs Potter fan fiction |author=Waters, Darren |publisher=BBC |date=May 27, 2004 |accessdate=April 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Stephenie Meyer]] has put links on her website to fan fiction sites about her characters from the [[Twilight (novel series)|''Twilight'' series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stepheniemeyer.com/ts_fansites.html |title=Twilight Series Fansites |publisher=StephenieMeyer.com |accessdate=October 5, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006021434/http://stepheniemeyer.com/ts_fansites.html |archivedate=October 6, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fifty Shades (novel series)|''Fifty Shades'' trilogy]] was developed from a ''Twilight'' fan fiction originally titled ''Master of the Universe'' and published episodically on fan-fiction websites under the pen name "Snowqueen's Icedragon". The piece featured characters named after Stephenie Meyer's characters in ''Twilight'', [[Edward Cullen]] and [[Bella Swan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=mediabistro.com|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/fifty-shades-of-grey-wayback-machine_b49124|title=The Lost History of ''Fifty Shades of Grey''|author=GalleyCat|access-date=2015-06-30|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140727045638/http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/fifty-shades-of-grey-wayback-machine_b49124|archive-date=2014-07-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=mtv.com |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1685954/fifty-shades-of-grey-stephenie-meyer.jhtml |title=''Fifty Shades of Grey'': Stephenie Meyer Speaks Out |publisher=MTV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example of changing views on the subject, author [[Orson Scott Card]] (best known for the ''[[Enders Game]]'' series) once stated on his website, "to write fiction using my characters is morally identical to moving into my house without invitation and throwing out my family." He changed his mind completely and since has assisted fan fiction contests, arguing to the ''Wall Street Journal'' that "Every piece of fan fiction is an ad for my book. What kind of idiot would I be to want that to disappear?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Romano |first=Aja |url=http://www.salon.com/2013/05/07/sci_fi_icon_orson_scott_card_hates_fan_fiction_the_homosexual_agenda_partner/ |title=Orson Scott Card’s long history of homophobia |publisher=Salon.com |date=2013-05-07 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Anne Rice]] has consistently and aggressively prevented fan fiction based on any of her fictional characters (mostly those from her famous ''[[Interview with the Vampire]]'' and its sequels in ''[[The Vampire Chronicles]]''). She, along with [[Anne McCaffrey]] (whose stance has been changed by her son, Todd McCaffrey, since her death) and [[Raymond Feist]], have asked to have any fiction related to their series removed from FanFiction.Net.&lt;ref name="bcc-rowling"/&gt; [[George R.R. Martin]], who was selected by ''Time'' magazine as one of the "2011 Time 100" and is most famous for his epic fantasy series, ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'', is also strongly opposed to fan fiction, believing it to be copyright infringement and a bad exercise for aspiring writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://georgerrmartin.com/faq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions - George R.

'''Feminist art criticism''' emerged in the 1970s from the wider [[feminist movement]] as the critical examination of both visual representations of women in art and art [[women artists|produced by women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deepwell|first=Katie|title=12 Step Guide to Feminist Art, Art History and Criticism|journal=n.paradoxa|date=Sep 2012|volume=online|issue=21|page=8|url=http://www.ktpress.co.uk/pdf/nparadoxaissue21.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to be a major field of [[art criticism]].

== Emergence ==
[[Linda Nochlin]]'s 1971 groundbreaking essay, "[[Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?]]", analyzes the embedded privilege in the predominantly white, male, Western art world and argued that women's outsider status allowed them a unique viewpoint to not only critique women's position in art, but to additionally examine the discipline's underlying assumptions about gender and ability.&lt;ref name="Nochlin women artists"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nochlin|first=Linda|author-link=Linda Nochlin|title=Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?| work = Women, Art and Power and Other Essays | year=1971 |publisher= Westview Press|url=|accessdate = 2014-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nochlin's essay develops the argument that both formal and social education restricted artistic development to men, preventing women (with rare exception) from honing their talents and gaining entry into the art world.&lt;ref name="Nochlin women artists" /&gt; In the 1970s, feminist art criticism continued this critique of the institutionalized sexism of art history, art museums, and galleries, as well as questioning which genres of art were deemed museum-worthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Atkins |first1= Robert |author-link1= |year= 2013|title= Artspeak: A Guide to Contemporary Ideas, Movements, and Buzzwords, 1945 to the Present |edition= 3rd|location= New York|publisher= Abbeville Press |isbn= 9780789211507 |oclc=855858296}}&lt;/ref&gt; This position is articulated by artist [[Judy Chicago]]: "...it is crucial to understand that one of the ways in which the importance of male experience is conveyed is through the art objects that are exhibited and preserved in our museums. Whereas men experience presence in our art institutions, women experience primarily absence, except in images that do not necessarily reflect women's own sense of themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chicago|first1=Judy|author-link1=Judy Chicago|last2=Lucie-Smith|first2=Edward|author-link2=Edward Lucie-Smith|title=Women and Art: Contested Territory|year=1999|publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications|location=New York|isbn=0-8230-5852-2|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genius===
Nochlin challenges the myth of the Great Artist as 'Genius' as an inherently problematic construct. '[[Genius]]' “is thought of as an atemporal and mysterious power somehow embedded in the person of the Great Artist.”&lt;ref name="Nochlin women artists" /&gt;
This ‘god-like’ conception of the artist’s role is due to "the entire romantic, elitist, individual-glorifying, and monograph-producing substructure upon which the profession of art history is based."&lt;ref name="Nochlin women artists" /&gt; She develops this further by arguing that "if women had the golden nugget of artistic genius, it would reveal itself. But it has never revealed itself. Q.E.D. Women do not have the golden nugget of artistic genius."&lt;ref name="Nochlin women artists" /&gt; Nochlin deconstructs the myth of the 'Genius' by highlighting the unjustness in which the Western art world inherently privileges certain predominantly white male artists. In Western art, ‘Genius’ is a title that is generally reserved for artists such as, van Gogh, Picasso, Raphael, and Pollock—all white men.&lt;ref name="Nochlin women artists" /&gt; As recently demonstrated by Alessandro Giardino, when the concept of artistic genius started collapsing, women and marginal groups emerged at the forefront of artistic creation.&lt;ref&gt; Alessandro Giardino, ''[https://www.academia.edu/35257521/_Caravaggio_and_the_Enfranchisement_of_Women._New_Discoveries_Theory_in_Action_2017 "Caravaggio and the Enfranchisement of Women. New Discoveries"_]'', 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum organizations===
Similar to Nochlins’ assertions on women’s position in the art world, art historian [[Carol Duncan]] in the 1989 article, “The MoMA Hot Mamas”, examines the idea that institutions like the [[MoMA]] are masculinized. In MoMA’s collection, there is a disproportionate amount of sexualized female bodies by male artists on display compared to a low percentage of actual women artists included.&lt;ref name="Duncan MoMA"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/776968?uid=3739400&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3737720&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21104799788381 | title=The MoMA Hot Mamas | work=Art Journal | date=1998 | accessdate=2014-11-28 | last=Duncan | first=Carol | pages=171–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to data accumulated by the Guerrilla Girls, “less than 3% of the artists in the Modern Art section of New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art are women, but 83% of the nudes are female”, even though “51% of visual artists today are women.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Get the Facts|work = National Museum of Women in the Arts |url= http://nmwa.org/advocate/get-facts |accessdate = 2014-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duncan claims that, in regards to women artists:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the MoMA and other museums, their numbers are kept well below the point where they might effectively dilute its masculinity. The female presence is necessary only in the form of imagery. Of course, men, too, are occasionally represented. Unlike women, who are seen primarily as sexually accessible bodies, men are portrayed as physically and mentally active beings who creatively shape their world and ponder its meanings.&lt;ref name="Duncan MoMA" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This article narrows its focus on one institution to use as an example to draw from and expand on. Ultimately to illustrate the ways in which institutions are complicit in patriarchal and racist ideologies.

=== Intersectionality ===

Women of color in the art world were often not addressed in earlier feminist art criticism. An intersectional analysis that includes not only gender but also race and other marginalized identities is essential.

[[Audre Lorde]]’s 1984 essay “[http://www.muhlenberg.edu/media/contentassets/pdf/campuslife/sdp%20reading%20lorde.pdf The Master’s Tools Will Never Dismantle The Master’s House],” briefly addresses a vital dilemma that artists who are women of color are often overlooked or tokenized in the visual arts. She argues that "in academic feminist circles, the answer to these questions is often, ‘We did not know who to ask.’ But that is the same evasion of responsibility, the same cop-out, that keeps Black women's art out of women's exhibitions, Black women's work out of most feminist publications except for the occasional ‘Special Third World Women's Issue,’ and Black women's texts off your reading lists.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite| last = Lorde| first = Audre| author-link = Audre Lorde | title = The Master’s Tools Will Never Dismantle The Master’s House| work = [[Sister Outsider]]: Essays and Speeches| year=1984|publisher=Crossing Press|location=Berkeley|pages=110–114|accessdate = 2014-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorde’s statement brings up how important it is to consider intersectionality in these feminist art discourses, as race is just as integral to any discussion on gender.

Furthermore, [[bell hooks]] expands on the discourse of black representation in the visual arts to include other factors. In her 1995 book, ''Art on My Mind'', hooks positions her writings on the visual politics of both race and class in the art world. She states that the reason art is rendered meaningless in the lives of most black people is not solely due to the lack of representation, but also because of an entrenched colonization of the mind and imagination and how it is intertwined with the process of identification.&lt;ref name="hooks Art"&gt;{{Cite book| last =hooks| first = bell| author-link = bell hooks | date=1995|title = Art on My Mind: Visual Politics|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/31737494|location= New York|publisher= New Press|isbn= 9781565842632|accessdate = 2014-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} Thus she stresses for a “shift [in] conventional ways of thinking about the function of art.

== Intersection with other schools of thought ==
Feminist art criticism is a smaller subgroup in the larger realm of [[feminist theory]], because feminist theory seeks to explore the themes of [[discrimination]], [[sexual objectification]], [[oppression]], [[patriarchy]], and [[stereotyping]], feminist art criticism attempts similar exploration.

This exploration can be accomplished through a variety of means. [[Structuralism|Structuralist theories]], [[deconstructionist]] thought, [[psychoanalysis]], [[Queer theory|queer analysis]], and [[semiotic]] interpretations can be used to further comprehend gender symbolism and representation in artistic works. The social structures regarding gender that influence a piece can be understood through interpretations based on stylistic influences and biographical interpretations.

=== Freudian Psychoanalytic Theory ===

[[Laura Mulvey]]'s 1975 essay, "[[Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema]]" focuses on the gaze of the spectator from a Freudian perspective. Freud's concept of [[scopophilia]] relates to the objectification of women in art works. The gaze of the viewer is, in essence, a sexually charged instinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last= Mulvey|first= Laura|author-link= Laura Mulvey|editor1-first= Karyn|editor1-last= Kay|editor2-first= Gerald|editor2-last= Peary|editor2-link= Gerald Peary|encyclopedia= Women and the Cinema: A Critical Anthology|title= Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema|year= 1977|publisher= Dutton|location= New York|isbn= 0525474595|oclc= 3315936}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the gender inequity that exists in the art sphere, the artist's portrayal of a subject is generally a man's portrayal of women. Other [[Freudian]] symbolism can be used to comprehend pieces of art from a feminist perspective—whether gender specific symbols are uncovered through psychoanalytic theory (such as [[phallic]] or [[yonic]] symbols) or specific symbols are used to represent women in a given piece.

=== Realism and Reflectionism ===
Are the women depicted in an artistic work realistic portrayals of women? Writer [[Toril Moi]] explained in her 1985 essay "'Images of Women' Criticism" that "reflectionism posits that the artist's selective creation should be measured against 'real life,' thus assuming that the only constraint on the artist's work is his or her perception of the 'real world.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last= Moi|first= Toril|author-link= Toril Moi|editor-first= Moi|editor-last= Toril|editor-link= Toril Moi|encyclopedia= Sexual/Textual Politics: Feminist Literary Theory|title= 'Images of women’ criticism|year= 1985|publisher= Methuen|location= London|isbn= 0416353606|oclc= 12103885|pages= 42ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Journals and publication ==
The 1970s also saw the emergence of feminist art journals, including ''The Feminist Art Journal'' in 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art: Feminist Timeline: United States|url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/feminist_timeline/plain_text.php|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Heresies: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics|Heresies]]'' in 1977. The journal ''[[n.paradoxa]]'' has been dedicated to an international perspective on feminist art since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ktpress.co.uk/feminist-art-magazines.asp A List of Past and Present Feminist Art Journals on n.paradoxa's information pages]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beyond the academy ==
In 1989, the [[Guerrilla Girls|Guerilla Girls]]' poster protest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HOW WOMEN GET MAXIMUM EXPOSURE IN ART MUSEUMS|url=http://www.guerrillagirls.com/posters/getnaked.shtml|accessdate=1 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125204514/http://www.guerrillagirls.com/posters/getnaked.shtml|archivedate=25 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]'s gender imbalance brought this feminist critique out of the academy and into the public sphere.

===Exhibition===
In 2007, the exhibit "[[WACK! Art and the Feminist Revolution]]" presented works of 120 international artists and artists’ groups at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Johnson| first = Ken| author-link1 = Ken Johnson (art critic)|title = WACK!: Art and the Feminist Revolution - Art - Review| work = New York Times| accessdate = 2014-11-28| date = 2008-02-15| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/15/arts/design/15wack.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first show of its kind that employed a comprehensive view of the intersection between feminism and art from the late 1960s to the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="Ozler Wack"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Ozler| first = Levent| title = Wack!: Art and the Feminist Revolution| work = Dexigner| accessdate = 2014-11-28| date = 2007-02-16| url = https://www.dexigner.com/news/10312}}&lt;/ref&gt; WACK! “argues that feminism was perhaps the most influential of any postwar art movement-on an international level-in its impact on subsequent generations of artists.”&lt;ref name="Ozler Wack" /&gt;

== Today ==
Rosemary Betteron’s 2003 essay, “Feminist Viewing: Viewing Feminism”, insists that older feminist art criticism must adapt to newer models, as our culture has shifted significantly since the late twentieth century. Betterton points out:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Feminist art criticism is no longer the marginalized discourse that it once was; indeed it had produced some brilliant and engaging writing over the last decade and in many ways has become a key site of academic production. But, as feminist writers and teachers, we need to address ways of thinking through new forms of social engagement between feminism and the visual, and of understanding the different ways in which visual culture is currently inhabited by our students.&lt;ref name="Betterton Feminist"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Betterton| first = Rosemary| title = Feminist Viewing: Viewing Feminism| work = The Feminist Visual Cultural Reader| year=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=London|pages=11–14|accessdate = 2014-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Betterton, the models used to critique a Pre-Raphaelite painting are not likely to be applicable in the twenty-first century.&lt;ref name="Betterton Feminist" /&gt; She also expresses that we should explore ‘difference’ in position and knowledge, since in our contemporary visual culture we are more used to engaging with "multi-layered text and image complexes" (video, digital media, and the Internet).&lt;ref name="Betterton Feminist" /&gt; Our ways of viewing have changed considerably since the 1970s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1542">'''Figurative Constructivism''' is an art movement that arose principally in Germany. The term was introduced by [[Franz Seiwert]] in 1929 using the phrase "gegenständlichen constructive", and this was subsequently taken up by [[Gerd Arntz]] and then by art historians more generally.&lt;ref name=BB&gt;Benus B. (2013) 'Figurative Constructivism and sociological graphics' in ''Isotype: Design and Contexts 1925-71'' London: Hyphen Press, pp.216-248&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely related to the development of the [[Isotype (picture language)|Isotype]]. As Seiwert wrote "From the expressionist-cubist art-form abstract constructivism was developed, which in turn led into Figurative Constructivism".&lt;ref name=Kap&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kapounová|first1=Eliška|title=Grafická tvorba Augustina Tschinkela v kontextu moderního designu (1928 – 1940)|url=https://is.muni.cz/th/110838/ff_b/bak_Tschinkel_muni.pdf|publisher=Masarykova univerzita|accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''a bis z''==
In October 1929 Seiwert, [[Heinrich Hoerle]] and [[Walter Stern (art critic)|Walter Stern]] produced the first issue of ''A bis Z'', subtitled "organ of the progressive artists group". It featured five artists from four towns: Seiwert and Hoerle ([[Cologne]]), [[Augustin Tschinkel]] ([[Prague]]), [[Peter Alma]] [[Amsterdam]] and Arntz ([[Vienna]]).&lt;ref name=BB/&gt; Tschinkel and Alma were both colleagues of Arntz at the [[Gesellschafts- und Wirtschaftsmuseum]] run by [[Otto Neurath]] in Vienna.&lt;ref name=BB/&gt;

In [[popular culture]], '''formula fiction''' is [[literature]] in which the storylines and [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]s have been reused to the extent that the [[narrative]]s are predictable.  It is similar to [[genre fiction]], which identifies a number of specific settings that are frequently reused.  The label of ''formula fiction'' is used in [[literary criticism]] as a mild [[pejorative]] to imply lack of originality.

Formula fiction is similar to genre fiction. The label of genre fiction is typically assigned because of the reuse of settings, content, layout, and/or style. The label of formula fiction is assigned because of the reuse of plot, [[plot device]]s and [[stock character]]s.

Genres like [[high fantasy]], [[Western movie|Westerns]] and [[science fiction]] [[space opera]] often have specific settings, such as a pseudo-[[Medieval Europe]]an setting, the [[Old West]], or [[outer space]].  Approaching a given genre, certain assumed background information covers the nature and purpose of possible predictable elements of the story, such as the appearance of [[European dragon|dragon]]s and [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]]s in [[high fantasy]], [[Faster than light|warp drives]] in [[science fiction]], or [[shootout]]s at high noon in [[Western movie|Westerns]]. These set-ups are taken for granted by the genre conventions, and need not be explained for the reader anew, though these elements can easily be treated subversively as well, playing with some of the preconceptions inherent in formula fiction.

The ''formula'' is defined specifically by predictable [[narrative structure]]. Formulaic tales incorporate plots that have been reused so often as to be easily recognizable. Perhaps the most clearly formulaic plots characterize the [[romantic comedy]] genre; in a book or film labeled as such, viewers already know its most basic central plot, including to some extent the ending. This does not always prove to be detrimental to a given work's reception however, as the popularity of the aforementioned genre demonstrates.

''Formula fiction'' should not be confused with ''[[pastiche]]'' (the mimicking of another work or author's style), though the latter by its nature may include elements of the former; the same holds true of some [[parody]] and [[satire|satirical]] works as well, which may well include formulaic elements such as common [[stereotype]]s or [[caricature]]s, or which may use formulaic elements in order to mock them or point out their supposedly [[cliché]] or [[realism (arts)|unrealistic]] nature. Indeed, between [[parody]], [[satire]] and such [[subgenre]]s as romantic comedy, [[comedy]] as a whole often relies on either formulaic elements, or the mocking of such elements.

Formula fiction is often stereotypically associated with early [[pulp magazine]] markets, though some works published in that medium, such as "[[The Cold Equations]]", subvert the supposed expectations of the common narrative formula of that time.

The dissection and tracking of common formulaic [[Trope (literature)|trope]]s (as well as their subversions and new permutations) has become reasonably popular beyond strictly academic circles. (The [[Final Girl]] being one such example, as well as, to some extent, Campbell's ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''). [[Amateur]] circles have websites such as the [[TV Tropes|TV Tropes Wiki]].

[[File:Freitag der 13. im Kalender.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Friday the 13th in a [[calendar]]]]
'''Friday the 13th''' is considered an unlucky day in [[Western culture|Western]] [[superstition]]. It occurs when the 13th day of the month in the [[Gregorian calendar]] falls on a [[Friday]], which happens at least once every year but can occur up to three times in the same year,&lt;ref name="timeanddate.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/weekday-friday-13|title=Months and Years having Friday the 13th|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;for example in 2015, on 13 Feb, 13 March and 13 October. In 2017, it occurred twice, on 13 January and 13 October. In 2018, it also occurred twice, on 13 April and 13 July.&lt;ref name="timeanddate.com2" /&gt; There will be two Friday the 13ths every year until 2020; 2021 and 2022 will have just one occurrence each.

A Friday the 13th occurs during any month that begins on a Sunday.

==History==
The fear of the number 13 has been given a scientific name: "[[triskaidekaphobia]]"; and on analogy to this the fear of Friday the 13th is called  ''paraskevidekatriaphobia'', from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''Paraskeví'' (Παρασκευή, meaning "Friday"), and ''dekatreís'' (δεκατρείς, meaning "thirteen").&lt;ref name=mathworld&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Triskaidekaphobia.html |title=Triskaidekaphobia on MathWorld |accessdate=14 August 2010 |author=Weisstein, Eric W |publisher=[[MathWorld]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Última Cena - Da Vinci 5.jpg|thumb|350px|right|''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Last Supper]]'' by Leonardo da Vinci]]

The superstition surrounding this day may have arisen in the [[Middle Ages]], "originating from the story of Jesus' [[last supper]] and [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]]" in which there were 13 individuals present in the [[Upper Room]] on the 13th of Nisan [[Maundy Thursday]], the night before his death on [[Good Friday]].&lt;ref name=DellaContrada&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buffalo.edu/news/releases/2004/02/6576.html |title=Fear of "Friday the 13th may likely have originated from Jesus' Last Supper and Crucifixion", Says UB Anthropologist |last=DellaContrada |first=John |date=9 February 2004 |publisher=[[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York]] |accessdate=13 July 2014 |quote=There were 13 people at the [[upper room|table]] (at the [[Last Supper]]) and the 13th was [[Jesus]].

[[Friday]] has been considered an unlucky day to undertake journeys or begin new projects at least since the 14th century, as witnessed by Chaucer's ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and the number 13 being considered unlucky, there is no record of the two items being referred to as especially unlucky in conjunction before the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Lachenmeyer&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/13.html?id=sDXJ1s0YNAgC Nathaniel Lachenmeyer, ''13: The Story of the World's Most Popular Superstition''] ch. 5 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NatGeo/&gt;&lt;ref name=western&gt;{{cite journal |author=Clar, Mimi |journal=Western Folklore |year=1957 |title=Friday the 13th |pages=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early documented reference in English occurs in [[Henry Sutherland Edwards]]' 1869 biography of [[Gioachino Rossini]], who died on a Friday 13th:
&lt;blockquote&gt;He [Rossini] was surrounded to the last by admiring friends; and if it be true that, like so many Italians, he regarded Fridays as an unlucky day and thirteen as an unlucky number, it is remarkable that on Friday 13th of November he passed away.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Sutherland Edwards, ''The Life of Rossini'', Blackett, 1869, p.340.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Rossini by Grevedon.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] by Henri Grevedon]]
It is  possible that the publication in 1907 of [[Thomas W. Lawson (businessman)|Thomas W. Lawson]]'s popular novel ''Friday, the Thirteenth'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomas W. Lawson |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12345/12345-h/12345-h.htm |title=Thomas W. Lawson, '&amp;#39;Friday, the Thirteenth'&amp;#39; (1907) |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date= |accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; contributed to disseminating the superstition. In the novel, an unscrupulous [[broker]] takes advantage of the superstition to create a [[Wall Street]] panic on a Friday the 13th.&lt;ref name=Lachenmeyer/&gt;

A suggested origin of the superstition—Friday, 13 October 1307, the date [[Philip IV of France]]  [[Knights Templar#Arrests, charges and dissolution|arrested]] hundreds of the [[Knights Templar]]—may not have been formulated until the [[20th century]]. It is mentioned in the 1955 [[Maurice Druon]] historical novel ''[[The Iron King]]'' (''Le Roi de fer''), [[John J. Robinson]]'s 1989 work ''Born in Blood: The Lost Secrets of Freemasonry'',  [[Dan Brown]]'s 2003 novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' and [[Steve Berry (novelist)|Steve Berry]]'s ''[[The Templar Legacy]]'' (2006).&lt;ref name=mathworld/&gt;&lt;ref name=Snopes&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.snopes.com/luck/friday13.asp |title=Friday the 13th |accessdate=26 March 2007 |work=snopes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=why&gt;{{cite web|url=http://urbanlegends.about.com/cs/historical/a/friday_the_13th_4.htm |title=Why Friday the 13th Is Unlucky |publisher=Urbanlegends.about.com |date= |accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tuesday the 13th in Hispanic and Greek culture==
In [[List of countries where Spanish is an official language|Spanish-speaking countries]], instead of Friday, Tuesday the 13th (''martes trece'') is considered a day of bad luck.&lt;ref name="Falcón"&gt;Rafael Falcón, Christine Yoder Falcón [https://books.google.com/books?id=os7DMzXq1rcC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=Tuesday+the+13th+is+considered+bad+luck&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Tuesday%20the%2013th%20is%20considered%20bad%20luck&amp;f=false ''Salsa: a taste of Hispanic culture''], p. 64, Praeger (1998), {{ISBN|0-275-96121-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Greece|Greeks]] also consider Tuesday (and especially the 13th) an unlucky day.&lt;ref name=GR&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chrysopoulos |first1=Philip |title=Why Superstitious Greeks Fear Tuesday the 13th |url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/10/13/why-superstitious-greeks-fear-tuesday-the-13th/ |publisher=Greek Reporter |accessdate=31 October 2016 |date=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tuesday is considered dominated by the influence of Ares, the god of war ([[Mars_(mythology)|''Mars'']] in Roman mythology). The fall of Constantinople to the [[Fourth Crusade]] occurred on [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|Tuesday, April 13, 1204]], and the [[Fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] happened on Tuesday, 29 May 1453, events that strengthen the superstition about Tuesday. In addition, in [[Greek language|Greek]] the name of the day is '''Triti''' (''Τρίτη'') meaning the third (day of the week), adding weight to the superstition, since bad luck is said to "come in threes".&lt;ref name=GR/&gt;

Tuesday the 13th occurs in a month that begins on a Thursday.

==Friday the 17th in Italy==
In [[Italy|Italian]] popular culture, Friday the 17th (and not the 13th) is considered a day of bad luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.lastampa.it/domande-risposte/articolo/lstp/442871/|title=Venerdì 17 porta davvero sfortuna?|publisher=La Stampa|date=17 February 2012|author=Carlo Grande|accessdate=31 March 2012|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of this belief could be traced in the writing of number 17, in [[Roman numerals]]: XVII. By shuffling the digits of the number one can easily get the word VIXI ("I have lived", implying death in the present), an omen of bad luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/bad-omen-for-italy-as-their-unlucky-number-comes-up-400380.html |title=Bad omen for Italy as their unlucky number comes up |author=Nick Harris |date=15 November 2007 |website=[[The Independent]] |access-date=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, in Italy, 13 is generally considered a lucky number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cafebabel.it/article/24987/venerdi-13-17-fortuna-sfortuna-italia.html|title=Venerdì 13 porta (s)fortuna?

The 2000 parody film ''[[Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the Thirteenth]]'' was released in Italy with the title ''Shriek – Hai impegni per venerdì 17?'' ("''Shriek – Do You Have Something to Do on Friday the 17th?''").

Friday the 17th occurs on a month starting on Wednesday.

==Social impact==
According to the Stress Management Center and Phobia Institute in [[Asheville, North Carolina]], an estimated 17 to 21 million people in the [[United States]] are affected by a fear of this day, making it the most feared day and date in history. Some people are so paralyzed by fear that they avoid their normal routines in doing business, taking flights or even getting out of bed. "It's been estimated that [[United States dollar|[US]$]]800 or $900 million is lost in business on this day".&lt;ref name="NatGeo"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/02/0212_040212_friday13.html |title=Friday the 13th Phobia Rooted in Ancient History |accessdate=29 October 2008|date=12 August 2004|author=Roach, John |work=National Geographic News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, representatives for both [[Delta Air Lines]] and [[Continental Airlines]] (the latter now merged into United Airlines) have stated that their airlines do not suffer from any noticeable drop in travel on those Fridays.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Sens, "[http://www.viamagazine.com/travel-tips/friday-13th-lucky-or-unlucky Some Don't Count on lucky]", ''Via Magazine'', January 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Finland, a consortium of governmental and nongovernmental organizations led by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health promotes the [[National Accident Day (Finland)|National Accident Day]] (''kansallinen tapaturmapäivä'') to raise awareness about automotive safety, which always falls on a Friday the 13th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tyosuojelu.fi/fi/ajankohtaista/5757 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429045702/http://www.tyosuojelu.fi/fi/ajankohtaista/5757 |archivedate=29 April 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The event is coordinated by the Finnish Red Cross and has been held since 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kotitapaturma.fi/mika-on-tapaturmapaiva/|title=Mikä on Tapaturmapäivä?|last=|first=|date=|website=www.kotitapaturma.fi|language=fi|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers analyzed the traffic flow and number of injuries from car accidents on the southern section of London's M25 motorway during the five months that the 13th fell on a Friday between 1990 and 1992. They compared these numbers to data collected on Friday the 6th of the same months, and found that although there are consistently fewer vehicles on the road during the 13th — possibly as a result of superstitious people choosing not to drive that day, the researchers proposed — "the risk of hospital admission as a result of a transport accident may be increased by as much as 52 percent" on the 13th.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/1998/03/er_and_the_triple_hex.html|title=When a full moon and a lunar eclipse collide with Friday the 13th, do more accidents really happen?|date=20 March 1998|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|language=English|accessdate=13 April 2018|author=[[Atul Gawande]]|quote=The 1993 study, published in the British Medical Journal, compared hospital admissions for traffic accidents on a Friday the 13th with those on a Friday the 6th in a community outside London.

On the contrary, the Dutch Centre for Insurance Statistics on 12 June 2008 stated that "fewer accidents and reports of fire and theft occur when the 13th of the month falls on a Friday than on other Fridays, because people are preventatively more careful or just stay home. Statistically speaking, driving is slightly safer on Friday the 13th, at least in the [[Netherlands]]; in the last two years, Dutch insurers received reports of an average 7,800 traffic accidents each Friday; but the average figure when the 13th fell on a Friday was just 7,500."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/friday-13th-is-no-longer-unlucky-313210 Mirror.co.uk], "Friday 13th is no longer unlucky".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUKL1268660720080613|title=Friday 13th not more unlucky, Dutch study shows|first=Reuters|last=Editorial|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==
In years which begin on the same day of the week and are of the same type (that is, whether they are a [[common year]] or [[leap year]]), Friday the 13th occurs in the same months.

This sequence, given here for 1900–2099, follows a 28-year cycle from 1 March 1900 to 28 February 2100. The months with a Friday the 13th are determined by the [[Dominical letter]] (G, F, GF, etc.) of the year. Any month that starts on a Sunday contains a Friday the 13th, and there is at least one Friday the 13th in every calendar year. There can be as many as three Friday the 13ths in a single calendar year; either in February, March and November in a [[common year starting on Thursday]] (such as 2009, 2015 or 2026) [[Dominical letter|(D)]], or January, April and July in a [[leap year starting on Sunday]] (such as 2012) [[Dominical letter|(AG)]].

The longest period that occurs without a Friday the 13th is 14 months, either from July to September the following year being a [[common year starting on Tuesday]] [[Dominical letter|(F)]] (e.g. 2001/02, 2012/13 and 2018/19), or from August to October the following year being a [[leap year starting on Saturday]] [[Dominical letter|(BA)]] (e.g. 1999/2000 and 2027/28).

The shortest period that occurs with a Friday the 13th is just one month, from February to March in a [[common year starting on Thursday]] [[Dominical letter|(D)]] (e.g. 2009, 2015 and 2026).

Each [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] 400-year cycle contains 146,097 days (with 97 [[leap year|leap days]]) or exactly 20,871 weeks. Therefore, each cycle contains the same pattern of days of the week and thus the same pattern of Fridays that are on the 13th. The 13th day of the month is slightly more likely to be a Friday than any other day of the week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://x42.com/datelab/daydist.shtml|title=About the date+day-distribution along the epoch |date=13 November 1998 |author=Bodin, Magnus |work=x42 |access-date=30 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.H.

'''Genre painting''', also called '''petit genre''', depicts aspects of [[everyday life]] by portraying ordinary people engaged in common activities. One common definition of a '''genre scene''' is that it shows figures to whom no identity can be attached either individually or collectively—thus distinguishing ''petit genre'' from [[history painting]]s (also called ''grand genre'') and [[portrait]]s. A work would often be considered as a genre work even if it could be shown that the artist had used a known person—a member of his family, say—as a model. In this case it would depend on whether the work was likely to have been intended by the artist to be perceived as a portrait—sometimes a subjective question. The depictions can be realistic, imagined, or romanticized by the artist. Because of their familiar and frequently sentimental subject matter, genre paintings have often proven popular with the [[bourgeoisie]], or [[middle class]].
[[Image:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 014.jpg|thumb|280px|right|''Peasant Dance'', c. 1568, oil on wood, by [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Pieter Brueghel]] the Elder]]

Genre subjects appear in many traditions of art. Painted decorations in [[Art of Ancient Egypt|ancient Egyptian]] [[tomb]]s often depict banquets, recreation, and agrarian scenes, and [[Peiraikos]] is mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]] as a [[Hellenistic]] panel painter of "low" subjects, such as survive in [[mosaic]] versions and provincial wall-paintings at [[Pompeii]]: "barbers' shops, cobblers' stalls, asses, eatables and similar subjects".&lt;ref&gt;Book XXXV.112 of ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Medieval [[illuminated manuscripts]] often illustrated scenes of everyday peasant life, especially in the [[Labours of the Months]] in the calendar section of [[books of hours]], most famously the [[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]].

==To 1800==
[[File:Merry company, by Dirck Hals.jpg|thumb|''Merry Company'', a [[Merry company]] scene, by [[Dirck Hals]]]]

The [[Low Countries]] dominated the field until the 18th century, and in the 17th century both [[Flemish Baroque painting]] and [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] produced numerous specialists who mostly painted genre scenes.  In the previous century, the Flemish [[Renaissance]] painter [[Jan Sanders van Hemessen]] painted innovative large-scale genre scenes, sometimes including a moral theme or a religious scene in the background in the first half of the 16th century.  These were part of a pattern of "[[Mannerist]] inversion" in [[Antwerp]] painting, giving "low" elements previously in the decorative background of images prominent emphasis.  [[Joachim Patinir]] expanded [[landscape painting|his landscapes]], making the figures a small element, and [[Pieter Aertsen]] painted works dominated by spreads of [[still life]] food and genre figures of cooks or market-sellers, with small religious scenes in spaces in the background.  [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] made peasants and their activities, very naturalistically treated, the subject of many of his paintings, and genre painting was to flourish in Northern Europe in Brueghel's wake. 
[[File:Wybrand Hendriks - Interieur met naaiende vrouw.jpg|thumb|''Interior with Sewing Woman'', c. 1800-1810 by [[Wybrand Hendriks]] ]] [[Adriaen van Ostade|Adriaen]] and [[Isaac van Ostade]], [[Jan Steen]], [[Adriaan Brouwer]], [[David Teniers the Younger|David Teniers]], [[Aelbert Cuyp]], [[Johannes Vermeer]] and [[Pieter de Hooch]] were among the many painters specializing in genre subjects in the Low Countries during the 17th century. The generally small scale of these artists' paintings was appropriate for their display in the homes of middle class purchasers. Often the subject of a genre painting was based on a popular ''emblem'' from an [[Emblem book]]. This can give the painting a double meaning, such as in [[Gabriel Metsu]]'s [[:Image:Gabriel Metsu 003.jpg|''The Poultry seller'', 1662]], showing an old man offering a [[rooster]] in a symbolic pose that is based on a lewd engraving by Gillis van Breen (1595–1622), with the same scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/jong076erot01_01/jong076erot01_01_0001.htm | title=E. de Jongh, 'Erotica in vogelperspectief. De dubbelzinnigheid van een reeks zeventiende-eeuwse genrevoorstellingen'· dbnl |first=| last=DBNL| date=| website=DBNL |accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[merry company]]'' showed a group of figures at a party, whether making music at home or just drinking in a tavern. Other common types of scenes showed markets or fairs, village festivities ("kermesse"), or soldiers in camp.

[[File:Jean-Baptiste Greuze - Filial Piety - WGA10664.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]], ''Filial Piety'', 1765]]

In Italy, a "school" of genre painting was stimulated by the arrival in [[Rome]] of the Dutch painter [[Pieter van Laer]] in 1625. He acquired the nickname "Il Bamboccio" and his followers were called the ''[[Bamboccianti]]'', whose works would inspire [[Giacomo Ceruti]], [[Antonio Cifrondi]], and [[Giuseppe Maria Crespi]] among many others.

[[Le Nain|Louis le Nain]] was an important exponent of genre painting in 17th-century France, painting groups of peasants at home, where the 18th century would bring a heightened interest in the depiction of everyday life, whether through the [[romanticism|romanticized]] paintings of [[Antoine Watteau|Watteau]] and [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard|Fragonard]], or the careful [[realism (arts)|realism]] of [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin|Chardin]]. [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]] (1725–1805) and others painted detailed and rather sentimental groups or individual portraits of peasants that were to be influential on 19th-century painting.

In England, [[William Hogarth]] (1697–1764) conveyed comedy, social criticism and moral lessons through canvases that told stories of ordinary people ful of narrative detail (aided by long sub-titles), often in serial form, as in his ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'', first painted in 1732–33, then engraved and published in print form in 1735.

Spain had a tradition predating ''[[The Book of Good Love]]'' of social observation and commentary based on the Old Roman Latin tradition, practiced by many of its painters and [[illuminated manuscript|illuminators]].  At the height of the Spanish Empire and the beginning of its slow decline, many [[picaresque]] genre scenes of street life—as well as the kitchen scenes known as ''[[bodegones]]''—were painted by the artists of The [[Spanish Golden Age]], notably [[Velázquez]] (1599–1660) and [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]] (1617–82). More than a century later, the Spanish artist [[Francisco de Goya]] (1746–1828) used genre scenes in painting and [[printmaking]] as a medium for dark commentary on the human condition. His ''[[The Disasters of War]]'', a series of 82 genre incidents from the [[Peninsular War]], took genre art to unprecedented heights of expressiveness.

==19th century==
[[File:Wassilij Grigorjewitsch Perow 004.jpg|thumb|right|280px|[[Vasily Perov]], ''The Hunters at Rest'' (1871), [[Tretyakov Gallery]]]]
[[File:Jagerswoning Rijksmuseum SK-A-1157.jpeg|thumbnail|280px|[[Henry Voordecker]], ''[[Hunter's Home]]'' (1826)]]
[[File:1820-Country-Wedding-John-Lewis-Krimmel.jpg|thumb|280px|[[John Lewis Krimmel]], ''Country Wedding'' (1820)]]

With the decline of religious and historical painting in the 19th century, artists increasingly found their subject matter in the life around them. [[Realism (art)|Realists]] such as [[Gustave Courbet]] (1819–77) upset expectations by depicting everyday scenes in huge paintings—at the scale traditionally reserved for "important" subjects—thus blurring the boundary which had set genre painting apart as a "minor" category. Realist paintings on such a scale, and the new type showing people at work, emphasizing the effort involved, would not normally be called "genre paintings".  Both monumental scale and the depiction of exhausting work are exemplified by ''[[Barge Haulers on the Volga]]'' ([[Ilya Repin]], 1873). [[History painting]] itself shifted from the exclusive depiction of events of great public importance to the depiction of genre scenes in historical times, both the private moments of great figures, and the everyday life of ordinary people. In French art this was known as the [[Troubador style]].  This trend, already apparent by 1817 when [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]] painted ''Henri IV Playing with His Children'', culminated in the [[pompier]] art of French academicians such as [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] (1824–1904) and [[Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier]] (1815–91).  In the second half of the century interest in genre scenes, often in historical settings or with pointed social or moral comment, greatly increased across Europe.

[[William Powell Frith]] (1819–1909) was perhaps the most famous English genre painter of the Victorian era, painting large and extremely crowded scenes; the expansion in size and ambition in 19th-century genre painting was a common trend. Other 19th-century English genre painters include [[Augustus Leopold Egg]], [[Frederick Daniel Hardy]], [[George Elgar Hicks]], [[William Holman Hunt]] and [[John Everett Millais]].  Scotland produced two influential genre painters, [[David Allan (painter)|David Allan]] (1744–96) and [[David Wilkie (artist)|Sir David Wilkie]] (1785–1841). Wilkie's ''The Cottar's Saturday Night'' (1837) inspired a major work by the French painter [[Gustave Courbet]], ''[[After Dinner at Ornans]]'' (1849). Famous [[Russia]]n realist painters like [[Vasily Perov]] and [[Ilya Repin]] also produced genre paintings.

In Germany, [[Carl Spitzweg]] (1808–85) specialized in gently humorous genre scenes, and in Italy [[Gerolamo Induno]] (1825–90) painted scenes of military life. Subsequently, the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], as well as such 20th-century artists as [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Itshak Holtz]], [[Edward Hopper]], and [[David Park (painter)|David Park]] painted scenes of daily life. But in the context of modern art the term "genre painting" has come to be associated mainly with painting of an especially anecdotal or sentimental nature, painted in a traditionally realistic technique.

The first true genre painter in the United States was the German immigrant [[John Lewis Krimmel]], who learning from Wilkie and Hogarth, produced gently humorous scenes of life in Philadelphia from 1812–21. Other notable 19th-century genre painters from the United States include [[George Caleb Bingham]], [[William Sidney Mount]], and [[Eastman Johnson]]. [[Harry Roseland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safran-arts.com/42day/art/art4may/art0512.html|title=ART / 4 / 2DAY|first=John F.|last=Canu|date=|website=www.safran-arts.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; focused on scenes of poor African Americans in the post-American Civil War South,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/reprint/158/5/970.pdf{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Rogers (sculptor)|John Rogers]] (1829–1904) was a sculptor whose small genre works, mass-produced in cast plaster, were immensely popular in America.  The works of American painter [[Ernie Barnes]] (1938–2009) and those of illustrator [[Norman Rockwell]] (1894–1978) could exemplify a more modern type of genre painting.

[[File:Magnetic Hill, New Brunswick.JPG|thumb|Water appearing to run uphill at [[Magnetic Hill (Moncton)|Magnetic Hill]] in [[New Brunswick]]]]
A '''gravity hill''', also known as a '''magnetic hill''', '''mystery hill''', '''mystery spot''', '''gravity road''', or '''anti-gravity hill''', is a place where the layout of the surrounding land produces an [[optical illusion]], making a slight downhill slope appear to be an uphill slope. Thus, a car left out of gear will appear to be rolling uphill against [[gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/roll-uphill.html University of California Riverside article on phenomenon]&lt;/ref&gt; There are hundreds of recognised gravity hills around the world. 

The slope of gravity hills is an optical illusion,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bressan|first=Paola|last2=Garlaschelli|first2=Luigi|last3=Barracano|first3=Monica|date=2003|title=Antigravity Hills are Visual Illusions|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9280.02451|journal=Psychological Science|language=en|volume=14|issue=5|pages=441–449|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.02451|via=}} [https://zenodo.org/record/1006741#.Wdx33hhh1YI Free full text]&lt;/ref&gt; although sites are often accompanied by claims that [[magnetism|magnetic]] or [[supernatural]] forces are at work. The most important factor contributing to the illusion is a completely or mostly obstructed [[horizon]]. Without a horizon, it becomes difficult to judge the slope of a surface, as a reliable reference is missing. Objects one would normally assume to be more or less [[perpendicular]] to the ground (such as trees) may actually be leaning, offsetting the visual reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/videos/2006/0609-the_mysterious_gravity_hill.htm |publisher=Science Daily |website=ScienceDaily.com |title=The Mysterious Gravity Hill:Physicists Show "Antigravity" Mystery Spots Are Optical Illusions |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217004146/http://www.sciencedaily.com/videos/2006/0609-the_mysterious_gravity_hill.htm |archivedate=2008-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The illusion is similar to the [[Ames room]], in which objects can also appear to roll against gravity.
 
A similar phenomenon—an uphill road that appears flat—is known in [[bicycle racing]] as a "[[glossary of bicycling#F|false flat]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PCO8d0hhzK4C&amp;pg=PA114 |page= 114 |accessdate= July 20, 2013 |title= Cycling's Greatest Misadventures |editor1-first= Erich |editor1-last= Schweikher |editor2-first= Paul |editor2-last= Diamond |publisher= Casagrande Press LLC |year= 2007 |isbn= 978-0-9769516-2-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mutand dAguila Joan Castejon Wax on Paper 1982 100x81.jpg|thumb|220px|'Mutant eagle', wax on paper, by Joan Castejon.]]
The Grup d' Elx artists began their training in an precarious artistic scenario. Its activity was a task that built a bridge between modernity and vertebrate and radical vanguard, which for them was inseparable from a social transition out of the [[Francoist]] dictatorship.  In this sense, as the members of El Paso  or [[Dau al set]], the artists of the Grup d' Elx conducted an art in which there are several components that are part of a common denominator: primacy of intense expressiveness, intentional reduction of color to a minimum and, finally, the belief in an artistic poetics of engagement centered on human beings and their social situation. In fact, one of its most representative members, [[Joan Castejón]], was imprisoned for four years.&lt;ref name="Así era entonces."&gt;{{cite news

The group was inspired by the activity of other postwar artistic groups such as [[Dau al Set]] and [[Grup Parpalló]]. Members of Grup d'Elx included [[Joan Castejón]], Albert Agulló, Antoni Coll y Sixto Marco.

The group dissolved in 1973.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5559">'''Indigenous Futurisms''' is a movement consisting of art, literature, comics, games, and other forms of media which express Indigenous perspectives of the future, past, and present in the context of science fiction and related sub-genres. Such perspectives may reflect Indigenous ways of knowing, traditional stories, historical or contemporary politics or other cultural realities. 

Like [[Afrofuturism]], Indigenous futurism encapsulates multiple modes of art making from literature to visual arts, fashion and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guzmán|first1=Alicia Inez|title=Indigenous Futurisms|url=https://ivc.lib.rochester.edu/indigenous-futurisms/|website=InVisible Culture: An Electronic Journal for Visual Culture|publisher=University of Rochester|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by Grace Dillon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gaertner|first1=David|title=“WHAT’S A STORY LIKE YOU DOING IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?”: CYBERSPACE AND INDIGENOUS FUTURISM|url=https://novelalliances.com/2015/03/23/whats-a-story-like-you-doing-in-a-place-like-this-cyberspace-and-indigenous-futurism-in-neal-stephensons-snow-crash/#_ftn1|website=Novel Alliances: Allied Perspectives on Literature, Art and New Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor in the Indigenous Nations Studies Program at Portland State University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grace Dillon|url=https://www.pdx.edu/nas/grace-l-dillon-2|website=Portland State University|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous Futurisms critiques the historization of Indigenous people which is used to separate from them the contemporary world while challenging notions of what constitutes advanced technology &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thenewinquiry.com/the-space-ndns-star-map/|title=The Space NDN’s Star Map|last=Cornum|first=Lou Catherine|date=January 26, 2015|website=The New Inquiry|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5438">'''''Interdisciplinary Arts''''' is an academic department in the School of Media Arts at [[Columbia College Chicago]]. As one of the earliest interdisciplinary arts programs in the United States, it has been an incubator for new approaches towards art making that has shaped the development of arts professionals for over thirty-three years. Guided by the principle that [[interdisciplinarity]] "is a defining characteristic of contemporary art practice" &lt;ref&gt;Interdisciplinary Arts Department, [http://www.colum.edu/interarts/ "Interdisciplinary Arts Department Mission Statement"], Retrieved 6 Nov 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and "a necessary prerequisite for those artists who will shape the future of creative practice",&lt;ref&gt;Interdisciplinary Arts Department, [http://www.colum.edu/interarts/ "Interdisciplinary Arts Department Homepage"], Retrieved 6 Nov 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; the artists who work in the Interdisciplinary Arts department investigate new terrain.

Examining concepts, forms and techniques from across the fine, performing and media arts, students work with a diverse array of unique and experimental approaches that interrogate artist books, installations, gesture and movement, sound art, durational performance, interactive media, video, performance media, papermaking, letterpress, etching and offset printing, electronically controlled artworks, online artwork, performance in artificial spaces, democratic multiples, written, spoken and performed text, dramatic forms, DIY/DIT collaborative strategies and relational art forms.

== History ==
Interdisciplinary Arts was formulated in Chicago Il, 1976, by [[Suzanne Cohan-Lange]], Jean Unsworth, and Rebecca Ruben.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, Beverly T., In Non-Traditional, Interdisciplinary Study at Columbia College, Artists Get a Chance to Broaden Their Horizons, Hone Creativity, [http://www.eric.ed.gov:80/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ416792&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ416792 "Chronicle of Higher Education"], v37 n3 pA17,20 Sep 19 1990, {{ISSN|0009-5982}}, Retrieved 9 Nov 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally accepted by the Chicago Consortium of Colleges as a program taught across several universities, in 1981, it was established as a department with a permanent home at [[Columbia College Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;Columbia College Oral History Project, [http://www.lib.colum.edu/archives/oralhistory/index.php "Columbia College Oral History Project"], Retrieved 9 Nov 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the Interdisciplinary Arts MA program was formalized within the context of the department. Since then, two MFA degrees were added: the Interdisciplinary Book &amp; Paper Arts MFA, launched in 1994; and the Interdisciplinary Arts &amp; Media MFA, launched in 2002. The founding of the Interdisciplinary Arts program is preceded by the undergraduate program in the [[Studio for Interrelated Media]] program founded by [[Harris Barron]] in 1969 at the [[Massachusetts College of Art and Design]] in Boston.

==Programs==
The Interdisciplinary Arts MA is for art teachers who want to expand their repertoire of techniques, as well as assist practicing artists in expanding their practice to include new media. It is immersed in the five traditional art media that make up the heart of the program: visual art, movement, sound, writing, and drama.

The Interdisciplinary Book &amp; Paper Arts MFA program enables students to participate in the contemporary art world by encouraging them to consider book and paper as a site for interdisciplinary practice. It promotes the understanding of hand papermaking and the book arts as artistic media with applications in cultural discourse, community building, and collaborative practice.

The Interdisciplinary Arts &amp; Media MFA fosters an innovative dialog between the fine, performing and media arts. It is a graduate program for traditional and performing artists who want to incorporate media into their artistic practice and for media artists who want to expand into areas such as performance, installation, interactive, and relational art forms.

==Facilities==
In the 916 S. Wabash building are housed the departmental offices, faculty offices, conference room, lecture hall, two smart classrooms, large computer lab, three installation labs and the media equipment center. Additionally, the [[Center for Book and Paper Arts]] is part of the Interdisciplinary Arts department. The [[Center for Book and Paper Arts]] occupies the entire second floor of the historic [[Ludington Building]] at 1104 South Wabash and includes a papermaking studio, a letterpress facility, a bookbindery, a gallery, a smart classroom, a multi-purpose space for performance and lectures, a computer laboratory, a critique room, studio space for artists, a resource room, and offices for the staff.  Also at 1104 South Wabash are studio spaces for the MFA students.

==Identified fictional colors==
This is a '''list of fictional colors''' which were invented for a work of fiction.
*'''Actinic''' is a new use of an older word by [[Larry Niven]] in ''[[The Ringworld Engineers]]'' for the human sensation of color in vision-damaging ultraviolet light – for example, as seen in welding-torch light (see [[Actinism]]). The term "actinic light" was also used in E.E. Smith's [[Lensman series|''Lensmen'' series]] to describe UV light, and in the novel ''Forlorn Hope'' to describe the effect of a military laser weapon upon a cloud of mercury droplets. '''Actinic''' was also mentioned in Ambrose Bierce's short story ''[[The Damned Thing (Short Story)]]'' published in 1898. It simply referred to a color that humans cannot see.
*'''Ultra Indigo''' was a color and plot point in an episode of the television series ''[[Eureka (U.S. TV series)|Eureka]]'', possessing the power to decelerate other photons and distort time.
*'''Amarklor''' and '''Kalish''' are colors in the ultraviolet range seen by [[Klingon]]s in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' novel ''[[Pawns and Symbols]]'' by Majliss Larson. In this story, Klingons see amarklor between violet and kalish, but see the color red as black.
*'''[[List of Nebulous episodes#First series|Garrow]]'''&amp;nbsp; and '''Infra-White'''&amp;nbsp; – colors invented in the ''[[Nebulous]]'' episode "Madness Is a Strange Colour". Both colors affect the human mind in odd ways, either destroying or creating sanity. Professor Nebulous claims that he discovered Infra-White by looking ''underneath and behind'' the visible spectrum.
*'''[[Fuligin]]'''&amp;nbsp;– both a color and a textile having that color, associated with the Guild of Torturers in [[Gene Wolfe]]'s book ''[[The Shadow of the Torturer]]''. The color is defined as "the color that is darker than black" and also as "the color of soot". In comparison, see the real colors [[super black]] and [[vantablack]].
*'''[[Grue and bleen]]'''&amp;nbsp;– colors that change after an arbitrary, but fixed time; coined by philosopher Nelson Goodman to illustrate what he calls "the new [[riddle of induction]]."&lt;ref name="Goodman1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nelson Goodman|title=Fact, fiction, and forecast|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i97_LdPXwrAC|accessdate=8 March 2012|year=1983|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-29071-6|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Victor Rousseau Emanuel|Mull and glow]]'''&amp;nbsp;– an infrared and an ultraviolet color seen by futuristic humans in Victor Emmanuel's ''The Messiah of the Cylinder'' (1917).
*'''[[Races and species in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Hooloovoo|Hooloovoo]]'''&amp;nbsp;– a superintelligent shade of the color blue in ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' series by [[Douglas Adams]]. In ''[[Life, the Universe, and Everything]]'', Adams mentions [[Agrajag]]'s lair as being painted in "the whole spectrum of eye-defying colours from Ultra Violent to Infra Dead, taking in Liver Purple, Loathsome Lilac, Matter Yellow, Burnt hombre and Gan Green on the way."&lt;ref&gt;An excerpt by Tom Snyder of [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|H2G2]], located here [http://www.angelfire.com/ca3/tomsnyder/hg-3-18.html].&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Octarine]]'''&amp;nbsp;– the color of magic in the ''[[Discworld]]'' fantasy novels, described as resembling a fluorescent greenish-yellow purple.
*'''[[Squant]]'''&amp;nbsp;– a fourth primary color publicized by the experimental band [[Negativland]] in 1993.
*[[A Voyage to Arcturus#Names|'''Jale''', '''Ulfire''' and '''Dolm''']]&amp;nbsp;– Two new primary colors (Jale and Ulfire) and a compound color of ulfire and blue (dolm) from ''[[A Voyage to Arcturus]]'' (1920) by [[David Lindsay (novelist)|David Lindsay]]. Jale and Ulfire are described as "Just as blue is delicate and mysterious, yellow clear and unsubtle, and red sanguine and passionate, so he felt ulfire to be wild and painful, and jale dreamlike, feverish, and voluptuous."
*The colors [[The Stars My Destination|'''tang''' and '''burn''']] are colors in the [[infrared]] range seen by the [[albino]] [[mutant]] Olivia Presteign (whose [[Visual perception|vision]] only functions in the infrared) in the 1956 [[science fiction]] novel ''[[The Stars My Destination]]'' by [[Alfred Bester]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Boucher|Boucher, Anthony]], Editor ''A Treasury of Great Science Fiction'' Garden City, New York:1959—Doubleday Volume Two—''The Stars My Destination'' by Alfred Bester, Pages 361–522—Color reference Page 465&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Berl''', '''Crynor''', '''Nusp''', and '''Onsible''' are colors from the ''Star Wars'' universe. They are said to be somewhere in the ultraviolet spectrum, which can be seen by [[Hutts]] and [[Kaminoans]] and some others.
*'''Htun''' is a color similar to black only seen by gnomes in the book ''[[Fairest (novel)|Fairest]]'' by [[Gail Carson Levine]].
*'''Sangoire''' is a color of red 'so dark and saturated it [is] almost black', it is also described as 'the color of blood spilled in moonlight', seen in the [[Kushiel's Legacy]] Series by [[Jacqueline Carey]].
*'''Gloxym''' is a fictional color coined by [[Kibology|Kibo]] on his FAQ. He describes Gloxym as the true color of the sky.
*'''Smaudre''' is a color from the fairy world in [[Jack Vance]]'s ''[[Suldrun's Garden]]''. The fairy folk find it lovely, but to the human eye, it appears colorless.
*'''Rawn''' and '''Pallow''' are colors associated with circles of magic beyond white, black, purple and green in Jack Vance's ''Green Magic''.
*'''Plaid''' is one of the colors outside of the natural human spectrum visible to large intelligent [[arachnid]]s in [[Vernor Vinge]]'s novel ''[[A Deepness in the Sky]]''.
*'''Shattan''' is said to be a fourth primary color for Yalia people in ''[[Wonderland Online]]''. It is said to have calming properties and appears to humans as a combination of golden and infraviolet colors.{{citation needed|reason=No mention of Shattan at the linked page.|date=July 2014}}
*'''Flange''' is "every color of the rainbow, all at once" in the book ''[[The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles]]'' by [[Julie Andrews Edwards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-reading.me/bookreader.php/1007836/Edwards_-_The_Last_of_the_Really_Great_Whangdoodles.html|title=Book: The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles|first=Edwards Julie|last=Andrews|date=|website=www.e-reading.me}}&lt;/ref&gt;It is used by the Whangdoodle to impress his bride and it is stated that it is very hard to do. The Whangdoodle is also capable of turning colors such as crash pink, some of which may or may not exist.
*'''Apocyan''', '''Cosmogone''', '''Gant''', '''Irrigo''', '''Peligin''', '''Violant''', and '''Viric''', collectively known as 'the Neathbow', are colors found only in the subterranean Neath of Failbetter Games' ''[[Fallen London]]'' universe. They are impossible shades of existing colours: apocyan is a bright pale aqua, irrigo is brilliant purple, violant has been depicted multiple ways but is usually an iridescent wine-red, cosmogene is golden yellow, gant is beige with a slight reddish tinge, peligin is an extremely dark blue-gray that's almost black, and viric is emerald green. Most of them also have supernatural properties: irrigo causes forgetfulness, violant improves memory, cosmogone and viric are heavily associated with dreams. Gant is the colour that "remains when all other colours are eaten".
*'''El Gris/Gray''' is considered the "third" and an unreal color in ''[[La Historia de los Colores|La Historia de los Colores/The Story of Colors]]'' by [[Subcomandante Marcos]]. It only exists so the black and the white don't bump into each other so hard – it does so by painting the dusks and dawns.
*'''Gloze''' and '''Flush''' are infrared colors mentioned in the book ''[[Neverness]]'' by [[David Zindell]].

==Unnamed fictional colors==
*''[[The Colour Out of Space]]''&amp;nbsp;– a vaguely described alien hue, from the story of that name by [[H. P. Lovecraft]] (1927).
*In ''[[The Golden Key]]'', an 1867 fairy tale by [[George MacDonald]], a boy sees additional colors in a [[rainbow]] in [[Fairy]]land: "He could count all the seven colours, and could see shade after shade beyond the violet; while before the red stood a colour more gorgeous and mysterious still. It was a colour he had never seen before."
*In the [[Mars|Martian]] ([[Barsoom]]) novels of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], the spectrum is divided into nine colors rather than the earthly seven, and the two unearthly colors are called "the eighth ray" and "the ninth ray". [[John Carter of Mars|John Carter]] describes the additional colors as "... two beautiful rays which, to me, were new and nameless. I cannot describe them any more than you could describe red to a blind man. I only know that they were beautiful in the extreme." The eighth ray exerts an anti-gravity force and is trapped in tanks by the Red Martians to levitate and propel their flying craft. The ninth ray is processed by the great atmosphere factory to create breathable air for Barsoom.
*In the 1942 novel ''[[Perelandra]]'', [[C. S. Lewis]] describes the colors of angelic beings when they manifest themselves: "We think that when creatures of the hypersomatic kind choose to 'appear' to us, they are not in fact affecting our retina at all, but directly manipulating the relevant parts of our brain. If so, it is quite possible that they can produce there the sensations we should have if our eyes were capable of receiving those colours in the spectrum which are actually beyond their range." (Chapter 16)
*In [[Stephen King|Stephen King's]] ''[[From a Buick 8]]'', the characters encounter an alien plant with an unearthly color, which the narrator describes as "corpse white".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38718">[[File:GGalantai-mailartwork(c.1989).jpg|right|300px|thumb|Mail art by [[György Galántai]], 1981]]

'''Mail art''' (also known as '''postal art''' and '''correspondence art''') is a populist artistic movement centered on sending small scale works through the [[mail|postal service]].  It initially developed out of what eventually became [[Ray Johnson]]'s New York Correspondence School in the 1950s and the [[Fluxus]] movement in the 1960s, though it has since developed into a global movement that continues to the present.

==Characteristics==

Media commonly used in mail art include postcards, paper, a collage of found or recycled images and objects, rubber stamps, artist-created stamps (called [[artistamps]]), and paint, but can also include music, sound art, poetry, or anything that can be put in an envelope and sent via post.  Mail art is considered art once it is dispatched.  Mail artists regularly call for thematic or topical mail art for use in (often [[unjuried]]) exhibition.&lt;ref name=MOCA /&gt;&lt;ref name=UB&gt;{{cite web|title=Mail Art|url=http://digital.lib.buffalo.edu/cdm/landingpage/collection/LIB-PC001|work=Digital Collections, UB Libraries|publisher=University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mail artists appreciate interconnection with other artists.  The artform promotes an egalitarian way of creating that frequently circumvents official art distribution and approval systems such as the art market, museums, and galleries.  Mail artists rely on their alternative "outsider" network as the primary way of sharing their work, rather than being dependent on the ability to locate and secure exhibition space.&lt;ref name=Oberlin&gt;{{cite web|title=Mail Art @ Oberlin|url=http://www.oberlin.edu/library/art/mailart/|work=Oberlin College Art Library|publisher=Oberlin College &amp; Conservatory|accessdate=11 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403130316/http://www.oberlin.edu/library/art/mailart/|archivedate=3 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KostelanetzBrittain2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Kostelanetz|author2=H. R. Brittain|title=A Dictionary of the Avant-gardes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NZX85xdr6boC|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-93764-1|page=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mail art can be seen as anticipating the cyber communities founded on the Internet.&lt;ref name=Spark /&gt;

==History==

[[File:RayJohnson invite1970.jpg|right|thumb|Ray Johnson's invitation to the first mail art show, 1970]]
Artist Edward M. Plunkett has argued that communication-as-art-form is an ancient tradition; he posits (tongue in cheek) that mail art began when Cleopatra had herself delivered to Julius Caesar in a rolled-up carpet.&lt;ref name=Plunkett&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plunkett|first=Edward M.|title=The New York Correspondence School|journal=Art Journal|year=1977|issue=Spring|url=http://www.artpool.hu/Ray/Publications/Plunkett.html|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ray Johnson, the New York Correspondance School, and Fluxus===
The American artist [[Ray Johnson]] is considered to be the first mail artist.&lt;ref name=MOCA&gt;{{cite web|title=Mail Art|url=http://www.moca.org/pc/viewArtTerm.php?id=22|work=Collection: MOCA's First Thirty Years|publisher=MOCA: The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Phillpot&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillpot|first=Clive|title=Eternal Network: A Mail Art Anthology|year=1995|publisher=University of Calgary Press|location=Canada|url=http://www.artpool.hu/Ray/Publications/Phillpot.html|editor=Chuck Welch|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Johnson's experiments with art in the mail began in 1943, while the posting of instructions and soliciting of activity from his recipients began in the mid-1950s with the mailing of his "moticos", and thus provided mail art with a blueprint for the free exchange of art via post.&lt;ref name=MOCA /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Vincitorio, "Informalista o videoartista? Le tendenze artistiche dagli anni '40 ad oggi", L'Espresso n.44, 7 November 1982{{full citation needed|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "mail art" was coined in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Plunkett /&gt; In 1962, Plunkett coined the term "New York Correspondence School" to refer to Johnson's activities; Johnson adopted this moniker but sometimes intentionally misspelled it as "correspondance."&lt;ref name=Plunkett /&gt; The deliberate misspelling was characteristic of the playful spirit of the Correspondance School and its actions.&lt;ref name=Danto&gt;{{cite journal|last=Danto|first=Arthur C.|journal=The Nation|date=March 29, 1999|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/correspondance-school-art#|title=Correspondance School Art|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Correspondance School members are fairly obscure, and the letters they sent, often featuring simple drawings or stickers, often instructed the recipient to perform some fairly simple action. Johnson's work consists primarily of letters, often with the addition of doodles and rubber stamped messages, which he mailed to friends and acquaintances. The Correspondance School was a network of individuals who were artists by virtue of their willingness to play along and appreciate Johnson's sense of humor.  One example of the activities of the Correspondance School consisted in calling meetings of fan clubs, such as one devoted to the actress [[Anna May Wong]].  Many of Johnson's missives to his network featured a hand drawn version of what became a personal logo or alter-ego, a bunny head.&lt;ref name=Danto /&gt;

In a 1968 interview, Johnson explained that he found mailed correspondence interesting because of the limits it puts on the usual back and forth interaction and negotiation that comprises communication between individuals.  Correspondence is  "a way to convey a message or a kind of idea to someone which is not verbal; it is not a confrontation of two people. It's an object which is opened in privacy, probably, and the message is looked at&amp;nbsp;... You look at the object and, depending on your degree of interest, it very directly gets across to you what is there&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name=AAAOH&gt;{{cite web|title=Oral history interview with Ray Johnson, 1968 Apr. 17|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-ray-johnson-13236|work=Archives of American Art|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Johnson and Marcia Tucker organized The New York Correspondence School Exhibition at the [[Whitney Museum]] in New York, which was the first significant public exhibition of the mail art genre.&lt;ref name=MOCA /&gt;

On April 5, 1973, Johnson declared the "death" of the New York Correspondance School in an unpublished letter to the Obituary Department of ''The New York Times'' and in copies that he circulated to his network.   However, he continued to practice mail art even after this.&lt;ref name=AAALippardLetter&gt;{{cite web|title=Ray Johnson mail art to Lucy R. Lippard, 1965 June 29|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/images/detail/ray-johnson-mail-art-to-lucy-r-lippard-13544|work=Archives of American Art|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RJEstate-bio&gt;{{cite web|title=Ray Johnson Biography|url=http://www.rayjohnsonestate.com/biography/|publisher=Ray Johnson Estate|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although much of Johnson's work was initially given away, this hasn't prevented it from attaining a market value. [[Andy Warhol]] is quoted as saying he would pay ten dollars for anything by Johnson."&lt;ref&gt;Stewart Home, ''The Assault On Culture'', Aporia Press &amp; Unpopular Books, London 1988 {{full citation needed|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1973 diagram showing the development and scope of [[Fluxus]], [[George Maciunas]] included mail art among the activities pursued by the Fluxus artist [[Robert Filliou]].&lt;ref&gt;Hendricks, Jon (1988). ''Fluxus Codex'', New York: Harry N. Abrams, pp 329–333. {{ISBN|978-0-8109-0920-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filliou coined the term the "Eternal Network" that has become synonymous with mail art.&lt;ref name=Bloch&gt;{{cite book|last=Bloch|first=Mark|title=Amazing Letters: The Life and Art of David Zack|url=http://www.panmodern.com/zack-article.html|editor=Istvan Kantor|accessdate=11 April 2013|chapter=An Authentik and Historikal Discourse On the Phenomenon of David Zack, Mail Artist}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other Fluxus artists have been involved since the early 1960s in the creation of artist's postage stamps (Robert Watts, Stamp Dispenser, 1963), postcards (Ben Vautier, The Postman's Choice, 1965: a postcard with a different address on each side) and other works connected to the postal medium.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} "Indeed, the mail art network counts many Fluxus members among its earliest participants.  While Johnson did not consider himself directly as a member of the Fluxus school, his interests and attitudes were consistent with those of a number of Fluxus artists.&lt;ref name=Danto /&gt;&lt;ref name=AAAOH /&gt;

===1970s and 1980s===
In the 1970s, the practice of mail art grew considerably, providing a cheap and flexible channel of expression for cultural outsiders.  It was particularly widespread where state censorship prevented a free circulation of alternative ideas, as in certain countries behind the Iron Curtain or in South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacob|first=John|title=East/West: Mail Art &amp; Censorship|journal=PostHype|year=1985|volume=4|issue=1|issn=0743-6025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of a sizable mail art community, with friendships born out of personal correspondence and, increasingly, mutual visits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lloyd|first=Ginny|title=The Mail Art Community in Europe|journal=Umbrella Magazine|year=1981|volume=5|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; led in the 1980s to the organization of several festivals, meetings and conventions where networkers could meet, socialize, perform, exhibit and plan further collaborations.  Among these events were the Inter Dada Festivals organized in California in the early 1980s&lt;ref name=Ross&gt;{{cite news|last=Ross|first=Janice|title=A gleefully rebellious festival of dada|url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/__IZN7YDU3d4/S_aip9CJ4WI/AAAAAAAAAmU/gS467sN7lZQ/s1600/reibunedada.jpg|accessdate=11 April 2013|newspaper=Oakland Tribune|date=August 26, 1984|location=Art: The Tribune Calendar}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Decentralized Mail Art Congress of 1986.&lt;ref name=HRFrickerOberlin&gt;{{cite web|title=Hans-Reudi Fricker|url=http://www.oberlin.edu/library/art/mailart/bios/fricker.html|work=Mail Art @ Oberlin|publisher=Oberlin College &amp; Conservatory|accessdate=11 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903031741/http://www.oberlin.edu/library/art/mailart/bios/fricker.html|archivedate=3 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 curator Ronny Cohen organized an exhibition for the [[Franklin Furnace]], New York, called "Mail Art Then and Now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mail Art From 1984 Franklin Furnace Exhibition|url=http://www.franklinfurnace.org/research/projects/flow/mailart/mailartf.html|publisher=Franklin Furnace|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition was to have an historical aspect as well as showing new mail art, and to mediate the two aspects Cohen edited the material sent to Franklin Furnace, breaking an unwritten but commonly accepted custom that all works submitted must be shown. The intent to edit, interpreted as censorship, resulted in a two-part panel discussion sponsored by Artists Talk on Art (organized by mail artist Carlo Pittore and moderated by art critic [[Robert C. Morgan]]) in February of that year, where Cohen and the mail artists were to debate the issues.

The night preceding the second panel on February 24, [[Carlo Pittore]], John P. Jacob, Chuck Welch a.k.a. CrackerJack Kid, David Cole and John Held, Jr. crafted a statement asking Dr. Cohen to step down as the panel moderator. Welch delivered the statement whereby Dr. Cohen was asked to remain on the panel but forfeit her right to serve as moderator. Instead of remaining, Cohen chose to leave the event. After some give and take with both panelists and audience, Dr. Cohen left, saying, "Have fun boys." Her entourage walked out with her during the ensuing melee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=International MailArt--Part II: The New Cultural Strategy|last=Heisler|first=Faith|year=1984|issue=4|volume=9|page=18|journal=Women Artists News}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The excluded works were ultimately added to the exhibition by the staff of the Franklin Furnace, but the events surrounding it and the panels revealed ideological rifts within the mail art community. Simultaneously fanning the flames and documenting the extent to which it was already dominated by a small, mostly male, coterie of artists, the discussions were transcribed and published by panelist [[John P. Jacob]] in his short-lived mail art [[zine]] [[PostHype]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacob|first=John|title=Mailart: A Partial Anatomy|journal=PostHype|year=1984|volume=3|issue=1|issn=0743-6025}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to panelist [[Mark Bloch]], [[Ray Johnson]] (who was not a panelist) commented on the reverse-censorship and sexism of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mark|first=Bloch|title=Ray Johnson's letter to me after the event, questioning the issue of sexism.|url=http://www.panmodern.com/ray-atoa-letter.jpg|publisher=panmodern.com|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of mail art meetings and congresses during the late 80s, and the articulation of various "isms" proclaimed by their founders as movements within mail art, were in part a response to fractures made visible by the events surrounding the Franklin Furnace exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacob|first=John|title=The Coffee Table Book of Mail Art: The Intimate Letters of J.P. Jacob, 1981 - 1987|year=1987|publisher=Riding Beggar Press|location=New York|url=http://arcade.nyarc.org:80/record=b569546~S8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if "tourism" was proposed satirically as a new movement by H.R. Fricker, a Swiss mail artist who was one of the organizers of the 1986 Mail Art Congress, nevertheless mail art in its pure form would continue to function without the personal meeting between so-called networkers.&lt;ref name=HRFrickerOberlin /&gt;

In the mid-1980s, Fricker and Bloch, in a bilingual "Open Letter To Everybody in the Network" &lt;ref&gt;Bloch, Mark and Fricker, Hans Ruedi."Phantastische Gebete Revisited" in Panmag International Magazine 6, ISSN 0738-4777, February 1984. pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; stated, "1) An important function of he exhibitions and other group projects in the network is: to open channels to other human beings. 2) After your exhibition is shown and the documentation sent, or after you have received such a documentation with a list of addresses, ''use the channels''! 3) Create person-to-person correspondence... 4) You have your own unique energy which you can give to others through your work: visual audio, verbal, etc.  5) This energy is best used when it is exchanged for energy from another person with the same intentions. 6) the power of the network is in the quality of the direct correspondence, not the quantity." The manifesto concludes, "We have learned this from our own mistakes." &lt;ref&gt;Röder, Kornelia "H. R. Fricker, Mail Art and Social Networks," HR Fricker: Conquer the Living Rooms of the World, Kunstmuseum Thurgau, Warth, Switzerland: Edition Fink, 2014, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s and the impact of the Internet era===
[[File:Paulo bruscky and david horvitz.JPG|thumb|American mail-artist [[David Horvitz]] (active since the 2000s) meets Brazilian mail artist Paulo Bruscky (active since the 1970s) in Berlin, Germany in November 2015.]]

In 1994, Dutch mail artist [[Ruud Janssen]] began a series of [[mail-interviews]] which became an influential contribution in the field of mail art.&lt;ref&gt;
Ruud Janssen, ''Mail-Interviews'', Tilburg 1994–2001
&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1990s, mail art's peak in terms of global postal activities had been reached, and mail artists, aware of increasing postal rates, were beginning the gradual migration of collective art projects towards the web and new, cheaper forms of digital communication.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Bleus]] (Ed.), ''Re: The E-Mail-Art &amp; Internet-Art Manifesto'', in: ''E-Pêle-Mêle: Electronic Mail-Art Netzine'', Vol.III, n° 1, T.A.C.-42.292, Hasselt, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet facilitated faster dissemination of mail art calls (invitations) and precipitated the involvement of a large number of newcomers.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Mail art blogs and websites became ever more frequently used to display contributions and online documentation,{{original research inline|date=January 2013}} even if many{{who|date=January 2013}} mail artists still preferred the surprise of a catalogue found in their mailbox.{{original research inline|date=January 2013}}

==Philosophy and norms of the mail artist network==
In spite of the many links and similarities between historical avant-garde, alternative art practices ([[visual poetry]], [[Xerox art|copy art]], [[artist's book]]s) and mail art, one aspect that distinguishes the creative postal network from other artistic movements, schools or groups (including Fluxus) is the way it disregards and circumvents for the commercial art market.&lt;ref name=Spark&gt;{{cite web|title=About John Held Jr. in the Spark episode "The Fine Art of Collecting"|url=http://www.kqed.org/arts/programs/spark/profile.jsp?essid=4489|work=Spark|publisher=KQED|accessdate=11 April 2013|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Any person with access to a mailbox can participate in the postal network and exchange free artworks, and each mail artist is free to decide how and when to answer (or not answer) a piece of incoming mail. Participants are invited by network members to take part in collective projects or unjuried exhibitions in which entries are not selected or judged.  While contributions may be solicited around a particular theme, work to a required size, or sent in by a deadline, mail art generally operates within a spirit of "anything goes."&lt;ref name="Phillpot" /&gt;

The mail art philosophy of openness and inclusion is exemplified by the "rules" included in invitations (calls) to postal projects: a mail art show has no jury, no entry fee, there is no censorship, and all works are exhibited.&lt;ref name="Phillpot" /&gt; The original contributions are not to be returned and remain the property of the organizers, but a catalogue or documentation is sent free to all the participants in exchange for their works. Although these rules are sometimes stretched, they have generally held up for four decades, with only minor dissimilarities and adjustments, like the occasional requests to avoid works of explicit sexual nature, calls for projects with specific participants, or the recent trend to display digital documentation on blogs and websites instead of personally sending printed paper to contributors.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

[[File:BananaPost'89 AnnaBanana.jpg|right|thumb|BananaPost '89 artistamps by Anna Banana, 1989]]
Mail art has been exhibited in alternative spaces such as private apartments, municipal buildings, and shop windows, as well as in galleries and museums worldwide.&lt;ref name=Oberlin /&gt;   Mail art shows, periodicals, and projects represent the "public" side of postal networking, a practice that has at its core the direct and private interaction between the individual participants. Mail artists value the process of exchanging ideas and the sense of belonging to a global community that is able to maintain a peaceful collaboration beyond differences of language, religion and ideology; this is one aspect that differentiates the mail art network from the world of commercial picture postcards and of simply "mailed art."&lt;ref name="WelchAnthology"&gt;Welch, C. (1995). ''[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/231651233 Eternal network: A mail art anthology]''. Calgary, Alta: Univ. of Calgary Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A mail artist may have hundreds of correspondents from many different countries, or build a smaller core circle of favorite contacts. Mail art is widely practiced in Europe, North and South America, Russia, Australia and Japan, with smaller numbers of participants also in Africa, and China.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}  In addition to being kept by the recipient, mail art archives have attracted the interest of libraries, archives, museums, and private collectors.&lt;ref name=Spark /&gt;  Or, the works may be 'worked into' and recycled back to the sender or to another networker.

Ray Johnson suggested (with a pun) that "mail art has no history, only a present", and mail artists have followed his playful attitude in creating their own mythologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43915838|title=Ray Johnson : correspondences|last=M.|first=De Salvo, Donna|last2=Catherine.|first2=Gudis,|date=1999|publisher=Wexner Center for the Arts|year=|isbn=2080136631|location=|pages=81|oclc=43915838}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parody art movements like [[neoism]] and plagiarism have challenged notions of originality, as have the shared pseudonymous names [[Monty Cantsin]] and [[Karen Eliot]], which were proposed for serial use by anyone.&lt;ref name="Carr2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=C.

Various essays, graduate theses, guides and anthologies of mail art writings have appeared in print and on the Internet, often written by veteran networkers.&lt;ref name=WelchAnthology /&gt;
A sub-group of envelope art has its genesis in the Grateful Dead Ticket Service. Looking to help their fans avoid  the high fees that are generated by national ticket services the Grateful Dead started their own service, commonly referred to as mail order. At some point fans started decorating their envelopes with art. Some for art's sake, others to grab the attention of the people that dole out tickets in hope of better seats.http://www.gdtstoo.com/

==Media and artistic practices in the creation of mail artworks==
{{see also|Postage stamp}}
Because the democratic ethos of mail art is one of inclusion, both in terms of participants ('anyone who can afford the postage') and in the scope of art forms, a broad range of media are employed in creation of mail artworks. Certain materials and techniques are commonly used and frequently favored by mail artists due to their availability, convenience, and ability to produce copies.

===Rubberstamps and artistamps===
[[File:Rubberstamps Klafki Pawson(1980s).jpg|right|thumb|Mail art rubber stamps by Jo Klafki (left) and Mark Pawson (right), 1980s]]
Mail art has adopted and appropriated several of graphic forms already associated with the postal system. The rubber stamp officially used for franking mail, already utilized by [[Dada]] and Fluxus artists, has been embraced by mail artists who, in addition to reusing ready-made rubber stamps, have them professionally made to their own designs. They also carve into erasers with linocut tools to create handmade ones. These unofficial rubber stamps, whether disseminating mail artists' messages or simply announcing the identity of the sender, help to transform regular postcards into artworks and make envelopes an important part of the mail art experience.&lt;ref name=WelchAnthology /&gt;

[[File:CarvedEraser ArtNahpro(c.1990).jpg|right|thumb|Carved eraser print by Paul Jackson, aka Art Nahpro, c. 1990]]
Mail art has also appropriated the postage stamp as a format for individual expression. Inspired by the example of Cinderella stamps and Fluxus faux-stamps, the [[artistamp]] has spawned a vibrant sub-network of artists dedicated to creating and exchanging their own stamps and stamp sheets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpost.be/site/fr/particuliers/timbres-poste/philat%C3%A9lie/timbres/2003/emission-sp%C3%A9ciale-09-du-19-mai |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526171811/http://www.bpost.be/site/fr/particuliers/timbres-poste/philat%C3%A9lie/timbres/2003/emission-sp%C3%A9ciale-09-du-19-mai |archivedate=2015-05-26 |df= }} Belgian Postal Service, Guy Bleus &amp; Jean Spiroux, ''Journée du Timbre: Mail-Art'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Artist [[Jerry Dreva]] of the conceptual art group Les Petits Bonbons created a set of stamps and sent them to David Bowie who then used them as the inspiration for the cover of the single "Ashes to Ashes" released in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Griffin|first1=Roger|title=Scary Monsters|url=http://www.bowiegoldenyears.com/scarymonsters.html|website=Bowie Golden Years}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artistamps and rubber stamps, have become important staples of mail artworks, particularly in the enhancement of postcards and envelopes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Frank, Peter, E.F. Higgins III, Rudolf Ungváry. "[http://www.artpool.hu/Artistamp/PFranke.html Postal Modernism: Artists' Stamps and Stamp Images]." ''World Art Post'', Artpool Archive, Museum of Fine Arts Budapest, April 1982 (pp.&amp;nbsp;1–4)&lt;/ref&gt; The most important anthology of rubberstamp art was published by the artist Hervé Fischer in his book ''Art and Marginal Communication'', Balland, Paris, 1974 - in French, English and German, to note also the catalog of the exhibition "Timbres d'artistes", Published of Musée de la Poste, Paris, 1993, organized by the french artist Jean-Noël Laszlo - in French, English.

===Envelopes===
Some mail artists lavish more attention on the envelopes than the contents within. Painted envelopes are one-of-a-kind artworks with the handwritten address becoming part of the work. Stitching, embossing and an array of drawing materials can all be found on postcards, envelopes and on the contents inside.&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt;

===Printing and copying===
Printing is suited to mail artists who distribute their work widely. Various printmaking techniques, in addition to rubber stamping, are used to create multiples. Copy art (xerography, photocopy) is a common practice, with both mono and color copying being extensively used within the network.&lt;ref name="UB" /&gt;  Ubiquitous 'add &amp; pass' sheets that are designed to be circulated through the network with each artist adding and copying, chain-letter fashion, have also received some unfavorable criticism.{{according to whom|date=January 2013}} However, Xerography has been a key technology in the creation of many short-run periodicals and [[zines]] about mail art, and for the printed documentation that has been the traditional project culmination sent to participants. Inkjet and laserprint computer printouts are also used, both to disseminate artwork and for reproducing zines and documentation, and PDF copies of paperless periodicals and unprinted documentation are circulated by email. Photography is widely used as an art form, to provide images for artistamps and rubber stamps, and within printed and digital magazines and documentation,&lt;ref name="WelchAnthology" /&gt; while some projects have focused on the intersection of mail art with the medium itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacob|first=John|title=[[The International Portfolio of Artists Photography]]|year=1984|publisher=Riding Beggar Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lettering and language===
Lettering, whether handwritten or printed, is integral to mail art. The written word is used as a literary art form, as well as for personal letters and notes sent with artwork and recordings of the spoken word, both of poetry and prose, are also a part of the network.&lt;ref name="UB" /&gt; Although English has been the de facto language, because of the movement's inception in America, an increasing number of mail artists, and mail artist groups on the Internet, now communicate in Breton, French, Italian, German, Spanish, and Russian.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===Other media===
In addition to appropriating the postage stamp model, mail artists have assimilated other design formats for printed artworks. Artists' books, decobooks and [[friendship book]]s, banknotes, stickers, tickets, artist trading cards (ATCs), badges, food packaging, diagrams and maps have all been used.

[[File:Kairan MAZine(2007).jpg|right|thumb|Cover of ''Kairan'' mail art zine, edited by Gianni Simone, aka Johnnyboy, 2007]]
Mail artists routinely mix media; [[collage]] and [[photomontage]] are popular, affording some mail art the stylistic qualities of [[pop art]] or Dada. Mail artists often use collage techniques to produce original postcards, envelopes and work that may be transformed using copy art techniques or computer software, then photocopied or printed out in limited editions.

[[Printed matter]] and [[ephemera]] are often circulated among mail artists, and after artistic treatment, these common items enter into the mail art network.&lt;ref name="UB" /&gt;  Small assemblages, sculptural forms or found objects of irregular shapes and sizes are parceled up or sent unwrapped to deliberately tease and test the efficiency of the postal service. Mailable fake fur ("Hairmail") and [[Astroturf]] postcards were circulated in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="WaPo"&gt;{{cite news |

Having borrowed the notion of [[intermedia]] from Fluxus, mail artists are often active simultaneously in several different fields of expression. Music and [[sound art]] have long been celebrated aspects of mail art, at first using cassette tape, then on CD and as sound files sent via the Internet.&lt;ref name="CoxWarner2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christoph Cox|author2=Daniel Warner|title=Audio Culture: Readings in Modern Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FgDgCOSHPysC&amp;pg=PA60|date=1 September 2004|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-0-8264-1615-5|pages=60–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Performance art]] has also been a prominent facet, particularly since the advent of mail art meetings and congresses. Performances recorded on film or video are communicated via DVD and movie files over the internet. Video is also increasingly being employed to document mail art shows of all kinds.&lt;ref name=mailartforum&gt;{{cite web|title=The Techniques|url=http://www.mail-art.de/frame.php?dir=about:about_techniques&amp;doc=start.htm|work=Mail-Art:The Forum|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotations==

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Correspondence art is an elusive art form, far more variegated by its very nature than, say, painting. Where a painting always involves paint and a support surface, correspondence art can appear as any one of dozens of media transmitted through the mail. While the vast majority of correspondence art or mail art activities take place in the mail, today's new forms of electronic communication blur the edges of that forum. In the 1960s, when correspondence art first began to blossom, most artists found the postal service to be the most readily available - and least expensive - medium of exchange. Today's micro-computers with modern facilities offer anyone computing and communicating power that two decades ago were available only to the largest institutions and corporations, and only a few decades previous weren't available to anyone at any price." - [[Ken Friedman]]&lt;ref name=FriedmanFlue&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedman|first=Ken|title=Mail art history: the Fluxus factor|journal=FLUE - Special Issue: Mail Art|year=1984|volume=4|issue=3–4|editor1-first=Martha|editor1-last=Wilson|publisher=Franklin Furnace}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Cultural exchange is a radical act. It can create paradigms for the reverential sharing and preservation of the earth's water, soil, forests, plants and animals. The ethereal networker aesthetic calls for guiding that dream through action. Cooperation and participation, and the celebration of art as a birthing of life, vision, and spirit are first steps. The artists who meet each other in the Eternal Network have taken these steps. Their shared enterprise is a contribution to our common future." - [[Chuck Welch]]&lt;ref name="WelchAnthology" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The purpose of mail art, an activity shared by many artists throughout the world, is to establish an aesthetical communication between artists and common people in every corner of the globe, to divulge their work outside the structures of the art market and outside the traditional venues and institutions: a free communication in which words and signs, texts and colours act like instruments for a direct and immediate interaction." - Loredana Parmesani&lt;ref&gt;Loredana Parmesani, text under the entry "Poesia visiva", in ''L'arte del secolo - Movimenti, teorie, scuole e tendenze 1900–2000'', Giò Marconi - Skira, Milan 1997 {{full citation needed|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Migrantas''' are an [[artist collective]] based in [[Berlin]], Germany that formed in 2004.&lt;ref name="date-formed" /&gt; The collective focuses on themes such as migration, identity and intercultural communication and designs pictograms together with migrants which are then placed in public spaces in order to give voice to [[Immigration|migrants]] living in [[Germany]].

The collective is made up of migrants and is organised non-hierarchically. Since 2004, the project has been organising exhibitions in various European cities. In 2011, the [[collective]] was awarded the German award for integration and tolerance by the [[German chancellor]], [[Angela Merkel]] on behalf of the Initiative Hauptstadt Berlin.&lt;ref name="Hauptstadt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Graffiti fördern Integration" /&gt;

Migrantas views [[pictograms]] as universally understandable images and a global language.&lt;ref name="global" /&gt; Pictograms designed by Migrantas are similar to those found all over in the world in public spaces where they are normally used in place of written language in advertising and street signs.&lt;ref name="signs" /&gt; The difference between Migrantas' pictograms is that they are used to highlight the individual, cultural, socio-economic and political aspects of migration.&lt;ref name="goethe" /&gt;

The pictograms are developed during [[workshops]] together with migrant groups and associations. The idea is then to make visible the feelings and everyday experiences of migrants, which migrantas argue otherwise receive very little publicity. The collective mostly works with women and encourages workshop participants to express their everyday experiences, feelings and views of life as a migrant living in a foreign culture.&lt;ref name="auswaertigesamt" /&gt; The sketches produced in these workshops are then developed into pictograms by the collective members themselves.

Finally, the pictograms are placed in public spaces during 'urban actions'&lt;ref name="urban" /&gt; which until now have included using posters, billboards, and advertising on public transport. At the same time, migrantas also organises exhibitions of its work and the sketches produced during its workshops. Migrantas argues that this gives the migrants themselves the opportunity to receive public recognition for their own work. At the same time, this provides individuals who have very little access to the media the opportunity to publicise their own experiences of migration and immigration.&lt;ref name="wiedemann" /&gt;

In [[theatre]], a '''monologue''' (from {{lang-el|μονόλογος}}, from μόνος ''mónos'', "alone, solitary" and λόγος ''lógos'', "speech") is a speech presented by a single [[character (arts)|character]], most often to express their mental thoughts aloud, though sometimes also to directly address another character or the [[audience]]. Monologues are common across the range of dramatic media ([[Play (theatre)|play]]s, [[film]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/list/ls000000354/|title=The Greatest Movie Speeches/Monologues of all time!|author=|date=|website=IMDb|accessdate=29 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401000758/http://www.imdb.com/list/ls000000354/|archivedate=1 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.), as well as in non-dramatic media such as [[poetry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/rb/dm1.html |title=Dramatic Monologue: An Introduction |publisher=Victorianweb.org |date=2003-03-10 |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807215608/http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/rb/dm1.html |archivedate=7 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monologues share much in common with several other literary devices including [[Soliloquy|soliloquies]], [[Apostrophe (figure of speech)|apostrophes]], and [[asides|asides]]. There are, however, distinctions between each of these devices.

==Similar literary devices==
Monologues are similar to [[Poetry|poems]], epiphanies, and others, in that, they involve one 'voice' speaking but there are differences between them. For example, a soliloquy involves a character relating his or her thoughts and feelings to him/herself and to the audience without addressing any of the other characters. A monologue is the thoughts of a person spoken out loud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/soliloquy |title=Soliloquy – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706041614/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/soliloquy |archivedate=6 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monologues are also distinct from apostrophes, in which the speaker or writer addresses an imaginary person, inanimate object, or idea.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pleasanton.k12.ca.us/fhsweb/thoeb/RomeoandJuliet.htm |title=The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare |publisher=Pleasanton.k12.ca.us |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902062728/http://www.pleasanton.k12.ca.us/fhsweb/thoeb/RomeoandJuliet.htm |archivedate=2 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asides differ from each of these not only in length (asides are shorter) but also in that asides are not heard by other characters even in situations where they logically should be (e.g. two characters engaging in a [[dialogue]] interrupted by one of them delivering an aside).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==History==
In ancient Greek theatre, the origin of western drama,{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} the conventional three actor rule was preceded by a two actor rule, which was itself preceded by a convention in which only a single actor would appear on stage, along with the chorus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuritz|first=Paul|title=The Making of Theatre History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cS6JV4Z27DoC|accessdate=27 May 2014|year=1988|isbn=978-0-13-547861-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the monologue as a dramatic device, therefore, is not rooted in dialogue. It is, instead, the other way around; dialogue evolved from monologue.

Ancient Roman theatre featured monologues extensively, more commonly than either Ancient Greek theatre or modern theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Link Monologues in Roman Comedy |author=Henry W. Prescott |journal=Classical Philology |volume=34 |issue=1 |date=January 1939 |pages=1–23|jstor=264065}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the key purposes of these monologues was to indicate the passage of significant amounts of time (that would be tedious to actually play out in real time) within scenes. This type of monologue is referred to as a linking monologue.&lt;ref name="jstor1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Link Monologues in Roman Comedy |author=Henry W. Prescott |journal=Classical Philology |volume=34 |issue=2 |date=April 1939 |pages=116–126|jstor=264823}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other monologue types included "entrance monologues"&lt;ref name="jstor1"/&gt; and exit monologues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Exit Monologues in Roman Comedy |author=Henry W. Prescott |journal=Classical Philology|volume=37 |issue=1 |date=January 1942 |pages=1–21 |jstor=264367}}&lt;/ref&gt; In each of these cases a primary function is indicating the passage of time.&lt;ref name="jstor1"/&gt;

From Renaissance theatre onward, monologues generally focused on characters using the extended speech to pursue their dramatic need. Postmodern theatre, on the other hand, often embraces the performative aspects of the monologue, even to the point of challenging the boundary between character portrayal (e.g. acting) and autobiographical speeches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geis|first=Deborah R.|title=Postmodern theatric(k)s: monologue in contemporary American drama|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AiJaAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=27 May 2014|date=December 1993|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|isbn=978-0-472-10467-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Interior monologues involve a character externalizing their thoughts so that the audience can witness experiences that would otherwise be mostly internal. In contrast, a dramatic monologue involves one character speaking to another character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/389899/monologue |title=monologue (drama and literature) - Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812133304/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/389899/monologue |archivedate=12 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monologues can also be divided along the lines of active and narrative monologues. In an active monologue a character is using their speech to achieve a clear goal. Narrative monologues simply involve a character telling a story and can often be identified by the fact that they are in the past tense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/ego/westmontdrama/MonologueInfo.html |title=Monologue Information |publisher=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028033907/http://www.angelfire.com/ego/westmontdrama/MonologueInfo.html |archivedate=28 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Auditions==
Actors in theatre, and sometimes in film and television, may be asked to deliver monologues in auditions. Audition monologues demonstrate an actor's ability to prepare a piece and deliver a performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Audition Monologues|url=http://www.ace-your-audition.com/free-monologues.html|website=Ace Your Audition|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714084548/http://www.ace-your-audition.com/free-monologues.html|archivedate=14 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pieces are usually limited to two minutes or less and are often paired with a contrasting monologue: comic and dramatic; classical and contemporary. The choice of monologues for an audition&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyactor.com/contemporary-monologues/|title=Monologues from Movies &amp; Plays|last=|first=|date=October 4, 2018|website=Daily Actor|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; often depends on the play or role. The audition monologue is a rite of passage with theatre actors.

In aesthetics, '''nimism''' is a particular kind of [[trope (literature)|trope]] or [[symbol]] characterized  by exaggeration.  
The term is derived from [[Latin]] (''nimis''), "too much" and (''nimietas''), ''excess''.  Unlike a [[hyperbole]] or [[paradox]], it is not applied to linguistic or rhetorical phenomena only, but usually refers to other forms of disparity, e.g. disproportions in sculptures and paintings, or certain sorts of discrepancies in appearance or behaviour (in theatre plays, movies etc.).
Thus nimism, by means of symbolic parallels or analogies, is meant to help the reader, viewer etc. to see the truth. A ''negative nimism'' hints at something bad (a weakness, vice, sin, crime etc.), the less frequently used ''positive nimism'' indicates something good (a virtue or something heroic).

==Examples==

*King Duncan’s cloak, too wide for his murderous successor Macbeth. (Shakespeare's ''[[MacBeth]]'')
*The feet of the two naughty  stepsisters, too big (and bloody) to fit Cinderella’s tiny shoe, hence an obvious evidence of their wrong claim. (Brothers Grimm's "[[Cinderella|Cinderella and The Little Glass Slipper]]" )
*Elizabeth Bennet’s look at the nude male sculptures in Darcy’s art gallery, cast much too long to conceal her sexual awakening. (Jane Austen's ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'')
*The proverbial “Qui s’excuse s’accuse” ("[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/qui%20s'excuse%20s'accuse He who excuses himself accuses himself]") referring to an apology offered too early, i.e., untimely and not asked for, and thus revealing a bad conscience.

'''Nocturne painting''' is a term coined by [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] to describe a painting style that depicts scenes evocative of the night or subjects as they appear in a veil of light, in twilight, or in the absence of direct light. In a broader usage, the term has come to refer to any  [[Night in paintings (Western art)|painting of a night scene]],&lt;ref&gt;Lawton, Denis. (1992). ''Education And Politics For The 1990s: Conflict Or Consensus?'' (edition reprint). Psychology Press. p. 150. {{ISBN|0750700793}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or night-piece, such as [[Rembrandt]]'s ''[[The Night Watch (painting)|The Night Watch]]''.

Whistler used the term within the title of his works to represent paintings with a "dreamy, pensive mood" by applying a musical name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dia.org/exhibitions/whistlersite/8.htm |title=Tonalism and the "Nocturne  |publisher=Detroit Institute of Arts |date= |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also titled (and retitled) works using other terms associated with music, such as a "symphony", "harmony", "study" or "arrangement", to emphasize the tonal qualities and the composition and to de-emphasize the narrative content.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Ronald and Anne Koval. (2002). ''James McNeill Whistler: Beyond the Myth.'' De Capo Press. p. 186. {{ISBN|0-786-71032-2}}. (''Note: need to verify this was the edition used.'')&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term "nocturne" can be associated with the [[Tonalism]] movement of the American of the late 19th century and early 20th century which is "characterized by soft, diffused light, muted tones and hazy outlined objects, all of which imbue the works with a strong sense of mood."&lt;ref&gt;[[Joan Marter|Marter, Joan]]. (2011). ''The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art, Volume 1'' Oxford University Press. p. 54. {{ISBN|0195335791}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with winter scenes, nocturnes were a common Tonalist theme.&lt;ref&gt;Conrads, Margaret C.

Hudson Hills. p. 148. {{ISBN|1555950507}}.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Frederic Remington]] used the term as well for his nocturne scenes of the [[American Old West]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/feature/remington/remington08.shtm |title=Artistic experiments |publisher=National Gallery of Art |date= |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/feature/remington/remington09.shtm |title=18 images of Remington’s nocturnes on 18 web pages |publisher=National Gallery of Art |date= |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rembrandt’s nocturnes==
In northern [[Europe]], the [[Dutch Golden Age]] produced one of the greatest artists of all time. The first artist to paint scenes on a regular basis in the nocturne mode was [[Rembrandt van Rijn]] (1606–1669). Many of his portraits were also painted using a nocturne method. As in ''The Mill'' (1645), most of his landscapes were painted to evoke a sense of the nocturne, which could be expressed in either a calm or stormy manner.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/feb/11/art|title=The Enduring Genius of Rembrandt|author=[[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]]|date=11 February 2006|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Remington painted many of his nocturnes in the last years of his life, when he was transitioning from a career as an [[illustrator]] to that of a fine artist and had chosen [[American Impressionism|Impressionism]] as the style in which he worked at the time.

The '''Paseo Arts District''', originally referred to as the Spanish Village,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.newsok.com/olive/apa/oklahoman/SharedView.Article.aspx?href=DOK/1980/05/22&amp;id=Ar01000&amp;sk=1BFB1BEE|title=Weekend Paseo Festival|last=|first=|date=5/22/1980|website=The Daily Oklahoman|archive-url=http://archive.newsok.com/olive/apa/oklahoman/SharedView.Article.aspx?href=DOK%2F1980%2F05%2F22&amp;id=Ar01000&amp;sk=1BFB1BEE|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; was built in 1929 as the first commercial shopping district north of [[Downtown Oklahoma City]] by Oklahoman G.A. Nichols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Paseo|work=thepaseo.com|url=http://thepaseo.com/aboutus.html|accessdate=9/11/2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806192350/http://www.thepaseo.com/aboutus.html#|archive-date=2011-08-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early business in the area included a swimming pool called the Paseo Plunge,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.newsok.com/olive/apa/oklahoman/SharedView.Article.aspx?href=DOK/1951/05/30&amp;id=Ar01103&amp;sk=62432EED|title=Swim!|last=|first=|date=5/30/1951|website=The Daily Oklahoman|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; a dry cleaner, drug store,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.newsok.com/olive/apa/oklahoman/SharedView.Article.aspx?href=DOK/1939/02/20&amp;id=Ar00703&amp;sk=CCBF7BC4|title=Drugstore Thieves Work Under Lights|last=|first=|date=2/20/1939|website=The Daily Oklahoman|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; shoe repair store,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.newsok.com/olive/apa/oklahoman/SharedView.Article.aspx?href=DOK/1933/03/31&amp;id=Ar00702&amp;sk=0928A1F4|title=Pippin's Paseo Shoe Rebuilders|last=|first=|date=3/31/1933|website=|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and restaurants. The Spanish Village era is said to have ended in the mid-1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.newsok.com/olive/apa/oklahoman/SharedView.Article.aspx?href=DOK/1983/05/27&amp;id=Ar14500&amp;sk=65DC8D13|title=Paseo wiping out its hippy-era|last=|first=|date=5/27/1983|website=|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paseo has undergone transformations; currently, the Paseo is enjoying a renaissance since the 1980s. Today, a vibrant group of artists and other interested people are transforming this community through creative thinking and arts activities.

Located along Paseo Drive at roughly N. Walker Ave and NW 28th Street, the faux Spanish village with its stucco buildings and clay tile roofs is the home to many of [[Oklahoma City]]'s Artists.

The Paseo Arts district is home to a number of chic bars, restaurants, boutiques, nightclubs, art galleries, and avant-garde businesses. Since 1975, Paseo hosts the annual Paseo Arts Festival each [[Memorial Day]] weekend, which showcases original works of visual and performing arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.newsok.com/olive/apa/oklahoman/SharedView.Article.aspx?href=DOK/1984/05/23&amp;id=Ar06900&amp;sk=C9D602AC|title=Paseo Festival's Foothold Solid After Nine Years|last=|first=|date=5/23/1984|website=The Daily Oklahoman|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other events within the Paseo Arts district include its annual Fairy Ball, as well as the First Friday Gallery Walk. The First Friday Gallery Walk  is an event in which Paseo art galleries and restaurants host Art Opening Receptions on the first Friday of every month in order to displaying new artist's work and invite people to visit the Paseo district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Friday|work=thepaseo.com/calendar/firstfriday.html|accessdate=9/11/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The district is also home to the oldest church in Oklahoma, Old Trinity of Paseo.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oldtrinityofpaseo.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The former Anglican church was built in [[New Brunswick]], [[Canada]] in 1842 and was closed in 1990. Oklahoma City photographer Tom Lee purchased the church in 2000 and had it dismantled and moved to Oklahoma City to serve as his studio. Lee sold the church in 2007 to be rented as a venue for weddings and other events.&lt;ref&gt;http://okc.net/2011/01/31/keeping-okc-weird-a-rough-guide-to-the-paseo/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Paseo district is listed as a neighborhood ‘worthy of preservation’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Register of Historic Places|work=nps.gov/nr/}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Oklahoma County, Oklahoma|National Register of Historic Places]] and in 2010, was named as one of the ’10 Great Neighborhoods for 2010’ by the American Planning Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NewsOK Article|work=newsok.com |url=http://newsok.com/okcs-paseo-named-as-one-of-americas-10-great-neighborhoods-for-2010/article/3504008|accessdate=9/11/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the galleries in the district is JRB Art at the Elms Gallery, housed in the former home of painter and museum director [[Nan Sheets]].&lt;ref name="ionok.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ionok.com/culture/arts/nan-sheets-artist-scrapbook/|title=Nan Sheets: Artist Scrapbook|publisher=|accessdate=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Physical art''', as contrasted with [[conceptual art]], refers to art that [[concrete]]ly exists in physical [[reality]], in [[space]] and [[time]].  Its [[ontology|ontological]] status is that it is a [[physical object]].  The art is [[concrete]]ly realized but may be [[abstract art|abstract]] in nature.  For example, a painting, sculpture, or performance exists in the physical world.  This is contrasted to [[conceptual art]], some but not all kinds of [[performance art]], [[Aesthetics|computer software]], or objects of [[mathematical beauty]], such as a [[mathematical proof]], which do not exist in the [[mental world]] or in [[physical world]], but have other ontological status, such as in [[Plato]]'s world of [[Platonic ideal|ideals]].  Here, the art, may be ''realized'' in the physical world, such as a [[mathematical proof]] written on a chalkboard, but refer to objects that [[existence|exists]] in the [[mind]] as [[concept]]s, not physical objects.  A [[music]] performance is physical, while the composition, like computer software, is not.&lt;ref name=Leo2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Betancourt|first=Michael|title=A Taxonomy of Abstract Form Using Studies of Synesthesia and Hallucinations|journal=Leonardo|date=February 2007|volume=40|issue=1|pages=59–65|doi=10.1162/leon.2007.40.1.59|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/leon.2007.40.1.59|accessdate=27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gnidebillede Genstande 0263.jpg|thumb|Rubbing of Icelandic woodcuts]]
A '''rubbing''' (''[[Frottage (art)|frottage]]'') is a reproduction of the [[Surface finish|texture]] of a surface created by placing a piece of paper or similar material over the subject and then rubbing the paper with something to deposit marks, most commonly [[charcoal]] or [[pencil]], but also various forms of blotted and rolled ink, [[chalk]], [[wax]], and many other substances. For all its simplicity, the  technique can be used to produce blur-free images of minuscule elevations and depressions on areas of any size in a way that can hardly be matched by even the most elaborate, state-of-the-art methods. In this way, surface elevations measuring only a few thousandths of a millimeter can be made visible.&lt;ref&gt;Lukowsky, D., ''Failure Analysis of Wood and Wood-Based Products'', McGraw-Hill Education; 1st edition (2015) {{ISBN|978-0-07-183937-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Common uses for this technique include:
* [[Brass rubbing]], to make copies of [[monumental brass]]es
* [[Forensic]] uses, including finding out what was written on a sheet of paper removed from a pad by rubbing the impressions left on subsequent sheets or other backing materials
* [[Frottage (art)|Frottage]], a [[surrealist]] art form
* [[Stone rubbing]], to make copies of patterns and inscriptions of gravestones or other incised or textured stone surfaces

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Samikshavad.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''Politicians of Today'' by Ram Chandra Shukla]] --&gt;'''Samikshavad''' is the first indigenous [[art movement]] in modern [[India]], which started in [[North India]] in 1974. It has a different identity from the western movements of art. It is neither affected nor inspired by western art.

Its main source of inspiration is the present social, political, cultural and economic conditions. Its aim is to make the art free from personalized obligations and to socialize it, to change the art from mystery to something having special aim. By this style, the artist tends to expose the corruption prevalent in society and politics, with a language that is symbolic and satirical. This movement has changed the scenario of modern Indian painting in India in the late '70s. A few of the artists who were inspired by this movement were Ravindra Nath Mishra, Hridya Narayan Mishra, Santosh Kumar Singh, Virendra Prasad Singh, Ram Shabd Singh, Raghuvir Sen Dhir, Ved Prakash Mishra, Gopal Madhukar Chaturvedi, Bala Dutt Pandey etc. Prof. [[Ram Chandra Shukla]], Professor and Head of the Department of Painting at [[Banaras Hindu University]], [[Varanasi]], at that time, was the initiator and the main source of inspiration for this movement.

Samikshavad is an Indian movement of Modern Art which is opposed to the tendency of Indian artists following the Western trends of Modern Art. Its basic purpose is to help create such an art in the country which has its roots in Indian soil. "Samiksha" is a Sanskrit word which means criticism of life and society in which they live. It is also against any type of imitation of the past styles or the present styles of art. A manifesto of the movement was published at the first exhibition of such paintings at the [[AIFACS]] Gallery in 1979 at Delhi. The exhibition presented in all, 26 paintings in oil medium. The artists whose works were included in the first exhibition were S/s R.C. Shukla, R.S. Dhir, Santosh Kumar Singh and Ved Prakash Mishra from Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi; Dr. Gopal Madhukar Chaturvedi from Aligarh and Bala Dutt Pandey from Allahabad. The exhibition was inaugurated by the well-known "young Turk" Shri Chandra Shekhar, then President of the [[Janata Party]]. Since then lots of comments, reviews and articles have come from several of the leading newspapers, weeklies and art journals referring to this movement. Invitations have been received from several parts of India to hold exhibitions there. There is a silent but meaningful whisper in the air about "Samikshavad" in Indian art circles. Several illustrated lecture programs on Samikshavad have been sponsored by university art departments at different places. The movement has gained ground in the country and has created a new atmosphere in the field of art for an indigenous development of Indian Modern Art. The only hurdle in the way of Indian art is prejudice, ''purvagrah'' (bias) and misconception. Samikshavad is a modern movement of Indian contemporary art.

The exhibition at Delhi was visited by thousands of people{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} including well-known artists, art critics, art connoisseurs, journalists and the common people.

Modern Western art is either an expression of the artists' inner turmoil and tensions or mere feats of colour and form. Mostly it is aimless or personal fad. Can such art ever become popular and useful to society at large? But capitalist society has accepted it as a form of business transactions. They collect art and sell art just to make capital out of it. In a poor country like India art cannot fulfill that aim. Art can have no other aim but to serve the people, to inspire and educate them, to prepare them for a better life and society. And "Samikshavad" aims at that.

"Samikshavadi" artists are not at all interested in merely showing feats of colour and form. Colour and form or their composition, in itself that of abstract art, may produce a musical or magical effect, but art cannot survive or thrive on that alone. Such music or magic, if they just remain to be a form of entertainment and do not serve a higher purpose of social uplift, cannot claim to be great art. They may remain in the category of crafts. But those crafts which are not useful like "witch-craft" have no place in modern society. Today the so-called Modern Artists who are better than such craftsmen, when called upon to explain the purpose of their art, prattle, "We create 'Form', 'Colour composition' or 'Symbol'". They go no further and expect the visitor to appreciate and explain their jargon themselves. Line, form, colour, texture or tones are just elements of the language of art. They cannot be an end in themselves. They have to be used skilfully to serve the purpose of communication or expression. If they fail in this they are just like heaps of useless bricks, sand and cement gathered together. They cannot claim to be purposeful if they do not help in creating a building suitable for human living. "Samikshavadi" painters are not interested in showing their excellence of skill or painterly qualities as an end in itself.

They believe in using simple, direct and powerful language of art to express their ideas and feelings forcefully as witnessed in the folk arts. Painterly qualities or the fineries of art are the fads of a capitalist or feudalistic society; they are not at all needed in the socialistic society.
Samikshavadi painters use a symbolic language. They express their ideas and feelings through common and powerful symbols. It is because of this that sometimes they are mistaken for Surrealists, which they certainly are not. Surrealists are also supposed to use dream symbols influenced by Freud's dream psychology, and they claimed it to be "pure psychic automatism through which it is intended to express the true functioning of thought. Thought dictated in the absence of all control exerted by reason", whereas Samikshavadis use common symbols consciously and rationally to express their desired idea. Surrealist works are mystic and fantastic in nature but a Samikshavadi artist is socially motivated; a Surrealist attitude is highly personal and individual whereas a Samikshavadi attitude is generally impersonal. Surrealism is basically an anti-art movement but Samikshavadi is an art movement suited to the present atmosphere in the country.

It is generally satirical in nature. The element of satire is its specialty. Up till now the element of satire was generally considered to be a feature of cartoons or caricatures.  Never before in the history of Indian art was satire used as an important medium of art expression in the form of painting, as seen in Samikshavadi art. Perhaps satire was not considered to be necessary or advisable in painting because ancient and medieval art was mostly religious, mythological and idealistic. Under the present circumstances and social change art cannot remain only religious. It has tended towards secularism. The Samikshavadi painters are motivated by day-to-day happenings and are sensitive to the political and social conditions in which they live today. The social, political and economic problems of India are depressing. Life is becoming insecure and helpless. Poverty has multiplied. Exploitation is at its height. Under such circumstances artists and writers have to play an important role. They cannot just remain in a dreamland. They have to educate their people and awaken them to be prepared to fight the evils of the society. Satire is a powerful media to bring to bring people back to senses. Satire can give a shock treatment to generate a new energy in the people to face the real problems, to transform the society. Samikshavad aims at that and that is why it has taken a new course which was not commonly used in the field of painting up till now. Their path may appear to the prejudiced person aesthetically unsound but it is socially very promising.

It is true that Samikshavadi painters are against imagination of any of the past styles or isms of art of the East or the West, but sometimes their work may indicate some influences. This may either be consciously done or just due to past habit, and may disappear after some time. But whatever influences are seen they are generally of a technical nature. Samikshavadi painters are free to choose any technique that serves them in expressing their ideas and feelings powerfully. Some of the Samikshavadis are interested in using techniques of the past Indian Art to become more meaningful and effective. This does not mean that they are tied to any traditional style. Technique and style or "isms" are not the same thing.

The themes of Samikshavadi paintings are taken from social life of the common people. It is not something new. Many artists have done so in the past and are still doing so. In India [[Amrita Shergil]] was the first important and powerful painter of social life. Satish Gujral in his early phase also painted social life powerfully. Others have also done it. But there is a difference of approach between them and Samikshavadi painters. Most of the artists have been interested in their day-to-day social life. That also is no doubt important and useful in bringing about social change but Samikshavadi painters are not contented with that only. They have gone a step further. They may show the plight of the people also but they are much more interested in attacking those who are responsible for it. If the causes are exposed the people will be more alert to eradicate them. Their description of the malady suggests lines of treatment. Moreover, Samikshavadi painters are generally interested in conscious symbolic sarcasm which is definitely a new phenomenon in the field of painting. This attitude has been witnessed casually in some form or the other in some of the artists' work in India and abroad, but never before it has come out as a combined movement with this particular purpose. Mostly other painters have been just satisfied in mocking the contemporary life pattern as did the pop artist of the west, which has been nothing but an anti-art attitude, or the Surrealists' like that of Chagall and Richard Hamilton. Bhupen Khokhor of India has followed the same attitude of the pop artist of the West.

[[File:Screen tone example.svg|thumb|Three shapes overlaid with different screentone patterns]]
'''Screentone''' is a technique for applying [[Texture (computer graphics)|texture]]s and [[shading|shade]]s to [[drawing]]s, used as an alternative to [[hatching]]. In the conventional process, patterns are transferred to [[paper]] from preprinted sheets,&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Kinsella, ''Adult Manga: Culture and Power in Contemporary Japanese Society'', Routledge, 2000, p59. {{ISBN|0-7007-1003-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the technique is also simulated in [[computer graphics]].  It is also known by the common brand names Zip-A-Tone (1937, now defunct&lt;ref&gt;Manufacturer-supplied first use date for {{US trademark|71456830 |Zip-A-Tone}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Chart-Pak (1949&lt;ref&gt;Manufacturer-supplied first use date for {{US trademark|72055435|Chart-Pak}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and Letratone (1966, from [[Letraset]]&lt;ref&gt;Manufacturer-supplied first use date for {{US trademark|72322600|Letratone}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

A traditional screentone sheet consists of a flexible transparent backing, the printed texture, and a [[wax]] [[adhesive]] layer. The sheet is applied to the paper, adhesive down, and rubbed with a stylus on the backing side. The backing is then peeled off, leaving the [[ink]] adhered to the paper where pressure was applied.

 | image2 = Lovelorn54pp25.png  
 | alt2 = 
 | footer = Screentone was frequently used in 1950s American [[Comic book|comics]].
}}
A screentone saves an artist's time by allowing quick application of textures to [[line art]] where a hand-shaded area would not be reproduced in a timely or acceptable manner. Much like [[halftone]], the size and spacing of black dots, lines, or hatches determine how light or dark an area will appear. Visual artists need to take into account how much an image will be reduced when prepared for publication when choosing the [[Dot pitch|pitch]] of a screentone. Screentones can also be layered to produce [[interference pattern]]s such as [[moire effect]]s, or to simulate multiple sources of shadow in an image.

==Styles==
Different styles of screentone exist, variously intended to depict clothing, clouds, emotions, backgrounds, [[image gradient|gradients]] and even objects such as trees. While the sheets are most commonly produced with black ink, there are also varieties in solid and patterned colors. Screentones can also be modified by lightly scratching the backing with an [[X-Acto]] blade to produce [[Starburst (symbol)|starburst]]s and other special effects.
[[File:Manga screentone.svg|thumb|Manga screentone]]
Screentones are widely used by illustrators and artists, especially for [[cartoon]]s and [[advertising]]. Use of the original medium has been declining since the advent of [[graphics software]] and [[desktop publishing]], but it is still used, for example in [[manga]].

While computer graphics software provides a variety of alternatives to screentone, its appearance is still frequently simulated, to achieve consistency with earlier work or avoid the appearance of computer-generated images. It is sometimes accomplished by [[image scanner|scanning]] actual screentone sheets, but original vector or bitmap screen patterns are also used.

'''Sophistication''' has come to mean a few things, but its original definition was "to denature, or simplify". Today it is common as a measure of refinement—displaying [[Taste (sociology)|good taste]], [[wisdom]] and subtlety rather than crudeness, [[stupidity]] and [[vulgarity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OjwEQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=intitle:Sophistication |title=Sophistication: A Literary and Cultural History |author=Faye Hammill|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the perception of [[social class]], sophistication can be linked with concepts such as [[social status|status]], [[privilege (social inequality)|privilege]] and [[Superior (hierarchy)|superior]]ity.&lt;ref&gt;

== Scope of sophistication ==
{{Expand section|date=March 2011}}
In social terms, the connotations of sophistication depends on whether one is an insider or an outsider of the sophisticated class.  Sophistication can be seen as "a form of snobbery," or as "among the most desirable of human qualities."&lt;ref&gt;

A study of style conveys an idea of the range of possible elements through which one can demonstrate sophistication in [[elegance]] and [[fashion]], covering the art of "[...] the shoemaker, the hairdresser, the cosmetologist, the cookbook writers, the chef, the diamond merchant, the couturieres, and the fashion queens, the inventors of the folding umbrella ... and of champagne."&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
{{Expand section|date=March 2011}}
In [[Ancient Greece]], ''sophia'' was the special [[insight]] of [[poet]]s and [[prophet]]s.  This then became the wisdom of [[philosophers]] such as [[sophists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Sophistication |author=Mark Backman |chapter=The Roots of Our Sophistication |isbn=978-0-918024-91-6 |publisher=Ox Bow Press |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But their use of [[rhetoric]] to win arguments gave sophistication a derogatory quality. Sophistry was then the art of misleading.

The system of modern Western sophistication has its roots in France, arguably helped along its way by the policies of King [[Louis XIV]] (reigned 1643–1715).&lt;ref&gt;
For example: {{cite book
| last       = DeJean
| first      = Joan
| title         = The essence of style: how the French invented high fashion, fine food, chic cafes, style, sophistication, and glamour
| year      = 2003
| publisher = Free Press
| location  = New York
| isbn      = 978-0-7432-6413-6
| page      = 3
| quote         = In the sixteenth century, the French were not thought of as the most elegant or the most sophisticated European nation. By the early eighteenth century, however, people all over Europe declared that 'the French are stylish' or 'the French know good food,' just as they said, 'the Dutch are clean.' France had acquired a sort of monopoly on culture, style, and luxury living, a position that it has occupied ever since. [...] Beginning in the late seventeenth century, travelers were saying what novelists and filmmakers are still repeating: travel to Paris was guaranteed to add a touch of magic to every life. [...] [F]rom this moment on, that touch of magic became widely desired: elegance, luxury, and sophistication became factors to be reckoned with.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The English regarded sophistication as decadent and deceptive until the aristocratic [[sensibility|sensibilities]] and refined elegance of Regency [[dandy|dandies]] such as [[Beau Brummell]] (1778–1840) became fashionable and admired.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=413279&amp;sectioncode=26 |journal=[[Times Higher Education]] |author=Deborah Longworth |date=2 Sep 2010 |title=Sophistication: A Literary and Cultural History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of sophistication ==

Recognised varieties of sophistication include:

* cultural sophistication&lt;ref&gt;
For example:

| pages      = 91–92
| quote         = The pursuit of cultural sophistication (Bourdieu's cultural capital) was until recently a niche phenomenon in America. It existed mainly in 'old-money' families, which dominated elite breeding grounds (prep schools, Ivy league universities, elite liberal arts colleges), and in the small Bohemian circles in the country's biggest cities. [...] The transformation of the American class dynamic from a single-minded striving for economic abundance to a multi-dimensional striving for sophistication in addition to abundance – a mixture of status pursuits more typical of Europe – was seeded in the 1960s.                   = adam markovich
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;(or culturedness)
* intellectual sophistication&lt;ref&gt;
For example:{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

In the analysis of [[humor]], [[Victor Raskin]] distinguishes "two types of sophistication: limited access, or allusive knowledge, and complex processing".&lt;ref&gt;

== Acquiring sophistication ==

Methods of acquiring the appearance of personal sophistication include:

* educational travel – note the function of the traditional [[Grand Tour]] for European aesthetes&lt;ref&gt;

The '''South Main Arts District''' in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] makes up the southern portion of [[Downtown Memphis, Tennessee|Downtown Memphis]]. It is located along South Main Street.

==Attractions==

===Points of historical interest===
Two great points of historical interest in Memphis reside in this area. One is the [[National Civil Rights Museum]]. The other is the historic restaurant the Arcade, located on the south corner of South Main and G.E. Patterson. It is the oldest coffee shop and one of the oldest family owned restaurants in Memphis. Elvis used to hang out at the Arcade&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/aug/03/usa.newyork The Guardian - Top 10 rock'n'roll landmarks in the US]&lt;/ref&gt; and it has become a favorite among filmmakers; several movies have had scenes filmed at the diner-styled restaurant.

===Art Trolley Tour===
On the last Friday of each month, an event called "Trolley Night" is put on by the South Main Association, as well as owners of the South Main businesses and art galleries. From 6-9pm, this includes free [[Memphis Area Transit Authority|MATA]] trolley service up and down Main Street, open art galleries, and longer hours for most area shops and restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southmainmemphis.net/trolley-nights Art Trolley Tour Information]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Locations and Buildings===
Several notable locations and buildings are located in the South Main district.
* [[National Civil Rights Museum]]
* [[Central Station (Memphis)|Central Station]]
* [http://www.arcaderestaurant.com The Arcade Restaurant]
* [http://www.earnestineandhazels.com Earnestine &amp; Hazel's]

==Films==
The South Main district has been featured in many films, sometimes as just background scenery in Memphis, sometimes masquerading as an older version of [[Beale Street]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southmainmemphis.net/about South Main Official Site - About Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the films featuring scenes from the South Main district are:
* ''[[The Firm (1993 film)|The Firm]]'' — Tom Cruise and the FBI meet at The Arcade Restaurant.
* ''[[21 Grams]]''
* ''[[Hustle &amp; Flow]]''
* ''[[Walk the Line]]'' — The scenes shown on "Beale Street" are actually South Main, somewhat dressed up and slightly CGI enhanced.
* ''[[Black Snake Moan (film)|Black Snake Moan]]'' — While most of the movie was shot in the Pyramid, several scenes were shot on South Main as well.
* ''[[My Blueberry Nights]]'' — Filmed inside Ernestine and Hazel's and the Arcade Restaurant, as well as several exterior shots along South Main and G.E. Patterson.
* ''[[Nothing but the Truth (2008 American film)|Nothing But the Truth]]'' — Scenes were shot at the Arcade Restaurant (which is transformed via green screen special effects into a Washington eatery).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''The Art Genome Project''' is the search technology behind [[Artsy (website)|Artsy]].

The Art Genome Project's search technology is the product of an ongoing art-historical study—undertaken by a team of contributors with art-historical backgrounds at Artsy—seeking to define the characteristics which distinguish and connect works of art, architecture, ancient artifacts and design.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Its primary aim is to provide Artsy users dynamic search categories and explain similarities among art and artists. Currently, there are 1000+ "[[genes]]" (i.e. attributes of art) in the project’s taxonomy, including art-historical movements, subject matter, and formal qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museumgeek.wordpress.com/2012/09/21/interview-matthew-israel-on-the-art-genome-project/|title=Interview: Matthew Israel on The Art Genome Project|work=museum geek}}&lt;/ref&gt; These genes are the product of Artsy’s team and their engagement with (and feedback from) the museums, galleries, curators, critics and art historians present on Artsy’s platform.

There are two general parts of the project: 1) Conceiving and defining such characteristics, referred to as "[[gene]]s," and 2) Applying these genes to artists and artworks—creating "[[genome]]s" for both—for the artsy.net site.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Importantly, unlike tags, which are binary, genes are applied with values ranging from 0 to 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/11/mf_artsy/all/1|title=Art.sy's 'Genome' Predicts What Paintings You Will Like - WIRED|work=WIRED}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seminarstogo.wordpress.com/2012/10/14/the-art-genome-project/|title=The Art Genome Project|work=Seminars To Go}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value indicates the degree of relevance of a gene to an artist or work of art. While not seen by users, such gene values account for the strength of a relationship between artists and artworks. It also enables similarity to be expressed in a more nuanced way&lt;{{cn|date=March 2018}} than it might be with just tags because one can weigh various attributes of an artist or work of art to establish which might be the most or less important. Furthermore, such nuance allows for matching potential collectors with artworks based on their tastes and preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/11/mf_artsy/all/1|title=Art.sy's 'Genome' Predicts What Paintings You Will Like - WIRED|work=WIRED}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Anita. "Works for Me: A Recommendation Engine Takes On Fine Art." Time Magazine (June 4, 2012), 56-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Artsy’s "genes" create various opportunities for discovering and learning about the artist and artworks. If users search for an artist, they can see "related" artists and if they search for an artwork, they can see "related" artworks. Genes (with definitions) also appear on their own pages and provide the backbone for Artsy’s Browse page.

The Art Genome Project provides [[metadata]] for search (and similarity) results based on the principles of [[information retrieval]] (TF/IDF) and presents results in a [[User experience design|UX]]-driven search product.

Matthew Israel, an art historian, is the Director of The Art Genome Project.&lt;ref&gt;http://matthewisraelprojects.tumblr.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Precedents for The Art Genome Project ==

The Art Genome Project has often been compared to [[Pandora Radio|Pandora's]] [[Music Genome Project]], and was originally developed in consultation with Pandora’s Joe Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/09/artsy-launch/|title=Two Years In Coming, Art.sy Finally Brings Pandora’s Genome Project To The Wacky World Of Art|publisher=AOL|work=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/arts/design/artsy-is-mapping-the-world-of-art-on-the-web.html?pagewanted=1&lt;/ref&gt; Both aim to create comprehensive (though by no means exhaustive) analyses of types of art by identifying a set of criteria, which both call "genes". These are both broadly applicable to their respective art forms, as well as useful for generating interesting connections for users. Importantly, while The Art Genome is currently one extensive list of genes for all works of art, Pandora has separate genomes (lists of genes) for each genre of music.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

The Music Genome Project and TAGP are examples of [[Big Data]], which is a sector of [[algorithm]]ic technology that synthesizes data to predict what users will prefer. Artsy’s genome is user facing, allowing users to navigate genes manually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.domusweb.it/en/design/2013/04/22/retooling_history.html|title=Retooling history|work=domusweb.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Netflix]] also makes customized recommendations to users based on the qualities of the movies that they enjoy. [[Amazon (website)|Amazon Art]] makes suggestions to users based on their browsing and purchasing history.

Museums and galleries as well as other online art image databases, such as [[Google Art Project]] and [[Artstor]], digitize artworks for public access, but beyond providing basic metadata (artist, title, date, medium) these databases do not extensively classify works of art or create connections between them.

== The Art Genome Project and Other Taxonomies for Artwork ==

Art historians, libraries and image archives have long used classification systems, art cataloging standards or metadata, and created taxonomies, such as The Getty Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/|title=Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus (Getty Research Institute)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to systematize the description of artworks. Classification is one of the major foundations of the discipline of art history.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Most college and university art history surveys are based on such an idea of classification, to provide students with a way of grasping the history of art and a jumping-off point for more focused research. Unlike other types of classification, The Art Genome's taxonomy was designed for the purposes of establishing similarities between artists and artworks.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

=== Genes versus Tags ===

In the words of Matthew Israel, Director of The Art Genome Project, "Genes are not tags — though we have many tags on the site — because tags are binary (something is either tagged "dog" or not). Genes, in contrast, can range from 0-100, thus capturing how strongly a gene applies to a specific artist or artwork. This nuanced connection between works of art is impossible with a simple tagging mechanism."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.quora.com/What-is-The-Art-Genome-Project&lt;/ref&gt;

Importantly, The Art Genome Project does incorporate over 6000 tags for content (iconography) in artwork as well as certain materials and mediums, which do not need the nuance of genes.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

== Reception ==

=== Positive Reception ===
Digtalmeetsculture.net calls TAGP "user-friendly," "intelligent and orchestrated behind the scenes by the Artsy experts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalmeetsculture.net/article/artsy-all-the-world%E2%80%99s-art-freely-accessible/|title=ARTSY, all the world’s art freely accessible|work=Digital meets Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complex.com highlighted genes in their article "15 Awesome Genes on Artsy"  to show "just how incredible their project is."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/art-design/2012/11/15-awesome-genes-on-artsy/|title=15 Awesome Genes on Artsy|author=Cedar Pasori|work=Complex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the New York Times, the [[Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum|Cooper-Hewitt]] Museum’s director of new and emerging media Seb Chan said, "sites like Art.sy were not meant to replace museums, galleries or books, but rather to help the public, especially art neophytes, stretch the boundaries of their taste. ‘You shouldn’t need to be a scholar to discover works of art that you might be fascinated by,’ he said. ‘You go to museums and you browse — chancing upon things is what it’s all about. The Art Genome is another way of creating serendipitous connections.’"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/arts/design/artsy-is-mapping-the-world-of-art-on-the-web.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonathan Olivares praised The Art Genome’s comprehensiveness, objectivity and ability to accommodate future revisions: "Unlike books, which can only be modified between editions, the website is made of millions of layers of edits that can be reworked at any time… [and] [u]nlike the opinionated and subjectively ordered history book, this neutral and re-configurable database will allow us to access any work of art or design, within any imaginable order, and instantly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.domusweb.it/en/design/2013/04/22/retooling_history.html|title=Retooling history|work=domusweb.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
Criticism around The Art Genome Project centers on "its classification system, which rubs some artists the wrong way."&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Anita. "Works for Me: A Recommendation Engine Takes On Fine Art." Time Magazine (June 4, 2012), 56-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics have questioned the accuracy of the connections made through genes: "'I don't think what I am doing has anything to do with [[Cindy Sherman]],' says British artist Jonathan Smith after being told the site links his work to hers via a staged-photography gene. 'That sounds like something a programmer would think of."&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Anita. "Works for Me: A Recommendation Engine Takes On Fine Art." Time Magazine (June 4, 2012), 56-57.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have highlighted the subjective nature of genes and expressed a concern that they might be applied reductively.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/arts/design/artsy-is-mapping-the-world-of-art-on-the-web.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Verdaille''' is a painting executed entirely or primarily in shades of green. Such a painting is described as having been painted "''en verdaille''".&lt;ref name="Sale1380"&gt; Christie’s, ''Sale 1380, Old Master Paintings'', lot 49, New York, Christie’s, 17 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt;   

''Verdaille'' has its roots in 12th century [[stained glass]] made for [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monasteries, which prohibited the use of colored art in 1134. Such paintings are less common than paintings executed in grey (''[[grisaille]]'') or in brown (''[[brunaille]]'').&lt;ref name="Sale1380"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4685">A '''Virtual Season''' or '''Virtual Series''' is a [[fan_fiction|fan-driven]] continuation of a television program.  While they are typically written for [[Cancellation_(television)|cancelled programs]], they sometimes run concurrently with programs that are still airing original episodes.  Virtual Seasons can be written by a single author, by several collaborating authors in a [[fandom]], or even reproduced episodically in a single video or series of videos. These series can be written in [[screenplay]] or [[prose]] format.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Virtual_Season "Virtual Season"], [[Fanlore]] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Continuation "Continuation Fic"], ''TV Tropes''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScriptFic "Script Fic"], ''TV Tropes''&lt;/ref&gt;
