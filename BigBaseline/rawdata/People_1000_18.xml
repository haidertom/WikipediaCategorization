The '''Aberdeen doctors''' or '''Doctors of Aberdeen''' were six [[Divinity (academic discipline)|divine]]s working at [[Marischal College]] and [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]] in [[Aberdeen]], Scotland in the seventeenth century. Until 1635, they enjoyed the leadership of [[Patrick Forbes]], [[Bishop of Aberdeen]]. They are distinguished not only for their positions at Aberdeen, but also by their [[irenicism|irenicist]] opposition to the [[National Covenant of 1638]]. Their adherence to [[Episcopacy in the Church of Scotland|Episcopacy]] and their support for the [[Articles of the Assembly at Perth]] (1618), which prescribed several English forms of worship, form the backdrop of their opposition to the [[Presbyterian Covenanters]].

When Patrick Forbes was consecrated Bishop of Aberdeen in 1618, he [[Financial endowment|endowed]] a [[Professor (highest academic rank)|chair]] of divinity in each Aberdeen college. He revived the awarding of degrees in divinity which earlier Protestants had suppressed as [[prideful]] or as redolent of the Roman Catholic title [[Doctor of the Church]]. The early recipients of the [[Doctor of Divinity]] who stayed on to teach at the colleges became known as the "Aberdeen doctors".&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan 1909, pp.44–45&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Dury]] wrote to the doctors seeking their opinion on the points of dispute between the [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] and the [[Calvinism|Calvinists]]. Their reply of 20 February 1637 was supported by [[Robert Baillie]] but opposed by [[Samuel Rutherford]]. On 20 July 1638, a deputation seeking Aberdeen's adhesion to February's National Covenant arrived, comprising the [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose|Earl of Montrose]], [[Lord Cupar]], the [[Alexander Forbes, 10th Lord Forbes|Master of Forbes]], and Sir Thomas Burnett, Laird of Leyes representing the nobility; and [[Alexander Henderson (theologian)|Alexander Henderson]], [[David Dickson (minister)|David Dickson]], and [[Andrew Cant (minister)|Andrew Cant]], the ministry. The doctors were prepared to adhere provided satisfactory answers were given to 14 written questions, termed "demands". The Covenanter ministers' "answers" were submitted the following day, prompting "replies" from the doctors and "second answers" from the Covenanters, who then left the town. The doctors issued further replies which they called "duplies", which went unanswered. All the texts were quickly printed and widely circulated and debated.

The doctors' obduracy contributed to the [[First Bishops' War]] of 1639 in which the Covenanters sought the submission of Aberdeen.

==List==
The six doctors who participated in the 1638 disputation were:&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan 1909, pp.45–48&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[William Leslie (theologian)|William Leslie]], Principal of King's College, leader after death of Bishop Forbes in 1635
* [[John Forbes (died 1648)|John Forbes of Corse]], theologian at King's College and son of Bishop Forbes
* [[Alexander Scroggie]], scholar of King's College, Minister in [[Old Aberdeen]]
* [[Alexander Ross (Aberdeen doctor)|Alexander Ross]], Scholar of King's College, Minister in Aberdeen
* [[Robert Baron (theologian)|Robert Baron]], Professor of Divinity at Marischal, Minister in Aberdeen
* [[James Sibbald]],  Professor of Natural Philosophy at Marischal, Minister in Aberdeen

As well as Bishop Patrick Forbes, two other notable Aberdeen divines were associated with the six doctors:&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan 1909, pp.48–49&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[William Guild]], who subscribed to the six doctors' initial demands but then switched to the side of the Covenanters
* [[William Forbes (bishop)|William Forbes]], principal of Marischal until made [[Bishop of Edinburgh]] in 1634, months before his death

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8939">The '''Angel Makers of Nagyrév''' were a group of women living in the village of [[Nagyrév, Hungary]] who between 1914 and 1929 poisoned to death an estimated 300 people. They were supplied arsenic and encouraged to use it for the purpose by a midwife or "wise woman" named '''Susanna Fazekas''', wife of Julius Fazekas, née '''Susi Oláh''' (Fazekas Gyuláné Oláh Zsuzsanna).

Between 1911 and 1921 she was imprisoned 10 times for performing illegal [[abortion]]s, but was consistently [[acquittal|acquitted]] by judges supporting abortion.

In Hungarian society at that time, the future husband of a teenage bride was selected by her family and she was forced to accept her parents' choice. [[Divorce]] was not allowed socially, even if the husband was an [[alcoholic]] or [[domestic violence|abusive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Popham|first1=Peter|title=Hungary: Murder on the Danube|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/hungary-murder-on-the-danube-517007.html|accessdate=10 December 2016|work=The Independent|date=26 November 2005|ref=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War I]], when able-bodied men were sent to fight for [[Austria-Hungary]], rural Nagyrév was an ideal location for holding [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]].

After the initial killing of their husbands, some of the women went on to poison parents who had become a burden to them, or to get hold of their inheritance. Others poisoned their lovers, some even their sons; as the midwife allegedly told the poisoners, "Why put up with them?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Katie Heaney|title=11 Terrifying Female Serial Killers You've Never Heard Of|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/katieheaney/11-terrifying-female-serial-killers-youve-never-heard-of|website=BuzzFeed|accessdate=10 December 2016|date=15 Jul 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rubicon.hu/magyar/oldalak/arzenes_asszonyok_rendhagyo_sorozatgyilkossag_a_horthy_korban/&lt;/ref&gt;

The first poisoning in Nagyrév took place in 1911; it was not the work of Mrs. Fazekas. The deaths of other husbands, children, and family members soon followed. The poisoning became a fad, and by the mid-1920s, Nagyrév earned the nickname "the murder district." There were an estimated 45–50 murders over the 18 years that Mrs. Fazekas lived in the district. She was the closest thing to a doctor the village had and her cousin was the clerk who filed all the death certificates, allowing the murders to go undetected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Tonya Blust|title=Creepy crimes from the 1920s|url=http://www.historictruecrime.com/creepy-crimes-from-the-1920s/|website=www.historictruecrime.com|accessdate=10 December 2016|date=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three conflicting accounts have been cited to explain how the Angel Makers were eventually detected. In one, Mrs. Szabó, one of the Angel Makers, was caught in the act by two visitors who survived her poisoning attempts. She fingered a Mrs. Bukenoveski, who named Mrs. Fazekas. In another account, a medical student in a neighboring town found high arsenic levels in a body that washed up on the riverbank, leading to an investigation. However, according to Béla Bodó, a Hungarian-American historian and author of the first scholarly book on the subject, the murders were finally made public in 1929 when an anonymous letter to the editor of a small local newspaper accused women from the [[Tiszazug]] region of the country of poisoning family members. 

The authorities exhumed dozens of corpses from the local cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American front in the Hungarian village killer|url=http://eletmod.transindex.ro/?hir=3976|website=www.transindex.ro|publisher=Index Media Association|accessdate=10 December 2016|date=21 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 34 women and one man were indicted.  Afterwards, 26 of the Angel Makers were tried, among them Susi Oláh. Eight were sentenced to death but only two were [[capital punishment|executed]].  Another 12 received prison sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/036319900202700103 | author = Bodó, Béla | title = The poisoning women of Tiszazug | journal = Journal of Family History | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | year = 2002 | pages = 40–59 | pmid = 11789522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roussillon - Carte de Nicolas de Fer (1706).jpg|thumb|Map of the province of Roussillon by Nicolas de Fer (1706)]]
  
The '''Angelets''', or “the Angelets of the Earth” (in Catalan, ''“els Angelets de la Terra”''), were peasants who rose up from 1667 to 1675 against the French authorities of the [[Roussillon]] province. The group of conflicts of the period is subsumed under the name of “the '''Revolt of the Angelets'''”. The cause was the instituting of the [[gabelle]] (salt tax) in 1661 — a measure contrary to traditional constitutions of the earldom (the earldom of Roussillon and [[Cerdanya]], the lands of the crown of [[Majorca]] from 1276 to 1344).

The revolt first concerned the county of [[Vallespir]], then it won those of [[Conflent]] and Roussillon.

== The name ==

[[File:Guido Reni 031.jpg|thumb|The archangel of Saint Michael]]
The reason why the revolts are referred to as “angelets” is unknown. One of the explanations advanced is the popular belief according to which the angels know the mountains well; another is the faculty that they have of appearing and disappearing.

As for the word ''“miquelets,”'' it refers primarily to Catalan mercenaries but sometimes to armed peasants. There is thus confusion among the ancient authors, particularly in relation to the war of Holland: They designate under the name “''miquelets''” all those who, in the province of Roussillon, oppose the king of France — though it be angelets or Catalan mercenaries in the service of the king of Spain.

[[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]] is the patron saint of the miquelets and the wool-workers of [[Prats-de-Mollo-la-Preste|Prats-de-Mollo]], he who gave a sacred tint to one revolt that reclaimed liberties with the patriotic cry of ''“Visca la terra!”'' (“Long live the Land!”)

== Context ==

On May 8, 1659, the [[Reapers' War|Catalan Revolt]] came to an end, and on November 7, the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] was signed between the Spanish and the French monarchies. The agreement notably foresaw a sharing of the principality of Catalonia between the two sovereigns. The crown of France annexed five [[Comarques of Catalonia|comarques]] (corresponding to the two [[Counts]], minus lower Cerdanya and [[Llívia]]):

* the comarque of Roussillon
* Vallespir
* Conflent
* [[Capcir]]
* the burghs and villages of [[French Cerdagne]], that is the east of the count of Cerdagne

[[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] engaged himself with respecting the local customs.  But, since June 1660, he replaced Catalan institutions and agencies with his own political, judiciary, and fiscal structures.  He created a sovereign Council at [[Perpignan]]. Then he named a steward.

Resistance to the new master began in March 1661. Having come to settle a disagreement between the inhabitants of [[Ayguatébia-Talau|Ayguatébia]] and those of [[Oreilla]], the viguier (magistrate) Marsal was violently attacked.  He succeeded in escaping, but the notary and the domestic who accompanied him were killed.  Immediately, the comarque of Conflent was subjected to a tax intended to pay the sometent français (the militia).

=== The Gabelle ===

The [[gabelle]], a tax on salt, had been abolished by the Catalan courts since the time of King [[James II of Majorca]], in 1283. In 1661, the French reestablished it. Its revenue was intended to finance the maintenance and construction of fortresses, as well as the payment of French functionaries. The measure was very unpopular. The king of France’s misuse of this tax’s revenue — to the detriment of Perpignan, which was only cashing an insignificant part of it — was considered an abjuration of the royal oath to respect the capital privileges of the comarque of Roussillon. The consuls of Perpignan protested. But the sovereign Council’s decision rejected the municipal complaint and imposed the will of the Louvre.

In Vallespir, a country of pastures, salt was necessary for feeding livestock and preserving meat. The inhabitants sent for it from the other side of the wholly new border. The tax made its price rise inordinately. In 1667, the peasants of Vallespir refused to pay it.

== The First Revolt (1667–68) ==

Smuggling was organized. The inspectors tracked down the traffickers in order to try to put an end to this activity. The peasants reacted, transforming themselves into veritable guerrilla fighters, harassing the French soldiers and especially the functionaries of the salt tax. An armed resistance was organized under the leadership of Joseph of Trinxeria, a merchant of Prats-de-Mollo.

The insurgents spread themselves in the county of Vallespir. In 1667, they hid in the villages of [[Serralongue]] and [[Montferrer]]. The following year, they attacked the hotel of [[Amélie-les-Bains-Palalda|Amélie-les-Bains]], where the tax collectors are housed. They besieged the deputy provost Maniel in the church of [[Saint-Laurent-de-Cerdans]]. The repression did not rest: eight inhabitants were condemned to death and 51 put into slavery. This did nothing to discourage the smugglers.

The president of the sovereign Council, the collaborator Francesc de Segarra, offered a reward of 100 gold ''doubles tournois'' (coins) to whoever would give information against the leaders of the resistance. On September 14, 1668, he left with 300 soldiers to make base at [[Arles]] in order to begin a harsh suppression. The punitive expedition was routed at Llop pass and had to retreat to Arles.

For several years, the rebels, knowing the terrain well, inflicted substantial losses on the French troops.   From August 3, 1667 to June 30, 1668, they also pursued and eliminated a good number of salt tax inspectors.

The authorities of the salt tax resolved to negotiate: The armed struggle ceased and, in exchange, the townships of Vallespir could obtain smuggled salt. Through the “Compromise of [[Céret]],” the salt tax inspectors began to put an end to the controls and to coordinate with the council of each village, as to who would be charged from then on with the distribution of salt to the inhabitants.

== The Second Revolt (1670–74) ==

[[File:1674 - Plan bataille Maureillas.jpg|thumb|Battle plan near Maureillas in 1674]]
In 1669, in Conflent, Joan Miquel Mestre, called “the Righteous Heir,” demanded a similar arrangement for [[Baillestavy]]. From September to November, he kept track of the customs officers. It was at that moment that the revolts were referred to under the name of “angelets.”  Mestre was stopped by chance on the road from [[Camprodon]] on January 22, 1670 by the governor of Prats-de-Mollo. This set off a revolt on the part of the inhabitants, led by Josep de la Trinxeria and his lieutenant Damià Nohell, son of the mayor of Serralongue. They took the governor’s wife and children hostage and negotiated their release in return for that of the Righteous Heir. The exchange completed, the angelets returned via [[Tech (river)|the Tech]], seeing their troops grow to 1,500 men.

At this moment the revolt not only began again but also intensified considerably. The fighting stretched to all of Vallespir: On February 27, 1670, the insurgents seized Arles, from which they chased the garrison and killed the mayor. From March 31 to April 2, they besieged Céret, the capital of Vallespir.

The angelets held the high valley of Tech as well as Conflent. This was when the French sent an army of 4,000 soldiers. Avoiding offering an easy target on the route from the valley, they progressed through the mountains of Haut-Conflent that separated the two comarques, in order to take Vallespir from the rear. The technique of guerrilla warfare did not allow for maintaining a lined-up battle, on open terrain, facing a complete army: On May 5, the angelets were defeated at the Queen’s Pass, at the food of the Guillem Flat.   Some took refuge in the principality of Catalonia; others hid in the mountains.   The last bastion of the angelets having been defeated, the village of Py was sentenced to be razed.   Salt had to be scattered over its ruins.

=== Beginnings of the War of Holland ===

Hostilities were revived by the [[Franco-Dutch War]] (1672–78), of which the Spanish front became one of the theaters. The struggle of the population then took the character of an anti-French uprising. The angelets collaborated with the Spanish monarchy (1673).

The village and church of Ayguatébia were burned by French troops on February 7, 1673.

The year 1674 was particularly difficult for the French, in the province of Roussillon. They would face conspiracies (Villefranche and Perpignan) and an entry of Spanish troops.

=== The Villefranche Conspiracy ===

The angelets were involved in the Villefranche Conspiracy, which aimed to reunite the Counties at the principality of Catalonia, on “Holy Saturday” in 1674.

The conspiracy was discovered. Its leader, Manuel Descatllar, was arrested. He was transferred to Perpignan where, under terrible torture, he confessed all his activities. He was executed in the square of [[La Loge, Pas-de-Calais|La Loge]] on April 20, 1674. As for his companion Francesc Puig i Terrats, he was condemned to death and had his throat cut in public, in front of his own house, on May 16. His body was quartered. The four parts of him were exhibited at four points in the city. Many other conspirators paid for their involvement through the loss of their civic and patrimonial rights.

=== Repression and End of the Revolt ===

The population was always in question. The king of Spain’s troops crossed the frontier and took the fort of Bellegarde (beginning 1674). They controlled a great part of the province (Cerdagne and Vallespir, a part of Roussillon and of Conflent) after they won the [[Battle of Maureillas]] over the French army on July. It was only in 1675 that the [[Frederick Schomberg, 1st Duke of Schomberg|Count of Schomberg]], taking advantage of the Spanish withdrawal of troops to face the recent [[Revolt of Messina]], took back Bellegarde and routed them once and for all.

The region was now overrun with the French troops. The repression reached the whole population: imprisonment, sentencing to the galleys, executions, confiscation of goods, and heavy fines imposed on the communes (that of Prats-de-Mollo was of 3,500 pounds, that of Saint-Laurent was of 1,600 pounds).

The revolt of the angelets was considered finished in 1675.

The hatreds were so exacerbated, and the cost of suppression was so high, that Louis XIV tried to exchange the Counties in return for Flanders. But [[Charles II of Spain]] refused.

The revolt being completely put out, the king of France renounced this exchange during negotiations of the [[Treaties of Nijmegen|Treaty of Nijmegen]], which put an end, in 1678, to the Franco-Dutch War.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21730">The '''Belyayev circle''' ({{lang-ru|'''Беляевский кружок'''}}) was a society of Russian musicians who met in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]] between 1885 and 1908, and whose members included [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Alexander Glazunov]], [[Vladimir Stasov]], [[Anatoly Lyadov]], [[Alexander Ossovsky]], [[Witold Maliszewski]], [[Nikolai Tcherepnin]], [[Nikolay Sokolov (composer)|Nikolay Sokolov]], [[Alexander Winkler (composer)|Alexander Winkler]] among others. The circle was named after [[Mitrofan Belyayev]], a [[lumber|timber]] merchant and amateur musician who became a music philanthropist and publisher after hearing the music of the teenage Glazunov.

The Belyayev circle believed in a [[musical nationalism|national]] style of classical music, based on the achievements of the composer group [[The Five (composers)|The Five]] which preceded it. One important difference between composers in the Belyayev circle and their counterparts in the Five was an acceptance in the necessity of Western-styled academic training; this was an attitude passed down by Rimsky-Korsakov, who taught many of the composers in the circle at the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]]. While these composers were more open to Western compositional practices and influences, especially through the music of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], they closely followed many of the compositional practices of the Five to the point of mannerism, especially in their depiction of folkloric subject matter.

The Belyayev circle came to dominate musical life in St. Petersburg. Composers who desired patronage, publication or public performance of their works through Belyayev were compelled to write in a musical style accepted by Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov. There was also peer pressure to compose in this style, as well as a distrust of composers who did not do so. Several composers who believed in the philosophy of the Belyayev circle became professors and heads of music conservatories in Russia, which extended the influence of the group past the physical confines of St. Petersburg and timewise well into the 20th century.

==Belyayev==
{{see also|Mitrofan Belyayev}}
[[File:Belyayev by Repin.jpg|thumb|180px|right|alt=A middle-aged man with medium-length dark hair and a beard, wearing a dark suit, with one hand in his trouser pocket and the other hand on his chin|Portrait of [[Mitrofan Belyayev]] by [[Ilya Repin]]]]

Belyayev was one of a growing number of Russian nouveau-riche industrialists who became patrons of the arts in mid- to late-19th century Russia; their number included Nadezhda von Meck, railway magnate [[Savva Mamontov]] and textile manufacturer [[Pavel Tretyakov]].&lt;ref&gt;Figes, 195–197; Maes, 173–174, 196–197.&lt;/ref&gt; While Nadezhda von Meck insisted on anonymity in her patronage in the tradition of ''[[noblesse oblige]]'', Belyayev, Mamontov and Tretyakov "wanted to contribute conspicuously to public life".&lt;ref name="taruskin49"&gt;Taruskin, 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their cultural and political orientation, they were more likely than the aristocracy to support native talent, and were more inclined to support nationalist artists over cosmopolitan ones.&lt;ref name="taruskin42"/&gt; This was not due to any social or political agenda implicit in the art, but due to the Russianness of the art itself.&lt;ref name="taruskin42"&gt;Taruskin, 42.&lt;/ref&gt; This included the music of the composers Belyayev chose to support.&lt;ref name="taruskin42"/&gt;

An amateur [[viola]] player and [[chamber music]] enthusiast, Belyayev hosted "[[string quartet|quartet]] Fridays" at his home in St. Petersburg. A frequent visitor to these gatherings was Rimsky-Korsakov.&lt;ref&gt;Maes, 172–173.&lt;/ref&gt; Belyayev became a music patron after he had heard the [[Symphony No. 1 (Glazunov)|First Symphony]] by the sixteen-year-old Glazunov, who had been discovered by Balakirev and tutored by Rimsky-Korsakov in musical composition, [[counterpoint]] and orchestration. Not only did Glazunov become a fixture of the "quartet Fridays", but Belyayev also published Glazunov's work and took him on a tour of Western Europe. This tour included a visit to [[Weimar]], [[Germany]] to present the young composer to famed Hungarian composer and pianist [[Franz Liszt]].&lt;ref name="maes192"&gt;Maes, 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon Belyayev became interested in other Russian composers. In 1884 he set up an annual [[Glinka prize]], named after pioneer Russian composer [[Mikhail Glinka]] (1804–1857). In 1885 he founded his own music publishing firm, based in [[Leipzig]], Germany, through which he published works by Glazunov, Rimsky-Korsakov, Lyadov and Borodin at his own expense.&lt;ref name="maes173"/&gt; By publishing in Leipzig, Belyayev could offer the double benefit of higher quality music printing than was available in Russia at the time, plus the protection of international [[copyright]] which Russia did not offer.&lt;ref name="taruskin49"/&gt; At Rimsky-Korsakov's suggestion, Belyayev also founded his own concert series, the [[Russian Symphony Concerts]], open exclusively to Russian composers. Among the works written especially for this series were the three by Rimsky-Korsakov by which he is currently best known in the West—''[[Scheherazade]]'', the ''[[Russian Easter Festival Overture]]'' and ''[[Capriccio espagnol]]''. To select which composers to assist with money, publication or performances from the many who now appealed for help, Belyayev set up an advisory council made up of Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov. They would look through the compositions and appeals submitted and suggest which composers were deserving of patronage and public attention.&lt;ref name="maes173"&gt;Maes, 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The musical scene in St. Petersburg came to be dominated by the Belyayev circle since Rimsky-Korsakov had taught many of its members at the Conservatory there. Since Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov acted in an advisory capacity to the Belyayev enterprises, and thus became channels of Belyayev's largesse,&lt;ref name="taruskin56"/&gt; composers who wished to be part of this circle and who desired Belyayev's patronage had to write in a musical style approved by these three men.&lt;ref name="maes173"/&gt; Because of this stricture, Rimsky-Korsakov's style became the preferred academic style—one that young composers had to follow if they hoped to have any sort of career.&lt;ref name="maes173"&gt;Maes, 173.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the Belyayev circle acted as a compositional [[guild]].&lt;ref name="taruskin56"/&gt; The better pupils from the St. Petersburg Conservatory received initiation by their invitation to the "quartet Fridays", and admission to the circle "guaranteed well remunerated publication by Edition Belieff, Leipzig, and performance in the Russian Symphony Concert programs".&lt;ref name="taruskin56"&gt;Taruskin, 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Belyayev circle "set up an establishment that governed all aspects of musical creation, education and performance".&lt;ref name="taruskin56"/&gt;

==Philosophy==
The Belyayev circle ran counter in its philosophy to the artistic movement and magazine ''[[Mir iskusstva]]'' ({{lang-ru|«Мир иску́сства»}}, ''World of Art''). ''Mir iskusstva'' "identified with the artistic values of the [Russian] aristocracy" in its cosmopolitanism and belief of a universal culture.&lt;ref&gt;Figes, 268–269.&lt;/ref&gt; The composers of the Belyayev circle, like the Five before it, believed in a national, realist form of Russian classical music that should stand apart in its style and characteristics from Western European classical music. In this sense, the Belyayev composers shared similar goals with the [[Abramtsevo Colony]] and [[Russian Revival architecture|Russian Revival]] in the sphere of fine arts. Another way ''Mir iskusstva'' disagreed with the Belyayev circle was that they believed the composers under Belyayev were practicing art for art's sake, much like a social program. This practice ran counter to their belief in focusing on "art as the spiritual expression of the individual's creative genius", as they felt [[Alexander Pushkin]] had done in his poetry and Tchaikovsky in his music.&lt;ref&gt;Figes, 269.&lt;/ref&gt; Alfred Nurok commented in an 1899 review in ''Mir iskusstva'':

{{quote|Mr. Belyayev's [[Gaius Maecenas|Maecenas]] activities bear a very special imprint. His undeniably lavish patronage of Russian music of the newest variety does not, unfortunately, so much facilitate the development of the talents of gifted but as yet unrecognized composers, as it encourages young people who have successfully completed their conservatory course to cultivate productivity come what may, touching little upon the question of their creative abilities. Mr. Belyayev encourages industry above all, and under his [[aegis]] musical composition has assumed the character of a workers' collective (''[[artel]]''), or even a crafts industry.|&lt;ref&gt;As cited in Maes, 173.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Musicologist [[Richard Taruskin]] writes, "Within the Belyayev circle a safe conformism became increasingly the rule".&lt;ref name="taruskin57"&gt;Taruskin, 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Concert programs needed to be filled with new Russian works, and new works had to be published to offer to the music public. It was therefore necessary "to dip rather deep into the pool of available Conservatory trained talent", and the circle became known for the number of less-than-first-rate talents harbored within it.&lt;ref name="taruskin57"/&gt; Critic and composer [[César Cui]], who had been part of the Five along with Rimsky-Korsakov, derisively called these younger composers "clones".&lt;ref name="taruskin57"/&gt; Though there was some snobbism involved in criticism of the Belyayev circle, there was also enough truth in the issue of conformism to cause the circle some embarrassment.&lt;ref name="taruskin57"/&gt;
A contributing factor to this conformism was the gradual academization of composers in the nationalist circle, fueled by Rimsky-Korsakov's efforts in this regard with his students.&lt;ref name="mfw21403"&gt;Frolova-Walker, ''New Grove (2001)'', 21:403.&lt;/ref&gt; An increasing number of these students joined the Belyayev circle; the result was "the emergence of production-line 'Russian style' pieces, polished and correct, but lacking originality".&lt;ref name="mfw21403"/&gt;

==Comparison to the Five==
[[File:Glazunov by Repin.jpg|thumb|alt=A young man with reddish hair wearing a dark suit|Portrait of [[Alexander Glazunov]] by [[Ilya Repin]], 1887]]

The composers who formed the Belyayev circle were nationalistic in their outlook, as were the Five before them. Like the Five, they believed in a uniquely Russian style of classical music that utilized folk music and exotic melodic, harmonic and rhythmic elements, as exemplified by the music of Balakirev, Borodin and Rimsky-Korsakov. Unlike the Five, these composers also believed in the necessity of an academic, Western-based background in composition. The necessity of Western compositional techniques was something that Rimsky-Korsakov had instilled in many of them in his years at the St. Petersburg Conservatory.&lt;ref name="maes192"/&gt; Compared to the "revolutionary" composers in Balakirev's circle, Rimsky-Korsakov found those in the Belyayev circle to be "progressive ... attaching as it did great importance to technical perfection, but ... also broke new paths, though more securely, even if less speedily...."&lt;ref name="rk286"&gt;Rimsky-Korsakov, 286–287.&lt;/ref&gt;

Glazunov's attitude toward outside influences was typical of the Belyayev circle. He studied Tchaikovsky's works and "found much that was new ... that was instructive for us as young musicians. It struck me that Tchaikovsky, who was above all a lyrical and melodic composer, had introduced operatic elements into his symphonies. I admired the thematic material of his works less than the inspired unfolding of his thoughts, his temperament and the constructural perfection."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Lobanova, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Rimsky-Korsakov noted "a tendency toward [[eclecticism]]" among the composers in the Belyayev circle, as well as a "predilection ... for Italian-French music of the time of wig and [[farthingale]] [that is, the eighteenth century], music introduced by Tchaikovsky in his ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|Queen of Spades]]'' and ''[[Iolanthe (Tchaikovsky)|Iolanthe]]''".&lt;ref&gt;Rimsky-Korsakov, 309.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, while the Belyayev circle was more tolerant of outside influence to a certain degree than their predecessors under Balakirev,&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, ''New Grove (1980)'', 7:428.&lt;/ref&gt; they still followed the compositional practices of the Five closely. Maes writes, "The harmonies of [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s coronation scene in ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris]]'', the [[octatonic scale|octatonicism]] of ''[[Mlada (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Mlada]]'' and ''[[Sadko (opera)|Sadko]]'', Balakirev's folk-song stylizations, Rimsky-Korsakov's colorful [[harmony|harmonization]]—all these served as a store of recipes for writing Russian national music. In the portrayal of the national character ... these techniques prevailed over the subjects portrayed".&lt;ref name="maes192"/&gt;

==Folklorism, orientalism, "fantastic" style==
Unlike their predecessors in the Five, composers in the Belyayev circle did not concern themselves greatly with [[fakelore|folklorism]]—the invention or adaptation of [[folklore]] to newly written stories or songs, or to folklore that is reworked and modified for modern tastes. They also did not travel to other parts of Russia to actively search for folk songs, as Balakirev had done. When the Belyayev composers produced folkloric works, "they simply imitated Balakirev's or Rimsky-Korsakov's styles".&lt;ref&gt;Maes, 192–193.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the Belyayev composers, [[Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov]], continued the Five's work in musical [[orientalism]]—the use of exotic melodic, harmonic and rhythmic elements to depict the middle- and far-eastern parts of the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Figes, 390–391; Maes, 80–83.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote three operas set in an oriental background and composed in Balakirev's style—''Ruth'', ''Azra'' and ''Izmena''. The story for the last of these operas "deals with the struggle between Christians and Muslims during the sixteenth-century occupation of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] by the Persians".&lt;ref name="maes193"&gt;Maes, 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Ippolotov-Ivanov is best known in the West for his two sets of ''[[Caucasian Sketches]]'' "an orientalist orchestral work modeled on Balakirev and Borodin".&lt;ref name="maes193"/&gt;

Lyadov wrote in a "fantastic" vein akin to Rimsky-Korsakov's, especially in his tone poems based on Russian fairy tales, ''Baba Yaga'', ''Kikimora'' and ''The Enchanted Lake''.&lt;ref name="maes192"&gt;Maes, 192.&lt;/ref&gt; This style of musical writing was based on extensive use of the [[whole tone scale]] and the [[octatonic scale]] to depict supernatural or magical characters and events, hence the term "fantastic".&lt;ref&gt;Maes, 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt; Though he would break from the Belyayev aesthetic in subsequent works, [[Igor Stravinsky]] wrote his [[Ballet (music)|ballet]] ''[[The Firebird]]'' in a similar musical style.&lt;ref&gt;Maes, 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intolerance of non-compliant composers==
[[File:Young Rachmaninoff 2.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A clean-shaven young man with close-cropped hair, wearing a dark jacket, dress shirt with a high stiff collar and tie, looking toward the viewer with one hand on the side of his head|Sergei Rachmaninoff]]

Despite Rimsky-Korsakov's denial of bias among composers of the Belyayev circle,&lt;ref name="rk286"/&gt; musicologist [[Solomon Volkov]] mentions that they and the Five shared a mutual suspicion of compositions that did not follow its canon.&lt;ref name="volkov350"&gt;Volkov, ''St. Petersburg'', 350.&lt;/ref&gt; This proved especially true of the [[Symphony No. 1 (Rachmaninoff)|First Symphony]] of [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], a Moscow composer and protege of Tchaikovsky. Rimsky-Korsakov, whose own musical preferences in his later years were not overly progressive,&lt;ref&gt;Maes, 180—181.&lt;/ref&gt; may have sounded an advance warning on hearing the symphony in rehearsal when he told Rachmaninoff, "Forgive me, but I do not find this music at all agreeable".&lt;ref&gt;Bertenssohn and Leyva, 71.&lt;/ref&gt; By the reports of many present, the rehearsal that Rimsky-Korsakov had heard, conducted by Glazunov, was both a disaster as a performance and a horrific travesty of the score.&lt;ref name="har76"&gt;Harrison, 76.&lt;/ref&gt; The premiere, held in St. Petersburg on March 28, 1897, went no better. Cui wrote in his review of the work, among other things, "If there were a [[College or university school of music|conservatory]] in [[Hell]], and if one of its talented students were to compose a programme symphony based on the story of the [[Plagues of Egypt|Ten Plagues of Egypt]], and if he were to compose a symphony like Mr. Rachmaninoff's, then he would have fulfilled his task brilliantly and would delight the inhabitants of Hell".&lt;ref&gt;Cui, Ts., "Tretiy russkiy simfonicheskiy kontsert," ''Novosti i birzhevaya gazeta'' (17 March 1897(o.s.), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The symphony was not performed again in Rachmaninoff's lifetime,&lt;ref&gt;Bertenssohn and Leyva, 74.&lt;/ref&gt; and while Rachmaninoff did not destroy or disavow the score, he suffered a psychological collapse that led to a three-year creative hiatus.&lt;ref&gt;Bertenssohn and Leyva, 144–145; Norris, ''Rachmaninoff'', 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernism==
Maes writes that the composers who formed the Belyayev circle have often been described as "important links to, and pathbreakers for" modernist Russian composers such as Stravinsky and [[Sergei Prokofiev]]. This, he asserts, is actually a false assumption which suggests that modernism was the result of a gradual process.&lt;ref name="maes195"&gt;Maes, 195.&lt;/ref&gt; The truth, Maes suggests, was that modernist music in Russia was a much more radical break from the Belyayev circle than many have claimed.&lt;ref name="maes195"/&gt; Rimsky-Korsakov's extensive use of the [[octatonic scale]] and other harmonic experiments "was a gold mine for those bent on a modernist revolution," Maes writes. "However, the renewing force had still to be liberated from the cliches and routines into which the Belyayev aesthetic had been pressed".&lt;ref name="maes195"/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Dmitrij Dmitrijevič Šostakovič (Дми́трий Дми́триевич Шостако́вич).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A young man wearing round-framed glasses, a dark jacket, tie and dress shirt|Dmitri Shostakovich, 1925]]

Bias toward the musical aesthetics practiced by the Belyayev circle would continue at the St. Petersburg Conservatory after Rimsky-Korsakov's retirement in 1906,&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin, 73.&lt;/ref&gt; with his son-in-law [[Maximilian Steinberg]] in charge of composition classes at the Conservatory through the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] would complain about Steinberg's musical conservatism, typified by such phrases as "the inviolable foundations of the ''kuchka''" and the "sacred traditions of Nikolai Andreyevich [Rimsky-Korsakov]".&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Shostakovich to Tatyana Glivenko dated February 26, 1924. As quoted in Fay, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Nor was this traditionalism limited to St. Petersburg. Well into the Soviet era, many other music conservatories remained run by traditionalists such as Ippolitov-Ivanov in Moscow and [[Reinhold Glière]] in [[Petro Tchaikovsky National Music Academy of Ukraine|Kiev]]. Because of these individuals, Maes writes, "the conservatories retained a direct link with the Belyayev aesthetic".&lt;ref&gt;Maes, 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

If Creon had been the chief character in ''Œdipus''..."&lt;/ref&gt; although it became widely used after its appearance in ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]''  in 1749.&lt;ref&gt;Aston and Savona (1991, 34), quotation: {{quotation|[...] is first used in English to denote 'a personality in a novel or a play' in 1749 (''The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'', s.v.).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harrison1998p51/&gt; From this, the sense of "a part played by an [[actor]]" developed.&lt;ref name=Harrison1998p51&gt;Harrison (1998, 51-2) quotation: {{quotation|Its use as 'the sum of the qualities which constitute an individual' is a mC17 development.

A character who stands as a representative of a particular [[Social class|class]] or group of people is known as a type.&lt;ref name=b265&gt;Baldick (2001, 265).&lt;/ref&gt; Types include both [[stock character]]s and those that are more fully [[individual]]ised.&lt;ref name=b265/&gt; The characters in [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'' (1891) and [[August Strindberg]]'s ''[[Miss Julie]]'' (1888), for example, are representative of specific positions in the [[social relation]]s of class and [[gender]], such that the [[Conflict (narrative)|conflicts]] between the characters reveal [[Ideology|ideological]] conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Aston and Savona (1991, 35).&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of a character requires an analysis of its relations with all of the other characters in the work.&lt;ref&gt;Aston and Savona (1991, 41).&lt;/ref&gt; The individual status of a character is defined through the network of oppositions (proairetic, [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]], [[Linguistics|linguistic]], [[Proxemics|proxemic]]) that it forms with the other characters.&lt;ref&gt;Elam (2002, 133).&lt;/ref&gt; The relation between characters and the action of the story shifts historically, often [[Mimesis|miming]] shifts in society and its ideas about human [[individual]]ity, [[self-determination]], and the [[social order]].&lt;ref&gt;Childs and Fowler (2006, 23).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
{{Expand section|date=January 2018}}
In [[fiction writing]], authors create dynamic characters by many methods.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiBattista"/&gt; Sometimes characters are conjured up from imagination; in other instances, they are created by amplifying the character trait of a real person into a new fictional creation, or are created from scratch as a matter of expediency.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiBattista"/&gt;

==Types==

===Round vs. flat=== &lt;!-- Characterization links here. --&gt;
In his book ''Aspects of the Novel'', [[E. M. Forster]] defined two basic types of characters, their qualities, functions, and importance for the development of the novel: '''flat''' characters and '''round''' characters.&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoffman|first=Michael J|author2=Patrick D. Murphy|title=Essentials of the theory of fiction|publisher=Duke University Press, 1996|edition=2|pages=36|isbn=978-0-8223-1823-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flat characters are two-dimensional, in that they are relatively uncomplicated. By contrast, round characters are complex figures with many different characteristics, that undergo development, sometimes sufficiently to surprise the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forster|first=E.M.|title=Aspects of the Novel|year=1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mary Sue]]s are characters mainly appearing in [[fan fiction]]. They are virtually devoid of flaws,&lt;ref name="Bennett"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Lucy Bennett, Paul Booth|title=Seeing Fans: Representations of Fandom in Media and Popular Culture|isbn =1501318470|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]] USA|year=2016|page=160|accessdate=January 19, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ydwuDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA160}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are therefore considered flat characters.

===Dynamic vs. static===
'''Dynamic''' characters are those that change over the course of the story, while '''static''' characters remain the same throughout. An example of a popular static character in literature is [[Sherlock Holmes]]; an example of a dynamic character in literature is [[Ebenezer Scrooge]].

===Regular, recurring and guest characters===
In television, a regular, main or ongoing character is a character who appears in all or a majority of episodes, or in a significant chain of episodes of the series.&lt;ref&gt;The TV Writer's Workbook: A Creative Approach To Television Scripts [https://books.google.com/books?id=0YeCet_B_-IC&amp;pg=PA40 p. 40]&lt;/ref&gt; Regular characters may be both core and secondary ones. 

A [[recurring character]] often and frequently appears from time to time during the series' run.&lt;ref name="Crafty"&gt;{{cite book |last=Epstein |first=Alex |title=Crafty TV Writing: Thinking Inside the Box |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] |year= 2006 |isbn=0-8050-8028-7 |pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recurring characters often play major roles in more than one episode, sometimes being the main focus.

A guest character is one which acts only in a few episodes or scenes. Unlike regular characters, the guest ones do not need to be carefully incorporated into the storyline with all its ramifications: they create a piece of drama and then disappear without consequences to the narrative structure, unlike core characters, for which any significant conflict must be traced during a considerable time, which is often seen as an unjustified waste of resources.&lt;ref&gt;Greg M. Smith, ''Beautiful TV: The Art and Argument of Ally McBeal'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=joaM7TvhSzUC&amp;pg=PA147 p. 147]&lt;/ref&gt; There may also be a continuing or recurring guest character.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, [https://books.google.com/books?id=joaM7TvhSzUC&amp;pg=PA151 p. 151]&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes a guest character may gain popularity and turn into a regular one.&lt;ref&gt;David Kukoff, ''Vault Guide to Television Writing Careers'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=T9zj0AqB6bUC&amp;pg=PA62 p. 62]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical analysis==
{{further|Poetics (Aristotle)}}

In the earliest surviving work of [[dramatic theory]], ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE), the [[Greek philosophy|Classical Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] deduces that character (''[[ethos]]'') is one of six qualitative parts of [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] [[tragedy]] and one of the three objects that it [[Mimesis|represents]] (1450a12).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 8). Aristotle defines the six qualitative elements of tragedy as "plot, character, diction, reasoning, spectacle and song" (1450a10); the three objects are plot (''[[Mythos (Aristotle)|mythos]]''), character (''[[ethos]]''), and reasoning (''[[dianoia]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; He understands character not to denote a fictional person, but the quality of the person acting in the story and reacting to its situations (1450a5).&lt;ref name=j984&gt;Janko (1987, 9, 84).&lt;/ref&gt; He defines character as "that which reveals [[Decision making|decision]], of whatever sort" (1450b8).&lt;ref name=j984/&gt; It is possible, therefore, to have stories that do not contain "characters" in Aristotle's sense of the word, since character necessarily involves making the [[Ethics|ethical]] dispositions of those performing the action clear.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle writes: "Again, without action a tragedy cannot exist, but without characters it may. For the tragedies of most recent [poets] lack character, and in general there are many such poets" (1450a24-25); see Janko (1987, 9, 86).&lt;/ref&gt; If, in speeches, the speaker "decides or avoids nothing at all", then those speeches "do not have character" (1450b9—11).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 9).&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle argues for the primacy of [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] (''[[Mythos (Aristotle)|mythos]]'') over character (''[[ethos]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Aston and Savona (1991, 34) and Janko (1987, 8).&lt;/ref&gt; He writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But the most important of these is the structure of the incidents. For (i) tragedy is a representation not of human beings but of action and life. Happiness and unhappiness lie in action, and the end [of life] is a sort of action, not a quality; people are of a certain sort according to their characters, but happy or the opposite according to their actions. So [the actors] do not act in order to represent the characters, but they include the characters for the sake of their actions" (1450a15-23).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 8).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Aristotle suggests that works were distinguished in the first instance according to the nature of the person who created them: "the grander people represented fine actions, i.e. those of fine persons" by producing "hymns and praise-poems", while "ordinary people represented those of inferior ones" by "composing invectives" (1448b20—1449a5).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 5). This distinction, Aristotle argues, arises from two causes that are natural and common to all humans—the delight taken in experiencing representations and the way in which we learn through imitation (1448b4—19); see Janko (1987, 4—5).&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis, a distinction between the individuals represented in tragedy and in comedy arose: tragedy, along with [[epic poetry]], is "a representation of serious people" (1449b9—10), while [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] is "a representation of people who are rather inferior" (1449a32—33).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 6—7). Aristotle specifies that comedy does not represent all kinds of ugliness and vice, but only that which is laughable (1449a32—1449a37).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Tractatus coislinianus]]'' (which may or may not be by Aristotle), [[Ancient Greek comedy]] is defined as involving three types of characters: the [[buffoon]] (''[[bômolochus]]''), the [[Irony|ironist]] (''[[eirôn]]''), and the [[imposter]] or boaster (''[[alazôn]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 23) and Janko (1987, 45, 170).&lt;/ref&gt; All three are central to [[Aristophanes]]' "[[old comedy]]".&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 170).&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] comic playwright [[Plautus]] wrote his plays two centuries later, the use of characters to define dramatic [[genre]]s was well established.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 22).&lt;/ref&gt; His ''[[Amphitryon (Plautus play)|Amphitryon]]'' begins with a [[prologue]] in which [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] claims that since the play contains kings and gods, it cannot be a comedy and must be a [[tragicomedy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Amphritruo'', line 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the creation and criticism of fictional works, a '''character flaw''' is a limitation, imperfection, problem, [[phobia]], or deficiency present in a character who may be otherwise very functional. The flaw can be a problem that directly affects the character's actions and abilities, such as a violent temper. Alternatively, it can be a simple foible or personality defect, which affects the character's motives and social interactions, but little else.

Flaws can add depth and humanity to the characters in a [[narrative]].  For example, the sheriff with a gambling addiction, the [[action hero]] who is afraid of heights, or a lead in a [[romantic comedy]] who must overcome his insecurity regarding male pattern baldness are all characters whose flaws help provide dimension.  Perhaps the most widely cited and classic of character flaws is [[Achilles]]' famous heel.

In general, flaws can be categorized as ''minor'', ''major'', or ''tragic''.

==Minor flaw==
A minor character flaw is an imperfection which serves to distinguish the character in the mind of the reader / viewer / player / listener, making them memorable and individual, but otherwise does not affect the story in any way.

Examples of this could include a noticeable scar, a thick accent or a habit such as cracking their knuckles.

[[Protagonists]] and other major characters may (and usually do) have multiple minor flaws, making them more accessible, and enabling the reader / viewer / listener to relate to the character (in the case of a [[sympathetic character]]) or otherwise influence the audience's opinions of the character.

Many insignificant or archetypal characters which are encountered only once or rarely are defined solely by a single minor flaw, differentiating them from the [[stock character]] or [[archetype]] that they adhere to.

==Major flaw==
A major character flaw is a much more noticeable and important hindrance which actually impairs the individual, whether physically, mentally or morally. Sometimes major flaws are not actually negative per se (such as devout religious beliefs or a rigid code of honor), but are classified as such in that they often serve to hinder or restrict the character in some way.

Examples of this type of flaw could include blindness, [[amnesia]] or greed.

Unlike minor flaws, major flaws are almost invariably important to either the character's, or the story's development.

*For villains, their major flaw is usually the cause of their eventual downfall.
*For heroes, their major flaw usually must be overcome (either temporarily or permanently) at some point in the story, often at the climax, by their own determination or skill.
*For neutral characters, or those that shift allegiance, the major flaw is usually the cause of either their corruption, redemption or both.
*For the protagonist, the most visible flaw generally serves a more vital interest, as well, as it defines his or her core problem.  It is the protagonist's reluctant (and usually unconscious) journey to address this problem that forms the spine of the story, sometimes acting as the [[MacGuffin]] to stimulate the plot.

==Tragic/fatal flaw==
This is a specific sort of flaw, also known as "[[Hamartia]]", which is possessed by Aristotelian [[tragic hero]]s. It is a flaw which causes an otherwise noble or exceptional character to bring about their own downfall and, often, their eventual death.

Examples of this could include [[hubris]], misplaced trust, excessive curiosity, pride and lack of self-control.

This fall usually occurs at the beginning of a story, with the story itself concentrates on the consequences or attempted redemption of the fall.

== Examples ==

===Literature===
*[[Oedipus|Oedipus's]] downfall is directly linked to arrogance: ''[[Oedipus Rex]]''
*Macbeth suffers from [[hubris]], leading to the murder of [[Duncan I of Scotland]]; he later becomes [[paranoia|paranoid]], leading him to order the deaths of [[Banquo]] and the family of [[Macduff (Macbeth)|Macduff]]: ''[[Macbeth]]''
*[[Hamlet]] is indecisive and self-doubting, which thwarts him in avenging his father's murder.
*[[Victor Frankenstein]] suffers from excessive curiosity and irresponsibility, leading to the creation of the [[Frankenstein's monster|monster]] that destroys his life: ''[[Frankenstein]]''
*[[Sigurd]] has a vulnerable spot on his back, where a linden leaf fell as he was bathing in dragon's blood: ''[[Volsunga saga]]'' 
*[[Agamemnon]] acts in greed when he takes [[Briseis]] away from [[Achilles]], losing the warrior's support in the [[Trojan War]]: ''[[The Iliad]]''. Achilles's own flaw was his own arrogance.

*[[Tom Riddle|Tom Riddle's]] extreme [[thanatophobia]] eventually transformed him into the vile Lord Voldemort in his pursuit for [[immortality]]. (''[[Harry Potter]]'')
*[[Harry Potter]]'s worst flaws, as stated by Rowling, are "anger and occasional arrogance." However, within the text, it is implied his flaw might be his heroic desire to save people. (''[[Harry Potter]]'')
*[[Percy Jackson]] has a fatal flaw of excessive personal loyalty, while his girlfriend Annabeth Chase shares the flaw of the legendary Odysseus: hubris. (''[[Percy Jackson and the Olympians]]'')
*[[Jo March]]'s bluntness and hot temper cause conflict with her family. ''[[Little Women]]''
*In the ''[[Star Wars Expanded Universe|Star Wars Legends]]'' continuity, [[Jacen Solo|Jacen Solo's]] eventual downfall is linked to his placing the weight of the galaxy on his shoulder in his desire for peace.

===Film===
*In ''[[Rocky]]'', [[Rocky Balboa]] thinks of himself as a loser who cannot go the distance in the boxing ring.
*[[Anakin Skywalker]]'s anger and fear of losing his wife [[Padme Amidala|Padme]] eventually consumes him, leading to his transformation into [[Darth Vader]]. Whereas his mentor [[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi's]] compassion and love for his student blinded him to the path Skywalker was taking. (''[[Star Wars]]'')
*In ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', Rick thinks of himself as an unfeeling cynic who denies the pain and disappointment from a failed love affair with Ilsa.
*In ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', the detective played by [[James Stewart]] is afraid of heights and has to climb a tower.
*[[Captain Hook]] is obsessed with ''[[Peter Pan]]''
*[[Characters in Blade Runner#Roy Batty|Roy Batty]], as a replicant, is powerful, but has a very short lifespan: ''[[Blade Runner]]''
*[[Oskar Schindler]] in the film ''[[Schindler's List]]'' must overcome his greedy nature and find compassion to sacrifice in order to save his workers

*[[Londo Mollari]] yearns to return to the "glory days" of the [[Centauri Republic]]: ''[[Babylon 5]]''
*[[Mr. Spock]] relies heavily on logic and suppresses his more human emotions: ''[[Star Trek]]''
*[[Drake Mallard|Darkwing Duck/Drake Mallard]] has a big ego. ''[[Darkwing Duck]]''
*[[Peter Griffin]] is extremely impulsive and causes many problems for his family and friends: ''[[Family Guy]]''
*[[Zuko]] makes misguided decisions in an effort to gain his cruel father's acceptance: ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''
*[[Aang]] is too carefree and initially attempts to run from his responsibilities rather than face them: ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''
*[[Dean Winchester]] relies on family and is devastated when he loses them or they betray his trust: ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]''
*[[The Tenth Doctor]] is constantly trying to help and save the lives of others, and sometimes does things out of anger that have dire consequences later: ''[[Doctor Who]]''
*[[Mr. Gold|Rumplestiltskin's]] greatest character flaw was his greed, losing even those who love him over his mad desire for power. He shares this flaw with his former student and lover [[Cora Mills|Cora]]. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'') 
*[[Zelena (Once Upon a Time)|Zelena's]] envy of her younger half-sister [[Regina Mills]] eventually transformed her into the infamous [[Wicked Witch of the West]] as she planned to reverse time and supplant Regina. Even after this plan was thwarted, her envy remained a great character flaw throughout her time on the show. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')
*After the death of her fiance Daniel Colter, [[Regina Mills|Regina]] suffered a mental breakdown and became consumed with anger, which Rumplestiltskin was able to use to shape her into the Evil Queen who would cast his Dark Curse. Anger, as a fatal flaw, is one she shares with [[Hook (Once Upon a Time)|Killian Jones]] whose own anger transformed him into vengeful [[Captain Hook]]; however, Hook did not share Regina's mental instability. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')
*The main character flaw of the protagonist of the series, [[Emma Swan]], are her tendency to mistrust other people, which leads her to put up emotional barriers to protect herself and run when things get difficult. Her overcoming this flaw is a major story arc on the show. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')

===Gaming===
* In [[Warhammer 40,000]], the Primarch Lorgar Aurelian is extremely devout and reveres his "father", the Emperor of Mankind, as a god. The Emperor envisages a human civilization free of the shackles of religion and dogma and chastises Lorgar and his legion for worshipping him. Hurt and depressed by the humiliation of his father's rebuke, Lorgar and the [[Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)|Space Marines]] of the XVII Legion (the "Word Bearers") search for another purpose to sustain them, and in doing so become the first legion to fall under the malicious influence of [[Chaos (Warhammer)|Chaos]]. Their devotion to Chaos sees them instigate the devastating civil war known as the [[Horus Heresy (fictional event)|Horus Heresy]], the events of which led to the current dystopian setting of Warhammer 40,000.
*In ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'', Liquid's jealousy of Solid Snake's "dominant genes" and his desire to be the better of the two sets much of the story in motion, leading to Liquid's eventual downfall.
*In the ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'' series, [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]] acts brutally and violently out of anger and desire for revenge, with devastating consequences on his only life and the world around him.

On 18 March 2013, [[Pope Francis]] adopted in his [[papal coat of arms]] the [[coat of arms]] and the [[motto]] that he used since his [[episcopal consecration]] in 1991, differenced following his election as [[Supreme Pontiff]].&lt;ref name="OR"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/francesco/elezione/stemma-papa-francesco_it.html | title=Lo Stemma di Papa Francesco | publisher=[[L'Osservatore Romano]] | date=March 18, 2013 | access-date=March 18, 2013 | language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charges and field==
His [[coat of arms]] displays three [[Charge (heraldry)|charges]] on a blue [[Field (heraldry)|field]]. In reference to Francis being a [[Jesuit]], the uppermost charge is the emblem of the [[Society of Jesus]].&lt;ref name="OR"/&gt; The emblem is composed of a  [[Sun (heraldry)|Sun radiant]], within which is the IHS [[christogram]] (a [[monogram]] of the [[Holy Name of Jesus]]) in red, with a red cross surmounting the H and three black nails below the H.&lt;ref name="OR"/&gt; 

Below the Jesuit emblem is an eight-pointed star, the [[Our Lady, Star of the Sea|star]] being  a long-standing symbol of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], and a [[spikenard]] representing [[Saint Joseph]].&lt;ref name="OR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VIS"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.news.va/en/news/pope-francis-miserando-atque-eligendo | title=Pope Francis : "Miserando atque eligendo"... | publisher=[[Vatican Information Service]] | date=March 18, 2013 | accessdate=March 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= NCR/&gt; In [[Hispanic]] iconographic tradition Saint Joseph is often depicted with a branch of spikenard in his hand.&lt;ref name="OR2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/francesco/elezione/stemma-papa-francesco_it.html | title=Lo Stemma di Papa Francesco | publisher=[[L'Osservatore Romano]] | date=March 18, 2013 | accessdate=4 December 2016 | language=Italian}} "La stella, secondo l’antica tradizione araldica, simboleggia la Vergine Maria, madre di Cristo e della Chiesa; mentre il fiore di nardo indica San Giuseppe, patrono della Chiesa universale. Nella tradizione iconografica ispanica, infatti, San Giuseppe è raffigurato con un ramo di nardo in mano."&lt;/ref&gt; 

These charges appeared on Bergoglio's previous coat of arms displayed when he was [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Buenos Aires|Archbishop of Buenos Aires]],&lt;ref name= NCR&gt;{{cite news |title=Pope stresses simplicity, ecumenism in inaugural Mass plans |url= http://ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/pope-stresses-simplicity-ecumenism-inaugural-mass-plans|newspaper= [[National Catholic Reporter]] |date=18 March 2013 |accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as Pope the [[tincture (heraldry)|tincture]] of the star and the spikenard were elevated from ''Argent'' (silver) to ''Or'' (gold). The first version of the [[Coats of arms of the Holy See and Vatican City|papal coat of arms]] published by the Vatican showed a five-pointed star from Bergoglio's previous one, but this was later amended to eight points; the representation of the spikenard was also slightly altered so it would resemble leaves rather than what appears to look like grapes.

==Blazon==

The Vatican has not yet published the official [[blazon]] of the arms, but an approximation has been made by John Hamilton Gaylor, as follows:
:''Azure on a Sun in Splendour Or the IHS Christogram ensigned with a Cross paty fitchy piercing the H Gules all above three Nails fanwise points to centre Sable, and in dexter base a Mullet of eight points and in sinister base a Spikenard flower Or.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wedvick of Jarlsby - Religious/Francis, H.

==External ornaments==
Traditionally, a [[Pope]]'s coat of arms was externally adorned only by the three-tiered [[Papal Tiara|papal tiara]] with lappets and the crossed keys of [[Saint Peter]] with a cord. The tiara represented the roles of authority of the Pope, while the keys represent the power to loose and bind in Heaven as on earth.&lt;ref&gt;({{bibleverse||Matt|16:19|63}})&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Francis' arms maintain the keys, but replaced the tiara (as did his predecessor) with a [[mitre|triband mitre]]. 

The [[Papal Tiara|tiara]] and keys remain the symbol of the [[papacy]] and appear on the [[coat of arms]] of the [[Holy See]] and (reversed) on the flag of [[Vatican City]].

===Mitre===
[[File:BANDERA GUARDIA VATICA PANCHO.svg|thumb|right|250px|[[Banner of the Pontifical Swiss Guard]] with Pope Francis' coat of arms]]
As with his [[Coat of arms of Pope Benedict XVI|predecessor's personal arms]], Francis replaced the traditional [[papal triregnum]] by adopting a [[tincture (heraldry)|silver]] [[mitre]] with three gold bands. These bands allude to the papal tiara's three [[crown (headgear)|crown]]s, which came to represent the three powers of Orders, Jurisdiction, and Magisterium, all joining at the centre depicting unity in the same person. Coincidentally, the three stripes and the vertical stripe in the center of the mitre also forms the Chinese character for “sovereign” (王).

===Motto===
[[File:Coat of arms of Jorge Mario Bergoglio.svg|thumb|Coat of arms as Cardinal Bergoglio]]
Unusually, Francis also decided to retain his personal [[motto]]: ''Miserando atque eligendo''. It is taken from the 21st [[homily]] of [[Bede|Saint Bede]], which is on the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and refers to the [[vocation]] of [[Saint Matthew]].&lt;ref name="OR"/&gt; He writes:

:"Vidit ergo Iesus publicanum et quia '''miserando atque eligendo''' vidit, ait illi 'Sequere me'." (Om. 21; CCL 122, 149-151)
:"Jesus saw the tax collector and, because '''he saw him through the eyes of mercy and chose him''', he said to him: Follow me." (trans. ''[[Liturgy of the Hours]]'' 1975, p. 1418)

Bede is here discussing Matthew 9:9-13. The salient point is that Jesus chose Matthew as his disciple not in spite but because of his being a sinner. In the Douay Rheims translation: 
&lt;ol start=9&gt;&lt;li&gt; And when Jesus passed on from hence, he saw a man sitting in the custom house, named Matthew; and he saith to him: Follow me. And he rose up and followed him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; And it came to pass as he was sitting at meat in the house, behold many publicans and sinners came, and sat down with Jesus and his disciples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; And the Pharisees seeing it, said to his disciples: Why doth your master eat with publicans and sinners?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; But Jesus hearing it, said: They that are in health need not a physician, but they that are ill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Go then and learn what this meaneth, I will have mercy and not sacrifice. For I am not come to call the just, but sinners.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

The statement from the Vatican announcing the Pope's coat of arms and motto explained that the phrase had a special meaning for Francis as he felt it recalled his own vocation, when at the age of 17, he went to [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|confession]] on St Matthew's day in 1953.&lt;ref name="OR"/&gt;

The '''coat of arms of the King of Spain''' is the [[heraldic symbol]] representing the monarch of Spain. The current version of the monarch's coat of arms was adopted in 2014 but is of much older origin. The arms marshal the arms of the former monarchs of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castille]], [[Kingdom of León|León]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], and [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]].

Traditionally, coats of arms did not belong to a nation but to the monarch who would quarter his shield with territorial claims of his dynasty. Formerly, the Spanish monarch's arms were much more complex than they are today. It would feature the arms of the various territories of this dynasty. A simpler version of these arms, known as the ''lesser arms'', would also be used; This lesser arms were another set of arms within the centre of the full arms. During the later part of the Bourbon dynasty this would be quarterly Castille and Leon.

In 1868, during the [[Provisional Government (1868-1871)|provisional government]] that followed the overthrow of Queen [[Isabella II]], an arms of ''national character'' was adopted; This 1868 arms created the present-day arrangement of elements in the shield. The "national arms" and "royal arms" would coexist after the restoration of the monarchy. In 1931, the royal arms was revised to incorporate what had been hitherto the "national arms" into the royal arms and to replace the former lesser arms of the King (i.e. quarterly Castille and Leon). The monarchy would later be abolished later that year.

When don Juan Carlos, grandson of Alfonso XIII (the last king of Spain), was chosen to be the successor of General [[Francisco Franco]], the arms adopted for his use in 1971 as Prince of Spain was quarterly Castille, Leon, Aragon, and Navarre. The heraldic achievement also included the collar of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]], the Cross of Burgundy and the yoke and bundle of arrows formerly used by the [[Catholic Monarchs]]; This would be the same arms he would use as King. Upon Felipe VI's ascension to the throne in 2014, the cross, yoke, and arrows would not be retained in the royal arms.

==Blazon==
The [[blazon]]ing of the coat of arms of the King of Spain is set out in Royal Decree 527/2014, 20 June, an amendment to Title II of Spanish Royal Decree 1511/1977 adopting Flags, Standards, Guidons, Insignia and Emblems Regulation.&lt;ref name="BOE527"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2014/06/21/pdfs/BOE-A-2014-6525.pdf |title=Real Decreto 527/2014, de 20 de junio, por el que se crea el Guión y el Estandarte de Su Majestad el Rey Felipe VI y se modifica el Reglamento de Banderas y Estandartes, Guiones, Insignias y Distintivos, aprobado por Real Decreto 1511/1977, de 21 de enero. |date=20 June 2014 |website= BOE Spanish Official Journal|series= |publisher= |location= |page= |pages= |at= |language= Spanish|trans-title=Royal Decree 527/2014 setting up the Guidon and Standard of HM King Felipe VI and amends Standards, Guidons, Insignia and Emblems Regulation, adopted on Royal Decree 1511/1977|accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coat of arms was adopted when King [[Felipe VI of Spain|Felipe VI]] was enthroned as King of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldo.es/noticias/nacional/2014/06/19/felipe_cuenta_con_escudo_guion_propios_294797_305.html |title=Felipe VI ya cuenta con escudo y guión propios |language=Spanish |trans-title=Felipe VI has his own coat of arms and guidon |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= 2014-06-19|website=www.heraldo.es |publisher= |accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shield is divided into four quarters, blazoned as follows:

*1st, [[gules]] a castle [[Or (heraldry)|or]], triple-embattled and voided gate and windows, with three towers each triple-turreted, of the field, masoned [[sable]] and ajoure [[azure (heraldry)|azure]], which is for [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]];
*2nd, [[argent]] a lion [[rampant]] purpure crowned or, langued and armed, of the second, which is for [[Kingdom of León|León]];
*3rd, or, four pallets gules, which is for [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]];
*4th, gules a cross, saltire and orle of chains linked together or, a centre point vert, which is for [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]];

Argent enté en point, with a pomegranate proper seeded gules, supported, sculpted and leafed in two leaves vert, which is for [[Granada]].

Inescutcheon [[azure (heraldry)|azure]] [[bordure]] gules, three [[fleurs-de-lys]] or, which is for [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon-Anjou]].

All surrounded by the collar of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece|Golden Fleece]] and crowned with a crown of the same metal and precious stones, with eight rosettes, five visible, and eight pearls interspersed, closed at the top by eight diadems also adorned with pearls and surmounted by a cross on a globe, which is the royal crown of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casareal.es/sm_rey/armas-iden-idweb.html Coat of arms of His Majesty the King of Spain]. The Royal Household of the King of Spain. Retrieved 19 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, General [[Francisco Franco]] appointed [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos I]] as his "successor to the Headship of the Spanish state with the title of King" but gave him the new title of [[Prince of Spain]] instead of the traditional title of [[Prince of Asturias]]. From 1971 to 1975, Juan Carlos as Prince of Spain used a coat of arms which was virtually identical to the one later adopted when he became King in 1975. Earlier coat of arms differed only that it featured the royal crown of a Crown Prince of Spain, the King's royal crown has eight half-arches of which five are visible, while the Prince's one has only four half-arches of which three are visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.armada.mde.es/ArmadaPortal/page/Portal/ArmadaEspannola/conocenos_historia/03_bandera_armada--14_miscelania--02_insignias_jefes_estado--05_juan_carlos_i_es ''Spanish Decree 814 of 22nd April 1971''].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4585">'''Creirwy''' ({{IPA-cy|ˈkrəirʊɨ}}) is a figure in the ''[[Mabinogion]]'' and the ''[[s:The Mabinogion/Taliesin|Hanes Taliesin]]'' (the story of [[Taliesin]]'s life), daughter of the enchantress [[Ceridwen]] and [[Tegid Foel]] ("Tacitus the Bald"). The [[Welsh Triads]] name her one of the three most beautiful maids of the Isle of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Triads of Britain|Triads of Britain]]&lt;/ref&gt; Born in [[Penllyn (cantref)|Penllyn]] in [[Powys]], Wales, Creirwy (also known as ''Llywy'') has a dark, hideous brother named [[Morfran]] and a foster brother, [[Gwion Bach]] (who would become the bard Taliesin). She does not appear in the stories about [[Afagddu]] and Taliesin.

==Interpretation as a goddess==
[[Celtic Revival|Celtic]] researcher [[Edward Davies (Celtic)|Edward Davies]] deemed Creirwy "the [[Proserpina|Proserpine]] of the [[Britons (historical)|British]] [[Druid]]s"—also [[Comparative mythology|comparing]] her mother Ceridwen to [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] of Roman myth.&lt;ref name=virago&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/mythologyritesof00davirich ''The Mythology and Rites of the British Druids''], [https://archive.org/stream/mythologyritesof00davirich#page/205/mode/1up/ page 205]&lt;/ref&gt; Mythographer [[Jacob Bryant]] theorized that Creirwy and Ceridwen were essentially "the same mystical personage."&lt;ref name=virago /&gt;

Her name possibly means "sacred symbol of the egg" (i.e., "[[mundane egg]]", "[[adder stone]]") from the Welsh elements ''creir'' "a token, jewel, sacred object, relic, talisman, treasure, richly decorated article, object of admiration or love, darling, safeguard, strength, hand-bell, church-bell"&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, August. [http://thedarkavalonbooks.wordpress.com/2011/01/26/creirwy-the-lake-monster-of-bala-lakellyn-tegid/ "Creirwy, the Lake Monster of Bala Lake/Llyn Tegid?"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120719142009/http://thedarkavalonbooks.wordpress.com/2011/01/26/creirwy-the-lake-monster-of-bala-lakellyn-tegid/ |date=2012-07-19 }} ''Dark Avalon Books''. Retrieved 1 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''wy'' "egg".&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:ŵy|Wiktionary: "ŵy"]]&lt;/ref&gt; For the ancient Druids, the mundane egg allegedly symbolized chaos, the beginning of all things, and upon it oaths were administered.

==Saint Creirwy==
This was also the name of a 6th-century Breton saint from Wales, daughter of Saint [[Gwen Teirbron|Gwen the Triple-Breasted]] and sister of the great regional saint [[Winwaloe]]. According to [[hagiographies]] of Winwaloe, Saint Creirwy ({{lang-la|Creirvia}}; {{lang-br|'''Klervi'''}}) as a young girl had one or both eyes gouged out by a wild [[goose]], but Winwaloe retrieved the eyeball(s) from the gander's belly and returned it/them to his little sister's [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbit(s)]], and Creirwy's eyesight was miraculously restored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://louis.buchillot.perso.sfr.fr/page369.htm#fiche5 "Sainte Chreirbia" (in French)]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, she is allegedly a patron saint of the blind. The story is memorialized in a 16th-century statue in Keravézan, [[Saint-Frégant]]; known as ''la fontaine de Saint Guénolé'', it depicts Winwaloe (Guénolé) holding the goose and the eyeball, with little Creirwy at his feet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://saint-fregant.e-monsite.com/pages/patrimoine/fontaine-de-saint-guenole.html Fontaine de Saint-Guénolé (in French)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:br:Restr:St Frégant 2.jpg|A photo of the statue of Winwaloe and Creirwy on Breton Wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the legend is dismissed by [[Sabine Baring-Gould|Baring-Gould]] and Fisher, who say it originated with an expression that "Creirwe" used; supposedly she would often say she "owed her eye to Winwaloe", but in reference to a much more ordinary childhood event, in which her brother stepped in and protected her when a wild goose flew at Creirwy and almost pecked out her eye.&lt;ref&gt;Anna of the blog ''Early Western Saints''.

== Early life ==
Boyd grew up in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]] and [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]],&lt;ref name=age/&gt; and attended [[Manheim Township High School]] from 1992–1996. According to her website, she was born Danah Michele Mattas.&lt;ref name="db_hompage_name"/&gt; Once she reached college, she chose to take her maternal grandfather's name, Boyd, as her own last name. She decided to spell her name in lowercase so as "to reflect my mother's original balancing and to satisfy my own political irritation at the importance of capitalization."&lt;ref name=age/&gt;&lt;ref name="db_hompage_name"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
After her parents' divorce, in 1982, she moved to [[York County, Pennsylvania|York]], [[Pennsylvania]], with her mother and her brother. Her mother married again during danah's third grade and the family moved to [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster, Pennsylvania]]. She used online discussions forums to escape from high school. She called Lancaster a "religious and conservative" city. Having had online discussions on the topic, she decided to start identifying as [[queer]].&lt;ref name="lemonde.fr"&gt;http://www.lemonde.fr/festival/article/2014/08/20/danah-boyd-anthropologue-de-la-generation-numerique_4473731_4415198.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years later, her brother taught her how to use [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] and [[Usenet]]. Even though she thought computers were "lame" at the time, the possibilities for connecting with others intrigued her. She became an avid participant on Usenet and IRC in her junior year in high school, spending a lot of time browsing, creating content, and conversing with strangers.&lt;ref name="danah.org"&gt;http://www.danah.org/aboutme.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Though active in many extra-curricular activities and excelling academically, boyd had a difficult time socially in high school. She assigns "her survival to her mother, the Internet, and a classmate whose misogynistic comments inspired her to excel."&lt;ref name="danah.org"/&gt;

Her initial ambition was to become an astronaut but after an injury, she became more interested in the Internet.&lt;ref name=age&gt;{{cite news|title=A space of her own – Encounter with Danah Boyd|work=The Age |location=Australia|date=August 4, 2007|author=Debelle, Penelope}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education ==
[[File:Danah Boyd.jpg|thumb|danah boyd in 2005, a speaker at Digital Identity conference in Chicago.]]
Boyd initially studied [[computer science]] at [[Brown University]], where she worked with [[Andries van Dam]] and wrote an undergraduate thesis about how "3-D computer systems used cues that were inherently sexist."&lt;ref name=age/&gt;  She pursued her master's degree in sociable media with [[Judith Donath]] at the [[MIT Media Lab]]. She worked for the New York-based activist organization [[V-Day (movement)|V-Day]], first as a volunteer (starting in 2004) and then as paid staff (2007–2009). She eventually moved to San Francisco, where she met the individuals involved in creating the new [[Friendster]] service.

==Career==
[[File:Danah Boyd (12776738645).jpg|thumb|Visualisation from one of boyd's lectures by Willow Brugh]]
While in graduate school, she was involved with a three-year ethnographic project funded by the MacArthur Foundation and led by [[Mimi Ito]]; the project examined youths' use of technologies through interviews, focus groups, observations, and document analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitallearning.macfound.org/site/c.enJLKQNlFiG/b.4773555/k.27DE/Mizuko_Ito.htm |title=MacArthur Foundation Project Summary |accessdate=January 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalyouth.ischool.berkeley.edu/report |title=Final Report |work=The Digital Youth Project |accessdate=January 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her publications included an article in the ''MacArthur Foundation Series on Digital Learning, Identity Volume'' called "Why Youth (Heart) Social Network Sites: The Role of Networked Publics in Teenage Social Life."&lt;ref name=SocialNetwork&gt;{{cite journal |last=boyd |first=danah |editor1-first=David |editor1-last=Buckingham |editor1-link= |title=Why Youth (Heart) Social Network Sites: The Role of Networked Publics in Teenage Social Life |journal=Youth, Identity, and Digital Media |series=The John D. and Catherine T.

The project culminated with a co-authored book "Hanging Out, Messing Around, and Geeking Out: Kids Living and Learning with New Media."&lt;ref name="HangingOut"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ito |first=Mimi |title=Hanging Out, Messing Around, and Geeking Out: Kids Living and Learning with New Media |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |date=September 2009 |isbn=0-262-01336-3|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She published untraditional research on youth using Facebook and MySpace in 2007. She demonstrated that most young users of Facebook were white and middle-to-upper class, while MySpace users tended to be lower-class black teenagers. Her work is often translated and relayed to major media.&lt;ref name="lemonde.fr" /&gt; In addition to blogging on her own site, she addresses issues of youth and technology use on the [http://dmlcentral.net DMLcentral] blog. boyd has written academic papers and [[op-ed]] pieces on online culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shirky |first=Clay |authorlink=Clay Shirky |title=[[Here Comes Everybody]] |publisher=[[Penguin Group]] |date=February 28, 2008 |pages=224–5 |isbn=978-1-59420-153-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her career as a fellow at [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society|Harvard's Berkman Center]] started in 2007. In January 2009, boyd joined [[Microsoft Research]] New England, in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], as a Social Media Researcher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-10047795-36.html|title=Microsoft hires social-net scholar Danah Boyd|author=McCarthy, Caroline|date=September 22, 2008|publisher=[[CNET]]|accessdate=January 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, boyd founded [https://datasociety.net/ Data &amp; Society Research Institute] to address the social, technical, ethical, legal and policy issues that are emerging from data-centric technological development.

She was interviewed in the 2015 web documentary about internet privacy, ''[[Do Not Track (documentary)|Do Not Track]]''.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/14/brett-gaylor-do-not-track-interactive-documentary-privacy|title=Do not Track: an online, interactive documentary about who’s watching you|last=Davis|first=Nicola|date=14 April 2015|work=The Guardian|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, boyd is president of [[Data &amp; Society]],&lt;ref&gt;https://datasociety.net&lt;/ref&gt; a Principal Researcher at [[Microsoft Research]] and a Visiting Professor at [[New York University]]. She also serves on the board of directors of [[Crisis Text Line]] (since 2012),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/in/danahboyd&lt;/ref&gt; as a Trustee of the National Museum of the American Indian, on the board of the Social Science Research Council, and on the advisory board of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC). Boyd is currently focused on research questions related to "big data" and AI, bias and manipulation of data, and how technology shapes inequality.

A '''deed of change of name''' is a legal document—used in the United Kingdom, Ireland and some other countries with [[legal system]]s based on English [[common law]]—for an official [[name change]] by a person or family. It is one use of a [[deed poll]].

Some organisations, such as government departments issuing passports and driving licences, may not recognise a name change without documentation, such as a deed or [[statutory declaration]]. However, an official document is not a legal requirement for a valid name change&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/overview&lt;/ref&gt; according to common law.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1994/604/note/made&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal procedure==
===United Kingdom===
In [[England and Wales]], such a deed may be registered in the Central Office of the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales|High Court]]. Deeds so registered are advertised in the ''[[London Gazette]]''. A deed of name change on behalf of a minor must be approved by the [[Judiciary of England and Wales|Senior Master]] on behalf of the [[Master of the Rolls]] who will take into account the child's [[best interests]]. A deed poll can also be used to change a child's name, as long as everyone with parental responsibility for the child consents to it&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Change a child’s name|url=https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/change-a-childs-name|website=GOV.UK|accessdate=31 January 2015|quote=To change the name of a child aged under 16 (sometimes called a ‘minor’) you’ll need either: the agreement of everyone with parental responsibility [or] a court order}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the child does not object to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Changing your name|url=http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/england/relationships_e/relationships_birth_certificates_and_changing_your_name_e/changing_your_name.htm|website=AdviceGuide UK|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Registration of deeds is regulated by the ''Enrolment of Deeds (Change of Name) Regulations 1994'', [[Statutory Instrument|SI]] 1994/604&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legislation.data.gov.uk/cy/uksi/1994/604/made/data.htm?wrap=true |title=Enrolment of Deeds (Change of Name) Regulations 1994 |publisher=HM Government|website=legislation.data.gov.uk |date=4 July 2011 |accessdate=10 December 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; (as amended&lt;ref&gt;[https://deedpolloffice.com/change-name/enrolling/enrolment-regulations/1994 Enrolment of Deeds (Change of Name) Regulations 1994 SI 1994/604 (as amended)]&lt;/ref&gt;)
. Compared to some other European countries, for example Germany, a name change in the UK is easy and virtually unrestricted regarding choice.

Registration of a deed of change of name is not a legal requirement in the United Kingdom. A standard legal document, with stock wording, filled in by the person making the deed poll, and signed in presence of a [[witness]], carries sufficient legal [[authority]] to be recognised. The witness need not be a solicitor but can be anyone over the age of 18 independent of the person changing their name.

The procedure, requirements and law surrounding the issue in [[Northern Ireland]] are similar to those in England and Wales.
In England, Northern Ireland and Wales, a deed of change of name will not change the name on a birth certificate. For instance, when applying for a passport, both the certificate and the deed would need to be presented as documents of identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/614120/Guidance_Booklet_March_2017__ILB_44_03.17_.pdf |title=Applying for a Passport |publisher=HM Passport Office |accessdate=18 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Northern Ireland, for children between the ages of two and eighteen years, only one change of forename(s) and one change of surname may be recorded. In Scotland, it is also possible to record a change of name on the original birth register entry at the General Register Office.  However, only one change of forename and three changes of surname are permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files2/registration/rcn1.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614150953/http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files2/registration/rcn1.pdf |archivedate=14 June 2011 |title=Recording changes of forename(s) and surname(s) in Scotland |publisher=General Register Office for Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republic of Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], a deed poll of change of name ({{lang-ga|Athrú Ainm de réir Gníomhais Aonpháirtí}}) is obtainable from the Central Office of the [[Four Courts]], Dublin at a cost of €30. Like in the UK, there are very few restrictions on name changes. One is that foreign nationals must also obtain a change of name license from the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service. One of Ireland's most noted name changers was the politician [[Seán Dublin Bay Rockall Loftus|Seán Loftus]], who repeatedly added middle names referring to his political views so that they would appear on election ballot papers.

==History==
In ''re Parrott, Cox v Parrott'' [1946] Ch 183,&lt;ref&gt;[https://deedpolloffice.com/change-name/law/case-law/Re-Parrott-Cox-v-Parrott-1946-Ch-183 ''Re'' Parrott, Cox ''v'' Parrott &lt;nowiki&gt;[1946]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Ch 183]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harry Vaisey|Mr Justice Vaisey]] stated that he did not believe that a deed poll could be used to change a person's [[Christian name]] (first name) &amp;ndash; that could be done by only an [[Act of Parliament]]. Deeds that change a person's first name can be registered by the applicant in the Enrolment Books of the Senior Courts of England and Wales, which is located within the Royal Courts of Justice on Strand, London, and they are usually endorsed "Notwithstanding the decision of Mr Justice Vaisey in ''re Parrott, Cox v Parrott'', the applicant wishes the enrolment to proceed".

{{Refimprove|date=September 2007}}
The '''Eight Great Eminent Officials''' ({{zh|c=八大元老|p=Bā dà yuánlǎo}}), abbreviated as the '''Eight Elders''' ({{zh|c=八老|p=Bā lǎo}}), were a group of elderly members of the [[Communist Party of China]] who held substantial power during the 1980s and 1990s. In the English-speaking world, these men are often called '''The Eight Immortals''' as an [[allusion]] to the Taoist deities commonly known as the [[Eight Immortals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Joseph|first=William A.|title=Politics in China: An Introduction|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-533530-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kk80evDTZIYC&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in "strongman politics" ==
The politburo system was created by the Bolsheviks in 1917, when [[Vladimir Lenin]] established it to command and control the [[October Revolution]]. It was later adopted by the Chinese communists.  In both the early Chinese and Russian politburos, "strongman politics" played a large role in internal decision-making. Politburos under both [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Mao Zedong]] were later criticized for being dysfunctional and largely decorative, allowing the top leaders to dictate both party policy and the fate of the other leaders.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Under [[Deng Xiaoping]], important decisions were often made in Deng's home with a caucus of eight senior party cadres, called "Eight Elders". Deng ruled as paramount leader, although he never held the top title of the party or the state. However, Deng was able to remove three Party leaders with the aid of the Eight Elders. [[Hua Guofeng]] was gradually removed from Premier and Party Chairman between 1980 and 1981; [[Hu Yaobang]] was removed in 1987; and, [[Zhao Ziyang]] was removed in 1989.&lt;ref name=scmp20120420xiang&gt;Xiang, Lanxin (Apr 20, 2012). "Bo Xilai probe shows up China's outdated system of government". ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Descendants ==
Descendants of the Eight Elders who have benefited significantly from nepotism and cronyism constitute a group now known as "the [[Princelings]]" or the "Crown Prince Party". Its members, rising through party ranks, can easily overrule any opposition in their jurisdictions, even if they are assigned to a local administrative position. They are often seen to outrank other party officials and possess greater prestige due to their lineage.&lt;ref name=scmp20120420xiang/&gt; Bloomberg has reported on the extensive wealth accumulated by these descendants via their roles in various public and private companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Heirs of Mao’s Comrades Rise as New Capitalist Nobility|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-26/immortals-beget-china-capitalism-from-citic-to-godfather-of-golf.html|accessdate=December 28, 2012 | work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ethel Wood''' (16 January 1901 – 19 August 2011) was a [[Guernsey]] [[supercentenarian]]. At the age of 110, Wood was the ninth-oldest verified person who died in the United Kingdom following the death of 112-year-old [[Margaret Fish]] on 12 March 2011. Wood was not born in the United Kingdom, since Guernsey is a [[Crown dependencies|crown-dependency]], and legally never part of the Kingdom of England or the the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmjust/56/5604.htm |title=Crown Dependencies – Justice Committee |website=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] |date=30 March 2010 |accessdate=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
.

==Biography==

Ethel Wood was born in [[Saint Sampson, Guernsey]]. She was one of five children born to William and Lily Wood. Wood trained as a teacher in London prior to the [[German occupation of the Channel Islands|German occupation of Guernsey]]. Like her siblings, she never married or had children.

She moved to Essex in the 1990s to care for her younger sister, Edith. Wood lived in her own home until breaking her leg during a fall a month before her 110th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/local/clacton/8797400.Ethel__aged_110__says___I_don_t_feel_any_different_/ "Ethel, aged 110, says: "I don't feel any different""], ''Daily Gazette'' ([[Clacton-on-Sea|Clacton]], Frinton and Walton), 18 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eadt.co.uk/news/essex-amazing-ethel-celebrates-her-110th-birthday-1-776944|title=Essex: ‘Amazing’ Ethel celebrates her 110th birthday|first=By Chris|last=Harris|publisher=|accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethel died suddenly on 19 August 2011, aged 110 years, 215 days in England. If she had lived until December of that year, she would have surpassed the only other supercententenarian from Guernsey, [[Margaret Ann Neve]] (1792–1903).

The '''flags of the Dutch royal family''' are a set of flags used to identify a member of the royal family. The current system of flags for the Dutch monarch, princes, and princesses was introduced in 1908.

== Background ==
The current system of personal flags for the monarch and other members of the royal family was introduced in 1908. In 1907, minor modifications were introduced to the Dutch coat of arms; likewise, a new flag for the Dutch monarch was introduced the following year. These flags are designed by the High Council of Nobility (who are also responsible for heraldry of the royal family) and are granted by royal decree. Like their coats of arms, these flags are usually shared among siblings.

The flags follow a similar pattern and, although not [[banner of arms|banners of arms]], are heavily influenced by heraldry. Flags of those born into the royal family feature a Nassau-blue cross on an orange field, while the colours are reversed for those who marry into the family. Males have near-square flags while those of females are swallowtailed. Elements of an individual's family coat of arms are also incorporated into the flags.

== Use ==
The flags are used to mark the presence of an individual in certain buildings, when on vehicles (e.g. a car or ship), or in an army unit. The flag of the monarch is flown above [[Huis ten Bosch Palace]] in [[The Hague]] (the king's private residence) and above [[Noordeinde Palace]] in The Hague (the king's official residence) when the monarch is in the Netherlands, but not necessarily when he is actually resident. Besides these two residences, the royal standard is flown above other palaces, castles or estates where and when the King is actually staying.

The flags are never flown at half-mast; during a period of mourning, a black [[pennon]] is affixed to the flagpole flying the flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Personal flags|url=https://www.royal-house.nl/topics/flags/personal-flags|website=www.royal-house.nl|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Royal standard ==
The '''royal flag''' ({{lang-nl|koninklijke vlag}}), or the '''royal standard''' of the [[Netherlands]], is the official flag of the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Dutch monarch]]. This flag is a non-personal distinctive flag and is not changed from reign to reign. The current flag, introduced in 1908, is a square [[orange (colour)|orange]] flag, divided in four quarters by a nassau-blue [[cross]]. These colours refer to the principality of [[Principality of Orange|Orange]] (in [[France]]) and the principality of [[Duchy of Nassau|Nassau]] (in [[Germany]]) from which the present royal family originates. 

In the centre of the flag is the lesser [[Coat of arms of the Netherlands|coat of arms of the Kingdom]] (which originates as a composite of features taken from the arms of the [[house of Nassau]] and the [[Dutch Republic Lion|arms of the Dutch republic]]) surmounted by a [[Crown (headgear)|royal crown]] and surrounded by the insignia of the Grand Cross of the [[Military William Order]]. Each quarter shows a bugle-horn which originates in arms of the principality of Orange.

Image:Arms of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.svg| [[Coat of arms of the Netherlands|Netherlands]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Upon the accession of King [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|Willem-Alexander]] in 2013, the monarch's flag was slightly modified: Instead of a rosette, a bow is placed in the ribbon of the Military William Order. Furthermore, the tassels on the horns now both hang down. The adjustments were applied on 30 April 2013 immediately after Willem-Alexander taking office.

==Princes==
The flag of a Dutch prince is rectangular in shape and of proportions 5:6. Flags of princes born into the royal family consist of a Nassau-blue cross on an orange field. 

Instead of the hunting horn of Orange in the upper right and the lower left quarters found in the monarch's flag, these are replaced with figures obtained from the coat of arms of the family of the prince's parent who married into the royal family. 

Unlike the monarch's flag, the coat of arms of the kingdom is not surrounded by the insignia of the Great Cross of the Military Order of Guillaume, but is placed within an orange circle which replaces the center of the cross.

==Princesses==
The flag of a Dutch princess is [[Swallowtail (flag)|swallowtail]]ed in shape and of proportions 5:6. Flags of princesses born into the royal family consist of a Nassau-blue cross on an orange field while the flags of princesses by marriage are reversed. 

Unlike the flags for princes, the right side of the flag is devoid of the hunting horn of Orange and personal figure. However, the left portion of a princesse's flag contains the usual hunting horn of Orange and personal figure (obtained from the coat of arms of the family of the princess's parent who married into the royal family) in the upper and lower left quarters of the flag respectively.

Unlike the monarch's flag, the coat of arms of the kingdom is not surrounded by the insignia of the Great Cross of the Military Order of Guillaume, but is placed either within an orange circle which replaces the center of a blue cross, or at the centre of an orange cross.

==Consorts==
In general, the standard of a prince consort of the Netherlands is a rectangular flag with proportions 5:6 with the colours of the royal standard (i.e. the orange field and blue cross) reversed. The upper left and lower right quarters bear the lion from the Dutch coat of arms (holding arrows in one hand and brandishing a sword on the other) while the other two quarters have a personal figure taken from their personal coat of arms.

In general, the standard of a queen consort, or the wife of a prince of the Netherlands, is a flag in the form of a swallow tail. The two right quarters are empty, the upper left corner bears the orange horn taken from the arms of the Principality of Orange and the lower left quarter has a personal figure, taken from their personal coat of arms.

In both cases, the coat of arms of the kingdom is at the center of the cross.

The '''Founding Fathers of the United States''' led the [[American Revolution]] against the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. Most were descendants of colonists settled in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] in [[North America]].

Historian [[Richard B. Morris]] in 1973 identified the following seven figures as the key Founding Fathers: [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[John Adams]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[John Jay]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]], and [[George Washington]].&lt;ref name="MorrisSeven"&gt;Richard B. Morris, ''Seven Who Shaped Our Destiny: The Founding Fathers as Revolutionaries'' (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1973).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kettler, Sarah|title=The Founding Fathers: Who Were They Really?|url=http://www.biography.com/news/founding-fathers-quotes-facts|publisher=Biography|accessdate= April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams, Jefferson, and Franklin were members of the [[Committee of Five]] that drafted the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].  Hamilton, Madison, and Jay were authors of ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', advocating ratification of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]].  The constitutions drafted by Jay and Adams for their respective states of [[New York Constitution|New York (1777)]] and [[Constitution of Massachusetts|Massachusetts (1780)]] were heavily relied upon when creating language for the US Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About America, The Constitution of the United States|publisher=World Book|access-date=September 17, 2017|url=https://photos.state.gov/libraries/amgov/30145/publications-english/constitution.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jay, Adams and Franklin negotiated the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] that would end the [[American Revolutionary War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=PBS NewsHour|title=Forgotten Founding Father|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/forgotten-founding-father/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Washington was [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[Continental Army]] and was President of the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]]. All held additional important roles in the early government of the United States, with Washington, Adams, Jefferson, and Madison serving as President. Jay was the nation's first Chief Justice, Hamilton was the first [[Secretary of the Treasury]], and Franklin was America's most senior diplomat, and later the governmental leader of Pennsylvania.

The term Founding Fathers is sometimes used to refer to [[Signing of the United States Declaration of Independence|the Signers]] of the embossed version of the Declaration of Independence in 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Signers of the Declaration|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/declaration|publisher=National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior|access-date=April 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Signers'' should not be confused with the term ''Framers''; the Framers are defined by the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] as those 55 individuals who were appointed to be delegates to the 1787 [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] and took part in drafting the proposed Constitution of the United States. Of the 55 Framers, only 39 were signers of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Archives|title=Meet the Framers of the Constitution|url=https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/founding-fathers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=US Constitution Online|title=The Framers|url=https://www.usconstitution.net/constframe.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two further groupings of Founding Fathers include: 1) those who signed the [[Continental Association]], a trade ban and one of the [[American colonists|colonists']] first collective volleys protesting British control and the [[Intolerable Acts]] in 1774&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Carpenter's Hall |author=Carl G. Karsch |title=The First Continental Congress: A Dangerous Journey Begins |access-date=April 10, 2017 |url=http://www.ushistory.org/carpentershall/history/congress.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118024728/http://www.ushistory.org/carpentershall/history/congress.htm |archivedate=January 18, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or 2) those who signed the [[Articles of Confederation]], the first U.S. constitutional document.&lt;ref&gt;Stanfield, Jack.  ''America's Founding Fathers: Who Are They? Thumbnail Sketches of 164 Patriots'' (Universal-Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "Founding Fathers" is a 20th-century appellation, coined by [[Warren G. Harding]] in 1916. Prior to, and during the 19th century, they were referred to as simply the "Fathers". The term has  been used to describe the founders and first settlers of the original royal colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Parham|first1=C.

==Background==
[[File:Albany Congress.jpeg|thumb|upright|The [[Albany Congress]] of 1754 was a conference attended by seven colonies, which presaged later efforts at cooperation. The [[Stamp Act Congress]] of 1765 included representatives from nine colonies.]]

The [[First Continental Congress]] met briefly in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1774, consisting of fifty-six delegates from twelve of the [[thirteen colonies]] (not including [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]]) that became the United States of America. Among them was [[George Washington]], who would soon be drawn out of military retirement to command the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Also in attendance was [[Patrick Henry]], and [[John Adams]], who like all delegates were elected by their respective colonial assemblies. Other delegates included [[Samuel Adams]] from Massachusetts, [[John Dickinson (politician)|John Dickinson]] from Pennsylvania and New York's [[John Jay]]. This congress in addition to formulating appeals to the British crown, established the [[Continental Association]] to administer boycott actions against Britain.

When the [[Second Continental Congress]] convened on May 10, 1775, it essentially reconstituted the First Congress. Many of the same 56 delegates who attended the first meeting participated in the second.&lt;ref&gt;Burnett, ''Continental Congress'', 64–67.&lt;/ref&gt; New arrivals included [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] of Pennsylvania, [[John Hancock]] of Massachusetts, and [[John Witherspoon]] of New Jersey. Hancock was elected Congress President two weeks into the session when [[Peyton Randolph]] was recalled to Virginia to preside over the [[House of Burgesses]]. [[Thomas Jefferson]] replaced Randolph in the Virginia congressional delegation.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, ''Baron of Beacon Hill'', 189.&lt;/ref&gt; The second Congress adopted the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. Witherspoon was the only active clergyman to sign the Declaration. He also signed the [[Articles of Confederation]] and attended the New Jersey (1787) convention that ratified the Federal Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Signers of the Declaration|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/declaration/bio54.htm|publisher=National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior|accessdate=April 24, 2014|page=Biography #54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newly founded country of the United States had to create a new government to replace the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]]. The U.S. adopted the Articles of Confederation, a declaration that established a national government with a one-house legislature. Its ratification by all thirteen colonies gave the second Congress a new name: the [[Congress of the Confederation]], which met from 1781 to 1789.&lt;ref name="Confederation Congress, Ohio Historical Society"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=2327 |title=Confederation Congress |publisher=Ohio Historical Society |accessdate=October 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] took place during the summer of 1787, in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=Jillson2009&gt;{{cite book|title=American Government: Political Development and Institutional Change|author=Calvin C. Jillson|edition=5th|publisher=Taylor &amp;amp; Francis|year=2009|isbn=978-0-203-88702-8|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Convention was called to revise the Articles of Confederation, the intention from the outset for some including [[James Madison]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]] was to create a new frame of government rather than amending the existing one. The delegates elected George Washington to preside over the Convention. The result of the Convention was the [[United States Constitution]] and the replacement of the Continental Congress with the [[United States Congress]].

The Founding Fathers represented a cross-section of 18th-century U.S. leadership. According to a study of the biographies by Caroline Robbins: 
:The  Signers came for the most part from an educated elite, were residents of  older settlements, and belonged with a few exceptions to a moderately  well-to-do class representing only a fraction of the population. Native  or born overseas, they were of British stock and of the Protestant faith.&lt;ref&gt;&gt;Caroline Robbins,  "Decision in '76: Reflections on the 56 Signers." ''Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society''. Vol. 89  pp 72-87, quote  at p 86&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref See also Richard D. Brown, "The Founding Fathers of 1776 and 1787: A collective view." The William and Mary Quarterly: A Magazine of Early American History (1976) 33#3 : 465-480.  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1921543 online]

Almost all of them were leaders in their communities. Many were also prominent in national affairs. Virtually every one had taken part in the [[American Revolution]]; at least 29 had served in the [[Continental Army]], most of them in positions of command. Scholars have examined the collective biography of them as well as the signers of the Declaration and the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;See Brown (19764); Martin (19739); "Data on the Framers of the Constitution," at [http://www.usconstitution.net/constframedata.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Many of the Founding Fathers attended or held degrees from the [[colonial colleges]], most notably [[Columbia University|Columbia]] known at the time as "King's College", [[Princeton University|Princeton]] originally known as "The College of New Jersey", [[Harvard|Harvard College]], the [[College of William and Mary]], [[Yale|Yale College]] and [[University of Pennsylvania]]. Some had previously been home schooled or obtained early instruction from private tutors or academies.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1976); Harris (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; Others had studied abroad. Ironically, Benjamin Franklin who had little formal education himself would ultimately establish the [[University of Pennsylvania|College of Philadelphia]] based on European models (1740); "Penn" would have the first medical school (1765) in the thirteen colonies where another Founder, [[Benjamin Rush]] would eventually teach.

With a limited number of professional schools established in the U.S., Founders also sought advanced degrees from traditional institutions in England and Scotland such as the [[University of Edinburgh]], the [[University of St. Andrews]], and the [[University of Glasgow]].

====Colonial colleges attended====
* College of William and Mary: Thomas Jefferson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Alma Maters of Our Founding Fathers|access-date=April 7, 2017|url=https://www.universitylanguage.com/blog/02/the-alma-maters-of-our-founding-fathers/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cite web|title=The University of Glasgow Story James Wilson|access-date=March 26, 2018|url=http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH24021&amp;type=P/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Edinburgh]] though he never received a degree.

====Advanced degrees and apprenticeships====
=====Doctors of Medicine=====
* University of Edinburgh: Rush &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Penn University Archives and Records Center|title=Benjamin Rush (1746 - 1813) access-date=April 9, 2017|url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/people/1700s/rush_benj.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* University of Utrecht, Netherlands: Williamson

=====[[Theology]]=====
* University of Edinburgh: Witherspoon (attended, no degree)
* University of St. Andrews: Witherspoon (honorary doctorate)

=====Legal apprenticeships=====

Several like John Jay, James Wilson, [[John Williams (Continental Congress)|John Williams]] and [[George Wythe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George Wythe|publisher=Colonial Williamsburg|access-date=April 9, 2017|url=https://www.history.org/almanack/people/bios/biowythe.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; were trained as lawyers through apprenticeships in the colonies while a few trained at the [[Inns of Court]] in London.

====Self-taught or little formal education====
Franklin, Washington, [[John Williams (Continental Congress)|John Williams]] and [[Henry Wisner]] had little formal education and were largely [[Autodidacticism|self-taught]] or learned through [[apprenticeship]].

===Demographics===
The great majority were born in the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. But at least nine were born outside:
* [[England]]: Robert Morris, Button Gwinnett
* [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]]: Butler, Fitzsimons, McHenry, and Paterson
* [[Nevis|West Indies]]: Hamilton
* [[Scotland]]: Wilson and Witherspoon

Many of them had moved from one state to another. Eighteen had already lived, studied or worked in more than one state or colony: Baldwin, Bassett, Bedford, Davie, Dickinson, Few, Franklin, Ingersoll, Hamilton, Livingston, Alexander Martin, Luther Martin, Mercer, Gouverneur Morris, Robert Morris, Read, Sherman, and Williamson.

Several others had studied or traveled abroad.

===Occupations===
The Founding Fathers practiced a wide range of [[Occupational prestige|high and middle-status occupations]], and many pursued more than one career simultaneously. They did not differ dramatically from the [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]], except they were generally younger and less senior in their professions.&lt;ref&gt;Greene (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;
* As many as thirty-five including Adams, Hamilton and Jay were trained as lawyers though not all of them practiced law. Some had also been local judges.&lt;ref name="Brown 1976"&gt;Brown (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Washington trained as a land surveyor before he became commander of a small militia
* At the time of the convention, 13 men were merchants: Blount, Broom, Clymer, Dayton, Fitzsimons, Shields, Gilman, Gorham, Langdon, Robert Morris, Pierce, Sherman, and Wilson.
* Broom and Few were small farmers.
* Three had retired from active economic endeavors: Franklin, McHenry, and Mifflin.
* Franklin and Williamson were scientists, in addition to their other activities.
* McClurg, McHenry, Rush, and Williamson were physicians
* Johnson and Witherspoon were college presidents.

===Finances===

Historian [[Caroline Robbins]] in 1977 examined the status of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence and concluded:
:There were indeed disparities of wealth, earned or inherited: some Signers were rich, others had about enough to enable them to attend Congress....The majority of revolutionaries were from  moderately well-to-do or average income brackets. Twice as many Loyalists belonged to the wealthiest echelon. But some Signers were rich; few, indigent.... The Signers were elected not for wealth or rank so much as because of the evidence they had already evinced of willingness for public service.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Robbins, "Decision in '76: Reflections on the 56 Signers" ''Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society'' Vol. 89 (1977), pp. 72-87 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25080810 online] quoting page 83.&lt;/ref&gt; A few of them were wealthy or had financial resources that ranged from good to excellent, but there are other founders who were less than wealthy. On the whole they were less wealthy than the Loyalists.&lt;ref&gt;Greene (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Seven were major land speculators: Blount, Dayton, Fitzsimmons, Gorham, Robert Morris, Washington, and Wilson.
* Eleven speculated in securities on a large scale: Bedford, Blair, Clymer, Dayton, Fitzsimons, Franklin, King, Langdon, Robert Morris, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, and Sherman.
* Many derived income from [[Plantations in the American South|plantations]] or large farms which they owned or managed, which relied upon the labor of enslaved men and women particularly in the southern colonies: Bassett, Blair, Blount, Davie,&lt;ref name="William R. Davie 1957"&gt;William R. Davie, Blackwell P. Robinson. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson, Butler, Carroll, Jefferson, Jenifer, Madison, Mason, Charles Pinckney, [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]], Rutledge, Spaight, and Washington.
* Eight of the men received a substantial part of their income from public office: Baldwin, Blair, Brearly, Gilman, Livingston, Madison, and Rutledge.

===Prior political experience===
Several of the Founding Fathers had extensive national, state, local and foreign political experience prior to the adoption of the Constitution in 1787. Some had been diplomats. Several had been members of the [[Continental Congress]] or elected President of that body.
* [[Benjamin Franklin]] began his political career as a city councilman and then Justice of the Peace in Philadelphia. He was next elected to the [[Pennsylvania Assembly]] and was sent by them to London as a colonial agent which helped hone his diplomatic skills.
* [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]], [[John Adams|Adams]], [[John Jay|Jay]] and [[Benjamin Franklin|Franklin]] all acquired significant political experience as ministers to countries in Europe.
* [[John Adams]] and [[John Jay]] drafted the Constitutions of their respective states, Massachusetts and New York, and successfully navigated them through to adoption.
* Jay, [[Thomas Mifflin]] and [[Nathaniel Gorham]] had served as [[President of the Continental Congress]].
* [[Gouverneur Morris]] had been a member of the [[New York Provincial Congress]].
* [[John Dickinson]], Franklin, Langdon, and Rutledge had been governors or presidents of their states.
* [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] had been a member of the [[Pennsylvania Assembly]] and President of Pennsylvania's [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)]]. He was also a member of the [[Committee of Secret Correspondence]].
* [[Roger Sherman]] had served in the [[Connecticut House of Representatives]].
* [[Elbridge Gerry]] was a member of the [[Massachusetts Provincial Congress]].
* [[Daniel Carroll|Carroll]] served in the [[Maryland Senate]].
* [[George Wythe|Wythe]]'s first exposure to politics was as a member of Virginia's [[House of Burgesses]].
* [[George Read (U.S. statesman)|Read]]'s entry into the political arena was as a commissioner of the town of Charlestown, Maryland.
* [[George Clymer|Clymer]] was a member of the Philadelphia Committee of Safety and the Continental Congress.
* [[James Wilson|Wilson]]'s time as a member of the Continental Congress in 1776 was his introduction to colonial politics.

Nearly all of the 55 Constitutional Convention delegates had some experience in colonial and state government, and the majority had held county and local offices.&lt;ref&gt;Martin (1973); Greene (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; Those who lacked national congressional experience were [[Richard Bassett (politician)|Bassett]], [[John Blair Jr.|Blair]], [[David Brearly|Brearly]], [[Jacob Broom|Broom]], [[William Richardson Davie|Davie]], [[Jonathan Dayton|Dayton]], [[Alexander Martin]], [[Luther Martin]], [[George Mason|Mason]], [[James McClurg|McClurg]], [[William Paterson (judge)|Paterson]], [[Charles Pinckney (governor)|Charles Pinckney]], [[Caleb Strong|Strong]], and [[Robert Yates (politician)|Yates]].

===Religion===
Franklin T. Lambert (2003) has examined the religious affiliations and beliefs of some of the Founders. Of the 55 delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention, 28 were [[Anglicans]] (in the [[Church of England]]; or [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]], after the [[American Revolutionary War]] was won), 21 were [[Protestantism|Protestants]], and two were [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] (D. Carroll, and Fitzsimons).&lt;ref name="Lambert2003"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Founding Fathers and the Place of Religion in America |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ |last=Lambert |first=Franklin T. |authorlink=Franklin T. Lambert |date=2003 |publication-date=2006 |isbn=978-0691126029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the Protestant delegates to the Constitutional Convention, eight were [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]], seven were [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]], two were [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], two were [[Dutch Reformed Church|Dutch Reformed]], and two were [[Methodism|Methodists]].&lt;ref name="Lambert2003" /&gt;

A few prominent Founding Fathers were [[Anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] Christians such as Thomas Jefferson,&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Alexander von Humboldt, December 6, 1813 "History, I believe, furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people maintaining a free civil government,"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Horatio G. Spafford, March 17, 1814 "In every country and in every age, the priest has been hostile to liberty. He is always in alliance with the despot, abetting his abuses in return for protection to his own."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecollege.edu/about-us/veritas-aeterna/383-religion-of-jefferson The Religion of Thomas Jefferson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123151450/http://ecollege.edu/about-us/veritas-aeterna/383-religion-of-jefferson |date=November 23, 2011 }} Retrieved July 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; who constructed the ''[[Jefferson Bible]]'', and Benjamin Franklin.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in The New England Currant (July 23, 1722), "Silence Dogood, No. 9; ''Corruptio optimi est pessima''." "And it is a sad Observation, that when the People too late see their Error, yet the Clergy still persist in their Encomiums on the Hypocrite; and when he happens to die for the Good of his Country, without leaving behind him the Memory of one good Action, he shall be sure to have his Funeral Sermon stuff'd with Pious Expressions which he dropt at such a Time, and at such a Place, and on such an Occasion; than which nothing can be more prejudicial to the Interest of Religion, nor indeed to the Memory of the Person deceas'd. The Reason of this Blindness in the Clergy is, because they are honourably supported (as they ought to be) by their People, and see nor feel nothing of the Oppression which is obvious and burdensome to every one else."&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Gregg L. Frazer argues that the leading Founders (John Adams, Jefferson, Franklin, Wilson, Morris, Madison, Hamilton, and Washington) were neither Christians nor Deists, but rather supporters of a hybrid "[[theistic rationalism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Religious Beliefs of America's Founders: Reason, Revelation, and Revolution |isbn=978-0700620210 |first=Gregg L. |last=Frazer |publisher=University Press of Kansas |date=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Founders deliberately avoided public discussion of their faith. Historian [[David L. Holmes]] uses evidence gleaned from letters, government documents, and second- hand accounts to identify their religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;[[David L. Holmes]] in ''[[The Faiths of the Founding Fathers]]'' (Oxford University Press, 2006) &lt;/ref&gt;

===Ownership of slaves and position on slavery===
[[File:GW-painting.jpg|thumb |upright=0.8 |right |Portrait of [[George Washington]] and his valet slave [[William Lee (valet)|William Lee]]]]
{{See also|George Washington and slavery|Thomas Jefferson and slavery}}
The founding fathers were not unified on the issue of slavery. In her study of [[Thomas Jefferson]], historian Annette Gordon-Reed discusses this topic, "Others of the founders held slaves, but no other founder drafted the charter for freedom, "&lt;ref name="Annette Gordon-Reed 2000 pp. 171-182"&gt;Annette Gordon-Reed, ''Engaging Jefferson: Blacks and the Founding Father'', The William and Mary Quarterly, Vol. 57, No. 1 (Jan., 2000), pp. 171-182&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Jefferson, [[George Washington]], [[John Jay]] and many other of the Founding Fathers practiced slavery but were also conflicted by the institution which many saw as immoral and politically divisive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Founders and Slavery: John Jay Saves the Day|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2011/07/founders-and-slavery |publisher=The Economist|accessdate= April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, many founders such as [[Samuel Adams]] and [[John Adams]] were against slavery their entire lives.  [[Benjamin Rush]] wrote a pamphlet in 1773 which harshly condemned slavery and beseeched the colonists to petition the king and put an end to the British [[African Company of Merchants]] which kept slavery and the slave trade going.

Franklin, though he was a key founder of the [[Pennsylvania Abolition Society]]&lt;ref name=Wright_p125&gt;{{cite book |first=William D. |last=Wright |title=Critical Reflections on Black History |year=2002 |page=125|publisher=Praeger Publishers |location=[[Westport, Connecticut|West Port]], [[Connecticut]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally owned slaves whom he later [[manumit]]ted. While serving in the Rhode Island Assembly, [[Stephen_Hopkins_(politician)|Stephen Hopkins]] introduced one of the earliest anti-slavery laws in the colonies, and [[John Jay]] would try unsuccessfully to abolish slavery as early as 1777 in the State of New York.&lt;ref&gt;The Selected Papers of John Jay, Columbia University, http://www.columbia.edu/cu/libraries/inside/dev/jay/JaySlavery.html&lt;/ref&gt; He nonetheless founded the [[New York Manumission Society]] in 1785, for which Hamilton became an officer. They and other members of the Society founded the [[African Free School]] in New York City, to educate the children of free blacks and slaves. When Jay was governor of New York in 1798, he helped secure--an signed into law an abolition law; fully ending forced labor as of 1827. He freed his own slaves in 1798. [[Alexander Hamilton]] opposed slavery, as his experiences in life left him very familiar with slavery and its effect on slaves and on slaveholders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.alexanderhamiltonexhibition.org/about/teachers.html |last=Horton |first=James O. |year=2004 |title=Alexander Hamilton: Slavery and Race in a Revolutionary Generation |journal=New York Journal of American History |issue=3 |access-date=October 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he did negotiate slave transactions for his wife's family, the [[Schuyler family|Schuylers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Magness, Phillip |title=Alexander Hamilton's Exaggerated Abolitionism |access-date=April 6, 2017 |url=http://historynewsnetwork.org/blog/153639}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Adams, Samuel Adams, and Thomas Paine never owned slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=The Founding Fathers and Slavery|access-date=April 9, 2017|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Founding-Fathers-and-Slavery-1269536}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Slavery in the United States|Slaves and slavery]] are mentioned only indirectly in the 1787 Constitution.  For example, [[Three-Fifths Compromise|Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3]] prescribes that "three fifths of all other Persons" are to be counted for the apportionment of seats in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and direct taxes.  Additionally, in [[Fugitive Slave Clause|Article 4, Section 2, Clause 3]], slaves are referred to as "persons held in service or labor".&lt;ref name=Wright_p125/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freehling_TAHR_p87/&gt; The Founding Fathers, however, did make important efforts to contain slavery. Many Northern states had adopted legislation to end or significantly reduce slavery during and after the American Revolution.&lt;ref name=Freehling_TAHR_p87&gt;{{cite journal |last=Freehling |first=William W. |title=The Founding Fathers and Slavery |date=February 1972 |journal=The American Historical Review |volume=77 |pages=81–93 |number=1 |doi=10.2307/1856595|jstor=1856595 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1782 [[Virginia]] passed a [[manumission]] law that allowed slave owners to free their slaves by will or deed.&lt;ref name=Cambridge_p278&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of Law in America| year=2008 |page=278}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, thousands of slaves were manumitted in Virginia.&lt;ref name=Cambridge_p278/&gt; Thomas Jefferson, in 1784, proposed to ban slavery in all the Western Territories, which failed to pass Congress by one vote.&lt;ref name=Freehling_TAHR_p87/&gt; Partially following Jefferson's plan, Congress did ban slavery in the [[Northwest Ordinance of 1787]], for lands north of the [[Ohio River]].&lt;ref name=Freehling_TAHR_p87/&gt;

The [[Atlantic slave trade|international slave trade]] was banned in all states except [[South Carolina]], by 1800. Finally in 1807, President Jefferson called for and signed into law a Federally-enforced ban on the international slave trade throughout the U.S. and its territories. It became a federal crime to import or export a slave.&lt;ref name=Freehling_TAHR_p88&gt;{{cite journal |last=Freehling |first=William W. |title=The Founding Fathers and Slavery |date=February 1972 |journal=The American Historical Review |volume=77 |pages=81–93 |number=1 |doi=10.2307/1856595|jstor=1856595 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the domestic [[slave trade]] was allowed, for expansion, or for diffusion of slavery into the [[Louisiana Territory]].&lt;ref name=Freehling_TAHR_p85&gt;{{cite journal |last=Freehling |first=William W. |title=The Founding Fathers and Slavery |date=February 1972 |journal=The American Historical Review |volume=77 |pages=81–93 |number=1 |doi=10.2307/1856595|jstor=1856595 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attendance at conventions===
In the winter and spring of 1786–1787, twelve of the thirteen states chose a total of 74 delegates to attend the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. Nineteen delegates chose not to accept election or attend the debates; for example, [[Patrick Henry]] of Virginia thought that state politics were far more interesting and important than national politics, though during the ratification controversy of 1787–1788 he claimed, "I smelled a rat." Rhode Island did not send delegates because of its politicians' suspicions of the Convention delegates' motivations. As the colony was founded by [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] as a sanctuary for [[Baptist]]s, Rhode Island's absence at the Convention in part explains the absence of Baptist affiliation among those who did attend. Of the 55 who did attend at some point, no more than 38 delegates showed up at one time.&lt;ref&gt;See the discussion of the Convention in Clinton L. Rossiter, ''1787: The Grand Convention'' (New York: Macmillan, 1966; reprint ed., with new foreword by Richard B. Morris, New York: W. W. Norton, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spouses and children===
Only four (Baldwin, Gilman, Jenifer, and Alexander Martin) were lifelong bachelors. Many of their spouses, like [[Eliza Schuyler Hamilton]], [[Martha Washington]], [[Abigail Adams]], Sarah Livingston Jay, [[Dolley Madison]], Mary White Morris and Catherine Alexander Duer were strong women who made significant contributions of their own to the fight for liberty.&lt;ref name="Griswold, Rufus 1855"&gt;Griswold, Rufus (1855), ''The Republican Court, or, American Society in the Days of Washington'', D. Appleton &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sherman fathered the largest family: 15 children by two wives. At least nine (Bassett, Brearly, Johnson, Mason, Paterson, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, Sherman, Wilson, and Wythe) married more than once. George Washington, "The Father of our Country,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=George Washington's Mount Vernon|title=Father of His Country|access-date=April 6, 2017|url=http://www.mountvernon.org/digital-encyclopedia/article/father-of-his-country/}}&lt;/ref&gt; had no biological descendants.

===Charters of freedom and historical documents of the United States===
The [[National Archives and Records Administration]] also known as NARA, defines U.S. Founding Documents, or [[Charters of Freedom]], as the Declaration of Independence (1776), The Constitution (1787) and the Bill of Rights (1791). These original instruments which represent the philosophy of the United States are housed in Washington, D.C. in the NARA Rotunda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Archives|title=America's Founding Documents|access-date=April 6, 2017|url=https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Library of Congress]] further identifies the Articles of Confederation, also preserved at NARA, as a primary U.S. document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher= Library of Congress|title=Articles of Confederation|access-date=April 10, 2017|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/articles.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Articles of Confederation served as the first constitution of the United States until its replacement by the present Constitution on March 4, 1789.

===Post-constitution life===
Subsequent events in the lives of the Founding Fathers after the adoption of the Constitution were characterized by success or failure, reflecting the abilities of these men as well as the vagaries of fate.&lt;ref&gt;Martin (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; Washington, Adams, Jefferson and Madison served in highest U.S. office of President. Jay would be appointed as Chief Justice of the United States and later elected to two terms as Governor of New York.

Seven (Fitzsimons, Gorham, Luther Martin, Mifflin, Robert Morris, Pierce, and Wilson) suffered serious financial reversals that left them in or near bankruptcy. Robert Morris spent three of the last years of his life imprisoned following bad land deals.&lt;ref name="Griswold, Rufus 1855"/&gt;
Two, Blount and Dayton, were involved in possibly treasonous activities. Yet, as they had done before the convention, most of the group continued to render public service, particularly to the new government they had helped to create.

===Youth and longevity===
[[File:Death Age-Founding Fathers.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.6|Death age of the Founding Fathers]]

Many of the Founding Fathers were under 40 years old at the time of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776: [[Alexander Hamilton]] was 21, [[Aaron Burr]] was 20, [[Gouverneur Morris]] was 24. The oldest were Benjamin Franklin, 70, and [[Samuel Whittemore]], 81.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrlik, Todd|title=How Old Were the Leaders of the American Revolution on July 4, 1776?|url= http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/08/how_old_were_the_founding_father_the_leaders_of_the_american_revolution.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secretary [[Charles Thomson]] lived to the age of 94. Johnson died at 92. John Adams lived to the age of 90. A few – Franklin, Jay, Jefferson, Madison, [[Hugh Williamson]], and [[George Wythe]] – lived into their eighties. Approximately 16 died in their seventies, 21 in their sixties, 8 in their fifties, and 5 in their forties. Three ([[Burr-Hamilton duel|Alexander Hamilton]], [[Richard Dobbs Spaight]] and [[Button Gwinnett]]) were killed in [[duel]]s.

Friends and political adversaries John Adams and Thomas Jefferson both died on the same day – July 4, 1826.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=History|title=Thomas Jefferson and John Adams Die|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/thomas-jefferson-and-john-adams-die}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last remaining founders, also called the "[[Last of the Romans]]", lived well into the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Elizabeth Fox-Genovese|author2=Eugene D. Genovese|title=The Mind of the Master Class: History and Faith in the Southern Slaveholders' Worldview|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iaSeHEByLnUC&amp;pg=PA278|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=278|isbn=9780521850650}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutions formed by Founders===
Several Founding Fathers were instrumental in establishing schools and societal institutions that still exist today:
* Franklin founded the University of Pennsylvania, while Jefferson founded the [[University of Virginia]].
* Rush founded Dickinson College and Franklin College, (today [[Franklin and Marshall]]) as well as the [[College of Physicians of Philadelphia]], the oldest medical society in America.
* Hamilton founded the ''[[New York Post]]'', as well as the [[United States Coast Guard]].
* [[Henry Knox|Knox]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Society of the Cincinnati|title=The Founding of the Society, 1783–1784|access-date=April 9, 2017|url=http://www.societyofthecincinnati.org/about/history/founding}}&lt;/ref&gt; helped found the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] in 1783; the society was predicated on service as an officer in the Revolutionary War and heredity. Members included Washington, Hamilton and Burr. Other Founders like Sam Adams, John Adams, Franklin and Jay criticized the formation of what they considered to be an elitist body and threat to the Constitution. Franklin would later accept an honorary membership though Jay declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History:The Society of the Cincinnati in the State of Connecticut|url=http://theconnecticutsociety.org/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scholarship on the Founders===
Articles and books by twenty-first century historians combined with the digitization of primary sources like handwritten letters continue to contribute to an encyclopedic body of knowledge about the Founding Fathers.

====Historians who focus on the Founding Fathers====
'''[[Ron Chernow]]''' won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his biography of George Washington. His bestselling book about Alexander Hamilton inspired the blockbuster [[Hamilton (musical)|musical of the same name]].

'''[[Joseph J. Ellis]]''' – According to Ellis, the concept of the Founding Fathers of the U.S. emerged in the 1820s as the last survivors died out. Ellis says "the founders", or "the fathers", comprised an aggregate of semi-sacred figures whose particular accomplishments and singular achievements were decidedly less important than their sheer presence as a powerful but faceless symbol of past greatness. For the generation of national leaders coming of age in the 1820s and 1830s – men like [[Andrew Jackson]], [[Henry Clay]], [[Daniel Webster]], and [[John C. Calhoun]] – "the founders" represented a heroic but anonymous abstraction whose long shadow fell across all followers and whose legendary accomplishments defied comparison.

&lt;blockquote&gt;We can win no laurels in a war for independence," Webster acknowledged in 1825. "Earlier and worthier hands have gathered them all. Nor are there places for us&amp;nbsp;... [as] the founders of states. Our fathers have filled them. But there remains to us a great duty of defence and preservation.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph J. Ellis; ''Passionate Sage: The Character and Legacy of John Adams.'' (2001) p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''[[Joanne B. Freeman]]'''  Freeman's area of expertise is the life and legacy of Alexander Hamilton as well as political culture of the revolutionary and early national eras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The New York Times|author=Jennifer Schuessler|title=''Up From the Family Basement, a Little-Seen Hamilton Trove''|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/09/arts/design/alexander-hamilton-documents-sothebys.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite-web|publisher=The New York Times|author=Joanne B. Freeman|title=''The Long History of Political Idiocy''|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/opinion/the-long-history-of-political-idiocy.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Slate|author=Joanne B.

'''[[Annette Gordon-Reed]]''' is an American historian and [[Harvard Law School]] professor. She is noted for changing scholarship on [[Thomas Jefferson]] regarding his relationship with [[Sally Hemings]] and her children. She has studied the challenges facing the Founding Fathers particularly as it relates to their position and actions on slavery. She points out "the central dilemma at the heart of American democracy: the desire to create a society based on liberty and equality" that yet does not extend those privileges to all." &lt;ref name="Annette Gordon-Reed 2000 pp. 171-182"/&gt;

'''[[Jack N. Rakove]]''' – Thomas Jefferson

'''[[Peter S. Onuf]]''' – Thomas Jefferson

====Noted collections of the Founding Fathers====
* [[Adams Papers Editorial Project]]
* [[Founders Online]] – a searchable database of over 178,000 documents authored by or addressed to George Washington, John Jay, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams (and family), Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton and James Madison.
* [[The Papers of Alexander Hamilton]]
* [[The Selected Papers of John Jay]] at Columbia University
* [[The Papers of Thomas Jefferson]] at Princeton University
* [[The Papers of James Madison]] at University of Virginia
* [[The Washington Papers]] at University of Virginia

===In stage and film===
The Founding Fathers were portrayed in the [[Tony Award]] winning musical [[1776 (musical)|''1776'']], a stage production about the debates over, and eventual adoption of, the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]; the popular performance was later turned into the [[1776 (film)|1972 film]]

More recently, several of the Founding Fathers – Hamilton, Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Laurens and Burr – were reimagined in [[Hamilton (musical)|''Hamilton'']], an acclaimed production about the life of  [[Alexander Hamilton]], with music, lyrics and book by [[Lin-Manuel Miranda]].The show was inspired by the 2004 biography [[Ron Chernow#Alexander Hamilton|''Alexander Hamilton'']] by historian [[Ron Chernow]]. The rap musical won 11 Tony Awards and a [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Playbill|author=Robert Viagas|title=Hamilton Tops Tony Awards With 11 Wins|access-date=April 9, 2017|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/tony-time-its-broadways-biggest-night}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children's books===
In their 2015 children's book, ''The Founding Fathers'' author Jonah Winter and illustrator [[Barry Blitt]] categorized 14 leading patriots into two teams based on their contributions to the formation of America - the Varsity Squad (Washington, Franklin, Jefferson, John Adams, Madison, Jay, and Hamilton) and the Junior Varsity Squad (Sam Adams, Hancock, Henry, Morris, Marshall, Rush, and Paine).&lt;ref&gt;Winter, Jonah and Blitt, Barry, ''The Founding Fathers!Those Horse-Ridin', Fiddle-Playin', Book-Readin', Gun-Totin' Gentlemen Who Started America'' Simon and Schuster, New York (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geert Adriaans Boomgaard''' (21 September 1788 &amp;ndash; 3 February 1899) was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[supercentenarian]]. He is accepted as the first validated supercentenarian case on record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grg.org/Adams/A.HTM |title=Table A - Verified Supercentenarians (Listed Chronologically By Birth Date)|accessdate=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grg.org/Gallery/Pre1850sGallery.html Gerontology Research Group&lt;/ref&gt; Since there is evidence that he served as a soldier in [[Napoleon]]'s [[Grande Armée]], in the 33rd Light Infantry Division, Boomgaard might in fact have been the oldest military veteran ever for several decades.&lt;ref name="derniersveterans.free.fr"&gt;[http://derniersveterans.free.fr/napoleon1.html Derniers vétérans de l'Armée napoléonienne, Premier Empire] {{fr-icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2016}}

==Life==
[[File:GeertAdriaansBoomgaard.jpg|thumb|left|Boomgaard later in life, in the 1890s]]
Little is known about Boomgaard's life. He was born in [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]], Netherlands, where he also died. His parents were Adriaan Jacobs Boomgaard (1763-1844) and Geesje Geerts Bontekoe (1762-1834).&lt;ref name="delpher"&gt;[http://www.delpher.nl/nl/kranten/view?query=Geert+Adriaans+Boomgaard&amp;coll=ddd&amp;identifier=ddd:011010387:mpeg21:a0422&amp;resultsidentifier=ddd:011010387:mpeg21:a0422 Nieuwsblad van het Noorden, 3 April 1982]&lt;/ref&gt; His father was captain on a boat, and civil records say that Geert did the same work.&lt;ref name=wiewaswie1&gt;[https://www.wiewaswie.nl/personen-zoeken/zoeken/document/a2apersonid/163990124/srcid/18794926/oid/31]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=November 2016}} Other sources&lt;ref name="derniersveterans.free.fr"/&gt; say that he had also served as a soldier in the 33rd Light Infantry Regiment in [[Napoleon]]'s [[Grande Armée]].

At the age of 29, on 4 March 1818, he married Stijntje Bus (baptized 19 February 1797 - died 24 March 1830&lt;ref name="delpher" /&gt;).&lt;ref name="wiewaswie1"/&gt; Stijntje died aged 33, a month after the birth of their 8th child. A year later, 17 March 1831, Boomgaard married Grietje Abels Jonker (baptized 19 May 1793 - 18 May 1864&lt;ref name="delpher" /&gt;), with whom he had four more children, for a total of 12. His last surviving child, Jansje Hinderika, died at the age of 57 in May 1885.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Boomgaard died at age 110 years 135 days in Groningen.

==Evidence==
{{Original research section|date=November 2016}}
Research on Boomgaard was published in three articles by E.J. Heeres in the genealogical periodical ''Gruoninga'' in 1976, 1977 and 1978. The website http://www.stehelene.org, which is dedicated to the rebuilding of the lost archives on the Médaille de Sainte-Hélène, shows his photograph, his (presumed) personal Sainte-Hélène medal, and a certificate which states that "Adriaans, Gerrit, à Groningue, Pays-Bas, received this medal" on behalf of his active military service during the reign of [[Napoleon I]]. The certificate is registered at la Grande Chancellerie No. 1871, and bears the stamped signature of the Duc de Plaisance Général {{ill|Anne-Charles Lebrun|fr}}, Grand Chancelier (1853&amp;ndash;1859).

'''George A. Best''' was an English [[association footballer|football]] [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]]. He played professionally for [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] in the early 20th century, either side of spells with his hometown club, [[Worksop Town F.C.|Worksop Town]].

Best made his debut for Blackpool just over halfway through the [[1925–26 Blackpool F.C. season|1925–26]] season, as deputy for [[Len Crompton]], in a 5–2 defeat at Derby County. He appeared in the two successive games — a 3–0 home victory over Bradford City and a 5–0 reversal at Port Vale — before Crompton returned to the line-up.

The following [[1926–27 Blackpool F.C. season|1926–27]] campaign saw Best make 24 [[Football League|League]] appearances. He played his final game for the club on 18 April, in a 2–2 draw at South Shields.

[[File:Joan of Arc miniature graded.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Joan of Arc]] is considered a medieval Christian heroine of France for her role in the [[Hundred Years' War]], and was canonized as a [[Roman Catholic saint]]]]
[[File:Perseo in Villa San Marco Stabiae.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Perseus and the head of Medusa in a Roman fresco at [[Stabiae]]. Unlike medieval and modern heroes, classical heroes did great deeds out of esteem and fame rather than out of any concern for the good of people]]

A '''hero''' (masculine) or '''heroine''' (feminine) is a real person or a main character of a literary work who, in the face of danger, combats adversity through feats of [[ingenuity]], [[bravery]] or [[Physical strength|strength]]; the original hero type of classical epics did such things for the sake of glory and honor. On the other hand are [[Medieval]] and [[modern history|modern]] heroes, who perform great deeds for the common good instead of the classical goal of pride and fame.

The concept of the hero can be found in [[classical literature]]. It is the main or revered character in [[Epic poetry|heroic epic poetry]] celebrated through ancient legends of a people, often striving for military conquest and living by a continually flawed personal honor code.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Encyclopedia - Britannica Online Encyclopedia|url = http://academic.eb.com/EBchecked/topic/263398/hero|website = academic.eb.com|accessdate = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of a hero has changed throughout time. [[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam Webster]] dictionary defines a hero as "a person who is admired for great or brave acts or fine qualities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hero|title=Definition of HERO|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of heroes range from mythological figures, such as [[Gilgamesh]], [[Achilles]] and [[Iphigenia]], to historical figures, such as [[Joan of Arc]] or [[Sophie Scholl]], modern heroes like [[Alvin York]], [[Audie Murphy]] and [[Chuck Yeager]], and fictional [[superheroes]], including [[Superman]] and [[Batman]].

==Etymology==
The word ''hero'' comes from the Greek ἥρως (''hērōs''), "hero" (literally "protector" or "defender"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=hero|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly one such as [[Heracles]] with divine ancestry or later given divine honors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dh%28%2Frws ἥρως]
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; Before the decipherment of [[Linear B]] the original form of the word was assumed to be *{{lang|grc|ἥρωϝ-}}, ''hērōw-'', but the Mycenaean compound ''ti-ri-se-ro-e'' demonstrates the absence of -w-.

According to the ''[[American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', the [[Proto-Indo-European]] root is ''*ser'' meaning "to protect". According to Eric Partridge in ''Origins,'' the Greek word  ''Hērōs'' "is akin to" the Latin ''seruāre,'' meaning ''to safeguard''. Partridge concludes, "The basic sense of both [[Hera]] and hero would therefore be 'protector'." [[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] rejects an Indo-European derivation and asserts that the word has a [[Pre-Greek]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 526.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antiquity==
{{see also|Greek hero cult}}
A classical hero is considered to be a "warrior who lives and dies in the pursuit of honor" and asserts their greatness by "the brilliancy and efficiency with which they kill".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Each classical hero's life focuses on fighting, which occurs in war or during an epic quest. Classical heroes are commonly semi-divine and extraordinarily gifted, like [[Achilles]], evolving into heroic characters through their perilous circumstances.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; While these heroes are incredibly resourceful and skilled, they are often foolhardy, court disaster, risk their followers' lives for trivial matters, and behave arrogantly in a childlike manner.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; During classical times, people regarded heroes with the highest esteem and utmost importance, explaining their prominence within epic literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levin | first1 = Saul | year = 1984 | title = Love and the Hero of the Iliad | url = | journal = Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association | volume = 80 | issue = | pages = 43–50 | doi=10.2307/283510| jstor = 283510 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance of these mortal figures marks a revolution of audiences and writers turning away from [[Twelve Olympians|immortal gods]] to mortal mankind, whose heroic moments of glory survive in the memory of their descendants, extending their legacy.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

[[Hector]] was a [[Troy|Trojan]] prince and the greatest fighter for Troy in the [[Trojan War]], which is known primarily through [[Homer]]'s ''[[The Iliad]]''. Hector acted as leader of the Trojans and their allies in the defense of Troy, "killing 31,000 Greek fighters," offers Hyginus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Hector was known not only for his courage but also for his noble and courtly nature. Indeed, Homer places Hector as peace-loving, thoughtful as well as bold, a good son, husband and father, and without darker motives. However, his familial values conflict greatly with his heroic aspirations in ''The Iliad,'' as he cannot be both the protector of [[Troy]] and a father to his child.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Hector is ultimately betrayed by the gods when [[Athena]] appears disguised as his ally [[Deiphobus]] and convinces him to take on Achilles, leading to his death at the hands of a superior warrior.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Homer. ''The Iliad.'' Trans. Robert Fagles (1990). NY: Penguin Books. Chapter 14&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:The_Rage_of_Achilles,_by_Giovanni_Battista_Tiepolo_(1696-1770),_Italian_Rococo_painter.jpg|thumb|An 18th century depiction of ''The Rage of Achilles'', by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]]|302x302px]][[Achilles]] was a Greek Hero who was considered the most formidable military fighter in the entire Trojan War and the central character of ''The Iliad.'' He was the child of [[Thetis]] and [[Peleus]], making him a [[Demigod|demi-god]]. He wielded superhuman strength on the battlefield and was blessed with a close relationship to the [[Greek gods|Gods]]. Achilles famously refuses to fight after his dishonoring at the hands of Agamemnon, and only returns to the war due to unadulterated rage after Hector kills his close friend [[Patroclus]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Achilles was known for uncontrollable rage that defined many of his bloodthirsty actions, such as defiling Hector's corpse by dragging it around the city of Troy. Achilles plays a tragic role in ''The Iliad'' brought about by constant [https://books.google.com/books?id=5TFUv2VRKd8C&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=achilles+dehumanization&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5D2sb_hGx_&amp;sig=iJrfJQdt0VhRVG2iJoRf-Nc6oqA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwje8uWTosvJAhWGyT4KHZE7BUoQ6AEIJTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=achilles%20dehumanization&amp;f=false de-humanization] throughout the epic, having his ''menis'' (wrath) overpower his ''philos'' (love).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Mortal Hero: An Introduction to Homer's Iliad|last = Schein|first = Seth|publisher = University of California Press|year = 1984|isbn = |location = |pages = 58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heroes in myth often had close but conflicted relationships with the gods. Thus Heracles's name means "the glory of [[Hera]]", even though he was tormented all his life by Hera, the Queen of the Gods. Perhaps the most striking example is the Athenian king [[Erechtheus]], whom [[Poseidon]] killed for choosing [[Athena]] over him as the city's patron god. When the Athenians worshiped Erechtheus on the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]], they invoked him as ''Poseidon  Erechtheus''.

[[Destiny|Fate]], or destiny, plays a massive role in the stories of classical heroes. The classical hero's heroic significance stems from battlefield conquests, an inherently dangerous action.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The gods in [[Greek mythology|Greek Mythology]], when interacting with the heroes, often foreshadow the hero's eventual death on the battlefield. Countless heroes and gods go to great lengths to alter their  pre-destined fate, but with no success, as no immortal can change their prescribed outcomes by the [[Fates|three Fates]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.auburn.wednet.edu/cms/lib03/WA01001938/Centricity/Domain/2205/Fate%20reading.pdf|title = Articles and musing on the concept of Fate for the ancient Greeks|date = |accessdate = |website = Auburn University|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent example of this is found in ''[[Oedipus Rex]].'' After learning that his son, [[Oedipus]], will end up killing him, the King of Thebes, [[Laius]], takes huge steps to assure his son's death by removing him from the kingdom. But, Oedipus slays his father without an afterthought when he unknowingly encounters him in a dispute on the road many years later. The lack of recognition enabled Oedipus to slay his father, ironically further binding his father to his fate.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Stories of heroism may serve as [[moral example]]s. However, classical heroes often didn't embody the Christian notion of an upstanding, perfectly moral hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Four Conceptions of the Heroic|url = http://www.fellowshipofreason.com/archives/4heroes.htm|website = www.fellowshipofreason.com|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Achilles's character-issues of hateful rage lead to merciless slaughter and his overwhelming pride lead to him only joining the Trojan War because he didn't want his soldiers to win all of the glory. Classical heroes, regardless of their morality, were placed in religion. In [[classical antiquity]], cults that venerated deified heroes such as [[Heracles]], [[Perseus]], and [[Achilles]] played an important role in Ancient Greek religion.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Graf, Fritz. (2006) "Hero Cult." ''Brills New Pauly.'' Retrieved from http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/brill-s-new-pauly/hero-cult-e511460?s.num=1&amp;s.f.s2_parent=s.f.book.brill-s-new-pauly&amp;s.q=hero.&lt;/ref&gt; These ancient [[Greek hero cult]]s worshipped heroes from oral [[Epic Cycle|epic tradition]], with these heroes often bestowing blessings, especially healing ones, on individuals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Myth and monomyth==
[[File:JourneytotheWest.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The four heroes from the 16th-century Chinese novel ''[[Journey to the West]]'']]
The concept of the "Mythic Hero Archetype" was first developed by [[FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]] in his 1936 book, ''The Hero, A Study in Tradition, Myth and Drama''. It is a set of 22 common traits that he said were shared by many heroes in various cultures, myths and religions throughout history and around the world.  Raglan argued that the higher the score, the more likely the figure is mythical.&lt;ref&gt;Lord Raglan. ''The Hero: A Study in Tradition, Myth and Drama by Lord Raglan'', Dover Publications, 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of a story archetype of the standard [[monomyth]]ical "hero's [[quest]]" that was reputed to be pervasive across all cultures is somewhat controversial. Expounded mainly by [[Joseph Campbell]] in his 1949 work ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'', it illustrates several uniting themes of hero stories that hold similar ideas of what a hero represents, despite vastly different cultures and beliefs. The monomyth or Hero's Journey  consists of three separate stages including the Departure, Initiation, and Return. Within these stages there are several archetypes that the hero or heroine may follow including the call to adventure (which they may initially refuse), supernatural aid, proceeding down a road of trials, achieving a realization about themselves (or an apotheosis), and attaining the freedom to live through their quest or journey. Campbell offered examples of stories with similar themes  such as [[Krishna]], [[Buddha]], [[Apollonius of Tyana]], and [[Jesus]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Joseph Campbell in ''The Hero With a Thousand Faces'' Princeton University Press, 2004 [1949], 140, {{ISBN|0-691-11924-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the themes he explores is the androgynous hero, who combines male and female traits, like Bodhisattva: "The first wonder to be noted here is the androgynous character of the Bodhisattva: masculine Avalokiteshvara, feminine Kwan Yin."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In his 1968 book, ''The Masks of God: Occidental Mythology'', Campbell writes "It is clear that, whether accurate or not as to biographical detail, the moving legend of the Crucified and Risen Christ was fit to bring a new warmth, immediacy, and humanity, to the old motifs of the beloved [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]], [[Adonis]], and [[Osiris]] cycles."&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Campbell]]. The Masks of God: Occidental Mythology'' Penguin, reprinted, {{ISBN|0-14-004306-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slavic fairy tales==
[[File:Vasnetsov samolet.jpg|thumb|[[Ivan Tsarevich]], a hero of [[Slavic mythology|Russian folklore]]]]
[[Vladimir Propp]], in his analysis of the Russian [[fairy tale]], concluded that a fairy tale had only eight ''[[dramatis personæ]]'', of which one was the hero,&lt;ref name="Propp"&gt;Vladimir Propp, ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|p. 80}} and his analysis has been widely applied to non-Russian folklore. The actions that fall into such a hero's sphere include:
# Departure on a quest
# Reacting to the test of a [[Donor (fairy tale)|donor]]
# Marrying a princess (or similar figure)
Propp distinguished between ''seekers'' and ''victim-heroes''. A [[villain]] could initiate the issue by kidnapping the hero or driving him out; these were victim-heroes. On the other hand, an antagonist could rob the hero, or kidnap someone close to him, or, without the villain's intervention, the hero could realize that he lacked something and set out to find it; these heroes are seekers. Victims may appear in tales with seeker heroes, but the tale does not follow them both.&lt;ref name="Propp" /&gt;{{Rp|36}}

No history can be written without consideration of the lengthy list of [[List of medals for bravery|recipients of national medals for bravery]], populated by firefighters, policemen and policewomen, ambulance medics and ordinary have-a-go heroes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/12/25/1040511087609.html smh.com.au: "Everyday heroes"], 26 Dec 2002&lt;/ref&gt; These persons risked their lives to try to save or protect the lives of others: for example, the Canadian [[Cross of Valour (Canada)|Cross of Valour (C.V.)]] "recognizes acts of the most conspicuous courage in circumstances of extreme peril";&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=13503 gg.ca: "Decorations for Bravery Ceremony"], 2 Feb 2010&lt;/ref&gt; examples of recipients are [[Mary Dohey]] and [[David Gordon Cheverie]].

The philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] gave a central role to the "hero", personalized by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], as the incarnation of a particular culture's ''[[Volksgeist]]'', and thus of the general ''[[Zeitgeist]]''. [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s 1841 ''On Heroes, Hero Worship and the Heroic in History'' also accorded a key function to heroes and great men in history. Carlyle centered history on the [[biography]] of a few central individuals such as [[Oliver Cromwell]] or [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]]. His heroes were political and military figures, the founders or topplers of states. His history of great men included geniuses good and, perhaps for the first time in historical study, evil.

Explicit defenses of Carlyle's position were rare in the second part of the 20th century. Most in the [[philosophy of history]] school contend that the motive forces in history can best be described only with a wider lens than the one that Carlyle used for his portraits. For example, [[Karl Marx]] argued that history was determined by the massive social forces at play in "[[class struggle]]s", not by the individuals by whom these forces are played out. After Marx, [[Herbert Spencer]] wrote at the end of the 19th century: "You must admit that the genesis of the great man depends on the long series of complex influences which has produced the race in which he appears, and the social state into which that race has slowly grown....Before he can remake his society, his society must make him."&lt;ref name=Spencer&gt;Spencer, Herbert. ''[https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=96277756  The Study of Sociology]'', Appleton, 1896, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Foucault]] argued in [[Philosophy of history#Michel Foucault's analysis of historical and political discourse|his analysis of societal communication and debate]] that history was mainly the "science of the [[Sovereignty|sovereign]]", until its inversion by the "historical and political popular discourse".

[[File:Mandela Bust at Southbank.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bust of Nelson Mandela erected on London's [[South Bank]] by the [[Greater London Council]] administration of [[Ken Livingstone]] in 1985]]
[[File:Raoul Wallenberg.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The Swedish Diplomat [[Raoul Wallenberg]] saved the lives of tens of thousands of Jews in Budapest during World War II.&lt;ref name="thomas.loc.gov"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Library of Congress: Bill Summary &amp; Status 112th Congress (2011–2012) H.R. 3001|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.3001:}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.raoulwallenberg.net/?en/wallenberg/tributes/philately/3368.htm | title = Holocaust Hero Honored on Postage Stamp | accessdate = | year = 1996 | publisher = [[United States Postal Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Modern examples of the typical hero are  [[Minnie Vautrin]], [[Norman Bethune]],  [[Alan Turing]], [[Raoul Wallenberg]], [[Chiune Sugihara]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Mother Teresa]], [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Oswaldo Paya]], [[Oscar Biscet]], and [[Aung San Suu Kyi]].

The [[Annales School]], led by [[Lucien Febvre]], [[Marc Bloch]] and [[Fernand Braudel]], would contest the exaggeration of the role of [[subject (philosophy)|individual subjects]] in history. Indeed, Braudel distinguished various time scales, one accorded to the life of an individual, another accorded to the life of a few human generations, and the last one to [[civilization]]s, in which [[geography]], [[economics]] and [[demography]] play a role considerably more decisive than that of individual subjects.

Among noticeable events in the studies of the role of the hero and [[Great men theory|Great man]] in history one should mention [[Sydney Hook]]'s book (1943) ''[[Sidney Hook#The Hero in History|The Hero in History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hook, S. 1955 [1943]. The Hero in History. A Study in Limitation and Possibility. Boston, MA: Beacon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the twentieth century such male-focused theory has been contested, among others by feminists writers such as [[Judith Fetterley]] in ''The Resisting Reader'' (1977)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Resisting Reader|last = Fetterley|first = Judith|publisher = Indiana University Press|year = 1977|isbn = |location = Bloomington, IN|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and literary theorist [[Nancy K. Miller]], ''The Heroine's Text: Readings in the French and English Novel, 1722–1782''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Heroine's Text: Readings in the French and English Novel, 1722–1782|last = Miller|first = Nancy K.|publisher = Columbia University Press|year = 1980|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the epoch of [[globalization]] an individual can still change the development of the country and of the whole world so this gives reasons to some scholars to suggest returning to the problem of the role of the hero in history from the viewpoint of modern historical knowledge and using up-to-date methods of historical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonid Grinin|Grinin, Leonid]]  2010. The Role of an Individual in History: A Reconsideration. Social Evolution &amp; History, Vol. 9 No. 2 (pp. 95–136) [http://www.socionauki.ru/journal/articles/129622/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the frameworks of developing [[counterfactual history]], attempts are made to examine some hypothetical scenarios of historical development. The hero attracts much attention because most of those scenarios are based on the suppositions: what would have happened if this or that historical individual had or had not been alive.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson. W. The Lead Economy Sequence in World Politics (From Sung China to the United States): Selected Counterfactuals. Journal of Globalization Studies. Vol. 1, num. 1. 2010. pp. 6–28 [http://www.socionauki.ru/journal/articles/126971/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender differences ==
If the term "heroine" exists,{{clarify|reason=|date=September 2018}} "hero" is often the predominantly used term even though its neutrality can be put into question. The definitions of the heroine often refer back to the one of the hero, but sometimes insinuate that their deeds are of less value, or were obtained only thanks to their love of God or a country or of a man. Therefore, implying that an external explanation for the extraordinary nature of her deeds is needed to justify them. The warrior women is considered unholy, unnatural. These figures tend to be erased because they don't fit in the feminine values they are supposed to represent.
Acts of heroism coming from women are acceptable, during specific time, like when men are at war, during times of crisis, but they are otherwise often seen as suspicious. Moreover, women are often not individualized, but praised as a group for heroic deeds. [[Women in the military]] were often subordinated to tasks less likely to be praised than armed combat, and are rather praised for their courage as a general force, nurses during wartime are a good example of this phenomenon.
If their story gets told, they are made to fit in the acceptable script. Their story is told in a way as to match the expectations of [[femininity]] ex: maternal love, compassion, fidelity, resistance, defense. Etc. So the set of strengths in which a heroine could historically express her value are overall not the same and perceived as less valuable than their [[masculine]] counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;

{{quote|In general, the cultural repertoire of heroic stories requires different qualities for each gender. The contrast of the ideal narrative line pits the autonomous ego-enhancing hero single-handedly and single-heartedly progressing toward a goal versus the long-suffering, selfless, socially embedded heroine, being moved in many directions, lacking the tenacious loyalty demanded of a quest.&lt;ref&gt;

If they get mentioned in history, the way their story is told also differs from their male counterpart, they are generally portrayed as young and beautiful, their actions are limited to a short time
lapse in opposition to the possibility of a long heroic career for male heroes, underlying feelings that led to their heroic acts are underlined, overall less details about their life are kept and
emphasis is put over their tragic death. Not to forget that heroes and heroines are part of a social construct, their history is told and changes throughout history to serve different purposes of memory, propaganda according to diverse social, political or religious evolutions.&lt;ref&gt;

==Modern fiction==
{{Further information|Vanity Fair (novel)|Superhero}}

[[File:Batman_and_Robin_1966.JPG|thumb|225x225px|[[Batman]] ([[Adam West]]) and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] (Burt Ward) in the 1966–1968 TV Series ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]''.]]
	 
The word "hero" or "heroine", in modern times, is sometimes used to describe the [[protagonist]] or the [[Romantic interest (theatre)|love interest]] of a story, a usage which can conflict with the superhuman expectations of heroism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A classic example is [[Anna Karenina]], the lead character in the novel of the same title by [[Leo Tolstoy]]. In modern literature the hero is more and more a problematic concept. In 1848, for example, [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] gave ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'' the subtitle ''A Novel without a Hero'', and imagined a world in which no sympathetic character was to be found.&lt;ref&gt;[[Northrop Frye]], ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]'', p. 34, {{ISBN|0-691-01298-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vanity Fair'' is a satirical representation of the absence of truly moral heroes in the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;Shmoop Editorial Team. (2008, November 11). ''Vanity Fair Theme of Morality and Ethics''. Retrieved December 6, 2015, from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.shmoop.com/vanity-fair-thackeray/morality-ethics-theme.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The story focuses on the characters Emmy Sedley and Becky Sharpe (the latter as the clearly defined anti-hero), with the plot focused on the eventual marriage of these two characters to rich men, revealing character flaws as the story progresses. Even the most sympathetic characters, like Captain Dobbin, are susceptible to weakness, as he is often narcissistic and melancholy.

The larger-than-life hero is a more common feature of [[fantasy]] (particularly in [[Comic book|comic-books]] and [[High fantasy|epic fantasy]]) than more realist works.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;[[L. Sprague de Camp]], ''[[Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers]]:  The Makers of Heroic Fantasy'', p. 5 {{ISBN|0-87054-076-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these larger-than life figures remain prevalent in society. The [[superhero]] genre is a multibillion-dollar industry that includes comic books, movies, toys and video games. Superheroes usually possess extraordinary talents and powers that no living human could ever emulate. The superhero stories often pit a [[Supervillain|super villain]] against the hero, with the hero fighting the crime caused by the super villain. Examples of long-running superheroes include [[Superman]], [[Batman]], [[Spider-Man]] and [[Wonder Woman]].

==Psychology==
[[Social psychology]] has begun paying attention to heroes and heroism. Zeno Franco and [[Philip Zimbardo]] point out differences between heroism and altruism, and they offer evidence that observers' perceptions of unjustified risk plays a role above and beyond risk type in determining the ascription of heroic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Franco | first1 = Z. | last2 = Blau | first2 = K. | last3 = Zimbardo | first3 = P. | year = 2011 | title = Heroism: A conceptual analysis and differentiation between heroic action and altruism | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2011-07260-001/ | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 99–113 | doi=10.1037/a0022672| citeseerx = 10.1.1.366.8315 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[evolutionary psychology]] explanation for heroic risk-taking is that it is a [[costly signal]] demonstrating the ability of the hero. It can be seen as one form of [[altruism]] for which there are also several other evolutionary explanations.&lt;ref name=AEP1&gt;Pat Barcaly. The evolution of charitable behaviour and the power of reputation. In {{Cite book | last1 = Roberts | first1 = S. C. | editor1-last = Roberts | doi = 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199586073.001.0001 | editor1-first = S. Craig | title = Applied Evolutionary Psychology | year = 2011 | publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 9780199586073 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roma Chatterji has suggested that the hero or more generally protagonist is first and foremost a symbolic representation of the person who is experiencing the story while reading, listening or watching;&lt;ref name=Chatterji&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chatterji|first=Roma|date=January 1986|title=The Voyage of the Hero: The Self and the Other in One Narrative Tradition of Purulia|journal=Contributions to Indian Sociology|issue=19|pages=95–114|doi=10.1177/006996685019001007|volume=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus the relevance of the hero to the individual relies a great deal on how much similarity there is between the two. One reason for the hero-as-self interpretation of stories and myths is the human inability to view the world from any perspective but a personal one.

In the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning book ''[[The Denial of Death]]'', [[Ernest Becker]] argues that human civilization is ultimately an elaborate, symbolic defense mechanism against the knowledge of our mortality, which in turn acts as the emotional and intellectual response to our basic [[survival mechanism]]. Becker explains that a basic duality in human life exists between the physical world of objects and a symbolic world of human meaning. Thus, since humanity has a dualistic nature consisting of a physical self and a symbolic self, we are able to transcend the [[dilemma]] of mortality through [[heroism]], by focusing our attention mainly on our symbolic selves. This symbolic self-focus takes the form of an individual's "[[immortality]] project" (or "''[[causa sui]]'' project"), which is essentially a symbolic belief-system that ensures oneself is believed superior to physical reality.  By successfully living under the terms of the immortality project, people feel they can become heroic and, henceforth, part of something eternal; something that will never die as compared to their physical body. This, in turn, gives people the feeling that their lives have meaning, a purpose, and are significant in the grand scheme of things. Another theme running throughout the book is that humanity's traditional "hero-systems", such as [[religion]], are no longer convincing in the [[Age of Enlightenment|age of reason]]. Science attempts to serve as an immortality project, something that Becker believes it can never do, because it is unable to provide agreeable, absolute meanings to human life. The book states that we need new convincing "illusions" that enable us to feel heroic in ways that are agreeable. Becker, however, does not provide any definitive answer, mainly because he believes that there is no perfect solution. Instead, he hopes that gradual realization of humanity's innate motivations, namely death, can help to bring about a better world. [[Terror Management Theory]] has generated evidence supporting this perspective.

'''Keibu keioiba''' is a mythological or fictional character based on [[Meitei people|Meetei]] folklore. It is a creature having half tiger and half human features, depicted to be transformed from a learned ancient Manipuri physician. He was experimenting his magical skills and powers, and came up with this idea of turning himself into a powerful man with strength of a tiger. He became this creature with the head, limbs and strength of a tiger but failed to remember how to revert to his normal human form, owing to low memory or thinking capacity of a tiger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e-pao.net/epSubPageExtractor.asp?src=manipur.Folks.Folk_Tales.Keibu_Keioiba_By_Nganthoi_Lourembam |title=Keibu Keioiba – Fungawari Singbul |publisher=E-Pao|author=B. Jayantakumar Sharma }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The tale==
This is a story of a kind, dedicated and skilled ancient Manipuri physician, who used to ride on a horse and visit places to heal the suffering ailments. As his knowledge and skill kept on increasing day by day, he kept on wanting to learn more and more. At a time, he was able to do whatever he wanted. He kept on conducting experiments until he decided to turn himself into a tiger one day, for he wanted the power of a tiger.

He taught his wife how to help him turn into a tiger and how to return to his human form. But, as soon as he became the tiger-like creature/ keibu keioiba, he developed the tiger-instinct of roaring and frightening people. So, his wife ran away from him before he could be subjected to return to his human form. Instead, he even tried to kill his wife and ran away in the wild far from home.
When he got hungry, he would come to human villages to steal poultry or fish or livestock, as he never learned how to hunt like a real tiger in the wild. He became the feared and the hated. He began to target humans for food.

He came to a village and took a young girl called Thabaton, who was home alone, left by her seven brothers for work. He was avenged by the brothers and the girl was saved.

==The Morale==
The story depicts the never-ending desire of man for getting more which ultimately ruins himself. It teaches a lesson to us about the evil effects of this human nature. We can witness many examples of this today- e.g., global warming because of the never-ending industrial race, world devastation by never ending arms race in world wars, etc.

==Impacts in Manipur or Meetei society==
Almost every Manipuri grow up listening to this folktale from their elders. It is a common story told to kids over many generations.

==Movie/s==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Keibu keioiba movie.jpg|thumb|Keibu keioiba, tigerhead film poster.]] --&gt;
A 2-D Manipuri animated film, titled as "keibu keioiba", has been made, directed by Bhumenjoy konsam, released in 2009, based on the original folktale. The movie has increased awareness of the story to the selfie-generation kids of present Manipur as well as to other communities.&lt;ref&gt;keibu keioiba / tigerhead&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Las Trece Rosas.jpeg|thumb|250px|Plaque in the cemetery wall.]]
'''"Las Trece Rosas"''' (the ''Thirteen Roses'') is the name given in [[Spain]] to a group of thirteen young women who were executed by a [[Francoist Spain|Francoist]] [[Execution by firing squad|firing squad]] just after the conclusion of the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Their execution was part of a massive execution campaign known as the ''"saca de agosto"'', which included 43 young men (among them a fourteen-year-old).&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Paul. ''El holocausto español. Odio y exterminio en la guerra civil y después.'' Editorial Debate. Barcelona. 2011. p.633&lt;/ref&gt;

The thirteen victims were: Carmen Barrero Aguado (age 24), Martina Barroso García (age 22), Blanca Brissac Vázquez (age 29), Pilar Bueno Ibáñez (age 27), Julia Conesa Conesa (age 19), Adelina García Casillas (age 19), Elena Gil Olaya (age 20), Virtudes González García (age 18), Ana López Gallego (age 21), Joaquina López Laffite (age 23), Dionisia Manzanero Salas (age 20), Victoria Muñoz García (age 19), and Luisa Rodríguez de la Fuente (age 18).&lt;ref&gt;Egido León, Ángeles. ''El perdon de Franco. La represión de las mujeres en el Madrid de posguerra.''.Los libros de la catarata. 2009. Madrid.p.63&lt;/ref&gt; Seven of the women were under age - in Francoist Spain the age of majority was 21.

Following the capitulation of [[Madrid]] to [[Francisco Franco|Franco's]] troops and the end of the Civil War, the Madrid Provincial Committee of the [[Unified Socialist Youth]] (JSU) (an organisation resulting from the merger of the [[Socialist Youth of Spain|Socialist Youth]] and the [[Communist Youth Union of Spain|Communist Youth]] even though most pro-[[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) members had abandoned the organisation) tried to reorganise under the leadership of 21-year-old José Peña Brea. He was betrayed, arrested, and tortured; under torture he revealed the names of his collaborators, which led to a wave of arrests of JSU members in Madrid. The Thirteen Roses were among the many JSU members captured and imprisoned by the police. During their detention in the Ventas prison they were repeatedly tortured and humiliated, and conditions in the prison were considered inhumane and overcrowded. They were ultimately executed by firing squad against the wall of the East Cemetery (now [[Cementerio de la Almudena|la Almudena]]) on 5 August 1939. Many of their comrades at the prison recall that while they were being driven away by lorry to their deaths, they sang the "Youthful Guardsmen" (JSU's anthem) so as to be heard by their comrades who remained in jail. The victims were accused of aiding a military rebellion and of assassinating a high-ranking [[political police]] officer, his 16-year-old daughter, and driver who were murdered after they had already been detained.&lt;ref&gt;Julía. Santos; Casanova, Julián; Solé i sabaté, Josep Maria; Villarroya, Joan; Moreno, Francisco. ''Víctimas de la guerra civil.'' Editorial Temas de Hoy. Madrid. 2006. p.329&lt;/ref&gt;   

In 2005, a foundation (''Fundación Trece Rosas'') was created in Spain to keep their memory alive.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10188">[[File:Magnes the shepherd.jpg|thumb|Illustration of Magnes the shepherd from a 19th-century text]]
'''Magnes the shepherd''', sometimes described as '''Magnes the shepherd boy''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Daily Herald|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/44791889/|page=23|title=Compasses Invented by Chinese|date=November 6, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a mythological figure, possibly based on a real person, who was cited by [[Pliny the Elder]] (23 CE – 79 CE) as discovering [[Natural remanent magnetization|natural magnetism]]. His name, "Magnes", the Latin word for ''[[magnetite]]'', has been attributed as the origin of the Latin [[Root (linguistics)|root]] that has passed into English, giving its speakers the words ''[[magnet]]'', ''[[magnetism]]'', the mentioned ore, and related formulations. Other authorities have attributed the word origin to other sources.

As set out in Pliny's ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'' ("Natural History"), an early [[encyclopedia]] published c. 77&amp;nbsp;CE – c. 79&amp;nbsp;CE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roos|first=Anna Marie|title=The Correspondence of Dr. Martin Lister (1639–1712). Volume One: 1662–1677|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aByoBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87|year=2015|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|location=Leiden, Netherlands|isbn=978-90-04-26332-1|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as translated from the Latin in [[Robert Jacobus Forbes]]' ''Studies in Ancient Technology'', Pliny wrote the following (attributing the source of his information, in turn, to [[Nicander|Nicander of Colophon]]):&lt;ref name ="Forbes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Forbes|first=Robert Jacobus|title=Studies in Ancient Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LbA3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA179|volume=IX|year=1964|publisher=E. J. Brill|location=Leiden, Netherlands|page=179|oclc=180355272}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nicander is our authority that it [magnetite ore] was called Magnes from the man who first discovered it on Mount Ida{{Cref2|note 1}} and he is said to have found it when the nails of his shoes and the ferrule of his staff adhered to it, as he was pasturing his herds.&lt;ref name ="Forbes" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The passage appears at Book XXXVI of ''Naturalis Historia'', covering "The Natural History of Stones", at chapter 25 entitled "The Magnet: Three Remedies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pliny the Elder|translator=John Bostock|translator2=H. T. Riley|title=The Natural History of Pliny|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9zwZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA355|volume=VI|year=1857|publisher=H. G. Bohn|page=355|chapter=The Magnet: Three Remedies|location=London|oclc=615995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Pliny's description is often cited, the story of Magnes the shepherd is postulated by physicist Gillian Turner to be much older, dating from approximately 900 BCE.&lt;ref name="Turner"&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Gillian|title=North Pole, South Pole: The Epic Quest to Solve the Great Mystery of Earth’s Magnetism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UfCC0lAtU_0C&amp;pg=PA6|year=2011|publisher=Awa Press|location=Wellington, NZ|isbn=978-1-61519-132-1|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Any writings Nicander may have made on the subject have since been [[Lost work|lost]].&lt;ref name="Colophon2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicander of Colophon|title=Poems and Poetical Fragments|editors=Translated by A.S.F.

Written in approximately 600 CE, book XVI of ''[[Etymologiae]]'' by [[Isidore of Seville]] tells the same story as Pliny, but places Magnes in India.&lt;ref name="Etymologiae"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Etymologies of Isidore of Seville|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ep502syZv8C&amp;pg=PA319|date=2006|orig-year=source text c. 600 CE|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-45616-6|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is repeated in [[Vincent of Beauvais]]' ''Miroir du Monde'' (c. 1250 CE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Monthly literary register|title=The Monthly magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N2kEAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA571|year=1833|publisher=Charles Tilt|location=London|page=571}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Thomas Nicols' 1652 work, ''Lapidary, or, the History of Pretious Stones'', wherein he describes Magnes as a "shepherd of India, who was wont to keep his flocks about those mountains in India, where there was an abundance of [[lodestone]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicols|first=Thomas|title=Lapidary, or, the History of Pretious Stones: With Cautions for the Undeceiving of All Those that Deal with Pretious Stones|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=udBEAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA196|year=1652|publisher=Thomas Buck|location=Cambridge|page=196|oclc=12968778}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following from Pliny's account, the shepherd's name has been often cited as giving rise to the Latin [[Root (linguistics)|root word]] and etymological source of the English word for magnet and the coterie of its related word forms such as ''magnetite'', ''magnet'', ''magnetism'', ''[[magnesium]]'', ''[[manganese]]'' and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weicker|first=Theodore|title=Merck Report: A Practical Journal of Pharmacy, Materia Medica, and Chemistry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hkI1AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA289|volume=X|year=1901|publisher=Merck &amp; Company|location=New York|page=289|chapter=The Myth of Pliny|oclc=243874912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authorities, including the Roman poet and philosopher [[Lucretius]] ([[circa|c.]] 99&amp;nbsp;BCE – c. 55&amp;nbsp;BCE), have attributed the [[etymology]] of ''magnet'', and progeny, to the name of the [[Lydians|Lydian]] city, [[Magnesia ad Sipylum]] ([[Manisa|Manisa, Turkey]] in modern times), where magnetic ore may have first been discovered or recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deer|first=William Alexander|title=Rock-forming Minerals: Non-silicates|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ASjwAAAAMAAJ|year=1962|publisher=Longmans|location=London|page=69|oclc=174165277}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allom|first1=Thomas|last2=Walsh|first2=Robert |title=Constantinople and the scenery of the seven churches of Asia Minor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dh5fAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA8-IA6|year=1839|publisher=Fisher, son, &amp; Co|location=London|page=10|oclc=332119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other ancient locations have been attributed as the origin, including the Greek province Thracian Magnesia, and the [[Ionia]]n city of [[Magnesia on the Maeander|Magnesia ad Maeandrum]].&lt;ref name="Senning"&gt;{{cite book|last=Senning|first=Alexander|title=Elsevier's Dictionary of Chemoetymology: The Whys and Whences of Chemical Nomenclature and Terminology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fl4sdCYrq3cC&amp;pg=PA240|date=2006|publisher=Elsevier|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-0-08-048881-3|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that the legend of Magnes the shepherd could be the origin of ''magnet'', et al., and the legend itself has been criticized. Pliny's story is characterized in Gillian Turner's book ''North Pole, South Pole: The Epic Quest to Solve the Great Mystery of Earth’s Magnetism'' (2011) as "no doubt embellished by centuries of retelling."&lt;ref name="Turner" /&gt; In the 1896 treatise ''Coil and Current; or the Triumphs of Electricity'', the authors write: &lt;blockquote&gt;'Magnet' is derived from the legend of Magnes, or from the territory of Magnesia. Pliny states that Magnes, the shepherd, discovered it, and the legend told of him is that while carrying a message over Mount Ida he felt his feet clinging to the earth, to the iron ore which lay thickly upon the hill. Hence the name of the Magnet. But Magnesia was a territory whence this native iron was for hundreds of years exported, and the name "Magnet" is, no doubt, due to this place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frith|first1=Henry|author2=W.

'''Margaret Ann Neve''' (''née'' '''Harvey'''; 18 May 1792 – 4 April 1903) was the first recorded female [[supercentenarian]] and the second validated human to reach the age of 110 after [[Geert Adriaans Boomgaard]]. She lived at [[Saint Peter Port]] on the island of [[Guernsey]] in the [[English Channel]]. She was also the first proven individual whose life spanned three centuries (18th to the 20th centuries).

==Family==
By Margaret's birth her family was already well-established on the island. Her father John Harvey was born in Cornwall in 1771 to John (1736-1778) and Margaret Ann Parker (d.1790). John Harvey was involved in merchant shipping and [[privateer]]ing, earning a great amount of wealth over the years. He married Elizabeth Harvey (''née'' Guille) when they were both 19. John died on 4 December 1820 at the age of 49, and  Elizabeth lived with her remaining children in a house called "Chaumière" ("The Cottage"), which he had bought in 1808.&lt;ref name="Priaulx"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.priaulxlibrary.co.uk/priaulx-library-new-details2.asp?ItemID=95 |title=The Harvey Family |work=Priaulx Library |date=2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022135751/http://www.priaulxlibrary.co.uk/priaulx-library-new-details2.asp?ItemID=95 |archivedate=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth died in 1871 at the age of 99.&lt;ref name="Priaulx" /&gt;

Together they had seven children:
* Margaret (1792-1903)
* John (1793-1865) - married Anne Sophia Grut (1802-1844) in 1826 and moved to Jersey, then England. They had a son named Thomas, who served in the militia and became a merchant.
* Elizabeth (1796-) - never married.
* Maria (1799) and Augusta (1801) had died as infants.
* Thomas (1803) emigrated to the United States.
* Augusta (1804) - married.
* Louisa (1805-1821)

==Early life and marriage==
Born Margaret Harvey on 18 May 1792, the eldest of seven children, most of her childhood was spent in [[Guernsey]]. Early in her life she survived a fall down the stairs, which left her [[concussion|concussed]] for three days.&lt;ref name="Priaulx" /&gt;

Neve, as she would become, could remember the turmoil that the [[French Revolution]] brought to Guernsey; at the time, her father was in command of the militia on the island. In 1807, at the age of 15, Neve set sail for [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]] with her father, but a storm caused the ship to land at [[Chesil Beach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geog.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/chambersofcommerce/guernsey-1808-9.pdf |title=Guernsey (Channel Islands) chamber of commerce, members in 1808-9.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Priaulx" /&gt;

She was educated in [[Bristol]], England, gaining an interest in literature and poetry. In 1815, she went to a "finishing school" in Brussels, becoming fluent in French and Italian and able to converse in German and Spanish. She would read the [[New Testament]] in Greek.&lt;ref name=BIB/&gt;{{rp|19}}

With her headmistress, she visited the battlefield of [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]], shortly after [[Battle of Waterloo|the battle]], once the corpses had been buried. There, Margaret picked up souvenirs which she showed to Prussian Field Marshal [[Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher|Blücher]] in London.&lt;ref name=BIB/&gt;{{rp|19}}

Neve met with [[Charles François Dumouriez]], a general of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], who dubbed her "la spirituelle".&lt;ref name="neve1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary|pages=10|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=1903-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Margaret married John Neve, born 1779, from [[Tenterden]], Kent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1903/04/19/101990032.pdf |title=The Late Mrs Neve |work=NY Times |date=19 April 1903}}&lt;/ref&gt; in St Peter Port (Town) church on 18 January 1823. On their honeymoon, they visited the Waterloo battlefield, 8 years after the battle.&lt;ref name="ST03"&gt;{{cite news |title=AGED 110 YEARS |publisher=The Straits Times |date=7 May 1903 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; She lived in England for 25 years of marriage, but when her husband died in 1849, she returned to Guernsey.&lt;ref name="neve2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Her Hundred-and-eighth Birthday|pages=3|work=[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]|date=1900-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had no children.

== Later life and death ==

The census for 1871 shows Margaret A. Neve (78) and her sister Elizabeth Harvey (73) living at 'Chaumière', Rouge Huis, St Peter Port, Guernsey.&lt;ref&gt;RG10-5765-222-1&lt;/ref&gt; Neve traveled abroad to various countries with Elizabeth.  Their last trip was in 1872, when Neve was 80, wherein they visited the Polish city of [[Krakow]] (then part of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]).&lt;ref name="neve2" /&gt;

On 18 May 1899, a reception was held at [[Rouge Huis]] to celebrate her 107th birthday and her entrance into her 108th year. The town council, [[jurat]]s, the officers of the staff, and about 250 of the leading residents attended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Unexampled Longevity. |pages=21 |work=[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]|date=1899-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her age, Margaret was found making [[marmalade]] the next morning by a reporter from ''[[The Times]]''. She was reported as never being ill until the age of 105, when she had the flu, followed by bronchitis at 108. At the age of 110, she climbed a tree to pluck an apple, explaining that they were much tastier when eaten straight from the tree.&lt;ref name="BIB"&gt;{{cite book |first=Glen |last=Balfour-Pau |title=Bagpipes in Babylon: A Lifetime in the Arab World and Beyond |ISBN=9781845111519 |publisher=I.B.Tauris, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}}

A newspaper report records that she enjoyed a glass and a half of old sherry at lunchtime, followed by a weak whiskey and water at supper. She was in the habit of always rising early and abstaining from eating and drinking between meal times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Oldest Woman in the World |publisher=arence and Richmond Examiner |date=19 February 1901 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to popular belief, she did not receive congratulations from [[Queen Victoria]] congratulating her for reaching her 110th birthday. However, the Harvey family (through Neve's niece Louisa) did exchange correspondence with the Royal Household, expressing gratitude for the signed photograph given to them on 4 May 1896 by the Queen.&lt;ref name="Priaulx" /&gt;

Neve died on 4 April 1903, a month before her 111th birthday. She reportedly repeated a [[Psalm]] in a loud voice the day before she died. Flags in Guernsey were lowered to half mast as a show of respect.&lt;ref name=BIB/&gt;{{rp|20}} She was one of the last few living people from the 18th century.

The '''name-letter effect''' is the tendency of people to prefer the [[letter (alphabet)|letters]] in their [[personal name|name]] over other letters in the [[alphabet]]. Whether [[Human subject research|subjects]] are asked to rank all letters of the alphabet, rate each of the letters, choose the letter they prefer out of a set of two, or pick a small set of letters they most prefer, on average people consistently like the letters in their own name the most. Crucially, subjects are not aware that they are choosing letters from their name.

Discovered in 1985 by the Belgian [[psychologist]] [[Jozef Nuttin]], the name-letter effect has been replicated in dozens of studies, involving subjects from over 15 countries, using four different alphabets. It holds across age and gender. People who changed their names many years ago tend to prefer the letters of both their current and original names over non-name letters. The effect is most prominent for [[initial]]s, but even when initials are excluded, the remaining letters of both [[given name|given]] and [[surname|family names]] still tend to be preferred over non-name letters.

Most people [[self-esteem|like themselves]]; the name is associated with the [[psychology of self|self]], and hence the letters of the name are preferred, despite the fact that they appear in many other words. People who [[self-hatred|do not like themselves]] tend not to exhibit the name-letter effect. A similar effect has been found for numbers related to [[birthday]]s: people tend to prefer the number signifying the day of the month on which they were born. Alternative explanations for the name-letter effect, such as [[mere-exposure effect|frequent exposure]] and early mastery, have been ruled out. In [[Psychological evaluation|psychological assessments]], the Name Letter Preference Task is widely used to estimate [[implicit self-esteem]].

There is some evidence that the effect has implications for real-life decisions. In the lab, people disproportionately favor [[brand]]s matching their initials. An analysis of a large database of charity donations revealed that a disproportionately large number of people donate to [[disaster relief]] following [[hurricane]]s with names sharing their initial letter (e.g. Kate and Kevin following [[Hurricane Katrina]]). Studies that investigate the impact of name-letter matching on bigger life decisions (where to live, whom to marry, which occupation to take on) are controversial.

== Background ==
Systematic interest in the letter preference began in 1959 with [[brand preference|brand-preference]] studies by researchers Mecherikoff and Horton. These tried to find the relative appeal of [[letter (alphabet)|letter]]s for use in package labels.{{sfn|Mecherikoff|Horton|1959||p=114}} In an extension of the studies, [[Human subject research|subjects]] were asked to rank the [[English alphabet]] by the pleasantness of the appearance of [[letter case|capital letter]]s. While there was not a great deal of agreement amongst the subjects (the [[coefficient of concordance|coefficients of concordance]] were low),{{sfn|Horton|Mecherikoff|1960|p=253}} a strong [[positive correlation]] was found between a letter's average rank and how [[frequency of letters|frequently]] it occurred as an initial letter of family names.{{sfn|Alluisi|Adams|1962|pp=124–125}}

[[Robert Zajonc]], a [[social psychologist]], published research in 1968 into preferences between pairs of [[word]]s (e.g. "on" or "off"): in the overwhelming majority of trials the preferred word was also the most common.{{sfn|Zajonc|1968|pp=6–7}} Zajonc also tested preferences for [[nonsense word]]s and found that people liked them the more they heard them.{{sfn|Zajonc|1968|p=24}} He interpreted these results as evidence that [[mere exposure effect|mere repeated exposure]] to a [[stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] is sufficient to enhance its attractiveness.{{sfn|Zajonc|1968|p=1}}

Around 1977, Belgian [[experimental psychologist]] [[Jozef Nuttin]] was driving on a highway looking at [[license plate]]s when he noticed that he preferred plates containing letters from his own name.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}} He wondered if people in general would prefer stimuli that are somehow connected to them; a "mere belongingness" as opposed to Zajonc's mere exposure.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}}{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=354}}

== First study ==
In his lab at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]], Nuttin [[Design of experiments|designed experiments]] to test the [[hypothesis]] that people place a higher value on letters that feature in their name.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}}{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=354}} It was crucial to the experimental design to rule out other factors, particularly mere exposure. If letters in a name are also letters that occur with higher frequency, then a preference for one's own letters might arise from the mere-exposure effect.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=354}}

To find an effect which ruled out mere exposure, Nuttin created a [[yoked control design]] in which two subjects evaluated the same letters separately. Some of the letters belonged to one subject's name, and some of the letters belonged to the other subject's name, while some were random. In this design, any difference in preference between subjects would have to be based on whether the letter occurred in their name.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|pp=354–355}}

For example, take the fictitious pair Irma Maes and Jef Jacobs as shown in the table. The first stimulus is A and U: the last letter of Irma's first name and a letter not in her name. The next stimulus is M and D: the penultimate letter from Irma's first name and a letter not part of her name. As can be seen in the table this is repeated for the remaining letters of Irma's first name. The letters of her last name then also appear in reverse order, and finally the letters of both of Jef's names. The shading in the table reveals the pattern hidden to subjects, who would have been told to circle their preferred letter of each pair as fast as possible without thinking.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|pp=354–356}}

In the first trial, 38 [[Flemish|Dutch-speaking]] local [[primary school|elementary school]] girls circled the letters they preferred in two yoked lists of letter pairs. A significant preference for the letters of one's own name over those of the other person was found.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=356}} The second experiment used 98 Dutch-speaking local university students, to see if more years of reading made a difference. Four other factors were varied: 1) either pairs or triads of letters; 2) encircling the preferred letter or crossing out the less preferred one(s); 3) the letters QXYZ, infrequent in Dutch, included or excluded; 4) own-name letters presented first or last.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=356}} All conditions gave a name-letter effect, with a stronger effect when QXYZ were included and the less preferred letter was crossed out.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=357}} No [[significant difference]] was found using family name rather than first name or both names.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=358}} While the effect was strongest for initials, subsequent [[data analysis]] revealed a significant effect even without the first and last initial.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=358}}

Nuttin concluded that the experiments showed that, independent of visual, [[psychoacoustics|acoustical]], [[applied aesthetics|aesthetic]], [[semantics|semantic]], and frequency characteristics, letters belonging to one's own first and family names are preferred above other letters.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=358}} He framed the effect in the context of [[narcissism]], [[Gestalt theory]] and [[awareness]], as reflected in the title of his 1985 article "Narcissism beyond Gestalt and awareness: the name letter effect", in which "beyond Gestalt" refers to the fact that subjects were not shown names, only letters in isolation, and "beyond awareness" to the fact that subjects did not realize that the letters of their own names were used.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|pp=358–359}} Nuttin claimed the effect he found was the first to go beyond Gestalt and awareness.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}}

== Second study ==
In 1987 Nuttin published his second study, describing experiments done in 1984 and 1985 with the help of Hilde Sas.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=381}}{{sfn|Sas|1986}} Because of the far-reaching implications of the name-letter effect for psychological theories, Nuttin found it wise to first test the effect's generality and robustness, before setting off on a research program aimed at understanding the underlying [[affect (psychology)|affective]] and [[cognitive psychology|cognitive]] processes at work. He wondered whether the effect would be found in all cultural and linguistic communities, or whether the first study revealed an effect due to some unknown idiosyncratic aspect of the Dutch language in Belgium.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=384}}

=== Method ===
Cross-lingual studies were performed at 13 European universities, using 12 different languages, viz. Dutch, [[English language|English]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Greek language|Greek]] (the only one with a non-[[Latin alphabet|Roman alphabet]]), [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Because the original yoked design did not lend itself well to long-distance research and standardization, it was replaced by a simpler, easier to replicate experimental design. Subjects were asked to mark the six capital letters they liked most in a randomized list containing all letters of the local alphabet, again without giving it much thought. They had to mark their first preference with 1, their second with 2, etc. The new method was first applied in Belgium. When results showed the name-letter effect at work again, it was copied in the other countries. A total of 2,047 subjects participated, all students.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|pp=385–386}}

=== Discussion ===
Across languages and letters, the average probability of a letter being chosen as one of the six preferred letters was 0.30 for name letters and 0.20 for other letters. The strongest effects were observed in the Norwegian and Finnish studies. In the Hungarian, Portuguese, and Italian studies the effect was present but not to a significant degree.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=390}} The effect was also found when only looking at letters in family names, as well as only first name letters. The name-letter effect emerged as very significant in all languages when only initials were considered.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=391}} There was a probability of 0.46 that initial letters were chosen amongst the top-six letters. Further analysis revealed that the overall name-letter effect is not simply due to initials: when excluding initials a name-letter effect was still found across all languages.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=392}}

Nuttin analyzed the data to see if there was a national-letter effect, but failed to find one. Norwegians did not favor the letter N (for Norge) more than people from other countries did, neither did the Hungarians favor the letter M (for [[Magyarország]]). This led Nuttin to conclude that individual ownership has affective consequences that are not observed for collective ownership.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|pp=396–397}}

The data also allowed for an investigation into whether visual prominence is an important factor in the name-letter effect. Cars in Austria and Hungary have a sticker displaying their nationality with a capital letter that does not match the country's name in the local language (A and H respectively). This did not have any impact on people in those countries liking those letters relatively more.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=397}}

As in the first study, the second one also included a task relating to disliking letters. Subjects were asked to select the six letters they liked the least. As before, merely having a letter in one's own name significantly reduced the chances of disliking it.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|pp=397–398}} This task revealed an asymmetry in the letter preference hierarchy. While there was a large consensus within each of the 12 languages as to which letters were least preferred, there was not much consensus at all around the most preferred letters.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=398}}{{efn-ua|This asymmetry is similar to what Czapiński found when analyzing school-trip companion preferences: much consensus as to who were the three least preferred students, but little in who were the three most preferred.{{sfn|Czapiński|1980|p=203}}}}

== Reception ==
In the light of how surprising the finding was, Nuttin hesitated for seven years before finally going public with it. He first mentioned it at a conference of the [[European Association of Social Psychology|European Association of Experimental Social Psychology]] in 1984,{{sfn|Nuttin|1984}} followed by the 1985 and 1987 articles referred to above. His work was met with widespread skepticism, as he had expected.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}} Loosen, a researcher at Nuttin's own university, called the name-letter effect "so strange that a down-to-earth researcher will spontaneously think of an [[artifact (error)|artifact]]".{{sfn|Loosen|1990|p=11}}{{efn-ua|Loosen's critique stemmed from misinterpreting Nuttin's experimental design. Loosen thought that subjects in the yoked experiments were randomly selected to form a pair. However, this had not been the case. Nuttin had selected pairs based on minimal overlap of syllables in the subjects' names.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}}}} Other researchers did not explicitly say that the effect was [[spurious relationship|spurious]], but they doubted its psychological relevance.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}} In the first five years after publication (1985–1989), Nuttin's 1985 article was cited only once and the effect was studied at only one other university ([[Ohio State University]], where Johnson replicated the effect using American students).{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}}{{sfn|Johnson|1986}}{{efn-ua|Because the effect is most profound for initials, Johnson had christened the effect the ''initial-letter effect''. Nuttin did not agree with this [[reductionism]], saying there is no need to create the illusion of two phenomena where there is only one.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=396}}}}

This all changed in 1995, when Greenwald and Banaji pointed out that Nuttin's work was relevant to indirect measurement of self-esteem, which Nuttin himself had actually already suggested.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}}{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|p=11}} After that the original study was cited 14 times in the five years between 1995 and 1999, 50 times between 2000 and 2004, 114 times between 2005 and 2009, and approximately 200 times between 2010 and 2014.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}} The name-letter effect is no longer disputed and Nuttin's work has been called "seminal" by Stieger, Voracek, and Formann in their 2012 meta-analysis of 44 publications on the effect.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=63}} Their meta-analysis found no trace of [[publication bias]].{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|pp=66–67}}

== Characteristics ==
In her 2014 [[meta-analysis]] of dozens of name-letter effect studies, Hoorens called the effect robust.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}} She noted robustness in:

* Scope: The name-letter effect is stronger for initials than for non-initials, but generally still holds even when excluding initials from analysis.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}}{{efn-ua| Koole, Smeets, van Knippenberg, and Dijksterhuis found an effect only for initials, not for letters in other positions.{{sfn|Koole|Smeets|van Knippenberg|Dijksterhuis|1999|p=111}}}}
* Gender: All but two studies found the effect equally strong for women and men.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}}{{efn-ua|The exceptions are a study by Albers, Rotteveel, and Dijksterhuis, and one by Stieger, Preyss, and Voracek.{{sfn|Albers|Rotteveel|Dijksterhuis|2009|p=63}}{{sfn|Stieger|Preyss|Voracek|2012|p=51}}}}{{efn-ua|Gender-role orientation, the extent to which an individual adopts and displays traits, attitudes, and behaviors normatively identified as male-typical or female-typical, may also play a part in the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Stieger|Burger|Schiller|Schulze|2014|p=358}} It can be measured by the gender initial-preference task, which requires participants to rate letters for their gender typicality. Men have been shown to rate their initial letters as more male-typical, whereas women rate their initials as more female-typical.{{sfn|Stieger|Burger|Schiller|Schulze|2014}}}}
* Age: The effect has been found in people ranging from school children to university students, middle-aged and old-aged adults.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}}{{efn-ua|The only known exception is a study by Kernis, Lakey, and Heppner.{{sfn|Kernis|Lakey|Heppner|2008|p=477}}}}
* Culture: Although there are many differences between [[Eastern culture|Eastern]] and [[Western cultures]], including as to how often family names or initials are used, the effect seems to apply across cultures.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}} In their study with subjects from Thailand, where the [[Thai name|family name]] is rarely used, Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun found a much stronger effect for first name than family name.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|p=204}} Kitayama and Karasawa found no special effect for [[Japanese name|initials in Japan]], where name initials are rarely used, but did find an overall name-letter effect.{{sfn|Kitayama|Karasawa|1997|p=740}}
* Language: 15 languages have been tested ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, [[Japanese language|Japanese]], Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, [[Thai language|Thai]]), covering four language families  ([[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Indo-Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]], [[Japonic]]) and five alphabets ([[Greek alphabet|Greek]], Roman, [[Cyrillic]], [[Devanagari]], [[Kana]]). In all cases a name-letter effect was found.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}}{{sfn|Kitayama|Karasawa|1997|p=740}}{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|p=184}}
* Time: In a study on preferences for initials, Stieger and LeBel found that people who had [[Maiden and married names|changed their name after marrying]] continued to show a preference for the initial of their abandoned birth name decades into their marriage. Also, subjects who had been married less than two years already showed a name-letter effect for their new last name initial.{{sfn|Stieger|LeBel|2012|p=10}}

== Explanations ==
Various explanations for the name-letter effect have been explored. Several explanations which seemed plausible at first have since been rejected.

=== Disproved causes ===

==== Mere exposure ====
People may simply like most what they see most. Letters that appear more frequently in everyday usage also occur more often in people's names. Forer, in 1940, and Alluisi and Adams, in 1962, found a positive correlation between the frequency of occurrence of letters and [[phoneme]]s and how attractive they were judged to be.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|1993|p=181}}{{sfn|Forer|1940|p=589}}{{sfn|Alluisi|Adams|1962|p=123}} Zajonc extended these studies, using foreign symbols and controlling the number of exposures. This led him to formulate the mere-exposure hypothesis: the more you see something, the more you like it.{{sfn|Zajonc|1980|p=151}} Nuttin's original study showed that mere exposure can not be the cause of the name-letter effect, as letters with equal frequency were evaluated differently by people who had the letter in their names and those who did not.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}}{{efn-ua|Nuttin made the assumption that for any given letter, total exposure has been roughly the same for each subject. That is, an adult's name is read or written infrequently compared to all other words.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}} Other researchers agreed; Greenwald and Banaji spoke of "reaching an asymptote".{{sfn|Kitayama|Karasawa|1997|p=740}}}} He also found that whereas the letter B is of low frequency in French and the letter Q of medium frequency, in experiments with French speakers the B was among the most highly liked letters and the Q was among the least liked. Similarly, in Polish the Y is a medium frequency letter, yet was still among the least preferred letters.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=399}} In each of the languages, the least frequent letters were over-represented in the set of least preferred letters, whereas the most preferred letters were rarely the highest frequency letters. The exposure counts in the lab studies done by Zajonc (20 to 25 times) were minuscule compared to real-life observation counts of any letter, which also caused Nuttin to cast doubt on whether Zajonc's theory could hold true in the real world.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|pp=398–400}}

==== Subjective frequency ====
Subjective frequency is how frequently subjects {{em|think}} a stimulus appears. Name letters may be noticed more and, consequently, assumed to occur more frequently than other letters. Early research into the impact of exposure showed that differences in subjective frequency yielded different results even when the {{em|actual}} frequency was identical.{{sfn|Matlin|1971|p=295}} Hoorens and Nuttin tested whether subjective frequency could be an explanation for the name-letter effect by asking subjects to rank-order the entire alphabet twice, once according to their letter preference and once according to estimated letter frequency. Subjects indeed significantly overestimated the frequency of letters in their names, although there was no significant positive correlation between the overestimation of frequency and the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|1993|p=177}} The researchers also asked subjects to rate how much they liked their own name. Subjects who liked their name had a stronger name-letter effect than those who did not like their name, but they did not overestimate the frequency of own-name letters more than subjects who did not like their names. Hoorens and Nuttin concluded that there is no support for the subjective frequency hypothesis.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|1993|p=177}}

==== Evaluative conditioning ====
[[Evaluative conditioning]] suggests that if the name is liked then the name letters will be liked too. This would occur through repeated visual association of the name letters with the name. Martin and Levey defined evaluative conditioning as a variation of [[classical conditioning]] in which we come to like or dislike something through an association.{{sfn|Martin|Levey|1987|p=69}} Given the observation that our own name stands out among others as quite an attractive stimulus, as Cherry found in the [[cocktail party effect]], it could be that the name-letter effect results from evaluative conditioning.{{sfn|Feys|1995|p=560}}{{sfn|Mack|Rock|1998|p=18}} Feys set up a controlled study with Flemish subjects, pairing unfamiliar symbols (Japanese [[kanji]]) with subjects' own names, and with other names. He found that there was no difference in how much subjects liked the kanji symbol representing their own name or other names. He concluded that evaluative conditioning is not the primary cause of the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Feys|1995|p=560}}

==== Subjective ownership ====
Subjective ownership would occur if subjects knowingly chose the letters from their own name. Nuttin ruled out a conscious response strategy in tests. Despite being given a monetary reward and unlimited time, none of the subjects of his original study were able to find a pattern in the stimulus lists, ruling out the possibility that they knew their own name-letters were there.{{sfn|Hoorens|1990|p=29}}

==== Mastery pleasure ====
The letters first learned by a child, commonly their own name,{{sfn|Treiman|Broderick|1998|p=112}} may come to have lasting positive associations.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=366}} Hoorens and Todorova tested this by looking for a name-letter effect in bilingual subjects where their [[first language|mother tongue]] alphabet was Cyrillic and their foreign-language alphabet Roman.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=365}} Because learning a foreign language at a later age does not typically involve extra attention given to name letters, there should be no name-letter effect in the foreign-language alphabet, only in the first-language alphabet.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=366}} Results of a study with 100 Bulgarian subjects who at a later age learned English, German, French or Spanish revealed a name-letter effect for the Roman alphabet as well as for Cyrillic.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=367}}{{efn-ua|The effect was not due to the two alphabets sharing letters. It was found for common letters with identical pronunciation (AEKMT), common letters with different pronunciation (BCFPYU), and Roman capitals not appearing in Cyrillic (DFGIJNRVWZ).{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=367}}}} The researchers concluded mastery pleasure is not the principal cause of the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=368}} In a follow-up study Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun tested the strength of the name-letter effect among elementary-school children, in a cross-sectional experimental design involving Flemish and Hungarian second, fourth, and sixth graders. Instead of finding the name-effect to decrease with age as might be expected, they found it increased, thus proving that mastery pleasure is not the principal cause.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|p=190}}{{efn-ua|Other studies have since also found the effect to increase over age, for instance, Corenblum and Armstrong in their study of [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Native Canadian]] children.{{sfn|Corenblum|Armstrong|2012|p=130}}}} They also investigated name-letter effects in bilingual Thai subjects, some of whom had learned the English alphabet at the same time as the Thai alphabet, and others who had learned it later.{{efn-ua|Only Thai [[consonant]]s were presented as stimuli. Thai [[vowel]]s can not be used in isolation as their sound depends on their context.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|p=192}}}} They found that the time at which students had learned the second alphabet made no difference in the strength of the name-letter effect, thereby ruling out mastery pleasure as a co-determinant.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|pp=196–201}}

=== Probable cause ===
The effect is thought to arise from unconscious, automatic processes of self-evaluation, with different research groups coming at it from two different angles.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}}{{sfn|Koole|2007|p=603}}

==== Mere ownership ====
Nuttin frames the cause in terms of ownership, which has roots in [[behavioral economics|economic psychology]]. The [[endowment effect]] has found that people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them.{{sfn|Kahneman|Knetsch|Thaler|1991|p=193}}{{sfn|Beggan|1992|p=229}} Nuttin puts the name-letter effect down to people automatically liking and valuing anything that is connected to them. As such, the name-letter effect is just one example of a more general [[mere ownership effect|mere-ownership effect]].{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}} In which case, various verifiable predictions follow.

* Most people should like their name. Those that do not should not like their name letters. Hoorens and Nuttin tested this and found that most people rated their name relatively highly. They also found that subjects who evaluated their own name relatively positively liked their name letters more than subjects who evaluated their own name negatively.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|1993|pp=177–200}}
* Bilinguals using two different alphabets should demonstrate a name-letter effect in both alphabets. A weaker effect should be found in the second alphabet, as names in second alphabets are likely to be less connected to the self. Hoorens and Todorova found that bilinguals with a tendency to like their name letters in Cyrillic also had a tendency to like their name letters in the Roman alphabet. The effect was found to be weaker in the second alphabet.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=367}} This was replicated in a Thai-English study by Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|pp=183–184}}
* Similar effects should be found for other attributes connected to the self, such as the numbers of one's birthday. Nickell, Pederson, and Rossow found that people like the numbers representing the month and year of their birth more. They also found that subjects liked the year of their graduation more.{{sfn|Nickell|Pederson|Rossow|2003|pp=161–163}} In a study of Japanese students, Kitayama and Karasawa found a strong [[birthday-number effect]] for the day of the month, especially for numbers higher than 12. The higher numbers may be more uniquely associated with birthdays, whereas lower numbers could be more saturated with other meanings.{{sfn|Kitayama|Karasawa|1997|p=740}}

==== Implicit self-esteem ====
Another group of researchers has framed the cause in terms of [[social psychology]], specifically the [[self-esteem]] theory. Beginning with [[Anthony Greenwald|Greenwald]] and Banaji in 1995, this group states that the name-letter effect results from [[implicit self-esteem]], a person's tendency to evaluate him or herself positively in a spontaneous, automatic, or unconscious manner.{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|pp=4, 10–11}}{{sfn|Koole|2007|p=603}} Most people like themselves.{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|p=10}} The halo effect of self-esteem spreads to any attributes associated with the self, including the name and its letters.{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|pp=10–11}} As early as 1926 Syz discovered that a person's own name is special compared to others, eliciting physical responses measurable on the skin.{{sfn|Syz|1926|pp=119–126}} It is thought that when a person recognizes the letters in his or her name, that person experiences positive feelings of implicit self-esteem. These positive feelings induce subjects to unknowingly select the letters of their own name, producing the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Koole|Pelham|2003|p=108}}

* To be an automatic process, the effect should, for each specific person, be fairly stable over time. Koole, [[Ap Dijksterhuis|Dijksterhuis]] and van Knippenberg investigated this by asking Dutch students to rate each letter of the alphabet, together with some filler questions for distraction, twice within a four-week period. They found that preferences for name letters did not significantly change between the first and second rating.{{sfn|Koole|Dijksterhuis|van Knippenberg|2001|pp=672–673}} Hoorens and colleagues also found that ratings remained stable when 164 subjects rated letters seven days in a row.{{sfn|Hoorens|Takano|Franck|Roberts|2015|p=910}}
* To be an automatic process, the effect should, like other automatic processes involving preferences, be influenced by deliberate thought. Multiple studies have shown that thinking about feelings inhibits automatic responding.{{sfn|Koole|Dijksterhuis|van Knippenberg|2001|p=673}}{{sfn|Wilson|Dunn|Kraft|Lisle|1989|p=330}} Koole, Dijksterhuis, and van Knippenberg had subjects give their preferences for letters and numbers 1 to 50. They made half of them explain their preferences. They found a name-letter effect and birthday-number effect in those subjects asked to answer without thinking, but no effects in those asked to think. This points to the effect being the result of an automatic process.{{sfn|Koole|Dijksterhuis|van Knippenberg|2001|pp=674–676}}
* Unconscious [[Emotional self-regulation|self-regulation]] has been found to increase under psychological threat. For the effect to be one of unconscious self-regulation it too should increase under threat. Jones, Pelham, Mirenberg, and Hetts found that when people who were high in explicit self-esteem were exposed to a psychological threat, they showed exaggerated name-letter preferences. In contrast, low self-esteem participants showed evidence of the opposite tendency.{{sfn|Jones|Pelham|Mirenberg|Hetts|2002|p=170}} Komori and Murata later replicated this response to threat with Japanese bilinguals who were asked to select preferred letters of the English alphabet.{{sfn|Komori|Murata|2008|p=109}}
* If the effect is an automatic process, then the subliminal use of name letters should influence other preferences. Wentura, Kulfanek, and Greve investigated this by the use of a [[priming (psychology)|priming]] technique. They showed subjects the first and last initials of their own name or of a yoked subject's name, too briefly to be noticed. This was immediately followed by words such as "honest" and "lonely". Subjects had to quickly identify the word they had seen as positive or negative. It was found that subjects categorized positive words more quickly if they were first primed with their own initials. There was no effect for negative words. The effects of initial-letter priming were especially strong for subjects with high levels of explicit self-esteem.{{sfn|Wentura|Kulfanek|Greve|2001|p=657}}{{sfn|Koole|Pelham|2003|pp=101–102}}
* If there is a halo effect spreading to anything connected to the self, then people in relationships should like the name letters of their partners more than other letters. LeBel and Campbell tested this and found a name-letter effect for initials of subjects' partners.{{sfn|LeBel|Campbell|2009|p=1293}} DeHart, Pelham, Fiedorowicz, Carvallo, and Gabriel concluded that the effect applies to parent-child, sibling and friendship relationships as well.{{sfn|DeHart|Pelham|Fiedorowicz|Carvallo|2011|p=127}}

== Application ==
In [[Psychological evaluation|psychological assessments]], the name-letter effect has been exploited to measure self-esteem.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=64}} There are two types of self-esteem: explicit self-esteem (a person's deliberate and conscious evaluation of themselves) and implicit self-esteem.{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|pp=4, 10–11}} Because by definition implicit self-esteem is not accessible to [[introspection]], measures of it do not rely on direct self-reports but on the degree to which objects associated with the self generate positive versus negative thoughts.{{sfn|Spalding|Hardin|1999|p=535}}{{sfn|Krizan|Suls|2008|p=522}}

The Letter Preference Task is the second-most popular method to measure implicit self-esteem, surpassed only by the [[Implicit-association test|Implicit Association Test]].{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}} The task has also been called the Name Letter Preference Task, Name-Letter-Ratings Measure, and Initial Preference Task.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=63}}{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=233}} There is no standard method for applying the task. The most commonly used one is a letter rating task, which involves having participants judge all the letters of the alphabet. Even within this method there are variations in the instructions (how much you like the letters or how attractive you find them), in the [[Likert scale|rating scales]] (five-point, seven-point, or nine-point), in the order of the letters (random or alphabetical), and in data collection (paper-and-pencil or computer-based).{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}}

There is no standard [[algorithm]] for calculating implicit self-esteem. At least six algorithms are in use.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=71}} In their meta-analysis of the name-letter effect, Stieger, Voracek, and Formann recommend using the [[ipsative|ipsatized]] double-correction algorithm (the so-called "I-algorithm"), as originally recommended and named by LeBel and Gawronski{{sfn|LeBel|Gawronski|2009|p=101}}).{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=71}} In her meta-analysis, Hoorens does not recommend a specific algorithm as little is known about how name-letter preference scores obtained from different algorithms relate to the most important psychometric quality of all, [[content validity|validity]].{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=244}} The algorithms are typically applied to initials only, but can be used for all name letters.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}}

Stieger, Voracek, and Formann recommend that the task be administered twice, that the effects be calculated separately for first-name initial and last-name initial, that the task be accompanied with the birthday-number task, and that the instructions focus on liking rather than attractiveness.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=76}} They suggest it may be useful to use not just initials but all name letters for measuring implicit self-esteem, something which Hoorens says is her most important recommendation.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=76}}{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=248}} The Letter Preference Task has been used to measure implicit self-esteem in contexts as diverse as [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[physical health]], [[social acceptance]], [[unrealistic optimism]], feedback sensitivity, [[Emotional self-regulation|self-regulation]], and [[defensiveness]].{{sfn|LeBel|Gawronski|2009|p=86}}

== Wider implications ==
Researchers have looked for wider implications of the name-letter effect on preferences, both inside and outside the lab.

=== In the lab ===
In controlled studies in the lab, Hodson and Olson tried to find evidence of people liking everyday things (e.g. foods, animals) that matched their name initials. No evidence was found, neither for a between-subjects effect (e.g. Judy did not like things starting with J, such as jam, more than Doug liked things starting with J), nor for a within-individuals effect (e.g. Judy did not like jam more than honey).{{sfn|Hodson|Olson|2005|p=1099}}&amp;nbsp;The researchers did discover a small but reliable effect of initials on brand-name preferences within individuals (e.g. Hank did like&amp;nbsp;Honda&amp;nbsp;more than non-matching brands).{{sfn|Hodson|Olson|2005|p=1108}}&amp;nbsp;They speculated that brand names are more likely to communicate identity to others than other everyday things.{{sfn|Hodson|Olson|2005|p=1109}}&amp;nbsp;Stieger extended this research by looking at buying preferences for product names. He found that people were disproportionately more likely to buy products matching their initials.{{sfn|Stieger|2010|p=1089}}&amp;nbsp;The effect mainly occurred for big brands. No correlation was found between the strength of an individual's name-letter effect and the strength of his or her name-letter-branding effect.{{sfn|Stieger|2010|p=1095}}

Wiebenga and Fennis investigated whether the use of the&amp;nbsp;[[personal pronoun]]s&amp;nbsp;"I" and "my" in branding also had an effect on preferences, given the way these pronouns link to the self. They found that brand names with a generic self-referencing pronoun (e.g. [[iPhone]], [[Myspace]]) were evaluated more positively than non-self-referencing brand names (e.g.&amp;nbsp;[[Xbox]]). The effect behaved like the name-letter effect: when the self was put under threat the effect became stronger, and it disappeared for people with negative self-evaluations.{{sfn|Wiebenga|Fennis|2012|p=733}}

A study by Polman, Pollmann, and Poehlman found that sharing initials with members in a group can increase the quality of group work. In a study of&amp;nbsp;[[undergraduate]]&amp;nbsp;students they found that groups sharing initials performed better than groups that did not. Groups that had a higher proportion of shared initials exceeded groups with a lower proportion of shared initials.{{sfn|Polman|Pollmann|Poehlman|2013}}

=== Outside the lab ===
==== Controversial studies ====
Researchers have looked for evidence of the driving force behind the name-letter effect outside the lab. A body of controversial research under the umbrella of&amp;nbsp;[[implicit egotism]], starting with Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones, has investigated whether people unknowingly make life decisions based on their name letters or name.{{sfn|Pelham|Mirenberg|Jones|2002|p=479}}{{sfn|Pelham|Carvallo|2015|p=692}}{{sfn|Jones|Pelham|Carvallo|Mirenberg|2004|p=665}} &amp;nbsp;Sceptics say that to claim that a name or name letters influences life decisions is an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary evidence.{{sfn|Danesi|2012|p=84}}

Simonsohn urged researchers to look hard for confounding variables in field data analysis. An example of a confounding variable is baby-name popularity. This has fluctuated significantly over the decades. Simonsohn found that although Walter and Dennis are of near-identical popularity in a large sample of US first names of living people, Walter is a relatively old-fashioned name. He suggested that when Pelham et al. found a disproportionately high number of dentists whose name started with the letters "Den" compared to with "Wal", they had overlooked that people named Walter would tend to be old, and more likely to be retired. Baby-name fluctuation seemed a better explanation for disproportionately more "Den" dentists than "Wal" than implicit egotism.{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011a|p=22–23}}&amp;nbsp;Using both a different data set ([[Twitter]]&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[Google+]]&amp;nbsp;accounts) and a different statistical analysis, Kooti, Magno, and Weber found no evidence of people disproportionately having a job matching their name initials.{{sfn| Kooti|Magno|Weber|2014|p=216}}{{efn-ua|Overlooking a cohort confound was also the problem with controversial research that tied initials to death. Christenfeld, Phillips, and Glynn concluded that people who have positive [[monogram]]s (e.g. ACE or VIP) live significantly longer than those with negative initials (e.g. PIG or DIE). This conclusion was based on analysis of thousands of California death certificates between 1969 and 1995.{{sfn|Christenfeld|Phillips|Glynn|1999|p=241}} Morrison and Smith subsequently pointed out that this was an artefact of grouping data by age at death. Frequency of initials changing over time could be a confounding variable. When they grouped the same data by birth year, they found no statistically significant relationship between initials and longevity.{{sfn|Morrison|Smith|2005|p=820}} Similarly, Smith found statistical errors had led Abel and Kruger wrongly to conclude that [[Major League Baseball]] players whose names have positive initials live longer than players with negative initials.{{sfn|Smith|2011|p=211}}{{sfn|Abel|Kruger|2007|p=179}}}}

Dyjas, Grasman, Wetzels, van der Maas, and Wagenmakers criticized the method Pelham et al. used in their analysis of archives of deaths in 23 "Saint cities" in the US, such as&amp;nbsp;[[St. Louis]]&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]]. Whereas Pelham et al. pooled all data together and concluded that people gravitate towards cities matching their first name (e.g. Louis or Paul), Dyjas et al. used&amp;nbsp;[[Bayesian network|Bayesian hierarchical modelling]]&amp;nbsp;to show that there are several cities where the opposite happens, people moving away from their name Saint city. They concluded that there is no evidence for an overall effect.{{sfn|Dyjas|Grasman|Wetzels|van der Maas|2012|pp=7–10}}&amp;nbsp;A different set of cities containing 30 surnames, such as&amp;nbsp;[[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] and [[Johnson City, Tennessee|Johnson City]], did reveal a disproportionately large number of deceased people with city–surname matches.{{sfn|Dyjas|Grasman|Wetzels|van der Maas|2012|pp=8–9}} Dyjas et al. disputed that people gravitate towards cities of their surname, but instead cited Simonsohn's argument that many descendants of founders of these cities may never have moved away, a case of reverse causality.{{sfn|Dyjas|Grasman|Wetzels|van der Maas|2012|p=9}}{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011a|p=15}}

Simonsohn also raised the possibility of reverse causality in the case of Anseel and Duyck's analysis of a large data set consisting of Belgians' last names and the companies they work for. Anseel and Duyck concluded that people tend to choose to work for companies that match their initial.{{sfn|Anseel|Duyck|2008|p=1059}}&amp;nbsp;But Simonsohn suspected that, like&amp;nbsp;[[Walt Disney]] working for [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], many people work for companies named after themselves or a family member. When he controlled for reverse causality in a large US data set, he could not see any evidence for people choosing to work for companies matching their initial.{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011b|p=1087}}

A few controversial studies have linked performance to initials. However, McCullough and Williams found no evidence of a name-letter effect for the letter 'K' in baseball players [[strikeout|striking out]] (shown on the scoreboard with a 'K'), despite an earlier study by Nelson and Simmons suggesting there was.{{sfn|McCullough|Williams |2010|p=881}}{{sfn|Nelson|Simmons|2007|p=1106}} Nelson and Simmons also found that students with first name initials C or D get lower [[Academic grading in the United States|grades]] than others with initials A or B.{{sfn|Nelson|Simmons|2007|p=1106}}&amp;nbsp;Again, McCullough and Williams criticized the statistical analysis used and found no evidence to support such a relation.{{sfn|McCullough|Williams|2011|p=340}}

In response to Simonsohn's critical analyses of their earlier methods, Pelham and Carvallo published a new study in 2015, describing how they now controlled for gender, ethnicity, and education confounds. In one study they looked at census data and concluded that men disproportionately worked in eleven occupations that matched their surnames, for example, Baker, Carpenter, and Farmer, something the&amp;nbsp;''[[New Scientist]]''&amp;nbsp;has coined&amp;nbsp;[[nominative determinism]].{{sfn|Pelham|Carvallo|2015|p=692}}{{sfn|Feedback|1994}} Voracek, Rieder, Stieger, and Swami investigated which way the arrow of causality points when it comes to names influencing choice of occupation. They reported that today's Smiths still tend to have the physical capabilities of their ancestors who were [[metalsmith|smiths]]. In the researchers' view a genetic-social hypothesis appeared more viable than the hypothesis of implicit egotism effects.{{sfn|Voracek|Rieder|Stieger|Swami|2015}}

==== Undisputed studies ====
[[File:Hurricane Katrina August 28 2005 NASA.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Satellite image of a hurricane|upright|[[Hurricane Katrina]]: people with the initial K especially donated to the disaster relief.]]
Research by Chandler, Griffin, and Sorensen into a link between letter names and donations has been widely accepted. They analyzed the records of disaster relief donations after seven hurricanes (among others, [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]], [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]] and [[Hurricane Mitch|Mitch]]). They found that people who shared an initial with the hurricane were overrepresented as donors. They concluded that people want to overcome some of the negative feelings associated with the shared name and thus donate.{{sfn|Chandler|Griffin|Sorensen|2008|pp=404–410}}{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011a|pp=44–45}}&amp;nbsp;Simonsohn suggested that implicit egotism only applies to cases where people are nearly indifferent between options, and therefore it would not apply to major decisions such as career choices, but would to low-stakes decisions such as choosing a charity.{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011a|p=46}}

According to the legend, a group of settlers led by a figure named Nunong Karugtong crossed the Sierra Madre Mountains from somewhere in what is now Rizal Province in search of better living conditions.  After examining multiple sites in what is now the Municipality of Infanta, they eventually settled on a site near the Bantilan River, where the discovery of a huge Yam root convinced them that the site was ideal for settlement.  This eventually became the site of the settlement which European colonizers would call "Binangonan de Lampon," which in turn would evolve into the Municipality of Infanta.&lt;ref name="infantagov"/&gt;

[[File:Battle of Poitiers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Battle of Poitiers]] 1356. The oriflamme can be seen on the top left.]]

The '''Oriflamme''' (from Latin ''aurea flamma'', "golden flame") was the [[battle standard]] of the [[King of France]] in the Middle Ages. It was originally the sacred banner of the [[Abbey of St. Denis]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xenophongroup.com/montjoie/orifl-fa.htm Oriflamme Society]&lt;/ref&gt; a monastery near Paris. When the oriflamme was raised in battle by the French royalty during the Middle Ages, most notably during the [[Hundred Years War]], no prisoners were to be taken until it was lowered. Through this tactic they hoped to strike fear into the hearts of the enemy, especially the nobles, who could usually expect to be taken alive for ransom during such military encounters.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Southey (1841) '' Joan of Arc: a poem'', Longman et autres. [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TPRAhDvWDrwC&amp;pg=PA280&amp;lpg=PA280&amp;dq=oriflamme+no+quarter+given&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=k7Nfv2vzz-&amp;sig=v2VEcfsGqIA6hlWsT62p_Jgrodg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAmoVChMIo6Du2dmMxwIVBL1yCh38WwSD#v=onepage&amp;q=oriflamme%20no%20quarter%20given&amp;f=false p. 280]&lt;/ref&gt;

In French, the term "''oriflamme''" has come to mean any banner with pointed ends; by association with the form of the original.

==Legendary origin==

The  Oriflamme was mentioned in the eleventh-century ballad the ''[[Chanson de Roland]]'' (vv. 3093-5) as a royal banner, first called ''Romaine'' and then ''Montjoie''.&lt;ref name=CathEncy/&gt; According to legend, [[Charlemagne]] carried it to the Holy Land in response to a prophecy regarding a knight possessing a golden lance, from which flames would burn and drive out the [[Saracens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Distant Mirror |last=Tuchman |first=Barbara |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1978|publisher=Penguin |location= |isbn=0140054073 |page=148 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the ''lance'' was originally the important object, with the banner simply a decoration, but this changed over time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/oriflamm.htm Heraldica.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Oriflamme was first used by [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]] in 1124 and was last flown in battle at Agincourt in 1415,&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Barber (1984) ''The Penguin guide to medieval Europe'', Penguin Books. [https://books.google.com/books?id=A9MYAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Oriflamme+Agincourt+no+quarter&amp;dq=Oriflamme+Agincourt+no+quarter&amp;pgis=1 p. 224]&lt;/ref&gt; though a version of it remained in the Abbey of St. Denis until the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Complete Book of Heraldry|last=Slater |first=Stephen |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=Hermes House |location= |isbn=1846819601 |page= 30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis VI replaced the earlier banner of Saint Martin with the oriflamme of the Abbey of St. Denis, which floated about the tomb of St. Denis and was said to have been given to the abbey by king Dagobert.
Until the 12th century the standard-bearer was the [[Comte de Vexin]], who, as vowed to St. Denis, was the temporal defender of the abbey. Louis VI, having acquired Vexin, became standard-bearer; as soon as war began, Louis VI received Communion at St. Denis and took the standard from the tomb of the saint to carry it to the combat.

It is recorded as having been carried at the following battles/campaigns:{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

== Appearance ==
The banner was red or orange-red silk and flown from a gilded lance.&lt;ref&gt;Slater (2002), p.33&lt;/ref&gt; According to legend, its colour stems from it being dipped in the blood of the recently beheaded [[Denis|St. Denis]].

The surviving descriptions of the Oriflamme are in Guillaume le Breton (thirteenth century), in the "Chronicle of Flanders" (fourteenth century), in the "Registra Delphinalia" (1456) and in the inventory of the treasury of St. Denis (1536). They show that the primitive Oriflamme was succeeded in the course of the centuries by newer Oriflammes which bore little resemblance to one another except for their colour.&lt;ref name=CathEncy&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Oriflamme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance on the battlefield ==
When the Oriflamme was displayed on the battlefield it indicated that [[no quarter]]
was to be given, its red colour being symbolic of cruelty and ferocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The laws of War in the late Middle Ages |last=Keen |first=Maurice |authorlink=Maurice Keen |coauthors= |year=1965 |publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul |location= London|isbn= |page= |pages= 105–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the azure ground (from the blue cope of [[Martin of Tours|St. Martin of Tours]]) strewn with gold [[fleur-de-lis]] remained the symbol of royalty until the 15th century, the Oriflamme became the royal battle standard of the King of France, and it was carried at the head of the king's forces when they met another army in battle. In the fifteenth century, the fleur-de-lis on the white flag of [[Joan of Arc]] became the new royal standard replacing both the symbol of royalty and the Oriflamme on the battle field.&lt;ref name=CathEncy/&gt;&lt;!--cited for last sentence--&gt;

==Porte oriflamme==
The bearer of the standard, the ''porte-oriflamme'', became an [[Great Officers of the Crown of France|office]] (like that of [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] or [[Constable of France|Constable]]) and a great honour, as it was an important and very dangerous job to take charge of such a visible symbol in battle.  If things went badly, the bearer was expected to die rather than relinquish his charge.

Froissart vividly describes ''porte-oriflamme'' Geoffroi de Charny's fall at the side of his king at the Battle of Poitiers in this passage:  &lt;blockquote&gt;“There Sir Geoffroi de Charny fought gallantly near the king (note: and his fourteen-year-old son). The whole press and cry of battle were upon him because he was carrying the king’s sovereign banner [the Oriflamme]. He also had before him his own banner, gules, three escutcheons argent. So many English and Gascons came around him from all sides that they cracked open the king’s battle formation and smashed it; there were so many English and Gascons that at least five of these men at arms attacked one [French] gentleman. Sir Geoffroi de Charny was killed with the banner of France in his hand, as other French banners fell to earth.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Jean Froissart; trans Geoffrey Brereton, ''Chronicles'' ( Penguin Books, Harmondsworth, UK, 1978), p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== The Oriflamme in literature ==
The 19th-century poet [[Robert Southey]] refers to the Oriflamme and its reputation in his poem ''Joan of Arc''{{cquote|
:::::"Dark-minded man!"
:The Maid of Orleans answered, "to act well
:Brings with itself an ample recompense.
:I have not reared the oriflamme of death —
:Now God forbid! The banner of the Lord
:Is this; and, come what will, me it behooves,
:Mindful of Him whose minister I am,
:To spare the fallen foe: that gracious God
:Sends me a messenger of mercy forth,
:Sends me to save this ravaged realm of France,
:To England friendly as to all the world;
:Only to those an enemy, whose lust
:Of sway makes them the enemies of man."
||[Robert Southey, ''Joan of Arc. Book VIII''&lt;ref&gt;Robert Southey, ''The Poetical Works of Robert Southey: With a Memoir of the Author'', in X Volumes, Volume I,
Boston. Little Brown and Company, New York, 1860 pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zustUDvosyMC&amp;pg=PA307#PPA181,M1 181], [https://books.google.com/books?id=zustUDvosyMC&amp;pg=PA307 307]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Activism ==
jones has been an activist for social change since the 1970s.&lt;ref name="ar-conference"&gt;{{cite web|title=pattrice jones - International Animal Rights Conference|url=http://www.ar-conference.com/2013/pattrice_jones.php|website=International Animal Rights Conference|accessdate=June 13, 2016|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="real-interview " /&gt; She stopped eating meat when she was 15, the same year that she came out as a [[lesbian]]. She later became [[vegan]], as she felt cows and hens were being sexually exploited for their milk and eggs.&lt;ref name="real-interview " /&gt;

In the year 2000, jones and her partner Miriam Jones founded Eastern Shore Sanctuary in rural [[Maryland]].&lt;ref name="talking-animals" /&gt;&lt;ref name="real-interview " /&gt; The sanctuary was relocated to Vermont in 2009, and later renamed to VINE ("Veganism Is the Next Evolution") Sanctuary.&lt;ref name="talking-animals" /&gt;&lt;ref name="about-vine" /&gt;

Around 2002–2003, jones was attributed to be the main organiser&lt;ref name="pjones_led_GHA" /&gt; of the ''Global Hunger Alliance'' (GHA), an international network of several activist organisations that was coordinated in preparation for the [[World Food Summit#2002 World Food Summit|2002 World Food Summit]].&lt;ref name="GHA_about_201108" /&gt; The GHA networked with 90 other "supportive" organisations from around the world,&lt;ref name="AHershaft" /&gt; including [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]], [[Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine]] and [[Uncaged Campaigns]].&lt;ref name="GHA_partners_URLs" /&gt;

In 2012, jones became involved in a battle over the lives of Bill and Lou, two [[oxen]] at [[Green Mountain College]] in [[Poultney, Vermont]]. After one of the oxen, Lou, became injured, the school decided to slaughter both and serve them as food in the dining hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bidgood|first1=Jess|title=Oxen's Fate Is Embattled as the Abattoir Awaits|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/29/us/oxens-possible-slaughter-prompts-fight-in-vermont.html|website=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=June 14, 2016|date=October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students and animal rights advocates protested, and jones offered the oxen a home at VINE Sanctuary. The college ultimately euthanized Lou. The [[Green Mountain College#Oxen-slaughtering controversy|controversy]] made national headlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bidgood|first1=Jess|title=A Casualty Amid Battle to Save College Oxen|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/13/us/vermont-college-euthanizes-one-ox-spares-another.html|website=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=June 13, 2016|date=November 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; jones wrote about the events in her book, ''The Oxen at the Intersection.''&lt;ref name="real-interview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="talking-animals" /&gt;

== Writing and lecturing ==

jones writes and lectures about animal rights from an [[intersectional]] approach,&lt;ref name="ar-conference" /&gt; connecting [[speciesism]] with [[racism]], [[sexism]], [[homophobia]], and [[transphobia]].&lt;ref name="autostraddle"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jamie|title=Queering the Politics of Animal Rights with VINE Sanctuary|url=http://www.autostraddle.com/queering-the-politics-of-animal-rights-with-vine-sanctuary-194804/|website=[[Autostraddle]]|accessdate=June 13, 2016|date=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''people''' is a plurality of [[person]]s considered as a whole, as is the case with an [[ethnic group]] or [[nation]]. Collectively, for example, the contemporary [[Frisians]] and [[Danes]] are two related [[Germanic peoples]], while various [[Middle East]]ern ethnic groups are often linguistically categorized as [[Semitic people]]s.

== In politics ==
{{Main article|Commoner}}
[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' by [[Eugène Delacroix]]]]

Various [[sovereign state|states]] govern, or claim to govern, in the name of ''the people''. Both the [[Roman Republic]] and the [[Roman Empire]] used the [[Latin]] term ''[[SPQR|Senatus Populusque Romanus]]'', (the Senate and People of Rome). This term was fixed to Roman legionary standards, and even after the [[Roman Emperor]]s achieved a state of total personal [[autarchy]], they continued to wield their power in the name of the Senate and People of Rome.

A [[People's Republic]] is typically a [[Marxism|Marxist]] or [[Socialism|socialist]] [[one-party state]] that claims to govern on behalf of the people even if it in practice often turns out to be a [[dictatorship]]. [[Populism]] is another umbrella term for various political tendencies that claim to represent the people, usually with an implication that they serve the ''common people'' instead of the [[Elitism|elite]].

Chapter One, Article One of the [[Charter of the United Nations]] states that peoples have the right to [[self-determination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter1.shtml |title=Charter of the United Nations: Chapter I: Purposes and Principles |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=22 April 2013 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6YNQicd2P?url=http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter1.shtml |archive-date=8 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In law ==
{{further information|Popular sovereignty}}
In [[criminal law]], in certain jurisdictions, criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of ''the People''. Several U.S. states, including [[California]], [[Illinois]], and [[New York (state)|New York]], use this style.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''[[People v. Anderson|California v. Anderson]]'' 6 Cal. 3d 628; 493 P.2d 880; 100 Cal. Rptr. 152; 1972 Cal.

'''Qutalmish''' ({{lang-1ca|قُتَلمِش}}, {{lang-fa|قتلمش}}) (alternative spellings: '''Qutulmush''', '''Kutalmish''', {{lang|tr|'''Kutalmış'''}}) was a Turkic prince who was a member of Seljukid house in the 11th century. His son [[Suleiman ibn Qutulmish|Kutalmışoglu Suleiman]], founded the [[Sultanate of Rum]] in what is now Turkey.

==Sultanate of Rûm==
Kutalmish was the son of [[Arslan Yabgu]] and a cousin of [[Tughril]] and played a vital role in the conquests of the [[Seljuq Turks]]. In 1046, he was sent with an army by Tughril to force back the Byzantine army at Ganja and was victorious.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Sicker, ''The Islamic World in Ascendancy: From the Arab Conquests to the Siege of Vienna'', (Greenwood Publishing, 2000), 53.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He supported a rebellion against Tughril and contested the succession to the throne with [[Alp Arslan]]. (''see'' [[Battle of Damghan (1063)]]) According to the historian [[Ali ibn al-Athir]], Kutalmish knew the sciences of the stars.&lt;ref&gt;''Institutionalisation of Science in the Medreses of pre-Ottoman and Ottoman Turkey'', Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, '''Turkish Studies in the History and Philosophy of Science''', Ed.

A '''regnal name''', or '''reign name''', is the name used by [[monarch]]s and [[pope]]s during their [[reign]]s and, subsequently, historically. Since ancient times, some monarchs have chosen to use a different name from their original name when they accede to the monarchy. 
 
The regnal name is usually followed by a [[regnal number]], written as a [[Roman numeral]], to differentiate that monarch from others who have used the same name while ruling the same realm. In some cases, the monarch has more than one regnal name, but the regnal number is based on only one of those names, for example [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden]], [[George Tupou V]] of [[Tonga]]. If a monarch reigns in more than one realm, he or she may carry different ordinals in each one, as some realms may have had different numbers of rulers of the same regnal name. For example, the same person was both [[James VI and I|King James I of England and King James VI of Scotland]].

The ordinal is not normally used for the first ruler of the name, but is used in historical references once the name is used again. Thus, [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] of England was called simply "Elizabeth of England" until the accession of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] almost four centuries later in 1952; subsequent historical references to the earlier queen retroactively refer to her as Elizabeth I. However, [[Paul I of Russia|Tsar Paul I of Russia]], [[Umberto I of Italy|King Umberto I of Italy]], [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|King Juan Carlos I of Spain]], and [[Pope John Paul I]] all used the ordinal I (first) during their reigns, while [[Pope Francis]] does not. In spoken English, such names are pronounced as "Elizabeth the First", "George the Sixth" etc.

In some countries in Asia, monarchs took or take [[Chinese era name|era names]]. While era names as such are not used in many monarchies, sometimes eras are named after a monarch (usually long-lived), or a succession of monarchs of the same name. This is customary; there is no formal or general rule. The whole period during which a succession of four Georges ([[George I of Great Britain|George I]], [[George II of Great Britain|II]], [[George III of Great Britain|III]], and [[George IV of Great Britain|IV]]) of the Hanoverian dynasty reigned in Great Britain became known as the [[Georgian era]]; although there were many Edwards, the [[Edwardian era]] always refers to the reign of [[Edward VII]] at the beginning of the 20th century.

==Monarchies==

===Ancient rulers===
{{Further|Throne name (Ancient Egypt)}}
Ancient rulers in many parts of the world took regnal names or throne names which were different from their personal name.  This is known to be true, for instance, of several kings of [[Assyria]], and appears to be the case for several Kings of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]].  In [[Ancient Egypt]], Pharaohs took a number of names - the ''[[Ancient Egyptian royal titulary#(Throne name (praenomen)|praenomen]]'' being the most commonly used, on occasion in conjunction with their personal name.

=== Africa ===
==== Ethiopia ====
In the [[Ethiopian Empire]], especially during the [[Solomonic dynasty]], many [[List of Emperors of Ethiopia|Emperors]] would take a throne name, though this was not a general practice; a great number of rulers would remain known during their reign by their birth names. [[Yekuno Amlak of Ethiopia|Yekuno Amlak]], the founder of the Solomonic dynasty, took his father's name, Tasfa Iyasus, as his throne name. [[Yagbe'u Seyon of Ethiopia|Yagbe'u Seyon]], his son and heir, took the throne name [[Solomon|Salomon]] after the biblical figure. [[Amda Seyon I of Ethiopia|Amda Seyon]] took the throne name Gebre Mesqel, "slave of the [[Christian cross|cross]]"; [[Tewodros I of Ethiopia|Tewodros I]] was Walda Ambasa, "son of the lion"; [[Sarwe Iyasus]] was Mehreka Nañ "distributor of your [the [[Names of God|Lord]]'s] mercy"; etc. Tafari Makonnen, the last sovereign Emperor of Ethiopia, took as his throne name [[Haile Selassie I|Haile Selassie]], meaning "Power of the [[Trinity]]".

==== Nigeria ====
In the various extant [[List of Nigerian traditional states|traditional states]] of [[Nigeria]], the regnal names of the titled monarchs, who are known locally as the [[Nigerian traditional rulers|traditional rulers]], serve two very important functions within the monarchical system. Firstly, seeing as how most states are organised in such a way as to mean that ''all'' of the legitimate descendants of the first man or woman to arrive at the site of any given community are considered its dynastic [[heir]]s, their thrones are usually rotated amongst almost endless pools of contending cousins who all share the names of the founders of their houses as primary surnames. In order to tell them all apart from one another, secondary surnames are also used for the [[sept]]s of each of the royal families that are eligible for the aforementioned rotations, names that often come from the names of state of the first members of their immediate lineages to rule in their lands. Whenever any of their direct heirs ascend the thrones, they often use their septs' names as reign names as well, using the appropriate ordinals to differentiate themselves from  the founders of the said septs. An example of this is found in the kingdom of [[Lagos]], where the Adeniji-Adele family is distinguished from their numerous Adele cousins by the word ''Adeniji'', which was actually the first name of the reigning founder of their branch of the dynasty, the [[Oba (ruler)|Oba]] [[Adeniji Adele|Adeniji Adele II]]. This distinction notwithstanding, both groups of [[dynast]]s (as well as a number of other ones that don't have the name Adele as an official surname, such as that of the Oloye Adekunle Ojora, a prominent nobleman of royal descent) are part of what is known as the Adele Ajosun Ruling House of Lagos.

Beyond that which is described above, regnal names also serve in Nigeria and indeed in much of Africa as chronological markers in much the same way that those of Europe do (e.g. the ''Victorian'' era). Whenever one hears of a person describing what happened at the time when so and so ruled over any particular place or people, what he or she is actually saying is that an event happened within a finite period of time, one that is equal to the duration of the reign of the monarch in question. Now seeing as how it is possible (and in fact common, particularly among the southern tribes) for one individual to have several different names and aliases in a single life, a certain degree of uniformity in usage is required if the history of an entire state is to be tied to his or her name. It is for this reason that when new monarchs are enthroned, the uniqueness of their names is usually considered to be a matter of considerable importance (even when it is caused by nothing more than the adding of ordinals to them or the allowing of more than a generation to pass before their  subsequent usage). An example of this can be found in the [[kingdom of Benin]], where the throne name of [[Erediauwa I]] became the surname of all of his immediate family in the Eweka royal house of the state, thus nominally tying them and their descendants to the era of his reign. This is especially obvious when their branch's name is compared to the last names of the said king's brothers and their heirs, named the Akenzuas after his father [[Akenzua II]], and his uncles and their heirs, named the Ewekas after his grandfather [[Eweka II]].

In the case of the comparatively small number of Nigerian monarchs, such as Obi [[Nnaemeka Alfred Ugochukwu Achebe|Nnaemeka Achebe]] of [[Onitsha]], who do not make use of regnal names as a result of a variety of reasons, pre-coronation names are maintained during their reigns.

===Asia===
In parts of east Asia, it is more a rule than an exception that monarchs take additional names when ascending, and quite often discard the name they were known by as princes. Often the assumed name is different from the childhood name, and a new [[temple name]] could be assumed. A [[posthumous name]] is sometimes accorded to a deceased monarch. Rebel leaders may also take regnal names. The regnal names of some monarchs were long, for example [[Lý Thái Tổ]], [[Jiajing Emperor|Emperor Shizong of Ming]] and [[Emperor Gojong of the Korean Empire]]. While many rulers in east Asia (including in China, Vietnam, Korea and Japan) took regnal names based on [[Chinese characters]], some monarchs of [[Xu (state)|Xu]], [[Xiongnu]], [[Tuyuhun Kingdom]], [[Rouran Khaganate]], [[Göktürks]], [[Uyghur Khaganate]] and [[List of Mongol Khans|Mongol]] took Chinese transliterated non-Chinese regnal names. For details on the multiple names assumed by individual East Asian monarchs, see:
* [[Chinese era name]]
* [[Japanese era name]]

* [[List of Monarchs of Korea]]
* [[List of Mongolian monarchs]]
* [[List of Vietnamese monarchs]]
* [[Rama (Kings of Thailand)]]
* [[List of sovereign state leaders in the Philippines|List of Rulers in the Philippines]]
Some [[royal family]] members may receive honorary names such as [[:zh:徽号|Huihao]] and [[:ja:宮号|Miyagō]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cc.matsuyama-u.ac.jp/~tamura/itijikinn.pdf 紀宮は、宮号（みやごう＝皇族に天皇がおくる称号）]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===

====Hungary====
During the Medieval Age, when the [[House of Árpád]] disappeared in 1301, two of the monarchs that claimed the throne and were crowned chose a different name. [[Otto III, Duke of Bavaria]] became Bela V of Hungary, taking the name of his maternal grandfather, [[Béla IV of Hungary]]. In the other hand, [[Wenceslaus III of Bohemia]] signed his royal documents in Hungary as Ladislas, this being a very traditional name in the Kingdom.

Later during the first half of the 14th century, [[Charles I of Hungary]] signed as "''Carolus rex''", but in fact his birth name was the Italian ''Caroberto''. This is why he is often referred to by the Hungarian historians as "Charles Robert of Hungary".

====Netherlands====
All ruling male members of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]] bore the name [[Willem]] (William). The current king of the Netherlands was christened [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|Willem-Alexander]]. During an interview in 1997 he said he intended to rule under the name of Willem IV, but he had a change of mind. In a televised interview just before his inauguration, he announced he would continue to use the name Willem-Alexander, saying "I spent 46 years of my life under the name Willem-Alexander, and specifically under the nickname of Alexander. I think it would be weird to discard that because I become king of the country." Furthermore, he said he did not consider himself "a mere number", adding that regnal numbers reminded him of Dutch cattle naming conventions.&lt;ref&gt;http://nos.nl/koningshuis/video/496848-willem-4-staat-bij-bertha-38-in-de-wei.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poland====
When the [[House of Piast]] disappeared and the [[Lithuania]]n [[House of Jagiellon]] was elected in the figure of the High Duke [[Jogaila]], this monarch took the name of Władysław II, in honour of the previous Polish king ([[Władysław I the Elbow-high]]) with this traditional name. Similarly, when the Elector of Saxony, Frederick Augustus I, was elected king in 1697, he took the name of Augustus II. His son Frederick Augustus II crowned in 1734, also took the name of Augustus, becoming Augustus III.

====Portugal====
The [[List of Portuguese monarchs|monarchs of Portugal]] have traditionally used their first baptismal name as their regnal name upon their accession. The only notable exception was [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho I]], who was born Martin of Burgundy (''Martinho de Borgonha'', in Portuguese). As he was not the heir to the throne, Martin was expected to join the clergy, and was named after [[Martin of Tours|Saint Martin of Tours]], on whose feast day he had been born. When the [[heir apparent]], Henry, died, the prince's name was changed to Sancho, one with a more established royal tradition in the other Iberian monarchies (Navarre, Castile and Aragon).

====United Kingdom====
Though most [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarchs of the United Kingdom]] have used their first baptismal name as their regnal name, on three occasions monarchs have chosen a different name.

First, [[Queen Victoria]] had been christened Alexandrina Victoria, but took the throne under the name Victoria.

When Victoria's son, Prince Albert Edward, became king in 1901, he took the regnal name [[Edward VII]], against the wish of his late mother.&lt;ref name="Regnal Names"&gt;{{cite book |last=Panton |first=Kenneth |date= |title=Historical Dictionary of the British Monarchy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BiyyueBTpaMC&amp;pg=PA392&amp;lpg=PA392&amp;dq=Prince+Albert+Edward,+became+king+in+1901,+he+took+the+regnal+name+%5B%5BEdward+VII%5D%5D,+against+the+wish+of+his+late+mother&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bjK3UziERz&amp;sig=q8hJv92WqVVppR4SZvLTfleoHQY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjUwdPAoe_OAhXEoJQKHb9RA1wQ6AEIJTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Prince%20Albert%20Edward%2C%20became%20king%20in%201901%2C%20he%20took%20the%20regnal%20name%20%5B%5BEdward%20VII%5D%5D%2C%20against%20the%20wish%20of%20his%20late%20mother&amp;f=false |location=US |publisher=Scarecrow Press |page=392 |isbn=978-0810857797}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new king declared that he chose the name Edward alone as an honoured name borne by six of his predecessors, and that he did not wish to diminish the status of [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|his father]], with whom alone among royalty the name Albert should be associated.

In 1936, after the [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdication crisis]], Prince Albert, Duke of York, assumed the throne as [[George VI|King George VI]] rather than "King Albert". His full name was Albert Frederick Arthur George; like Edward VII and Victoria he used another of his names.

There has been speculation that the current [[heir apparent]] to the British throne, [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], may elect not to be known as "Charles III" out of concern about comparisons with [[Charles II of England]] (who was known for his Catholic sympathies), [[Charles I of England]] (who was executed after the [[English Civil War]]) and the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] memory of the "Young Pretender" [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (who claimed the title "Charles III").&lt;ref name="CallMeGeorge"&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article782407.ece|work=The Times |location=UK | title=Call me George, suggests Charles | date=24 December 2005| accessdate=13 July 2009 | first=Andrew | last=Pierce}} {{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; He may instead choose to be known as George VII in honour of his grandfather.&lt;ref name="CallMeGeorge" /&gt; However, the Prince has not as yet announced any decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/dec/27/monarchy.michaelwhite|work=The Guardian |location=UK | title=Charles denies planning to reign as King George | date=27 December 2005| accessdate=2 October 2012 | first=Michael | last=White}}&lt;/ref&gt; His full name is Charles Philip Arthur George.

====Scotland====
When [[Robert III of Scotland|John, Earl of Carrick]] ascended the Scottish throne in 1390, it was deemed imprudent for him to take the regnal name of "John II", as recent kings named John had turned out badly: [[John of England|in England]] as well as [[John Balliol|in Scotland]]. Furthermore, royal propaganda of the time held that John Balliol had not been a legitimate king of Scotland, making the new king's [[regnal number]] also a tricky issue. To avoid these problems, John took the regnal name of ''Robert III'', honouring [[Robert II of Scotland|his father]] and [[Robert I of Scotland|great-grandfather]].&lt;ref&gt;Magnusson, Magnus, ''Scotland: The Story of a Nation'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the accession, in 1952, of [[Elizabeth II]] the title ''Elizabeth II'' caused controversy in Scotland as there had never been a Scottish ''Elizabeth I''. The Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] informed the [[British House of Commons]] that the practice since the Union was to use the higher numeral. New [[Royal Mail]] post boxes in Scotland, bearing the [[Royal Cypher|cypher]] ''E&lt;small&gt;II&lt;/small&gt;R'', were vandalised, after which, to avoid further problems, post boxes and Royal Mail vehicles in Scotland bore only the [[Crown of Scotland]]. A legal case, ''[[MacCormick v. Lord Advocate]]'' (1953 SC 396), contested the right of the Queen to title herself ''Elizabeth II'' in Scotland, arguing that to do so would be a breach of the [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union]]. The case, however, was lost on the grounds that the pursuers had no title to sue the Crown, and also that the numbering of monarchs was part of the [[royal prerogative]], and thus not governed by the Act of Union.

====The Roman Empire====
The Roman Emperors usually had the titles of Imperator Caesar Augustus in their names. (which made their regnal names) Caesar came from the cognomen of Gaius Julius Caesar, Imperator meant Commander and Augustus meant venerable or majestic. The name usually went in two ways, Imperator (Praenomen, Nomen and Cognomen) Caesar Augustus or Imperator Caesar (Praenomen, Nomen and Cognomen) Augustus. Also Imperator became a Praenomen of Roman Emperors, Augustus and Caesar became a cognomen of theirs.

==Religious offices==

===Catholic Church===
{{Main|Papal name}}
Immediately after a new pope is elected, and accepts the election, he is asked by the [[Dean of the College of Cardinals]], "By what name shall you be called?" The new pope chooses the name by which he will be known. The senior Cardinal Deacon, or [[Cardinal Protodeacon]], then appears on the balcony of [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] to proclaim the new Pope, informing the world of the man elected Pope, and under which name he would be known during his reign.

&lt;blockquote lang="la" style="font-style:italic; width:42%; margin:1em 4%; float:left;"&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum:
[[Habemus Papam]],
Eminentissimum ac Reverendissimum Dominum,
Dominum [forename],
Sanctæ Romanæ Ecclesiæ Cardinalem [surname],
qui sibi nomen imposuit [papal name].
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="width:42%; margin:1em 4%; float:left;"&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
I announce to you a great joy:
We have a Pope,
The Most Eminent and Most Reverend Lord,
Lord [forename],
Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church [surname],
who conferred upon himself the name [papal name].
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the first centuries of the church, priests elected [[bishop of Rome]] continued to use their baptismal names after their elections. The custom of choosing a new name began in AD 533 with the election of [[Pope John II|Mercurius]]. Mercurius had been named after the Roman god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], and decided that it would not be appropriate for a pope to be named after a Roman god. Mercurius subsequently decreed that he would be known as John II. Since the end of the tenth century the pope has customarily chosen a new name for himself during his Pontificate; however, until the 16th century some pontiffs used their [[Given name|baptismal names]].

The last pope to use his baptismal name was [[Pope Marcellus II]] in 1555, a choice that was even then quite exceptional. The names chosen by popes are not based on any system other than general honorifics. They have been based on immediate predecessors, mentors, political similarity, or even after family members—as was the case with [[Pope John XXIII]]. The practice of using the baptismal name as papal name has not been ruled out and future popes could elect to continue using their original names after being elected pope.

Often the new pontiff's choice of name upon being elected to the papacy is seen as a signal to the world of whom the new pope will emulate or what policies he will seek to enact. Such is the case with [[Benedict XVI]] who, in fact, explained the [[Pope Benedict XVI#Choice of name|reasons for his choice of name]] during his first General Audience in St. Peter's Square, on 27 April 2005. On that occasion, he said that he wanted to remember "[[Pope Benedict XV]], that courageous prophet of peace, who guided the Church through turbulent times of war," and also "[[Saint Benedict of Nursia]], co-patron of Europe, whose life evokes the Christian roots of Europe."

There has never been a [[Pope Peter II]]. Even though there is no specific prohibition against choosing the name Peter, bishops elected to the Papacy have refrained from doing so even if their own given name was Peter. This is because of a tradition that only [[Saint Peter]] should have that honor. In the 10th century [[Pope John XIV|John XIV]] used the regnal name ''John'' because his given name was Peter. While some [[antipope]]s did take the name Peter II, their claims are not recognized by the mainstream Roman Catholic Church, and each of these men only either has or had a minuscule following that recognized their claims.

Probably because of the controversial [[Antipope John XXIII]], new popes avoided taking the regnal name John for over 600 years until the election of [[Pope John XXIII|Angelo Cardinal Roncalli]] in 1958. Immediately after his election, there was some confusion as to whether he would be known as John XXIII or John XXIV. Cardinal Roncalli thus moved to immediately resolve by declaring that he would be known as John XXIII.

In 1978, [[Albino Luciani]] became the first pope to use two names for his regnal name when he took the name [[Pope John Paul I|John Paul I]], including the "I". He took the "John Paul" name to honor both John XXIII and [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]]. With the unexpected death of John Paul I a little over a month later, [[Pope John Paul II|Karol Wojtyła]] took the name John Paul II to honor his immediate predecessor.

[[Antipope]]s also have regnal names, and also use the ordinal to show their position in the line of previous pontiffs with their names. For example, [[David Bawden]] took the name Michael I when declared pope in 1990.

===Coptic Church===
[[Coptic Pope]]s also choose regnal names distinct from their given names.

=== Islamic caliphates ===

{{see also|List of caliphs}}

A '''religious name''' is a type of [[given name]] bestowed for a religious purpose, and which is generally used in religious contexts.  Different types of religious names may be in use among  [[clergy]] of a religion, as well in some cases among the [[laity]].

==Christianity==

===Catholic Church===

====Baptism name====
In [[baptism]], [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] are given a [[Christian name]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Thurston |first=Herbert |title=Christian Names |year=1911 |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |publication-place=[[New York City|New York]] |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10673c.htm |accessdate=May 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which should not be "foreign to Christian sentiment"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P7K.HTM#$295 Code of Canon Law, canon 2156]&lt;/ref&gt; and is often the name of a [[saint]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/liturgicalyear/activities/view.cfm?id=207 Catholic Activity: Baptismal Names]&lt;/ref&gt; In East Asia, in Africa and elsewhere, the baptismal name is distinct from the traditional-style given name.

====Confirmation name====
In some countries, it is common to adopt a [[Confirmation#Confirmation name|confirmation name]], in addition to the baptismal name.

====Monastic and papal name====
In some [[religious institute]]s, a new member takes a [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]] name. In Italian, a religious figure is often referred to by their religious name and by their secular name or their ''[[:it:al secolo]]'' name. A [[Papal election|newly elected]] [[Pope]] also takes on a new name, called his [[regnal name]] or [[papal name]].

===Eastern Orthodox Church===
====Baptism name====
In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] converts often take a new name at the time of their reception into the church, either by [[baptism]] or [[chrismation]]. A person's religious name is always the name of a [[saint]], who then becomes that person's [[patron saint]]. When deciding on a name for their child, Orthodox parents will often name the child after a [[saint]] whose [[feast day]] falls on either the day of the child's birth or the day of its baptism. Traditionally, Orthodox Christians celebrate their "[[name day]]" (i.e., the feast day of their patron saint), rather than their birthday.

====Monastic name====
Orthodox [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s are often given a new monastic name at the time of their [[tonsure]] (i.e., when they take their [[monastic vows]]). A monastic name is usually the name of a [[prophet]] or a [[monastic]] saint. Sometimes, the monastic name will begin with the same initial as the individual's baptismal name.

==Judaism==
[[Conversion to Judaism|Converts to Judaism]] take a [[Hebrew name]] upon conversion.  Born Jews generally have a [[patronymic]] Hebrew name which is used for religious purposes; this is frequently different from their [[legal name]], especially when the latter is of [[gentile]] or non-Hebrew origin.

==Buddhism==
Many [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] sects also practice this, with newly ordained [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] often given new names by their master. Lay Buddhists are also given [[Dharma name]]s during their [[Refuge (Buddhism)|refuge ceremony]].

==Others==

===Gaudiya Vaishnavism===
Members of [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|ISKCON]] and some other [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya Vaishnava]] organisations are given a "spiritual name" by their [[guru]] upon initiation. This name ends in "Das" or "Dasa" for men and "Dasi" for women (meaning "servant"), and generally begins with the same letter as the devotee's given name.

===Wicca===
In [[Wicca]], a [[craft name]] is often used.

===Parody religions===
It is usual for a [[Discordianism#Episkopos|Discordian Episkopos]] to adopt a faux-mystical and bizarre name for the duration of the Episkoposity; such names are not immutable and are frequently adapted over time. The same is true for the clergy of the related [[Church of the SubGenius]].

'''Share a Coke''' is a multi-national [[marketing campaign]] in for [[Coca-Cola]].

The campaign received multiple awards at the Creative Effectiveness Lion Awards at Cannes.&lt;ref&gt;''B &amp; T Weekly,'' "Cannes: Share a Coke 'most successful in decades'", ''B &amp; T Weekly'' [Australia], 18 June, 2014, http://www.bandt.com.au/advertising/Cannes-Share-a-Coke-most-successful-in-decades&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spary, S., "From Share a Coke to Mad Men: the campaigns that defined Coke under Wendy Clark," ''Campaign Live,'' 17 November, 2015, http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/1372962/share-coke-mad-men-campaigns-defined-coke-wendy-clark&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the company extended the campaign by increasing the number of names to 1,000.

A '''shield-maiden''' ({{lang-non|skjaldmær}}), in [[Scandinavian folklore]] and [[Norse mythology|mythology]] was a female warrior. They are often mentioned in [[saga]]s such as ''[[Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks]]'' and in ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''. Shield-maidens also appear in stories of other [[Germanic peoples]]: [[Goths]], [[Cimbri]], and [[Marcomanni]].&lt;ref name="nordisk"&gt;[http://runeberg.org/nfce/0728.html The article ''Sköldmö''] in ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'' (1917).&lt;/ref&gt; The mythical [[valkyrie]]s may have been based on the shield-maidens.&lt;ref name="nordisk"/&gt;

==Historical existence==
The historical existence of shield-maidens is heavily debated, but scholars including [[Neil Price (archaeologist)|Neil Price]],&lt;ref name="history.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/shows/vikings/videos/secrets-of-the-vikings-shield-maidens|title=Secrets of the Vikings: Shield Maidens|website=www.history.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125132543/http://www.history.com/shows/vikings/videos/secrets-of-the-vikings-shield-maidens|archivedate=25 January 2016|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that they existed while others, like scholar Judith Jesch disagree, citing a lack of hard evidence for trained or regular women warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/04/19/viking-women-warriors-and-valkyries/|title=Viking women, warriors, and valkyries|website=blog.britishmuseum.org|date=19 April 2014|first=Judith|last=Jesch|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194313/http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/04/19/viking-women-warriors-and-valkyries/|archivedate=3 March 2016|deadurl=yes|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/world/europe/sweden-viking-women-warriors-dna.html|title=A Female Viking Warrior? Tomb Study Yields Clues|date=14 September 2017|first=Christina|last=Anderson|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical accounts==
There are few historic attestations that [[Viking Age]] women took part in warfare, but the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] historian [[John Skylitzes]] records that women fought in battle when [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev]] attacked the Byzantines in [[Bulgaria]] in 971.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; When the [[Varangians]] (not to be confused with the Byzantine [[Varangian Guard]]) had suffered a devastating defeat in the [[Siege of Dorostolon]], the victors were stunned at discovering armed women among the fallen warriors.&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;Harrison, D. &amp; Svensson, K. (2007). ''Vikingaliv''. Fälth &amp; Hässler, Värnamo. {{ISBN|978-91-27-35725-9}}. p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Leif Erikson]]'s pregnant half-sister [[Freydís Eiríksdóttir]] was in [[Vinland]], she is reported to have taken up a sword, and, bare-breasted, scared away the attacking [[Skræling]]s.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; The fight is recounted in the ''[[Greenland saga]]'', though Freydís is not explicitly referred to as a shield-maiden in the text.&lt;ref name=Thorsson&gt;Thorsson, Ö. (Ed.) ''The Sagas of the Icelanders.'' Penguin Books, 1997. Anyway a mention of a single woman picking up a sword once can not be considered evidence of actual trained  female warriors.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saxo Grammaticus reported that shield-maidens fought on the side of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] at the [[Battle of Brávellir]] in the year 750:
{{quote|Now out of the town of Sle, under the captains [[Heiðr|Hetha]] (Heid) and Wisna, with Hakon Cut-cheek came Tummi the Sailmaker. On these captains, who had the bodies of women, nature bestowed the souls of men. [[Webiorg]] was also inspired with the same spirit, and was attended by Bo (Bui) Bramason and Brat the Jute, thirsting for war.|[[Saxo Grammaticus]]&lt;ref name=Saxo&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elton|first1=Oliver|title=THE DANISH HISTORY,  BOOKS I-IX by  Saxo Grammaticus|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1150|website=Project Gutenberg|publisher=Project Gutenberg|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Legendary accounts==
Examples of shield-maidens mentioned by name in the Norse sagas include [[Brynhildr]] in the ''[[Vǫlsunga saga]]'', [[Hervor]] in ''[[Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks]]'', the Brynhildr of the ''[[Bósa saga ok Herrauðs]]'', the Swedish princess Thornbjǫrg in ''[[Hrólfs saga Gautrekssonar]]'' and Princess Hed, Visna and [[Veborg]] in ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''.

Two shield-maidens appear in certain translations of the ''Hervarar saga''. The first of these Hervors was known to have taken up typically masculine roles early in her childhood and often raided travelers in the woods dressed as a man. Later in her life, she claimed the cursed sword [[Tyrfing]] from her father's burial site and became a seafaring raider.  She eventually settled and married. Her granddaughter was also named Hervor and commanded forces against attacking [[Huns]]. Although the saga remarks on her bravery she is mortally wounded by enemy forces and dies on the battlefield.&lt;ref name=Tolkien&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars Judith Jesch and Jenny Jochens theorize that shield-maidens' often grim fates or their sudden return to typically female roles is a testament to their role as figures of both male and female fantasy as well as emblematic of the danger of abandoning gender roles.&lt;ref name=Tolkien&gt;{{cite web|last=Tolkien|first=Christopher|title=The Saga of King Heidrik the Wise|url=http://vsnrweb-publications.org.uk/The%20Saga%20Of%20King%20Heidrek%20The%20Wise.pdf|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons Ltd.|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brynhildr Buðladóttir and Guðrún Gjúkadóttir===
{{Main|Brynhildr}}
Brynhildr of the ''Vǫlsunga saga'', along with her rival in love, [[Gudrun|Guðrún Gjúkadóttir]], provides an example of how a shield-maiden compares to more conventional aristocratic womanhood in the sagas.  Brynhildr is chiefly concerned with honor, much like a male warrior.  When she ends up married to Gudrun's brother [[Gunther|Gunnarr]] instead of [[Sigurd|Sigurðr]], the man she intended to marry, Brynhildr speaks a verse comparing the courage of the two men:
{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;Sigurd fought the dragon
And that afterward will be
Forgotten by no one
While men still live.
Yet your brother
Neither dared
To ride into the fire
Nor to leap across it.&lt;ref name=Byock&gt;Byock, Jesse L. (Trans.) ''Saga of the Volsungs.''University of California Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Brynhildr is married to Gunnarr and not Sigurðr because of deceit and trickery, including a potion of forgetfulness given to Sigurðr so he forgets his previous relationship with her.&lt;ref name=Byock/&gt; Brynhildr is upset not only for the loss of Sigurðr but also for the dishonesty involved. Similar to her male counterparts, the shield-maiden prefers to do things straightforwardly, without the deception considered stereotypically feminine in much of medieval literature. She enacts her vengeance directly, resulting in the deaths of herself, Sigurðr, and Sigurð's son by Guðrún. By killing the child, she demonstrates an understanding of feud and filial responsibility; if he lived, the boy would grow up to take vengeance on Brynhildr's family.

Guðrún has a similar concern with family ties, but at first does not usually act directly. She is more inclined to incite her male relatives to action than take up arms herself. Guðrún is no shield-maiden, and Brynhildr mocks her for this, saying, "Only ask what is best for you to know. That is suitable for noble women. And it is easy to be satisfied while everything happens according to your desires."&lt;ref name=Byock/&gt; In her later marriages, however, she is willing to kill her children, burn down a hall, and send her other sons to avenge the murder of her daughter, Svanhildr. In the world of the sagas, women can be both honorable and remorseless, much like the male heroes. While a shield-maiden does not fill a woman's typical role, her strength of character is found in even the more domestic women in these stories.

==In popular culture==
While women warriors are a staple of [[fantasy]], they are not often referred to as shield-maidens. Some who are include [[Éowyn]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and Thorgil in [[Nancy Farmer]]'s ''[[The Sea of Trolls]]'' trilogy.

In the 2013 TV series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'', the legendary Viking shield-maiden [[Lagertha]], played by [[Katheryn Winnick]], is a principal character.

[[File:Soslan.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Dancing Soslan, [[Vladikavkaz]]]]
[[File:Sosruko DSC06305.JPG|thumb|Sosruko tower in [[Nalchik]]]]
'''Sosruko''' or '''Sosriqwa''' ({{lang-os|Сослан}}, ''Soslan''; {{lang-kbd|Сосрыкъуэ}}, ''Sosryqwa''; {{lang-krc|Сосурукъ/Сосуркъа}}, ''Sosuruq/Sosurqa'') is a central character in many cycles of the [[Nart sagas]] of the [[Caucasus]].

Sosruko is a powerful but devious man who is the smallest of the Narts; as a character, he is sometimes cast in the light of the [[trickster]] god, comparable to the [[Scandinavia]]n [[Loki]] (who finds a closer parallel in the Nart [[Syrdon]] however), [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] [[Amirani]], or the [[Ancient Greek]] [[Prometheus]]. It is possible that at least in the latter case, Sosruku served as a direct inspiration.

In Circassian mythology, it was Nart Sosriqwe, minion of the gods and his doting mother, Lady [[Satanaya]], who stole fire from the giant.

== Etymology ==
The name etymologically came from Turkic languages: [[Nogai language|Nogai]] ''suslan-'' "to look menacing", ''suslä'' "menacing, gloomy" (hence {{lang-os|Soslan}}). The variants {{lang-ab|Sasərqwa}}, {{lang-ady|Саусырыкъо}} [{{ipa|saːwsərəqʷa}}], {{lang-kbd|Сосрыкъуэ}} [{{ipa|sawsərəqʷa}}], [[Ubykh language|Ubykh]]: [{{ipa|sawsərəqʷa}}], [[Digor dialect|Digor]] {{lang-os|Sosruqo, Sozyryqo, Sozuruqo}}.
The name Sosruko [{{ipa|saːwsərəqʷa}}] is from [[Circassian language|Circassian]] {{ipa|sa}} "sword" + {{ipa|wa}} "hit" + {{ipa|sər}} "heat" + {{ipa|qʷa}} "son"; hence literally “The son of the fiery sword hit”.

[[File:Women are Persons-two.jpg|thumb|right|[[Louise McKinney]] and [[Henrietta Muir Edwards]], Famous Five statue, [[Parliament Hill]], [[Ottawa]]]]
'''The Famous Five''', or '''The Valiant Five''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kome|first=Penney|title=Women of Influence: Canadian Women and Politics|year=1985|publisher=Doubleday Canada|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-385-23140-4|pages=31–32|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=CBF8UvjlN8KiyAGu3IHwDg&amp;id=hBQqAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22valiant+five%22+emily+murphy&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22valiant+five%22|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{Lang-fr|Célèbres cinq}}) were five Alberta women who asked the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] to answer the question, "Does the word 'Persons' in Section 24 of the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act, 1867]], include female persons?" in the case ''[[Edwards v Canada (AG)|Edwards v Canada]].''&lt;ref name=Brennan&gt;{{cite book | first=Brian| last=Brennan| title=Alberta Originals: Stories of Albertans Who Made a Difference| year=2001| publisher= Fifth House| page= 14| isbn= 1-894004-76-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five women, [[Emily Murphy]], [[Irene Parlby|Irene Marryat Parlby]], [[Nellie McClung|Nellie Mooney McClung]], [[Louise McKinney|Louise Crummy McKinney]] and [[Henrietta Muir Edwards]], created a petition to ask this question. They fought to have women legally considered persons so that women could be appointed to the Senate. The petition was filed on August 27, 1927,&lt;ref name="Alberta1999"&gt;{{cite book| title=Alberta History| volume=47–49| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jL06AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=famous+five+persons+case+august+27&amp;dq=famous+five+persons+case+august+27| accessdate=May 10, 2013| year=1999| publisher=Historical Society of Alberta}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on April 24, 1928, Canada's Supreme Court summarized its unanimous decision that women are not such "persons".&lt;ref name = Brennan/&gt;

The last line of the judgement reads, "Understood to mean 'Are women eligible for appointment to the [[Senate of Canada]],' the question is answered in the negative." This judgement was overturned by the British [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] on October 18, 1929. This case came to be known as the "[[Persons Case]]". Although Canadian women (those who were British/Canadian citizens) had the vote in many provinces and in federal elections by 1929, the case was part of a continent-wide drive for political equality, coming seven years after discrimination against women's voting rights was prohibited in the United States through the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], and thus had important ramifications.

Some saw this as "radical change"; others saw it as a restoration of the original framing of the English constitutional documents, including the [[1689 Bill of Rights]], which uses only the term "person", not the term "man" (or "woman" for that matter).

Some others have interpreted the Privy Council rule as causing a change in the Canadian judicial approach to the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]], an approach that has come to be known as the "[[living tree doctrine]]".

==The Five==
The famous five women were:

* [[Emily Murphy]] (1868–1933), the [[British Empire]]'s first female judge;
* [[Irene Parlby|Irene Marryat Parlby]] (1868–1965), farm women's leader, political activist and first female [[Cabinet minister]] in Alberta, still serving in that capacity at the time of the court case;
* [[Nellie McClung|Nellie Mooney McClung]] (1873–1951), a [[suffragist]] and author, member of the Alberta Legislature 1921–1926;
* [[Louise McKinney|Louise Crummy McKinney]] (1868–1931), the first woman elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]], or any legislature in Canada or the rest of the British Empire, but no longer MLA at the time of the court case;
* [[Henrietta Muir Edwards]] (1849–1931), an advocate for working women, author and a founding member of the [[Victorian Order of Nurses]].

===Emily Murphy===
{{Main|Emily Murphy}}
Emily Murphy stood out in the famous five, bringing them to a victory in 1929. Emily was appointed to the office of Magistrate of the Edmonton Juvenile Court in 1916 and later became the magistrate of the newly created Women's Court. At the time, no woman had held such a position and many men objected.&lt;ref name=MacEwan&gt;{{cite book |first=Grant| last=MacEwan| title=...and Mighty Women too: Stories of Notable Western Canadian Women| year=1975| publisher= Western Producer Prairie Books| isbn=978-0919306653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her career as a writer, Murphy used the pen name "Janey Canuck". In 1922, she wrote ''The Black Candle'' which detailed her beliefs on race and drug use in Canada and strongly influenced the drug policy of the day. Murphy came from a privileged background in which white women were protected from many topics.&lt;ref name="Millar"&gt;{{cite book |first=Nancy |last=Millar |title=The Famous Five: Five Canadian Women and Their Fight to Become Persons |year=1999 |publisher=Western Heritage Centre| isbn=978-0920109168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irene Parlby===
{{Main|Irene Parlby}}
In 1916, Irene Parlby was elected as the first president of the United Farm Women of Alberta and in 1921, was elected to the Alberta legislature and received a cabinet post in the United Farmers of Alberta government, becoming the second woman in the British Empire to hold ministerial rank. She served as cabinet minister until the downfall of the government in 1935. Parlby worked with the Red Cross during [[World War I]] and later served on the Board of Governors of the [[University of Alberta]].&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

===Nellie McClung===
{{Main|Nellie McClung}}
Nellie McClung's jobs in her lifetime included teacher, author, public speaker, temperance activist, internationally known women's rights activist, and politician {Warne, Literature as Pulpit]. In 1918, she was a member of the Dominion War Council and the only woman representative at the League of Nations.  She represented Canada at the Ecumenical Council of the Methodist church in 1921 and was the first woman on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] Board of the Governors.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;  In 1921, McClung was elected to the Alberta legislature as an MLA in Edmonton for the Liberal Party.&lt;ref name=Millar/&gt; She served one term, not being re-elected in 1926. She was a member of the Political Equality League of Manitoba, and she played the leading role in the Mock Parliament held on January 29, 1914, at the Walker Theatre in Winnipeg, which humorously discussed Votes for Men.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

===Louise McKinney===
{{Main|Louise McKinney}}
Louise McKinney became one of the first two women elected to a legislature in the British Empire, and the first to take her seat. She was a founder of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] in Alberta and the West – she served as the organization's vice-president for more than 22 years beginning in 1906 – and regularly attended World Meetings of the WCTU. She signed the appeal to the Privy Council in 1929. In 1931, she became president of the Canadian Union, Woman's Christian Temperance Union. McKinney was also named to be Commissioner for the first General Council of the [[United Church of Canada]], and was the only woman to sign the Basis of Union.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

===Henrietta Muir Edwards===
{{Main|Henrietta Muir Edwards}}
Henrietta Muir Edwards, author and researcher on women's topics, held an influence within the National Council of Women&lt;ref name = Brennan/&gt; and held chairmanship of the Committee in Law in the National Council of Women for more than 35 years. She was also a Red Cross leader during the war years. Edwards was the secretary of the National Subcommittee which focused on thrift and economy in Canadian homes.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

==Legacy==

===Honorary senators===
None of the five became [[Senate of Canada#Senators|senators]]; the first female senator was Quebecer [[Cairine Reay Wilson]], appointed four months after the ruling. Nearly 80 years later, on October 8, 2009, the Senate voted to make the five the first "honorary senators".&lt;ref name=cbc&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/story/2009/10/10/calgary-famous-five-honourary-senators.html |title='Famous 5' named honorary senators |work=[[CBC News]] |publisher=CBC.ca |date=October 10, 2009 |accessdate=May 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hansard&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/common/..%5C40%5C2%5Cparlbus%5Cchambus%5Csenate/deb-E/059db_2009-10-08-e.htm?Language=E&amp;Parl=40&amp;Ses=2#53|title=Senate of Canada – Debates|first=Senate of|last=Canada|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The achievement of personhood for women had been a monumental change which gave more power to women.

Some might well question the overall significance of the decision, noting that by the 1920s the Senate of Canada was a largely powerless body. The more powerful [[House of Commons of Canada]] had elected its first female member ([[Agnes Macphail]]) in 1921, well before the Persons Case. However, the precedent did establish the principle that women could hold any political office in Canada. Moreover, the Five clearly did devote their energies to increasing women's participation on legislative bodies with greater power: three had been members of the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|Alberta legislature]]. The controversy surrounding the women has made commemoration difficult.{{Citation needed|date = August 2012}} The five women were activists in a variety of areas in their pursuit to better the conditions for women and children.

===Opinions on the Famous Five===
Opinions on the Famous Five vary considerably. Many laud them as trailblazers for women. Others are disturbed by the opinions of some of the women on other issues, such as opposition to non-white immigration and their successful campaigns to have [[eugenics]] legislation introduced in Canadian provinces, which resulted in the sterilization of thousands of those deemed "mentally deficient" or "insane" in Alberta and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/eugenics-keeping-canada-sane-feature/&lt;/ref&gt; Emily Murphy was not shy with her opinions and her outspoken nature had a tendency to give her a negative reputation. She wrote letters of her opinions to police chiefs, government officials, social service agencies and judicial officials about the extent of drug traffic and possible cures. Nellie McClung was known as the most memorable and popular of the famous five. Her causes included women's right to vote, prohibition, women in the church and women in public life.&lt;ref name=Millar/&gt;  Henrietta Muir Edwards was described as "tenacious" with her work with prohibition.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

The five women were activists in a variety of areas in their pursuit to better the conditions for women and children. Emily Murphy dealt with single mothers and issues of child support, child welfare, and adoption by lobbying for women's rights.&lt;ref name = Sharpe&gt;{{cite book| first=Robert J.| last=Sharpe| title=The Persons Case: The Origins and Legacy of the Fight for Legal Personhood| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HOwC1vcGgcEC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4| isbn=978-0802096289| year=2007| publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nellie McClung favoured free medical and dental treatment for school children as well as mothers' allowances and better property rights for women. She was open to divorce and birth control but opposed the sale and use of liquor. Louise McKinney believed strongly in the "evils of alcohol" and pushed to enact prohibition measures. She advocated excluding cigarettes from parcels sent to soldiers in World War&amp;nbsp;I in 1917. She supported reasonable measures for social welfare and health as well as introducing bills intended to make prohibition more effective, to improve the lot of immigrants and bring better security to widows. She was responsible for the introduction of a motion which led to the [[Dower Act]]. Irene Parlby in her position as cabinet minister in Alberta pursued these goals expressed by McKinney. Henrietta Edwards worked with property law and sought to protect women and children.&lt;ref name=Millar/&gt;

===Commemorations===
The Famous Five have been commemorated with individual and group plaques in the [[Centre Block#Senate foyer|foyer]] and antechamber of Canada's Senate, and two identical sculptures by Canadian artist [[Barbara Paterson]], one on [[Parliament Hill]] in [[Ottawa]], the other at the [[Olympic Plaza (Calgary)|Olympic Plaza]] in [[Calgary]]. The sculpture on Parliament Hill was unveiled on October 18, 2000, in a public ceremony that included [[French language in Canada|French]] and [[Canadian English|English]] singers, [[Inuit]] dancers, and speeches by [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Adrienne Clarkson]] and [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Jean Chrétien]]. A sculpture of the Famous Five by sculptor Helen Granger Young stands on the grounds of the Manitoba Legislature in Winnipeg. Commissioned by the Nellie McClung Foundation, it was unveiled at a ceremony on June 18, 2010.

The City of [[Edmonton]] has named one park in its River Valley Parks System after each of the "Famous Five".&lt;ref name="edmonton"&gt;{{cite web| title=Alphabetical Park Listing| url=http://www.edmonton.ca/attractions_recreation/parks_rivervalley/alphabetical-park-listing.aspx| publisher=City of Edmonton| date=May 14, 2012| accessdate=May 14, 2012| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127115516/http://edmonton.ca/attractions_recreation/parks_rivervalley/alphabetical-park-listing.aspx| archivedate=November 27, 2012| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murphy had many accomplishments, such as becoming the first president of the Federated Women's Institute of Canada, vice-president of [[National Council of Women]] of Canada, president of [[Canadian Women's Press Club]], director of the Canadian Council of Child Welfare, vice-president of the Canadian Association of Child Protection, first president of the Women's Canadian Club of Edmonton and vice-president of the Social Service Council of Canada. Emily Murphy also received many honours for her life's work including being decorated by King [[George V]] to be a Lady of Grace of the [[Order of Saint John (chartered 1888)|Order of St. John of Jerusalem]].

Irene Parlby was honoured in 1935 at spring convocation at the [[University of Alberta]] with an honorary LL.D. degree. Tributes in honour of Henrietta Edwards can be found on a plaque in the Senate Chamber in Ottawa and another in the post office in Fort Macleod. Nellie McClung spoke in Calgary after Edwards' passing and spoke of Edwards, "who for 40 years was convener of laws for the National Council of Women" should not be forgotten.&lt;ref name="MacEwan" /&gt;

Along with [[Thérèse Casgrain]], the Five were commemorated in the 2001 [[Journey Series (banknotes)|Journey Series]] of Canada's [[Canadian fifty-dollar bill|fifty-dollar bill]].&lt;ref name=Brennan/&gt;  In December 2011, the [[Bank of Canada]] announced that the Famous Five would not appear on the redesigned $50 [[Frontier Series]] banknote that it issued in 2012.&lt;ref name="50dollars"&gt;{{cite news| title=Should the new $50 bill show an Arctic research boat instead of the Famous Five?| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/yourcommunity/2011/12/should-the-new-50-bill-show-an-arctic-research-boat-instead-of-the-famous-five.html| work=CBC News| date=December 7, 2011| publisher=cbc.ca| accessdate=May 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The achievement of personhood for women had been a monumental change which gave more power to women. To honour the Five and continue to involve women in leadership roles in Canada, Frances Wright and others established the non-profit Famous Five Foundation on October 18, 1996, the 70th anniversary of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council's decision.&lt;ref name="5foundation"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.famous5.ca/index.php/about-us/about-us| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225022456/http://www.famous5.ca/index.php/about-us/about-us| dead-url=yes| archive-date=December 25, 2012| title=About Us| publisher=Famous 5 Foundation| date=| accessdate=May 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New York Five''' refers to a group of five [[New York City]] [[architect]]s ([[Peter Eisenman]], [[Michael Graves]], [[Charles Gwathmey]], [[John Hejduk]] and [[Richard Meier]]) whose photographed work was the subject of a CASE (Committee of Architects for the Study of the Environment) meeting at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], organized by [[Arthur Drexler]] and [[Colin Rowe]] in 1969, and featured in the subsequent book ''Five Architects'', published by Wittenborn in 1972, then more famously by Oxford Press in 1975.&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{Citation

These five had a common allegiance to a pure form of architectural [[modernism]], harking back to the work of [[Le Corbusier]] in the 1920s and 1930s, although on closer examination their work was far more individual.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt;  The grouping may have had more to do with social and academic allegiances, particularly the mentoring role of [[Philip Johnson]].

The book evoked a stinging rebuke in the May 1973 issue of ''[[Architectural Forum]]'', a group of essays called "Five on Five", written by architects [[Romaldo Giurgola]], [[Allan Greenberg]], [[Charles Willard Moore|Charles Moore]], [[Jaquelin T. Robertson]], and [[Robert A. M. Stern]].&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt;  These five architects [Guirgola et al.], known as the "Greys", attacked the "Whites" [Eisenmann et al.] on the grounds that this pursuit of the pure modernist aesthetic resulted in unworkable buildings that were indifferent to site, indifferent to users, and divorced from daily life.  These "Grays" were aligned with [[Philadelphia]] architect [[Robert Venturi]] and the emerging interest in [[vernacular architecture]], [[New Classical Architecture]] and early [[postmodernism]].  In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Eisenman and Robertson were in partnership, though they designed and credited their work separately.

John Hejduk, the oldest of the five, is known as a pedagogue and the visionary composer of drawings, buildings, poetry, and theoretical writings from the mid-1950s on. Charles Gwathmey is known for his prolific practice (a partnership with Robert Siegel).  While Gwathmey remained true to modernist style, the purity of his work is tempered by the evolving capital realities of corporate and public commissions. Meier is similarly prolific, yet known best for a continuous refinement of the purist voyage on which they initially embarked.  Meier's buildings remain truest to the modernist aesthetic and especially to a neo-Corbusian form.  Eisenman, the most printed writer of the five was perhaps the one who best navigated the line between theory and practice.  And along with this navigation came infamy as a critic.  Eisenman is associated with [[Deconstructivism]].  Graves defected from modernism; he was the first to disavow his relationship with the others and he has worked subsequently as a [[post-modern]] architect.

'''The Twelve Imams''' are the spiritual and political successors to the [[Islam]]ic prophet [[Muhammad]] in the [[Twelver]] or ''Athnā‘ashariyyah'' branch of [[Shia Islam]], including that of the [[Alawite]] and the [[Alevi]] sects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Olsson|Ozdalga|Raudvere|2005|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the [[theology of Twelvers]], also the Twelve Imams are exemplary human individuals who not only rule over the community with justice, but also are able to keep and interpret ''[[sharia]]'' and the [[Esoteric interpretation of the Quran|esoteric meaning of the Quran]]. Muhammad and Imams' [[Sunnah|words and deeds]] are a guide and model for the community to follow; as a result, they must be free from error and sin (known as ''[[ismah]]'', or infallibility) and must be chosen by divine decree, or ''[[Nass (Islam)|nass]]'', through the Prophet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tabataba'i|1977|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Momen|1985|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Twelvers1 copy copy.png|thumb|Calligraphic representation of the Twelve Imams along with that of the Prophet Muhammad.]]
==The belief of Imamah==
{{main|Imamate (Twelver doctrine)}}
It is believed in [[Twelver]] [[Shia Islam]] that [[Aql (Shiasm)|‘aql]], divine wisdom, is the source of the souls of the Prophets and Imams and gives them esoteric knowledge called ''[[Hikmah]]'' and that their sufferings are a means of divine grace to their devotees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tabataba'i|1977|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corbin|2014|pp=45–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Imam is not the recipient of a [[wahy|divine revelation]], he has a close relationship with [[Allah|God]], through which God guides him, and the Imam in turn guides the people. The Imams are also guided by secret texts in their possession, such as [[Al-Jafr (book)|al-Jafr]] and [[al-Jamia]]. [[Imamate]], or belief, in the divine guide is a fundamental belief in the Twelver Shia doctrine and is based on the concept that God would not leave humanity without access to divine guidance.&lt;ref name="Imamat"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia of Islam and the Muslim world; vol.1  | last = Gleave | first = Robert | title=Imamate | publisher = MacMillan | ISBN = 0-02-865604-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Twelvers, there is at all times an Imam of the era who is the divinely appointed authority on all matters of faith and law in the Muslim community. [[Ali]] was the first of the Twelve Imams, and, in the Twelvers and Sufis' view, the [[Succession to Muhammad|rightful successor to Muhammad]], followed by male [[descendants of Muhammad]] through his daughter [[Fatimah]]. Each Imam was the son of the previous Imam, with the exception of [[Husayn ibn Ali]], who was the brother of [[Hasan ibn Ali]]. The twelfth and final Imam is [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]], who is believed by the Twelvers to be currently alive, and hidden in [[The Occultation#Major Occultation|the Major Occultation]] until he returns to bring justice to the world.&lt;ref name="Imamat" /&gt; It is believed by [[Twelver]] [[Shia]] and [[Alevi]] [[Muslims]] that the Twelve Imams have been foretold in the [[Hadith of the Twelve Successors]]. All of the Imams met unnatural deaths, with the exception of the last Imam, who according to Twelver and Alevi belief, is living in occultation.

The Twelve Imams also have a leading role within some [[Sufism|Sufi]] orders and are seen as the spiritual heads of Islam, because most of the [[Silsila]] ''(spiritual chain)'' of Sufi orders lead back to one of the Twelve Imams.

The '''Council of Twelve Men''' was a group of 12 men, chosen on 29 August 1641 by the residents of [[New Netherland]] to advise the [[Director-General of New Netherland|Director of New Netherland]], [[Willem Kieft]], on relations with the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] due to the murder of Claes Swits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jacobs  |first=Jaap  |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=New Netherland: A Dutch Colony In Seventeenth-Century America |year=2005  |publisher= |quote=Both in the way it was set up and in the extent of its rights, the council of Twelve Men, as did the two later advisory bodies ... | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uex2budtSOUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA136&amp;dq |isbn=90-04-12906-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the council was not permanent, it was the first representational form of democracy in the Dutch colony.

==Three Questions==
#Whatever it is not just to punish the barbarous murder of Claes Swits committed by an Indian and, in case the Indians refuse to surrender the murderer at our request, whether it is not justifiable to ruin the entire village to which he belongs?
#In what manner the same ought be put into effect and at what time?
#By whom it may be undertaken?

==War==
They did not counsel war, as desired by [[Willem Kieft]]. They proposed a friendly request to be sent to the Indians to surrender the murderer. Displeased  with the reply of the council of twelve, he disassembled the council on February 8, 1643.Kieft then ordered the [[Dutch West India Company]] soldiers to attack nearby Indian encampments at [[Pavonia, New Netherland|Pavonia]] and [[Cherry Street (Manhattan)|Corlears Hook]]. Escalating attacks and retaliations by the Indians and the Dutch West India Company soldiers during the next two years became known as [[Kieft's War]] and led to a near devastation of the [[New Netherland]] settlements on [[Staten Island]], [[Long Island]], and at [[Pavonia, New Netherland|Pavonia]]. [[Rensselaerswyck]], a [[patroonship]], outside the territory of the [[Lenape]] was unscathed, and profited from the conflict.

'''Winamac''' was the name of a number of [[Potawatomi]] leaders and warriors beginning in the late 17th century. The name derives from a man named Wilamet, a Native American from an eastern tribe who in 1681 was appointed to serve as a liaison between [[New France]] and the natives of the [[Lake Michigan]] region. Wilamet was adopted by the Potawatomis, and his name, which meant "Catfish" in his native [[Eastern Algonquian]] language, was soon transformed into "Winamac", which means the same thing in the [[Potawatomi language]]. The Potawatomi version of the name has been spelled in a variety of ways, including Winnemac, Winamek, and Winnemeg.

The Winamac name became associated with prominent members of the Fish clan of the Potawatomi tribe. In 1701, Winamac or Wilamet was a chief of the Potawatomi villages along the [[St. Joseph River (Lake Michigan)|St. Joseph River]] in what is now the U.S. state of [[Michigan]]. This man or another of the same name was an ally of New France who helped negotiate an end to the [[Fox Wars]] in the 1730s. Two other Winamacs were prominent during the [[War of 1812]]. One was active opponent of the United States, while the other was a U.S. ally. These two Winamacs have often been confused with each other.

== Wilamet ==
In 1681, a group of Native Americans from several [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes of [[New England]] accompanied French explorer [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] on an expedition to the west.&lt;ref name="Clifton, 19-20"&gt;Clifton, 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt; One of these Natives, Wilamet (or Ouilamette or Wilamek), was appointed by La Salle to serve as a laison between [[New France]] and the natives of the [[Lake Michigan]] region.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilamet was adopted by the [[Potawatomi]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Susan Sleeper-Smith, ''Indian Women and French Men: Rethinking Cultural Encounter in the Western Great Lakes'' (Amherst: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 2001), 175n35.&lt;/ref&gt; and his name, which meant "Catfish" in his native [[Eastern Algonquian]] language, was eventually transformed into "Winamac", which means the same thing in the [[Potawatomi language]].&lt;ref name="Clifton, 19-20"/&gt; Before long, he was recognized by the French as the "chief" of the Potawatomi villages along the [[St. Joseph River (Lake Michigan)|St. Joseph River]] in what is now the U.S. state of [[Michigan]].&lt;ref name="Clifton, 78"&gt;Clifton, 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilamet was therefore not a traditional Potawatomi leader (or ''okama''&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 57.&lt;/ref&gt;), but was instead a "chief" appointed by the French.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 85-86.&lt;/ref&gt; French-appointed chiefs were a common feature of the [[Franco-Indian alliance]]. According to historian [[Richard White (historian)|Richard White]], "as the French singled out certain leaders to be the channels by which French power entered the villages, they created a new kind of chief which can best be distinguished as an alliance chief".&lt;ref&gt;White, 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilamet helped La Salle promote French policies while countering [[Iroquois]] influence in the Lake Michigan region.&lt;ref name="Clifton, 78"/&gt; In 1694, a man named Ouilamek, probably the same Wilamet, led 30 Potawatomis in an expedition under [[Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac|Cadillac]] against the Iroquois.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1701, Wilamet and [[Onanghisse]] (or Onangizes), another prominent Potawatomi alliance chief,&lt;ref&gt;White, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; represented the Potawatomis at the great [[Treaty of Montreal]], which ended the war with the Iroquois.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Fox Wars]] (1712–1733), a Wilamek was a leader of the Fish clan of the St. Joseph Potawatomis.&lt;ref name="Clifton, 89"&gt;Clifton, 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian David Edmunds portrays this man as the same one who had attended the 1701 treaty, although Richard White writes that a Wilamek of this era was of a man of [[Sauk people|Sauk]] and [[Meskwaki]] (Fox) parentage who had married into the Potawatomi tribe.&lt;ref&gt;White, 171.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1719, Wilamek traveled to Montreal with a group of Meskwaki leaders in an effort to make peace.&lt;ref name="Clifton, 89"/&gt; The following year, his son was captured by the Meskwakis, but he was later released.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 89; Edmunds, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==War of 1812 era==
{{further|Indiana in the War of 1812|Illinois Territory in the War of 1812}}
During the [[War of 1812]] era, the Potawatomis, like other tribes, were divided over whether to oppose the expansion of the United States or to seek peaceful accommodation. Two men named Winamac were prominent in this era. One was an active opponent of the United States, while the other became a U.S. ally. These two men have often been confused with each other.&lt;ref name="Edmunds, 307n66"&gt;Edmunds, 307n66.&lt;/ref&gt; American historians have often distinguished them by referring to the "anti-American" or "hostile" Winamek and the "pro-American" or "friendly" Winamek.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 528; Edmunds, 307n66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-American Winamac===
The "anti-American" Winamac was a Potawatomi leader who first appears in the historical record in 1810. That year, while returning from an unsuccessful raid against the [[Osage people|Osages]], Winamac's party stole horses from some white Illinois settlers. The settlers pursued the raiders, and the Potawatomis attacked, killing four men. Governor [[Ninian Edwards]] demanded that the Potawatomis surrender the raiders, but chief [[Chief Gomo|Gomo]] informed U.S. officials that the raiders had gone to [[Prophetstown (village)|Prophetstown]] in Indiana, headquarters of the anti-American resistance movement led by the [[Tenskwatawa|Shawnee Prophet]] and his brother [[Tecumseh]].&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, 172-73.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with chiefs [[Shabbona]] and [[Waubonsie]], Winamac led the Potawatomi contingent against the Americans at the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]] at Prophetstown in 1811.&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

Winamac began the organization for the 1812 [[siege of Fort Wayne]]. Late in August, Winamac called together a war party from northern Indiana and Michigan. First attempting to convince Captain Rhea of their friendly intent, they sought entry to the post. Rebuffed, on August 28, 1812 the warriors killed a clerk who left the post for the Ohio.  What followed were occasional firing of outbuildings and shots aimed at any and all movement seen from the outside. On September 4, Winamac approached under a flag of truce.  Making no offer, Winamac found the fort susceptible to attack. The next day, two soldiers were killed outside the fort.  Late in the afternoon, Winamac approached the fort with a small delegation and sought admittance to see the commander.  Inside, they were heavily guarded, ending their ploy to kill the commander and attack from inside. The following day, September 6, saw the greatest action in the siege, but without help, the fort could not be taken. On September 11, a relief column under Governor Harrison arrived from Piqua and the siege ended.

After the siege of Fort Wayne, Winamac served as a scout under British Indian agent [[Matthew Elliott (loyalist)|Matthew Elliott]]. On November 22, 1812, Winamac was with a scouting party that captured several Indians, including Shawnee chief Logan ([[Spemica Lawba]]), a U.S. ally. Winamac was killed in an exchange of gunfire when Logan and his companions escaped; Logan died later from his wounds.&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pro-American Winamac===
The "pro-American" Winamek was a chief from the Tippecanoe Potawatomi on the Wabash.  Beginning in 1807 he and [[Five Medals]] and [[Topinabee (I)|Topinabee]] continued to ask the American government for agricultural help.  The equipment that was sent was never used, as only these chiefs were interested in agriculture, not their people.  In 1807, President Monroe wanted to acquire more Indian land.  A council was called at [[Fort Wayne]] in September.  Winamac led the Potawatomi delegation. When the other chiefs and the Miami refused to negotiate land cessions, it was Winamac who persuaded first the Miami and then the Potawatomi to agree to the cession.  When {{convert|3|e6acre|km2}} were agreed to, none were lands of the Potawatomi.  Winamac and the Potawatomi received a generous share of the payment for these lands.  The months following the treaty found Winamac at Detroit settling disputes for the lands in northwest Ohio.  Because of the Fort Wayne Treaty, discontent was growing and the number of warriors at Prophetstown was increasing.  Winamac provide information to Governor Harrison on the plans and activities at Prophetstown.  Harrison invited the Prophet to Washington and in June, Tecumseh led a delegation to Vincennes to meet with Harrison.  Here, [[Tecumseh]] denounced Winamac as a 'black dog' for supporting the American interests.&lt;ref name=McPherson&gt;'''Indian Names in Indiana''' by Alan McPherson, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the winter of 1811-1812, Potawatomi raids were launched against settlements in southern Indiana and Illinois.  To end the destruction, councils where held at [[Cahokia]] and [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]]. Winamac and Five Medals assured the agents that the few anti-American warriors were not representative of the Potawatomi. Because of the influence of the pro-British chiefs, Winamac and Five Medals refused a trip to Washington. Tecumseh the [[Shawnee]] spoke at the council blaming Winamac and Five Medals for not controlling their warriors.  When [[William Henry Harrison|Gov. Harrison]] marched north to [[Prophetstown State Park|Prophetstown]] on the [[Tippecanoe River|Tippecanoe]] in November 1811, Winamac marched with him.  When they were a short march from Prophetstown, Winamac went ahead to talk with the Prophet.  Winamac returned south to meet Harrison, but was on the far side of the Wabash and passed him by.  On the night of November 6, Gov. Harrison encamped for the night, planning on entering Prophetstown the next day.  When the sun rose, the confederacy had surrounded the troops.  The Potawatomi were led by [[Shabbona]] with [[Waubonsie|Waubansee]] and Winamac (2nd another chief among the Potawatomi).  The defeat of the Indian confederacy scattered the tribes to their home villages.  The dispersal of the Indian confederacy did not end the raids among the settlements.  Tension was so bad, even Winamac was warned to stay out of the settlements.  His unfailing support of the Americans would not protect him from harm.&lt;ref name="McPherson"/&gt;

When the war between the United States and England was known, Winamac continued to support the Americans and led a delegation to the Lake Peoria villages seeking the warriors accused of raiding the settlements.  He was ridiculed by the Potawatomi warriors and left unsuccessful. It was Winamac who carried William Hulls orders from Detroit to Fort Dearborn (Chicago) to evacuate, an attack was eminent. Winamac told Commander Heald that they must leave that day to save themselves, this was on August 9. On August 13, an escort of 13 Miami Indians arrived.  On August 15, Mad Sturgeon and Blackbird led the Potawatomi ambush of 500+ warriors against the 62 soldiers and 27 civilians in the dunes of Lake Michigan.  Fifty-three of the Americans died that day. Fifteen of the Indians died.&lt;ref name="McPherson"/&gt; [[Fort Dearborn]] fell on August 15, 1812 to an ambush, then Mackinac. These were followed by the siege of Detroit, which surrendered to the British on August 16.

In September 1817, Winamac and [[Metea]] represented the eastern Potawatomis at the [[treaty of Fort Meigs]], in which they sold lands in Ohio and south central Michigan to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Winamac died in 1821.&lt;ref name="Edmunds, 307n66"/&gt;

'''Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker''' (abbreviated to '''ZAZ''') were an American comedy filmmaking trio consisting of [[Jim Abrahams]] and brothers [[David Zucker (filmmaker)|David Zucker]] and [[Jerry Zucker (film director)|Jerry Zucker]] who specialized in writing [[slapstick comedy]] films during the 1980s. The trio knew each other during their childhood years, growing up in [[Shorewood, Wisconsin]] and attending [[Shorewood High School (Wisconsin)|Shorewood High School]] which is sometimes referenced in their work. While attending the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], the trio founded a small theater known as The Kentucky Fried Theater in 1971 which led to their [[sketch comedy]] film ''[[The Kentucky Fried Movie]]''.

This was followed in 1980 by the trio's breakout hit ''[[Airplane!]]'', which remains a revered comedic milestone. Subsequent collaborations include the TV series ''[[Police Squad!]]'', its subsequent ''[[The Naked Gun|Naked Gun]]'' trilogy and the films ''[[Top Secret!]]'' and ''[[Ruthless People]]''. All of their projects relied heavily on [[Parody|parodies]], [[visual gag]]s and [[Fourth wall|breaking of the fourth wall]], and established a strong cult following. The notable stylistic exception is ''Ruthless People'', a more traditional farce that was directed by the trio but unlike their other productions, not written by them.

Prominent ZAZ actors and actresses include [[Leslie Nielsen]], [[Lloyd Bridges]], [[Robert Stack]], [[Rowan Atkinson]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]] and [[Charlie Sheen]]. The trio's status as a three-person team of co-directors is highly unusual, although some of their later projects were directed by David Zucker working solo and with Jerry Zucker and Abrahams credited only as producers and/or writers. Each member of the group also had individual solo careers:

* David Zucker directed ''[[BASEketball]]'', ''[[My Boss's Daughter]]'', ''[[Scary Movie 3]]'' and ''[[Scary Movie 4|4]]''.
* Abrahams directed ''[[Hot Shots!]]'' and ''[[Mafia!|Jane Austen's Mafia!]]''.
* Jerry Zucker directed ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'', ''[[First Knight]]'' and ''[[Rat Race (film)|Rat Race]]''. Of the three, Jerry Zucker has found the most mainstream non-comedic success including ''Ghost'' and ''First Knight'', which grossed $505 million and $127 million worldwide respectively.

==Filmography==
&lt;!--Do NOT add Police Squad! It's a TV show, not an actual film. Also do NOT add the Naked Gun movies. They were not directed by ZAZ, only written. Thank you.!--&gt;
Below is a filmography chart on which films the trio have directed together and solo:
