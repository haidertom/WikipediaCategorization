      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1851">An '''ancient language''' is any [[language]] originating in times that may be referred to as ancient. There is no formal criterion for deeming a language ancient, but a traditional convention is to demarcate as "ancient" those languages that existed prior to the 5th century.&lt;ref name="Woodward"&gt;Roger D. Woodard, ''The Ancient Languages of Europe'' (2008), p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist Roger Woodward has said that "[p]erhaps, then, what makes an ancient language different is our awareness that it has outlived those for whom it was an intimate element of the psyche".&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt;

By this definition, the term includes languages attested from ancient times in the [[list of languages by first written accounts]], and described in [[historical linguistics]], and particularly the languages of [[classical antiquity]], such as [[Tamil language]], [[Ancient Greek]], [[Hebrew language]], [[Old Persian]], [[Avestan]], [[Middle Persian]], [[Sanskrit language]],  [[Chinese language]], [[Latin]], [[Arabic language]]. The term may also encompass other [[classical language]]s and various [[extinct language]]s.

==Popular culture==
The description of fictional races and realms having their own "ancient languages" adds depth and richness to storytelling, even if the vocabulary and grammar of the languages themselves is never provided.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Conley and Stephen Cain, ''Encyclopedia of Fictional and Fantastic Languages'' (2006), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this include a fictional language in the ''[[Inheritance Cycle]]'' young-adult novels, the language of the race called [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancients]] in the [[Mythology of Stargate]], and various languages in writings by J.R.R. Tolkien.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6858">An '''authors' conference''' or '''writers' conference''' is a type of [[:wikt:conference|conference]] where [[writers]] gather to review their [[writing|written works]] and suggest improvements. This process helps an author improve his or her work and learn to be a better writer for future works, both by receiving [[critique]]s of their own work and by [[mentoring]] the work of the other authors. Writers may also benefit from meeting and hearing from professionals in related fields, such as agents, editors, illustrators, publishers, and providers of other relevant services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.writersdigest.com/editor-blogs/guide-to-literary-agents/literary-agents-explain-why-they-attend-conferences-and-its-not-what-you-think|work=Writers Digest|author=Hoffman, Scott Hoffman | title=Literary Agents Explain Why They Attend Conferences (And It's Not What You Think)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most other conference styles, an authors' conference is very [[participatory]]. Most conferences are divided into [[presentation]]s, each of which has a clear separation of roles among a one or more [[Public speaker|presenter]]s and an audience. While authors' conferences may include some such presentations, writers' conferences also include numerous sessions wherein an author does not present his or her work but rather listens while the other participants discuss the work. In this way, the author gains an understanding of what readers learn by reading the work.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

An authors' conference consists of two phases, shepherding and writers' workshops. Shepherding usually (but not always&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/thewritingcenter-ce/conference |website=Hunter.CUNY.edu |title=Writers' Conference and Intensives: Hunter College's 4th Annual Writers' Conference |date=June 7, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714220817/http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/thewritingcenter-ce/conference |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }} Intensive writing workshops precede the conference.&lt;/ref&gt;) occurs before the conference meeting, and the meeting itself is organized as a writers' workshop.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

One popular series of authors' conferences is the [[Pattern Languages of Programming]] conferences, held to encourage and assist authors of [[software design pattern]]s and [[pattern language]]s.

==Shepherding==
The shepherding process occurs before the conference meeting. Authors submit papers for the conference, then each paper is assigned to a shepherd, an experienced author who works with the submitter to improve his or her paper. The process often consists of three iterations in as many weeks where the shepherd makes suggestions for improvement and the submitter incorporates the suggestions. This one-on-one mentoring using the submitter's unfinished work as an example is very effective for teaching the submitter how to be a better writer, although its effectiveness is ultimately determined by the participants' dedication and their working relationship. At the end of the shepherding process, the shepherd recommends whether to accept the submission for review at the conference. An accepted submission should meet minimal quality standards for effective evaluation in the writers' workshop, and should have been improved significantly by the submitter during the shepherding process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writers' workshop==
The writers' workshop process occurs during the conference meeting. The workshop consists of 6–10 sessions, one per submission to be reviewed. The workshop participants are the authors of those submissions and any other reviewers the authors choose to accept. In a session, the authors of the submission listen quietly while the other participants discuss what they liked about the submission and suggest improvements. This gives the authors of the submission insight into what information readers are learning from the work and ideas for improving the work. Reviewers discussing a work are careful to make productive comments, both because the author is listening and because in other sessions that author will become the reviewer and make comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Boeraans''' is a dialect of [[Afrikaans]] which is one of the 11 official languages in South Africa, and is one of the youngest Germanic languages with official status.

Boeraans was also known as "Die Taal" (meaning "The Language). The Border Boers moved from the Western Cape to the Eastern Cape, and stayed there.

In 1820, the Boers moved to the region known as the [[Free State Province]] in South Africa and Transvaal (now the provinces of Limpopo, Mpumalanga, Gauteng and a part of North West) in South Africa.

:Person B: Bathroom?
:Person A: Yes, thank you.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3249">'''Cognitive synonymy''' is a type of [[synonym]]y in which synonyms are so similar in [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] that they cannot be differentiated either [[denotation|denotatively]] or [[connotation|connotatively]], that is, not even by [[association of ideas|mental associations]], [[connotation]]s, emotive responses, and [[poetry|poetic value]]. It is a stricter (more precise) technical definition of synonymy, specifically for theoretical (e.g., [[linguistics|linguistic]] and [[philosophical]]) purposes. In [[usage]] employing this definition, synonyms with greater differences are often called near-synonyms rather than synonyms.&lt;ref name="Stanojević_2009"&gt;{{Citation |last=Stanojević |first=Maja |year=2009 |title= Cognitive synonymy: a general overview |journal=Facta Universitatis, Linguistics and Literature series |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=193-200 |url=http://facta.junis.ni.ac.rs/lal/lal200902/lal200902-05.pdf |doi= |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
If a word is cognitively synonymous with another word, they refer to the same thing independently of [[context (language use)|context]]. Thus, a word is cognitively synonymous with another word [[if and only if]] all instances of both words express the same exact thing, and the referents are [[modal logic|necessarily]] [[identity (philosophy)|identical]], which means that the words' interchangeability is not [[wikt:context-sensitive|context-sensitive]].

[[Willard Van Orman Quine]] used the concept of cognitive synonymy extensively in his famous 1951 paper "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]", where two words were cognitively synonymous if they were interchangeable in every possible instance.&lt;ref name="Hanna_2005"&gt;{{Citation |last=Hanna |first=Patricia |year=2005 |title=''Cognitive Synonymy'', from Notes on "Two Dogmas of Empiricism" |url=http://www.hum.utah.edu/~phanna/classes/ling5030/webpostings/notestwodogmas/node14.html |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=""&gt;{{Citation |last=Quine |first=Willard Van Orman |year=1951 |title=Two dogmas of empiricism |journal=The Philosophical Review |volume=60 |issue= |pages=20–43 |url=http://www.ditext.com/quine/quine.html |doi= |postscript=. Reprinted in his 1953 book ''From a Logical Point of View''. Harvard University Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example,
* All bachelors are unmarried men.
* All unmarried men are not married.

Quine notes that if one is [[use-mention distinction|referring to the word itself]], this doesn't apply, as in,
* ''Bachelor'' has fewer than ten letters.

As compared to the substitution which is obviously false,
* "Unmarried men" has less than ten letters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3345">[[File:Brahmi Kya (Ka-Ya) conjunct consonant.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|"Kya" (Ka+Ya) conjunct consonant in the [[Brahmi script]], consisting in the vertical assembly of consonants "Ka" [[File:Brahmi k.svg|12px]] and "Ya" [[File:Brahmi y.svg|12px]]. Used in the spelling of the word "[[Shakyas|Shakyamuni]]" to designate the [[Buddha]], [[Lumbini|Rummindei pillar]] of [[Ashoka]] (circa 250 BCE).]]
'''Conjunct consonants''' are a type of letters, used for example in [[Brahmi script|Brahmi]] or modern [[Devanagari]], to write [[consonant cluster]]s such as {{IPA|/pr/}} or {{IPA|/rv/}}. Although most of the time, letters are formed by using a simple consonant with the inherent value vowel "a" (as with "k" [[File:Brahmi k.svg|12px]], pronounced "ka" in Brahmi), or by combining a consonant with an vowel in the form of an [[diacritic]] (as with "ki" [[File:Brahmi letter Ki.svg|12px]] in Brahmi), the usage of conjunct consonant permits the creation of more sophisticated sounds (as with "kya" [[File:Brahmi Kya.jpg|12px]], formed with the consonants k [[File:Brahmi k.svg|10px]] and y [[File:Brahmi y.svg|10px]] assembled verticaly).&lt;ref name=MC/&gt; Conjuncts are often used with loan words. Native words typically use the basic consonant and native speakers know to suppress the vowel.

In modern Devanagari the components of a conjunct are written left to right when possible (when the first consonant has a vertical stem that can be removed at the right), whereas in Brahmi characters are joined vertically downwards.&lt;ref name=MC&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shapiro |first1=Michael C. |title=A Primer of Modern Standard Hindi |date=1989 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |isbn=9788120805088 |page=23 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vvuP8sD1wloC&amp;pg=PA23 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some simple examples of conjunct consonants in Devanagari are: त + व = त्व tva, ण + ढ = ण्ढ ṇḍha, स + थ = स्थ stha, where the vertical stroke of the first letter is simply lost in the combination. Sometimes, conjunct consonants are not clearly derived from the letters making up their components: the conjunct for kṣ is क्ष (क् + ष) and for jñ it is ज्ञ (ज् + ञ). 

Conjunct consonants are used in many other scripts as well, usually derived from the Brahmi script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tuṅga |first1=Sudhāṃśu Śekhara |title=Bengali and Other Related Dialects of South Assam |date=1995 |publisher=Mittal Publications |isbn=9788170995883 |page=163 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lRRYBHQvXdsC&amp;pg=PA163 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Balinese script|Balinese]], conjunct consonants are called ''Haksara Wrehastra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shadeg |first1=Norbert |title=Tuttle Balinese-English Dictionary |date=2014 |publisher=Tuttle Publishing |isbn=9781462910786 |page=11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=20ktBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conjunct consonant are not limited to Brahmic languages, and can be seen in [[Navajo language|Navajo]] for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McDonough |first1=J.

A '''counterword''' (also spelled '''counter word''' and '''counter-word''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordsmyth.net/?level=3&amp;ent=counterword+|title=Wordsmyth Dictionary|website=wordsmyth.net}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/counterword?r=66|title=the definition of counterword|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a word such as ''"so"'' that is frequently used to answer ("counter") in a reflex-like manner and that has due to this frequent use quickly taken on a new, much less specific or much looser meaning or is even almost meaningless or performs a completely new function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.infoplease.com/counterword|title=Meaning of counterword |website=InfoPlease}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/counterword|title=Counterword definition and meaning |website=Collins English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "so", for example, is frequently used to begin an answer in the sense of "Well,..." or to function as an indirect way of saying "Before answering that, I'd like to..." or even instead of saying "On the contrary,..." or "No, I...".

In a more general sense, the term is used for such words also when they are not used as a reflex-like answer and even for any widely used words that (due to a similar change) now have a broad and vague range of meanings in many very different situations (e.g. case, awfully, fix, job, payoff).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i.word.com/idictionary/counterword+|title=Definition of COUNTERWORD|website=i.word.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since such change due to very frequent use occurs much more rapidly than the change in meaning all words go through, and since such words are even sometimes still simultaneously used in their original sense, the new usage is often considered incorrect by some speakers. Other examples include ''nice'', ''terrific'', ''terrible'', ''awful'', ''tremendous'', ''swell'', ''hopefully'' and ''very fine'' (degrading the meaning of ''fine'' to "OK").

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' does not support this and defines counter-word as "countersign", noting that its usage is military and obsolete with a single quotation from 1678.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/43064?redirectedFrom=counterword#eid "counter-word"], ''Oxford English Dictionary''.

It was the term used for the court or [[Levee (ceremony)|levee]] of the prince; an audience chamber&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=70SHv0axVTwC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;lpg=PA305&amp;dq=darbar+meaning+in+details&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_sbS78GiK5&amp;sig=biSOgEcPU31xi3JEd330ihqKHR4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZ6cnE3dzVAhWBXRQKHUa5BS04ChDoAQhaMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=darbar%20meaning%20in%20details&amp;f=false Islam and politics in Afghanstan]&lt;/ref&gt; or a place where Muslim Kings and other rulers had their formal and informal meetings, i.e. in European context, equivalent to a king's court.

Darbar is a Persian-derived term (from Persian: دربار - darbār) meaning the court or place of discussion of king, Prince, ruler or noble court. It was later used in [[Pakistan]], India and [[Nepal]] for a ruler's court or feudal levee as the latter came to be ruled and later administered by foreigners. A darbar may be either a [[feudal]] state council for administering the affairs of a princely state, or a [[Muslim]] [[shrine]] like [[Data Darbar|data darbar]] in [[Lahore]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2400">In [[linguistics]] and in particular in [[natural language understanding]], a '''dialog act''' is an utterance, in the context of a conversational dialog, that serves a function in the dialog. Types of dialog acts include a question, a statement, or a request for action.&lt;ref name="McTear2016"&gt;{{cite book |last1=McTear |first1=Michael |last2=Callejas |first2=Zoraida |last3=Griol |first3=David |title=The Conversational Interface: Talking to Smart Devices |date=2016 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783319329673 |pages=162-166 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X_w0DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA164&amp;dq=%22Dialog+act%22+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi8kqaEirHbAhVxFjQIHUPADJ0Q6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Dialog%20act%22%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false |accessdate=31 May 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dialog acts are a type of  [[speech act]]. 

Dialog act recognition, also known as spoken utterance classification, is an important part of spoken language understanding. AI inference models or statistical models are used to recognize and classify dialog acts.&lt;ref name="McTear2016" /&gt;

A [[dialog system]] typically includes a taxonomy of dialog types or ''tags'' that classify the different functions dialog acts can play.  One study had 42 types of dialog act in their taxonomy.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of types in this study include ''STATEMENT'', ''OPINION'', ''AGREEMENT/ACCEPT'', and ''YES-NO-QUESTION''. 

The research on dialog acts have increased since 1999, after [[spoken dialog systems]] became commercial reality.

The technical term '''direction of fit''' is used to describe the distinctions that are offered by two related sets of opposing terms:{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}
* The more general set of '''mind-to-world''' (i.e., '''mind-to-fit-world''', not '''from-mind-to-world''') ''vs.'' '''world-to-mind'''{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} (i.e., '''world-to-fit-mind''') used by [[philosophy of mind|philosophers of mind]],{{Who|date=December 2012}} and
* The narrower, more specific set, '''word-to-world'''&lt;ref&gt;[[John Searle]], ''Intentionality: An Essay in the Philosophy of Mind'', Cambridge University Press, 1983, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e., '''word-to-fit-world''') ''vs.'' '''world-to-word''' {{citation needed|date=December 2012}} (i.e., '''world-to-fit-word''') used by advocates of [[Speech act|speech act theory]].{{Who|date=December 2012}}

==In general==

In philosophy of mind, a [[belief]]  has a '''mind-to-world''' direction of fit.&lt;ref&gt;Searle (2001), p.37.&lt;/ref&gt; A belief (that '''p''', say) depicts the world as being in a state of affairs such that '''p''' is true. Beliefs, some philosophers have argued,&lt;ref&gt;Searle (2001), p.37.&lt;/ref&gt; aim at the truth and so aim to fit the world. A belief is satisfied when it fits the world.

A desire, on the other hand, normally expresses a yet to be realized state of affairs and so has a '''world-to-mind''' direction of fit.&lt;ref&gt;Searle (2001), p.37-8.&lt;/ref&gt; A desire that '''p''', unlike a belief, doesn't depict the world as being in the state that '''p'''; rather it expresses a desire that the world be such that '''p''' is true. Desire is a state that is satisfied when the world fits it.

A way to account for the difference is that a (rational) person that holds the belief that '''p''' when confronted with evidence that '''not-p''', will revise his belief, whereas a person that desires that '''p''' can retain his desire that '''p''' in the face of evidence that '''not-p'''.{{Who|date=December 2012}}

To a philosopher of language{{Who|date=December 2012}} a '''word-to-world''' fit occurs when, say, a sports journalist correctly names Jones as a goal scorer; while if the journalist mistakenly names Smith as the goal scorer, the printed account does ''not'' display a '''word-to-world''' fit, and must be altered such that it matches the real world. Conversely, a '''world-to-word''' fit occurs when a fan of Smith's team opines that they deserved to win the match, even though they lost. In this case, the world would have to change to make the sports fan's wish become true.

However, in the case of, say, a judge delivering a [[Capital punishment|death]] [[sentence (law)|sentence]] to a criminal declared [[guilt (law)|guilty]] by a [[jury]], the utterances of the judge ''alter'' the world, through the fact of that utterance;{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} and, in this case, the judge is generating a '''world-to-word-to-world''' fit (see below). So, if the judge's opinion is upheld, the world ''must'' be altered to match the content of the judge's utterance (i.e., the criminal must be executed).

==In medieval philosophy==
According to [[Thomas Aquinas]] (''[[Summa Theologica]]'', Part I, Question 21, Article 2), there are two kinds of "[[truth]]" (''veritas''), both understood as [[correspondence theory of truth|correspondence]] between mind (''intellectus'') or words (''oratio'') and world ("things", ''res''):
{{quotation|Truth consists in the equation of [thing and mind] (''[[adaequatio rei et intellectus]]''), as said above. Now the mind, that is the cause of the thing, is related to it as its rule and measure; whereas the converse is the case with the mind that receives its knowledge from things.&lt;br&gt;
When therefore things are the measure and rule of the mind, truth consists in ''the equation of the mind to the thing'', as happens in ourselves. For according as a thing is, or is not, our thoughts or our words about it are true or false.&lt;br&gt;
But when the mind is the rule or measure of things, truth consists in ''the equation of the thing to the mind''; just as the work of an artist is said to be true, when it is in accordance with his art. Now as works of art are related to art, so are works of justice related to the law with which they accord. Therefore God's justice, which establishes things in the order conformable to the rule of His wisdom, which is the law of His justice, is suitably called truth. Thus we also in human affairs speak of the truth of justice. (''emphasis added to original'')}}

==In speech act theory==
Perhaps the first to speak of a "direction of fit" was the philosopher [[J. L. Austin]]. Austin did not use the distinction between different directions of fit to contrast commands or expressions of intention to assertions, or desires to beliefs. He rather distinguishes different ways of asserting that an item is of a certain type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hennig|first=Boris|title=Two Epistemic Directions of Fit|url=http://www.borishennig.de/texte/2011/dof.pdf|accessdate=4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an extensive discussion&lt;ref&gt;Austin (1953), p.234.&lt;/ref&gt; of the issues involved with the differences between, say, (a) wrongly calling a triangle a square (something which, he said, was committing an act of violence to the language) and (b) wrongly describing a triangular object as being a square (something which, he said, was committing an act of violence to the facts), Austin distinguished between what he termed:
* "'''the onus of match'''": in the case of one wanting to ''match'' X and Y, the distinction between the matching of '''X to Y''' and the matching of '''Y to X'''; and
* "'''the direction of fit'''": in the case of naming something, the difference between the fitting of a '''name to an item''', and the fitting of '''an item to a name'''.

The concept of direction of fit can also apply to [[speech acts]]: e.g., statements, guesses and conjectures have '''word-to-world''' direction of fit, while [[imperative mood|commands]] and promises have a '''world-to-word''' direction of fit.

[[John Searle]] and Daniel Vanderveken&lt;ref&gt;Searle &amp; Vanderveken, (1985), pp.52-53.&lt;/ref&gt; assert that there are only four possible "''directions of fit''" in language:
:'''1. The word-to-world direction of fit'''.
:In achieving success of fit the propositional content of the [[utterance]] fits an independently existing state of affairs in the world. E.g.: "We are married".

:'''2. The world-to-word direction of fit'''.
:To achieve success of fit the world must change to match the propositional content of the utterance. E.g.: "Will you marry me?", "I want to marry him", "You'd just better marry her, buddy!", etc.

:'''3. The double direction of fit'''.
:To achieve success of fit the world is ''thereby'' altered to fit the propositional content by representing the world as being so altered, unlike sense 2. E.g.: "I declare you man and wife". The 'doubled' direction is therefore always world-to-word-to-world. For obvious reasons, Searle calls sentences of this type 'declarations'.

:'''4. The null or empty direction of fit'''.
:There is no direct question of achieving success of fit between the propositional content and the world, because success of fit is presupposed by the utterance. E.g.: "I'm glad I married you" presupposes that the speaker is married to the listener.

Searle used this notion of "''direction of fit''" to create a taxonomy of [[illocutionary act]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See Searle (1975/1976/1979).&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Although [[G. E. M. Anscombe|Elizabeth Anscombe]] never employed the term "the direction of fit", Searle has strongly argued&lt;ref&gt;Searle, 1985, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; that the following passage from her work '''''Intention''''' was, by far, "the best illustration" of the distinction between the tasks of "[getting] the words (more strictly their propositional content) to match the world… [and that of getting] the world to match the words":
{{quotation|§32. Let us consider a man going round a town with a shopping list in his hand. Now it is clear that the relation of this list to the things he actually buys is one and the same whether his wife gave him the list or it is his own list; and that there is a different relation where a list is made by a detective following him about. If he made the list itself, it was an expression of intention; if his wife gave it him, it has the role of an order. What then is the identical relation to what happens, in the order and the intention, which is not shared by the record? It is precisely this: if the list and the things that the man actually buys do not agree, and if this and this alone constitutes a mistake, then the mistake is not in the list but in the man's performance (if his wife were to say: “Look, it says butter and you have bought margarine”, he would hardly reply: “What a mistake! we must put that right” and alter the word on the list to “margarine”); whereas if the detective's record and what the man actually buys do not agree, then the mistake is in the record.&lt;ref&gt;Anscombe, 1963, p.56&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In philosophy of mind==

According to Velleman, when used in the domain of the [[philosophy of mind]], the concept '''direction of fit''' represents the distinguishing feature between two types of [[intentionality|intentional]] [[:wikt:mental state|mental state]]s:

:'''''Facta''''' (singular '''''factum''''', states that currently exist) are states with a mind-to-world direction of fit.
: Examples include [[belief]]s, [[perception]]s, [[hypotheses]], and [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasies]].  In the event of a mismatch between the mental state and the world, the mental state is in some sense false or wrong and should perhaps be changed.

:'''''Facienda''''' (singular '''''faciendum''''', states that are yet to exist) are states with a world-to-mind direction of fit.
:Examples include [[Intentionality|intentions]] and desires.  If there is a mismatch between the mental state and the world, the world is in some sense wrong and should perhaps be changed.

In some forms of [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|mind-body dualism]], a matching ''factum'' and ''faciendum'' must be present in a person's [[mind]] in order for him to [[action (philosophy)|act]] intentionally.  If a person has the belief that action (A) will lead to state (S), and has the desire that state (S) obtain, then he will perform action (A). The action is directly [[Causality|caused]] by simultaneous presence of the two mental states; no further explanation is needed.

According to Velleman:
::''The term "direction of fit" refers to the two ways in which attitudes can relate [[proposition]]s to the world.''
::''In [[cognitive]] attitudes [such as '''belief'''], a proposition is grasped as patterned after the world; whereas in [[Conation|conative]] attitudes [such as '''desire'''], the proposition is grasped as a pattern for the world to follow.''
::''The propositional object of desire is regarded not as fact -- not, that is, as '''factum''', having been brought about -- but rather as '''faciendum''', to be brought about: it's regarded not as true but as to be made true.''&lt;ref&gt;Velleman, (1992), p.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6424">'''Egbert Richter''' (also publishing under the [[pen name]] of '''Richter-Ushanas''', after ''{{IAST|[[Ushanas|uśánas]]}}'', a Vedic [[rishi]]) is a German freelance writer and lecturer, author of [[self-published]] (''Egbert Richter Verlag'', registered in [[Bremen]]) treatises on [[Yoga]], [[Vedanta]], [[Esotericism]] and [[mythology]], translations of some [[Upanishads]], the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]] as well as original poetry. Richter has also published various [[pseudo-scholarly]] claims, including decipherment of the [[Rongorongo]], [[Phaistos Disc decipherment claims|Phaistos Disc]] and [[Indus script]]s.

In his 1992 decipherment claim of the Indus script, he argues that the script is "based very largely on intuition, and this quality is also required for reading it", likening the process of "decipherment" to [[meditation]], concluding that the [[Rbhus]], who Richter alleges were priests of the [[Harappan civilization]], invented the Indus script under the influence of [[Sumerian cuneiform]]. [[Karel Werner|Werner]] (1999) confesses himself "at a loss how to evaluate" Richter's work, admitting the author has thorough knowledge of the various sources he uses, but at the same time completely lacks academic method, discipline or experience.

[[File:Essais     Titelblatt (1588).png|thumb|Essays of [[Michel de Montaigne]]]]
An '''essay''' is, generally, a piece of writing that gives the author's own [[argument]] — but the definition is vague, overlapping with those of a [[term paper|paper]], an [[article (publishing)|article]], a [[pamphlet]], and a [[short story]]. Essays have traditionally been sub-classified as formal and informal. Formal essays are characterized by "serious purpose, dignity, logical organization, length," whereas the informal essay is characterized by "the personal element (self-revelation, individual tastes and experiences, confidential manner), humor, graceful style, rambling structure, unconventionality or novelty of theme," etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holman|first1=William|title=A Handbook to Literature|date=2003|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New Jersey|page=193|edition=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Essays are commonly used as [[literary criticism]], political [[manifestos]], learned [[arguments]], observations of daily life, recollections, and reflections of the author. Almost all  modern essays  are written in [[prose]], but works in [[Poetry|verse]] have been dubbed essays (e.g., [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''[[An Essay on Criticism]]'' and ''[[An Essay on Man]]''). While brevity usually defines an essay, voluminous works like [[John Locke]]'s ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' and [[Thomas Malthus]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' are counterexamples.

In some countries (e.g., the United States and Canada), essays have become a major part of formal [[education]]. Secondary students are taught structured essay formats to improve their writing skills; [[admissions essay|admission essays]] are often used by [[university|universities]] in selecting applicants, and in the humanities and social sciences essays are often used as a way of assessing the performance of students during final exams.

The concept of an "essay" has been extended to other media beyond writing. A [[Essay#Film|film essay]] is a movie that often incorporates documentary filmmaking styles and focuses more on the evolution of a theme or idea. A [[photo essay|photographic essay]] covers a topic with a linked series of [[photographs]] that may have accompanying text or [[Photo caption|captions]].

==Definitions==
[[File:Locke Essay 1690.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Locke]]'s 1690 ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''.]]
An essay has been defined in a variety of ways. One definition is a "prose composition with a focused subject of discussion" or a "long, systematic discourse".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gale.cengage.com/free_resources/glossary/glossary_de.htm Gale – Free Resources – Glossary – DE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425123427/http://www.gale.cengage.com/free_resources/glossary/glossary_de.htm |date=2010-04-25 }}. Gale.cengage.com. Retrieved March 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is difficult to define the genre into which essays fall. [[Aldous Huxley]], a leading essayist, gives guidance on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Aldous Huxley, ''Collected Essays'', "Preface".&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that "the essay is a literary device for saying almost everything about almost anything", and adds that "by tradition, almost by definition, the essay is a short piece". Furthermore, Huxley argues that "essays belong to a literary species whose extreme variability can be studied most effectively within a three-poled frame of reference". 
These three poles (or worlds in which the essay may exist) are:
* The personal and the autobiographical: The essayists that feel most comfortable in this pole "write fragments of reflective autobiography and look at the world through the keyhole of anecdote and description".
* The objective, the factual, and the concrete particular: The essayists that write from this pole "do not speak directly of themselves, but turn their attention outward to some literary or scientific or political theme. Their art consists of setting forth, passing judgment upon, and drawing general conclusions from the relevant data".
* The abstract-universal: In this pole "we find those essayists who do their work in the world of high abstractions", who are never personal and who seldom mention the particular facts of experience.
Huxley adds that the most satisfying essays "...make the best not of one, not of two, but of all the three worlds in which it is possible for the essay to exist."

The word ''essay'' derives from the French infinitive ''essayer'', "to try" or "to attempt".  In English ''essay'' first meant "a trial" or "an attempt", and this is still an alternative meaning.  The Frenchman [[Michel de Montaigne]] (1533–1592) was the first author to describe his work as essays; he used the term to characterize these as "attempts" to put his thoughts into writing, and his essays grew out of his [[commonplacing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/webexhibits/bookusebooktheory/commonplacethinking.html |title=Book Use Book Theory: 1500–1700: Commonplace Thinking |publisher=Lib.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801200451/http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/webexhibits/bookusebooktheory/commonplacethinking.html |archivedate=2013-08-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Inspired in particular by the works of [[Plutarch]], a translation of whose ''Œuvres Morales'' (''Moral works'') into French had just been published by [[Jacques Amyot]], Montaigne began to compose his essays in 1572; the first edition, entitled ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essais]]'', was published in two volumes in 1580.  For the rest of his life, he continued revising previously published essays and composing new ones. [[Francis Bacon]]'s [[Essays (Francis Bacon)|essays]], published in book form in 1597, 1612, and 1625, were the first works in English that described themselves as ''essays''.  [[Ben Jonson]] first used the word ''essayist'' in English in 1609, according to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.

==History==
{{globalize|date=January 2011}}

===Europe===
English essayists included [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]] (1577–1641) and [[Sir Thomas Browne]] (1605–1682). In France, [[Michel de Montaigne]]'s three volume ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essais]]'' in the mid 1500s contain over 100 examples widely regarded as the predecessor of the modern essay. In Italy, [[Baldassare Castiglione]] wrote about courtly manners in his essay ''Il Cortigiano''. In the 17th century, the [[Jesuit]] [[Baltasar Gracián]] wrote about the theme of wisdom.&lt;ref name="britannica1"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/192869/essay essay (literature) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204053246/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/192869/essay |date=2009-12-04 }}. Britannica.com. Retrieved March 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], essays were a favored tool of polemicists who aimed at convincing readers of their position; they also featured heavily in the rise of [[periodical literature]], as seen in the works of [[Joseph Addison]], [[Richard Steele]] and [[Samuel Johnson]]. In the 18th and 19th centuries, [[Edmund Burke]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] wrote essays for the general public. The early 19th century, in particular, saw a proliferation of great essayists in English – [[William Hazlitt]], [[Charles Lamb]], [[James Henry Leigh Hunt|Leigh Hunt]] and [[Thomas de Quincey]] all penned numerous essays on diverse subjects. In the 20th century, a number of essayists tried to explain the new movements in art and culture by using essays (e.g., [[T.S. Eliot]]). Whereas some essayists used essays for strident political themes, [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] and [[Willa Cather]] wrote lighter essays. [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Edmund Wilson]], and [[Charles du Bos]] wrote literary criticism essays.&lt;ref name="britannica1"/&gt;

===Japan===
{{main article|Zuihitsu}}
As with the [[novel]], essays existed in Japan several centuries before they developed in Europe with a genre of essays known as ''zuihitsu'' — loosely connected essays and fragmented ideas. Zuihitsu have existed since almost the beginnings of Japanese literature. Many of the most noted early works of Japanese literature are in this genre. Notable examples include ''[[The Pillow Book]]'' (c. 1000), by court lady [[Sei Shōnagon]], and ''[[Tsurezuregusa]]'' (1330), by particularly renowned Japanese Buddhist monk [[Yoshida Kenkō]]. Kenkō described his short writings similarly to Montaigne, referring to them as "nonsensical thoughts" written in "idle hours". Another noteworthy difference from Europe is that women have traditionally written in Japan, though the more formal, Chinese-influenced writings of male writers were more prized at the time.

==Forms and styles==
This section describes the different forms and styles of essay writing. These forms and styles are used by an array of authors, including university students and professional [[List of essayists|essayists]].

===Cause and effect===
The defining features of a "cause and effect" essay are causal chains that connect from a cause to an effect, careful language, and chronological or emphatic order. A writer using this rhetorical method must consider the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]], determine the [[Intention|purpose]], consider the [[audience]], think critically about different causes or consequences, consider a thesis statement, arrange the parts, consider the [[language]], and decide on a conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 7: Cause and Effect in Glenn, Cheryl. Making Sense: A Real-World Rhetorical Reader. Ed. Denise B. Wydra, et al. Second ed. Boston, MA: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification and division===
Classification is the categorization of objects into a larger whole while division is the breaking of a larger whole into smaller parts.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 5: Classification and Division in Glenn, Cheryl. Making Sense: A Real-World Rhetorical Reader. Ed. Denise B. Wydra, et al. Second ed. Boston, MA: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compare and contrast===
Compare and contrast essays are characterized by a basis for comparison, points of comparison, and analogies. It is grouped by the object (chunking) or by point (sequential). The comparison highlights the similarities between two or more similar objects while contrasting highlights the differences between two or more objects. When writing a compare/contrast essay, writers need to determine their purpose, consider their audience, consider the basis and points of comparison, consider their thesis statement, arrange and develop the comparison, and reach a conclusion. Compare and contrast is arranged emphatically.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 6: Comparison and Contrast in Glenn, Cheryl. Making Sense: A Real-World Rhetorical Reader. Ed. Denise B. Wydra, et al. Second ed. Boston, MA: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expository ===
Expository essay is used to inform, describe or explain a topic, using important facts and teaching reader about the topic. Mostly written in [[Third-person pronoun|third-person]], using "it", "he", "she", "they". Expository essay uses formal language to discuss someone or something. Examples of expository essays are: a medical or biological condition, social or technological process, life or character of a famous person. Writing of expository essay often consists of following next steps: organizing thoughts ([[brainstorming]]), researching a topic, developing a [[thesis statement]], writing the introduction, writing the body of essay, writing the conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nova.edu/tutoring-testing/study-resources/forms/planning-an-expository-essay.pdf|title=Subject Verb Agreement|last=|first=|date=|website=Nova Southeastern University|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expository essays are often assigned as a part of SAT and other standardized testings or as a homework for high school and college students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://writeanypapers.com/blog/expository-essay-writing-steps/|title=How to Write a Good Expository Essay {{!}} WriteAnyPapers|last=|first=|date=17 Jun 2018|website=WriteAnyPapers|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descriptive===
Descriptive writing is characterized by [[sensory perception|sensory]] details, which appeal to the physical senses, and details that appeal to a reader's emotional, physical, or intellectual sensibilities. Determining the purpose, considering the audience, creating a dominant impression, using descriptive language, and organizing the description are the rhetorical choices to consider when using a description. A description is usually arranged spatially but can also be [[chronological]] or emphatic. The focus of a description is the scene. Description uses tools such as [[denotative]] language, [[connotative]] language, [[figurative language]], [[metaphor]], and [[simile]] to arrive at a dominant impression.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 2: Description in Glenn, Cheryl. Making Sense: A Real-World Rhetorical Reader. Ed. Denise B. Wydra, et al. Second ed. Boston, MA: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; One university essay guide states that "descriptive writing says what happened or what another author has discussed; it provides an account of the topic".&lt;ref&gt;Section 2.1 of the Simon Fraser University CNS Essay Handbook. Available online at: [https://www.sfu.ca/cns/PDF/CNS_Essay_Handbook.pdf sfu.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Lyric essay]]s are an important form of descriptive essays.

===Dialectic===
In the [[dialectic]] form of the essay, which is commonly used in [[philosophy]], the writer makes a thesis and argument, then objects to their own argument (with a counterargument), but then counters the counterargument with a final and novel argument. This form benefits from presenting a broader perspective while countering a possible flaw that some may present. This type is sometimes called an ethics paper'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Write-an-Ethics-Paper|title=How to Write an Ethics Paper (with Pictures) - wikiHow|accessdate=2016-07-01|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828152926/http://www.wikihow.com/Write-an-Ethics-Paper|archivedate=2016-08-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exemplification===
An exemplification essay is characterized by a generalization and relevant, representative, and believable examples including [[anecdote]]s. Writers need to consider their subject, determine their purpose, consider their audience, decide on specific examples, and arrange all the parts together when writing an exemplification essay.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 4: Exemplification in Glenn, Cheryl. Making Sense: A Real-World Rhetorical Reader. Ed. Denise B. Wydra, et al. Second ed. Boston, MA: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:An Essay on the Principle of Population.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Robert Malthus|Malthus']] ''[[Essay on the Principle of Population]]'']]

===Familiar===
An essayist writes a ''familiar essay'' if speaking to a single reader, writing about both themselves, and about particular subjects. [[Anne Fadiman]] notes that "the genre's heyday was the early nineteenth century," and that its greatest exponent was [[Charles Lamb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fadiman|first=Anne|author-link=Anne Fadiman|title=At Large and At Small: Familiar Essays|page=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She also suggests that while critical essays have more brain than the heart, and personal essays have more heart than brain, familiar essays have equal measures of both.&lt;ref&gt;Fadiman, ''At Large and At Small'', xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History (thesis)===
A history essay sometimes referred to as a thesis essay describes an argument or claim about one or more historical events and supports that claim with evidence, arguments, and references. The text makes it clear to the reader why the argument or claim is as such.&lt;ref&gt;History Essay Format &amp; Thesis Statement, (February 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Narrative===
A [[narrative]] uses tools such as [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s, [[Flashforward|flash-forwards]], and [[Transition (fiction)|transitions]] that often build to a climax. The focus of a narrative is the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]. When creating a narrative, authors must determine their purpose, consider their audience, establish their point of view, use dialogue, and organize the narrative. A narrative is usually arranged chronologically.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 3 Narration in Glenn, Cheryl. Making Sense: A Real-World Rhetorical Reader. Ed. Denise B. Wydra, et al. Second ed. Boston, MA: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argumentative===
An [[argumentative]] essay is a [[criticism|critical]]  piece of writing, aimed at presenting objective [[analysis]] of the subject matter, narrowed down to a single topic. The main idea of all the criticism is to provide an opinion either of positive or negative implication. As such, a critical essay requires research and analysis, strong internal logic and sharp structure. Its structure normally builds around  introduction with a topic's relevance and a [[thesis statement]], body paragraphs with arguments linking back to the main thesis, and conclusion. In addition, an argumentative essay may include a refutation section where conflicting ideas are acknowledged, described, and criticized. Each [[argument]] of argumentative essay should be supported with sufficient evidence, relevant to the point.

=== Process ===
A process essay is used for an explanation of making or breaking something. Often, it is written in chronological order or numerical order to show step-by-step processes. It has all the qualities of a [[Technical documentation|technical document]] with the only difference is that it is often written in [[Linguistic description|descriptive mood]], while a technical document is mostly in [[imperative mood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://literarydevices.net/process-essay/|title=Process Essay - Examples and Definition of Process Essay|date=2017-04-04|work=Literary Devices|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic===
An [[economic]] essay can start with a thesis, or it can start with a theme. It can take a narrative course and a descriptive course. It can even become an [[argumentative]] essay if the author feels the need. After the introduction, the author has to do his/her best to expose the economic matter at hand, to analyze it, evaluate it, and draw a conclusion. If the essay takes more of a narrative form then the author has to expose each aspect of the economic puzzle in a way that makes it clear and understandable for the reader

===Reflective===
A ''reflective essay'' is an [[analysis|analytical]] piece of writing in which the writer describes a real or imaginary scene, event, interaction, passing thought, memory, or form — adding a personal reflection on the meaning of the topic in the author's life. Thus, the focus is not merely descriptive. The writer doesn’t just describe the situation,  but revisits the scene with more detail and emotion to examine what went well, or reveal a need for additional learning — and may relate what transpired to the rest of the author's life.

===Other logical structures===
The logical progression and organizational structure of an essay can take many forms. Understanding how the movement of thought is managed through an essay has a profound impact on its overall cogency and ability to impress. A number of alternative logical structures for essays have been visualized as diagrams, making them easy to implement or adapt in the construction of an argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mariopetrucci.com/MissionPossible-StudySkills.htm |title='Mission Possible' by Dr. Mario Petrucci |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-10-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026012057/http://www.mariopetrucci.com/MissionPossible-StudySkills.htm |archivedate=2014-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic==
[[File:Czythumbur.jpg|thumb|[[University student]]s, like these students doing research at a university library, are often assigned essays as a way to get them to analyze what they have read.]] 
{{main article|Free response}}
In countries like the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]], essays have become a major part of a formal [[education]] in the form of [[free response]] questions. Secondary students in these countries are taught structured essay formats to improve their writing skills, and essays are often used by universities in these countries in selecting applicants (''see'' [[admissions essay]]). In both secondary and tertiary education, essays are used to judge the mastery and comprehension of the material. Students are asked to explain, comment on, or assess a topic of study in the form of an essay. In some courses, university students must complete one or more essays over several weeks or months. In addition, in fields such as the humanities and social sciences,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} mid-term and end of term examinations often require students to write a short essay in two or three hours.

In these countries, so-called academic essays also called ''papers'', are usually more formal than literary ones.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} They may still allow the presentation of the writer's own views, but this is done in a logical and factual manner, with the use of the [[first-person narrative|first person]] often discouraged. Longer academic essays (often with a word limit of between 2,000 and 5,000 words){{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} are often more discursive.  They sometimes begin with a short summary analysis of what has previously been written on a topic, which is often called a [[literature review]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Longer essays may also contain an introductory page that defines words and phrases of the essay's topic. Most academic institutions require that all substantial facts, quotations, and other supporting material in an essay be referenced in a [[bibliography]] or works cited page at the end of the text. This scholarly convention helps others (whether teachers or fellow scholars) to understand the basis of facts and quotations the author uses to support the essay's argument and helps readers evaluate to what extent the argument is supported by evidence, and to evaluate the quality of that evidence. The academic essay tests the student's ability to present their thoughts in an organized way and is designed to test their intellectual capabilities.

One of the challenges facing universities is that in some cases, students may submit essays purchased from an [[essay mill]] (or "paper mill") as their own work. An "essay mill" is a [[ghostwriting]] service that sells pre-written essays to university and college students. Since [[plagiarism]] is a form of [[academic dishonesty]] or [[academic fraud]], universities and colleges may investigate papers they suspect are from an essay mill by using [[plagiarism detection]] software, which compares essays against a database of known mill essays and by orally testing students on the contents of their papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Khomami |first=Nadia |title=Plan to crack down on websites selling essays to students announced |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/feb/21/plan-to-crack-down-on-websites-selling-essays-to-students-announced |newspaper=The Guardian |date=20 February 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427193720/https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/feb/21/plan-to-crack-down-on-websites-selling-essays-to-students-announced |archivedate=27 April 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magazine or newspaper==
{{main|Long-form journalism}}
Essays often appear in magazines, especially magazines with an intellectual bent, such as ''[[The Atlantic]]'' and ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harpers]]''. Magazine and newspaper essays use many of the essay types described in the section on forms and styles (e.g., descriptive essays, narrative essays, etc.). Some newspapers also print essays in the [[op-ed]] section.
[[File:Harper's_February_(1895).jpeg|thumb|An 1895 cover of ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harpers]]'', a US magazine that prints a number of essays per issue.]]

==Employment==
Employment essays detailing experience in a certain occupational field are required when applying for some jobs, especially government jobs in the United States. Essays known as Knowledge Skills and Executive Core Qualifications are required when applying to certain US federal government positions.

A KSA, or "Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities," is a series of narrative statements that are required when applying to Federal government job openings in the United States. KSAs are used along with resumes to determine who the best applicants are when several candidates qualify for a job. The knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary for the successful performance of a position are contained on each job vacancy announcement. KSAs are brief and focused essays about one's career and educational background that presumably qualify one to perform the duties of the position being applied for.

An Executive Core Qualification, or ECQ, is a narrative statement that is required when applying to Senior Executive Service positions within the US Federal government. Like the KSAs, ECQs are used along with resumes to determine who the best applicants are when several candidates qualify for a job. The Office of Personnel Management has established five executive core qualifications that all applicants seeking to enter the Senior Executive Service must demonstrate.

==Non-literary types==

===Film===
A film essay (or "cinematic essay") consists of the evolution of a theme or an idea rather than a plot per se, or the film literally being a cinematic accompaniment to a narrator reading an essay.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} From another perspective, an essay film could be defined as a [[documentary film]] visual basis combined with a form of commentary that contains elements of self-portrait (rather than autobiography), where the signature (rather than the life story) of the filmmaker is apparent. The cinematic essay often blends [[Documentary film|documentary]], [[fiction]], and [[Experimental film|experimental film making]] using tones and editing styles.&lt;ref name="chicagomediaworks1"&gt;[http://www.chicagomediaworks.com/2instructworks/3editing_doc/3editing_docinematicessay.html Cinematic Essay Film Genre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808123129/http://www.chicagomediaworks.com/2instructworks/3editing_doc/3editing_docinematicessay.html |date=2007-08-08 }}. chicagomediaworks.com.

The genre is not well-defined but might include propaganda works of early [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] parliamentarians like [[Dziga Vertov]], present-day filmmakers including [[Chris Marker]],&lt;ref&gt;{{registration required|date=August 2012}} Lim, Dennis (July 31, 2012).

David Winks Gray's article "The essay film in action" states that the "essay film became an identifiable form of filmmaking in the 1950s and '60s". He states that since that time, essay films have tended to be "on the margins" of the filmmaking the world. Essay films have a "peculiar searching, questioning tone ... between documentary and fiction" but without "fitting comfortably" into either genre. Gray notes that just like written essays, essay films "tend to marry the personal voice of a guiding narrator (often the director) with a wide swath of other voices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gray|first1=David Winks|title=The essay film in action|url=http://www.sf360.org/features/the-essay-film-in-action|publisher=[[San Francisco Film Society]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315200322/http://www.sf360.org/features/the-essay-film-in-action|archivedate=March 15, 2009|date=January 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Wisconsin]] Cinematheque website echoes some of Gray's comments; it calls a film essay an "intimate and allusive" genre that "catches filmmakers in a pensive mood, ruminating on the margins between fiction and documentary" in a manner that is "refreshingly inventive, playful, and idiosyncratic".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110720113611/http://cinema.wisc.edu/series/2009_spring/essay.htm "Talking Pictures: The Art of the Essay Film"]. Cinema.wisc.edu. Retrieved March 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
In the realm of [[music]], composer [[Samuel Barber]] wrote a set of "Essays for Orchestra," relying on the form and content of the music to guide the listener's ear, rather than any [[program music|extra-musical plot or story]].

===Photography===
[[File:Huahine, French Polynesia, Image - Scott Williams.jpg|thumb|"After School Play Interrupted by the Catch and Release of a Stingray" is a simple time-sequence [[photo essay]].]]

A [[photo essay|photographic essay]] strives to cover a topic with a linked series of [[photograph]]s. Photo essays range from purely photographic works to photographs with captions or small notes to full-text essays with a few or many accompanying photographs. Photo essays can be sequential in nature, intended to be viewed in a particular order — or they may consist of non-ordered photographs viewed all at once or in an order that the viewer chooses. All photo essays are collections of photographs, but not all collections of photographs are photo essays. Photo essays often address a certain issue or attempt to capture the character of places and events.

===Visual arts===
In the visual [[art]]s, an essay is a preliminary drawing or sketch that forms a basis for a final painting or sculpture, made as a test of the work's composition (this meaning of the term, like several of those following, comes from the word ''essay'''s meaning of "attempt" or "trial").

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10363">The [[Japanese language]] has some words and some grammatical constructions that are associated with men or boys, while others are associated with women or girls. Such differences are sometimes called "gendered language".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Okamoto|first1=Shigeko|last2=Shibamoto Smith|first2=Janet S. |title=Japanese Language, Gender, and Ideology: Cultural Models and Real People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ans8DwAAQBAJ|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-516617-0|page=10|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japanese, speech patterns associated with women are referred to as {{nihongo||女言葉|onna kotoba|"women's words"}} or {{nihongo||女性語|joseigo|"women's language"}}.

In general, the words and speech patterns associated with men are perceived as rough, vulgar, or abrupt, while those associated with women are considered more polite, more deferential, or "softer". Some linguists consider the description of "rough–soft continuum" more accurate than the description of "male–female continuum". For example, [[Eleanor Harz Jorden]] in ''[[Japanese: The Spoken Language]]'' refers to the styles as "blunt/gentle", rather than male/female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Jorden |first1=Eleanor Harz |last2=Noda |first2=Mari |year=1987 |title=Japanese: The Spoken Language |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-03834-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no gender differences in written Japanese (except in quoted speech), and almost no differences in polite speech (''[[teineigo]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=David |first=Oana |year=2009 |title=Teineigo and style-mixing: Formality variation in the interview register and application of conversation analysis theory |type=Master of Sciences |publisher=University of Oxford|url=http://www.linguistics.berkeley.edu/~oana/teineigo.pdf |access-date=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional women's speech==

The word {{nihongo||女らしい|onnarashii}}, which is usually translated as "ladylike" or "feminine," refers to the behaviour expected of a typical Japanese woman.  As well as behaving in particular ways, being ''onnarashii'' means conforming to particular styles of speech.  Some of the features of women’s speech include speaking in a higher [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]], using more polite forms and using polite speech or honorifics in more situations, and referring to themselves and those whom they address more formally.&lt;ref name="Siegal"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Siegal|first1=Meryl|last2=Okamoto|first2=Shigeko|year=2003|title=Toward reconceptualizing the teaching and learning of gendered speech styles in Japanese as a Foreign Language|journal=Japanese Language and Literature|volume=37|issue=1|pages=49–66|jstor=3594875}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kazuko|first=Ashizawa|year=1998|title=Mangajin's Basic Japanese Through Comics|publisher=Weatherhill|isbn=0-8348-0452-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some linguistic features commonly associated with women include omission of the [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] ''da'', the use of [[Japanese pronouns|personal pronouns]] such as ''watashi'' or ''atashi'' among others, use of feminine sentence-final particles such as ''wa'', ''na no'', ''kashira'', and ''mashō'', and the more frequent use of the [[Honorific speech in Japanese|honorific]] prefixes ''o'' and ''go''.&lt;ref name="Siegal" /&gt;

Actual language used by Japanese-speaking women differs from these ideals. Such ''onnarashii'' speech is a [[social norm]] that institutions such as [[Educational institution|education]] and [[Media (communication)|media]] encourage women to adopt. Similarly, these forms may be prescribed for women learners by Japanese textbooks and other materials. There are, however, various deviations from these norms in conversation.&lt;ref name="Siegal"/&gt;

Although Japanese women may not follow the gender norm in speech, some linguistic studies indicate that Japanese women tend to use more honorific language than men do, which reinforces the idea of ''onnarashii'' and traditional [[gender role]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tanaka|first=Lidia|title=Gender, Language and Culture: A Study of Japanese Television Interview Discourse|year=2004|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=978-90-272-3079-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional men's speech==

Just as there are modes of speaking and behaviour that are considered intrinsically feminine, there are also those that are considered {{nihongo||男らしい|otokorashii|"manly" or "masculine"}}. Based on men's reports of their own speech, as well as [[prescriptive]] advice for language use, men's language is thought of as using fewer polite forms, distinct pronouns and sentence-final particles, and some [[Vowel reduction|reduced vowels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sturtz Sreetharan|first=Cindi|editor=Shigeko Okamoto and Janet Shibamoto Smith|title=Japanese Language, Gender, and Ideology|year=2004|publisher=Oxford|isbn=0-19-516617-5|chapter=Japanese men's linguistic stereotypes and realities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some words associated with men's speech include the informal ''da'' in place of the copula ''desu'', personal pronouns such as ''ore'' and ''boku'', and sentence-final particles such as ''yo'', ''ze'', ''zo'', and ''kana''.&lt;ref name="Siegal" /&gt; Masculine speech also features less frequent use of honorific prefixes and fewer ''[[aizuchi]]'' response tokens.&lt;ref name="Sreetharan"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sturtz Sreetharan|first1=Cindi|title=Students, sarariiman (pl.), and seniors: Japanese men's use of ′manly′ speech register|journal=Language in Society|volume=33|issue=01|year=2004|issn=0047-4045|doi=10.1017/S0047404504031045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on Japanese men's speech shows greater use of "neutral" forms, forms not strongly associated with masculine or feminine speech, than is seen in Japanese women's speech.&lt;ref name="Sreetharan" /&gt;

Some studies of conversation between Japanese men and women show neither gender taking a more dominant position in interaction. Men, however, tend to show a "self-oriented conversation style", telling stories and expressing their expertise on topics being discussed more than is typical of women in these studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Itakura|first1=Hiroko|last2=Tsui|first2=Amy B. M.|title=Gender and conversational dominance in Japanese conversation|journal=Language in Society|volume=33|issue=02|year=2004|issn=0047-4045|doi=10.1017/S0047404504332033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In modern society==
Since the late twentieth century observers have noted that individual Japanese men and women do not necessarily speak in the ways attributed to their gender. Scholars have described considerable variation within each gender; some individuals use traditional characteristics of gendered speech, while others do not.&lt;ref name="Siegal"/&gt; Upper-class women who do not conform to traditional expectations of gendered speech are sometimes criticized for failing to maintain "traditional Japanese culture".&lt;ref name="Siegal"/&gt;

Regional dialect may often play a role in the expression and perception masculinity or femininity of speech in Japanese.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Another recent phenomenon influencing gender norms in speech is the popularity of {{Nihongo||おかま|okama}} entertainers, typically men who enact very feminine speech, dress, and other gender markers. The word ''okama'' originally referred to male [[Homosexuality|homosexuals]], but its usage has expanded to refer to gay men and [[Transvestism|cross-dressers]] as well as [[trans woman|trans women]], among other uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wim Lunsing|editor=Mark McLelland and Romit Dasgupta|title=Genders, Transgenders and Sexualities in Japan|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-26058-4|chapter=The politics of okama and onabe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entertainers who identify as okama sometimes use a form of speech called {{Nihongo||お姉言葉|onē kotoba}}, literally "older sister speech", a speaking style that combines the formal aspects of women's speech described above with blunt or crude words and topics.&lt;ref name="shifting"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wim Lunsing|author2=Claire Maree|editor=Shigeko Okamoto and Janet Shibamoto Smith|title=Japanese Language, Gender, and Ideology|year=2004|publisher=Oxford|isbn=0-19-516617-5|chapter=Shifting speakers: Negotiating reference in relation to sexuality and gender}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example:
*あたし 今 カレー 食ったら 下痢 だ わ。
:''Atashi ima karē kuttara geri da wa.''
:"If I ate curry now, I'd get diarrhea."
The pronoun ''atashi'' and the sentence-final ''da wa'' is typical of women's speech, while the verb [[wikt:食う|''kuttara'']] is typical of men's speech and the topic itself is very blunt.&lt;ref name="shifting"/&gt;

[[File:ConnectorSymbols.svg|thumb|Schematic symbols for male and female connector pins]]
In [[electrical]] and [[machine|mechanical]] trades and manufacturing, each half of a pair of mating [[Electrical connector|connectors]] or [[fastener]]s is conventionally assigned the designation '''male''' or '''female'''. The "female" connector is generally a [[AC power plugs and sockets|receptacle]] that receives and holds the "male" connector. On occasion, the terms "male" and "female" are respectively referred to as the '''A''' and '''B''' ends{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}, though the names of some standards conflict with this as they contain the letters A or B within the name; unambiguous, though rare, terms include '''plug''' and '''socket''' or '''jack'''.

The assignment is a direct [[analogy]] with [[genitalia]] and [[heterosexual]] [[Sexual intercourse|sex]]; the part bearing one or more [[Protrusion|protrusions]], or which fits inside the other, being designated [[male]] in contrast to the part containing the corresponding indentations, or fitting outside the other, being designated [[female]]. Extension of the analogy results in the verb '''to [[mating|mate]]''' being used to describe the process of connecting two corresponding parts together. 

In some cases (notably electrical power connectors), the gender of connectors is selected according to rigid rules, to enforce a sense of one-way directionality (e.g. a flow of power ''from'' one device ''to'' another). This gender distinction is implemented to enhance safety or ensure proper functionality by preventing unsafe or non-functional configurations from being set up.

In terms of mathematical [[graph theory]], an electrical power distribution network made up of plugs and sockets is a [[directed tree]], with the directionality arrows corresponding to the female-to-male transfer of electrical power through each mated connection. This is an example where male and female connectors have been deliberately designed and assigned to physically enforce a safe network topology.

In other contexts, such as plumbing, one-way flow is ''not'' enforced through connector gender assignment. Flows through piping networks can be bidirectional, as in underground water distribution networks which have designed-in [[redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]]. In plumbing situations where one-way flow ''is'' desired, it is implemented through other means (e.g. gravity flow, one-way check valves), and not through male-female gender schemes.

==Mechanical fasteners==
[[Image:Bolt-with-nut.jpg|thumb|''Female'' nut threaded onto a ''male'' bolt]]
In mechanical design, the prototypical "male" component is a threaded bolt, but an alignment post, a [[mounting boss]], or a sheet metal tab connector can also be considered as male. Correspondingly, a threaded nut, an alignment hole, a mounting recess, or sheet metal slot connector is considered to be female.

While some mechanical designs are "one-off" custom setups not intended to be repeated, there is an entire [[fastener]] industry devoted to manufacturing mass-produced or semi-custom components. To avoid unnecessary confusion, conventional definitions of fastener gender have been defined and agreed upon.

==Modular construction toys==
[[Image:LEGO-01.jpg|thumb|Lego toy brick connections are ''male'' on top, and ''female'' underneath]]
Although this aspect is not highlighted in their promotional literature, several common construction toys&lt;ref name=Toys&gt;[[:Category:Construction toys]]&lt;/ref&gt; embody gendered (and in some cases, genderless) mechanical interconnections. This should not be surprising, since these toys feature the nearly infinite flexibility and versatility of shape that a modular interconnect architecture can enable. Mathematicians have begun to classify well-known [[construction set]]s using [[group theory]] to study the combinatoric possibilities of structures that can be built.

For example, the canonical [[LEGO]] plastic blocks have "female" indentations on the lower surface, and "male" bosses or protrusions on the upper surfaces. [[Meccano]] and [[Erector]] have many gendered connections, starting with the nut-and-bolt fasteners they use frequently.

[[Stickle bricks]], using interlocking plastic protrusions, are effectively genderless. [[Lincoln logs]] use a very simple form of genderless connections. [[Kapla]] or [[KEVA planks]] are extremely simple genderless systems interconnected only by gravity.

==Plumbing==
{{main article|Threaded pipe}}
[[Image:Malefemalepipe.jpg|thumb|right|Left: A ''male'' threaded pipe,&lt;br&gt;Right: a ''female'' threaded [[Piping and plumbing fittings|elbow]]]]

In plumbing fittings, the "M" or "F" usually comes at the beginning rather than the end of the abbreviated designation. For example:
* MIPT denotes Male Iron Pipe Thread;
* FIPT denotes Female Iron Pipe Thread.

A short length of pipe having an MIP thread at both ends is sometimes called a [[Piping and plumbing fittings#Nipple|nipple]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plumbingsupply.com/chrome.html Chrome Fittings &amp; Nipples]&lt;/ref&gt; A short pipe fitting having an FIP thread at both ends is sometimes called a [[Piping and plumbing fittings#Coupling|coupling]].

[[Hermaphroditic]] connections, which include both male and female elements in a single unit, are used for some specialized tubing fittings, such as [[Storz]] [[fire hose]] connectors. A picture of such fittings appears in the 
[[#Genderless (hermaphroditic)]] connectors section of this article.

==Downspout==
[[Downspout]]s ('''downpipes''', '''rain conductors''' or '''leaders''') are used to convey rainwater from [[roof gutters]] to the ground through hollow pipes or tubes.  These tubes usually come in sections, joined by inserting the male end (often [[crimp connection|crimped]] with a special tool to slightly reduce its size) into the female end of the next section.  These connections are usually not sealed or caulked, instead relying on gravity to move the rainwater from the male end and into the receiving female connection located directly below.

==Ductwork==
[[Sheet metal]] [[ductwork]] for conveying air in [[HVAC]] systems typically uses gendered connections.  Typically,  the airflow through a ductwork connection is from male to female.  However, since one-way flow is implemented by forced-air fans or blowers,  "backwards" gendered connections can be seen frequently in some systems, since all connections are typically sealed with duct sealing [[Adhesive|mastic]] or tape to prevent leakage anyway.  The flow convention is usually loosely adhered to for simplicity of design, and to reduce the number of gender changer fittings required, but exceptions are made whenever expedient.

==Electrical and electronic==

Although the gender of tubing and plumbing fittings is usually obvious, this may not be true of [[electrical connectors]] because of their more complex and varying constructions. Instead, connector gender is conventionalized and thus can be somewhat obscure to the uninitiated. For example, the female [[D-subminiature]] connector body projects outward from the mounting plane of the chassis, and this protrusion could be erroneously construed as male. Instead, the "maleness" of the D-subminiature connectors is defined by specific presence of ''male pins'', rather than by the protrusion of the connector, which is also true for many other pin-based connectors like [[XLR connector|XLR]]. The male/female distinction is more obvious with ring crimp lug connectors which are placed around a screw post, but again with spade or split ring crimp lug connectors the end alone is not obviously female.

Further confusion can be caused by the term "[[jack (connector)|jack]]", which is used for both female and male connectors and typically refers to the fixed (panel) side of a connector pair. IEEE STD 100, IEEE-315-1975 and [[IEEE 200-1975]] (replaced by [[ASME Y14.44-2008]]) define "[[plug (connector)|Plug]]" and "[[jack (connector)|Jack]]" by location or mobility, rather than gender.&lt;ref name=IEEE3151975&gt;{{cite book|title=Graphic Symbols for Electrical and Electronics Diagrams (including Reference Designation Letters)|year=1975|publisher=IEEE|url=http://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/315-1975.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IEEE2001975&gt;{{cite book | title = Standard Reference Designations for Electrical and Electronics Parts and Equipments: IEEE-200-1975 (Reaffirmed 1988): Section 4.1.5.3 | publisher = IEEE and ANSI, New York, NY | year = 1975 | url = http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=ieee-200-1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ASME-y14-44-2008&gt;{{cite book | title = Reference Designations for Electrical and Electronics Parts and Equipment: ASME Y14.44-2008 : Section 2.1.5.3 (2) | publisher = ASME, Fairfield, NJ | year = 2008 | url = https://www.asme.org/products/codes-standards/y1444-2008-reference-designations-electrical}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A connector in a fixed location is a jack and a moveable connector is a plug.&lt;ref name="IEEE3151975" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ASME-y14-44-2008" /&gt; The distinction is relative, so a portable radio is considered stationary compared to the cable from the headphones; the radio has a jack, and the headphone cable has a plug. Where the relationship is equal, such as when two flexible cables are connected, each is considered a plug.  Jacks use the [[reference designator]] prefix of J and plugs use the [[reference designator]] prefix of P.&lt;ref name="IEEE3151975" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ASME-y14-44-2008" /&gt;  It is possible in the case of box mounted connectors for the connector to be a receptacle with male pin contacts.  In this case the connector is designated a jack (J ref des) regardless of the contact gender because the housing for the contacts is in fact configured as the receptacle even though its mate (the plug) goes around the receptacle. See MIL-STD-38999 and similar cases.

It is common practice to use female connectors for jacks, so the informal gender-based usage often happens to agree with the functional description of the technical standards. However, this is ''not'' always the case; often-seen exceptions include a computer's AC Power Inlet and EIA232 DE9 Serial Port, or the male [[Coaxial power connector|coaxial power]] jacks for connecting external power adapters to portable equipment.

To summarize, it is considered best practice to use "male" and "female" for connector ''gender'', and "plug" and "jack" for connector ''function'' or ''mobility''.

===Variant usages===
In the UK, many [[Commonwealth countries]] and some non-English-speaking countries{{where|date=March 2012}}, the word "jack" may refer to the ''plug'' on the end of a removable cable. These connectors were originally referred to as "jack plugs", or plugs intended to be mated with fixed receptacles, or ''sockets'' (which North Americans would call "jacks"), but the second word was dropped.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}  This variant usage is in direct contradiction to common usage and official standards in North America.

In the United Kingdom, for example, the connector on the end of a headphone lead is known as a "jack", that plugs into a ''socket'' on the main unit. The same generally occurs also in Italy, where the English word "jack" is commonly used to indicate the connector on the end of a headphone lead.

In Romania female connectors are known as "mamă" (mother) and male connectors are "tată" (father).

===Abbreviations and alternate terminology===
The standard letters "M" and "F" are commonly used in part numbers to designate connector gender. For example, in Switchcraft XLR [[microphone]] or [[hydrophone]] connectors, the part numbers are denoted as follows:
* A3F = Audio 3-pin Female connector;
* A3M = Audio 3-pin Male connector.

The terms '''plug''', '''pin''', and '''prong''' are also often used for "male" connectors, and '''receptacle''', '''socket''', and '''slot''' are used for "female" connectors. In many cases these terms are more common than ''male'' and ''female'', especially in documentation intended for the non-specialist. These nearly synonymous terms can cause a fair amount of confusion when the designations are shortened in labels.

For example, a female high-density [[D-subminiature]] connector with a size 1 shell can be named DE15F or DE15S (see accompanying pictures). Both terms mean the same thing but could be construed to be completely different items. Similarly, a male standard-density D-sub with a size 1 shell can be named DE9M or DE9P; a female standard-density D-sub with a size 2 shell can be named DA15F or DA15S; a male high-density D-sub with a size 3 shell can be named DB44M or DB44P; and so forth.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Gender selection in electronic design===
Electronic designers often select female jack connectors for fixed mounting on electronic equipment they design. This is usually done because female connectors are more resistant to damage or contamination, by virtue of their concealed or recessed electrical contacts. A damaged motherboard connector can result in the scrapping of an expensive piece of electronic equipment. The risk of expensive damage is reduced by relegating the more exposed male contacts to connecting cables, which can be repaired or replaced at lower cost.

With an RS232 [[serial port]], the male connector is more fragile than the female connector.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Such cost and reliability considerations probably drove the design decision to use female jack connectors on many computer terminals (and some personal computers) for the [[serial port]], in direct violation of the connector gender convention specified in the [[RS-232]] standard for "DTE" computer equipment. This confusing reversal of the RS-232 connector gender convention would cause many hours of frustration for ill-informed end users, as they tried to troubleshoot non-functional serial port equipment connections.

In the case of electrical power connections, designers do not reverse connector gender in such a casual fashion, because exposing live AC line power on male connectors is unsafe and generally illegal. Devices that need to be robust against mechanical damage use a special male [[IEC 60320 C14]] connector (see Gallery above), which is recessed below the surface of a mounting panel, providing the desired physical protection while conforming to safety regulations.

===Safety===
[[File:NEMA 5-15 Outlet 120V-15A.jpg|thumb|upright|Electrical power outlets are ''female'' for safety.]]

In electrical connections where [[voltage]] or [[Electric current|current]] is sufficient to cause [[Electric shock|injury]], the part permanently connected to the power ''source'' is invariably female, with concealed contacts, to prevent inadvertent touching of live conductors. A male plug, with fully exposed protruding contacts, is installed on the cord of (or directly onto) the device ''receiving'' the power.

In the case of consumer-level AC power, connector gender is used to implicitly enforce safe use of power connectors. Because of this consideration, it is illegal under [[electrical code]] to make or use any ''gender changers'' to connect AC line power to consumer-level equipment.

In [[Extra-low voltage|low-voltage]] use such as for [[telecommunication|data communications]], electrical shock hazard is not an issue, and male or female connectors are used based on other engineering factors such as convenience of use, cost, or ease of manufacturing. For example, the common [[Category 5 cable|"patch cables"]] used for [[Ethernet]] (and the similar cords used for [[telephone]]s) typically have male [[modular plug]]s on both ends, to connect to jacks on equipment or mounted in walls.

[[File:Hohlstecker und Hohlbuchse 5,5x2,5.jpg|thumb|left|Common 5.5×2.5&amp;nbsp;mm [[coaxial power connector]]s. Power is provided by the ''female'' ''plug'' on the right to the ''male'' ''jack'' on the left; the exposed conductors are not hazardous due to the low voltage. See text for further explanation. &lt;!--It's also usually isolated, but that's a lot of explanation...--&gt;]]

As an illustrative example of some design tradeoffs in power connector selection, consider the adjacent picture. A commonly seen [[coaxial power connector]] is usually set up so that power is fed ''from'' the female plug on the right ''into'' the male jack on the left (which is typically a part of the electronic device accepting the power). Although the plug is female, with a partially recessed center contact, it is still possible for casual accidental contact with a metallic object to [[Short circuit|short-circuit]] the power source. Depending on the design of the power adapter, it may react to a short circuit by shutting down temporarily, or instead by blowing out an internal safety [[Fuse (electrical)|fuse]].

In this example, the marginal reliability of the connector choice was deemed to be acceptable by the equipment designer, since the power adapter supplies [[Extra-low voltage|low voltage]] that does not pose an electric shock hazard. The potential fire hazard from accidental short-circuiting is addressed by the internal safety fuse, although this requires that a failed power adapter must be completely replaced. In a different design, if the power adapter were intended to supply a voltage sufficient to cause electrical shock, the semi-exposed center contact of the female plug would be considered unacceptably hazardous, requiring a different choice of power connector.

===Ambiguous gender===
Some electrical connectors are [[hermaphroditic]] because they include both male and female elements in a single unit intended to interconnect freely, without regard for gender. See the discussion of [[#Genderless (hermaphroditic)|Genderless connectors]] elsewhere in this article for more detailed information.

As an additional complication, certain electronic connector designs may incorporate combinations of male and female pins in a ''single'' connector body, for mating with a complementary connector with opposite gender pins in corresponding positions. In these unusual cases, gender is often defined by the shape of the connector ''body'', rather than the mixed-gender connector ''pins'' and ''sockets''. These types of connectors are not strictly speaking hermaphroditic, since mating connectors are ''not'' freely interchangeable. An informal term that has been used for these connectors is "bisexual", in addition to the more official terminology, '''mixed-gender'''. Thus, for example, one can have a mixed-gender female plug that connects to a mixed-gender male jack (though a reversed gender assignment of connectors would be a more typical design choice in this example).

Male connector pins are often protected by a '''shell''' (also called a '''shroud''', '''surround''', or '''shield'''), which may envelop the entire female connector when mated. [[RF connector]]s often have multiple layers of interlocking shells to properly connect the shields of [[Coaxial cable|coaxial]] and [[triaxial cable]]. In such cases, the gender is assigned based on the ''innermost'' connecting point.  With the exception of reverse polarity BNC or TNC, where the outer shell determines the gender and the innermost connecting points are opposite to a standard connector, for example a female RP-TNC connector has a solid innermost pin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Better Know a Connector: RP-TNC|url=http://blog.showmecables.com/rp-tnc-connector/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another ambiguous situation arises with the connectors used for [[USB]], [[FireWire]] (IEEE-1394), [[HDMI]], and [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] serial data bus connections. Close examination of these connectors reveals that the contact "pins" are not actually pins, but instead are conductive surfaces that slide past each other when they mate. Therefore, the traditional pin and socket nomenclature is not applicable. Instead, most computer hardware people fall back to referring to the wrap-around metal shield on the plug connector ''as if'' it were a connector ''pin''. By this convention, the connectors on serial bus cables are "male plugs", and the corresponding connectors on equipment are "female jacks".  A unique connector configuration where the contacts are hermaphroditic is the ELCO Varicon where the contacts are bifurcated and nest with one another axial at a 90 degree rotation in cross-shaped wells.  In this case the plugs had the contacts oriented transversely and the sockets longitudinally. 

A casual glance at a USB "Type A" plug connector may give the false impression that it is hermaphroditic. However, a physical attempt to mate two USB "Type A" cables with each other reveals the fact that the connectors will not interconnect. Classifying according to mathematical [[graph theory]], USB buses are [[directed tree]]s, whereas FireWire buses have a true [[bus network]] topology. This difference is reflected in the bus connectors used, in that USB cables are asymmetrical (one end Type A, other end Type B) while FireWire cables may have identical connectors at both ends.

==Genderless (hermaphroditic)==
[[Image:Train coupling.jpg|thumb|Paired "knuckle" type hermaphroditic mechanical [[Janney coupler|couplers]] for railcars (viewed from above)]]
[[Image:Arduino Protoboard Shields.jpg|thumb|[[Arduino]] "shield" boards connected via stackable bus connectors]]
By definition, a [[hermaphroditic]] connector includes mating surfaces having simultaneous male and female aspects, involving complementary paired identical parts each containing both protrusions and indentations. These mating surfaces are mounted into identical fittings which can freely mate with any other, without regard for gender (provided that the size and type are already matched). Alternative names include '''hermaphrodite''', [[Androgynous Peripheral Attach System|androgynous]], '''genderless''', '''sexless''', '''combination''' (or '''combo'''), '''two-in-one''', '''two-way''', and other descriptive terms. Several of these latter alternate names are ambiguous in meaning, and should not be used unless carefully defined in context. True hermaphroditic connectors should not be confused with ''mixed gender'' connectors, which are described elsewhere in this article.

Another closely related type is the '''stackable connector''' for electronics, which typically has male pins on one surface, and complementary female sockets on the opposite surface, allowing multiple units to be stacked up like plastic [[milk crate]]s. Examples of this include stackable banana plugs, and interconnect cables specified for the [[IEEE-488]] instrumentation bus. '''Stackable mezzanine bus connectors''' are used on some modular microcomputer accessory boards for systems such as the [[Arduino]] add-on daughterboards called "shields". The older [[PC/104]] embedded PC modules use a similar stackable format for interconnection. Stackable connectors are not classified as hermaphroditic in the strictest sense, but are often described as such in looser usage.

The hermaphroditic design is useful when multiple complex or lengthy components must be arbitrarily connected in various combinations. For example, if hoses have hermaphroditic fittings, they can be connected without having to pull a lengthy hose and reverse it because it has the wrong gender to connect to another hose. Some military fiber optical cables also have hermaphroditic connectors to prevent "wrong gender" connector problems in field deployments.&lt;ref name=Timbercon&gt;{{cite web|last=Timbercon|title=Hermaphroditic Fiber Optic Connectors|url=http://www.timbercon.com/hermaphroditic-connectors/|accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AmphenolFiber&gt;{{cite web |last=Amphenol Fiber Systems International |title=TFOCA-III Fiber Optic Connectors |url=http://www.fibersystems.com/product_detail.aspx?pt=Products&amp;ProductID=60&amp;CategoryID=51 |accessdate=2011-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118185522/http://www.fibersystems.com/product_detail.aspx?pt=Products&amp;ProductID=60&amp;CategoryID=51 |archivedate=2011-11-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar fashion, [[railcar]]s are usually equipped with hermaphroditic [[railway coupling]] mechanisms that allow either end of the vehicle to be connected to a [[train]] consist without having to turn the railcar around first.
For the same reason, several [[spacecraft docking mechanism]]s are designed to be "androgynous",
including the [[Androgynous Peripheral Attach System]], the [[NASA Docking System]], and [[Chinese Docking Mechanism]].

In the absence of genderless connectors, ''[[gender changer]]'' fittings might be used to enable certain connections. The designer of a connection system may use one or both schemes to allow arbitrary connectivity, or even combine both schemes into a single system.

When an enforced sense of unidirectionality or "one-way flow" is required for safety or other reasons (for example, AC electrical power connections), a strict assignment of connector genders is implemented to prevent undesired configurations, and gender changers are banned.

Some commonly seen examples of hermaphroditic connectors include the [[SAE connector]] for 12 V DC power, [[jackhammer]] air hose connectors, and the [[Anderson Powerpole]] series of modular high-current power connectors. The [[IBM]] [[token ring]] connector was another widespread example, but it has become obsolete and is being phased out. The General Radio Corporation ([[GenRad]]) developed a hermaphroditic coaxial radio frequency connector often called the "[[GR connector]]".

Some [[audio multicore cable]]s are fitted with hermaphroditic multipin quick-disconnect connectors for ease of use in the field. One style of this audio signal cable is fitted on both ends with connectors that are each populated half with pins and half with sockets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whirlwindusa.com/massdiff.html Whirlwind Technical Articles. ''Wiring MASS Connectors FAQ'']&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage to the user is that it does not matter which end connects to the [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] and which to the [[audio mixer]], facilitating faster set up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livesoundint.com/archives/2003/april/big/big.php Live Sound International. Archives, April 2003. ''Connect Corner: The ins and outs of multipin connector designs''. Peter Janis, Cabletek.]&lt;/ref&gt; Another style of connector uses hybrid male/female pins with a receiving slot fitted in the center of each two-tine pin, and relies on 90-degree rotation of the pin axes to mate. The connector housings themselves are sexed male and female.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edac.net/product.html?ProductID=61 EDAC.

==Gender changers==
Devices used for mating two connectors of the same gender have a wide variety of terms, including for example: "[[gender changer]]", "gender mender", "gender bender", "gender blender", "sex changer", and "homosexual adapter".&lt;ref&gt;[http://catb.org/jargon/html/G/gender-mender.html Jargon File: gender mender]&lt;/ref&gt; A specific gender changer can be referred to by either the gender of its connectors, or the gender which it is designed to connect to, resulting in a thoroughly ambiguous terminology. Thus a "male gender changer" might have female connectors to mate two male ends, or male connectors to mate two female ends.

Adding to this potential for confusion, some gender changers also combine additional functions such as [[Crossover_cable|cross-over]] pin-outs or even [[Active_cable|embedding micro-controllers]] for performance, or for [[Logic_level#Logic_voltage_levels|logic level]] or protocol adaptations, which would properly make them an [[Adapter_(computing)|adapter]], but this nomenclature is sometimes neglected in marketing materials or common parlance.

==Examples==
* [[Coaxial power connector]], for low voltage DC connections
* A power cord on an [[Home appliance|appliance]] terminates in a (male) plug; it connects to a (female) socket in a wall or on an extension cord.
* [[Coaxial cable]]s used for video or other high-[[frequency]] [[Signal (information theory)|signals]] are normally terminated, at both ends, in a [[RF connector|connector]] comprising an inner pin and an outer fixed or rotating shell; these are conventionally reckoned as male.
* A threaded [[Nut (hardware)|nut]] is female and a [[screw|bolt]] is male.
* Connectors for [[Air brake (road vehicle)|air brake]] [[Air hose|hoses]] on heavy [[Semi-trailer truck|trucks]] and [[Rolling stock|railroad equipment]] use genderless "[[gladhand connector]]s". In [[Railway air brake|railroad air brake]] use, this makes the orientation of rolling stock irrelevant, and is used with the standard North American [[Janney coupler|railroad coupler]] that connects cars together, also genderless.
* The [[Talmud]] describes arrow heads and mating shafts as potentially being either male or female, depending on their construction, i.e. a prong on a male arrow head fits into a hollowed out shaft and vice versa. This is owing to a prohibition on a female shaft, from its susceptibility as a receptacle for impurity, for use as [[s'chach]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Goldwurm| first = R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18244">[[Gesture]]s are a form of [[Nonverbal communication|non-verbal communication]] that include movements of the hands, arms, and/or other parts of the body. Children can use gesture to communicate before they have the ability to use spoken words and phrases. In this way gestures can prepare children to learn a spoken language, creating a bridge from pre-verbal communication to speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Words and Gestures: Infants' Interpretations of Different Forms of Symbolic Reference|journal = Child Development|date = 1998-04-01|issn = 1467-8624|pages = 295–308|volume = 69|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.1998.tb06189.x|pmid = 9586206|language = en|first = Laura L.|last = Namy|first2 = Sandra R.|last2 = Waxman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The onset of gesture has also been shown to predict and facilitate children's spoken [[language acquisition]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodwyn|first=Susan W.|last2=Acredolo|first2=Linda P.|last3=Brown|first3=Catherine A.|date=2000-06-01|title=Impact of Symbolic Gesturing on Early Language Development|journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior|language=en|volume=24|issue=2|pages=81–103|doi=10.1023/A:1006653828895|issn=0191-5886}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gesture is at the cutting edge of early language development|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027705000223|journal = Cognition|date = 2005-07-01|pages = B101–B113|volume = 96|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.cognition.2005.01.001|first = Şeyda|last = Özçalışkan|first2 = Susan|last2 = Goldin-Meadow|pmid=15996556}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once children begin to use spoken words their gestures can be used in conjunction with these words to form phrases and eventually to express thoughts and complement vocalized ideas.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Gestures not only complement language development but also enhance the child’s ability to communicate. Gestures allow the child  to convey a message or thought that they would not be able to easily express using their limited vocabulary. Children's gestures are classified into different categories occurring in different stages of development. The categories of children's gesture include deictic and representational gestures.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hand and Mind: What Gestures Reveal About Thought|last = McNeill|first = David|publisher = The University of Chicago Press.|year = 1992|isbn = |location = Chicago|pages = 295–328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Difference between signs and gestures ==
Gestures are distinct from manual signs in that they do not belong to a complete language system.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  For example, pointing through the extension of a body part, especially the index finger to indicate interest in an object is a widely used gesture that is understood by many cultures&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Learning to talk in a gesture-rich world: Early communication in Italian vs. American children|url = http://fla.sagepub.com/content/28/2/164|journal = First Language|date = 2008-05-01|issn = 0142-7237|pmc = 2744975|pmid = 19763226|pages = 164–181|volume = 28|issue = 2|doi = 10.1177/0142723707087736|language = en|first = Jana M.|last = Iverson|first2 = Olga|last2 = Capirci|first3 = Virginia|last3 = Volterra|first4 = Susan|last4 = Goldin-Meadow}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, manual signs are conventionalized—they are gestures that have become a lexical element in a language.  A good example of manual signing is [[American Sign Language]] (ASL)–when individuals communicate via ASL, their signs have meanings that are equivalent to words (e.g., two people communicating using ASL both understand that forming a fist with your right hand and rotating this fist using clockwise motions on the chest carries the lexical meaning of the word "sorry").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-signs/s/sorry.htm|title="sorry" American Sign Language (ASL)|website=www.lifeprint.com|access-date=2016-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deictic gestures ==
Typically, the first gestures children show around 10 to 12 months of age are deictic gestures. These gestures are also known as [[pointing]] where children extend their index finger, although any other body part could also be used, to single out an object of interest.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Deictic gestures occur across cultures and indicate that infants are aware of what other people pay attention to. Pre-verbal children use pointing for many different reasons, such as responding to or answering questions and/or sharing their interests and knowledge with others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gesture and Multimodal Development|last = Vallotton|first = Claire|publisher = John Benjamins Publishing Co.|year = 2012|isbn = 9789027273925|location = Amsterdam|pages = 27–48|editor-last2 = Guidetti|editor-last = Colletta|editor-first = Jean-Marc|chapter = Support or competition? Dynamic development of the relationship between manual pointing and symbolic gestures from 6 to 18 months of age|editor-first2 = Michele}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three main functions to infant's pointing:
# '''Imperative''' – this type of deictic gesture develops first and children use it to obtain something (the speech equivalent would be saying "give me that").
# '''Declarative''' – this type of deictic gesture develops later than imperative gestures and directs an adult's attention to an object or event to indicate its existence (the speech equivalent would be saying "look at that"). Declarative pointing is expressive and can be used by the child to draw attention to an interesting object and share this interest with another person. Declarative pointing can also be informative where the child is providing the other person with information. This type of gesture is typically absent in autistic children's gesture repertoires.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gesture and Multimodal Development|last = Cochet|first = Helene|publisher = John Benjamins Publishing Co.|year = 2012|isbn = 9789027273925|location = Amsterdam|pages = 7–26|editor-first = Jean-Marc|editor-last = Colletta|chapter = Pointing gesture in young children: Hand preference and language development|editor-last2 = Guidetti|editor-first2 = Michele|last2 = Vauclair|first2 = Jacques}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Epistemic''' – this type of deictic gesture also develops after imperative gestures and may develop at the same time as declarative gestures. These type of gestures serve as an [[Epistemology|epistemic]] request wherein infants may point to an object in order for an adult to provide new information, like a name, to an object (the speech equivalent would be saying "what is that").&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Pointing as Epistemic Request: 12-month-olds Point to Receive New Information|journal = Infancy|date = 2014-11-01|issn = 1532-7078|pmc = 4641318|pmid = 26568703|pages = 543–557|volume = 19|issue = 6|doi = 10.1111/infa.12060|language = en|first = Ágnes Melinda|last = Kovács|first2 = Tibor|last2 = Tauzin|first3 = Ernő|last3 = Téglás|first4 = György|last4 = Gergely|first5 = Gergely|last5 = Csibra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of deictic gestures that are declarative and [[Epistemology|epistemic]] in nature reflects another important part of children's development, the development of [[joint attention|joint visual attention]]. Joint visual attention occurs when a child and an adult are both paying attention to the same object.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Development of Sensory, Motor, and Cognitive Capacities in Early Infancy|last = Butterworth|first = George|publisher = Psychology Press Ltd.|year = 1998|isbn = 978-0-86377-512-3|location = United Kingdom|pages = 171–190|editor-last = Simion|editor-first = Francesca|editor-last2 = Butterworth|editor-first2 = George|chapter = What is special about pointing in babies?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joint attention through the use of pointing is considered a precursor to speech development because it reveals that children want to communicate with another person.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Furthermore, the amount of pointing at 12 months old predicts speech production and comprehension rates at 24 months old.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Once children can produce spoken words they often use deictic gestures to create sentence-like phrases. These phrases occur when a child, for example, says the word "eat" and then points to a cookie. The incidence of these gesture-word combinations predicts the transition from one-word to two-word speech.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This shows that gesture can maximize the communicative opportunities that children can have before their speech is fully developed facilitating their entrance into lexical and syntactic development.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morgenster, Aliyah; Caet, Stephanie; Collumbel-Leroy, Marie; Limousin, Fanny; Blondel, Marion.

Amsterdam: John Benjamins Publishing Co. pp. 49–78. {{ISBN|9789027273925}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Representational gestures ==
Representational gesture refers to an object, person, location, or event with hand movement, body movement, or [[facial expression]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = From communication to language in two modalities|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0885201494900183|journal = Cognitive Development|date = 1994-01-01|pages = 23–43|volume = 9|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/0885-2014(94)90018-3|first = Jana M.|last = Iverson|first2 = Olga|last2 = Capirci|first3 = M. Cristina|last3 = Caselli}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representational gestures can be divided into iconic and conventional gestures. Unlike deictic gestures, representational gestures communicate a specific meaning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gesturing in mother-child interactions|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885201499800185|journal = Cognitive Development|date = 1999-01-01|pages = 57–75|volume = 14|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/S0885-2014(99)80018-5|first = Jana M.|last = Iverson|first2 = Olga|last2 = Capirci|first3 = Emiddia|last3 = Longobardi|first4 = M.|last4 = Cristina Caselli}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Children start to produce representational gestures at 10 to 24 months of age.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Young children create iconic gestures to inform others.|journal = Developmental Psychology|pages = 2049–2060|volume = 50|issue = 8|doi = 10.1037/a0037224|first = Tanya|last = Behne|first2 = Malinda|last2 = Carpenter|first3 = Michael|last3 = Tomasello|pmid=24979473|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young American children will produce more deictic gestures than representational gestures,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but Italian children will produce almost equal amounts of representational and deictic gestures.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Iconic gestures ===

Iconic gestures have visually similar relationship to the action, object, or attribute they portray.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; There is an increase in iconic gesturing after the two-word utterance stage at 26 months.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Children are able to create novel iconic gestures when they were attempting to inform the listener of information they think the listener does not know. Iconic gestures aided language development after the two-word utterance stage, whereas deictic gestures did not.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gestures in Language Development|last = Gullberg|first = Marianne|publisher = John Benjamins Pub. Co.|year = 2010|isbn = |location = Philadelphia|pages = 3–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iconic gestures are the most common form of representational gesture in Italian children.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Children will copy the iconic gestures they see their parents using,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; therefore including iconic gestures when measuring representational vocabularies increases Italian children's vocabularies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Even though the Italian children produced more iconic gestures, the two-word utterance stage did not arrive earlier than American children who produce fewer iconic gestures.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Conventional gestures ===

Conventional gestures are culture-bound emblems that do not translate across different cultures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Culture]]-specific gestures such as shaking your head "no" or waving "goodbye" are considered conventional gestures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although American children do not typically produce many representational gestures in general, conventional gestures are the most frequently used in the representational gesture category.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Timeline of gesture development ==
Like most developmental timelines it is important to consider that no two children develop at the same pace. Infant [[gesture]] is thought to be an important part of the prelinguistic period and prepares a child for the emergence of language.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book

== Augmentative and alternative communication ==
Not only do gestures play an important role in the natural development of spoken language, but they also are a major factor in [[augmentative and alternative communication]] (AAC).  AAC refers to the methods, tools, and theories to use non-standard linguistic forms of communication by and with individuals without or with limited functional speech.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Loncke, F. (2013). Augmentative and Alternative Communication: Models and applications for educators, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, caregivers, and users. San Diego, CA: Plural Publishing Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  Means used to communicate in AAC can span from high-tech computer-based communication devices, to low-tech means such as one-message switches, to non-tech means such as picture cards, manual signs, and gestures.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  It is only within the last two decades that the importance of gestures in the cognitive and linguistic development processes has been examined, and in particular the gesture's functionality for individuals with communication disorders, especially AAC users.

'''Idea networking''' is a qualitative method of doing a [[cluster analysis]] of any collection of statements, developed by Mike Metcalfe at the [[University of South Australia]].&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"&gt;{{cite book |last=Metcalfe |first=Mike |date=2014 |chapter=Idea networking |title=How concepts solve management problems |location=Cheltenham, UK |publisher=[[Edward Elgar Publishing]] |pages=62–74 |isbn=9781783471072 |oclc=868380268 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=EuJnAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Networking lists of statements acts to reduce them into a handful of clusters or categories. The statements might be source from interviews, text, web sites, [[focus group]]s, [[SWOT analysis]] or community consultation. Idea networking is [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] as it does not assume any prior classification system to cluster the statements. Rather keywords or issues in the statements are individually linked (paired). These links can then be entered into network software to be displayed as a network with clusters. When named, these clusters provide emergent categories, meta themes, frames or concepts which represent, structure or sense-make the collection of statements.&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"/&gt;

==Method==
An idea network can be constructed in the following way:&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"/&gt;
* 60 to 200 statements are listed and assigned reference numbers. 
* A table is constructed showing which statements (by reference number) are linked (paired) and why. For example, statement 1 maybe linked to statements 4, 23, 45, 67, 89 and 107 because they all are about the weather (see table). 
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Statement !! Is Linked To !! Because They Are About
|-
| 1 || 4, 23, 45, 67, 89, 107 || Weather
|-
| 2 || 16, 29, 46, 81 || Light
|-
| 3 || 23, 45, 67, 89, 107 || Interaction
|-
| 4 || 13, 16, 34, 78, 81 || Weather
|-
| Etc. || Etc. || Etc.
|}

The number of links per statement should be from 1 to 7; many more will result in a congested network diagram. This means choosing why the statements are linked may need grading as strong or weak, or by sub sets. For example, statements linked as being about weather conditions may be further subdivided into those about good weather, wet weather or bad weather, etc.). This linking is sometimes called 'coding' in thematic analysis which highlights that the statements can be linked for several and different reasons (source, context, time, etc.). There maybe many tens of reasons why statements are linked. The same statements may be linked for different reasons. The number of reasons should not be restricted to low number as so anticipate the resultant clustering. 
*The reference numbers are inputed to a network diagramming software, usually in the form of a matrix with the reference numbers along the top and side of the matrix. Each cell will then have a 1 or 0 to indicate whether its row and column reference number are linked. 
*The software is instructed to draw network diagram using maximum node repulsion. This encourages cluster formation.  Around 5 clusters are identified in the network diagram, both visually and using the cluster identification algorithms supplied with the software (e.g. Newnan Girvan sub-groups) 
[[File:Idea Networking Example.jpg|thumb|Idea Network]]
*A descriptive collective adjective name is determined for each cluster of statements (a meta narrative, classification name or label). 
*The list of statements is then reported as being clustered into these five or so cluster names (themes, frames, concepts). For example, one might report that your analysis of the statements shows that those at community meeting were using the concepts of exposure, interaction, safety, light and inspiration in their responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Metcalfe |first=Mike |date=April 2007 |title=Problem conceptualisation using idea networks |journal=Systemic Practice and Action Research |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=141–150 |doi=10.1007/s11213-006-9056-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Underlying philosophy ==
In his book ''[[Notes on the Synthesis of Form]]'', the pragmatist [[Christopher Alexander]] suggested networking the ideas of clients as means to identifying the major facets of an architectural design.&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"/&gt; This is still used modern design work usually using [[cluster analysis]]. Modern [[social network analysis software]] provides a useful tool for how these ideas can be networked. 
This simply adds ideas to the list of computers, power stations, people and events that can be networked (see [[Network theory]]).&lt;ref name="socialcapitalnetknowtransfer"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Inkpen |first1=Andrew C. |last2=Tsang |first2=Eric W. K. |date=January 2005 |title=Social capital, networks, and knowledge transfer |journal=[[Academy of Management Review]] |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=146–165 |doi=10.5465/AMR.2005.15281445 |jstor=20159100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The links between ideas can be represented in a matrix or network. Modern network diagramming software, with node repulsion algorithms, allows useful visual representation of these networks revealing clusters of nodes.

When networking peoples' statements or ideas, these become the nodes and the links are provided by an analyst linking those statements thought to be similar. Keywords, synonyms, experience or context might be used to provide this linking. For example, the statements: (1) "That war is economics progressed by other means, might be considered linked to the statement"; (2) "That progress unfortunately needs the innovation which is a consequence of human conflict". 
 
Linguistic [[pragmatism]] argues we use our conceptions to interpret our perceptions (sensory inputs).&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"/&gt;{{rp|18}} These conceptions might be represented by words as conceptual ideas or concepts. For example, if we use the conceptual idea or concepts of justice to interpret the actions of people, we get a different interpretation (or meaning) compared to using the conceptual idea of personal power. Using the conceptual idea of justice makes certain action ideas seem reasonable. These may include due process, legal representation, hearing both sides, have norms or regulations for comparison. Therefore, there is a relationship between conceptual ideas and related apparently rational action ideas.

If the statements gathered at a consultative meeting are considered action ideas, then clusters of these similar actions ideas might be considered to examples of a meta idea or conceptual idea. These are also called themes, and frames. Modern research extending Miller's Magic number 7 plus or minus 2, to idea handling, suggests a five-part classification is appropriate for humans.&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"/&gt;{{rp|145}}

==Notable applications and uses==

Using networking to cluster statements is considered useful because:&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"/&gt;

*It provides a multi-dimensional alternative to [[post-it note]]s in clusters.
*It offers a convenient graphic which can be presented in reports and analysed using network metrics (See [[Computer assisted qualitative data analysis software]]). 
*It is an auditable process where each step taken can be explained in supporting documentation.
*It is a qualitative alternative, and thus more subtle and transparent, than [[NVivo]], [[thematic analysis]], [[cluster analysis]], [[factor analysis]], [[multidimensional scaling]] or [[principal component analysis]]. This subtleness includes enabling the analyst to deal with metaphor, synonyms, pronouns and alternative terminology generally. No variables (variation in numerical data) are necessary.

There has been a long-standing '''influence of [[French language|French]] on [[English language|English]],''' in terms of [[syntax]], [[grammar]], [[lexicon]], spelling and pronunciation.

Most French vocabulary that entered English occurred after the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066 and the establishment of a French-speaking administration. French became the language of the court, the administration and the elites for several centuries, until after the [[Hundred Years War]]. English has been constantly influenced by French from that time till present day.
According to Laura K. Lawless, more than a third of the current [[English vocabulary]] is of French origin.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://french.about.com/od/vocabulary/a/frenchinenglish.htm |website=french.about.com |title=Terms of Enrichment: How French Has Influenced English |accessdate=2018-11-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216063051/http://french.about.com/od/vocabulary/a/frenchinenglish.htm# |archive-date=2016-12-16 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to linguist [[Henriette Walter]], words of French origin represent more than two thirds of the English vocabulary. It is estimated by linguist Anthony Lacoudre that over 40 000 English words are directly French and may be understood without [[orthographical]] change by French speakers.&lt;ref name="dailymotion"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5vbb1z |title=L&amp;#039;incroyable histoire des mots français dans la langue anglaise – Vidéo dailymotion |website=dailymotion.com |accessdate=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of French in England ==

=== Before 1066 ===
At the beginning of XIth century, the English language did not have a well-defined status. Indeed, the inhabitants of what would become [[Great Britain]] did not have a language that allowed them to communicate with each other. There were many different [[dialect]]al forms. Great Britain, in which various [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] idioms had coexisted since the IVth century, had experienced partial [[Roman Empire|Roman occupation]] since the 1st century A.D., and this for four centuries.

From 450 onwards, the [[Saxons]], the [[Angles (people)|Angles]] and the [[Jutes]], who came from the continent, settled in the south and east. Germanic dialects would prevail in these regions, supplanting Celtic dialects, which would remain in the west and north of the island ([[Wales]], [[Cornwall]], [[Scotland]]) and [[Ireland]]. In the VIIIth century, [[Vikings]] from [[Scandinavia]] settled on the island. Their languages, also Germanic, in turn influence the languages already present on the island. Thus, at the dawn of XIth century, the country was made up of a series of peoples with significantly different speeches, most of them Germanic, with multiple influences.

=== Norman conquest of England and its consequences ===
It is therefore a linguistically disunited people that the Normans will get massively in contact with, from 1066. [[William II of Normandy]], supported by his King, [[Philip I of France]], and his blood legitimacy to the throne of England, landed at [[Hastings]], in [[Sussex]], on 29 September 1066. His men are deployed around the city waiting for the king [[Harold II]]'s troops. On October 14, exhausted by the long journey to Hastings, Harold II's troops lost the battle after a day. Following the defeat of the English, Duke William II of Normandy became King of England on December 25, 1066, crowned under the name of William I of England, also known as William the Conqueror. This date marks the beginning of a long period of ties between the peoples and languages.

In fact, these links already existed before the Battle of Hastings. Indeed, the geographical location of Normandy, facing the English Channel, favoured commercial contacts with England. These ties will be further strengthened at the beginning of the XIth century when the daughter of the Duke [[Richard II of Normandy]], Emma, marries King [[Æthelred II of England]]. But it is really from the 1066 conquest that [[proto-English]] becomes massively impregnated with [[Old French]], then modern French. It should be noted, however, that only French will influence English in the centuries following the conquest. The reverse contribution of English to French will only be real from the XVIIIth century.

The arrival of William the Conqueror and his barons significantly changed the linguistic situation in England. [[Norman language|Norman]] is essentially imposed in the upper layers of society. The Anglo-Saxon dialects were supplanted by Norman in the circles of the court and aristocracy, justice and the Church. The influential circles, who came from Normandy and settled in England, kept their Norman mother tongue, while the more modest rural and urban strata continued to speak English.

Norman is a particular variety of the [[Gallo-Roman]] language, spoken in Normandy. It is one of the [[Oil languages]] alongside, among others, the [[Picard language|Picard]] and the [[Walloon language|Walloon]]. The Norman language is modified in contact with the [[Anglo-Saxon]] language. It then integrates words and phrases from English and will give birth to a dialect, [[Anglo-Norman (language)|Anglo-Norman]], still spoken on the [[Anglo-Norman isles]]. Anglo-Norman can be described as a [[vernacular language]], on English soil in the XIth century, in the field of literature, culture, court and among the clergy. French was therefore, at first, spoken in England under the form of this Anglo-Norman dialect.

During the XIIth century, continental French has a greater influence on Old English. It acquires great prestige in England, especially within the aristocracy and the clergy. It becomes the language of law and justice nationwide. Rich and noble families, most of them of Norman origin, teach their children French or send them to study in France. The expansion of the French language in England was also encouraged by royal marriages. From [[Henry II Plantagenet]] and [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] at the beginning of the century, to [[Henri VI]] and [[Marguerite of Anjou|Marguerite]] in the XVth century, all kings of England married French princesses. These marriages made French the language of the English court for several centuries and were decisive in strengthening the use of French in England. This period (XIIth-XVth centuries) is characterized by a massive influx of French words into Old English vocabulary.&lt;ref name="le-mot-juste-en-anglais"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.le-mot-juste-en-anglais.com/2013/09/linfluence-du-francais-sur-la-langue-anglaise.html |title=Comment le français a influencé la langue anglaise |website=Le mot juste en anglais |accessdate=2018-11-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120221242/https://www.le-mot-juste-en-anglais.com/2013/09/linfluence-du-francais-sur-la-langue-anglaise.html# |archive-date=2018-11-20 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1204, [[Philippe Auguste]] Normandy is officially annexed to the kingdom of France, politically isolating England from the continent. Normans who choose to stay in England move further away from France and, therefore, from the French language. Keeping its status as the language of justice and the language of power, England saw the first teaching manuals for teaching French to the English. These manuals were intended for English nobles who wish to perfect their knowledge of French and teach it to their children. Two types of French spoken in the higher spheres of English society can be distinguished during the XIIIth century : the Anglo-Norman dialect, which was the aristocrats' mother tongue, and a more prestigious type of French as a second language. Knowing "parisian" French was a mark of social distinction. As a language of culture, French supplanted Latin from the XIIth century onward as the language of diplomacy and worldly relations throughout Europe. The mass and influence of French literature reinforced its reputation and appeal.

=== The developing use of French ===
The [[XVIth century]], that of the [[Renaissance]], is a decisive century for French since king [[François I of France]], through the [[Ordonnance de Villers-Cotterêts]] ([[1539]]), makes French the official language of administration in the whole kingdom.
Although troubled by the [[European wars of religion]], the [[Italian Wars]], the language is marked by intellectual, technical and scientific effervescence. It ushered in an era of prosperity that would also spread to England through French.

The XVIIth century announces the apogee of the Kingdom of France. This period was characterized by the political, literary and artistic prestige of France and the French language. Peace restored and unity ensured in the country, economy grew considerably. Personalities such as the King [[Henri IV of France|Henri IV]], the [[Cardinal of Richelieu]] or the [[Sun King]] contribute to fixing and enhancing the French language in Europe, the Americas, India and Oceania.

The creation of the [[Académie française]] by Richelieu in 1635, under [[Louis XIII]], was a step that led to the standardization of French in continental Europe and abroad, including England. French is then the second language of all the elites in Europe, from Turkey to Ireland and from Moscow to Lisbon. The greatest scholars and intellectuals, writers and scientists, express themselves and correspond in this new standardised French. French is considered a perfect language, whose beauty and elegance are determined by the development of scientific logic, aided by dictionaries and grammars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/caief_0571-5865_1992_num_44_1_1775|title=Le Français face à l'anglais : aspects linguistiques|first=Michael D.|last=Picone|date=22 November 1992|publisher=|journal=Cahiers de l'Association internationale des études francaises|volume=44|issue=1|pages=9–23|doi=10.3406/caief.1992.1775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the XXIst Century ==
The geographical use of French has continuously and greatly diversified in the last five hundred years, with countries and states like [[New-Brunswick]], [[Quebec]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Benin]], [[Togo]], [[Guinea]], [[Cameroon]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Madagascar]], [[Mauritius]], [[Tchad]], [[Djibouti]], [[Senegal]], [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Lebanon]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Monaco]], [[Aosta Valley]], [[French Polynesia]], [[New Caledonia]], and [[Vanuatu]] adopting it as their official language. This geographical diversity has led to many different contacts with [[vernacular]] dialects, regional and international languages, from which French has often been enriched locally.
In a number of countries and regions where French shares co-officiality with English (Cameroon, [[Canada]], [[Jersey]], [[Mauritius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://andre.thibault.pagesperso-orange.fr/IleMaurice.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311113430/http://andre.thibault.pagesperso-orange.fr/IleMaurice.pdf# |archive-date=2016-03-11 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rwanda]], Vanuatu), particular lexical regionalisms are observed where French and English terms are used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avenir-langue-francaise.fr/articles.php?pg=850|title=Avenir de la Langue Française (ALF) - Ile Maurice|first=|last=MAR|website=www.avenir-langue-francaise.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The contribution of the French lexicon to English ==
Several elements must be observed.

* Sometimes, the English words' form has kept traces of Old French, written or oral, such as certain consonants (''forest'' / forest) or certain vowels or diphthongs (''veil'' / voil; ''leisure'' / leisure), the current French sometimes deviating more from its old form than the English (i.e. Old French ''ante'' gives "tante" in modern French and is written 'aunt' in modern English).
* Many English nouns, verbs and adjectives borrowed from Old French have not always kept the meaning they had in Old French. Sometimes, they have developed a different meaning from French. In both cases, these words are [[false friend]]s (''egre'' giving 'sour' (''aigre'') in French while mutating into 'eager' in English).
* Other English words are composed of both words of French and Germanic origins (''handkerchief'': ''hand'' is from the proto-Germanic ''k'''hand'''uz'' and ''kerchief'' is a mutation on the old French ''core chief'')
* Some forms of Old French did not survive in modern French, while they still exist in English (''soulace'',''conceler'',''estriver'',''gone'').
* It is not uncommon either for an English concept to have two or even three vocabulary words to describe it, one of French origin, a part from proto-Germanic and another of Latin origin (''royal'', ''kingly'', and ''regal'' all mean the same thing, 'royal').
* Most of the English words ending in ''-ous'', ''-ty'' (on the model of ''-té''),''-tion'', ''-ture'', ''-ture'', ''-ent'' are of French origin.
* Uses in social and intellectual life, but also certain domestic and food uses, demonstrate the omnipresence of French in English society in many fields, for example the names of meat: "beef" comes from the French ''buef'' (beef), "mutton" from ''moton'' (sheep), "pork" from ''pork'', "veal" from ''vel'' (calf).
* Some words borrowed in the XIXth and XXth centuries are still considered foreign words, French words (such as ''chic''). They are generally used by educated English people or by the press and other media and are seen as part of a distinguished language.
* Some [[Anglicisms]] are actually words that were borrowed from French a long time ago and have recently been borrowed back from English (such as ''bacon'').

The following French glossary in English is in no way exhaustive. These words come as examples to illustrate the countless French words that are part of the English language.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

In this section, examples of French-to-English lexical contributions are classified by field and in chronological order. The periods during which these words were used in the English language are specified as much as possible. It is not always possible to state with certainty the precise period from which a word was borrowed or integrated.

The English word is on the left, with its current French equivalent in brackets, then comes its Old French origin in bold and the century of its introduction on the right.

An '''interlanguage''' is an [[idiolect]] that has been developed by a learner of a [[second language]] (or L2) which preserves some features of their [[first language]] (or L1), and can also overgeneralize some L2 writing and speaking rules. These two characteristics of an interlanguage result in the system's unique linguistic organization.

An interlanguage is [[idiosyncratic]]ally based on the learners' experiences with the L2. It can "[[Interlanguage fossilization|fossilize]]", or cease developing, in any of its developmental stages. The interlanguage rules are claimed to be shaped by several factors, including L1-transfer, previous learning strategies, strategies of L2 acquisition (i.e., simplification), L2 [[Communication strategies in second-language acquisition|communication strategies]] (i.e., circumlocution), and overgeneralization of L2 language patterns.

Interlanguage is based on the theory that there is a dormant psychological framework in the human brain that is activated when one attempts to learn a second language. Interlanguage theory is often credited to [[Larry Selinker]], who coined the terms "interlanguage" and "fossilization." [[Uriel Weinreich]] is credited with providing the foundational information that was the basis of Selinker's research. Selinker (1972) noted that in a given situation, the utterances produced by a learner are different from those [[native speaker]]s would produce had they attempted to convey the same meaning. This comparison suggests the existence of a separate linguistic system. This system can be observed when studying the utterances of the learner who attempts to produce meaning in their L2 speech; it is not seen when that same learner performs form-focused tasks, such as oral drills in a classroom.

Interlanguage can be variable across different contexts; for example, it may be more accurate, complex and fluent in one domain than in another.

To study the psychological processes involved one can compare the interlanguage utterances of the learner with two things:
#Utterances in the native language (L1) to convey the same message produced by the learner. 
#Utterances in the target language (L2) to convey the same message, produced by a native speaker of that language.

It is possible to apply an interlanguage perspective to a learner's underlying knowledge of the target language sound system (interlanguage [[phonology]]), grammar (morphology and syntax), vocabulary (lexicon), and language-use norms found among learners (interlanguage [[pragmatics]]).

By describing the ways in which learner language conforms to universal linguistic norms, interlanguage research has contributed greatly to our understanding of [[linguistic universals]] in [[second-language acquisition]].

== Background ==

Before the interlanguage hypothesis rose to prominence, the principal theory of second-language (L2) development was [[contrastive analysis]]. This theory assumed that learners' errors were caused by the difference between their L1 and L2. This approach was deficit-focused, in the sense that speech errors were thought to arise randomly and should be corrected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Key Concepts in Second Language Acquisition|last = Loewen, Shawn;|first = Reinders, Hayo|publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-230-23018-7|location = New York|pages = 98}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further assumption followed that a sufficiently thorough analysis of the differences between learners' first and second languages could predict all of the difficulties they would face.{{sfn|Tarone|2006}} This assumption was not based in rigorous analysis of learner language but rather was often anecdotal, and researchers' claims were prone to [[confirmation bias]].{{sfn|Tarone|2006}}

[[Robert Lado]] (1957) held that the claims of contrastive analysis should be viewed as hypothetical unless and until they were based on systematic analyses of learner speech data.{{sfn|Tarone|2006}} Around this time, second-language acquisition research shifted from hypotheses of language learning and the development of language-teaching materials to the systematic analysis of learner speech and writing with the practice of [[Error analysis (linguistics)|error analysis]].{{sfn|Tarone|2006}} Although this was initially done to validate the claims of contrastive analysis, researchers found that many learner behaviours could not be easily explained by transfer from learners' L1 to their L2.{{sfn|Tarone|2006}}

The idea that language learners' linguistic systems were different from both their L1 and L2 was developed independently at around the same time by several different researchers.{{sfn|Tarone|2006}} William Nemser called it an ''approximative system'' and [[Pit Corder]] called it ''transitional competence''.

== Variability ==
Interlanguage is claimed to be a language in its own right. Learner language [[Variation (linguistics)|varies]] much more than native-speaker language. Selinker noted that in a given situation the utterances produced by the learner are different from those native speakers would produce had they attempted to convey the same meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Selinker|first1=L|title=Interlanguage|journal=International Review of Applied Linguistics|date=1972|volume=10|pages=209–241}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comparison reveals a separate linguistic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tarone|first1=E|contribution=Interlanguage|editor-last=Berns|editor-first=Margie|title=The concise encyclopedia of applied linguistics|date=2010|publisher=Elsevier|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-08-096502-4|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interlanguage can be observed to be variable across different contexts. For example, it may be more accurate, complex and fluent in one discourse domain than in another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kasper|first1=Gabriele,|last2=Blum-Kulka|first2=Shoshana, eds.|title=Interlanguage pragmatics|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-506602-2|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Variability is observed when comparing the utterances of the learner in conversation to form-focused tasks, such as memory-based oral drills in a classroom. Spontaneous conversation is more likely to involve the use of interlanguage. A learner may produce a target-like variant (e.g. 'I don't') in one context and a non-target like variant (e.g. 'me no') in another. Scholars from different traditions have taken opposing views on the importance of this phenomenon. Those who bring a [[Noam Chomsky|Chomskyan]] perspective to second-language acquisition typically regard variability as nothing more than performance errors, and not worthy of systematic inquiry. On the other hand, those who approach it from a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] or [[psycholinguistics|psycholinguistic]] orientation view variability as an inherent feature of the learner's interlanguage. In these approaches, a learner's preference for one linguistic variant over another can depend on social (contextual) variables such as the status or role of the person the learner is speaking to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kasper|first1=Gabriele|last2=Blum-Kulka|first2=Shoshana, eds.|title=Interlanguage pragmatics|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-506602-2|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preference can also be based on linguistic variables such as the phonological environment or neighboring features marked for formality or informality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fasold|first1=R|last2=Preston|first2=D|chapter=The psycholinguistic unity of inherent variability: Old Occam whips out his razor|pages=45–69|editor1-last=Bayley|editor1-first=R|editor2-last=Lucas|editor2-first=C|date=2007|title=Sociolinguistic Variation: Theory, methods, and applications|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variability in learner language distinguishes between "free variation", which has not been shown to be systematically related to accompanying linguistic or social features, and "systematic variation", which has.

=== Free variation ===

Free variation in the use of a language feature is usually taken as a sign that it has not been fully acquired. The learner is still trying to figure out what rules govern the use of alternate forms. This type of variability seems to be most common among beginning learners, and may be entirely absent among the more advanced.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

=== Systematic variation ===

Systematic variation is brought about by changes in the linguistic, psychological, and social context. Linguistic factors are usually extremely local. For example, in earlier stages of acquisition, a learner will often display systematic constraints on their ability to use the correct tense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolfram|first1=Walt|contribution=Systematic variability in second-language tense marking|editor-last=Eisenstein|editor-first=Miriam R.|title=The dynamic interlanguage: Empirical studies in second-language variation|date=1989|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York|isbn=0-306-43174-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may say "Last year we travel to the ocean" rather than "Last year we travelled to the ocean." They also tend to make more mistakes when the word following a [[grammatical tense|tensed]] word begins with a consonant (e.g., burned bacon). But they will show higher accuracy when the word following the tensed word begins with a nonconsonant (e.g., burned eggs).

=== Other factors ===

Social factors may include a change in register or the familiarity of interlocutors. In accordance with [[communication accommodation theory]], learners may adapt their speech to either converge with, or diverge from, their interlocutor's usage. For example, they may deliberately choose to address a non-target form like "me no" to an English teacher in order to assert identity with a non-mainstream ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rampton|first1=Ben|title=Crossing : Language &amp; Ethnicity among Adolescents.|date=2005|publisher=St Jerome Pub.|location=Manchester|isbn=9781900650779|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important psychological factor is usually regarded as attention to form, which is related to planning time. The more time that learners have to plan, the more target-like their production may be. Thus, literate learners may produce much more target-like forms in a writing task for which they have 30 minutes to plan, than in conversation where they must produce language with almost no planning at all. The impact of alphabetic literacy level on an L2 learner's ability to pay attention to form is as yet unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tarone|first1=Elaine|last2=Bigelow|first2=Martha|last3=Hansen|first3=Kit|title=Literacy and second language oracy|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-442300-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[#Affective factors|Affective factors]] also play an important role in systematic variation. For example, learners in a stressful situation (such as a formal exam) may produce fewer target-like forms than they would in a comfortable setting. This clearly interacts with social factors, and attitudes toward the interlocutor and topic also play important roles.

== Stages of development ==

Individuals learning a second language may not always hear spoken L2 words as separate units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Altarriba|first1=Jeanette|last2=Heredia|first2=Roberto R., eds.|title=An introduction to bilingualism : principles and practies|date=2008|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8058-5135-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some words might blend together and become a single unit in the learner's L2 system. The blended words are called "prefabricated patterns" or "chunks". These chunks are often not immediately obvious to the learner or anyone that listens to them speak, but may be noticed as the learner's L2 system becomes more developed and they use the chunk in a context where it does not apply. For example, if an English learner hears sentences beginning with "do you", they may associate it with being an indicator of a question but not as two separate words. To them, the word is "doyou". They may happen to say "What do you doing?" instead of "What are you doing?" Eventually the learner will learn to break the chunk up in to its component words and use them correctly.

When learners experience significant restructuring in their L2 systems, they sometimes show a U-shaped learning pattern. For instance, a group of English language learners moved, over time, from accurate usage of the "-ing" present progressive morpheme, to incorrectly omitting it, and finally, back to correct usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lightbown|first1=P|contribution=Exploring relationships between developmental and instructional sequences in L2 acquisition|editor-last1=Seliger|editor-first1=H|editor-last2=Long|editor-first2=M.H.|title=Classroom oriented research in second language acquisition|date=1983|publisher=Newbury House|location=Rowley (MA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally the period of incorrect usage is seen as a learning regression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Altarriba|first1=Jeanette|last2=Heredia|first2=Roberto R., eds.|title=An introduction to bilingualism : principles and practies|date=2008|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8058-5135-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is likely that when the learners first acquired the new "-ing" morpheme or "chunk", they were not aware of all of the rules that apply to its use. As their knowledge of tense in English expanded, this disrupted their correct usage of the morpheme. They eventually returned to correct usage when they gained greater understanding of the tense rules in English. These data provide evidence that the learners were initially producing output based on rote memory of individual words containing the present progressive "-ing" morpheme. However, in the second stage their systems contained the rule that they should use the bare infinitive form to express present action, without a separate rule for the use of "-ing". Finally, they learned the rule for appropriate use of "-ing".

The "chunking" method enables a learner to practice speaking their L2 before they correctly break the chunk up in to its component parts. According to interlanguage theory, this seeming progression and regression of language learning is an important and positive manifestation of the learner's developing understanding of the grammar of the target language.

== Fossilization ==
{{Main|Interlanguage fossilization}}
An interlanguage can fossilize, or cease developing, in any of its developmental stages. Fossilization is the process of 'freezing' of the transition between the L1 and L2, and is regarded as the final stage of interlanguage development. It can occur even in motivated learners who are continuously exposed to their L2 or have adequate learning support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Han|first1=ZhaoHong|title=Fossilization in adult second language acquisition|date=2004|publisher=Multilingual Matters|location=Clevedon|isbn=1-85359-686-8|pages=12–24|edition=Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons for this phenomenon may be due to complacency or inability to overcome the obstacles to acquiring native proficiency in the L2. Fossilization occurs often in adult language learners. It can also occur when a learner succeeds in conveying messages with their current L2 knowledge. The need to correct the form/structure is therefore not present. The learner fossilizes the form instead of correcting it.

== Linguistic universals ==
Research on [[universal grammar]] (UG) has had a significant effect on [[second-language acquisition]] (SLA) theory. In particular, scholarship in the interlanguage tradition has sought to show that learner languages conform to UG at all stages of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=VanPatten|first1=Bill|last2=Williams|first2=Jessica|title=Theories in second language acquisition : an introduction|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-82421-7|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interlanguage UG differs from native UG in that interlanguage UGs vary greatly in mental representations from one L2 user to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=VanPatten|first1=Bill|last2=Williams|first2=Jessica|title=Theories in second language acquisition : an introduction|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-82421-7|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This variability arises from differing relative influences on the interlanguage UG, such as existing L1 knowledge and UG constraints. An example of a UG constraint is an "[[locality (linguistics)#Wh-island constraint|island constraint]]," where the ''wh''-phrase in a question has a finite number of possible positions. Island constraints are based on the concept that there are certain syntactical domains within a sentence that act as phrase boundaries. It is theorized that the same constraints that act on a native UG are also often present in an interlanguage UG.

== Versus creoles and pidgins ==

The concept of interlanguage is closely related to other types of language, especially [[creole language|creoles]] and [[pidgin]]s. Each of these languages has its own grammar and phonology. The difference is mostly one of variability, as a learner's interlanguage is spoken only by the learner and changes frequently as they become more proficient in the language. In contrast, creoles and pidgins are generally the product of groups of people in contact with another language, and therefore may be more stable.

'''Kaskian''' (Kaskean) was a non-[[Indo-European language]] of the [[Kaskians]] of northeastern [[Bronze Age]] Anatolia, in the mountains along the [[Black Sea]] coast.

It is sometimes suspected that Kaskian was related to the pre-Hittite [[Hattic language]], based on [[toponym]]s and personal names. There may also be connections to the [[Northwest Caucasian languages]]; the name ''Kaskian''&lt;ref&gt;Hittite ''Kaškaš'', Assyrian ''Kaška'', Egyptian ''Kškš''&lt;/ref&gt; may be [[cognate]] with an old name for [[Circassia]],&lt;ref&gt;Arabic ''kašak'', Old Georgian ''kaški'', Old Armenian ''gašk'', Old Russian ''kasogi'', Ossetic ''kæsæg'', Byzantine Greek Κασαχία ''Kasakhía''&lt;/ref&gt; and the name of one of the tribes in the Kaskian confederation, the Abešla, may be cognate with the endonym of the [[Abkhaz people]] and some Circassian people,&lt;ref&gt;Abkhaz Аҧсуа ''Apswa'', Old Georgian ''apsil-, apšil-'', Old Armenian ''apšeł-k'', Greek Αψίλαι ''apsílai'', Latin ''Absilae''&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting the Kaskians proper and Abešla might have been the ancestors of the [[Circassians]] and other Caucasian peoples.&lt;ref&gt;George Hewitt, 1998. ''The Abkhazians'', p 49&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been conjectured that Kaskian might belong to the [[Zan language|Zan]] family of languages, and have affinities to [[Megrelian]] or [[Laz language|Laz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Singer |first=Itamar |date=2007 |title=Who were the Kaška? |url=https://colchianstudies.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/singer__kaska__phasis_20071.pdf|journal=Phasis |publisher=Ivane Javakhishvili Tblisi State University |volume=10 |issue=II |pages=178 |doi= |access-date=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11094">Many countries have a '''language policy''' designed to favor or discourage the use of a particular [[language]] or set of languages. Although nations historically have used language policies most often to promote one [[official language]] at the expense of others, many countries now have policies designed to protect and promote 
regional and ethnic languages whose viability is threatened. Indeed, whilst the existence of [[Minority language|linguistic minorities]] within their jurisdiction has often been considered to be a potential threat to internal cohesion, States also understand that providing language rights to minorities may be more in their long term interest, as a means of gaining citizens' trust in the central government.&lt;ref&gt;Arzoz, X., 'The Nature of Language Rights'. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe (2007): 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Language policy is what a government does either officially through [[legislation]], court decisions or policy to determine how languages are used, cultivate language skills needed to meet national priorities or to establish the rights of individuals or groups to use and maintain languages. The scope of language policy varies in practice from State to State. This may be explained by the fact that language policy is often based on contingent historical reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Id., at page 23&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, States also differ as to the degree of explicitness with which they implement a given language policy. The French [[Toubon Law|Toubon]] law is a good example of explicit language policy. The same may be said for the [[Charter of the French Language|Charter]] of the French Language in [[Quebec]].&lt;ref&gt;Van der Jeught, S., EU Language Law (2015), Europa Law Publishing: Groningen, 15 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The preservation of [[cultural diversity|cultural]] and [[linguistic diversity]] in today's world is a major concern to many scientists, artists, writers, politicians, leaders of linguistic communities, and defenders of [[linguistic human rights]]. More than half of the 6000 languages currently spoken in the world are estimated to be in danger of disappearing during the 21st century. Many factors affect the existence and usage of any given human language, including the size of the native speaking population, its use in formal communication, and the geographical dispersion and the socio-economic weight of its speakers. National language policies can either mitigate or exacerbate the effects of some of these factors.

For example, according to [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], "Native tongue title and language rights should be promoted. The government ought to define Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander vernaculars as official languages of Australia. We must change the linguistic landscape of Whyalla and elsewhere. Signs should be in both English and the local indigenous language. We ought to acknowledge intellectual property of indigenous knowledge including language, music and dance."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]], [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/opinion/stop-revive-and-survive/story-e6frgcko-1226385194433 "Stop, revive and survive"], ''The Australian Higher Education'', June 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many ways in which language policies can be categorized. It was elaborated by [[Université Laval]] [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguist]] [[Jacques Leclerc (linguist)|Jacques Leclerc]] for the French-language Web site ''L'aménagement linguistique dans le monde'' put on line by the [[CIRAL]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;(French) Leclerc, Jacques. [http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/axl/monde/index_politique-lng.htm "Index par politiques linguistiques"] in ''L'aménagement linguistique dans le monde'', Québec, TLFQ, [[Université Laval]], December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The collecting, translating and classifying of language policies started in 1988 and culminated in the publishing of ''Recueil des législations linguistiques dans le monde'' (vol. I to VI) at Presses de l'Université Laval in 1994. The work, containing some 470 language laws, and the research leading to publication, were subsidised by the [[Office québécois de la langue française]].&lt;ref&gt;Leclerc, Jacques. [http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/axl/monde/historique_du_site.htm "Historique du site du CIRAL au TLFQ"] in ''L'aménagement linguistique dans le monde'', Québec, TLFQ, [[Université Laval]], August 16, 2007 (in French).&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2008, the Web site presented the linguistic portrait and language policies in 354 States or autonomous territories in 194 recognised countries.&lt;ref&gt;Leclerc, Jacques. [http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/axl/index.shtml "Page d'accueil"] in ''L'aménagement linguistique dans le monde'', Québec, TLFQ, [[Université Laval]], 2007 (in French).&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''lingua franca''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-Lingua franca-pronunciation.ogg|ˌ|l|ɪ|ŋ|ɡ|w|ə|_|ˈ|f|r|æ|ŋ|k|ə}}; {{literal translation|Frankish tongue}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/lingua-franca |title=lingua franca – definition of lingua franca in English from the Oxford dictionary |publisher=Oxforddictionaries.com |date= |accessdate=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as a '''bridge language''', '''common language''', '''trade language''', '''auxiliary language, vehicular language''', or '''link language''' is a language or [[dialect]] systematically used to make communication possible between people who do not share a [[First language|native language]] or dialect, particularly when it is a third language that is distinct from both of the speakers' native languages.&lt;ref&gt;Viacheslav A.

Lingua francas have developed around the world throughout human history, sometimes for commercial reasons (so-called "trade languages" facilitated trade) but also for cultural, religious, diplomatic and administrative convenience, and as a means of exchanging information between scientists and other scholars of different nationalities.&lt;ref name="Nye"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nye|first1=Mary Jo|title=Speaking in Tongues: Science's centuries-long hunt for a common language|journal=Distillations|date=2016|volume=2|issue=1|pages=40–43|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/speaking-in-tongues|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gordin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gordin|first1=Michael D.|title=Scientific Babel: How Science Was Done Before and After Global English|date=2015|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=9780226000299}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is taken from the medieval [[Mediterranean Lingua Franca]], a [[Romance languages|Romance]]-based [[pidgin language]] used by European merchants and sailors during the [[2nd millennium]]. A [[world language]] – a language spoken internationally and learned and spoken by a large number of people – is a language that may function as a global lingua franca.

== Characteristics ==
Lingua Franca refers to any language used for communication between people who do not share a native language.&lt;ref&gt;"vehicular, adj." ''OED Online''. Oxford University Press, July 2018. Web. 1 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; It can refer to [[Mixed language|hybrid languages]] such as [[pidgin]]s and [[creole languages|creoles]] used for communication between language groups. It can also refer to languages which are native to one nation (often a colonial power) but used as a [[second language]] for [[communication]] between groups. Finally, lingua franca can refer to a [[List of lingua francas|third language]] which allows inter-comprehension among people speaking different [[First language|mother tongues]] as a neutral language or [[jargon]] of which nobody can claim ownership&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.termcoord.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lingua_franca.pdf|title=LINGUA FRANCA:CHIMERA OR REALITY?|last=|first=|date=|website=|isbn=9789279189876|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Lingua Franca is a functional term, independent of any linguistic history or language structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~patrickp/Courses/PCs/IntroPidginsCreoles.htm Intro Sociolinguistics] – ''Pidgin and Creole Languages: Origins and Relationships'' – Notes for LG102, – University of Essex, Prof. Peter L. Patrick – Week 11, Autumn term.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Whereas a [[vernacular]] language is the native language of a specific geographical community, a lingua franca is used beyond the boundaries of its original community, for trade, religious, political or academic reasons.  For example, [[English language|English]] is a vernacular in the United Kingdom but is used as a lingua franca in the [[Philippines]].  [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[French language|French]], [[Mandarin language|Mandarin Chinese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and  [[Russian language|Russian]], serve a similar purpose as industrial/educational lingua francas, across regional and national boundaries.

[[International auxiliary language]]s such as [[Esperanto]] and [[Lingua Franca Nova]] have not had a great degree of adoption globally so they cannot be described as global lingua francas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/ict/language-technologies/docs/lingua-franca-en.pdf|title=Studies on translation and multilingualism|last=Directorate-General for Translation|first=European Commission|date=2011|website=cordis.europa.eu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115090926/http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/ict/language-technologies/docs/lingua-franca-en.pdf|archive-date=2012-11-15|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The term ''lingua franca'' derives from [[Mediterranean Lingua Franca]],  the "language of the Francs", "Francs" being the term used to refer to all [[Western European|Western Europeans]] as opposed to the [[Greeks]] — is considered to be a translation of the Arab lûghat al-Ifranj, which appears for the first time in an [[Arabic]] text from the 9th century. However, Western speakers and their contemporaries only began to use the term "lingua franca" to describe this phenomenon at the beginning of the 16th century&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and the language that people around the [[Levant]] and the eastern Mediterranean Sea used as the main language of commerce and diplomacy from late [[Middle Ages|medieval times]], especially during the [[Renaissance era]], to the 18th century and allowed communication between the people living, fighting in the area without becoming the vernacular language of any of them. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/lingua-franca|title=lingua franca {{!}} linguistics|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At that time, [[Italian language|Italian]]-speakers dominated seaborne commerce in the port cities of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and a simplified version of Italian, including many [[loan words]] from [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Old French language|Old French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Occitan]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as well as [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] came to be widely used as the "lingua franca" (in the generic sense used) of the region.

In Lingua Franca (the specific language), ''lingua'' means a language, as in Portuguese and Italian, and ''franca'' is related to ''phrankoi'' in Greek and ''faranji'' in Arabic as well as the equivalent Italian. In all three cases, the literal sense is "[[Frankish language|Frankish]]", but the name actually applied to all Western Europeans during the late [[Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref name=HEL&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.komvos.edu.gr/dictonlineplsql/simple_search.display_full_lemma?the_lemma_id=16800&amp;target_dict=1|title=''Lexico Triantaphyllide'' online dictionary, Greek Language Center (''Kentro Hellenikes Glossas''), lemma Franc ( Φράγκος ''Phrankos''), ''Lexico tes Neas Hellenikes Glossas'', G.Babiniotes, Kentro Lexikologias(Legicology Center) LTD Publications|isbn=960-86190-1-7|quote=Franc and (prefix) franco- (Φράγκος ''Phrankos'' and φράγκο- ''phranko-''|publisher=Komvos.edu.gr|accessdate=2015-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/etymologicaldict00weekuoft/ |title=An etymological dictionary of modern English : Weekley, Ernest, 1865–1954 : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/14047074/Dictionary-English-Etymology-Origins-A-Short-Etymological-Dictionary-of-Modern-English-Rouledge-1958-Parridge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012185830/http://www.scribd.com/doc/14047074/Dictionary-English-Etymology-Origins-A-Short-Etymological-Dictionary-of-Modern-English-Rouledge-1958-Parridge|date=October 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Douglas Harper Etymology Dictionary states that the term ''Lingua Franca'' (as the name of the particular language) was first recorded in English during the 1670s,&lt;ref name="Harper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=lingua+franca |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; although an even earlier example of the use of ''Lingua Franca'' in English is attested from 1632, where it is also referred to as "Bastard Spanish".&lt;ref name="Morgan"&gt;{{cite book |last=Morgan |first=J. |year=1632 |title=A Compleat History of the Present Seat of War in Africa, Between the Spaniards and Algerines |page=98 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6M8TAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA98#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=June 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As recently as the late 20th century, some restricted the use of the generic term to mean only [[Mixed language|hybrid languages]] that are used as vehicular languages, its original meaning, but it now refers to any vehicular language.&lt;ref&gt;Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language, Simon and Schuster, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is well established in its naturalization to English, which is why major dictionaries do not italicize it as a "foreign" term.&lt;ref name="OxfordDictionaries"&gt;{{Citation |author=Oxford Dictionaries |authorlink=OxfordDictionaries.com |title=Oxford Dictionaries Online |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AHD"&gt;{{Citation |author=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |url=https://ahdictionary.com/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MW_Collegiate"&gt;{{Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |authorlink=Merriam-Webster |title=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/collegiate/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its plurals in English are '''lingua francas''' and '''linguae francae''',&lt;ref name="AHD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MW_Collegiate"/&gt; with the first of those being first-listed&lt;ref name="AHD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MW_Collegiate"/&gt; or only-listed&lt;ref name="OxfordDictionaries"/&gt; in major dictionaries.

{{main article|List of lingua francas}}
The use of lingua francas has existed since antiquity. The first example of lingua franca in the ancient world, before [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin|Latin,]] was [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Latin]] and [[Koine Greek]] were the lingua francas of the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[Hellenistic]] culture. [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] (died out during [[Classical antiquity]]) and then [[Aramaic]] remained the common languages of a large part of Western Asia from several earlier empires.&lt;ref&gt;Ostler, 2005 pp. 38–40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ostler, 2010 pp. 163–167&lt;/ref&gt; {{Full citation needed|date= August 2018}}

In certain countries, the lingua franca is also the national language. [[Indonesia language|Indonesian]] has the same function in [[Indonesia]], although [[Javanese language|Javanese]] has more native speakers. Still, Indonesian is the sole official language and is spoken throughout the country. Also [[Persian language|Persian]] is both the lingua franca of [[Iran]] and its national language.

The [[Hindustani language]] ([[Hindi]]-[[Urdu]]) is the lingua franca of [[Pakistan]] and [[Northern India]].&lt;ref name="siddiqi1994"&gt;{{Citation | title=Hindustani-English code-mixing in modern literary texts | author=Mohammad Tahsin Siddiqi | year=1994 | isbn= | publisher=University of Wisconsin | url=https://books.google.com/?id=vnrTAAAAMAAJ | quote=''...

The only documented [[sign language]] used as a lingua franca is [[Plains Indian Sign Language]], used across much of [[North America]]. It was used as a second language across many indigenous peoples. Alongside or a derivation of Plains Indian Sign Language was [[Plateau Sign Language]], now extinct. [[Inuit Sign Language]] could be a similar case in the Arctic among the [[Inuit]] for communication across oral language boundaries, but little research exists.

In the [[European Union]], the use of [[English as a lingua franca]] has led to the emergence of a new dialect called [[Euro English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mollin|first1=Sandra|title=Euro-English assessing variety status|date=2005|publisher=Narr|location=Tübingen|isbn=382336250X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wildgansflug.jpg|thumb|A skein of geese]]

This is a list of English [[terms of venery]] (''venery'' being an archaic word for hunting), comprising terms from a tradition that arose in the [[Late Middle Ages]], at least partly from the ''[[Book of Saint Albans]]'' of [[1486]], a historic list of "company terms". The present list also includes more common collective terms (such as "herd" and "flock") for some animals.

{{Compact ToC|seealso=yes|refs=yes|align=center}}

Standard terms for particular groups are listed first in each group and shown in bold.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2504">In [[linguistics]], [[language]]s are often studied in terms of six major subsystems, which relate to major subfields within linguistics. In addition, particular subfields of linguistic inquiry may divide their subject matter into more specific subsystems. This list contains links to commonly studied language subsystems.

== Major subsystems ==

Linguists recognize seven major language subsystems:

* [[Phonetics]], the [[sound]]s of human [[speech]], including their physiological production, acoustic properties, auditory perception, and neurophysiological status;
* [[Phonology]], the systematic use of sound to encode meaning in any spoken [[human language]] ([[natural language]] or [[constructed language]]);
* [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]], the structure of meaningful units of a language, such as [[word]]s and [[affix]]es;
* [[Syntax]], the principles and rules for constructing [[phrase]]s, [[clause]]s, and the like in human languages;
* [[Semantics]], the [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaningful]] content of words, [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]], or other language elements;
* [[Pragmatics]], the ways in which [[Context (language use)|context]] contributes to meaning in natural language use; and
* [[Lexicology]], the study of words.

This division varies among linguists and authors. For example, phonetics and phonology are occasionally merged into one subsystem. Morphology and lexicology can also be merged.

== Sociolinguistics ==

* The term ''[[Variety (linguistics)|variety]]'' in [[sociolinguistics]] is used as a cover term for dialects, registers, and other forms of language, including standard languages.
** [[Dialect]] refers to a variety that is used by a particular group of speakers.
** [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|Accent]] refers to a specific system of pronunciation.
** [[Idiolect]] refers to the variety that is used by an individual speaker.
** [[Register (sociolinguistics)|Register]] or [[Stylistics (linguistics)|style]] refer to a variety that is used in a particular setting or for a particular purpose.
** [[Standard language]] is a variety promoted by some social group, either officially or unofficially, as the preferred form.
* [[Abstand and ausbau languages]] are concepts developed by sociolinguists to describe related language varieties, ranging from dialects of a single language to distinct languages.

There are 53 '''municipalities of Finland in which Finnish is not the sole official language'''.&lt;ref name="ruotsin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="luoma"/&gt; In [[Finland]], as of December 31, 2013, 89.3% of the population speak [[Finnish language|Finnish]], 5.3% [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and 0.04% [[Sami languages]].&lt;ref name="statistica"&gt;[http://pxweb2.stat.fi/Dialog/varval.asp?ma=060_vaerak_tau_107&amp;ti=V%E4est%F6+kielen+mukaan+sek%E4+ulkomaan+kansalaisten+m%E4%E4r%E4+ja+maa%2Dpinta%2Dala+alueittain+1980+%2D+2011&amp;path=../Database/StatFin/vrm/vaerak/&amp;lang=3&amp;multilang=fi "Väestö kielen mukaan sekä ulkomaan kansalaisten määrä ja maa-pinta-ala alueittain 1980 – 2013" ("Population according to language and the number of foreigners and land area by region 1980 – 2013"]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, at the Statistics Finland site; accessed June 18, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Both Finnish and Swedish are [[Languages of Finland|official languages of Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;Heikki E. S. Mattila, ''Comparative Legal Linguistics'', p. 55. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2006, {{ISBN|978-075464-874-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officially, a municipality is bilingual if the minority language group consists of at least 8% of the population, or at least 3,000 speakers.&lt;ref name="ruotsin"&gt;{{fi icon}} [http://www.kunnat.net/fi/kunnat/ruotsinjakaksikielisetkunnat/Diasarjat%20kuntien%20toiminnasta/Ruotsin_ja_kaksikieliset_kunnat_2013.pdf "Ruotsin- ja kaksikieliset kunnat" ("Swedish and Bilingual Municipalities")], at the Association of Finnish Local and Regional Authorities site; accessed June 18, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; A previously bilingual municipality remains so if the linguistic minority proportion drops below 8%, up to 6%. If it drops below 6%, it is possible for the municipality to remain bilingual by government decree, on the recommendation of the municipal council, for a further ten years.&lt;ref name="salo"&gt;Olli-Pekka Salo, "Finland's Official Bilingualism – A Bed of Roses or of Procrustes?", in Jan Blommaert, Sirpa Leppänen, Päivi Pahta (eds.), ''Dangerous Multilingualism: Northern Perspectives on Order, Purity and Normality'', p. 28&amp;ndash;9. Palgrave Macmillan, 2012, {{ISBN|978-023032-141-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Municipalities that make use of the 3,000-speaker rule include the national capital [[Helsinki]] and the cultural center of Swedish Finns, [[Turku]]. On the [[Åland]] archipelago, where Finnish is almost absent from daily life, the language law does not apply. On the mainland, the highest proportion of Swedish-speakers is found on the western coast, in [[Ostrobothnia (region)|Ostrobothnia]].&lt;ref&gt;Claus D. Pusch, "Old Minorities within a Language Space", in Peter Auer, Jürgen Erich Schmidt (eds.), ''Language and Space: An International Handbook of Linguistic Variation, Volume 1'', p. 385&amp;ndash;6. Walter de Gruyter, 2010, {{ISBN|978-311018-002-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 317 [[Municipalities of Finland|Finnish municipalities]], 16 are monolingually Swedish. 33 municipalities are bilingually Finnish and Swedish; of these, 15 have a Swedish-speaking majority and 18 a Finnish-speaking one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/sv/laki/ajantasa/2013/20130053]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ruotsin"/&gt; Four municipalities, all located in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]], have a Finnish-speaking majority and a Sami-speaking minority: [[Enontekiö]], [[Inari, Finland|Inari]], [[Sodankylä]] and [[Utsjoki]].&lt;ref name="luoma"&gt;Kenneth Douglas McRae, Mika Helander, Sari Luoma, ''Conflict and Compromise in Multilingual Societies: Finland, Volume 3'', p. 231. Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1999, {{ISBN|978-088920-347-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, only Swedish was accorded official bilingualism, through a language act of 1922;&lt;ref name="salo"/&gt; similar provisions were extended to Sami through a 1991 law.&lt;ref name="luoma"/&gt; The 1922 law was replaced by new but largely similar legislation in 2003.&lt;ref name="salo"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4594">A '''maxim''' is a concise expression of a fundamental [[morality|moral]] rule or principle, whether considered as [[wikt:objectivity|objective]] or [[subjectivity|subjective]] contingent on one's [[philosophy]]. A maxim is often [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] and motivates specific actions. The ''[[Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy]]'' defines it as:
{{quote|Generally any simple and memorable rule or guide for living; for example, 'neither a borrower nor a lender be'. [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]] speaks of 'a little hoard of maxims preaching down a daughter's heart ([[Locksley Hall]]), and maxims have generally been associated with a 'folksy' or 'copy-book' approach to [[moral]]ity.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy, Maxim (Oxford University Press 2008) p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Deontological ethics==

In [[deontological ethics]], mainly in [[Kantian ethics]], maxims are understood as [[subjectivity|subjective]] principles of action. A maxim is thought to be part of an agent's thought process for every rational action, indicating in its standard form: (1)&amp;nbsp;the action, or type of action; (2)&amp;nbsp;the conditions under which it is to be done; and (3)&amp;nbsp;the end or purpose to be achieved by the action, or the motive. The maxim of an action is often referred to as the agent's intention. In Kantian ethics, the [[categorical imperative]] provides a test on maxims for determining whether the actions they refer to are right, wrong, or permissible.

The categorical imperative is stated canonically as: "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law."&lt;ref name="Ellington"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kant|first=Immanuel|authorlink=Immanuel Kant |translator=James W. Ellington |title=Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals 3rd ed.|publisher=Hackett|date=1993|pages=30|isbn=0-87220-166-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Critique of Practical Reason]]'', [[Immanuel Kant]] provided the following example of a maxim and of how to apply the test of the categorical imperative:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I have, for example, made it my maxim to increase my wealth by any safe means. Now I have a deposit in my hands, the owner of which has died and left no record of it. . . . I therefore apply the maxim to the present case and ask whether it could indeed take the form of a law, and consequently whether I could through my maxim at the same time give such a law as this: that everyone may deny a deposit which no one can prove has been made. I at once become aware that such a principle, as a law, would annihilate itself since it would bring it about that there would be no deposits at all.&lt;ref name="Gregor"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kant|first=Immanuel|authorlink=Immanuel Kant|translator=Mary Gregor |title=Critique of Practical Reason|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1997|pages=25/5:27|isbn=0-521-59051-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also, an action is said to have "moral worth" if the maxim upon which the agent acts cites the purpose of conforming to a moral requirement. That is, a person's action has moral worth when he does his [[duty]] purely for the sake of duty, or does the right thing for the right reason.  Kant himself believed that it is impossible to know whether anyone's action has ever had moral worth. It might appear to someone that he has acted entirely "from duty", but this could always be an illusion of self-interest: of wanting to see oneself in the best, most noble light. This indicates that agents are not always the best judges of their own maxims or motives.

==Personal knowledge==
[[Michael Polanyi]] in his account of [[tacit knowledge]] stressed the importance of the maxim in focusing both explicit and implicit modes of understanding. “Maxims are rules, the correct application of which is part of the art they govern....Maxims can only function within a framework of personal (i.e., experiential) knowledge”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Guy Claxton, ''Live and learn (1992) p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mitigated speech''' is a [[linguistic]] term describing deferential or indirect speech inherent in communication between individuals of perceived [[Geert Hofstede|High Power Distance]] which has been in use for at least two decades with many published references.&lt;ref&gt;Ng, Sik H. and Bradac, James J. : ''Power in Language: Verbal Communication and Social Influence (Language and Language Behavior)''  Sage Publications, Inc (May 25, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, William Peter and Tajfel, Henri: [https://books.google.com/books?id=toHSl37qbfMC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;lpg=PA193&amp;dq=Ng++Bradac+Power+in+Language&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o27ICSXtLK&amp;sig=tHbmqXj0s68-p-ye1JD9ereSDjs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gZTQSdGMCs6dkAXf9-jZCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA193,M1 Social Groups and Identities] Routledge (1996) Retrieved 2009-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kasper, Gabriele and Blum-Kulka, Shoshana: [https://books.google.com/books?id=QAsbd2oi7LMC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;dq=%22mitigated+speech%22+linguistics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UbqYXTVmQU&amp;sig=VrYIEFLQ8TkAo9UnsZS70QHJKRA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7pPQScSEJ4iMkAWllOTjCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result" Interlanguage Pragmatics] Oxford (1993). Retrieved 2009-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Hare, D., and Roscoe, S. ''Flightdeck performance - the human factor''. Ames: Iowa State University Press (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term was popularized by  [[Malcolm Gladwell]] in his book, ''[[Outliers (book)|Outliers]]'', where he defines mitigated speech as "any attempt to downplay or sugarcoat the meaning of what is being said".&lt;ref&gt;Gladwell, Malcolm: ''Outliers: The Story of Success'', Penguin (2008) p.194&lt;/ref&gt; He continues with reference to Fischer and Orasanu,&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Ute and Orasanu, Judith: ''Cultural Diversity and Crew Communication'', paper presented at Astronautical Congress, Amsterdam; American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; to describe 6 degrees of mitigation with which we make suggestions to authority: 

# '''Command''' – "Strategy X is going to be implemented" 
# '''Team Obligation Statement'''  – "We need to try strategy X" 
# '''Team Suggestion''' – "Why don't we try strategy X?" 
# '''Query''' – "Do you think strategy X would help us in this situation?" 
# '''Preference''' – "Perhaps we should take a look at one of these Y alternatives" 
# '''Hint''' – "I wonder if we could run into any roadblocks on our current course" 

Gladwell brings up the concept in the context of how crews relate to each other in the cockpit of a commercial airliner, graphically illustrating the degree to which mitigated speech can be detrimental in high-risk situations which require clear communication.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8309">'''The National Center for Voice and Speech''' (NCVS), is a multi-site research and teaching organization dedicated to studying the characteristics, limitations and enhancement of human voice and speech. The NCVS is located in Salt Lake City, Utah with the Lead Institution located at the University of Utah. NCVS is also a Center at the [[University of Iowa]] where it has laboratories in the Department of Speech Pathology and Audiology.  In addition, the NCVS has collaborators in Denver and at many institutions around the United States.  Its focus is [[vocology]], or the science and practice of voice habilitation.&lt;ref&gt;van Mersbergen M et al. (2001). "Preparation of the speech-language pathologist specializing in voice: an educational survey.", J Voice. 15(2):237-50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Titze, I.R. (1994). Principles of Voice Production, Prentice Hall.  {{ISBN|978-0-13-717893-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Initially conceived as a "center without walls," the NCVS was formally organized in 1990 with the assistance of a grant from the [[National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders]] (NIDCD), an institute of the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH). The NCVS was organized on the premise that a consortium of institutions (including the Wilber James Gould Voice Center at the [[Denver Center for the Performing Arts|DCPA]], [[University of Iowa]], [[University of Utah]], [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]) would be better able to conduct and disseminate research than a single organization. NCVS members, although geographically separate, were linked by a common desire to fully understand the characteristics, limitations and enhancement of human voice and speech.

In 1999, NIDCD discontinued the Multi-Purpose Research and Training Center funding mechanism for the entire institute focusing instead on single-project research awards (R01s). In a July 2000 meeting, however, NCVS investigators voted unanimously to continue the concept of a national resource center for voice and speech, to be driven by a variety of single-project research awards (R01s), as well as health communication, core, and training grants. In 2001, the NCVS moved its central location to Denver, where the otolaryngologist Dr. Wilbur James Gould had founded a center to study the voice and speech patterns of stage performers.

The NCVS team of investigators, led by [[Ingo Titze]], studies the powers, limitations and enhancement of [[human voice]] and [[Speech communication|speech]].  The investigators are scientists, clinicians, educators, engineers and musicians who use diverse backgrounds (i.e., speech-language pathology, [[physics]], [[computer science]], [[acoustics]], [[human voice|vocal performance]], [[biology]], [[medicine]] and [[engineering]]) to work together on voice and speech investigations.  As a direct outgrowth of their work, NCVS members also teach other investigators and practitioners who work with voice, as well as speech clients and the general public.  One example is the Summer Vocology Institute, which trains voice coaches and vocal health professionals in the study of [[Vocology]].

{{Neuropsychology |functions}}

In [[neuropsychology]], [[linguistics]], and the [[philosophy of language]], a '''natural language''' or '''ordinary language''' is any [[language]] that has [[linguistic evolution|evolved]] naturally in humans through use and repetition without conscious planning or premeditation. Natural languages can take different forms, such as [[Vocal language|speech]] or [[Sign language|signing]]. They are distinguished from [[Constructed language|constructed]] and [[formal language]]s such as [[Programming language|those used to program computers]] or to study [[logic]].&lt;ref name="john lyons"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lyons |first=John |title=Natural Language and Universal Grammar |year=1991 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0521246965 |pages=68–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Defining natural language ==

Though the exact definition varies between scholars, natural language can broadly be defined in contrast to artificial or [[constructed language]]s (such as [[Programming language|computer programming languages]] and [[international auxiliary language]]s) and to other [[Biocommunication (science)|communication systems in nature]]. Such examples include bees' [[waggle dance]]&lt;ref name="fernandes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fernandes |first=Keith |title=On the Significance of Speech: How Infants Discover Symbols and Structure |year=2008 |publisher=ProQuest |location=Ann Arbor, MI |isbn=978-1243524065 |pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[whale vocalization|whale song]], to which researchers have found or applied the linguistic cognates of [[dialect]] and even [[syntax]]. 

All [[variety (linguistics)|language varieties]] of [[world language]]s are natural languages, although some varieties are subject to greater degrees of published [[linguistic prescription|prescriptivism]] or [[list of language regulators|language regulation]] than others. Thus [[nonstandard dialect]]s can be viewed as a [[wild type]] in comparison with [[standard language]]s. But even an [[official language]] with a regulating academy, such as [[Standard French]] with the [[Académie française|French Academy]], is classified as a natural language (for example, in the field of [[natural language processing]]), as its prescriptive points do not make it either constructed enough to be classified as a [[constructed language]] or controlled enough to be classified as a [[controlled natural language]].

== Controlled languages ==
{{Main|Controlled natural language}}

Controlled natural languages are subsets of natural languages whose grammars and dictionaries have been restricted in order to reduce or eliminate both ambiguity and complexity (for instance, by cutting down on rarely used superlative or adverbial forms or [[irregular verbs]]). The purpose behind the development and implementation of a controlled natural language typically is to aid non-native speakers of a natural language in understanding it, or to ease computer processing of a natural language. An example of a widely used controlled natural language is [[Simplified Technical English|Simplified English]], which was originally developed for [[aerospace]] industry maintenance manuals.

== Constructed languages and international auxiliary languages ==
{{Main|Constructed language|International auxiliary language}}
Constructed [[international auxiliary language]]s such as [[Esperanto]] and [[Interlingua]] (even those that have [[native speaker]]s) are not generally considered natural languages.&lt;ref name="Gopsill, F. P. 1990"&gt;Gopsill, F. P., "A historical overview of international languages". In ''International languages: A matter for Interlingua''. Sheffield, England: British Interlingua Society, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Natural languages have been used to communicate and have evolved in a natural way, whereas Esperanto was designed by [[L.L. Zamenhof]] selecting elements from natural languages, not grown from natural fluctuations in vocabulary and syntax. Some natural languages have become naturally "standardized" by children's natural tendency to correct for illogical grammatical structures in their parents' speech, which can be seen in the development of [[pidgin]] languages into [[creole language]]s (as explained by Steven Pinker in ''[[The Language Instinct]]''), but this is not the case in many languages, including constructed languages such as Esperanto, where strict rules are in place as an attempt to consciously remove such irregularities. The possible exception to this are true native speakers of such languages.&lt;ref&gt;Proponents contend that there are 200–2000 [[native Esperanto speakers|native speakers of Esperanto]].&lt;/ref&gt; More substantive basis for this designation is that the vocabulary, grammar, and orthography of Interlingua are natural; they have been standardized and presented by a [[International Auxiliary Language Association|linguistic research body]], but they predated it and are not themselves considered a product of human invention.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Gode|Gode, Alexander]], ''[[Interlingua-English Dictionary|Interlingua-English: A dictionary of the international language]]''. New York: Storm Publishers, 1951. (Original edition)&lt;/ref&gt; Most experts, however, consider Interlingua to be naturalistic rather than natural.&lt;ref name="Gopsill, F. P. 1990"/&gt; [[Latino Sine Flexione]], a second naturalistic auxiliary language, is also naturalistic in content but is no longer widely spoken.&lt;ref&gt;Gopsill, F.

'''Norvegia''' ([[Latin]] for ''[[Norway]]'') is a [[phonetic]] [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] system which was developed by Norwegian [[linguist]] [[Johan Storm]] in 1884. Norvegia is still employed in the teaching of [[Scandinavian studies]] at Norwegian universities.

An '''opaque context''' or '''referentially opaque context''' is a [[context (language use)|linguistic context]] in which it is not always possible to substitute "co-referential" expressions (expressions referring to the same object) without altering the truth of sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Definition of "opaque context" {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|url = http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/opaque-context|website = www.collinsdictionary.com|accessdate = 2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The expressions involved are usually grammatically singular terms.  So, substitution of co-referential expressions into an opaque context does not always preserve truth. For example, "Lois believes x is a hero" is an opaque context because "Lois believes Superman is a hero" is true while "Lois believes Clark Kent is a hero" is false, even though 'Superman' and 'Clark Kent' are co-referential expressions.

==Usage==
The term is used in [[Philosophy|philosophical]] [[Sense and reference|theories of reference]], and is to be contrasted with "referentially transparent context".  In rough outline:

*Opacity: "Mary believes that [[Cicero]] is a great orator" gives rise to an opaque context; although Cicero was also called 'Tully', we can't simply substitute 'Tully' for 'Cicero' in this context ("Mary believes that Tully is a great orator") and guarantee the same truth value, for Mary might not know that the names 'Tully' and 'Cicero' refer to one and the same thing. Of course, if Mary does believe that Cicero is a great orator, then there is a sense in which Mary believes that Tully is a great orator, even if she does not know that 'Tully' and 'Cicero' ''corefer''. It is the sense forced on us by "direct reference" theories of proper names, i.e. those that maintain that the meaning of a proper name just is its referent.
*Transparency: "Cicero was a Roman orator" gives rise to a transparent context; there is no problem substituting 'Tully' for 'Cicero' here: "Tully was a Roman orator".  Both sentences necessarily express the same thing if 'Cicero' and 'Tully' refer to the same person.  Note that this element is missing in the opaque contexts, where a shift in the name can result in a sentence that expresses something different from the original.

Similar usage of the term applies for [[artificial language]]s such as [[programming language]]s and [[logic]]s.  The Cicero-Tully example above can be easily adapted.  Use the notation &lt;math&gt;[t]&lt;/math&gt; as a quotation that mentions a term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.  Define a predicate &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; to the effect that the letters making up a term number six.  Then &lt;math&gt;[x]&lt;/math&gt; induces an opaque context, or is '''referentially opaque''', because &lt;math&gt;L([Cicero])&lt;/math&gt; is true while &lt;math&gt;L([Tully])&lt;/math&gt; is false.  Programming languages often have richer semantics than logics' semantics of truth and falsity, and so an [[Operator (programming)|operator]] such as &lt;math&gt;[x]&lt;/math&gt; may fail to be referentially transparent for other reasons as well.

An '''outline''', also called a '''hierarchical outline''', is a list arranged to show [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] relationships and is a type of [[tree structure]].

It is not to be confused with the general context of the term "outline", which a summary or overview of a subject, presented verbally or written in prose&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]]: "outline ''n.''3.a. In ''pl.'' The main features or general principles of a subject, proposal, etc. 3.b. A brief verbal or written description of something, giving a general idea of the whole but leaving details to be filled in; a draft, a summary. Also: a précis of a proposed article, novel, scenario, etc."&lt;/ref&gt; (for example, ''[[The Outline of History]]'' is not an outline of the type presented below). The outlines described in this article are lists, and come in several varieties.

A sentence outline is a tool for composing a document, such as an essay, a paper, a book, or even an encyclopedia. It is a list used to organize the facts or points to be covered, and their order of presentation, by section. Topic outlines list the subtopics of a subject, arranged in levels, and while they can be used to plan a composition, they are most often used as a summary, such as in the form of a table of contents or the topic list in a college course's syllabus.

Outlines are further differentiated by the index prefixing used, or lack thereof.  Many outlines include a numerical or alphanumerical prefix preceding each entry in the outline, to provide a specific path for each item, to aid in referring to and discussing the entries listed. An alphanumerical outline uses alternating letters and numbers to identify entries. A decimal outline uses only numbers as prefixes. An outline without prefixes is called a "bare outline".

Specialized applications of outlines also exist. A reverse outline is a list of sentences or topics that is created from an existing work, as a revision tool; it may show the gaps in the document's coverage so that they may be filled, and may help in rearranging sentences or topics to improve the structure and flow of the work. An integrated outline is a composition tool for writing scholastic works, in which the sources, and the writer's notes from the sources, are integrated into the outline for ease of reference during the writing process.

A software program designed for processing outlines is called an [[outliner]].

== Types of outlines ==

Outlines are differentiated by style, the inclusion of prefixes, and specialized purpose. There are also hand-written outlines (which are highly limited in utility), and digitized outlines, such as those contained within an [[outliner]] (which are much more useful).

=== By style ===

There are two main styles of outline: sentence outlines and topic outlines.

==== A sample topic outline application: An outline of human knowledge ====

 
[[Propædia]] is the historical attempt of the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] to present a hierarchical "Outline of Knowledge" in a separate volume in the 15th edition of 1974. The ''[[Outline of Knowledge]]'' was a project by [[Mortimer Adler]]. Propædia had three levels, 10 "Parts" at the top level, 41 "Divisions" at the middle level and 167 "Sections" at the bottom level, numbered, for example, "1. Matter and Energy", "1.1 Atoms", "1.1.1. Structure and Properties of Atoms".

=== By prefixing used ===

A feature included in many outlines is prefixing. Similar to [[section numbers]], an outline prefix is a label (usually alphanumeric or numeric) placed at the beginning of an outline entry to assist in referring to it.

==== Bare outlines ====

Bare outlines include no prefixes.

==== Alphanumeric outline ====

An ''alphanumeric outline'' includes a prefix at the beginning of each topic as a reference aid. The prefix is in the form of [[Roman numerals]] for the top level, [[Letter case|upper-case]] letters (in the alphabet of the language being used) for the next level, [[Arabic numerals]] for the next level, and then lowercase letters for the next level.  For further levels, the order is started over again.  Each numeral or letter is followed by a period, and each item is capitalized, as in the following sample:

{{Quotation|
'''Thesis statement''': E-mail and [[Internet surveillance|internet monitoring]], as currently practiced, is an invasion of employees' rights in the workplace.

:I. The situation: Over 80% of today's companies monitor their employees.
::A. To prevent fraudulent activities, theft, and other workplace related violations.
::B. To more efficiently monitor employee productivity.
::C. To prevent any legal liabilities due to harassing or offensive communications.
:II. What are employees' privacy rights when it comes to electronic monitoring and surveillance in the workplace?
::A. American employees have basically no legal protection from mean and snooping bosses.
:::1. There are no federal or State laws protecting employees.
:::2. Employees may assert privacy protection for their own personal effects.
::B. Most managers believe that there is no right to privacy in the workplace.
:::1. Workplace communications should be about work; anything else is a misuse of company equipment and company time
:::2. Employers have a right to prevent misuse by monitoring employee communications
}}

Some call the Roman numerals "A-heads" (for "A-level headings"), the upper-case letters, "B-heads", and so on. Some writers also prefer to insert a blank line between the A-heads and B-heads, while often keeping the B-heads and C-heads together.

If more levels of outline are needed, lower-case Roman numerals and numbers and lower-case letters, sometimes with single and double parenthesis can be used, although the exact order is not well defined, and usage varies widely.

The scheme recommended by the ''[[MLA Handbook]]'',&lt;ref name="MLA 2009"&gt;{{cite book|title=MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers |year=2009 |publisher=Modern Language Association of America |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-1-60329-024-1 |author=&lt;!--Staff writers; no by-line.--&gt; |edition=Seventh |page=45 |chapter=1.8.3: Final Outline }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Purdue Online Writing Lab]]'',&lt;ref name="Purdue"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/544/03/ |title=Developing an Outline |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=[[Purdue Online Writing Lab]] |year=2011 |publisher=[[Purdue University]] |location= |accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others, uses the usual five levels, as described above, then repeats the Arabic numerals and lower-case letter surrounded by parentheses (round brackets)&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; I. A. 1. a. i. (1) (a)&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; and does not specify any lower levels,&lt;ref name="MLA 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Purdue" /&gt; though "(i)" is usually next.  In common practice, lower levels yet are usually Arabic numerals and lowercase letters again, and sometimes lower-case Roman again, with single parentheses &amp;ndash; 1) a) i)&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; but usage varies. MLA style is sometimes incorrectly referred to as APA style,&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{cite web |url= http://examples.yourdictionary.com/apa-outline-format-examples.html |title=APA Outline Format Examples |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=YourDictionary.com |year=2011 |accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the ''[[Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association|APA Publication Manual]]'' does not address outline formatting at all.

A very different style recommended by ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'',&lt;ref name="Chicago 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chicago 2003"&gt;{{cite book |title=Chicago Manual of Style |author=&lt;!--Staff writers; no by-line.--&gt; |edition=15th |pages=270&amp;ndash;275 |chapter=Lists and Outline Style (6.124&amp;ndash;130) |publisher=U. of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, IL |year=2003 |isbn=0-226-10403-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the practice of the [[United States Congress]] in drafting legislation, suggests the following sequence, from the top to the seventh level (the only ones specified):  I. A. 1. ''a'') (1) (''a'') ''i'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; capital Roman numerals with a period, capital letters with a period, Arabic numerals with a period, italic lowercase letters with a single parenthesis, Arabic numerals with a double parenthesis, italic lowercase letters with a double parenthesis, and italic lowercase Roman numerals with a single parentheses, though the italics are not required).  Because of its use in the [[United States Code|US Code]] and other US law books, Many American [[lawyers]] consequently use this outline format.

Another alternative scheme repeats all five levels with a single parenthesis for the second five &amp;ndash; I) A) 1) a) i)&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; and then again with a double parenthesis for the third five&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; (I) (A) (1) (a) (i).{{citation needed|date=October 2011|reason=Not used in any source cited so far.}}

Many oft-cited style guides besides the ''APA Publication Manual'', including the ''[[Associated Press Stylebook|AP Stylebook]]'', the ''[[New York Times Manual|NYT Manual]]'', [[Fowler's Modern English Usage|Fowler]], ''[[The Guardian]]'' Style Guide, and [[The Elements of Style|Strunk &amp; White]], are curiously silent on the topic.

One side effect of the use of both Roman numerals and uppercase letters in all of these styles of outlining is that in most alphabets, "I." may be an item at both the top (A-head) and second (B-head) levels. This is usually not problematic because lower level items are usually referred to hierarchically. For example, the third sub-sub-item of the fourth sub-item of the second item is item II. D. 3.  So, the ninth sub-item (letter-I) of the first item (Roman-I) is item I. I., and only the top level one is item I.

==== Decimal outline ====

The ''decimal outline'' format has the advantage of showing how every item at every level relates to the whole, as shown in the following sample outline:

{{Quotation|
'''Thesis statement''': ---

:1.0 Introduction
::1.1 Brief history of Liz Claiborne
::1.2 Corporate environment
:2.0 Career opportunities
::2.1 Operations management
:::2.1.1 Traffic
:::2.1.2 International trade and corporate customs
:::2.1.3 Distribution
::2.2 Product development
}}

=== By specialized purpose ===

Special types of outlines include reverse outlines and integrated outlines.

==== Reverse outline ====

A ''reverse outline'' is an outline made from an existing work. Reverse outlining is like reverse engineering a document. The points or topics are extracted from the work, and are arranged in their order of presentation, by section, in the outline. Once completed, the outline can be filled in and rearranged as a plan for a new improved version of the document.

==== Integrated outline ====

An ''integrated outline'' is a helpful step in the process of organizing and writing a scholarly paper ([[literature review]], [[research]] paper, [[thesis]] or [[dissertation]]). When completed the integrated outline contains the relevant scholarly sources (author's last name, publication year, page number if quote) for each section in the outline. An integrated outline is generally prepared after the scholar has collected, read and mastered the literature that will be used in the research paper. Shields and Rangarajan (2013) recommend that new scholars develop a system to do this. Part of the system should contain a systematic way to take notes on the scholarly sources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patricia M. Shields|Shields, Patricia]] and Rangarjan, N. 2013. ''A Playbook for Research Methods: Integrating Conceptual Frameworks and Project Management''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=tVYbAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Patricia+M.+Shields%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=c3iIU6X7HdOYyASjlIDwBw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]. Stillwater, OK: New Forums Press. See Chapter 8 for a detailed discussion of an integrated outline with examples.&lt;/ref&gt; These notes can then be tied to the paper through the integrated outline. This way the scholar reviews all of the literature before the writing begins.

An integrated outline can be a helpful tool for people with [[writer's block]] because the content of the paper is organized and identified prior to writing. The structure and content is combined and the author can write a small section at a time. The process is less overwhelming because it can be separated into manageable chunks. The first draft can be written using smaller blocks of time.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Patricia. 2014. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263861162_Tools_for_Writing_Excellent_Papers_2014_ASPA_Student_Summit Tools for Excellent Papers]: 2014 ASPA Student Summit. Presentation at the [[American Society for Public Administration]] annual conference, Washington DC March 15, This powerpoint describes a system for writing paper that contains an integrated outline. Slides 37 - 46 examine the components of an integrated outline with an example.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hand-written vs computerized ===

For a comparison, see [[#Outliners|Outliners]], below.

== Applications ==

Outlines are used for composition, summarization, and as a development and storage medium.

=== Composition ===

''Merriam-Webster's manual for writers and editors'' (1998, p.&amp;nbsp;290) recommends that the section headings of an article should when read in isolation, combine to form an outline of the article content. Garson (2002) distinguishes a 'standard outline', presented as a regular [[table of contents]] from a refined tree-like 'hierarchical outline', stating that "such an outline might be appropriate, for instance, when the purpose is taxonomic (placing observed phenomena into an exhaustive set of categories). ... hierarchical outlines are rare in quantitative writing, and the researcher is well advised to stick to the standard outline unless there are compelling reasons not to."&lt;ref&gt;G. David Garson, ''Guide to writing empirical papers, theses, and dissertations''. CRC Press, 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-8247-0605-0}}, chapter "Typical Outlines", pp. 23-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers of [[fiction]] and [[creative nonfiction]], such as Jon Franklin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title =Writing for Story|date = 1994|last = Franklin|first = Jonathan|publisher = Plume|isbn = 9780452272958}}&lt;/ref&gt; may use outlines to establish plot sequence, character development and dramatic flow of a story, sometimes in conjunction with [[free writing]].

Preparation of an outline is an intermediate step in the process of writing a scholarly [[research]] paper, [[literature review]], [[thesis]] or [[dissertation]]. A special kind of outline (integrated outline) incorporates scholarly sources into the outline before the writing begins.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Patricia M. 2004.[http://store.newforums.com/STEP-by-STEP-Building-a-Research-Paper-SWB01.htm ''Step by Step: Building a Research Paper.''] Stillwater OK: New Forums Press. {{ISBN|1-58107-117-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Summarization ===

In addition to being used as a composition tool during the drafting process, outlines can also be used as a publishing format. Outlines can presented as work's table of contents, but they can also be used as the body of a work.  The ''[[Outline of Knowledge]]'' from the 15th edition of the ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' is an example of this. Wikipedia includes outlines that summarize subjects (for example, see [[Outline of chess]], [[Outline of Mars]], and [[Outline of knowledge]]).

Professors often hand out to their students at the beginning of a term, a summary of the subjects to be covered throughout the course in the form of a topic outline. It may also be included as part of a larger course synopsis.

Outlines are also used to summarize talking points for a speech or lecture.

=== Personal information management ===

Outlines, especially those used within an [[outliner]], can be used for planning, scheduling, and recording.

== Outliners ==
{{Main|Outliner}}

An [[outliner]] (or "outline processor") is a specialized type of [[word processor]] used to view, create, build, modify, and maintain outlines. It is a computer program, or part of one, used for displaying, organizing, and editing [[hierarchy|hierarchically]] arranged text in an outline's [[tree structure]]. Textual information is contained in discrete sections called "nodes", which are arranged according to their topic-subtopic (parent-child) relationships, sort of like the members of a [[family tree]]. When loaded into an outliner, an outline may be [[text folding|collapsed or expanded]] to display as few or as many levels as desired.

Outliners are used for storing and retrieving textual information, with terms, phrases, sentences, or paragraphs attached to a tree.  So rather than being arranged by document, information is arranged by topic or content. An outline in an outliner may contain as many topics as desired.  This eliminates the need to have separate documents, as outlines easily include other outlines just by adding to the tree.

The main difference between a hand-written outline and a digital one, is that the former is usually limited to a summary or blueprint of a planned document, while the latter may easily include all of the content of the entire document and many more.  In other words, as a hand-written work an outline is a writing tool, but on a computer, it is a general purpose format supported by a robust development and display medium capable of handling knowledge from its creation to its end use.

Outliners may be used in [[content creation]] instead of general word processors for capturing, organizing, editing, and displaying knowledge or general textual information. Outliners are ideal for managing lists, organizing facts and ideas, and for [[computer programming|writing computer programs]].  They are also used for goal and task management (including [[personal information management]] and [[project management]]), and for writing books and movie scripts.

The graphical counterpart to outliners are [[mind mapper]]s.

'''Palmyrene''' or '''Palmyrenean''' was a [[Western Aramaic languages|Western Aramaic]] dialect  spoken in the city of [[Palmyra]], [[Syria]], in the early centuries AD. The development of cursive versions of Aramaic led to the creation of the [[Palmyrene alphabet]].

Other West Aramaic dialects include [[Nabataean]]  and [[Judeo-Aramaic]]. West Aramaic dialects continue to be spoken in three villages in [[Syria]]: [[Maaloula]], [[Bakh`a]] and [[Jubb`adin]].

'''Polyglotism''' or '''polyglottism'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/polyglottism|title=Definition of "polyglot" - Collins English Dictionary|author=|date=|work=collinsdictionary.com|accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is knowledge of several [[language]]s, consisting of the ability to understand, speak, read, or write these languages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=polyglot ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/polyglot ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/polyglot ]&lt;/ref&gt; The word is a synonym of [[multilingualism]], but in recent usage polyglot is sometimes used to refer to a person who learns multiple languages as an [[avocation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Krzeminska|first=Marta|url=http://www.latg.org/2016/07/the-cult-polyglot.html/|title=The cult of the polyglot|date=19 July 2016|accessdate=7 September 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160906123938/http://www.latg.org/2016/07/the-cult-polyglot.html/|archivedate=6 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Erard"&gt;{{cite book|last=Erard|first=Michael|year=2012|title=Babel No More: The Search for the World’s Most Extraordinary Language Learners|publisher=Free Press|isbn=978-1-4516-2825-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "hyperpolyglot" was coined in 2008 by linguist [[Richard Hudson (linguist)|Richard Hudson]] to describe individuals who speak—to some degree—dozens of languages.&lt;ref name="Hudson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hudson|first=Richard|chapter=Word grammar, cognitive linguistics, and second language learning and teaching|editor=Peter Robinson|editor2=Nick Ellis|title=Handbook of Cognitive Linguistics and Second Language Acquisition|location=New York|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|isbn=9780805853513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multilingualism, including multilingual societies as well as individuals who speak more than one language, is common. Individual polyglots or hyperpolyglots speak, study, or use large numbers of languages. In rare cases, polyglot savants have mental disabilities, but are able to learn many languages.

== Multilingual societies ==
{{main|Multilingualism}}
Most [[nation state]]s are home to multiple [[ethnic group]]s and multiple [[language]]s, and most of the world's population is bilingual or multilingual. In other words, only a minority of the world's peoples are monolingual&lt;ref name="LSA"&gt;{{cite web|last=Valdés|first=Guadalupe|title=Multilingualism|url=http://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/multilingualism|website=Linguistic Society of America|year=2012|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Informal surveys suggest that the number of languages spoken in multilingual societies is typically between two and six languages.&lt;ref name="Hudson"/&gt; However, there is a lack of consensus on such numbers due to the lack of shared definitions of multilingualism and the difficulty of differentiating among [[Variety (linguistics)|language varieties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cook|first=Vivian|title=Second Language Learning and Language Teaching|year=2008|publisher=Hodder Education|isbn=978-0-340-95876-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Polyglots and hyperpolyglots ==
{{further|List of polyglots}}
Some individuals speak, study, or otherwise use large numbers of languages. One notable hyperpolyglot was Cardinal [[Giuseppe Caspar Mezzofanti]], an Italian priest reputed to have spoken anywhere from 30 to 72 languages.&lt;ref name="Erard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hudson"/&gt; Individuals who consider themselves polyglots generally speak, read, or otherwise use five or more languages. In some cases, the number can be as high as several dozen.

Many polyglots and hyperpolyglots become multilingual by [[Second-language acquisition|studying languages]].&lt;ref name="Erard"/&gt; [[Language proficiency]] and learning success vary among individuals. [[Neuroscience of multilingualism]] points to possible differences among learners. One theory suggests that a spike in a baby's testosterone levels while in the uterus can increase brain asymmetry, which may relate to music and language ability, among other effects.&lt;ref name="Leland"&gt;{{cite news|last=Leland|first=John|authorlink=John Leland (journalist)|title=Adventures of a Teenage Polyglot|work=The New York Times|date=9 March 2012|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/nyregion/a-teenage-master-of-languages-finds-online-fellowship.html?_r=1|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Study and motivation also affect learning. People learning multiple languages may optimize their learning strategies, making it easier to learn subsequent languages. They may also experience [[Language transfer|positive transfer]] – the process by which it becomes easier to learn additional languages if the [[grammar]] or [[vocabulary]] of the new language is similar to those of languages already spoken. On the other hand, students may also experience negative transfer – interference from languages learned at an earlier stage of development while learning a new language later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pavlenko|first=Aneta|title=Can a second language help you learn a third?|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/life-bilingual/201506/can-second-language-help-you-learn-third|website=Psychology Today: Life as a Bilingual|date=2 June 2015|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Association of Hyperpolyglots represents those with demonstrable hyperpolyglotic language proficiency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://polyglotassociation.org International Association of Hyperpolyglots] Organisational Profile. Accessed 7 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=April 2017}}

Hyperpolyglots speak a larger number of languages and tend to show an above average ability to learn and speak languages. Linguistic expert [[Michael Erard]] says that while there are many polyglots who know six languages, the number drops off above this number. Based on the numbers, he says that when people know eleven languages fluently, it puts them in the hyperpolyglot category.&lt;ref&gt;Steinmetz, Katy http://healthland.time.com/2012/01/30/are-you-a-hyperpolyglot-the-secrets-of-language-superlearners/ Are You A Hyperpolyglot: the secrets of language superlearners], ''Time''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Polyglot savant syndrome ==
While the term "savant" generally refers to an individual with a natural and/or innate talent for a particular field, people diagnosed with [[savant syndrome]] are typically individuals with significant mental disabilities who demonstrate profound and [[Child prodigy|prodigious]] capacities and/or abilities far in excess of what would be considered normal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=9990844|year=1999|last1=Miller|first1=LK|title=The savant syndrome: Intellectual impairment and exceptional skill|volume=125|issue=1|pages=31–46|journal=Psychological Bulletin|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.125.1.31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2003.11.002|title=Comparing the intelligence profiles of savant and nonsavant individuals with autistic disorder|year=2004|last1=Bolte|first1=S|journal=Intelligence|volume=32|issue=2|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; occasionally including the capacity for languages. The condition is associated with an increased memory capacity, which would aid in the storage and retrieval of knowledge of a language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Treffert|first=Darold A.|date=2009-05-27|title=The savant syndrome: an extraordinary condition. A synopsis: past, present, future|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=364|issue=1522|pages=1351–1357|doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0326|issn=0962-8436|pmc=2677584|pmid=19528017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, for example, [[Neil Smith (linguist)|Neil Smith]] and Ianthi-Maria Tsimpli described Christopher, a man with non-verbal [[IQ]] scores between 40 and 70, who learned sixteen languages. Christopher was born in 1962 and approximately six months after his birth was diagnosed with brain damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bates|first=Elizabeth|date=1997|title=On language savants and the structure of the mind|url=https://crl.ucsd.edu/bates/papers/pdf/langsav.pdf|journal=International Journal of Bilingualism|pages=163–179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being institutionalized because he was unable to take care of himself, Christopher had a verbal IQ of 89, was able to speak English with no impairment, and could learn subsequent languages with apparent ease. This facility with language and communication is considered unusual among savants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Neil|last2=Tsimpli|first2=Ianthi-Maria|title=Linguistic modularity?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2400">In the [[social science|social sciences]] and [[philosophy]], a '''positive''' or '''descriptive statement''' concerns what "is", "was", or "will be", and contains no indication of approval or disapproval (what should be). Positive statements are thus the opposite of [[normative statement|normative statements]]. Positive statement is based on empirical evidence. For examples, "An increase in taxation will result in less consumption" and "A fall in supply of petrol will lead to an increase in its price". However, positive statement can be factually incorrect: "The moon is made of green cheese" is empirically false, but is still a positive statement, as it is a statement about what is, not what should be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Positive and normative economics|website=http://www.soas.ac.uk/cedep-demos/000_P570_IEEP_K3736-Demo/unit1/page_16.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Positive statements and normative  statements ==
Positive statements are distinct from normative statements. Positive statements are based on empirical evidence, can be tested, and involve no value judgements. Positive statements refer to '''what is''' and contain no indication of approval or disapproval. When values or opinions come into the analysis, then it is in the realm of normative economics. A '''normative''' statement expresses a judgment about whether a situation is desirable or undesirable, which can carry value judgements. These refer to '''what ought to be.'''

== Use of positive statement ==
Positive statements are widely used to describe something measurable, like the rate of  inflation in an economy. They are mainly used in explanations of theories and concepts. Using a positive statement does not mean you can't have your own opinions on issues. However, when you are writing academic essays it's important to use positive statements to support an argument, since it can be verified by evidence.

'''''Salva congruitate'''''&lt;ref&gt;[[W.V.O. Quine]], ''Philosophy of logic''&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Latin]] scholastic term in [[logic]], which means "without becoming ill-formed",&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Benjamin Schnieder, Canonical Property Designators, P9&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[wikt:salvus|salva]]'' meaning ''rescue'', ''salvation'', ''welfare'' and ''[[wikt:congruo|congruitate]]'' meaning ''combine'', ''coincide'', ''agree''. Salva Congruitate is used in logic to mean that two terms may be [[Substitution (logic)|substituted]] for each other while preserving [[grammar|grammaticality]] in all contexts.&lt;ref&gt;W.V.O. Quine, Quiddities, P204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.V.O. Quine, Philosophy of Logic, P18&lt;/ref&gt;

== Remarks on ''salva congruitate'' ==

=== Timothy C. Potts ===

[[Timothy C. Potts]] describes ''salva congruitate'' as a form of replacement in the context of meaning. It is a replacement which preserves [[semantic]] coherence and should be distinguished from a replacement which preserves [[Syntax|syntactic]] coherence but may yield an expression to which no [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]] has been given. This means that supposing an original expression is meaningful, the new expression obtained by the replacement will also be meaningful, though it will not necessarily have the same meaning as the original one, nor, if the expression in question happens to be a [[proposition]], will the replacement necessarily preserve the truth value of the original.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy C. Potts, ''Structures and categories for the representation of meaning'', p57&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bob Hale ===

[[Bob Hale (philosopher)|Bob Hale]] explains ''salva congruitate'', as applied to singular terms, as [[Noun|substantival]] expressions in natural language, which are able to replace singular terms without destructive effect on the [[Syntax|grammar]] of a sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Hale, Singular Terms, P34&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the singular term 'Bob' may be replaced by the definite description 'the first man to swim the English Channel' ''salva congruitate''. Such replacement may shift both meaning and reference, and so, if made in the context of a sentence, may cause a change in truth-value. Thus terms which may be interchanged ''salva congruitate'' may not be interchangeable ''salva veritate'' (preserving truth). More generally, expressions of any type are interchangeable ''salva congruitate'' if and only if they can replace one another preserving grammaticality or well-formedness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54392">Every day, people are presented with endless amounts of information, and in an effort to help keep track and organize this information, people must be able to recognize, differentiate and store information. One way to do that is to [[information organization|organize information]] as it pertains to the self.&lt;ref name="source1"&gt;Rogers, T. B., Kuiper, N. A., &amp; Kirker, W. S. (1977). Self-reference and the encoding of personal information. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 35''(9), 677-688. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.35.9.677&lt;/ref&gt; The overall concept of [[self-reference]] suggests that people interpret incoming information in relation to themselves, using their [[self-concept]] as a background for new information.&lt;ref name = "source1" /&gt;  Examples include being able to attribute [[personality traits]] to oneself or to identify [[recollection|recollected]] episodes as being personal memories of the past.&lt;ref name="source6"&gt;Benoit, R. G., Gilbert, S. J., Volle, E., &amp; Burgess, P. W. (2010). When I think about me and simulate you: Medial rostral prefrontal cortex and self-referential processes. ''Neuroimage, 50''(3), 1340-1349. doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.12.091&lt;/ref&gt; The implications of self-referential processing are evident in many psychological phenomena. For example, the "[[cocktail party effect]]" notes that people attend to the sound of their names even during other conversation or more prominent, distracting noise. Also, people tend to evaluate things related to themselves more positively (This is thought to be an aspect of [[implicit self-esteem]]). For example, people tend to prefer their [[Implicit self-esteem#Name.E2.80.93letter effect|own initials]] over other letters.&lt;ref name="source8"&gt;Heatherton, T. F., Macrae, C., &amp; Kelley, W. M. (2004). What the social brain sciences can tell us about the self. ''Current Directions in Psychological Science, 13''(5), 190-193. doi:10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00305.x&lt;/ref&gt; The [[self-reference effect]] (SRE) has received the most attention through investigations into memory. The concepts of '''self-referential encoding''' and the SRE rely on the notion that relating information to the self during the process of encoding it in memory facilitates recall, hence the effect of self-reference on memory. In essence, researchers have investigated the potential [[mnemonic]] properties of self-reference.&lt;ref name="source5"&gt;Klein, S. B., Loftus, J., &amp; Burton, H. A. (1989). Two self-reference effects: The importance of distinguishing between self-descriptiveness judgments and autobiographical retrieval in self-referent encoding. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 56''(6), 853-865. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.56.6.853&lt;/ref&gt;

Research includes investigations into [[self-schema]], [[self-concept]] and [[self-awareness]] as providing the foundation for self-reference's role in [[memory]]. Multiple explanations for the self-reference effect in memory exist, leading to a debate about the underlying processes involved in the self-reference effect. In addition, through the exploration of the self-reference effect, other psychological concepts have been discovered or supported, including [[#Simulation theory|simulation theory]] and the [[#Expansion of the SRE: group reference|group reference]] effect.
After researchers developed a concrete understanding of the self-reference effect, many expanded their investigations to consider the self-reference effect in particular groups like those with [[#Autism spectrum disorder|autism spectrum disorder]]s or those experiencing [[#Depression|depression]].

==Self-concept and self-schema==
Self-knowledge can be categorized by structures in memory or [[Schema (psychology)|schemata]]. A [[self-schema]] is a set of facts or beliefs that one has about themselves.&lt;ref name="source14"&gt;Katz, A. N. (1987). Self-reference in the encoding of creative-relevant traits. ''Journal of Personality, 55''(1), 97-120. doi:10.1111/j.1467-6494.1987.tb00430.x&lt;/ref&gt; For any given trait, an individual may or may not be "schematic"; that is, the individual may or may not think about themselves as to where they stand on that trait. For example, people who think of themselves as very overweight or who identify themselves to a greater extent based on their body weight would be considered "schematic" on the attribute of body weight. Thus, many everyday events, such as going out for a meal or discussing a friend's eating habits, could induce thoughts about the self.&lt;ref&gt;Markus, H., Hamill, R., &amp; Sentis, K. P. (1987). Thinking fat: Self-schemas for body weight and the processing of weight relevant information. ''Journal of Applied Social Psychology'', ''17''(1), 50-71. doi:10.1111/j.1559-1816.1987.tb00292.x&lt;/ref&gt; When people relate information to something that has to do with the self, it facilitates memory.&lt;ref name = "source15"&gt;Klein, S. B., Loftus, J., &amp; Burton, H. A. (1989). Two self-reference effects: The importance of distinguishing between self-descriptiveness judgments and autobiographical retrieval in self-referent encoding. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 56(6), 853-865. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.56.6.8533&lt;/ref&gt; Self-descriptive adjectives that fit into one's self-schema are easier to remember than adjectives not viewed as related to the self. Thus, the self-schema is an aspect of oneself that is used as an encoding structure that brings upon memory of information consistent with one's self-schema.&lt;ref name="source16"&gt;Mills, C. J. (1983). Sex-typing and self-schemata effects on memory and response latency. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 45''(1), 163-172. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.45.1.163&lt;/ref&gt; Memories that are elaborate and well encoded are usually the result of self-referent correlations during the process of remembering. During the process of encoding, trait representations are encoded in long term memory either directly or indirectly. When they are directly encoded, it is in terms of relating to the self, and when it is indirectly encoded it is done through spouts of episodic information instead of information about the self.&lt;ref name = "source14"/&gt;

Self-schema is often used as somewhat of a database for encoding personal data.&lt;ref name = "source13"/&gt; The self-schema is also used by paying selective attention to outside information and internalizing that information more deeply in one's memory depending on how much that information relates to their schema.&lt;ref name = "source12"/&gt; When self-schema is engaged, traits that go along with one's view of themselves are better remembered and [[Recall (memory)|recalled]].  These traits are also often recalled much better when processed with respect to the self. Similarly, items that are encoded with the self are based on one's self-schema.&lt;ref name = "source5"/&gt; Processing the information should balance out when recalled for individuals who have a self-schema that goes along with the information.&lt;ref name = "source16"/&gt;

Self-schemas do not necessarily only involve individual traits. People self-categorize at different levels that range from more personal to more social. Self-schemas have three main categories which play a role: the personal self, the relational self, and the collective self. The personal self deals with individual level characteristics, the relational self deals with intimate relationship partners, and the collective self deals with group identities, relating to self-important social groups to which one belongs (e.g., one's family or university).&lt;ref name="source31"&gt;Johnson, C., Gadon, O., Carlson, D., Southwick, S., Faith, M., &amp; Chalfin, J. (2002). Self-reference and group membership: Evidence for a group-reference effect. ''European Journal of Social Psychology, 32''(2), 261-274. doi:10.1002/ejsp.83&lt;/ref&gt; Information that is related to any type of self-schema, including group-related knowledge structures facilitates memory.

In order for the self to be an effective encoding mechanism, it must be a uniform, consistent, well-developed schema. It has been shown that identity exploration leads to the development of self-knowledge which facilitates self-judgments. Identity exploration led to shorter decision times, higher confidence ratings and more intrusions in memory tasks.&lt;ref name="ego"&gt;Dunkel, C. S. (2005). Ego-identity and the Processing of Self-relevant Information . Self and Identity, 349-359&lt;/ref&gt; Previous researchers hypothesized that words compatible with a person's self-schema are easily accessible in memory and are more likely than incompatible words to intrude on a schema-irrelevant memory task. In one experiment, when participants were asked to decide if certain adjectives were "like me" or "not like me," they made the decisions faster when the words were compatible with their self-schema.&lt;ref name="behavior"&gt;&lt;div&gt;Strube, M., Berry, J. M., Lott, C., Fogelman, R., Steinhart, G., Moergen, S., &amp; Davison, L. (1986). Self-schematic representation of the Type A and B behavior patterns. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', ''51''(1), 170-180. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.51.1.170&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

However, despite the existence of the self-reference effect when considering schemata consistent adjectives, the connection between the self and memory can lead to a larger number of mistakes in recognition, commonly referred to as false alarms. Rogers et al. (1979) found that people are more likely to falsely recognize adjectives they had previously designated to be self-descriptive.&lt;ref name = "ego"/&gt; Expanding on this, Strube et al. (1986) found that false alarms occurred more for self-schema consistent content, presumably because the presence of such words in the schema makes them more accessible in memory.&lt;ref name = "behavior"/&gt;

In addition to investigating the self-reference effect in regards to schemata consistent information, Strube et al. discussed how counter schemata information relates to this framework. They noted that the pattern of making correct decisions more rapidly did not hold when considering words that countered a person's self-schema, presumably because they were difficult to integrate into memory due to lack of a preexisting structure.&lt;ref name = "behavior"/&gt; That is, they lacked the organizational structure of encoding because they did not fall into the "like me" category, and elaboration would not work because prior connections to the adjective did not exist.

===Self-awareness and personality===
Two of the most common functions of the self receiving significant attention in research are the self-acting to organize the individual's understanding of the social environment, and the self functioning to regulate behavior through self-evaluation.&lt;ref name="hull"&gt;Hull, J. G., &amp; Levy, A. S. (1979). The organizational functions of the self: An alternative to the Duval and Wicklund Model of self-awareness. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 37''(5), 756-768. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.37.5.756&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of self-awareness is considered to be the foundational principle for both functions of the self. Some research presents self-awareness in terms of self-focused attention &lt;ref&gt;Duval, S., &amp; Wicklund, R. A. (1972). ''A theory of objective self-awareness.'' New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Hull and Levy suggest that self-awareness refers to the encoding of information based on its relevance to the self.&lt;ref name = "hull"/&gt; Based on the latter interpretation of self-awareness, individuals must identify the aspects of situations that are relevant to themselves and their behavior will be shaped accordingly.&lt;ref name = "hull"/&gt; Hull and Levy suggest that self-awareness corresponds to the encoding of information cued by self-symbolic stimuli, and examine the idea of self-awareness as a method of encoding. They structured an investigation that examined self-referent encoding in individuals with different levels of self-awareness, predicting that individuals with higher levels of self-consciousness would encode self-relevant information more deeply than other information, and that they would encode it more deeply than individuals with low levels of self-consciousness.&lt;ref name = "hull"/&gt; The results of their investigation supported their hypothesis that self-focused attention is not enough to explain the role of self-awareness on attribution. Their results suggest that self-awareness leads to increased sensitivity to the situationally defined meanings of behavior, and therefore organizes the individual's understanding of the social environment.&lt;ref name = "hull"/&gt; The research presented by Hull and Levy led to future research on the encoding of information associated with self-awareness.

In later research, Hull and colleagues examined the associations between self-referential encoding, self-consciousness and the extent to which a stimulus is consistent with self-knowledge. They first assumed that the encoding of a stimulus is facilitated if an individual's working memory already contains information consistent with the stimulus, and suggested that self-consciousness as an encoding mechanism relies on an individual's self-knowledge.&lt;ref name="review"&gt;Hull, J. G., Van Treuren, R. R., Ashford, S. J., Propsom, P., &amp; Andrus, B. W. (1988). Self-consciousness and the processing of self-relevant information. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 54''(3), 452-465. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.54.3.452&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that situational and dispositional factors may activate certain pools of knowledge, moving them into working memory, and guiding the processing of certain stimulus information.&lt;ref name = "review"/&gt;

In order to better understand the idea of activating information in memory, Hull et al. presented an example of how information is activated. They referred to the sentence "The robber took the money from the bank".&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J. R. (1983). ''The architecture of cognition.'' Cambridge. MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In English, the word bank has two applicable meanings in the context of this sentence (monetary institution and river shore). However, the monetary institution meaning of the word is more highly activated in this context due to the addition of the words robber and money to the sentence, because they are associatively relevant and therefore pull the monetary institution definition for bank into working memory.  Once information is added to working memory, meanings and associations are more easily drawn. Therefore, the meaning of this example sentence is almost universally understood.&lt;ref name = "review"/&gt;

In reference to self-consciousness and self-reference, the connection between self-consciousness and self-referent encoding relies on such information activation. Research suggests that self-consciousness activates knowledge relating to the self, thereby guiding the processing of self-relevant information.&lt;ref name = "review"/&gt; Three experiments conducted by Hull and colleagues provided evidence that a manipulation of accessible self-knowledge impacts self-referent encoding based on the self-relevance of such information, individual differences in the accessibility of self-knowledge (self-consciousness) impacts perception, and a mediation relationship exists between self-consciousness and individual differences in self-referential encoding.&lt;ref name = "review"/&gt;

Similar to how self-awareness impacts the availability of self-knowledge and the encoding of self-relevant information, through the development of the self-schema, people develop and maintain certain personality characteristics leading to a variety of behavior patterns. Research has been done on the differences between [[Type A and Type B personality theory|Type A and Type B behavior patterns]], focusing on how people in each group respond to environmental information and their interpretation of the performance of others and themselves. It has been found that Type A behavior is characterized by competitive achievement striving, time urgency and hostility, whereas Type B is usually defined as an absence of Type A characteristics. When investigating causal attributions for hypothetical positive and negative outcomes, Strube et al. found that Type A individuals were more self-serving, in that they took greater responsibility for positive than negative effects. Strube and colleagues argued that this could be a result of the fact that schema-consistent information is more easily remembered and the ease with which past successes and failures are recalled, determined by self-schema, would impact attributions. It is reasonable to believe that Type A's might recall successes more easily and hence be more self-serving.&lt;ref name = "behavior"/&gt;

==Theoretical background==
Influential psychologists [[Fergus Craik|Craik]] and Lockhart laid the groundwork for research focused on self-referential encoding and memory. In 1972 they proposed their Depth of Processing framework which suggests that memory retention depends on how the stimulus material was encoded in memory.&lt;ref&gt;Craik, F. I. M., &amp; Lockhart, R. S. (1972).'' ''Levels of processing: A framework for memory research. ''Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 11''(6), 671-684. [[doi:10.1016/S0022-5371(72)80001-X|doi: 10.1016/S0022-5371(72)80001-X]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="source2"&gt;Klein, S. B., &amp; Kihlstrom, J. F. (1986). Elaboration, organization, and the self-reference effect in memory. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 115''(1), 26-38. doi:10.1037/0096-3445.115.1.26&lt;/ref&gt; Their original research considered structural, phonemic, and [[Semantic memory|semantic]] encoding tasks, and showed that semantic encoding is the best method to aid in recall. They asked participants to rate 40 descriptive [[adjectives]] on one of four tasks; Structural (Big font or small font?), Phonemic (Rhymes with xxx?), Semantic (Means same as xxx?), or Self-reference (Describes you?). This was then followed by an "incidental recall task". This is where participants are asked, without prior warning, to recall as many of the words they had seen as possible within a given time limit. Craik and Tulving's original experiment showed that structural and [[phonemic]] tasks lead only to "shallow" encoding, while the semantic tasks lead to "deep" encoding and resulted in better recall.&lt;ref&gt;Craik F., &amp; Tulving, E. (1975). Depth of processing and the retention of words in episodic memory. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 104,'' 268-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 1977, it was shown that self-relevant or self-descriptive encoding leads to even better recall than semantic tasks.&lt;ref name = "source2"/&gt; Experts suggest that the call on [[Association (psychology)|associative]] [[memory]] required by semantic tasks is what provides the advantage over structural or phonemic tasks, but is not enough to surpass the benefit provided by self-referential encoding.&lt;ref name = "source1"/&gt; The fact that self-reference was shown to be a stronger memory encoding method than semantic tasks is what led to more significant interest in the field &lt;ref name = "source5"/&gt; One early and significant experiment aimed to place self-reference on Craik and Lockhart's depth of processing hierarchy, and suggested that self-reference was a more beneficial encoding method than semantic tasks. In this experiment, participants filled out self-ratings on 84 adjectives. Months later, these participants were revisited and were randomly shown 42 of those words. They then had to select the group of 42 "revisited" words out of the total original list. The researchers argued that if the "self" was involved in memory retrieval, participants would incorrectly recognize words that were more self-descriptive &lt;ref name = "source1"/&gt; In another experiment, subjects answered yes or no to cue questions about 40 adjective in 4 tasks (structural, phonemic, semantic and self-referential) and later had to recall the adjectives. This experiment validated the strength of self-reference as an encoding method, and indicated it developed a stronger memory trace than the semantic task.&lt;ref name = "source1"/&gt;

Researchers are implementing a new strategy by developing different encoding tasks that enhance memory very similarly to self-referential encoding.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt;  Symons (1990) had findings that went against the norm when he was unable to find evidence of self-schematicity in the self-reference effect.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt;  Another finding was that when referencing gender and religion, there was a low memory recall when compared with referencing the self. A [[meta-analysis]] by Symons and Johnson (1997) showed self-reference resulting in better memory in comparison to tasks relying on [[Semantic memory|semantic]] encoding or other-referent encoding. According to Symons and Johnson, self-referencing questions elicit elaboration and organization in memory, both of which creating a deeper encoding and thus facilitate memory.&lt;ref name="source4" /&gt;

Theorists that favor the view that the self has a special role believe that the self leads to more in depth processing, leading to easier recall during self-reference tasks.&lt;ref name = "source5"/&gt; Theorists also promote the self-schema as being one of the sole inhibitors that allow for recall from deep memory.&lt;ref name = "source13"/&gt; Thorndyke and Hayes-Roth had the goal of focusing on the process made by the active memory schemata.&lt;ref&gt;Thorndyke, P. W., &amp; Hayes-Roth, B. (1979). The use schemata in the acquisition and transfer of knowledge.'' Cognitive Psychology, 11''(1), 82-106. [[doi: 10.1016/0010-0285(79)90005-7]]&lt;/ref&gt; Sex-typed individuals recall trait adjectives that go along with their sex role more quickly than trait adjectives that are not. During the process of free recall, these individuals also showed more patterns for gender clustering than other sexually typed individuals.&lt;ref name="source16" /&gt;

==Types of self-referential encoding tasks==
As research on self-referential encoding became more prolific, some psychologists took an opportunity to delineate specific self-referential encoding tasks. It is noted that descriptive tasks are those that require participants to determine if a stimulus word can be classified as "self-descriptive." Autobiographical tasks are those that require participants to use the stimulus word as a cue to recall an autobiographical memory. Results from experiments that differentiated between these types of self-referential encoding found that they both produced better recall than semantic tasks, and neither was more advantageous than the other. However, research does suggest that the two types of self-referential encoding do rely on different processes to facilitate memory.&lt;ref name = "source5"/&gt; In most experiments discussed, these types of self- referential encoding were not differentiated.

In a typical self-reference task, adjectives are presented and classified as either self-descriptive or not.&lt;ref name = "source5"/&gt; For example, in a study by Dobson and Shaw, adjectives about the self that were preselected were given to the participants and they decide whether or not the adjectives are self-descriptive.&lt;ref name="source12" /&gt;  The basis for making certain judgments, decisions, inferences and decisions is a self-referent encoding task. If two items are classified as self-descriptive there is no reason one trait would not be equally as easy to retrieve as the other on a self-reference task.&lt;ref name = "source5"/&gt;

==Explanations for the self-reference effect==
While a significant amount of research supports the existence of the self-reference effect, the processes behind it are not well understood. However, multiple hypotheses have been introduced, and two main arguments have been developed: the elaborative processing hypothesis and the organizational processing hypothesis.&lt;ref name="source3"&gt;Klein, S. B., &amp; Loftus, J. (1988). The nature of self-referent encoding: The contributions of elaborative and organizational processes. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 55''(1), 5-11. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.55.1.5&lt;/ref&gt; Encodings in reference to the self are so elaborate because of the information one has about the self.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt; Information encoded with the self is better remembered than information encoded with reference to something else.&lt;ref name="source34"&gt;Bennett, M., Allan, S., Anderson, J., &amp; Asker, N. (2010). On the robustness of the group reference effect. European Journal of Social Psychology, 40(2), 349-354.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elaboration===
Elaboration refers to the encoding of a single word by forming connections between it and other material already stored in memory.&lt;ref name = "source2"/&gt; By creating these connections between the stimulus word and other material already in memory, multiple routes for retrieval of the stimulus word are formed.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt; Based on the depth of processing framework, memory retention increases as elaboration during encoding increases.&lt;ref name = "source2"/&gt; The Elaborative Processing Hypothesis would suggest that any encoding task that leads to the development of the most trace elaboration or associations is the best for memory retention. Additional research on the depth of processing hierarchy suggests that self-reference is the superior method of information encoding. The elaborative hypothesis would suggest this is because self-reference creates the most elaborate trace,&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt; due to the many links that can be made between the stimulus and information about the self already in memory.&lt;ref name = "source2"/&gt;

===Organization===
The organizational processing hypothesis was proposed by Klein and Kihlstrom.&lt;ref name="source2" /&gt; This hypothesis suggests that encoding is best prompted by considering stimulus words in relation to one another. This thought process and relational thinking creates word to word associations.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt; These inter-item associations are paths in memory that can be used during retrieval. Also, the category labels that define the relations between stimulus items can be used as item cues. Evidence of the organizational component of encoding is demonstrated through the clustering of words during recall.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt; Word clustering during recall indicates that relational information was used to store the words in memory. Rogers, Kuiper and Kirker showed that self-referential judgments were more likely to encourage organization than semantic ones.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt; Therefore, they suggested the self-reference effect was likely due to the organizational processing endured by self-referential encoding.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt;

Structural, phonemic and semantic tasks within the depth of processing paradigm require words to be considered individually, and lend themselves to an elaborative approach. As such, it can be argued that self-referential encoding is superior because it leads to an indirect division of words into categories: words that describe me versus words that do not.&lt;ref name = "source2"/&gt; Due to this connection between self-reference and organizational processing, further research has been done on this area. Klein and Kihlstrom's research suggests first that, like previous research, self-reference led to better recall than semantic and structural encoding. Second, they found that self-referentially encoded words were more clustered in recall than words from other tasks, suggesting higher levels of organizational processing. From this they concluded that the organization, not encoding task, is what makes self-referential encoding superior &lt;ref name = "source2"/&gt;

===Dual process===
Psychologists Einstein and Hunt showed that both elaborative processing and organizational processing facilitate recall. However, their research argues that the effectiveness of either approach depends on how related the stimulus words are to one another. A list of highly related stimulus words would be better encoded using the elaborative method. The relations between the words would be evident to subjects; therefore, they would not gain any additional pathways for retrieval by encoding the words based on their categorical membership. Instead, the other information gained through elaborative processing would be more beneficial. On the other hand, a list of stimulus words with little relation would be better stored to memory through the organizational method. Since the words have no obvious connection to one another, subjects would likely encode them individually, using an elaborative approach. Since relational information wouldn't be readily detected, focusing on it would add to memory by creating new traces for retrieval.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, G. O., &amp; Hunt, R. R. (1980). Levels of processing and organization: Additive effects of individual item and relational processing. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory'',''6'', 588-598.&lt;/ref&gt; Superior recall was better explained by a combination of elaboration and organization.
 
Ultimately, the exact processes behind self-referential encoding that makes it superior to other encoding tasks are still under debate. Research suggests that if elaborative processing is behind self-referential encoding, a self-referential task should have the same effect as an elaborative task, whereas if organizational processing underlies the self-reference effect self-referential encoding tasks should function like organizational tasks.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt; To test this, Klein and Loftus ran a 3x2 study testing organizational, elaborative and self-referential encoding with lists of 30 related or unrelated words. When participants were asked to memorize the unrelated list, recall and clustering were higher for the organizational task, which produced almost equal results to the self-referential task, suggesting that has an organizational basis. For the list of related words, the elaborative task led to better recall and had matched results to the self-reference task, suggesting an elaborative basis. This research, then, suggests that the self-reference effect cannot be explained by a single type of processing.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt; Instead, self-referential encoding must lead to information in memory that incorporates item specific and relational information.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt;

Overall, the SRE relies on the unique mnemonic aspects of the self. Ultimately, if the research is suggesting that the self has superior elaborative or organizational properties, information related to the self should be more easily remembered and recalled.&lt;ref name="source4"&gt;Symons, C. S., &amp; Johnson, B. T. (1997). The self-reference effect in memory: A meta-analysis. ''Psychological Bulletin, 121''(3), 371-394. doi:10.1037/0033-2909.121.3.371&lt;/ref&gt; The research presented suggests that self-referential encoding is superior because it promotes organization and elaboration simultaneously, and provides self-relevant categories that promote recall.&lt;ref name = "source4"/&gt;

==Social brain science==
The field of social brain science is aimed at examining the neural foundations of social behavior.&lt;ref name = "source8"/&gt; Neuroimaging and neuropsychology have led to the examination of neuroanatomy and its connection to psychological topics.&lt;ref name="source7"&gt;Mitchell, J. P., Banaji, M. R., &amp; Macrae, C. (2005). The Link between social cognition and self-referential thought in the medial prefrontal cortex. ''Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 17''(8), 1306-1315. doi:10.1162/0898929055002418&lt;/ref&gt; Through this research, neuropsychologists have found a connection between social cognitive functioning and the medial [[prefrontal cortex]] (mPFC). In addition, the mPFC has been connected to reflection and introspection about personal mental states.&lt;ref name = "source7"/&gt; Supporting these findings, it has been shown that damage to the mPFC is connected to impairments with self-reflection, introspection and daydreaming, as well as social competence, but not other areas of functioning.&lt;ref name = "source8"/&gt; As such, the mPFC has been connected to self-referential processing.&lt;ref name = "source6"/&gt;

The research discussed by those focusing on the neuroanatomy of self-referential processing included similar tasks to the memory and depth of processing research discussed previously. When participants were asked to judge adjectives based in whether or not they were self-descriptive, it was noted that the more self-relevant the trait, the stronger the activation of the mPFC. In addition, it was shown that the mPFC was activated during the appraisal of one's own personality traits, as well as during trait retrieval.&lt;ref name = "source6"/&gt; One study showed that the more activity in the mPFC during self-referential judgments, the more likely the word was to be remembered on a subsequent surprise memory test. These results suggest that the mPFC is involved in both self-referential processing and in creating self-relevant memories.&lt;ref name = "source8"/&gt;

Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activation occurs during processing of self-relevant information.&lt;ref name="source33"&gt;Moran, J. M., Macrae, C. N., Heatherton, T. F., Wyland, C. L., &amp; Kelley, W. M. (2006). Neuroanatomical evidence for distinct cognitive and affective components of self. ''Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 18''(9), 1586-1594. doi:10.1162/jocn.2006.18.9.1586&lt;/ref&gt; When self-referent judgment is more relatable and less negative, the mFPC is activated. Finding support clear cut circuits that have high levels of activation when cognitive and emotional aspects of self-reflection are present.&lt;ref name = "source33"/&gt; The [[caudate nucleus]] has not been associated with self-reference before, however, Fossati and colleagues found activity while participants were retrieving self-relevant trait adjectives.&lt;ref&gt;Fossati, P., Hevenor, S. J., Lepage, M., Graham, S. J., Grady, C., Keightley, M. L., et al. (2004). Distributed self in episodic memory: Neural correlates of successful retrieval of self-encoded positive and negative personality traits. ''Neuroimage, 22''(4), 1596-1604. [[doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.03.034|doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.03.034]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "source33"/&gt; The ventral [[Cingulate cortex#Anterior cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate cortex]] (vACC) is also a part of the brain that becomes activated when there are signs of self-referencing and processing. The vACC is activated when self-descriptive information is negative.&lt;ref name = "source33"/&gt; There is also pCC ([[posterior cingulate cortex]]) activity seen in neuroimaging studies during self-referential processing.&lt;ref name = "source33"/&gt;

===Depth of processing or cognitive structure===
Given all of the neurological support for the effect of self-reference on encoding and memory, there is still a debate in the psychological community about whether or not the self-reference effect signifies a special functional role played by the self in cognition. Generally, this question is met by people that have two opposing views on the processes behind self-reference. On one side of the debate, people believe that the self has special mnemonic abilities because it is a unique cognitive structure. On the other side, people support the arguments described above that suggest there is no special structure, but instead, the self-reference effect is simply a part of the standard depth of processing hierarchy. Since the overall hypothesis is the same for both sides of the debate, that self-relevant material leads to enhanced memory, it is difficult to test them using strictly behavioral measures. Therefore, PET and fMRI scans have been used to see the neural marker of self-referential mental activity.&lt;ref name = "source8"/&gt;

Previous studies have shown that areas of the left prefrontal cortex are activated during semantic encoding. Therefore, if the self-reference effect works the same way, as part of the depth of processing hierarchy, the same brain region should be activated when judging traits related to the self. However, if the self has unique mnemonic properties, then self-referential tasks should activate brain regions distinct from those activated during semantic tasks.&lt;ref name = "source8"/&gt; The field is still at is infancy, but future work on this hypothesis might help to settle the debate about the underlying processes of self-referential encoding.

===Simulation theory===
While not able to completely settle the debate over the foundation of self-referential processing, studies on the neurological aspect of personality trait judgments did lead to a related, significant result. It has been shown that judging personality traits about oneself and a close friend activated overlapping brain regions, and the activated regions have all been implicated in self-reference. Noting the similarity between making self-judgments and judgments about close others led to the introduction of the [[simulation theory of empathy]]. Simulation theory rests on the idea that one can make inferences about others by using the knowledge they have about themselves.&lt;ref name = "source6"/&gt; In essence, the theory suggests that people use self-reflection to understand or predict the mental state of others.&lt;ref name = "source7"/&gt; The more similar a person perceives another to be, the more active the mPFC has shown to be, suggesting more deep or intricate self-reference.&lt;ref name = "source6"/&gt; However, this effect can cause people to make inaccurate judgments about others or to believe that their own opinions are representative of others in general. This misrepresentation is referred to as the [[false-consensus effect]].&lt;ref name = "source7"/&gt;

==Expansion of the SRE: group reference==
In addition to simulation theory, other expansions of the self-reference effect have been examined. Through studying the self, researchers have found that the self consists of many independent cognitive representations. For example, the personal self composed of individual characteristics is separate from the relational self which is based on relationships with significant others. These two forms of self are again separate from the collective self which corresponds to a particular group identity.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer M. B. ,&amp; Gardner, W. (1996). Who is this 'We'? Levels of collective identity and self representations. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 71'', 83–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Noting the existence of the collective self and the different group identities that combine to form such a self-representation led researchers to question if information stored in reference to a social group identity has the same effects in memory as information stored in reference to the individual self. In essence, researchers questioned if the self-reference effect can be extended to include situations where the self is more socially defined, producing a group-reference effect.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt;

Previous research supports the idea that the group-reference effect should exist from a theoretical standpoint. First, the self-expansion model argues that individuals incorporate characteristics of their significant others (or other in-group members &lt;ref&gt;Wright, S.C., Aron A., McLaughlin-Volpe, T., &amp; Ropp, S. A. (1997). The extended contact effect: Knowledge of cross-group friendships and prejudice. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 73'', 73–90.&lt;/ref&gt; into the development of their self-concept.&lt;ref&gt;Aron, A., Aron, E., Tudor, M., &amp; Nelson, G. (1991). Close relationships as including other and self. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 60'', 241–253.&lt;/ref&gt; From this model, it is reasonable to conclude that characteristics that are common to both oneself and their significant others (or in-group members) would be more accessible.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt; Second, the previous research discussed suggests that the self-reference effect is due to some combination of organizational, elaborative, mental cueing or evaluative properties of self-referential encoding tasks. Given that we have significant stores of knowledge about our social identities, and such collective identities provide an organizational framework, it is reasonable to assume that a group-reference task would operate similar to that of a self-reference task.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt;

In order to test these claims, Johnson and colleagues aimed to test whether the self-reference effect generalized to group level identities. Their first study was structured to simply assess if group-reference influenced subsequent memory. In their experiment, they used membership at a particular university as the group of reference. They included group-reference, self-reference and semantic tasks. The experiment replicated the self-reference effect, consistent with previous research. In addition, evidence for a group-reference effect was found.  Group-referenced encoding produced better recall than the semantic tasks, and the level of recall from the group-referenced task was not significantly different from the self-referenced task.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt;

Despite finding evidence of a group-reference effect, Johnson and colleagues pointed out that people identify with numerous groups, each with unique characteristics. Therefore, in order to reach conclusive evidence of a group-reference effect, alternative group targets need to be considered. In a second experiment by Johnson et al., the group of reference was modified to be the family of the individual. This group has fewer exemplars than the pool of university students, and affective considerations of the family as a group should be strong. No specific instructions or definitions were provided for family, allowing individuals to consider either the group as a whole (prototype) or specific exemplars (group). When the experiment was repeated using family as the group of reference, group-reference produced recall as much as self-reference. The mean number of recall for the group-reference was higher than self-reference.  Participants indicated that they considered both the prototype and individual exemplars when responding to the questions, suggesting that the magnitude of the group-reference effect might not be dependent on the number of exemplars in the target group.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt;
 
Both experiments presented by Johnson et al. found evidence for the group-reference effect. However, these conclusions are limited to the target groups of university students and family. Other research included gender (males and females) and religion (Jewish) as the reference groups and the group-reference effect on memory was not as evident. The group-reference recall for these two groups was not significantly more advantageous than the semantic task. Questioning what characteristics of reference groups that lead to the group-reference effect, a meta-analysis of all four group-reference conditions was performed. This analysis found that self-reference emerged as the most powerful encoding device; however, evidence was found to support the existence of a group-reference effect. The size of the reference groups and number of specific, individual exemplars was hypothesized to influence the existence of the group-reference effect. In addition, accessibility and level of knowledge about group members may also impact such an effect. So, while university students is a much larger group than family, individual exemplars may be more readily accessible than those in a religious group. Similarly, different cognitive representations were hypothesized to influence the group-reference effect. When a larger group is considered, people may be more likely to consider a prototype which may lead to fewer elaborations and cues later on. Smaller groups may lead to relying on the prototype and specific exemplars.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt; Finally, desirability judgments that influence later processing may be influenced by self-reference and certain group-reference tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, T. J., Rule, G. R., &amp; Carlson, D. (1983). Memory for personally relevant information. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 44'', 251–261.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals may be more sensitive to evaluative implications for the personal self and some group identities, but not others.&lt;ref&gt;Gaertner, L., Sedikides, C., &amp; Graetz, K. (1999). In search of self-definition: Motivational primacy of the individual self, motivational primacy of the collective self, or contextual primacy? ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 76'', 5–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups are also a major part of the self; therefore we attribute the role that different groups play in our self-concept also play a role in the self-reference effect.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt;  We process information about group members similarly to how we process for ourselves.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt; Recall of remarks referencing our home and our self and group to familiarity of those aspects of our self.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt; Reference to the self and social group and the identity that comes along with being a part of a social group are equally affective for memory.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt; This is especially true when the groups are small, rather than large.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt;

Ultimately, the group-reference effect provides evidence to explain the tendency to notice or pay attention to and remember statements made in regard to our home when traveling in a foreign place.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt; Considering the proposal that groups form part of the self, this phenomenon can be considered an extension of the self-reference effect. Similar to the memorable nature of references to a person's individual self, references to social identities are seemed to be privileged in memory as well.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt;

==Applications==
Once the foundation of research on self-referential encoding was established, psychologists began to explore how the concept applied to different groups of people, and connected to different phenomena.

===Autism spectrum disorder===
Individuals diagnosed with [[autism spectrum]] disorders (ASDs) can display a wide range of symptoms.  Some of the most common characteristics of individuals with ASDs include impairments with social functioning, language and communication difficulties, repetitive behaviors and restricted interests. In addition, it is often noted that these individuals are more "self-focused." That is, they have difficulty seeing things from another's perspective.&lt;ref name="source10"&gt;Lombardo, M. V., Barnes, J. L., Wheelwright, S. J., Cohen-Baron, S. (2007). Self-referential cognition and empathy in autism. ''PLoS ONE, 2''(9), e883. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0000883&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being self-focused, though, research has shown that individuals with ASD's often have difficulty identifying or describing their emotions or the emotions of others. When asked to describe their daily experiences, responses from individuals on the autism spectrum tended to focus more on physical descriptions rather than mental and emotional states. In regards to their social interactions and behavior differences, it is thought that these individuals lack top down control, and therefore, their bottom up decisions remain unchecked. This simply suggests that these individuals cannot use their prior knowledge and memory to make sense of new input, but instead react to each new input individually, compiling them to make a whole picture &lt;ref name = "source10"/&gt;

Noting the difficulty individuals with ASDs experience with [[self-awareness]], it was thought that they might have difficulty with self-related memory processes.&lt;ref name="source9"&gt;Henderson, H. A., Zahka, N. E., Kojkowski, N. M., Inge, A. P., Schwartz, C. B., Hileman, C. M., &amp; ... Mundy, P. C. (2009). Self-referenced memory, social cognition, and symptom presentation in autism. ''Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 50''(7), 853-861. doi:10.1111/j.1469-7610.2008.02059.x&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists questioned if these individuals would show the typical self-reference effect in memory.&lt;ref name = "source10"/&gt; In one Depth of Processing Study, participants were asked questions about the descriptiveness of certain stimulus words. However, unlike previous DOP studies that focused on phonemic, structural, semantic and self-referential tasks, the tasks were altered for this experiment. To test the referential abilities of individuals with ASD's, the encoding tasks were divided into: "the self," asking to what extent a stimulus word described oneself, "similar close other," asking to what extent a stimulus word was descriptive of one's best friend, "dissimilar non-close other," asking to what extent a stimulus word was descriptive of Harry Potter, and a control group that was asked to determine the number of syllables in each word. Following these encoding tasks, participants were given thirty minutes before a surprise memory task. It was found that individuals with ASD's had no impairment in memory for words encoded in the syllable or dissimilar non-close other condition. However, they had decreased memory for words related to the self.&lt;ref name = "source10"/&gt;

Therefore, while research suggests that self-referentially encoded information is encoded more deeply than other information, the research on individuals with ASD's showed no advantage for memory recognition with self-reference tasks over semantic encoding tasks. This suggests that individuals with ASD's don't preferentially encode self-relevant information. Psychologists have investigated the biological basis for the decreased self-reference effect among individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders and have suggested that it may be due to less specialized neural activity in the mPFC for those individuals.&lt;ref name = "source9"/&gt; However, while individuals with ASD's showed smaller self-reference effects than the control group, some evidence of a self-reference effect was evident in some cases. This indicates that self-referent impairments are a matter of degree, not total absence.&lt;ref name = "source10"/&gt;

Lombardo and his colleagues measured empathy among individuals with ASD's, and showed that these individuals scored lower than the control group on all empathy measures.&lt;ref name = "source10"/&gt; This may be a result of the difficulty for these individuals to understand or take the perspective of others, in conjunction with their difficulty identifying emotions. This has implications for simulation theory, because these individuals are unable to use their self-knowledge to make conclusions about similar others.

Ultimately, the research suggests that people with ASD's might benefit from being more self-focused. The better their ability to reflect on themselves, the better the can [[mentalization|mentalize]] with others.&lt;ref name = "source10"/&gt;

===Depression===
There are three possible relations between cognitive processes and  [[anxiety]] and [[depression (mood)|depression]]. The first is whether cognitive processes are actually caused by the onset of clinically diagnosed symptoms of [[Major depressive disorder|major depression]] or just generalized sadness or anxiousness. The second is whether emotional disorders such as depression and anxiety are able to be considered as caused by cognitions. And the third is whether different specific cognitive processes are able to be considered associates of different disorders.&lt;ref name="source11"&gt;Strauman, T. J. (1989). Self-discrepancies in clinical depression and social phobia: Cognitive structures that underlie emotional disorders?. ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 98''(1), 14-22. doi:10.1037/0021-843X.98.1.14&lt;/ref&gt; Kovacs and Beck (1977) posited a schematic model of depression where an already depressed self was primed by outside prompts that negatively impacted cognitive illusions of the world in the eye of oneself. These prompts only led participants to a more depressive series of emotions and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Kovacs, M., &amp; Beck, A. T. (1977). Cognitive-affective processes in depression. In C. E. Izard (Ed.), ''Emotions and psychopathology'' (pp.79-107). New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The results from the study done by Derry and Kuiper supported Beck's theory that a negative self-schema is present in people, especially those with depressive disorder.&lt;ref name="source13" /&gt; Depressed individuals attribute depressive adjectives to themselves more than nondepressive adjectives.&lt;ref name="source12"&gt;Dobson, K. S., &amp; Shaw, B. F. (1987). Specificity and stability of self-referent encoding in clinical depression. ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 96''(1), 34-40. doi:10.1037/0021-843X.96.1.34&lt;/ref&gt; Those suffering from a more mild case of depression have trouble deciphering between the traits of themselves and others which results in a loss of their self-esteem and their negative self-evaluation. A depressive schema is what causes the negativity reported by those suffering from depression.&lt;ref name="source13"&gt;Kuiper, N. A., &amp; Derry, P. A. (1982). Depressed and nondepressed content self-reference in mild depressives. ''Journal of Personality, 50''(1), 67-80. doi:10.1111/j.1467-6494.1982.tb00746.x&lt;/ref&gt; Kuiper and Derry found that self-referent recall enhancement was limited only to nondepressed content.&lt;ref name = "source13"/&gt;

Generally, self-focus is association with negative emotions. In particular private self-focus is more strongly associated with depression than public self-focus.&lt;ref&gt;Mor, N., &amp; Winquist, J. Self-focused attention and negative affect: A meta-analysis. ''Psychological Bulletin, 128''(4), 636-662. doi: 10.1037/0033-2909.128.4.638&lt;/ref&gt;  Results from brain-imaging studies shows
that during self-referential processing, those with major depressive disorder show greater activation in the medial prefrontal cortex, suggesting that depressed individuals may be exhibiting greater cognitive control than
non-depressed individuals when processing self-relevant information.&lt;ref name="source35"&gt;Lemogne, C., le Bastard, G., Mayberg, H., Volle, E., Bergouignan, L., Lehericy, S., et al. (2009). In search of the depressive self: extended medial prefrontal network during self-referential processing in major depression. ''Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, 4'', 305-312.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of [[sociolinguistics]], '''social network''' describes the structure of a particular [[speech community]].  Social networks are composed of a "web of ties" ([[Lesley Milroy]]) between individuals, and the structure of a [[Social network|network]] will vary depending on the types of connections it is composed of. Social network theory (as used by sociolinguists) posits that social networks, and the interactions between members within the networks, are a driving force behind language change.

==Structure==
[[File:Social-network.png|thumb|247x247px|A very simple social network. The black lines represent connections between individuals.]]

===Participants===
The key participant in a social network is the ''anchor'', or center individual.  From this anchor, ties of varying strengths radiate outwards to other people with whom the anchor is directly linked.  These people are represented by ''points''. Participants in a network, regardless of their position, can also be referred to as ''actors ''or ''members''.

===Relationships===
There are multiple ways to describe the structure of a social network. Among them are ''density, member closeness centrality, multiplexity, ''and'' orders''. These metrics measure the different ways of connecting within of a network, and when used together they provide a complete picture of the structure of a particular network.

A social network is defined as either "loose" or "tight" depending on how connected its members are with each other, as measured by factors like density and multiplexity.&lt;ref&gt;Wardhaugh, Ronald (2006). ''An Introduction to Sociolinguistics''. New York: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;  This measure of tightness is essential to the study of socially motivated language change because the tightness of a social network correlates with lack of innovation in the population's speech habits. Conversely, a loose network is more likely to innovate linguistically.

====Density====
The density of a given social network is found by dividing the number of all existing links between the actors by the number of potential links within the same set of actors.&lt;ref name="Bergs 2005"&gt;Bergs, A. (2005). ''Social Networks and Historical Sociolinguistics: Studies in Morphosyntactic Variation in the Paston Letters''. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter. 22-37.&lt;/ref&gt;  The higher the resulting number, the more dense a network is. Dense networks are most likely to be found in small, stable communities with few external contacts and a high degree of social cohesion.  Loose social networks, by contrast, are more liable to develop in larger, unstable communities that have many external contacts and exhibit a relative lack of social cohesion.&lt;ref&gt;Trudgill, Peter (2010). ''Investigations in Sociohistorical Linguistics''. Cambridge: University Press. 61-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Member closeness centrality====
Member closeness centrality is the measurement of how close an individual actor is to all the other actors in the community. An actor with high closeness centrality is a central member, and thus has frequent interaction with other members of the network. A central member of a network tends to be under pressure to maintain the norms of that network, while a peripheral member of the network (one with a low closeness centrality score) does not face such pressure.&lt;ref name="Milroy 1987"&gt;Milroy, L. (1987). ''Language and Social Networks''. New York: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, central members of a given network are typically not the first members to adopt a linguistic innovation because they are socially motivated to speak according to pre-existing norms within the network.&lt;ref name="Milroy 2002"&gt;Milroy, Lesley (2002). "Social Networks". In: ''The Handbook of Language Variation and Change''. Oxford. Blackwell. 549-572.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Multiplexity====
Multiplexity is the number of separate social connections between any two actors. It has been defined as the "interaction of exchanges within and across relationships".&lt;ref name="Bliemel, McCarthy and Maine 2014"&gt;Bliemel, M.J., McCarthy, I.P., &amp; Maine, E. (2014). "An Integrated Approach to Studying Multiplexity in Entrepreneurial Networks". Entrepreneurship Research Journal, 4(4), 367-402.&lt;/ref&gt; A single tie between individuals, such as a shared workplace, is a uniplex relationship. A tie between individuals is multiplex'' ''when those individuals interact in multiple social contexts.  For instance, A is B's boss, and they have no relationship outside of work, so their relationship is uniplex. However, C is both B's coworker and neighbor, so the relationship between B and C is multiplex, since they interact with each other in a variety of social roles.&lt;ref name="Bergs 2005" /&gt;

====Orders====
Orders are a way of defining the place of a speaker within a social network. Actors are classified into three different zones
[[File:Visualization of two sampling zones of a social network, snowball sampling technique.jpg|right|thumb|
Visualization of [[snowball sampling]] technique showing two sampling zones. The first-order zone contains 7 individuals (black nodes). The second-order zone contains individuals that have direct contact to individuals in the first-order zone. The circles indicate the boundaries of the zones.
|254x254px]] depending on the strength of their connection to a certain actor.&lt;ref name="Milroy 1980"&gt;Milroy, L. (1980). Language and Social Networks. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; The closer an individual's connection to the central member is, the more powerful an individual will be within their network. Social network theories of language change look for correlation between a speaker's order and their use of prestigious or non-prestigious linguistic variants.
* '''First order zone'''
A ''first order zone'' is composed of all individuals that are directly linked to any given individual. The first order zone can also be referred to as the "interpersonal environment"&lt;ref&gt;Rossi, Peter H. 1966. "Research strategies in measuring peer group influence," Pp. 190-214 in College Peer Grotips, edited by Theodore h4. Newcomb and Everett K. Wilson. Chicago: Aldine.&lt;/ref&gt; or "neighborhood". A first order member of a network is an actor who has a large number of direct connections to the center of the network.
* '''Second order zone'''
A ''second order zone'' is a grouping of any individuals who are connected to at least one actor within the first order zone. However, actors in the second order zone are not directly connected to the central member of the network. A second order member has a loose or indirect connection to the network, and may only be connected to a certain network member.
* '''Third order zone'''
A ''third order zone'' is made up of newly observed individuals not directly connected to the first order zone.&lt;ref&gt;Milroy, Leslie and Matthew Gordon (2008). "The Concept of Social Network". "Sociolinguistics: Method and Interpretation". Oxford: John Wiley &amp; Sons. 116-133.&lt;/ref&gt; Third order members may be connected to actors in the second order zone, but not the first. They are peripheral members of the network, and are often the actors with the lowest member closeness centrality, since they may not have frequent contact with other members of the network.

==Language change==

===Sociolinguistic research===

====Fieldwork====
Social networks are used in sociolinguistics to explain linguistic variation in terms of community norms, rather than broad categories like gender or race.&lt;ref name="Milroy 1980" /&gt; Instead of focusing on the social characteristics of speakers, social network analysis concentrates on the relationships between speakers, then considers linguistic change in the light of those relationships. In an effort to depart from [[Variation (linguistics)|variationist sociolinguistics]],&lt;ref&gt;E.g., in the opening chapter of The Handbook of Language Variation and Change (ed. Chambers et al., Blackwell 2002), J.K. Chambers writes that "variationist sociolinguistics had its effective beginnings only in 1963, the year in which William Labov presented the first sociolinguistic research report"; the dedication page of the Handbook says that Labov's "ideas imbue every page".&lt;/ref&gt; the concept of the social network has been used to examine the links between the strength of [[Interpersonal ties|network ties]] and the use of a linguistic variant. This allows researchers to create an accurate picture of a community's language use without resorting to stereotypical classification.

The concept of social networks is applicable at both the macro and micro levels.  Social networks are at work in communities as large as nation-states or as small as an online dating service. They can also be applied to intimate social groups such as a friendship, family unit, or neighborhood. Because even the smallest of networks contains an enormous number of potential connections between actors, sociolinguists usually only study small networks so that the fieldwork is manageable. In fact, even when studying small networks, sociolinguists rely on the metrics outlined in the previous section, rather than mapping the network out, one connection at a time. One way of mapping the general structure of a network is to assign a ''strength scale'' to each speaker. For example, in Lesley Milroy's study of social networks in Belfast, Northern Ireland, the researchers measured five social variables, which together generated a strength scale for each member of the network: 
: (1) Membership of a high-density, territorially based cluster.
: (2) Having substantial ties of kinship in the neighborhood (more than one household, in addition to his own nuclear family). 
: (3) Working at the same place as at least two others from the same area. 
: (4) The same place of work as at least two others of the same sex from the area. 
: (5) Voluntary association with work mates in leisure hours.&lt;ref name="Milroy 1980" /&gt;
The allocation of a network strength score allows the network patterns of individuals to be measured and possible links with linguistic patterns to be tested.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Jonathan (2004). ''Language Change and Sociolinguistics: Rethinking Social Networks (Palgrave Studies in Language Variation)''. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Computational modeling====
In recent years, [[computer simulation]] and modeling have been used to study social networks from a broader perspective.&lt;ref name="Fagyal 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bergs 2010"&gt;Bergs, A. (2006). Analyzing online communication from a social network point of view: questions, problems, perspectives. Language@Internet, 3, article 3. (urn:nbn:de:0009-7-3712)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swarup"&gt;Swarup, S., Apolloni, A. &amp; Fagyal, Z. (2011). A model of norm emergence and innovation in language change.. In L. Sonenberg, P. Stone, K. Tumer &amp; P. Yolum (eds.), AAMAS (p./pp. 693-700), : IFAAMAS. {{ISBN|978-0-9826571-5-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because previous social network studies were focused on individual connections, the size of the networks were limited so that the researcher could work personally with subjects. With the rise of advanced computer modeling techniques, sociolinguists have been able to study the linguistic behavior of large networks of individuals over long periods of time without the inconvenience of individually working with thousands of subjects.

Advances in computer simulation and modeling technology have been used to study social networks on a larger scale, both with more participants and over a greater span of time.&lt;ref name="Fagyal 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bergs 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Swarup" /&gt;  Previous social network studies had to examine individual connections in great detail, and so had to limit the size of the networks involved.  Linguists working in the field were also unable to accurately pinpoint the causes of linguistic change because it tends to occur slowly over a long period of time, on a scale beyond the scope of a single research project.  With the rise of computer modeling, sociolinguists have been able to study the linguistic behavior of large networks without the huge expenditure of time required to individually work with thousands of subjects long-term. The pioneering study in this field was Fagyal et al. in 2011.&lt;ref name="Fagyal 2010" /&gt;

===Social network theory===
Because social networks investigate the forces that impact individual behavior, rather than simply attributing linguistic difference to social class, a theory of language change based on social networks is able to explain linguistic behavior more deeply than variationist sociolinguistics. The two major findings of social network theory are that dense (highly interconnected) networks are resistant to change, and that most linguistic change is initiated by weak links—people who are not centrally connected to the network in question. Though most sociolinguistics working on social networks agree on these findings, there has been extended debate about which actors in the network are the primary drivers of linguistic change. The results of this debate are two theories, the strong-tie theory, and the weak-tie theory.

====Strong tie theory====
: The strong tie theory, or agentive theory, has long been thought of in classical sociolinguistic theory as a driver of change, even prior to social network theory.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, J. C 1969. The concept and use of social networks. See Ref. 40, I-50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, D. 1972. Social Circles, Scale and Social Organization. Presented to Burg Wartenstein Symp. 25. Scale and Social Organization, Wenner-Gren Found. Anthropol. Res.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, J. A. (1969). Graph theory and social networks: A technical comment on connectedness and connectivity. Sociology 3(2):215-32&lt;/ref&gt;  In the context of [[social network theory]], agents are the people who are most connected to others in the network, and whose [[Style (sociolinguistics)|speech style]] is often imitated by people within the network. These agents also regulate language usage inside the network, and therefore ensure the dominance of their preferred variant form throughout the network, because group members are more likely to adopt high-status variants.  Strong tie networks are believed to be resistant to linguistic innovation, because prestige forms also tend to be conservative forms.&lt;ref&gt;Labov, W. 1969. 'Contraction, Deletion, and Inherent Variability of the English Copula'. Language 45: 715-762&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milroy, Lesley. 1980. Language and social networks. London; Baltimore: Basil Blackwell; University Park Press. xii, 218 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; Central agents are also able to engage in dialogues with leaders in other network. According to strong-tie theory, this is how new variants are spread. [[William Labov]]'s study of Philadelphia speech communities provides an example of the strong-tie theory.&lt;ref name="Fagyal 2010"&gt;Fagyal, Zsuzsanna; Swarup, Samarth; Escobar, Anna Maria; Gasser, Les; and Lakkaraju, Kiran (2010) "Centers, Peripheries, and Popularity: The Emergence of Norms in Simulated Networks of Linguistic Influence," University of Pennsylvania Working Papers in Linguistics: Vol. 15: Iss. 2, Article 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Weak tie theory====
: Sociolinguists have recently begun to focus their studies on [[Interpersonal ties|weak links]]: individuals who are not closely tied to a group, such as people who move frequently or live in isolated areas.&lt;ref name="cite jstor|2776392"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Granovetter | first1 = M.

L., et al. (1983) Sociolinguistic variation and linguistic change in Belfast.&lt;/ref&gt;  Agents who are weakly connected are more likely to come into contact with new linguistic variants, since they spend most of their time interacting with people outside of the central network.&lt;ref&gt;Granovetter, Mark S. 1983. The strength of weak ties: a network theory revisited. Sociological Theory 1:201–233.&lt;/ref&gt;  Loosely connected individuals are also under less social pressure to conform to group language practices than integral members.&lt;ref name="Milroy 1983" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eckert, Penelope. 2005. Variation, convention, and social meaning. Plenary talk at the Annual Meeting of the Linguistic Society of America, Oakland, CA. Retrieved 15 August 2008 from http://www.stanford.edu/~eckert/EckertLSA2005.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Weak-tie social network theory postulates that linguistic variables are spread by means of weak, uni-dimensional social links between non-central individuals. Therefore it is the case that language change will have the propensity to be faster in larger communities rather than in smaller communities.&lt;ref&gt;Trudgill, Peter (2001). Extract from Peter Trudgill (2002). Sociolinguistic Variation and Change. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Support for this theory is found in Labov's study of "lames" in Harlem, and in [[Lesley Milroy]]'s 1987 Belfast study.&lt;ref name="Milroy 2002" /&gt;

==Linguistic studies==

===Support for the strong-tie theory===

====The jocks and burnouts study====
{{main|Jocks and Burnouts}}
This study demonstrated that actors chose to imitate other (more prestigious) actors who embodied desirable social attributes, especially "toughness" as exemplified by urban students. This imitation of desirable qualities indicates that strongly connected agents lead change by spreading norms through network members. In [[Penelope Eckert|Eckert's]] study of speech norms in Detroit high schools, she notes that suburban youth adopted the speech traits of urban youth (including a diphthongized and lowered [i]).&lt;ref name="Milroy 2002" /&gt;

====The Philadelphia study====
Labov's 1986 study of Philadelphia speech communities (a term used before "social networks" became widespread) demonstrated that the agents of linguistic change were the leaders of the speech communities. Actors with high levels of prestige in the linguistic led the use of these forms, and enforced them as norms within the community. Members of this network then used the forms normalized within the network outside of the network, and continuous usage led to wide adoption of these speech norms.&lt;ref name="Milroy 2002" /&gt;

====The Japanese school study====
Takeshi Sibata's 1960 study of elementary school children&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, J.K. (2009). Sociolinguistic Theory. Linguistic variation and its social significance (3rd Ed.). Oxford:Blackwell. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; provides strong support for the view that insiders, or leaders, in a social network facilitate language change. He interviewed several elementary school children, and taught them some invented words he created for the purpose of this study. After teaching the students these words, and telling them to teach the other students these words, he came back a week later to observe the results. A few children, those who were popular, friendly, cheerful, active in class activities, were the main people who spread those words. As the centers of their respective networks, these children functioned as strong-tie leaders of linguistic change.

===Support for the weak-tie theory===

====The Harlem study====
Labov's 1966 study of [[African American Vernacular English]] in South [[Harlem]],&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William. 1966. The Social Stratification of English in New York City. Washington D.C.: Center for Applied Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; revealed that second-order actors in African American social networks were the initiators of linguistic change in their communities. Though these second-order actors, or "lames" were not held in high regard by the leaders of the speech network, they had connections to other networks, and were sources of new linguistic variables. This study served as the basis of the ''Weak Tie Theory'' proposed by Milroy and Milroy.
[[File:Belfast City Center.gif|thumb|right|Map of central Belfast|225x225px]]

====The Belfast studies====

=====Belfast: the original study=====
This [[Lesley Milroy|Milroy and Milroy]] study examined vernacular English as it was spoken in inner-city Belfast in the 1970s, in three working class communities in Belfast: those in the Ballymacarrett area, the Hammer area, and the Clonard area.  Milroy took part in the life of each community as an acquaintance, or 'friend of a friend', investigating the correlation between the integration of individuals in the community and the way those individuals speak.

Each individual studied was given a network strength score based on the person's knowledge of other people in the community, the workplace and at leisure activities to give a score of 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest network 'strength score'. Out of the five variables, one measured density, while the other four measured multiplexity.

Each person's use of phonological variables, (ai), (a), (l), (th), (ʌ), (e), which were clearly indexical of the Belfast urban speech community, were then measured. The independent variables for this study were age, sex and location. These linguistic variables made up the dependent variable of the study, and were analyzed in relation to the network structure and background of each individual speaker. Deviation from the regional standard was determined by density and multiplicity of the social networks into which speakers are integrated.

The researchers found that a high network strength score was correlated with the use of vernacular forms, and therefore that the use of vernacular variants was strongly influenced by the level of integration into a network. The conclusion of the study was that close-knit networks are important for dialect maintenance.

=====Belfast: subsequent study=====
This 1987 study, also conducted by Milroy, examined the variable [u], and its relationship to working class identity. The researchers found that actors with the weakest tie to this community identity were most likely to use the variable [u], possibly as a way to strengthen their ties to the network.

In Ballymacarrett, one of the villages the researchers surveyed, unrounded [u] was most often used by young males and females, who had weak ties to the working class networks, but use the variables frequently to project an image of working-class toughness. These young people often interacted with members of other social networks, and thus spread the [u] realization through their own social networks, which resulted in the adoption of unrounded [u] in most of Belfast. These results provide support for the weak tie theory of language change, because it was the actors on the peripheries of social networks who were responsible for spreading linguistic change. 
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Diffusion curve of linguistic variants on a condensed time scale.tif|thumb|right|Diffusion curves displaying the number of agents who adopted each of the competing variants in the network over time. ]] --&gt;

===Bridging the two theories===

====The leaders and loners study====
One key study that employed computer simulations was Fagyal, Swarup, Escobar, Gasser, and Lakkarajud's work on the roles of group insiders (leaders) and outsiders (loners) in language change.&lt;ref name="Fagyal 2010" /&gt; The researchers found that both first-order and second-order network members (also known as "leaders" and "loners") were both needed in order for changes to spread predictably within the network.

In this study, the researchers simulated a social network of 900 participants, called nodes, which were connected into a network using a matrix algorithm. They then randomly assigned a linguistic variant to each node. On each cycle of the algorithm, every node interacted with another node, and the variant assigned to each node changed randomly depending on which variant the other node had. This cycle was repeated 40,000 times, and at the end of each cycle, the variant connected to each node was recorded.

The results of the Fagyal et al. study indicated that "in a large, socially heterogenous population", one linguistic variant eventually became the community norm, though other variants were not entirely eliminated. However, when the researchers manipulated the network to remove either loners or leaders, the results changed: without loners, one variant rapidly caused the loss of all other variants; and without leaders, no single variant became the norm for a majority of speakers.

These findings allowed the researchers to address the major debate in social network theory: whether it is leaders (or centers) or loners who are responsible for language change. In their findings, the presence of both leaders and loners was essential, though the two types of agents played different roles in the process of change.

Rather than introducing entirely new forms, leaders accelerate the adoption of forms that already exist within the network. Conversely, the researchers describe the loners' role this way: "when loners are a part of a population structure that allows their influence to reach centrally-connected hubs, they can have a decisive impact on the linguistic system over time."

Previously, researchers had posited that loners preserved old forms that had been neglected by the larger community. Fagyal et al. complicate this claim by suggesting that the role of loners in a network is to safeguard old features, then reintroduce them to the community.

===New work on online social networks===

====The Internet Chatrooms study====
The researchers in Berg's 2006 study of digital social networks as linguistic social networks note the value of social networks as both linguistic corpuses and linguistic networks.&lt;ref name="Bergs 2010" /&gt;

====The Facebook study====
In Carmen Perez-Sabater's 2012 study of Facebook users,&lt;ref&gt;Pérez-Sabater, Carmen (2012). "The Linguistics of Social Networking: A Study of Writing Conventions on Facebook". http://www.linguistik-online.de/56_12/perez-sabater.html&lt;/ref&gt; she discusses the use of English by native and non-native speakers on university Facebook pages. The researchers categorize these posts as a model of "[[computer-mediated communication]]", a new communication style that combines features of writing and speech. Facebook posts generally have a degree of informality, whether the users are native or nonnative English speakers, but native English speakers often have a higher degree of informality. For example, non-native speakers cited in the study use separated letter-style greetings and salutations, indicating [[linguistic insecurity]]. The conclusions of the study were that "computer-mediated communication" do not always tend toward informality, and that online social networks pattern similarly to non-virtual social networks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10216">'''Speech Pathology Australia''' (SPA) is the national peak body for the [[speech pathology]] profession in Australia.

== History of the association ==
Established in 1949, SPA began as the '''Australian College of Speech Therapists''', set up to regulate and maintain the qualifications and standards of the profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article26599261?searchTerm=australian%20college%20of%20speech%20therapists&amp;searchLimits=l-title=The+Argus+%28Melbourne%2C...|title=College meeting|publisher=[[Trove]] (original article published in [[The Argus (Melbourne)|''The Argus'']])|date=27 March 1954|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Australian Branch of the [[British Medical Association]] "granted the Australian College of Speech Therapists full professional recognition as the examining, qualifying and representative body for speech therapy within the Commonwealth".&lt;ref&gt;Eldridge, M. (1968). ''A history of the treatment of speech disorders''. Edinburgh: E. &amp; S. Livingstone.&lt;/ref&gt;   

The new organisation combined the '''Victorian Council of Speech Therapy''', the '''Australian Association of Speech Therapists (New South Wales)''', the '''South Australian Council of Speech Science and Speech Therapy''', and the '''Council for Speech Therapy (Western Australia)''', and granted members the right to practice in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18406324?searchTerm=%20%20speech%20therapy&amp;searchLimits=l-title=The+Argus+%28Melbourne%2C...|titleid%3A13|||l-title=The+Sydney+Morning+Herald+%28NSW+%3A+1842-1954%29|titleid%3A35&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In 1974-5, the organisation became the '''Australian Association of Speech &amp; Hearing'''. The association no longer conducted examinations nor granted licentiates to graduates, a responsibility that was taken over by tertiary institutions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.speechpathologyaustralia.org.au/library/Oral%20History%20Poster%20P.1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1996 the organisation became the '''Speech Pathology Association of Australia Ltd''' and adopted the public name of Speech Pathology Australia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.speechpathologyaustralia.org.au/library/Oral%20History%20Poster%20P.1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Speech therapy in Australia and Elinor Wray ==
Sydney-born Elinor Wray undertook speech therapy training at the [[Central School of Speech and Drama]] and [[St Thomas’s Hospital]] in London, as well as observing speech therapy practice at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital|St Bartholomew’s Hospital]] and [[King's College Hospital|King’s College Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chw.edu.au/site/directory/entries/speechpath.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  She then spent three months observing at the London County Council Stammering Centres before returning to Sydney in 1929 to establish the first Australian speech therapy service.&lt;ref&gt;http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18106615?searchTerm=elinor%20wray&amp;searchLimits=l-title=The+Argus+%28Melbourne%2C...|titleid%3A13|||l-title=The+Sydney+Morning+Herald+%28NSW+%3A+1842-1954%29|titleid%3A35&lt;/ref&gt;  

Appointed in an honorary capacity at the [[Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children]] at Camperdown, Sydney (now located at Westmead) on the recommendation of surgeon (and later president of the hospital) Sir Robert Wade&lt;ref&gt;D.G. Hamilton, Hand in Hand: The Story of the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children. Sydney, John Ferguson&lt;/ref&gt; in 1931, Wray voluntarily conducted three clinics weekly for the next seven years,  initially working with Sir Robert’s [[cleft palate]] patients.&lt;ref&gt;http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18106615?searchTerm=elinor%20wray&amp;searchLimits=l-title=The+Argus+%28Melbourne%2C...|titleid%3A13|||l-title=The+Sydney+Morning+Herald+%28NSW+%3A+1842-1954%29|titleid%3A35&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting positive outcomes led to the creation of the first hospital speech therapy clinic and the speech pathology profession in Australia.

Wray continued to work as a speech therapist until she retired and Speech Pathology Australia’s outstanding contribution to the profession award is named in her honour.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.speechpathologyaustralia.org.au/membership/awards&lt;/ref&gt; Wray died at the age of 98 in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Morning Herald, Tuesday 8 December 1992, p 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership ==
Association membership is available to all applicants with approved qualifications in speech pathology from an Australian accredited university course and students enrolled in a recognised Australian accredited course by the Association.

== Code of Ethics ==
All members are bound by the [http://www.speechpathologyaustralia.org.au/library/Ethics/CodeofEthics.pdf Association’s Code of Ethics] to ensure the responsible and ethical practice of speech pathologists. The Code of Ethics outlines in detail the values, principles and standards of practice all members must follow.

== Overseas accreditation ==
As the recognised national professional standards organisation for speech pathologists in Australia, the Association is recognised by the [[Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations]] (DEEWR) as the assessing authority for speech pathologists intending to apply for skilled migration to Australia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.immi.gov.au/asri/occupations/s/speech-pathologist.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Most employers in Australia require prospective employees to be eligible for practising membership of Speech Pathology Australia.  

A mutual recognition agreement has been in place since 2004 and now includes the [[American Speech-Language-Hearing Association]] (United States), [[Speech-Language and Audiology Canada]], the Irish Association of Speech and Language Therapists, the New Zealand Speech-Language Therapists’ Association and the Royal College of Speech and Language (United Kingdom).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/certification/CredRecognitionAgreement.pdf#search=%22speech%22&lt;/ref&gt;

== Speech pathology courses in Australia ==

There are a number of university courses throughout Australia which offer entry-level training for speech pathologists.  Courses may be an undergraduate (Bachelor) or graduate entry (Masters) degree. 

The Federal Government of Australia, Department of Education and the Department of Employment recognises Speech Pathology Australia as the professional body representing speech pathologists in Australia and for their role in assessing qualifications required for practice in Australia.

Speech Pathology Australia has the further important role of accrediting university programs that offer training courses at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. The Competency Based Occupational Standards for Speech Pathologists (CBOS 2011) details the knowledge, skills and attributes required for graduate entry into the profession of speech pathology. All entry level degree programs in Australia, whether undergraduate or post graduate, are assessed to the same CBOS 2011 standards in the accreditation process. University speech pathology programs that are accredited by Speech Pathology Australia have demonstrated that their graduates have attained CBOS entry level competencies and are thus eligible for practising membership to Speech Pathology Australia.

Courses are invited to undergo initial accreditation or re-accreditation evaluation.  New courses are encouraged to complete accreditation prior to the graduation of their first cohort of students.  (See below for new courses who have initiated an accreditation evaluation).

[http://speechpathologyaustralia.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=190&amp;Itemid=84 Speech pathology courses holding accreditation with Speech Pathology Australia can be seen on the Association's website].

== Speech Pathology Week ==
The annual awareness week, Speech Pathology Week, is held in August to raise awareness of the speech pathology profession and the work done by speech pathologist with the more than 1.1 million Australians who have a communication or swallowing disorder that impacts on their daily life.

[http://speechpathologyaustralia.org.au/spa-news-and-events/speech-pathology-week Communication is a basic human right and Speech Pathology Week seeks to promote this fact].

== Book of the Year Awards ==
Since 2003, Speech Pathology Australia annually awards three Australian authors the “Best Book for Language and Literacy Development” in the following categories: 

Birth to 3 years - 3 to 5 years - 5 to 8 years - 8 to 10 years - Indigenous Children.

Each award is based on the book’s appeal to children, interactive quality and ability to assist speech pathologists and parents in communication and literacy development.

In [[literary criticism]] and [[rhetoric]], a '''tautology''' is a statement which repeats the same idea, using near-synonymous morphemes, words, or phrases, that is, "saying the same thing twice".&lt;ref name="Fowler"&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tautology and [[pleonasm]] are not consistently differentiated in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan Szymanek, "Remarks on Tautology in Word-Formation" in Laurie Bauer, ''et al.'', ''Semantics of Complex Words'', ''Studies in Morphology'' '''3''', 2015, {{isbn|3319141023}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XLkPBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA146 p. 142]&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[pleonasm]], it is often considered a fault of [[stylistics (linguistics)|style]] when unintentional. On the other hand, an intentional repetition may be an effective way to emphasize a thought, or help the listener or reader understand a point.&lt;ref name="bascom"&gt;John Bascom, ''Philosophy of Rhetoric'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y54CAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA241 p. 241]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sometimes [[tautology (logic)|logical tautologies]] like "Boys will be boys" are conflated with language tautologies, but in general, a rhetorical tautology is not inherently true.&lt;ref name="bascom"/&gt;

==Etymology==

The word was coined in Hellenistic Greek from ταὐτός ("the same") plus λόγος ("word/idea"), and transmitted through 3rd-century Latin ''tautologia'' and French ''tautologie''. It first appears in English in the 16th century. The use in the term [[tautology (logic)|logical tautology]] was introduced in English by [[Wittgenstein]] in 1919, perhaps following [[Auguste Comte]]'s usage in 1835.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 3rd edition, 2014, [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/198205 ''s.v.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
* "With malice toward none, with charity for all," from [[Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural address]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Ament, "Glossary of Rhetorical Terms" [https://mcl.as.uky.edu/glossary-rhetorical-terms]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==
Intentional repetition of meaning intends to amplify or emphasize a particular, usually significant, fact about what is being discussed. For example, a [[gift]] is, by definition, free of charge; using the phrase "free gift" might emphasize that there are no hidden conditions or [[fine print]], be it the expectation of money or reciprocation, or that the gift is being given by [[volition (psychology)|volition]].

This is related to the [[rhetoric]]al device of [[hendiadys]], where one concept is expressed through the use of two descriptive words or phrases.  For example, "goblets and gold" meaning wealth, or "this day and age" meaning the present time. Superficially these expressions may seem tautological, but they are stylistically sound because the repeated meaning is just a way to emphasize the same idea.

The use of tautologies is, however, usually unintentional. For example, the phrases "mental telepathy", "planned conspiracies", and "small dwarfs" imply that there are such things as "physical telepathy, spontaneous conspiracies, and giant dwarfs."&lt;ref name=Kallan&gt;{{cite book|last=Kallan|first=Richard|title=Armed Gunmen, True Facts, and Other Ridiculous Nonsense: A Compiled Compendium of Repetitive Redundancies|year=2005|publisher=Pantheon Books|isbn=0-375-42352-4|page=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[Parallelism (rhetoric)|Parallelism]] is not tautology, but rather a particular stylistic device. Much [[Old Testament]] [[poetry]] is based on [[Parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]]: the same thing said twice, but in slightly different ways (Fowler&lt;ref name="Fowler"/&gt; puts it as [[pleonasm]]). However, modern biblical study emphasizes that there are subtle distinctions and developments between the two lines, such that they are usually not truly the "same thing." Parallelism can be found wherever there is poetry in the Bible: [[Psalms]], the [[Books of the Prophets]], and in other areas as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20595">{{Linguistics}}
The '''theta-criterion''' (also named '''θ-criterion''') is a constraint on [[x-bar theory]] that was first proposed by {{harvs|txt|first=Noam|last=Chomsky|author-link=Noam Chomsky|year=1981}} as a rule within the system of principles of the [[government and binding theory]], called theta-theory (θ-theory).  As theta-theory is concerned with the distribution and assignment of [[theta roles|theta-roles]] (a.k.a. thematic roles), the theta-criterion describes the specific match between [[Argument (linguistics)|arguments]] and theta-roles (θ-roles) in [[logical form]] (LF):
{|
|-
|
{{Quote box
 |quote  = '''θ-criterion:''' ''Each argument bears one and only one θ-role, and each θ-role is assigned to one and only one argument.''
 |source = {{harv|Chomsky|1981|p=35}}
 |align  = center
 |fontsize=14
}}
|}

Being a constraint on x-bar theory, the criterion aims to parse out ill-formed sentences. Thus, if the number or categories of arguments in a sentence does not meet the theta-role assigner's requirement in any given sentence, that sentence will be deemed ungrammatical. {{harv|Carnie|2007|p=224}}. In other words, theta-criterion sorts sentences into grammatical and ungrammatical bins based on [[Selection (linguistics)|c-selection and s-selection]].

== Applied ==

=== Theta grid ===
A [[Theta role|theta-role]] is a status of [[thematic relation]] {{harv|Chomsky|1981|p=35}}. In other words, a theta-role describes the connection of meaning between a [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] or a [[verb]] and a [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituent]] selected by this predicate. The number, types and positions of theta-roles that a lexicon assigns is encoded in its lexical entry {{harv|Chomsky|1981|p=38}} and must be satisfied in syntactic structure following [[Projection Principle]].{{efn|Note that this doesn't mean that all theta-roles are obligatorily assigned. If a structural position that can be theta-marked is obligatory, then the theta-role assignment is also obligatory. Otherwise it is not {{harv|Chomsky|1981|p=40}}. See Transitivity section}} The [[Selection (linguistics)|selection]] of a constituent by a head based on meaning is called s-selection (semantic-selection) and those based on grammatical categories are called c-selection.{{efn|Such selection (theta-role assignment) is strictly local and only occurs between sister nodes. A lexical head assigns a theta-role to its complement, and the subject of this XP can receive a theta-role from the [[X']] including the head and its complement. The argument in subject position is called external argument, and the one in object position is called internal argument.{{harv|Williams|1981}} Adjuncts don't receive theta-roles so are not restricted by theta-criterion.}} {{harv|Sportiche|Koopman|Stabler|2014|p=141}} Such information can be expressed with a theta grid.

In the example below the verb 'love' has two theta-roles to assign: [[Thematic relation|agent]] (the entity who loves) and [[Thematic relation|theme]] (the entity being loved). In accordance with the theta-criterion, each theta-role must have its argument counterpart.
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-roles
!&lt;AGENT&gt;
!
!&lt;THEME&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;       |&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;      |&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|(1a)
|Megan
|loves
|Kevin
|-
| colspan="4" |{{harv|Carnie|2007|p=225 (22)}}
|}
In Example 1a, '''Megan''' and '''Kevin''' are the arguments that the verb assigns the agent and theme theta-roles to, respectively. Because there is a one-to-one mapping of argument to theta-role, the theta-criterion is satisfied and the sentence is deemed [[Grammaticality|grammatical]] {{harv|Carnie|2007|p=225}}. Below are two examples where the theta-criterion has not been fulfilled and are thus ungrammatical.
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-roles
!&lt;AGENT&gt;
!
!&lt;THEME&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;       |&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;      |&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|(1b)
|Megan
|loves
|
|-
| colspan="4" |{{harv|Carnie|2007|p=225 (24)}}
|}
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-roles
!&lt;AGENT&gt;
!
!&lt;THEME&gt;
!
|-
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;        |&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;      |&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|&lt;nowiki&gt;    |&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|(1c)
|Megan
|loves
|Jason
|Kevin
|-
| colspan="5" |{{harv|Carnie|2007|p=226 (26)}}
|}
Example 1b is ungrammatical (marked with '''*''') because there are more theta-roles available than there are arguments. The theta-role '''theme''' does not have an argument matched to it. On the other hand, in example (1c), there are more arguments than theta-roles. Both theta-roles are matched to arguments ('''Megan''' with '''Agent''' and '''Jason''' with '''theme'''), but there is an argument left without a corresponding theta-role (Kevin has no theta-role) {{harv|Carnie|2007}}. Thus for reasons of inequality in number between theta-roles and arguments, with either having more than the other, the result will be ungrammatical.

=== Consequence on movement ===
Since [[Trace (linguistics)|trace]] transmits theta-role, [[Syntactic movement|movements]] resulting in non-local relations between theta-role assigners and receivers in [[Transformational grammar|surface structure]] don't violate theta-criterion. This allows us to generate sentences with [[Raising (linguistics)|DP-raising]], head movement, [[wh-movement]], etc. However, if a phrase occupies a theta-position (complement or selected subject) in [[D-structure]], it can no longer move to another theta-position or it will receive two theta-roles {{harv|Chomsky|1981|p=46}}.

== Special cases ==

=== Transitivity ===

[[Verb]]s that can be either [[Transitive verb|transitive]] or [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]] at the first glance could present a problem for the theta-criterion. For a transitive verb, such as "hit," we assign the [[theta role|theta-role]]s agent and theme to the arguments, as shown in (2b), (2c), and (2d):
[[File:MaryArrived-D.jpg|thumb|(3c). The underlying representation of "Mary arrived." by a [[Concrete syntax tree|syntactic tree]].]]
[[File:MaryArrived-S.png|thumb|(3d). The surface representation of "Mary arrived." by a syntactic tree. "Mary" is projected to the spec-TP position by the [[Extended Projection Principle|extended projection principle]] triggered by the [+tense] tense morpheme.]]

| colspan="5" |(adapted from {{harv|Rice|1988|p=207}})
|}
The action of hitting here requires an animate subject, an [[Thematic relation|agent]], carry out the action. The [[Thematic relation|theme]] is then someone or something that undergoes the action.
For an intransitive verb, such as "arrive," we assign the theta-role theme to the sole argument, since "Mary" is the one the undergoes the action:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-roles
!&lt;THEME&gt;
!
!
|-
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;

|(3b)
|*Mary
|arrived
|an arrival.
|-
| colspan="4" |adapted from {{harv|Pesetsky &amp; Torrego|2002|p=22 (36a)}}
|}

The theta-criterion assigns the theta-role in the [[underlying structure]], as shown by (3c). The past-tense morpheme then requires a subject at the spec-TP position and forces the [[Syntactic movement|movement]] of "Mary," as shown by (3d).
A verb like "eat" can choose to take an object, as shown in (4):
{|
|-
|
 (4) a. ''John ate.''
     b. ''John ate something.''
     c. ''John ate a big lunch.''
         {{harv|Rice|1988|p=203 (1b-d)}}
|}
For this type of verb, the potential object is usually semantically limited and therefore can be inferred from the verb at a default value {{harv|Rice|1988|pp=203–4}}. For instance, for (4a), the listener/reader automatically assumes that John ate "something." What necessitates the object in (4c) is the distinction from the default meaning achieved by specifying what John ate {{harv|Rice|1988|p=208}}. As a result, this type of verbs can be treated the same as transitive verbs. The theta-roles of "agent" and "theme" can be assigned:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-roles
!&lt;AGENT&gt;
!
!(&lt;THEME&gt;)
|-
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;(|)&lt;/nowiki&gt;

In summary, by assigning the correct theta-roles, theta-criterion is able to tell the real intransitive verbs, such as "arrive" apart from verbs that can appear intransitive, such as "eat."

=== PRO and pro ===

==== PRO ====
[[PRO (linguistics)|PRO]] (pronounced 'big pro') is a null pronoun phrase that occurs in a position where it does not get case (or gets null case){{efn|There are exceptions. For example, Icelandic PRO is argued to bear normal cases {{harv|Sigurðsson|2008}}}} but takes the theta-role assigned by the [[Nonfinite verb|non-finite verb]] to its subject. PRO's meaning is determined by the precedent DP that [[Control (linguistics)|controls]] it {{harv|Carnie|2012|p=429}}. As theta criterion states that each argument is assigned a theta-role, and those theta-roles must consist of a syntactic category that the verb selects even when there is no overt subject. This is where PRO comes in to help satisfy theta-criterion by appearing as the null subject attaining the appropriate theta role {{harv|Camacho|2013}}.
Below is an example containing PRO in a sentence:

 (5) a. ''Jean&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is likely  [t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; to leave]''.
     b. ''Jean is reluctant [PRO to leave]''.
        {{harv|Carnie|2012|p=430 (1)}}

Example (5a) is a [[Raising (linguistics)|raising]] sentence,and in contrast, (5b) is a [[Control (linguistics)|control]] sentence, meaning it does not involve any DP [[Syntactic movement|movement]]. The PRO, which is a "null DP" is in the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] position of the [[Dependent clause|embedded clause]].

 (6) a. ''Jean wants Brian&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; [t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; to leave]''.
     b. ''Jean persuaded Brian [PRO to leave]''.
       {{harv|Carnie|2012|p=430 (4}}

Similarly, example (6a) is a raising-to-object sentence; "Brian" raises to the object position of the verb ''want.''{{efn|This movement won't cause ''Brian'' to get a theta-role from the verb ''want'' because 1) ''want'' only assigns a proposition role to its complement, and that role is already assigned to the clause ''Brain to leave''. 2) ''Brian'' in such cases moved to the specifier position of AgrOP rather than directly into the complement position of ''want''. {{harvtxt|Carnie|2007|page=411}}}} In contrast, (6b) is an object control sentence.{{harv|Carnie|2012|p=430}} The verb ''persuade'' has three theta-roles to assign: "agent" to ''Jean'', "theme" to ''Brian'', and "proposition" to the clause [''PRO to leave'']. There is no raising, but there is a PRO in the subject position of the embedded clause that takes the verb leave's only theta-role, "agent". Since Brian does not receive theta-role from ''leave'', it only bears one theta-role, nor does PRO receive a second theta-role from ''persuade''. Every argument only receives one theta-role, and every theta-role of the two predicates is assigned to only one argument. The sentence is thus grammatical.

==== pro ====
[[Empty category#pro (little pro)|pro]], also known as little pro, is an [[empty category]] that occurs in a subject or object position of a [[finite clause]] (finite clauses must contain a verb which shows tense) in languages like Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, and some Arabic dialects ({{harvnb|Jaeggli|Safir|1989}}; {{harvnb|Rizzi|1986}}). pro differs from PRO in that it contains [[Case (linguistics)|case]]. The meaning of pro is determined not by its [[Antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]] but by verb [[Agreement (grammar)|agreement]] in the sentence. The DP is 'dropped' from a sentence if its reference can be recovered from the context.{{harv|Carnie|2012|p=429}} For example:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"

|-
| colspan="5" |'A good psychoanalyst can return people to themselves'.
|-
| colspan="5" |(Adapted from {{harvtxt|Rizzi|1986|page=504 (11b)}})
|}
The verb ''restituire'' 'give back' assigns three theta-roles, but there are only two overt arguments in the sentence. It ultimately satisfies theta-criterion because the role, theme, is taken by a pro, whose existence can be proved by the properly [[Binding (linguistics)|bound]] reflexive pronoun ''se stessi''. Compare (7a) with (7b) below:
 (7b) *''Un bravo psicanalista può dare aiuto a  se stessi''.
       A  good  psychoanalyst can give help  to oneself.
       'A good psychoanalyst can give help to themselves'.
      (Adapted from {{harvtxt|Rizzi|1986|page=504 (13b)}})
When the reflexive pronoun ''se stessi'' 'themselves' doesn't have a proper [[Antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]] to co-refer to, the sentence can't be grammatical. This indicates that in (7a) ''se stessi'' must have a proper antecedent in the sentence—the pro that takes the theme role.

=== Cognate object ===
[[Cognate object]]s are nominal complements of their cognate verbs that are normally [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]]. For example,
 (8) ''John died a gruesome death.''
      {{harv|Jones|1988|p=89 (1a)}}
Such a structure posed a problem for theta-criterion because normally the verb assigns only one theta-role, theme, which is already taken by the [[Determiner phrase|DP]], "John." The sentence should be thus predicted ill-formed. To explain the phenomenon, one way is to re-categorize such a verb as "die" so as to change the way it assigns theta-roles. For that purpose, (8) can be interpreted as follows:
 (9) ''John met a gruesome death.''
      {{harv|Jones|1988|p=91 (5a)}}
Or John ''underwent'' a gruesome death. If the verb "die" is essentially similar to the operation-verb "meet," the cognate objects should be assigned a theta-role—one restricted to the nominal form of the verb head {{harv|Jones|1988}}. In other words, "die" is now classified as a potentially transitive verb, assigning two theta-roles, agent to "John" and theme to "a gruesome death." Such a possibility is falsified, however, because cognate object constructions cannot be passivized {{harv|Jones|1988}}.
[[File:JohnDiedAGruesomeDeath.jpg|thumb|(11c) Tree structure of (11a) "John died a gruesome death." The adjunct phrase is highlighted in yellow. Substituting the adjunct DP "a gruesome death" with the [[adverbial phrase]] "gruesomely" will derive (11b).]]
 (10) a. ''A gruesome death was met by John.''
      b. ''*A gruesome death was died by John.''
      {{harv|Jones|1988|p=91 (6a), p=92 (11a)}}
As we can no longer consider verbs that take cognate objects the same as potentially transitive verbs, {{harvtxt|Jones|1988}} argues, based on the framework of {{harvtxt|Zubizarreta|1982}}, that cognate objects are [[Adjunct (grammar)|adjuncts]] rather than [[Argument (grammar)|arguments]], having the same meaning and structure as the manner [[adverb]]s in (12b).
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-role

|John
|died
|gruesomely.
|-
| colspan="4" |{{harvtxt|Jones|1988|p=89 (1a), p. 93 (12a)}}
|}

Such an analysis restores cognate objects to the group of arguments satisfying the theta-criterion, as adjuncts, by definition, are not counted as arguments and therefore need not be restricted by theta criterion. The tree form (11c) shows the adjunct DP in its relative position.

=== Deverbal nouns ===

[[Deverbal noun]]s are derived from verbs and thus assign theta-roles as their verb stems do. For example,

 (12) (i) ''the barbarians' destruction of Rome''
     (ii) ''Rome's destruction (by the barbarians)''
    (iii) ''the destruction of Rome (by the barbarians)''
     (iv) ''*the barbarian's destruction''
    ({{harv|Chomsky|1981|p=104 (7)}})

According to {{harvtxt|Chomsky|1981|p=104}}, the constructions in (10) are analogous to "the barbarians destroyed Rome" and ''destruction'' needs to assign theta-roles in line with theta-criterion. It assigns "agent" to ''the barbarians'' and "theme" to ''Rome'' so (i) is fine. The verb "destroy" alone doesn't obligatorily assign theta-role to its subject so (ii) and (iii) is well-formed, too. However, "destroy" must assign a "theme", so (iv) is ruled out.

== Alternative approaches ==
Theta-criterion experienced its golden age in the 1980s when people discussed its application to various languages and structures and developed many other theories from it. However, after the [[minimalist program]] challenged some cornerstones of government and binding theory, people started to question the validity of this criterion, especially the number of theta-roles allowed to be taken by an argument. Hornstein and Boeckx, for example, proposed that there is no upper limit on the number of theta-roles an argument can receive during derivation. In their theory, the function of selecting correct number of arguments is shouldered by [[case theory]], and theta-roles are just features on verbs that needs to be checked {{harv|Hornstein|1999}}.

'''Tutnese''' or '''Double Dutch''' is a [[language game]] primarily used in [[English language|English]], although the rules can be easily modified to apply to almost any language. Tutnese is usually used by [[child]]ren, who use it to converse in privacy from [[adult]]s; by members of historically [[Marginalization|marginalized]] minority groups for the same reason when in the presence of authority figures such as police ("pupolulisus" or "pizolizice"); or simply for amusement and humor.

==Language rules==

In Tutnese, [[vowel]]s are pronounced normally, but each [[consonant]] is replaced with a syllable from the following table:

{| class="wikitable"
! Letter !! Possible syllables !! Letter !! Possible syllables !! Letter !! Possible syllables
|-
| B || Bub || K || Kuck || S || Sus
|-
| C || Cash, coch || L || Lul || T || Tut
|-
| D || Dud || M || Mum || V || Vuv
|-
| F || Fuf, Fud || N || Nun || W || Wack, Wash
|-
| G || Gug || P || Pub, pup || X || Ex, xux
|-
| H || Hash, hutch || Q || Quack, queue || Y || Yub, yuck
|-
| J || Jay, jug || R || Rug, rur || Z || Zub, zug
|}

Double letters in a word, rather than being repeated, are preceded by the syllable ''squa'' to indicate doubling. For doubled vowels, the prefix becomes ''squat'' instead—thus, ''OO'' would be spoken as ''squat-oh''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roselli|first1=Greig|title=King Tut Language|url=http://www.stonesoferasmus.com/2009/09/king-tut-language.html|website=www.stoneofmerasmus.com|publisher=Greig Roselli|accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Word Example: "Tree" becomes "Tutrugsquatee". 
Sentence Example: "I took a walk to the park yesterday" becomes "I tutsquatohkuck a wackalulkuck tuto tuthashe pubarugkuck yubesustuterugdudayub".

While spaces between words are always ignored, at least one "dialect" requires that the first syllable of the name of any given punctuation mark be spoken, thus a [[full stop]] (period) is 'Per', a question mark is 'Que' ('Kway' or 'Kay', varies), and a comma is 'Com'.

==History==

This game appears to have been invented and used by black slaves in the American south, to teach spelling and conceal what they said, at a time when literacy among slaves was forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tutlanguage.com/pages/amSpeech.html Tut Language — American Speech]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maya Angelou]] mentions learning Tutnese as a child in the first volume of her autobiography, ''[[I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings]]''.  She and her friend Louise "spent tedious hours teaching ourselves the Tut language.  You (yack oh you) know (kack nug oh wug) what (wack hash a tut).  Since all the other children spoke Pig Latin, we were superior because Tut was hard to speak and even harder to understand."&lt;ref&gt;Angelou, Maya. (1969) I know why the caged bird sings.  New York: Bantam Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a version used in some parts of the US called Yuckish or Yukkish, which uses more or less the same constructs.

'''Universal pragmatics''' ('''UP'''), more recently placed under the heading of '''formal pragmatics''', is the philosophical study of the necessary conditions for reaching an [[understanding]] through [[communication]]. The [[philosopher]] [[Jürgen Habermas]] coined the term in his essay "What is Universal Pragmatics?"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Communication and the Evolution of Society|last=Habermas|first=Jürgen|publisher=Beacon Press.|year=1979|isbn=|location=Toronto|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he suggests that human [[competition]], conflict, and strategic action are attempts to achieve understanding that have failed because of [[modal logic|modal]] confusions.  The implication is that coming to terms with how people understand or misunderstand one another could lead to a reduction of social [[Group conflict|conflict]].

By coming to an "understanding," he means at the very least, when two or more [[social actor]]s share the same [[Meaning (linguistic)|meanings]] about certain words or phrases; and at the very most, when these actors are confident that those meanings fit relevant social [[expectation (epistemic)|expectation]]s (or a "mutually recognized [[normative background]]").&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For Habermas, the [[Objective (goal)|goal]] of coming to an understanding is "intersubjective mutuality ... shared knowledge, mutual [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]], and accord with one another".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In other words, the underlying goal of coming to an understanding would help to foster the enlightenment, consensus, and good will necessary for establishing socially beneficial norms. Habermas' goal is not primarily for subjective feeling alone, but for development of shared (intersubjective) norms which in turn establish the [[Coordination game|social coordination]] needed for practical action in pursuit of shared and individual objectives (a form of action termed "[[communicative action]]").

As an interdisciplinary subject, universal pragmatics draws upon material from a large number of fields, from [[pragmatics]], [[semantics]], [[semiotics]], [[informal logic]], and the [[philosophy of language]], through [[social philosophy]], [[sociology]], and [[symbolic interactionism]], to [[ethics]], especially [[discourse ethics]], and on to [[epistemology]] and the [[philosophy of mind]].

==History==
Universal pragmatics (UP) seeks to overcome three dichotomies:  the dichotomy between ''body and mind'', between ''theory and practice'', and between ''[[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[continental philosophy]]''. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} It is part of a larger project to rethink the relationship between philosophy and the individual [[science]]s during a period of social crisis. The project is within the tradition of [[Critical Theory]], a program that traces back to the work of [[Max Horkheimer]].

The term "universal pragmatics" includes two different traditions that Habermas and his collaborator, colleague, and friend [[Karl-Otto Apel]] have attempted to reconcile. On the one hand, ideas are drawn from the tradition of [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], wherein words and concepts are regarded as universally valid [[Idealization (science philosophy)|idealizations]] of shared meanings. And, on the other hand, inspiration is drawn from the American [[Pragmatism|Pragmatist]] tradition (feat. [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[George Herbert Mead]], [[Charles W. Morris]]), for whom words are usually arbitrary signs devoid of intrinsic meaning, and whose function is to denote the things and processes in the objective world that surrounds the speakers. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

UP shares with [[speech act]] theory, semiotics, and [[linguistics]] an interest in the details of language use and communicative action. However, unlike those fields, it insists on a difference between the linguistic data that we ''observe'' in the '[[Analysis|analytic]]' mode, and the ''[[rational reconstruction]] of the rules of symbol systems'' that each reader/listener possesses intuitively when interpreting strings of words. In this sense, it is an examination of the two ways that language usage can be analyzed: as an object of scientific investigation, and as a 'rational reconstruction' of intuitive linguistic 'know-how'.

==Goals and methods==
Universal pragmatics is associated with the philosophical method of ''rational reconstruction''.

The basic concern in universal pragmatics is ''utterances'' (or ''[[speech acts]]'') in general.  This is in contrast to most other fields of linguistics, which tend to be more specialized, focusing exclusively on very specific sorts of utterances such as ''sentences'' (which in turn are made up of ''[[word]]s'', ''[[morpheme]]s'', and ''[[phoneme]]s'').

For Habermas, the most significant difference between a sentence and an utterance is in that sentences are judged according to how well they make sense ''grammatically'', while utterances are judged according to their ''communicative validity'' (see section 1). (1979:31)

Universal pragmatics is also distinct from the field of [[sociolinguistics]], because universal pragmatics is only interested in the meanings of utterances ''if they have to do with claims about truth or rightness'', while sociolinguistics is interested in all utterances in their social contexts. (1979:31, 33)

==Three aspects of universal pragmatics==
There are three ways to evaluate an utterance, according to UP. There are ''theories that deal with elementary propositions'', ''theories of first-person sentences'', and ''theories of speech acts''.

A theory of elementary propositions investigates those things in the real world that are being ''[[Theory of reference|reference]]d'' by an utterance, and the things that are implied by an [[utterance]], or ''predicate'' it. For example, the utterance "The first [[Prime Minister]] of Canada" refers to a man who went by the name of Sir [[John A. Macdonald]]. And when a speaker delivers the utterance, "My [[husband]] is a [[lawyer]]", it implies that the speaker is married to a man.

A theory of first-person sentences examines the expression of the ''intentions'' of the actor(s) through language and in the first-person.

Finally, a theory of speech acts examines the setting of standards for interpersonal relations through language. The basic goal for speech act theory is to explain how and when utterances in general are ''[[performative]]''. (1979:34) Central to the notion of speech acts are the ideas of [[illocutionary force]] and [[Perlocutionary act|perlocutionary force]], both terms coined by philosopher [[J.L. Austin]]. ''Illocutionary force'' describes the intent of the speaker, while ''perlocutionary force'' means ''the effect an utterance has in the world'', or more specifically, the effect on others.

A performative utterance is a sentence where an action being performed is done by the utterance itself. For example: "I inform you that you have a moustache", or "I promise you I will not burn down the house". In these cases, the words are also taken as significant actions: the act of informing and promising (respectively).

Habermas adds to this the observation that speech acts can either succeed or fail, depending on whether or not they succeed on ''[[Influence (sociology)|influencing]]'' another person in the intended way. (1979:35)

This last method of evaluation—the theory of speech acts—is the domain that Habermas is most interested in developing as a ''theory of communicative action''.

==Communicative action==

There are a number of ways to approach Habermas's project of developing a formal pragmatic analysis of communication. Because Habermas developed it in order to have a normative and philosophical foundation for his critical social theory, most of the inroads into formal pragmatics start from sociology, specifically with what is called [[action theory (sociology)|action theory]]. Action theory concerns the nature of human action, especially the manner in which collective actions are coordinated in a functioning society.

The coordination and integration of social action has been explained in many ways by many theories. [[Rational choice theory]] and [[game theory]] are two examples, which describe the integration of individuals into social groups by detailing the complex manner in which individuals motivated only by self-interest will form mutually beneficial and cooperative social arrangements. In contrast to these, Habermas has formulated a theory of ''communicative action''. (Habermas 1984; 1987) This theory and the project of developing a formal pragmatic analysis of communication are inseparable.

Habermas makes a series of distinctions in the service of explaining [[social action]]. The first major differentiation he makes is between two social realms, ''the system'' and ''the [[lifeworld]]''. These designate two distinct modes of [[social integration]]:
* The kind of social integration accomplished in the system is accomplished through ''the functional integration of the consequences of actions''. It bypasses the consciousness of individuals and does not depend upon their being oriented towards acting collectively. Economic and industrial systems are great examples, often producing complex forms of social integration and interdependence despite the openly competitive orientations of individuals.
* The social integration accomplished in the lifeworld, by contrast, depends upon ''the coordination of action plans and the conscious action-orientations of individuals''. It relies on processes of human interaction involving symbolic and cultural forms of meaning. More specifically, as Habermas maintains, the coordination of the lifeworld is accomplished through communicative action.

Thus, communicative action is an indispensable facet of [[society]]. It is at the heart of the lifeworld and is, Habermas claims, responsible for accomplishing several fundamental social functions: reaching understanding, cultural reproduction, coordinating action-plans, and [[socialization|socializing]] individuals.

However, Habermas is quick to note, different modes of interaction can (in some ways) facilitate these social functions and achieve integration within the lifeworld. This points towards the second key distinction Habermas makes, which differentiates ''communicative action'' from ''strategic action''. The coordination of action plans, which constitutes the social integration of the lifeworld, can be accomplished either through consensus or influence.

Strategic action is action oriented towards success, while communicative action is action oriented towards understanding. Both involve the symbolic resources of the lifeworld and occur primarily by way of linguistic interaction. On the one hand, actors employing communicative actions draw on the uniquely impelling force of mutual understanding to align the orientation of their action plans. It is this subtle but insistent binding force of communicative interactions that opens the door to an understanding of their meanings. On the other hand, actors employing strategic actions do not exploit the potential of communication that resides in the mutual recognition of a shared action-oriented understanding. Instead strategic actors relate to others with no intention of reaching consensus or mutual understanding, but only the intention of accomplishing pre-determined ends unrelated to reaching an understanding. Strategic action often involves the use of communicative actions to achieve the isolated intentions of individuals, manipulating shared understanding in the service of private interests. Thus, Habermas claims, strategic action is parasitic on communicative action, which means communicative action is the primary mode of linguistic interaction. Reaching a reciprocally defined understanding is communication's basic function.

Keeping in mind this delineation of the object domain, the formal pragmatics of communication can be more readily laid out. The essential insight has already been mentioned, which is that communication is responsible for irreplaceable modes of social integration, and this is accomplished through the unique binding force of a shared understanding. This is, in a sense, the pragmatic piece of formal pragmatics: communication does something in the world. What needs to be explained are the conditions for the possibility of what communication already does. This is, in a sense, the formal piece of formal pragmatics: a rational reconstruction of the deep generative structures that are the universal conditions for the possibility of a binding and compelling mutual understanding.

From here, Habermas heads the analysis in two directions. In one direction is a kind of [[linguistic analysis]] (of speech acts), which can be placed under the heading of the validity dimensions of communication. The other direction entails a categorization of the idealized presuppositions of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCarthy|first=T|date=1984|title=Reason and the Rationalization of Society|url=|journal=The Theory of Communicative Action|volume=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communicative competence===

Habermas argues that when speakers are communicating successfully, they will have to defend their meaning by using these four claims.

# That they have ''uttered something'' understandably — or ''their statements are intelligible'';
# That they have given other people ''something to understand'' — or are speaking ''something true'';
# That ''the speaker'' is therefore understandable — or their ''intentions are recognized and appreciated'' for what they are; and,
# That they have come to an understanding ''with another person'' — or, they have used ''words that both actors can agree upon''. (1979:4)

Habermas is emphatic that these claims are universal—no human communication oriented at achieving mutual understanding could possibly fail to raise all of these validity claims.  Additionally, to illustrate that all other forms of communication are derived from that which is oriented toward mutual understanding, he argues that there are no other kinds of validity claims whatsoever.  This is important, because it is the basis of Habermas' critique of [[postmodernism]].

The fundamental orientation toward mutual understanding is at the heart of universal pragmatics, as Habermas explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The task of universal pragmatics is to identify and reconstruct universal conditions of possible mutual understanding... other forms of social action—for example, conflict, competition, strategic action in general—are derivatives of action oriented toward reaching understanding.  Furthermore, since language is the specific medium of reaching understanding at the sociocultural stage of evolution, I want to go a step further and single out explicit speech actions from other forms of communicative action."&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, 1976, "What is universal pragmatics?" p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Any meaning that meets the above criteria, and is recognized by another as meeting the criteria, is considered "''vindicated''" or ''communicatively competent''.

In order for anyone to speak validly — and therefore, to have his or her comments vindicated, and therefore reach a genuine consensus and understanding — Habermas notes that a few more fundamental commitments are required. First, he notes, actors ''have to treat this formulation of validity so seriously that it might be a precondition for any communication at all''. Second, he asserts that ''all actors must believe that their claims are able to meet these standards of validity''. And third, he insists that there must be a common conviction among actors that all validity claims ''are either already vindicated or could be vindicated''.

===Examining the validity of speech===

Habermas claims that communication rests upon a non-egoistic understanding of the world, which is an idea he borrowed from thinkers like [[Jean Piaget]]. A subject capable of a de-centered understanding can take up three fundamentally different attitudes to the world. Habermas refers to such attitudes as ''dimensions of validity''. Specifically, this means individuals can recognize different standards for validity—i.e., that the validation of an [[empirical]] truth claim requires different methods and procedures than the validation of subjective truthfulness, and that both of those require different methods and procedures of validation than claims to normative rightness.

These dimensions of validity can be summarized as claims to ''truth (IT), truthfulness (I),'' and ''rightness (WE)''. So the ability to differentiate between the attitudes (and their respective "worlds") mentioned above should be understood as an ability to distinguish between types of validity claims.

M. Cooke provided the only book length treatment of Habermas's [[communication theory]]. Cooke explains:
:"when we adopt an objectifying attitude we relate, in the first instance to the objective world of facts and existing states of affairs [IT]; when we adopt a norm-conformative attitude we relate, in the first instance, to the social world of normatively regulated interactions [WE]; when we adopt an expressive attitude we relate, in the first instance to the subjective world of inner [[experience]] [I]". (Cooke 1994)

This is fundamental to Habermas's analysis of communication. He maintains that the performance of any speech act necessarily makes reference to these dimensions of validity, by raising at least three validity claims.

One way to grasp this idea is to take an inventory of the ways in which an attempt at communication can misfire, the ways a speech act can fail. A hearer may reject the offering of a speech act on the grounds that it is invalid because it:
# presupposes or explicates states of affairs which are not the case (IT);
# does not conform to accepted normative expectations (WE);
# raises doubts about the intentions or sincerity of the speaker (I).

Of course, from this it follows that a hearer who accepts the offering of a speech act does so on the grounds that it is valid because it:
# presupposes or explicates states of affairs that are true (IT);
# conforms to accepted normative expectations (WE);
# raises no doubts concerning the intentions or sincerity of the speaker (I).

This means that when engaging in communication the speaker and hearer are inescapably oriented to the validity of what is said. A speech act can be understood as an offering, the success or failure of which depends upon the hearer's response of either accepting or rejecting the validity claims it raises. The three dimensions of validity pointed out above are implicated in any attempt at communication.

Thus, communication relies on its being embedded within relations to various dimensions of validity. Any and every speech act is infused with inter-subjectively recognized claims to be valid. This implicitly ties communication to argumentation and various [[discourse|discursive]] procedures for the redemption of validity claims. This is true because to raise a validity claim in communication is to simultaneously imply that one is able to show, if challenged, that one's claim is justified. Communication is possible because speakers are accountable for the validity of what they say. This assumption of responsibility on the part of the speaker is described by Habermas as a ''"warranty"'', because in most cases the validity claims raised during communication are taken as [[wikt:justify|justified]], and communication proceeds on that basis. Similarly, the hearer is accountable for the stance he or she takes up in relation to the validity claims raised by the speaker. Both speaker and hearer are bound to the validity claims raised by the utterances they share during communication. They are bound by the weak obligations inherent in pursuing actions oriented towards reaching an understanding. Habermas would claim that this obligation is a rational one:

:"With every speech act, by virtue of the validity claims it raises, the speaker enters into an interpersonal relationship of mutual obligation with the hearer: The speaker is obliged to support her claims with reasons, if challenged, and the hearer is obliged to accept a claim unless he has good reason not to do so. The obligation in question is, in the first instance, not a moral one but a rational one -- the penalty of failure to fulfill it is the charge not of immorality but of irrationality -- although clearly the two will often overlap" (Cooke, 1994).

This begins to point towards the idea of [[communicative rationality]], which is the potential for [[rationality]] that is implicit in the validity basis of everyday communication, the shape of reason that can be extracted from Habermas's formal-pragmatic analyses.

:"The modern -- decentered -- understanding of the world has opened up different dimensions of validity; to the extent that each dimension of validity has its own standards of truth and falsity and its own modes of justification for determining these, one may say that what has been opened up are dimensions of rationality" (Cooke, 1994).

However, before the idea of communicative rationality can be described, the other direction of Habermas's formal pragmatic analyses of communication needs to be explained. This direction looks towards the idealized presuppositions of communication.

===Ideal presuppositions of communication===

When individuals pursue actions oriented towards reaching an understanding, the speech acts they exchange take on the weight of a mutually recognized validity. This means each actor involved in communication takes the other as [[accountable]] for what they have said, which implies that good reasons could be given by all to justify the validity of the understanding that is being achieved. Again, in most situations the redemption of validity claims is not an explicit undertaking (except in ''discourses'', see below). Instead, each actor issues a ''"warranty"'' of accountability to the other, which only needs to be redeemed if certain validity claims are thrown into question. This suggests that the validity claims raised in every communicative interaction implicitly tie communication to argumentation.

It is here that the idealized presuppositions of communication arise. Habermas claims that all forms of argumentation, even implicit and rudimentary ones, rest upon certain "idealizing suppositions," which are rooted in the very structures of action oriented towards understanding. These "strong idealizations" are always understood as at least approximately satisfied by participants in situations where argumentation (and communication) is thought to be taking place. Thus, when during communication it is discovered that the belief that these presuppositions are satisfied is not justified it is always taken as problematic. As a result, steps are usually taken to reestablish and maintain the belief that they are approximately satisfied, or communication is simply called off.

# The most basic of these idealized presuppositions is the presupposition that ''participants in communicative exchange are using the same linguistic expressions in the same way''. This is an obvious but interesting point, which clearly illustrates what an idealized presupposition is. It is a presupposition because communication would not proceed if those involved did not think it was at least approximately satisfied (in this case that a shared language was being used). It is idealized because no matter how closely it is approximated it is always [[counterfactual thinking|counterfactual]] (because, in this case, the fact is that all meanings are to some degree personally defined).
# Another, basic idealized presupposition of argumentation is the presupposition that ''no relevant argument is [[self-censorship|suppressed]] or excluded by the participants''.
# Another is the presupposition that ''no [[persuasion|persuasive]] force except that of the better argument is exerted''.
# There is also the presupposition that ''all the participants are motivated only by a concern for the better argument''.
# There is the presupposition of attributing a ''context-transcending significance to validity claims''. This presupposition is controversial but important (and becomes expanded and clarified in the presuppositions of discourse, see below). The idea is that participants in communication instill their claims with a validity that is understood to have significance beyond the specific context of their agreement.
# The presupposition that ''no validity claim is exempt in principle from critical evaluation in argumentation'';
# The presupposition that ''everyone capable of speech and action is entitled to participate'', and everyone is equally entitled to introduce new topics or express attitudes needs or desires.

In sum, all these presuppositions must be assumed to be approximately satisfied in any situation of communication, despite their being necessarily counterfactual. Habermas refers to the positing of these idealized presuppositions as the "simultaneously unavoidable and trivial accomplishments that sustain communicative action and argumentation".

Habermas calls ''discourses'' those forms of communication that come sufficiently close to actually satisfying these presuppositions. Discourses often occur within [[institutional]]ized forms of argumentation that self-reflectively refine their procedures of communication, and as a result, have a more rigorous set of presuppositions in addition to the ones listed above.

A striking feature of discourse is that validity claims tend to be explicitly thematized and there is the presupposition that all possible [[interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]]s would agree to the universal validity of the conclusions reached. Habermas especially highlights this in what he calls ''theoretical discourses'' and ''practical discourses''. These are tied directly to two of the three dimensions of validity discussed above: theoretical discourse being concerned with validity claims thematized regarding objective states of affairs (IT); practical discourse being concerned with validity claims thematized concerning the rightness of norms governing social interactions (WE).

Habermas understands presupposition (5) to be responsible for generating the self-understanding and continuation of theoretical and practical discourses. Presupposition (5) points out that the validity of an understanding reached in theoretical or practical discourse, concerning some factual knowledge or normative principle, is always expanded beyond the immediate context in which it is achieved. The idea is that participants in discourses such as these presuppose that any understanding reached could attain universal [[Consensus|agreement]] concerning its universal validity if these discourses could be relieved of the constraints of time and space. This idealized presupposition directs discourses concerning truth and normative certainty beyond the contingencies of specific communicative situations and towards the idealized achievements of universal consensus and universal validity. It is a rational reconstruction of the conditions for the possibility of earnest discourses concerning facts and norms. Recall that, for Habermas, rational reconstructions aim at offering the most acceptable account of what allows for the competencies already mastered by a wide range of subjects. In order for discourse to proceed, the existence of [[fact]]s and [[Norm (philosophy)|norms]] must be presupposed, yet the certainty of an absolute [[knowledge]] of them must be, in a sense, postponed.

Striking a Piagetian and [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]]an chord, Habermas understands the deep structures of collective inquiry as [[Developmental psychology|development]]al. Thus, the presupposition shared by individuals involved in discourse is taken to reflect this. The pursuit of truth and normative certainty is taken to be motivated and grounded, not in some objective or social world that is treated as a "given", but rather in a learning process. Indeed, Habermas himself is always careful to formulate his work as a [[research project]], open to refinement.

In any case, reconstructing the presuppositions and validity dimensions inherent to communication is valuable because it brings into relief the inescapable foundations of everyday practices. Communicative action and the rudimentary forms of argumentation that orient the greater part of human interaction cannot be left behind. By reconstructing the deep structures of these Habermas has discovered a seed of rationality planted in the very heart of the lifeworld. Everyday practices, which are common enough to be trivial, such as reaching an understanding with another, or contesting the reasons for pursuing a course of action, contain an implicit and idealized rationality.

In other words, communication is always somewhat rational. Communication could not occur if the participants thought that the speech acts exchanged did not carry the weight of a validity for which those participating could be held accountable. Nor would anyone feel that a conclusion was justified if it was achieved by any other means than the uncoerced force of the better argument. Nor could the specialized discourses of [[law]], science and [[morality]] continue if the progress of knowledge and insight was denied in favor of [[relativism]].

====Criticism====
It is a question how appropriate it is to speak of "communication" tenselessly, and of "everyday practices" as though they cut across all times and cultures. That they do cannot be assumed, and [[anthropology]] provides evidence of significant difference. It is possible to ignore these facts by limiting the scope of universal pragmatics to current forms of discourse, but this runs the risk of contradicting Habermas's own demand for (5). Moreover, the initial unease with the classical and [[Liberalism|liberal]] views of rationality had to do precisely with their ahistorical character and refusal, or perhaps inability, to acknowledge their own origins in circumstances of the day. Their veneer of false universality torn off by the likes of [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], it remains to be seen whether "universal" pragmatics can stand up to the same challenges posed by [[deconstruction]] and [[skepticism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10297">'''Vocal music''' is a type of music performed by one or more singers, either with [[musical instruments|instrumental]] accompaniment, or without instrumental accompaniment ([[a cappella]]), in which [[singing]] provides the main focus of the piece. Music which employs singing but does not feature it prominently is generally considered instrumental music (e.g. the wordless women's choir in the final movement of [[Gustav Holst|Holst]]'s [[The Planets]]) as is music without singing. Music without any non-vocal instrumental accompaniment is referred to as ''[[a cappella]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Titze, I. R. (2008). The human instrument. Sci.Am. 298 (1):94-101. PM 18225701&lt;/ref&gt;

Vocal music typically features sung words called [[lyrics]], although there are notable examples of vocal music that are performed using non-linguistic syllables, sounds, or noises, sometimes as musical [[onomatopoeia]]. A short piece of vocal music with lyrics is broadly termed a song.

Vocal music is probably the oldest form of music, since it does not require any instrument besides the [[human voice]]. All musical [[culture]]s have some form of vocal music.

==Vocal music without lyrics==
{{main|Non-lexical vocables in music}}

===World traditions===
* [[Indian classical music]] is based on a rich vocal tradition, wherein even instruments are evaluated on their ability to follow the human voice, imitate it, or recreate the same expressions.
* Elaborate untexted vocal improvisation was and still is an important element in [[Music of Turkey|Turkish]] and [[Middle Eastern]] music traditions. Such music existed prior to the 13th century and the [[First Crusade]] into Palestine and the city of [[Jerusalem]], possibly even before the year 900.
* The modern descendants of the ancient [[ǃKung people|Kung]] tribes and clans of Southern Africa utilize similar traditional music techniques.
* A form of improvisation known as [[thillana]] is a very important feature of [[Carnatic music]] from South India.
* [[Tuvans|Tuvan]] [[Overtone singing|throat singing]] often features wordless and improvised song. The [[sygyt]] technique is a particularly good example of this.
* The [[Anglo-Saxon]] and [[Gaels|Gaelic]] communities.
* [[Hasidic Jews]] use a form of voice improvisation called [[nigunim]].  This consists of wordless tunes vocalized with sounds such as "Bim-bim-bam" or "Ai-yai-yai!" often accompanied by rhythmic clapping and drumming on the table.
* [[Puirt a beul]], also known as "Mouth Music", is a Scottish vocal technique imitating the sounds of bagpipes, fiddles, and other instruments used in traditional Scottish music.  It was popularized in North America by [[Scottish Americans|Scottish immigrants]], and has been incorporated into many forms of American music from [[Traditional music|roots music]] to [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]].
* The [[Cante Alentejano]] is just based on vocal music. It's one of two Portuguese music traditions part of the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]], the other being  [[Fado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00011&amp;RL=01007|title= Cante Alentejano, polyphonic singing from Alentejo, southern Portugal|accessdate= November 3, 2015|work= unesco.org|publisher= [[UNESCO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00011&amp;RL=00563|title= Fado, urban popular song of Portugal|accessdate= November 3, 2015|work= unesco.org|publisher= [[UNESCO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European classical vocal music===
[[Solfege]], a vocalized musical [[scale (music)|scale]], assigns various syllables such as ‘‘Do-Re-Mi‘‘ to each note. A variety of similar tools are found in   
traditional [[Music of India|Indian music]], and [[scat singing]] of jazz.

===Jazz and popular music===
[[Hip hop music]] has a very distinct form of vocal percussion known as [[beatboxing]]. It involves creating beats, rhythms, and [[scratching]].

The singer of the Icelandic group [[Sigur Rós]], [[Jón Þór Birgisson]], often uses vocals without words, as does Icelandic singer/songwriter, [[Björk]]. Her album [[Medúlla (album)|Medúlla]] is composed entirely of processed and acoustic vocal music, including [[beatboxing]], [[choral]] arrangements, and [[Overtone singing|throat singing]].

Singer [[Bobby McFerrin]] has recorded a number of albums using only his voice and body, sometimes consisting of a texted melody supported by untexted vocalizations.

==Vocal music with lyrics==

===Songs===
:''See [[:Category:Song forms]] for short forms of music with sung words.''

===Extended techniques that involve lyrics===
The [[Second Viennese School]], especially [[Alban Berg]] and [[Arnold Schoenberg]], pioneered a technique called [[Sprechstimme]] in which singers are half-talk, half-sing, and only approximate pitches.
