'''''A Course of Pure Mathematics''''' is a classic textbook in introductory [[mathematical analysis]], written by [[G. H. Hardy]]. It is recommended for people studying calculus. First published in 1908, it went through ten editions (up to 1952) and several reprints. It is now out of copyright in UK and is downloadable from various internet web sites. It remains one of the most popular books on pure mathematics.

==Contents==
The book contains a large number of descriptive and study materials together with a number of difficult problems with regards to number theory analysis. The book is organized into the following chapters, with each chapter further divided.

I. REAL VARIABLES

II. FUNCTIONS OF REAL VARIABLES

III COMPLEX NUMBERS

IV LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A POSITIVE INTEGRAL VARIABLE

V LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE. CONTINUOUS AND DISCONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS

VI DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS

VII ADDITIONAL THEOREMS IN THE DIFFERENTIAL AND INTEGRAL CALCULUS

VIII THE CONVERGENCE OF INFINITE SERIES AND INFINITE INTEGRALS

IX THE LOGARITHMIC, EXPONENTIAL AND CIRCULAR FUNCTIONS OF A REAL VARIABLE

X THE GENERAL THEORY OF THE LOGARITHMIC, EXPONENTIAL AND CIRCULAR FUNCTIONS

Appendices

INDEX

==Review==
The book was intended to help reform mathematics teaching in the UK, and more specifically in the [[University of Cambridge]] and in schools preparing to study higher mathematics.  It was aimed directly at "scholarship level" students – the top 10% to 20% by ability.  Hardy himself did not originally find a passion for mathematics, only seeing it as a way to beat other students, which he did decisively, and gain scholarships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Hardy.html |title=Hardy biography |website=History.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk |date=1947-12-01 |accessdate=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his book excels in effectively explaining analytical number theory and calculus following the rigor of mathematics.

Whilst his book changed the way the subject was taught at university, the content reflects the era in which the book was written. The whole book explores number theory and the author constructs real numbers theoretically. It adequately deals with single-variable calculus, sequences, number series, properties of cos, sin, log, etc. but does not refer to mathematical groups, multi-variable functions or vector calculus. Each section includes some demanding problems. Hardy combines the enthusiasm of the missionary with the rigor of the purist in his exposition of the fundamental ideas of the differential and integral calculus, of the properties of infinite series and of other topics involving the notion of limit. Hardy's presentation of mathematical analysis is as valid today as when first written: students will find that his economical and energetic style of presentation is one that modern authors rarely come close to. Despite its limitations, it is considered a classic in its field. It is probably of most use to 1st year university students of pure mathematics.

In [[mathematics]], '''abuse of notation''' occurs when an author uses a [[mathematical notation]] in a way that is not formally correct but that seems likely to simplify the exposition or suggest the correct [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] (while being unlikely to introduce errors or cause confusion). However, the concept of formal correctness depends on time and on the context. Therefore, many notations in mathematics are qualified as abuse of notation in some context and are formally correct in other contexts; as many notations were introduced a long time before any formalization of the theory in which they are used, the qualification of abuse of notation is strongly time dependent. Moreover, many abuses of notation may be made formally correct by improving the theory.  ''Abuse of notation'' should be contrasted with ''misuse'' of notation, which should be avoided.

{{anchor|Abuse of language}} A related concept is '''abuse of language''' or '''abuse of terminology,''' when not notation but a ''term'' is misused. Abuse of language is an almost synonymous expression that is usually used for non-notational abuses. For example, while the word [[group representation|''representation'']] properly designates a [[group homomorphism]] from a [[Group theory|group]] ''G'' to [[General linear group|GL(''V'')]], where ''V'' is a [[vector space]], it is common to call ''V'' "a representation of ''G''". A common abuse of language consists in identifying two mathematical objects that are different but [[canonical isomorphism|canonically isomorphic]]. Examples include identifying a [[constant function]] and its value or identifying to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^3&lt;/math&gt; the [[Euclidean space]] of dimension three equipped with a [[Cartesian coordinate system]].

==Examples==
===Structured mathematical objects===
Many [[mathematical object]]s consist of a [[set (mathematics)|set]], often called the underlying set, equipped with some additional structure, typically a [[mathematical operation]] or a [[topological space|topology]]. It is a common abuse of notation to use the same notation for the underlying set and the structured object. For example, &lt;math&gt;\Bbb Z&lt;/math&gt; may denote the set of the [[integer]]s, the [[group (mathematics)|group]] of integers together with [[addition]], or the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] of integers with addition and [[multiplication]]. In general, there is no problem with this, and avoiding such an abuse of notation would make mathematical texts pedantic and difficult to read. When this abuse of notation may be confusing, one may distinguish between these structures by  denoting &lt;math&gt;(\Bbb Z, +)&lt;/math&gt; the group of integers with addition, and &lt;math&gt;(\Bbb Z, +, \cdot)&lt;/math&gt; the ring of integers.

Similarly, a [[topological space]] consists of a set {{math|''X''}} (the underlying set) and a topology &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T},&lt;/math&gt; which is characterized by a set of [[subset]]s of {{math|''X''}} (the [[open set]]s). Most frequently, one considers only one topology on {{math|''X''}}, and there is no problem to denote by {{math|''X''}} both the underlying set, and the pair consisting of {{math|''X''}} and its topology &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T},&lt;/math&gt; although they are different mathematical objects. Nevertheless, it occurs sometimes that two different topologies are considered simultaneously on the same set; for distinguishing the corresponding topological spaces, one must use notation such as &lt;math&gt;(X, \mathcal{T})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(X, \mathcal{T}').&lt;/math&gt;

===Functional notation===

One encounters, in many textbooks, sentences such as "Let {{math|''f''(''x'')}} be a function ...". This is an abuse of notation, as the name of the function is {{mvar|f}}, and {{math|''f''(''x'')}} denotes normally the value of the function {{mvar|f}} for the element {{mvar|x}} of its domain. The correct phrase would be "Let {{mvar|f}} be a function of the variable {{mvar|x}} ..." or "Let {{math|''x'' ↦ ''f''(''x'')}} be a function ..."  This abuse of notation is widely used, as it simplifies the formulation, and the systematic use of a correct notation quickly becomes pedantic.

A similar abuse of notation occurs in sentences such as "Let us consider the function {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x'' + 1}}..." In fact {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x'' + 1}} is not a function. The function is the operation that associates {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x'' + 1}} to {{mvar|''x''}}, often denoted as {{math|''x'' ↦ ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x'' + 1}}. Nevertheless, this abuse of notation is widely used since it is generally not confusing.

===Equality vs. isomorphism===

Many mathematical structures are defined through a characterizing property (often a [[universal property]]). Once this desired property is defined, there may be various ways to construct the structure, and the corresponding results are formally different objects, but which have exactly the same properties – they are [[isomorphic]]. As there is no way to distinguish these isomorphic objects through their properties, it is standard to consider them as equal, even if this is formally wrong.

One example of this the [[Cartesian product]], which is often seen as associative:
:&lt;math&gt;(E \times F) \times G = E \times (F \times G) = E \times F \times G&lt;/math&gt;.

But this is not strictly true: if &lt;math&gt;x \in E&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y \in F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z \in G&lt;/math&gt;, the identity &lt;math&gt;((x, y), z) = (x, (y, z))&lt;/math&gt; would imply that &lt;math&gt;(x, y) = x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z = (y, z)&lt;/math&gt;, and so &lt;math&gt;((x, y), z) = (x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt; would mean nothing.

This notion can be made rigorous in [[category theory]], using the idea of a [[natural isomorphism]].

Another example occurs in such statements as "there are two non-Abelian groups of order 8", which more strictly stated means "there are two isomorphism classes of non-Abelian groups of order 8".

===Equivalence classes===
Referring to an [[equivalence class]] of an [[equivalence relation]] by ''x'' instead of [''x''] is an abuse of notation. Formally, if a set ''X'' is [[partition of a set|partition]]ed by an equivalence relation ~, then for each ''x'' ∈ ''X'', the equivalence class {''y'' ∈ ''X'' | ''y'' ~ ''x''} is denoted [''x'']. But in practice, if the remainder of the discussion is focused on equivalence classes rather than individual elements of the underlying set, it is common to drop the square brackets in the discussion.

For example, in [[modular arithmetic]], a [[finite group]] of [[order (group theory)|order]] ''n'' can be formed by partitioning the integers via the equivalence relation ''x'' ~ ''y'' if and only if ''x'' &amp;equiv; ''y'' (mod ''n''). The elements of that group would then be [0], [1], &amp;hellip;, [''n'' − 1], but in practice they are usually just denoted 0, 1, &amp;hellip;, ''n'' − 1.

Another example is the space of (classes of) measurable functions over a [[measure space]], or classes of [[Lebesgue integral|Lebesgue integrable]] functions, where the equivalence relation is equality "[[almost everywhere]]".

==Subjectivity==
The terms "abuse of language" and "abuse of notation" depend on context. Writing "''f'': ''A'' → ''B''" for a [[partial function]] from ''A'' to ''B'' is almost always an abuse of notation, but not in a [[category (mathematics)|category theoretic]] context, where ''f'' can be seen as a [[morphism]] in the category of sets and partial functions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4272">In [[machine learning]], '''Bayesian Program Synthesis (BPS)''', Bayesian Programs write (synthesize) new Bayesian programs.  This is in contrast to the field of [[Probabilistic programming language|probabilistic programs]] where humans write new probabilistic (Bayesian) programs.

[[Bayesian probability|Bayesian probabilities]] is a strategy to learn distributions over Bayesian programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603542/ai-software-juggles-probabilities-to-learn-from-less-data/|title=AI Software Juggles Probabilities to Learn from Less Data|last=Knight|first=Will|date=|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2017-03-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bayesian Program Synthesis can be compared to the work on Bayesian Program Learning by Lake, Salakhutdinov, and Tenenbaum's,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; where probabilistic program components were hand-written, pre-trained on data, and then hand assembled in order to recognize handwritten characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lake|first=Brenden M.|last2=Salakhutdinov|first2=Ruslan|last3=Tenenbaum|first3=Joshua B.|date=2015-12-11|title=Human-level concept learning through probabilistic program induction|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6266/1332|journal=Science|language=en|volume=350|issue=6266|pages=1332–1338|doi=10.1126/science.aab3050|issn=0036-8075|pmid=26659050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The framework ==
Bayesian Program Synthesis (BPS) has been described as a framework related to and utilizing probabilistic programming. In BPS, probabilistic programs are generated that are themselves priors over a space of probabilistic programs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Technology/2017/0216/Startup-pairs-man-with-machine-to-crack-the-black-box-of-neural-networks|title=Startup pairs man with machine to crack the 'black box' of neural networks|last=Wood|first=Charlie|date=2017-02-16|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=2017-03-04|issn=0882-7729}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This strategy allows more automatic synthesis of new programs via inference and is achieved by the composition of modular component programs. 

The modularity in BPS allows inference to work on and test smaller probabilistic programs before being integrated into a larger model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://robohub.org/talking-machines-probabilistic-programming-with-ben-vigoda/|title=Talking Machines: Probabilistic programming, with Ben Vigoda {{!}} Robohub|website=robohub.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bayesian methods and models are frequently used to incorporate prior knowledge. When good prior knowledge can be incorporated into a Bayesian model, effective inference can often be performed with much less data.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/02/ais-factions-get-feisty-really-theyre-team/|title=AI’s Factions Get Feisty. But Really, They’re All on the Same Team|last=Metz|first=Cade|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-03-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This framework can be also be contrasted with the family of automated [[program synthesis]] fields, including program synthesis, [[programming by example]], and [[programming by demonstration]]. The goal in such fields is to find the best program that satisfies some constraint. In program synthesis, for instance, verification of logical constraints reduce the state space of possible programs, allowing more efficient search to find an optimal program. Bayesian Program Synthesis differs both in that the constraints are probabilistic and the output is itself a distribution over programs that can be further refined.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{dablink|For the canonical map of an algebraic variety into projective space, see [[Canonical bundle#Canonical maps]].}}

In mathematics, a '''canonical map''', also called a '''natural map''', is a map or morphism between objects that arises naturally from the definition or the construction of the objects being mapped against each other. In general it is the map which preserves the widest amount of structure, and it tends to be unique. In the rare cases where latitude in choice remains, the map is either conventionally agreed upon to be the most useful for further analysis, or sometimes simply the most elegant or beautiful known.

A closely related notion is a '''structure map''' or '''structure morphism'''; the map that comes with the given structure on the object. They are also sometimes called canonical maps.

A [[canonical isomorphism]] is a canonical map that is also an isomorphism (i.e., invertible).

In some contexts, it is necessary to address an issue of ''choices'' of canonical maps or canonical isomorphisms; see [[prestack#Definition|prestack]] for a typical example.

==Examples==
*If ''N'' is a [[normal subgroup]] of a group ''G'', then there is a canonical map from ''G'' to the [[quotient group]] ''G/N'' that sends an element ''g'' to the coset that ''g'' belongs to.
*If ''V'' is a [[vector space]], then there is a canonical map from ''V'' to the second [[dual space]] of ''V'' that sends a vector ''v'' to the linear functional ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt; defined by ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt;(λ) = λ(''v'').
*If ''f'' is a [[ring homomorphism]] from a commutative ring ''R'' to commutative ring ''S'', then ''S'' can be viewed as an [[algebra over a ring|algebra]] over ''R''. The ring homomorphism ''f'' is then called the structure map (for the algebra structure). The corresponding map on the [[prime spectrum|prime spectra]]: Spec(''S'') →Spec(''R'') is also called the structure map.
*If ''E'' is a [[vector bundle]] over a topological space ''X'', then the projection map from ''E'' to ''X'' is the structure map.
*In [[topology]], a canonical map is a function ''f'' mapping a set ''X'' → ''X'' (''X'' [[Modulo operation|modulo]] ''R''), where ''R'' is an [[equivalence relation]] in ''X'', that takes each ''x'' in ''X'' to the equivalence class ''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[x]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' modulo ''R''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eq4UDgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA274&amp;pg=PA274|title=Handbook of Mathematics|last=Vialar|first=Thierry|date=2016-12-07|publisher=BoD - Books on Demand|isbn=9782955199008|language=en|pages=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3495">In [[mathematics]], the method of '''clearing denominators''', also called '''clearing fractions''', is a technique for simplifying an [[equation]] equating two expressions that each are a sum of [[Rational function|rational expression]]s – which includes simple [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]s.

== Example ==

Consider the equation

: &lt;math&gt; \frac x 6 + \frac y {15z} = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[least common multiple|smallest common multiple]] of the two denominators 6 and 15''z'' is 30''z'', so one multiplies both sides by 30''z'':

: &lt;math&gt; 5xz + 2y = 30z. \, &lt;/math&gt;

The result is an equation with no fractions.

The simplified equation is not entirely equivalent to the original. For when we substitute {{nowrap|1=''y'' = 0}} and {{nowrap|1=''z'' = 0}} in the last equation, both sides simplify to 0, so we get {{nowrap|1=0 = 0}}, a mathematical truth. But the same substitution applied to the original equation results in {{nowrap|1=''x''/6 + 0/0 = 1}}, which is [[division by zero|mathematically meaningless]].

== Description ==
[[Without loss of generality]], we may assume that the [[right-hand side]] of the equation is 0, since an equation {{nowrap|1={{mvar|E}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = {{mvar|E}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} may equivalently be rewritten in the form {{nowrap|1={{mvar|E}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − {{mvar|E}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}}.

So let the equation have the form
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{P_i}{Q_i} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The first step is to determine a common denominator {{mvar|D}} of these fractions – preferably the [[least common denominator]], which is the least common multiple of the {{mvar|Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

This means that each {{mvar|Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a factor of {{mvar|D}}, so {{nowrap|1={{mvar|D}} = {{mvar|R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}}} for some expression {{mvar|R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} that is not a fraction. Then

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{P_i}{Q_i} = \frac{R_i P_i}{R_i Q_i} = \frac{R_i P_i} D \,,&lt;/math&gt;

provided that {{mvar|R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} does not assume the value 0 – in which case also {{mvar|D}} equals 0.

So we have now

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{P_i}{Q_i} = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{R_i P_i} D = \frac 1 D \sum_{i=1}^n R_i P_i = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Provided that {{mvar|D}} does not assume the value 0, the latter equation is equivalent with

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n R_i P_i = 0\,,&lt;/math&gt;

in which the denominators have vanished.

As shown by the provisos, care has to be taken not to introduce [[Zero of a function|zero]]s of {{mvar|D}} – viewed as a function of the [[unknown (mathematics)|unknown]]s of the equation – as [[spurious solution]]s.

==Example 2==

Consider the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{x(x+1)}+\frac{1}{x(x+2)}-\frac{1}{(x+1)(x+2)} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The least common denominator is {{nowrap|{{mvar|x}}({{mvar|x}} + 1)({{mvar|x}} + 2)}}.

Following the method as described above results in

:&lt;math&gt;(x+2)+(x+1)-x = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Simplifying this further gives us the solution {{nowrap|1={{mvar|x}} = −3}}.

It is easily checked that none of the zeros of {{nowrap|{{mvar|x}}({{mvar|x}} + 1)({{mvar|x}} + 2)}} – namely {{nowrap|1= {{mvar|x}} = 0}}, {{nowrap|1= {{mvar|x}} = −1}}, and {{nowrap|1= {{mvar|x}} = −2}} – is a solution of the final equation, so no spurious solutions were introduced.

In mathematics, and especially in [[category theory]], a '''commutative diagram''' is a [[Diagram (category theory)|diagram]] such that all directed paths in the diagram with the same start and endpoints lead to the same result. Commutative diagrams play the role in category theory that [[equations]] play in [[algebra]] (see Barr–Wells, Section 1.7).


==Description==
Parts of the diagram:
* objects (also known as ''vertices'') 
* [[morphism]]s (also known as ''arrows'' or ''edges'')
* path or [[category (mathematics)#Definition|composition]]
===Arrow symbols===
In algebra texts, the type of [[morphism]] can be denoted with different arrow usages: 
* [[monomorphism]]s with a &lt;math&gt;\hookrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
* [[epimorphism]]s with a &lt;math&gt;\twoheadrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
* [[isomorphism]]s with a &lt;math&gt;\overset{\sim}{\rightarrow}&lt;/math&gt;. 
* the dashed arrow typically represents the claim that the indicated morphism exists whenever the rest of the diagram holds; the arrow may optionally be labeled &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;. 
** If the dashed arrow is labeled &lt;math&gt;!&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\exists!&lt;/math&gt;, the morphism is furthermore unique. 

These [[Convention (norm)|conventions]] are common enough that texts often do not explain the meanings of the different types of arrow.

===Verifying commutativity===
Commutativity makes sense for a [[polygon]] of any finite number of sides (including just 1 or 2), and a diagram is commutative if every polygonal subdiagram is commutative.

Note that a diagram may be non-commutative, i.e., the composition of different paths in the diagram may not give the same result.

==Phrases==
Phrases like "this commutative diagram" or "the diagram commutes" may be used.

==Examples==
In the bottom-left diagram, which expresses the [[Isomorphism_theorems#First_isomorphism_theorem|first isomorphism theorem]], commutativity means that &lt;math&gt;f = \tilde{f} \circ \pi&lt;/math&gt; while in the bottom-right diagram, commutativity of the square means &lt;math&gt;h \circ f = k \circ g&lt;/math&gt;:
{| style="width: 65%; margin: 1em auto 1em auto;"
|-
| [[Image:First isomorphism theorem (plain).svg|175px]]
| [[Image:Commutative square.svg|150px]]
|}

For the diagram below to commute, we must have the three equalities: (1) &lt;math&gt; \; r \circ h \circ g = H \circ G \circ l, &lt;/math&gt; (2) &lt;math&gt; \; m \circ g = G \circ l, &lt;/math&gt; and (3) &lt;math&gt;\; r \circ h = H \circ m&lt;/math&gt;. 
Since the first equality follows from the last two, for the diagram to commute it suffices to show (2) and (3). However, since equality (3) does not generally follow from the other two equalities, for this diagram to commute it is generally not enough to only have equalities (1) and (2).

==Diagram chasing==
'''Diagram chasing''' (also called '''diagrammatic search''') is a method of [[mathematical proof]] used especially in [[homological algebra]].  Given a commutative diagram, a proof by diagram chasing involves the formal use of the properties of the diagram, such as [[injective]] or [[surjective]] maps, or [[exact sequence]]s. A [[syllogism]] is constructed, for which the graphical display of the diagram is just a visual aid. It follows that one ends up "chasing" elements around the diagram, until the desired element or result is constructed or verified.

Examples of proofs by diagram chasing include those typically given for the [[five lemma]], the [[snake lemma]], the [[zig-zag lemma]], and the [[nine lemma]].

== In higher category theory ==
{{Main|Higher category theory}}

In higher category theory, one considers not only objects and arrows, but arrows between the arrows, arrows between arrows between arrows, and so on [[wiktionary:ad_infinitum|ad infinitum]]. For example, the category of small categories '''Cat''' is naturally a 2-category, with [[Functor|functors]] as its arrows and [[Natural transformation|natural transformations]] as the arrows between functors. In this setting, commutative diagrams may include these higher arrows as well, which are often depicted in the following style: &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;. For example, the following (somewhat trivial) diagram depicts two categories '''{{var|C}}''' and '''{{var|D}}''', together with two functors {{var|F}}, {{var|G}} : '''{{var|C}}''' → '''{{var|D}}''' and a natural transformation {{var|α}} : {{var|F}} ⇒ {{var|G}}:

:[[Image:2-commutative-diagram.svg|200px]]

There are two kinds of composition in a 2-category (called '''vertical composition''' and '''horizontal composition'''), and they may also be depicted via [[pasting diagrams]], see [[2-category#Definition]] for examples.

== Diagrams as functors ==
{{Main|Diagram (category theory)}}

A commutative diagram in a category ''C'' can be interpreted as a [[functor]] from an index category ''J'' to ''C;'' one calls the functor a '''[[diagram (category theory)|diagram]].'''

More formally, a commutative diagram is a visualization of a diagram indexed by a [[poset category]]:
* one draws a node for every object in the index category,
* an arrow for a generating set of morphisms,
*:omitting identity maps and morphisms that can be expressed as compositions,
* and the commutativity of the diagram (the equality of different compositions of maps between two objects) corresponds to the uniqueness of a map between two objects in a poset category.

Conversely, given a commutative diagram, it defines a poset category:
* the objects are the nodes,
* there is a morphism between any two objects if and only if there is a (directed) path between the nodes,
* with the relation that this morphism is unique (any composition of maps is defined by its domain and target: this is the commutativity axiom).

However, not every diagram commutes (the notion of diagram strictly generalizes commutative diagram): most simply, the diagram of a single object with an endomorphism  (&lt;math&gt;f\colon X \to X&lt;/math&gt;), or with two parallel arrows (&lt;math&gt;\bullet \rightrightarrows \bullet&lt;/math&gt;, that is, &lt;math&gt;f,g\colon X \to Y&lt;/math&gt;, sometimes called the [[free quiver]]), as used in the definition of [[equaliser (mathematics)|equalizer]] need not commute. Further, diagrams may be messy or impossible to draw when the number of objects or morphisms is large (or even infinite).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5365">'''Ethnocomputing''' is the study of the interactions between computing and culture. It is carried out through theoretical analysis, empirical investigation, and design implementation. It includes research on the impact of computing on society, as well as the reverse: how [[culture|cultural]], [[history|historical]], personal, and [[society|societal]] origins and surroundings cause and affect the [[innovation]], development, [[diffusion (anthropology)|diffusion]], maintenance, and appropriation of [[computing|computational]] artifacts or ideas. From the ethnocomputing perspective, no computational technology is culturally "neutral," and no cultural practice is a computational void. Instead of considering culture to be a hindrance for software engineering, culture should be seen as a resource for innovation and design.

==Subject matter==
'''Social categories for ethnocomputing include''':
* Indigenous computing: In some cases, ethnocomputing "translates" from indigenous culture to high tech frameworks: for example, analyzing the African board game [[Oware|Owari]] as a one-dimensional cellular automaton.
* Social/historical studies of computing: In other cases ethnocomputing seeks to identify the social, cultural, historical, or personal dimensions of high tech computational ideas and artifacts: for example, the relationship between the Turing Test and Alan Turing's closeted gay identity.
* Appropriation in computing: lay persons who did not participate in the original design of a computing system can still affect it by modifying its interpretation, use, or structure. Such "modding" may be as subtle as the key board character "emoticons" created through lay use of email, or as blatant as the stylized customization of computer cases.
* Equity tools: a software "Applications Quest" has been developed for generating a "diversity index" that allows consideration of multiple identity characteristics in college admissions.

'''Technical categories in ethnocomputing include''':
* Organized structures and models used to represent information (data structures)
* Ways of manipulating the organized information (algorithms)
* Linguistic realizations of computation (theories of computation)
* Mechanical realizations of computation (computational tools)
* User interfaces
* Internationalization and localization
* Cultural HCI
* Uses of computational tools (uses)
* Ethnotechnology

==Origins==

Ethnocomputing has its origins in [[ethnomathematics]].  There are a large number of studies in ethnomathematics that could be considered ethnocomputing as well (e.g., [[Ron Eglash|Eglash]] (1999) and Ascher &amp; Ascher (1981)).  The idea of a separate field was introduced in 1992 by Anthony Petrillo in ''Responsive Evaluation of Mathematics Education in a Community of Jos, Nigeria,''  Dissertation (Ph.D.): State University of New York at Buffalo, which Petrillo elaborated a bit more on in March 1994, ''Ethnocomputers in Nigerian Computer Education,'' paper presented at the 31st Annual Conference of the Mathematical Association of Nigeria. Just like [[computer science]] is nowadays considered to be a field of research distinct from [[mathematics]], ethnocomputing is considered to be a research topic distinct from ethnomathematics.  Some aspects of ethnocomputing that have their roots in ethnomathematics are listed below:

* ''Counting and sorting'': The use of a systematic way to compare and order discrete objects
* ''Locating'': Exploring one's spatial environment and conceptualizing and symbolizing that environment with models, maps, drawings, and other devices
* ''Measuring'': Quantifying qualities like length and weight for the purposes of, for instance, comparing, classifying, or ordering objects
* ''Designing'': Applying formal or non-formal algorithmic or computational ideas in arts or design
* ''Playing'': Devising and engaging in games and pastimes with more or less formalized rules that all players must abide by
* ''Explaining'': Finding systematic ways to represent phenomena or the relationships between phenomena

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3821">A '''power quantity''' is a power or a quantity directly proportional to [[Power (physics)|power]], e.g., [[energy density]], [[acoustic intensity]], and [[luminous intensity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ainslie |first=Michael A. |url=http://acousticstoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/A-Century-of-Sonar.pdf |title=A Century of Sonar: Planetary Oceanography, Underwater Noise Monitoring, and the Terminology of Underwater Sound |journal=Acoustics Today |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=12–19 |date=Winter 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Energy quantities may also be labelled as power quantities in this context.&lt;ref&gt;ISO 80000:1-2009 §&amp;nbsp;C.3&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''root-power quantity''' is a quantity such as [[voltage]], [[Electric current|current]], [[sound pressure]], [[electric field strength]], [[speed]], or [[charge density]], the square of which, in linear systems, is proportional to power.&lt;ref name=Hearing&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian C.J. Moore |title=Hearing |date=1995 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-08-053386-5 |page=11 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=OywDx9pxCMYC |page=11 }} }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''root-power quantity'' was introduced in the {{section link|ISO 80000-1|Annex C}}; it replaces and deprecates the term '''field quantity'''.

It is essential to know which category a measurement belongs to when using [[decibel]]s (dB) for comparing the [[Level (logarithmic quantity)|level]]s of such quantities.  A change of one bel in the level corresponds to a 10× change in ''power'', so when comparing power quantities ''x'' and ''y'', the difference is defined to be 10×log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(''y''/''x'') decibel.  With root-power quantities, however the difference is defined as 20×log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(''y''/''x'') dB.&lt;ref name=Hearing/&gt;  In linear systems, these definitions allow the distinction between root-power quantities and power quantities to be ignored when specifying changes as levels: an amplifier can be described as having "3&amp;nbsp;dB" of gain without needing to specify whether voltage or power are being compared; for a given linear load (e.g. an {{val|8|ul=Ω}} speaker), such an increase will result in a 3&amp;nbsp;dB increase in both the [[sound pressure level]] and the [[sound power level]] at a given location near the speaker.  Conversely, when ratios cannot be identified as either power or root-power quantities, the units [[neper]] (Np) and [[decibel]] (dB) cannot be sensibly used.

In the analysis of signals and systems using sinusoids, field quantities and root-power quantities may be [[complex number|complex]]-valued.&lt;ref&gt;ISO 80000-1:2009 §&amp;nbsp;C.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ISO 80000-3:2006 §&amp;nbsp;0.5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IEC 60027-3:2002&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Root-power quantity" vs. "field quantity"==
In justifying the deprecation of the term "field quantity" and instead using "root-power quantity" in the context of levels, ISO&amp;nbsp;80000 draws attention to the conflicting use of the former term to mean a quantity that depends on the position,&lt;ref&gt;ISO 80000-1:2009 §&amp;nbsp;C.2&lt;/ref&gt; which in physics is called a ''[[Field (physics)|field]]''.  Such a field is often called a ''field quantity'' in the literature, but is called a ''field'' here for clarity.  Several types of field (such as the [[electromagnetic field]]) meet the definition of a root-power quantity, whereas others (such as the [[Poynting vector]] and [[temperature]]) do not.  Conversely, not every root-power quantity is a field (such as the voltage on a [[loudspeaker]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7319">'''Ganita-yukti-bhasa''' (also written as '''Ganita Yuktibhasa''') is either the title or a part of the title of three different books:

*'''Ganita-yukti-bhasa (Rationales in Mathematical Astronomy) of Jyesthadeva''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sarma |first=K.V. |last2=Ramasubramanian |first2=K. |last3=Srinivas, M.D. |last4=Sriram |first4=M.S. |title=Ganita-Yukti-Bhasa (Rationales in Mathematical Astronomy) of Jyesthadeva|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] (Jointly with Hindustan Book Agency (HBA), New Delhi, India)|date=2008|series=Sources and Studies in the History of Mathematics and Physical Sciences|volume=I (Mathematics), II (Astronomy)|pages=LXVIII, 1084|isbn=978-1-84882-072-2|language=English, Malayalam}}&lt;/ref&gt; published by [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]],&lt;ref&gt;See publishers's ([[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer's]]) [[web page]] on the book: {{cite web|url=https://www.springer.com/mathematics/history+of+mathematics/book/978-1-84882-072-2|title=Ganita-Yukti-Bhasa (Rationales in Mathematical Astronomy) of Jyesthadeva|accessdate=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is the first critical edition with an [[English language|English]] translation of [[Yuktibhasa]], a seminal treatise in the [[Malayalam]] language composed in c.1530 [[BCE|CE]]  by [[Jyeshthadeva]]. one of the most significant personalities of the [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics]]. The book is published in two volumes as Volume I and Volume II. Jyeshthadeva's Yuktibhasa discusses various topics in mathematics and astronomy and it is purported to be an enunciation of the rationales underlying the various mathematical assertions and the astronomical concepts and computations in the great treatise [[Tantrasamgraha]] of [[Nilakantha Somayaji]] (1444–1544). (An edition of the mathematical portion of [[Yuktibhasa]] with some explanatory notes in [[Malayalam]] had appeared in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;''Yuktibhâsâ, Part I'' (ed) with notes by Ramavarma (Maru) Thampuran and A. R. Akhileswara Aiyer, Magalodayam Ltd., [[Trichur]], [[Kerala]],  1123 [[Malayalam Era]], 1948 [[BCE|CE]].&lt;/ref&gt;)
*In addition to Jyshthadeva's Yuktibhasa, [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics]] had produced another work called '''Ganita Yuktibhasa'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=K.V. Sarma|author2=S. Hariharan|date=1991|title=Yuktibhasa of Jyesthadeva : A book of rationales in Indian mathematics and astronomy &amp;ndash; An analytical appraisal|journal=Indian Journal of History of Science|volume=26|issue=2|pages=185&amp;ndash;207|url=http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/rawdataupload/upload/insa/INSA_1/20005ac0_185.pdf|accessdate=2 May 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912165846/http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/rawdataupload/upload/insa/INSA_1/20005ac0_185.pdf|archivedate=12 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to [[Jyeshthadeva]]'s [[Yuktibhasa]], this work is in [[Sanskrit]]. The date of composition and the name of the author of this work in [[Sanskrit]] have not been determined with certainty. The book appears to be of a later period and seems to have been  composed as a somewhat rough Sanskrit translation of the Malayalam original [[Yuktibhasa]].
*'''Ganita Yuktibhasa (Volume III)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=K.V. Sarma|title=Ganita Yuktibhasa (Volume III)|publisher=[[Indian Institute of Advanced Study]]|location=[[Shimla]]|isbn=81-7986-052-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; is  the title of a book published by [[Indian Institute of Advanced Study]] (IIAS), [[Shimla]],  and it is a critical edition of the [[Sanskrit]] Ganita Yuktibhasa.&lt;ref&gt;Publisher's ([[Indian Institute of Advanced Study]]) [[web page]] on the book:{{cite web|url=http://www.iias.org/p_ganita_yuktibhasa_volume-III.html|title=Ganita Yuktibhasa by K.V. Sarma|accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is intended as the third volume of a series on [[Yuktibhasa]], the first two volumes being Volume I and Volume II of ''Ganita-yukti-bhasa (Rationales in Mathematical Astronomy) of [[Jyeshthadeva]]'' published by [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]].

==More on ''Ganita-yukti-bhasa (Rationales in Mathematical Astronomy) of Jyesthadeva''==

This edition of [[Yuktibhasa]] has been divided into two volumes, even though the original [[Malayalam]] text has no such division. Volume I deals with  mathematics and Volume II treats astronomy. Each volume is divided into three parts: First part is an [[English language|English]] translation of the relevant [[Malayalam]] part of [[Yuktibhasa]], second part contains  detailed explanatory notes on the translation,  and in the third part the text in the [[Malayalam]] original is reproduced. The [[English language|English]] translation is by [[K.V. Sarma]] and the explanatory notes are provided by Ramasubramanian, K., Srinivas, M.D. and Sriram, M.S..

Volume I dealing with mathematics is divided into seven chapters. The topics discussed are the eight mathematical operations, a certain set of ten problems, arithmetic of fractions, rule of three, [[Kuṭṭaka|Kuttakara]] (linear indeterminate equations), infinite series and approximations for the ratio of the circumference and diameter of a circle and infinite series and approximations for sines.&lt;ref name="Kinokuniya DataBase"&gt;For more details on contents see Kinokuniya DataBase: {{cite web|url=http://bookwebpro.kinokuniya.co.jp/booksea.cgi?ISBN=1848820720http://www.buscalibros.cl/libro.php?libro=2104208|title=Ganita-yukti-bhasa (Rationales in Mathematical Astronomy) of Jyesthadeva|accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volume II dealing with astronomy is divided into eight chapters. The topics covered are computation of mean and true longitudes of planets, Earth and celestial spheres, fifteen problems relating to ascension, declination, longitude, etc.,  determination of time, place, direction, etc., from gnomonic shadow, eclipses, Vyatipata (when the sun and moon have the same declination), visibility correction for planets  and phases of the moon.&lt;ref name="Kinokuniya DataBase"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33463">'''Graduate Texts in Mathematics''' ('''GTM''') (ISSN 0072-5285) is a series of [[graduate school|graduate-level]] [[textbooks]] in [[mathematics]] published by [[Springer-Verlag]].  The books in this series, like the other Springer-Verlag mathematics series, are yellow books of a standard size (with variable numbers of pages).  The GTM series is easily identified by a white band at the top of the book.

The books in this series tend to be written at a more advanced level than the similar [[Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics]] series, although there is a fair amount of overlap between the two series in terms of material covered and difficulty level.

'''Hatch marks''' (also called '''hash marks''' or '''tick marks''') are a form of mathematical notation. They are used in three ways: 
* Unit and value marks — as on a ruler or number line
* Congruency notation — as on a geometric figure
* Graphed points — as on a [[Chart|graph]]

Hatch marks are frequently used as an abbreviation of some common units of measurement. In  regard to distance, a single hatch mark indicates feet, and two hatch marks indicate inches. In regard to time, a single hatch mark indicates minutes, and two hatch marks indicate seconds.
In [[geometry]] and [[trigonometry]], such marks are used following an [[Degree symbol|elevated circle]] to indicate degrees, minutes, and seconds — '''(&amp;nbsp;°&amp;nbsp;)&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;′&amp;nbsp;)&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;&amp;Prime;&amp;nbsp;).'''

Hatch marks can probably be traced to [[hatching]] in art works, where the pattern of the hatch marks represents a unique tone or hue. Different patterns indicate different tones.

==Unit and value marks==
Unit-and-value hatch marks are short vertical line segments which mark distances. They are seen on [[ruler]]s and [[number line]]s. The marks are parallel to each other and are evenly spaced.

The distance between adjacent marks is one unit. Longer line segments are used for [[integer]]s and [[natural number]]s. Shorter line segments are used for [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]s.

Hatch marks provide a visual clue as to the value of specific points on the number line, even if some hatch marks are not labeled with a number.

Hatch marks are typically seen in [[number theory]] and [[geometry]].
 &lt;----|----'''|'''----|----'''|'''----|----'''|'''----|----'''|'''----|----'''|'''----|----'''|'''----|----'''|'''----&gt;
 
          -3        -2        -1         0         1         2         3

==Congruency notation==
[[Image:Hatch marks.svg|thumb|300px|Matching hatch marks are used here to indicate equal lengths. The two triangles are [[congruence relation|congruent]] and are [[ mirror image]]s of each other.]]
In [[geometry]], hatch marks are used to denote equal measures of angles, arcs, line segments, or other elements. 

Hatch marks for congruency notation are in the style of [[tally mark]]s or of [[Roman numerals]] – with some qualifications. These marks are without [[serif]]s, and some patterns are not used. For example, the numbers I, II, III, V, and X are used, but IV and VI are not used since a rotation of 180 degrees can make a 4 easily confused with a 6.

For example, if two triangles are drawn, the first pair of [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] sides can be marked with a single hatch mark on each. The second pair of congruent sides can be marked with two hatch marks each. The patterns are not alike: one pair uses one mark while the other pair uses two marks (Figure 1). This use of pattern makes it clear which sides are the same length even if the sides cannot be measured. If the sides do not appear to be congruent, as long as hatch marks are present and are the same number of hatch marks then the sides are congruent.

Note that the inverse situation should not be assumed.  That is, while sides that are hatch marked identically must be assumed to be congruent, it does not follow that sides hatch marked ''differently'' must be ''incongruent''.  The different hatch marks simply signal that the lengths may be taken to be independent of each other.  So, for example, while the triangles (Figure 1) cannot be shown to be [[Isosceles_triangle|isosceles triangles]] or [[Equilateral_triangle|equilateral triangles]], nevertheless the possibility that they ''could'' be either of those things is not precluded based on what is shown.

==Graphed points==
[[Line chart]]s may sometimes use hatch marks as graphed points. In the early days of computers, monitors and printers could only make charts using the characters available on a common typewriter. To graph a line chart of sales over time, symbols such as *, x, or | were used to mark points and various characters were used to mark the lines connecting them. While computers have advanced considerably, it is still not unusual to see x or | used as the points of interest or points of change on a graph.

'''The history of arithmetic''' includes the period from the emergence of counting before the formal definition of numbers and arithmetic operations over them by means of a system of [[axiom]]s. Arithmetic — the science of numbers, their properties and their relations — is one of the main [[mathematical sciences]]. It is closely connected with [[algebra]] and the [[theory of numbers]].

The practical need for counting, elementary [[measurement]]s and calculations became the reason for the emergence of arithmetic. The first authentic data on arithmetic knowledge are found in the historical monuments of [[Babylon]] and [[Ancient Egypt]] in the third and second millennia BC. The big contribution to the development of arithmetic was made by the [[Greek mathematics|ancient Greek mathematicians]], in particular [[Pythagoreans]], who tried to define all regularities of the world in terms of numbers. In the [[Middle Ages]] trade and approximate calculations were the main scope of arithmetic. Arithmetic developed first of all in [[history of India|India]] and the countries of [[history of Islam|Islam]] and only then came to [[Western Europe]]. In the seventeenth century the needs of [[astronomy]], [[mechanics]], and more difficult commercial calculations put before arithmetic new challenges regarding methods of calculation and gave an impetus to further development.

Theoretical justifications of the idea of number are connected first of all with the definition of "[[natural number]]" and [[Peano's axioms]] formulated in 1889. They were followed by strict definitions of [[rational number|rational]], [[real number|real]], [[negative number|negative]] and [[complex number]]s. Further expansion of the concept of number is possible only if one of the arithmetic laws is rejected.

== The  appearance of arithmetic ==
[[File:Os_d'Ishango_IRSNB.JPG|right|thumb|324x324px|The [[Ishango bone]], found near Lake Edward, possibly displaying a numbering system from more than 20,000 years ago.{{Sfn|Boyer &amp; Merzbach|2010|loc = Concepts and Relationships|name = Boyer_CR}}]]

If in two sets of subjects each element of one set has only one corresponding element in the other set, these sets are one-to-one. Such actual comparison when subjects were displayed in two ranks, was used by primitive tribes in trade. This approach gives the opportunity to establish quantitative ratios between groups of objects and doesn't demand the concept of [[number]].

Further there were natural [[Canon (basic principle)|standards]] for counting, for example, fingers of hands, and then sets of standards, such as hands. The advent of the standards symbolizing concrete numbers also is connected to the emergence of the concept of number. Thus the number of things to be counted was compared to the Moon in the sky, the number of eyes, and the number of fingers on a hand. Later numerous standards were replaced with one of the most convenient, usually fingers of hands and/or feet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11531">The study of [[manifold]]s combines many important areas of [[mathematics]]: it generalizes concepts such as [[curve]]s and [[surface (topology)|surface]]s as well as ideas from [[linear algebra]] and [[topology]]. Certain special classes of manifolds also have additional algebraic structure; they may behave like [[group (mathematics)|group]]s, for instance. In that case, they are called [[Lie Group]]s. Alternatively, they may be described by [[polynomial equations]], in which case they are called [[algebraic varieties]], and if they additionally carry a group structure, they are called [[algebraic group]]s.


== Nomenclature ==
The term "manifold" comes from German ''Mannigfaltigkeit,'' by Riemann.

In English, "manifold" refers to spaces with a differentiable or topological structure, 
while "variety" refers to spaces with an algebraic structure, as in algebraic varieties.

In Romance languages, manifold is translated as "variety" – such spaces with a differentiable structure are literally translated as "analytic varieties", while spaces with an algebraic structure are called "algebraic varieties". Thus for example, the french word "[[:fr:variété topologique|variété topologique]]" means [[topological manifold]]. In the same vein, the Japanese word "{{nihongo|多様体}}" (tayōtai) also encompasses both manifold and variety. ("{{nihongo|多様}}" (tayō) means various.)


==Background==
Ancestral to the modern concept of a manifold were several important results of 18th and 19th century mathematics. The oldest of these was [[Non-Euclidean geometry]], which considers spaces where [[Euclid]]'s [[parallel postulate]] fails. [[Giovanni Gerolamo Saccheri|Saccheri]] first studied this geometry in 1733. [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky|Lobachevsky]], [[János Bolyai|Bolyai]], and [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]] developed the subject further 100 years later. Their research uncovered two types of spaces whose geometric structures differ from that of classical [[Euclidean space]]; these are called [[hyperbolic geometry]] and [[elliptic geometry]]. In the modern theory of manifolds, these notions correspond to manifolds with constant, negative and positive [[curvature]], respectively.

[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] may have been the first to consider abstract spaces as mathematical objects in their own right.  His [[theorema egregium]] gives a method for computing the [[curvature]] of a [[Surface (topology)|surface]] without considering the [[ambient space]] in which the surface lies.  In modern terms, the theorem proved that the curvature of the surface is an intrinsic property. Manifold theory has come to focus exclusively on these intrinsic properties (or invariants), while largely ignoring the extrinsic properties of the ambient space.

Another, more [[topology|topological]] example of an intrinsic [[topological property|property]] of a manifold is the [[Euler characteristic]]. For a non-intersecting [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] in  the [[Euclidean space|Euclidean plane]], with ''V'' vertices (or corners), ''E'' edges and ''F'' faces (counting the exterior) [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] showed that ''V''-''E''+''F''= 2.  Thus 2 is called the Euler characteristic of the plane.  By contrast, in 1813 Antoine-Jean Lhuilier showed that the Euler characteristic of the [[torus]] is 0, since the [[complete graph]] on seven points can be embedded into the torus. The Euler characteristic of other surfaces is a useful [[topological invariant]], which has been extended to higher [[Dimension (mathematics and physics)|dimensions]] using [[Betti number]]s. In the mid nineteenth century, the [[Gauss–Bonnet theorem]] linked the Euler characteristic to the [[Gaussian curvature]].

[[Lagrangian mechanics]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics]], when considered geometrically, are naturally manifold theories.  All these use the notion of several characteristic [[axis (mathematics)|axes]] or [[dimension]]s (known as [[generalized coordinates]] in the latter two cases), but these dimensions do not lie along the physical dimensions of width, height, and breadth.

In the early 19th century the theory of [[elliptic function]]s succeeded in giving a basis for the theory of [[elliptic integral]]s, and this left open an obvious avenue of research. The standard forms for elliptic integrals involved the [[square root]]s of [[cubic polynomial|cubic]] and [[quartic polynomial]]s. When those were replaced by polynomials of higher degree, say [[quintic polynomial|quintics]], what would happen? 

In the work of [[Niels Abel]] and [[Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi|Carl Jacobi]], the answer was formulated: the [[Abelian integral|resulting integral]] would involve functions of [[two complex variables]], having four independent ''periods'' (i.e. period vectors). This gave the first glimpse of an '''abelian variety''' of dimension 2 (an '''abelian surface'''): what would now be called the ''[[Jacobian variety|Jacobian]] of a [[hyperelliptic curve]] of genus 2''.

==Riemann==

[[Bernhard Riemann]] was the first to do extensive work generalizing the idea of a surface to higher dimensions. The name ''manifold'' comes from Riemann's original [[German language|German]] term, ''Mannigfaltigkeit'', which [[William Kingdon Clifford]] translated as "manifoldness". In his Göttingen inaugural lecture, Riemann described the set of all possible values of a variable with certain constraints as a ''Mannigfaltigkeit'', because the variable can have ''many'' values. He distinguishes between ''stetige Mannigfaltigkeit'' and ''diskrete'' ''Mannigfaltigkeit'' (''continuous manifoldness'' and ''discontinuous manifoldness''), depending on whether the value changes continuously or not. As continuous examples, Riemann refers to not only colors and the locations of objects in space, but also the possible shapes of a spatial figure. Using [[Mathematical induction|induction]], Riemann constructs an ''n-fach ausgedehnte Mannigfaltigkeit'' (''n times extended manifoldness'' or ''n-dimensional manifoldness'') as a continuous stack of (n−1) dimensional manifoldnesses. Riemann's intuitive notion of a ''Mannigfaltigkeit'' evolved into what is today formalized as a manifold. [[Riemannian manifold]]s and [[Riemann surface]]s are named after Bernhard Riemann.

In 1857, Riemann introduced the concept of [[Riemann surface]]s as part of a study of the process of [[analytic continuation]]; Riemann surfaces are now recognized as one-dimensional complex manifolds. He also furthered the study of abelian and other multi-variable complex functions.

==Contemporaries of Riemann==

[[Johann Benedict Listing]], inventor of the word "[[topology]]", wrote an 1847 paper "Vorstudien zur Topologie" in which he defined a "[[simplicial complex|complex]]". He first defined the [[Möbius strip]] in 1861 (rediscovered four years later by [[August Ferdinand Möbius|Möbius]]), as an example of a non-[[orientable surface]].

After Abel, Jacobi, and Riemann, some of the most important contributors to the theory of [[abelian function]]s were [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass]], [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius|Frobenius]], [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] and [[Charles Émile Picard|Picard]]. The subject was very popular at the time, already having a large literature. By the end of the 19th century, mathematicians had begun to use geometric methods in the study of abelian functions.

==Poincaré==

[[Henri Poincaré]]'s 1895 paper [[Analysis Situs (paper)|Analysis Situs]] studied three-and-higher-dimensional manifolds(which he called "varieties"), giving rigorous definitions of homology, homotopy, and [[Betti number]]s and raised a question, today known as the [[Poincaré conjecture]], based his new concept of the [[fundamental group]].  In 2003, [[Grigori  Perelman]] proved the conjecture using [[Richard S. Hamilton]]'s [[Ricci flow]], this is after nearly a century of effort by many mathematicians.

==Later developments==

[[Hermann Weyl]] gave an intrinsic definition for differentiable manifolds in 1912. During the 1930s [[Hassler Whitney]] and others clarified the [[foundations of mathematics|foundational]] aspects of the subject, and thus intuitions dating back to the latter half of the 19th century became precise, and developed through [[differential geometry]] and [[Lie group]] theory.

The [[Whitney embedding theorem]] showed that manifolds intrinsically defined by charts could always be embedded in Euclidean space, as in the extrinsic definition, showing that the two concepts of manifold were equivalent. Due to this unification, it is said to be the first complete exposition of the modern concept of manifold.

Eventually, in the 1920s, [[Solomon Lefschetz|Lefschetz]] laid the basis for the study of abelian functions in terms of complex tori. He also appears to have been the first to use the name "[[abelian variety]]"; in [[Romance languages]], "variety" was used to translate Riemann's term "Mannigfaltigkeit". It was [[André Weil|Weil]] in the 1940s who gave this subject its modern foundations in the language of algebraic geometry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4848">'''Hume's principle''' or '''HP'''—the terms were coined by [[George Boolos]]—says that the number of ''F''s is equal to the number of ''G''s if and only if there is a [[one-to-one correspondence]] (a [[bijection]]) between the ''F''s and the ''G''s. HP can be stated formally in systems of [[second-order logic]]. Hume's principle is named for the Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]].

HP plays a central role in [[Gottlob Frege]]'s philosophy of mathematics. Frege shows that HP and suitable definitions of arithmetical notions [[logical consequence|entail]] all axioms of what we now call [[second-order arithmetic]]. This result is known as [[Frege's theorem]], which is the foundation for a philosophy of mathematics known as [[Logicism#Neo-logicism|neo-logicism]].

== Origins ==
Hume's principle appears in Frege's ''Foundations of Arithmetic'' (§73), which quotes from Part III of Book I of [[David Hume]]'s ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' (1740). Hume there sets out seven fundamental relations between ideas. Concerning one of these, [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]] in [[quantity]] or [[number]], Hume argues that our reasoning about proportion in quantity, as represented by [[geometry]], can never achieve "perfect precision and exactness", since its principles are derived from sense-appearance. He contrasts this with reasoning about number or [[arithmetic]], in which such a precision ''can'' be attained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Algebra and arithmetic [are] the only sciences in which we can carry on a chain of reasoning to any degree of intricacy, and yet preserve a perfect exactness and certainty. We are possessed of a precise standard, by which we can judge of the equality and proportion of numbers; and according as they correspond or not to that standard, we determine their relations, without any possibility of error. ''When two numbers are so combined, as that the one has always a unit answering to every unit of the other, we pronounce them equal''; and it is for want of such a standard of equality in [spatial] extension, that geometry can scarce be esteemed a perfect and infallible science. (I. III. I.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Note Hume's use of the word ''[[number]]'' in the ancient sense, to mean a set or collection of things rather than the common modern notion of "positive integer". The ancient Greek notion of number (''arithmos'') is of a finite plurality composed of units. See [[Aristotle]], ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', 1020a14 and [[Euclid]], ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', Book VII, Definition 1 and 2. The contrast between the old and modern conception of number is discussed in detail in Mayberry (2000).

== Influence on set theory ==
The principle that [[cardinal number]] was to be characterized in terms of [[one-to-one correspondence]] had previously been used to great effect by [[Georg Cantor]], whose writings [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]] knew. The suggestion has therefore been made that Hume's principle ought better be called "Cantor's Principle". But Frege criticized Cantor on the ground that Cantor defines [[cardinal number]]s in terms of [[ordinal number]]s, whereas Frege wanted to give a characterization of cardinals that was independent of the ordinals. Cantor's point of view, however, is the one embedded in contemporary theories of [[transfinite number]]s, as developed in [[axiomatic set theory]].

In [[mathematics]], '''ideal theory''' is the theory of [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s in [[commutative ring]]s; and is the precursor name for the contemporary subject of [[commutative algebra]]. The name grew out of the central considerations, such as the [[Lasker–Noether theorem]] in [[algebraic geometry]], and the [[ideal class group]] in [[algebraic number theory]], of the commutative algebra of the first quarter of the twentieth century. It was used in the influential [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|van der Waerden]] text on [[abstract algebra]] from around 1930.

The ideal theory in question had been based on [[elimination theory]], but in line with [[David Hilbert]]'s taste moved away from [[algorithm]]ic methods. [[Gröbner basis]] theory has now reversed the trend, for [[computer algebra]].

The importance of the ideal in general of a [[module (mathematics)|module]], more general than an ''ideal'', probably led to the perception that ''ideal theory'' was too narrow a description. [[Valuation theory]], too, was an important technical extension, and was used by [[Helmut Hasse]] and [[Oscar Zariski]].  [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]] used ''commutative algebra''; sometimes ''local algebra'' is applied to the theory of [[local ring]]s. [[D. G. Northcott]]'s 1953 [[Cambridge Tract]] ''Ideal Theory'' (reissued 2004 under the same title) was one of the final appearances of the name.

 |}
In [[algebra]], the terms '''left''' and '''right''' denote the order of a [[binary operation]] (usually, but not always called "[[multiplication]]") in non-[[commutative property|commutative]] [[algebraic structure]]s.
A binary operation&amp;nbsp;∗ is usually written [[infix notation|in the infix form]]:
:{{bigmath|''s'' ∗ ''t''}}
The [[argument of a function|argument]]&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|s}} is placed on the left side, and the argument&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|t}} is on the right side. Even if the symbol of the operation is omitted, the order of {{mvar|s}} and {{mvar|t}} does matter unless ∗ is commutative.

A '''two-sided''' property is fulfilled on both sides. A '''one-sided''' property is related to one (unspecified) of two sides.

Although terms are similar, left–right distinction in algebraic parlance is not related either to [[one-sided limit|left and right limits]] in calculus, or to [[orientation (geometry)|left and right in geometry]].

== Binary operation as an operator ==
A binary operation&amp;nbsp;{{bigmath|∗}} may be considered as a [[parametric family|family]] of [[unary operation|unary]] [[operator (mathematics)|operators]] through [[currying]]
:{{bigmath|1=''R''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') = ''s'' ∗ ''t''}},
depending on&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|t}} as a parameter. It is the family of ''right'' operations. Similarly,
:{{bigmath|1=''L''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') = ''s'' ∗ ''t''}}
defines the family of ''left'' operations parametrized with&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|s}}.

If for some&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|e}}, the left operation&amp;nbsp;{{math|''L''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is [[identity function|identical]], then {{mvar|e}} is called a left [[identity element|identity]]. Similarly, if {{math|1=''R''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''id''}}, then {{mvar|e}} is a right identity.

In [[ring theory]], a subring which is [[invariant set|invariant]] under ''any'' left multiplication in a ring, is called a left [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]. Similarly, a right multiplications-invariant subring is a right ideal.

== Left and right modules ==
Over [[non-commutative ring]]s, the left–right distinction is applied to [[module (mathematics)|modules]], namely to specify the side where a scalar (module element) appear in the [[scalar multiplication]]. 
{| align=center class="wikitable"
 !Left module
 !Right module
 |- align=center
 |{{bigmath|1=''s''('''x''' + '''y''') = ''s'''''x''' + ''s'''''y'''}}&lt;br/&gt;{{bigmath|1=(''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)'''x''' = ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''x''' + ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''x'''}} &lt;br/&gt;{{bigmath|1=''s''(''t'''''x''') = (''s t'')'''x'''}}
 |{{bigmath|1=('''x''' + '''y''')''t'' = '''x'''''t'' + '''y'''''t''}}&lt;br/&gt; {{bigmath|1='''x'''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = '''x'''''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + '''x'''''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}&lt;br/&gt;{{bigmath|1=('''x'''''s'')''t'' = '''x'''(''s t'')}}
 |}
The distinction is not purely syntactical because implies two different associativity rules (the lowest row in the table) which link multiplication in a module with multiplication in a ring.

A [[bimodule]] is simultaneously a left and right module, with two ''different'' scalar multiplication operations, obeying an obvious associativity condition on them.

== Other examples ==
* [[left eigenvector]]s
* left and right [[group action]]s

== In category theory ==
In [[category theory]] the usage of "left" is "right" has some algebraic resemblance, but refers to left and right sides of [[morphism]]s. See [[adjoint functors]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1160">In the [[philosophy of mathematics]], specifically the philosophical foundations of [[set theory]], '''limitation of size''' is a concept developed by [[Philip Jourdain]] and/or [[Georg Cantor]] to avoid [[Cantor's paradox]]. It identifies certain "inconsistent multiplicities", in Cantor's terminology, that cannot be [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] because they are "too large". In modern terminology these are called [[class (set theory)|proper classes]].

==Use==
The [[axiom of limitation of size]] is an axiom in some versions of [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]] or [[Morse–Kelley set theory]]. This axiom says that any class which is not "too large" is a set, and a set cannot be "too large". "Too large" is defined as being large enough that the class of all sets can be mapped one-to-one into it.

The [[language of mathematics]] has a vast [[vocabulary]] of specialist and technical terms. It also has a certain amount of [[jargon]]: commonly used phrases which are part of the culture of mathematics, rather than of the subject. Jargon often appears in lectures, and sometimes in print, as informal shorthand for rigorous arguments or precise ideas. Much of this is common English, but with a specific non-obvious meaning when used in a mathematical sense.

Some phrases, like "in general",  appear below in more than one section.

==Philosophy of mathematics==
; [[abstract nonsense]]{{anchor|abstract nonsense}}: Also ''general abstract nonsense'' or ''generalized abstract nonsense'', a [[tongue-in-cheek]] reference to [[category theory]], using which one can employ arguments that establish a (possibly concrete) result without reference to any specifics of the present problem.
{{quote|[The paper of {{Harvard citations|last2 = Mac Lane|last1 = Eilenberg|year = 1942|txt = yes}}] introduced the very abstract idea of a 'category' &amp;mdash; a subject then called 'general abstract nonsense'!|{{Harvard citations|last = Mac Lane|first = Saunders|year = 1997|txt=yes}}}}
{{quote|[Grothendieck] raised algebraic geometry to a new level of abstraction...if certain mathematicians could console themselves for a time with the hope that all these complicated structures were 'abstract nonsense'...the later papers of Grothendieck and others showed that classical problems...which had resisted efforts of several generations of talented mathematicians, could be solved in terms of...complicated concepts.|{{Harvard citations|last = Monastyrsky|first = Michael|year = 2001|txt = yes}}}}
; [[canonical form|canonical]]{{anchor|canonical}}: A reference to a standard or choice-free presentation of some mathematical object. The term ''canonical'' is also used more informally, meaning roughly "standard" or "classic". For example, one might say that [[Euclid's Theorem#Euclid's proof|Euclid's proof]] is the "canonical proof" of the infinitude of primes.
{{quote|1=There are two canonical proofs that are always used to show non-mathematicians what a mathematical proof is like: {{unbulleted list|item_style=line-height:200%; padding-left:1em;|&amp;mdash;The proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers.|&amp;mdash;The proof of the irrationality of the square root of two.}}|2={{Harvard citations|last = Wiedijk|first = Freek|year = 2006|txt = yes|loc = p.2}}}}
; deep{{anchor|deep}}: A result is called "deep" if its proof requires concepts and methods that are advanced beyond the concepts needed to formulate the result. The [[prime number theorem]], proved with techniques from [[complex analysis]], was thought to be a deep result until [[elementary proof]]s were found.  The fact that [[π]] is irrational is a deep result because it requires considerable development of [[real analysis]] to prove, even though it can be stated in terms of simple number theory and geometry.
; [[mathematical beauty|elegant]]{{anchor|elegant}}: Also ''beautiful''; an aesthetic term referring to the ability of an idea to provide insight into mathematics, whether by unifying disparate fields, introducing a new perspective on a single field, or providing a technique of proof which is either particularly simple, or captures the intuition or imagination as to why the result it proves is true.  [[Gian-Carlo Rota]] distinguished between ''elegance of presentation'' and ''beauty of concept'', saying that for example, some topics could be written about elegantly although the mathematical content is not beautiful, and some theorems or proofs are beautiful but may be written about inelegantly.
{{quote|The beauty of a mathematical theory is independent of the aesthetic qualities...of the theory's rigorous expositions.  Some beautiful theories may never be given a presentation which matches their beauty....Instances can also be found of mediocre theories of questionable beauty which are given brilliant, exciting expositions....[Category theory] is rich in beautiful and insightful definitions and poor in elegant proofs....[The theorems] remain clumsy and dull....[Expositions of [[projective geometry]]] vied for one another in elegance of presentation and in cleverness of proof....In retrospect, one wonders what all the fuss was about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematicians may say that a theorem is beautiful when they really mean to say that it is enlightening.  We acknowledge a theorem's beauty when we see how the theorem  'fits' in its place....We say that a proof is beautiful when such a proof finally gives away the secret of the theorem....|{{Harvard citations|last = Rota|first = Gian-Carlo|year = 1977|loc1 = pp.173&amp;ndash;174|loc2 = pp.181&amp;ndash;182|txt = yes}}}}
; [[elementary proof|elementary]]{{anchor|elementary}}: A proof or result is called "elementary" if it requires only basic concepts and methods, in contrast to so-called [[#deep|deep]] results. The concept of "elementary proof" is used specifically in [[number theory]], where it usually refers to a proof that does not use methods from [[complex analysis]].
; [[mathematical folklore|folklore]] {{anchor|folklore}}: A result is called "folklore" if it is non-obvious, has not been published, and yet is generally known among the specialists in a field. Usually, it is unknown who first obtained the result. If the result is important, it may eventually find its way into the textbooks, whereupon it ceases to be folklore.
{{quote|Many of the results mentioned in this paper should be considered "folklore" in that they merely formally state ideas that are well-known to researchers in the area, but may not be obvious to beginners and to the best of my knowledge do not appear elsewhere in print.|{{Harvard citations |last=Impagliazzo |first=Russell |year=1995 |txt= yes}}}}
; [[natural transformation|natural]]{{anchor|natural}}: Similar to "canonical" but more specific, this term makes reference to a description (almost exclusively in the context of [[transformation (mathematics)|transformation]]s) which holds independently of any choices.  Though long used informally, this term has found a formal definition in category theory.
; [[pathological (mathematics)|pathological]]{{anchor|pathological}}: An object behaves pathologically (or, somewhat more broadly used, in a ''degenerated'' way) if it fails to conform to the generic behavior of such objects, fails to satisfy certain regularity properties (depending on context), or simply disobeys mathematical intuition.  These can be and often are contradictory requirements.  Sometimes the term is more pointed, referring to an object which is specifically and artificially exhibited as a counterexample to these properties.
{{quote|Since half a century we have seen arise a crowd of bizarre functions which seem to try to resemble as little as possible the honest functions which serve some purpose....Nay more, from the logical point of view, it is these strange functions which are the most general....to-day they are invented expressly to put at fault the reasonings of our fathers....|{{Harvard citations|last = Poincaré|first = Henri|year = 1913|txt = yes}}}}
{{quote|[The [[Dirichlet function]]] took on an enormous importance...as giving an incentive for the creation of new types of function whose properties departed completely from what intuitively seemed admissible.  A celebrated example of such a so-called 'pathological' function...is [[Weierstrass function|the one provided by Weierstrass]]....This function is continuous but not differentiable.|{{Harvard citations|last = Pinto|first = J. Sousa|year = 2004|txt = yes}}}}
:Note for that latter quote that as the differentiable functions are [[meagre set|meagre]] in the space of continuous functions, as Banach found out in 1931&lt;!-- source: the WP article on meagre sets !--&gt;, differentiable functions are colloquially speaking a rare exception among the continuous ones. Thus it can hardly be defended any-more to call non-differentiable continuous functions pathological.
; [[Rigour#Mathematical rigour|rigor (rigour)]]{{anchor|rigour}}: Mathematics strives to establish its results using indisputable logic rather than informal descriptive argument.  Rigor is the use of such logic in a proof.
; [[well-behaved]]{{anchor|well-behaved}}: An object is well-behaved (in contrast with being ''[[#pathological|pathological]]'') if it ''does'' satisfy the prevailing regularity properties, or sometimes if it conforms to intuition (but intuition often suggests the opposite behavior as well). Similar to ''smooth'' (see below).

==Descriptive informalities==
Although ultimately every mathematical argument must meet a high standard of precision, mathematicians use descriptive but informal statements to discuss recurring themes or concepts with unwieldy formal statements.  Note that many of the terms are completely rigorous in context.
; [[almost all]]{{anchor|almost all}}: A shorthand term for "all except for a set of [[measure zero]]", when there is a measure to speak of.  For example, "almost all [[real numbers]] are [[transcendental number|transcendental]]" because the [[algebraic numbers|algebraic real numbers]] form a [[countable]] subset of the real numbers with measure zero.  One can also speak of "almost all" [[integers]] having a property to mean "all except finitely many", despite the integers not admitting a measure for which this agrees with the previous usage.  For example, "almost all [[prime number]]s are odd". There is a more complicated meaning for integers as well, discussed in the main article.  Finally, this term is sometimes used synonymously with ''generic'', below.
; [[arbitrarily large]]{{anchor|arbitrarily large}}{{anchor|arbitrarily small}}{{anchor|arbitrarily close}}: Notions which arise mostly in the context of limits, referring to the recurrence of a phenomenon as the limit is approached. A statement such as that predicate ''P'' is satisfied by arbitrarily large values, can be expressed in more formal notation by {{nowrap|∀''x'' : ∃''y'' ≥ ''x'' : ''P''(''y'')}}.  See also ''frequently''. The statement that quantity ''f''(''x'') depending on ''x'' "can be made" arbitrarily large, corresponds to {{nowrap|∀''y'' : ∃''x'' : ''f''(''x'') ≥ ''y''}}.
; [[arbitrary]]{{anchor|arbitrary}}: A shorthand for the [[universal quantifier]].  An arbitrary choice is one which is made unrestrictedly, or alternatively, a statement holds of an arbitrary element of a set if it holds of any element of that set. Also much in general-language use among mathematicians: "Of course, this problem can be arbitrarily complicated".
; [[Eventually (mathematics)|eventually]]{{anchor|eventually}}: In the context of limits, this is shorthand meaning ''for sufficiently large arguments''; the relevant argument(s) are implicit in the context.  As an example, the function log(log(''x'')) ''eventually'' becomes larger than 100"; in this context, "eventually" means "for [[#sufficiently large|sufficiently large]] ''x''.
; [[Lift (mathematics)|factor through]]{{anchor|factor through}}&lt;!-- This anchor is linked from [[Exact category]] --&gt;: A term in [[category theory]] referring to composition of morphisms.  If we have three objects ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' and a map &lt;math&gt;f \colon A \to C&lt;/math&gt; which is written as a composition &lt;math&gt;f = h \circ g&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;g \colon A \to B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h \colon B \to C&lt;/math&gt;, then ''f'' is said to ''factor through'' any (and all) of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;.
; finite{{anchor|finite}}: Next to the usual meaning of "not infinite", in another more restrictive meaning that one may encounter, a value being said to be "finite" also excludes [[infinitesimal]] values and the value 0. For example, if the [[variance]] of a random variable is said to be finite, this implies it is a positive real number.
; frequently{{anchor|frequently}}: In the context of limits, this is shorthand for ''[[#arbitrarily large|arbitrarily large]] arguments'' and its relatives; as with ''eventually'', the intended variant is implicit.  As an example, the sequence &lt;math&gt;(-1)^n&lt;/math&gt; is frequently in the interval (1/2, 3/2), because there are arbitrarily large ''n'' for which the value of the sequence is in the interval. 

; [[Generic property|generic]]{{anchor|generic}}: This term has similar connotations as ''almost all'' but is used particularly for concepts outside the purview of [[measure theory]].  A property holds "generically" on a set if the set satisfies some (context-dependent) notion of density, or perhaps if its complement satisfies some (context-dependent) notion of smallness.  For example, a property which holds on a [[Dense set|dense]] '''G'''&lt;sub&gt;δ&lt;/sub&gt; (intersection of countably many open sets) is said to hold generically.  In [[algebraic geometry]], one says that a property of points on an [[algebraic variety]] that holds on a dense [[Zariski topology|Zariski open]] set is true generically; however, it is usually not said that a property which holds merely on a dense set (which is not Zariski open) is generic in this situation.
; in general{{anchor|in general}}: In a descriptive context, this phrase introduces a simple characterization of a broad class of objects, with an eye towards identifying a unifying principle.  This term introduces an "elegant" description which holds for "[[#arbitrary|arbitrary]]" objects.  Exceptions to this description may be mentioned explicitly, as "[[#pathological|pathological]]" cases.
{{quote|Norbert A’Campo of the University of Basel once asked Grothendieck about something related to the [[Platonic solid]]s.  Grothendieck advised caution. The Platonic solids are so beautiful and so exceptional, he said, that one cannot assume such exceptional beauty will hold in more general situations.|{{Harvard citations|last=Jackson|first = Allyn|year=2004|loc = p.1197|txt = yes}}}}
; [[Sides of an equation|left-hand side, right-hand side]] (LHS, RHS){{anchor|LHS|RHS}}: Most often, these refer simply to the left-hand or the right-hand side of an equation; for example, &lt;math&gt;x = y + 1&lt;/math&gt; has ''x'' on the LHS and ''y'' + 1 on the RHS.  Occasionally, these are used in the sense of [[Value (computer science)|lvalue]] and rvalue: an RHS is primitive, and an LHS is derivative.
; nice{{anchor|proper}}: A mathematical object is colloquially called ''nice'' or ''sufficiently nice'' if it satisfies hypotheses or properties, sometimes unspecified or even unknown, that are especially desirable in a given context. It is an informal antonym for [[Mathematical jargon#pathological|pathological]]. For example, one might conjecture that a differential operator ought to satisfy a certain boundedness condition "for nice test functions," or one might state that some interesting topological invariant should be computable "for nice spaces ''X''."
; onto{{anchor|onto}}: A function (which in mathematics is generally defined as mapping the elements of one set A to elements of another B) is called "A onto B" (instead of "A to B") only if it is [[surjective]]; it may even be said that "f is onto" (i. e. surjective). Not translatable (without circumlocutons) to languages other than English.
; proper{{anchor|proper}}: If, for some notion of substructure, objects are substructures of themselves (that is, the relationship is reflexive), then the qualification ''proper'' requires the objects to be different. For example, a ''proper'' subset of a set ''S'' is a [[subset]] of ''S'' that is different from ''S'', and a ''proper'' divisor of a number ''n'' is a divisor of ''n'' that is different from ''n''.  This [[Operator overloading|overloaded]] word is also non-jargon for a [[proper morphism]].
; regular {{anchor|regular}}: A function is called ''regular'' if it satisfies satisfactory continuity and differentiability properties, which are often context-dependent. These properties might include possessing a specified number of derivatives, with the function and its derivatives exhibiting some ''nice'' property (see ''nice'' above), such as [[Hölder continuity]]. Informally, this term is sometimes used synonymously with ''smooth'', below. These imprecise uses of the word ''regular'' are not to be confused with the notion of a [[Regular space|regular topological space]], which is rigorously defined.
; resp.{{anchor|resp.}}: (Respectively) A convention to shorten parallel expositions. "A (resp. B) [has some relationship to] X (resp. Y)" means that A [has some relationship to] X and also that B [has (the same) relationship to] Y. For example, squares (resp. triangles) have 4 sides (resp. 3 sides); or compact (resp. Lindelöf) spaces are ones where every open cover has a finite (resp. countable) open subcover.
; sharp{{anchor|sharp}}: Often, a mathematical theorem will establish constraints on the behavior of some object; for example, a function will be shown to have an upper or lower bound.  The constraint is ''sharp'' (sometimes ''optimal'') if it cannot be made more restrictive without failing in some cases. For example, for [[#arbitrary|arbitrary]] nonnegative real numbers ''x'', the exponential function ''e&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;'', where ''e''&amp;nbsp;= 2.7182818..., gives an upper bound on the values of the quadratic function ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This is not sharp; the gap between the functions is everywhere at least 1. Among the exponential functions of the form α&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;, setting α&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''e''&lt;sup&gt;2/''e''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 2.0870652... results in a sharp upper bound; the slightly smaller choice α&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 fails to produce an upper bound, since then α&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 8&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In applied fields the word "tight" is often used with the same meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyd|first=Stephen|title=Convex Optimization|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521833787}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
; [[smooth function|smooth]]{{anchor|smooth}}: ''Smoothness'' is a concept which mathematics has endowed with many meanings, from simple differentiability to infinite differentiability to analyticity, and still others which are more complicated.  Each such usage attempts to invoke the physically intuitive notion of smoothness.
; strong, stronger{{anchor|strong|stronger}}&lt;!-- This anchor is linked from [[Intransitivity]] --&gt;: A theorem is said to be ''strong'' if it deduces restrictive results from general hypotheses. One celebrated example is [[Donaldson's theorem]], which puts tight restraints on what would otherwise appear to be a large class of manifolds.  This (informal) usage reflects the opinion of the mathematical community: not only should such a theorem be strong in the descriptive sense (below) but it should also be definitive in its area.  A theorem, result, or condition is further called ''stronger'' than another one if a proof of the second can be easily obtained from the first but not conversely. An example is the sequence of theorems: [[Fermat's little theorem]], [[Euler's theorem]], [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's theorem]], each of which is stronger than the last; another is that a sharp upper bound (see ''sharp'' above) is a stronger result than a non-sharp one.  Finally, the adjective ''strong'' or the adverb ''strongly'' may be added to a mathematical notion to indicate a related stronger notion; for example, a [[strong antichain]] is an [[antichain]] satisfying certain additional conditions, and likewise a [[strongly regular graph]] is a [[regular graph]] meeting stronger conditions. When used in this way, the  stronger notion (such as "strong antichain") is a technical term with a precisely defined meaning; the nature of the extra conditions cannot be derived from the definition of the weaker notion (such as "antichain").
; [[sufficiently large]], suitably small, sufficiently close{{anchor|sufficiently large|suitably small|sufficiently close}}: In the context of limits, these terms refer to some (unspecified, even unknown) point at which a phenomenon prevails as the limit is approached. A statement such as that predicate ''P'' holds for sufficiently large values, can be expressed in more formal notation by ∃''x'' : ∀''y'' ≥ ''x'' : ''P''(''y'').  See also ''eventually''.
; upstairs, downstairs{{anchor|upstairs|downstairs}}: A descriptive term referring to notation in which two objects are written one above the other; the upper one is ''upstairs'' and the lower, ''downstairs''.  For example, in a [[fiber bundle]], the total space is often said to be ''upstairs'', with the base space ''downstairs''.  In a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]], the numerator is occasionally referred to as ''upstairs'' and the [[denominator]] ''downstairs'', as in "bringing a term upstairs".
; [[up to]], modulo, mod out by{{anchor|up to|modulo|mod out by}}: An extension to mathematical discourse of the notions of [[modular arithmetic]].  A statement is true ''up to'' a condition if the establishment of that condition is the only impediment to the truth of the statement. Also used when working with members of equivalence classes, esp. in [[category theory]], where the equivalence relation is (categorical) isomorphism; for example, "The tensor product in a weak monoidal category is associative and unital up to a natural isomorphism."
; vanish{{anchor|vanish}}: To assume the value 0. For example, "The function sin(''x'') vanishes for those values of ''x'' that are integer multiples of π." This can also apply to limits: see [[Vanish at infinity]].
; weak, weaker{{anchor|weak|weaker}}: The converse of [[Mathematical jargon#strong|strong]].
; well-defined{{anchor|well-defined}}: Accurately and precisely described or specified. For example, sometimes a definition relies on a choice of some object; the result of the definition must then be independent of this choice.

==Proof terminology==
The formal language of [[proof (mathematics)|proof]] draws repeatedly from a small pool of ideas, many of which are invoked through various lexical shorthands in practice.
; aliter{{anchor|aliter}}: An obsolescent term which is used to announce to the reader an alternative method, or proof of a result. In a proof, it therefore flags a piece of reasoning that is superfluous from a logical point of view, but has some other interest.
; [[proof by contradiction|by way of contradiction]] (BWOC), or "for, if not, ..."{{anchor|by way of contradiction|BWOC}}: The rhetorical prelude to a [[proof by contradiction]], preceding the negation of the statement to be proved. Also, starting a proof or a sub-proof with ''Assume...'' indicates that a proof by contradiction will be employed.
; [[Iff#More general usage|if and only if]] (iff){{anchor|if and only if|iff}}: An abbreviation for [[logical equivalence]] of statements.
; in general{{anchor|in general}}&lt;!-- [[In general]] redirects here --&gt;: In the context of proofs, this phrase is often seen in [[mathematical induction|induction]] arguments when passing from the base case to the "induction step", and similarly, in the definition of [[sequence (mathematics)|sequence]]s whose first few terms are exhibited as examples of the formula giving every term of the sequence.
; [[necessary and sufficient]]{{anchor|necessary and sufficient}}: A minor variant on "if and only if"; "A is ''necessary'' (''sufficient'') for B" means "A if (only if) B".  For example, "For a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' to be [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]] it is necessary and sufficient that it have no finite [[field extension]]s" means "''K'' is algebraically closed if and only if it has no finite extensions".  Often used in lists, as in "The following conditions are necessary and sufficient for a field to be algebraically closed...".
; need to show (NTS), required to prove (RTP), wish to show, want to show (WTS){{anchor|need to show}}: Proofs sometimes proceed by enumerating several conditions whose satisfaction will together imply the desired theorem; thus, one ''needs to show'' just these statements.
; [[one and only one]]{{anchor|one and only one}}: A statement of the uniqueness of an object; the object exists, and furthermore, no other such object exists.
; [[Q.E.D.]]{{anchor|Q.E.D.}}: (''Quod erat demonstrandum''): A Latin abbreviation, meaning "which was to be demonstrated", historically placed at the end of proofs, but less common currently, having been supplanted by the [[Tombstone (typography)|Halmos end-of-proof mark]], a square sign ∎.
; sufficiently nice{{anchor|sufficiently nice}}: A condition on objects in the scope of the discussion, to be specified later, that will guarantee that some stated property holds for them. When [[heuristics|working out]] a theorem, the use of this expression in the statement of the theorem indicates that the conditions involved may be not yet known to the speaker, and that the intent is to collect the conditions that will be found to be needed in order for the proof of the theorem to go through.
; the following are equivalent (TFAE){{anchor|the following are equivalent|TFAE}}&lt;!-- [[TFAE]] redirects here --&gt;: Often several equivalent conditions (especially for a definition, such as [[normal subgroup]]) are equally useful in practice; one introduces a theorem stating an equivalence of more than two statements with TFAE.
; [[transport of structure]]{{anchor|transport of structure}}: It is often the case that two objects are shown to be equivalent in some way, and that one of them is endowed with additional structure.  Using the equivalence, we may define such a structure on the second object as well, via ''transport of structure''.  For example, any two [[vector space]]s of the same dimension are isomorphic; if one of them is given an [[inner product]] and if we fix a particular isomorphism, then we may define an inner product on the other space by ''factoring through'' the isomorphism.
{{quote|1=Let ''V'' be a finite-dimensional vector space over ''k''....Let (''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;1&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''i''&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; be a basis for ''V''....There is an isomorphism of the polynomial algebra ''k''[''T''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;1&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''i'',''j''&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; onto the algebra Sym&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''V''&amp;nbsp;&amp;otimes;&amp;nbsp;''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)....It extends to an isomorphism of ''k''['''GL'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] to the localized algebra Sym&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''V''&amp;nbsp;&amp;otimes;&amp;nbsp;''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''D''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;det(''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;otimes;&amp;nbsp;''e''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)....We write ''k''['''GL'''(''V'')] for this last algebra.

; [[Without loss of generality|without (any) loss of generality]] (WLOG, WOLOG, WALOG), we may assume (WMA){{anchor|WLOG|WOLOG|WALOG|we may assume|WMA}}: Sometimes a proposition can be more easily proved with additional assumptions on the objects it concerns.  If the proposition as stated follows from this modified one with a simple and minimal explanation (for example, if the remaining special cases are identical but for notation), then the modified assumptions are introduced with this phrase and the altered proposition is proved.

==Proof techniques==
Mathematicians have several phrases to describe proofs or proof techniques. These are often used as hints for filling in tedious details.

; angle chasing{{anchor|angle chasing}}: Used to describe a geometrical proof that involves finding relationships between the various angles in a diagram.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Elementary Geometry|first=John|last=Roe
|publisher=Oxford science publications|year=1993|isbn=0-19-853456-6|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[back-of-the-envelope calculation]]{{anchor|back-of-the-envelope calculation}}: An informal computation omitting much rigor without sacrificing correctness.  Often this computation is "proof of concept" and treats only an accessible special case.
; brute force{{anchor|brute force}}: Rather than finding underlying principles or patterns, this is a method where one would evaluate as many cases as needed to sufficiently prove or provide convincing evidence that the thing in question is true. Sometimes this involves evaluating every possible case.
; by example{{anchor|by example}}: A ''proof by example'' is an argument whereby a statement is not proved but instead illustrated by an example. If done well, the specific example would easily generalize to a general proof.
; by inspection{{anchor|by inspection}}: A rhetorical shortcut made by authors who invite the reader to verify, at a glance, the correctness of a proposed expression or deduction. If an expression can be evaluated by straightforward application of simple techniques and without recourse to extended calculation or general theory, then it can be evaluated ''by inspection''. It is also applied to solving equations; for example to find roots of a [[quadratic equation]] by inspection is to 'notice' them, or mentally check them. 'By inspection' can play a kind of ''[[wikt:gestalt|gestalt]]'' role: the answer or solution simply clicks into place.
; [[proof by intimidation|by intimidation]]{{anchor|by intimidation}}: Style of proof where claims believed by the author to be easily verifiable are labelled as 'obvious' or 'trivial', which often results in the reader being confused.
; clearly, can be easily shown{{anchor|clearly}}: A term which shortcuts around calculation the mathematician perceives to be tedious or routine, accessible to any member of the audience with the necessary expertise in the field; [[Pierre Laplace|Laplace]] used ''obvious'' ([[French language|French]]: ''évident'').
; complete intuition {{anchor|complete intuition}}: commonly reserved for jokes (puns on [[complete induction]]).
; [[diagram chasing]]{{anchor|diagram chasing|diagram chase}}:&lt;ref&gt;Numerous examples can be found in {{Harvard citations|last = Mac Lane|year = 1998}}, for example on p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Given a [[commutative diagram]] of objects and morphisms between them, if one wishes to prove some property of the morphisms (such as [[injectivity]]) which can be stated in terms of [[element (category theory)|element]]s, then the proof can proceed by tracing the path of elements of various objects around the diagram as successive morphisms are applied to it.  That is, one ''chases'' elements around the diagram, or does a ''diagram chase''.
; [[handwaving]]{{anchor|handwaving}}: A non-technique of proof mostly employed in lectures, where formal argument is not strictly necessary.  It proceeds by omission of details or even significant ingredients, and is merely a plausibility argument.
; in general{{anchor|in general (informal proof technique)}}: In a context not requiring rigor, this phrase often appears as a labor-saving device when the technical details of a complete argument would outweigh the conceptual benefits.  The author gives a proof in a simple enough case that the computations are reasonable, and then indicates that "in general" the proof is similar.
; index battle{{anchor|index battle}}: for proofs involving objects with multiple indices which can be solved by going to the bottom (if anyone wishes to take up the effort). Similar to diagram chasing.
; [[trivial (mathematics)|trivial]]{{anchor|trivial}}: Similar to ''clearly''.  A concept is trivial if it holds by definition, is immediate corollary to a known statement, or is a simple special case of a more general concept.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2302">In [[combinatorics|combinatorial mathematics]], the '''Lobb number''' ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''m'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt; counts the number of ways that ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''m'' open parentheses and ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''m'' close parentheses can be arranged to form the start of a valid sequence of [[Dyck language|balanced parentheses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Lobb numbers form a natural generalization of the [[Catalan number]]s, which count the number of complete strings of balanced parentheses of a given length. Thus, the ''n''th Catalan number equals the Lobb number ''L''&lt;sub&gt;0,''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| first1 = Thomas
| title= Catalan Numbers with Applications

| isbn = 978-0-19-533454-8
}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are named after Andrew Lobb, who used them  to give a simple [[mathematical induction|inductive proof]] of the formula for the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Catalan number.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

| journal = [[Mathematical Gazette]]
| volume = 83
| issue = 8
| pages = 109–110
|date=March 1999
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lobb numbers are parameterized by two non-negative [[integers]] ''m'' and ''n'' with ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0.  The (''m'',&amp;nbsp;''n'')&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Lobb number ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''m'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is given in terms of [[binomial coefficient]]s by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;L_{m,n} = \frac{2m+1}{m+n+1}\binom{2n}{m+n} \qquad\text{ for }n \ge m \ge 0.&lt;/math&gt;

As well as counting sequences of parentheses, the Lobb numbers also count the number of ways in which ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''m'' copies of the value +1 and ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''m'' copies of the value −1 may be arranged into a sequence such that all of the [[partial sum]]s of the sequence are non-negative.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3792">'''Logical harmony''', a name coined by [[Michael Dummett]], is a supposed constraint on the [[rules of inference]] that can be used in a given [[logical system]].

==Overview&lt;!--'Prior's tonk' redirects here--&gt;==
The logician [[Gerhard Gentzen]] proposed that the meanings of logical [[Logical connective|connective]]s could be given by the rules for introducing them into discourse. For example, if one believes that ''the sky is blue'' and one also believes that ''grass is green'', then one can introduce the connective ''[[logical conjunction|and]]'' as follows: ''The sky is blue AND grass is green.''  Gentzen's idea was that having rules like this is what gives meaning to one's words, or at least to certain words. The idea has also been associated with [[Wittgenstein]]'s dictum that in many cases we can say, ''[[meaning is use]]''. Most contemporary logicians prefer to think that the [[introduction rule]]s and the [[elimination rule]]s for an expression are equally important.  In this case, ''and'' is  characterized by the following rules:
{| border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" align="center"
|-
! Intro
! colspan="2" | Elim
|-
|
{| border="0"
|-
| &lt;VAR&gt;P&lt;/VAR&gt; || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || &lt;VAR&gt;Q&lt;/VAR&gt;
|-
| colspan="4" style="border-top:2px solid black;" |
|-
| colspan="4" align="center" | &lt;VAR&gt;P&lt;/VAR&gt; and &lt;VAR&gt;Q&lt;/VAR&gt;
|}
|
{| border="0"
|-
| &lt;VAR&gt;P&lt;/VAR&gt; and &lt;VAR&gt;Q&lt;/VAR&gt;
|-
| style="border-top:2px solid black;" |
|-
| align="center"| &lt;VAR&gt;P&lt;/VAR&gt;
|}
|
{| border="0"
|-
| &lt;VAR&gt;P&lt;/VAR&gt; and &lt;VAR&gt;Q&lt;/VAR&gt;
|-
| style="border-top:2px solid black;" |
|-
| align="center"| &lt;VAR&gt;Q&lt;/VAR&gt;
|}
|}

An apparent problem with this was pointed out by [[Arthur Prior]]: Why can't we have an expression (call it "'''tonk'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;") whose introduction rule is that of OR (from "p" to "p tonk q") but whose elimination rule is that of AND (from "p tonk q" to "q")?  This lets us deduce anything at all from any starting point.  Prior suggested that this meant that inferential rules could ''not'' determine meaning.  He was answered by [[Nuel Belnap]], that even though introduction and elimination rules can constitute meaning, not just any pair of such rules will determine a meaningful expression—they must meet certain constraints, such as not allowing us to deduce any new truths in the old vocabulary.  These constraints are what Dummett was referring to.

Harmony, then, refers to certain constraints that a proof theory must let hold between introduction and elimination rules for it to be meaningful, or in other words, for its inference rules to be meaning-constituting.

The application of harmony to logic may be considered a special case; it makes sense to talk of harmony with respect to not only inferential systems, but also conceptual systems in human cognition, and to type systems in programming languages.

Semantics of this form has not provided a very great challenge to that sketched in Tarski's [[semantic theory of truth]], but many philosophers interested in reconstituting the semantics of logic in a way that respects [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s ''meaning is use'' have felt that harmony holds the key.

'''Louis Necker''', called '''de Germany''' (31 August 1730 in Geneva – 31 July 1804 in [[Cologny]]) was a [[Republic and Canton of Geneva#History|Genevan]] mathematician, physicist, professor and a banker in Paris. He was the elder brother of [[Jacques Necker]], minister of Finance in France when the French Revolution broke out. 

== Biography ==

Louis Necker studied mathematics and physics at the [[Academy of Geneva]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rde_0769-0886_1990_num_8_1_1057 Frank A. Kafker :  ''Notices sur les auteurs des 17 volumes de « discours » de l'Encyclopédie (suite et fin).''  Recherches sur Diderot et sur l'Encyclopédie Année 1990 Volume 8 Numéro 8 p. 107].&lt;/ref&gt; He finished his studies in philosophy with a thesis on electricity (1747), then graduated in law (1751). For a while he became the governor of probably [[Charles Christian, Prince of Nassau-Weilburg]] and [[Simon August, Count of Lippe-Detmold]] during their stay in Geneva and traveled with them to the University of Turin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=FZY1SmV_ArYC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=Lippe-Detmold+Louis+Necker&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6aS7uVCvIY&amp;sig=xmya3pBcWBX5AqCyLAsGYP-NljM&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiPz8eusc_eAhUKMewKHUdUDVAQ6AEwAXoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Lippe-Detmold%20Louis%20Necker&amp;f=false Madame de Staël: Her Friends, and Her Influence in Politics and Literature by Charlotte Blennerhassett, p. 5]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=-VsmDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT21&amp;lpg=PT21&amp;dq=Lippe-Detmold+Louis+Necker&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=D2n7sLENgy&amp;sig=i1VNYDnwhun_Rlz8e6TzU6zQ74g&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiPz8eusc_eAhUKMewKHUdUDVAQ6AEwBHoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Louis%20Necker&amp;f=false Necker by Ghislain de DIESBACH]&lt;/ref&gt; He managed a boarding school for young English held by his father Charles Frederick, lawyer and professor of law at the Geneva Academy. He was appointed as the [[hofmeister (office)|hofmeister]] of a Baron van [[Van Wassenaer]] and a [[Bentinck]]. 

In 1752 he purchased {{Interlanguage link multi|Jean Jallabert|fr}}'s physics laboratory and in 1757 acceded the chair of mathematics and the honorary chair of Experimental Physics of the Academy of Geneva. As a correspondent of the [[Académie royale des sciences]] he had written an article for the Encyclopedia on [[Friction]] in mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://artflsrv03.uchicago.edu/philologic4/kafker/navigate/1/98/ The Encyclopedists as individuals: a biographical dictionary of the authors of the Encyclopédie]&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1759 he lost his wife Isabelle André, whom he had married in 1752 and came from Marseille. In 1761 he was forced to resign from his professorship after a scandal (Vernes-Necker case).&lt;ref&gt;https://artflsrv03.uchicago.edu/philologic4/kafker/navigate/1/98/&lt;/ref&gt;  
In 1762 with the help of his brother he was appointed in a trading house in Marseille and added to his last name de Germany, after the family estate near [[Rolle]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=FZY1SmV_ArYC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=Lippe-Detmold+Louis+Necker&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6aS7uVCvIY&amp;sig=xmya3pBcWBX5AqCyLAsGYP-NljM&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiPz8eusc_eAhUKMewKHUdUDVAQ6AEwAXoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Lippe-Detmold%20Louis%20Necker&amp;f=false Madame de Staël: Her Friends, and Her Influence in Politics and Literature by Charlotte Blennerhassett, p. 5]&lt;/ref&gt; He was dropped from the Académie des sciences's list of Corresponding Members in 1767.

In 1770 he moved to Paris. In 1772 he became a banker at {{Interlanguage link multi|Banque Girardot|fr|3=Banque Girardot|lt=Girardot Bank}}. In 1773 he remarried. Between 1774 and 1778 he must have been very busy collecting interest for his rich and noble clients in [[Utrecht]], the Netherlands. An astonishing number of notarial deeds are on his name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hetutrechtsarchief.nl/onderzoek/resultaten/archieven/zoekresultaat?mistart=68&amp;mivast=39&amp;mizig=236&amp;miadt=39&amp;miaet=54&amp;micode=34-4.U256c014&amp;milang=nl&amp;misort=last_mod%7Cdesc&amp;miview=ldt&amp;mizk_alle=Louis%20Necker&amp;mibj=1750&amp;miej=1800 Utrecht Archief]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1776 he became [[resident (title)|resident]] for the [[Republic of Geneva]], succeeding his brother. When Emmanuel Haller was appointed in the Girardot bank in 1777, Louis became a silent partner. At some time (1777?) he became a friend of [[Benjamin Franklin]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-24-02-0314]&lt;/ref&gt; Jacques Necker was dismissed on 19 May 1781 as controller of the royal treasury. It seems the brothers were still cooperating as Jacques and Louis received annually 8 million livres as a pension.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k9766891m/f1n300.pdf?download=1 Othénin d’Haussonville (2004) “La liquidation du ‘dépôt’ de Necker: entre concept et idée-force,”, p. 204 Cahiers staëliens, 55]&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a result of changes during the liberal phase of the [[French Revolution]], he thought it prudent to return to his homeland in 1791. The disgrace of his younger brother Jacques, who resigned in 1790, contributed to his decision. The Neckers were far from welcome in Geneva. Many of the French émigrés considered them Jacobins, and many of the Swiss Jacobins thought them conservative.&lt;ref&gt;[https://artflsrv03.uchicago.edu/philologic4/kafker/navigate/1/98/ The Encyclopedists as individuals: a biographical dictionary of the authors of the Encyclopédie]&lt;/ref&gt;

His son Jacques (1757-1825), who had joined the French army, married [[Albertine Necker de Saussure]] in 1785. The French Revolution ended his military career. In 1790, he began teaching as a demonstrator in botany at the [[Academy of Geneva]] as Professor of Botany.

'''''Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences''''' is a 1966 textbook by [[mathematician]] [[Mary L. Boas]] intended to develop skills in mathematical problem solving needed for junior to senior-graduate courses in [[engineering]], [[physics]], and [[chemistry]]. The book provides a comprehensive survey of [[mathematical physics|analytic techniques]] and provides careful statements of important theorems while omitting most detailed proofs. Each section contains a large number of problems, with selected answers. [[Computational physics|Numerical computational approaches]] using computers are outside the scope of the book.

The book, now in its third edition, was still widely used in university classrooms as of 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spector|first=Donald|title=Book Reviews|journal=[[American Journal of Physics]]|year=1999|volume=67|issue=2|pages=165–169|doi=10.1119/1.19216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek and Chinese perspectives |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
'''Mathematical practice''' comprises the working practices of professional [[mathematician]]s: selecting [[theorem]]s to prove, using informal notations to persuade themselves and others that various steps in the final proof are convincing, and seeking [[peer review]] and [[publication]], as opposed to the end result of [[mathematical proof|proven]] and published [[theorem]]s.

[[Philip Kitcher]] has proposed a more formal definition of a mathematical practice, as a quintuple. His intention was primarily to document mathematical practice through its historical changes.&lt;ref name="Ernest1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ernest|first=Paul|title=Social Constructivism as a Philosophy of Mathematics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TYeEjbRSAvQC&amp;pg=PA139|accessdate=19 September 2018|year=1998|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791435885|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical tradition==
{{unsourced|section|date=October 2018}}

The evolution of mathematical practice was slow, and some contributors to modern mathematics did not follow even the practice of their time.  For example, [[Pierre de Fermat]] was infamous for withholding his proofs, but nonetheless had a vast reputation for correct assertions of results.

One motivation to study mathematical practice is that, despite much work in the 20th century, some still feel that the [[foundations of mathematics]] remain unclear and ambiguous. One proposed remedy is to shift focus to some degree onto 'what is meant by a proof', and other such questions of method.

If mathematics has been informally used throughout history, in numerous cultures and continents, then it could be argued that "mathematical practice" is the practice, or use, of mathematics in everyday life.  One definition of mathematical practice, as described above, is the "working practices of professional mathematicians."  However, another definition, more in keeping with the predominant usage of mathematics, is that mathematical practice is the everyday practice, or use, of math.  Whether one is estimating the total cost of their groceries, calculating miles per gallon, or figuring out how many minutes on the treadmill that chocolate éclair will require, math as used by most people relies less on proof than on practicality (i. e., does it answer the question?).

==Teaching practice==
[[Mathematical teaching]] usually requires the use of several important teaching [[pedagogy|pedagogies]] or components.  Most [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE]], [[A-Level]] and [[undergraduate]] mathematics require the following components: 
# [[Textbook]]s or lecture notes which display the mathematical material to be covered/taught within the context of the teaching of mathematics.  This requires that the mathematical content being taught at the (say) undergraduate level is of a well documented and widely accepted nature that has been unanimously verified as being correct and meaningful within a mathematical context.
# Workbooks.  Usually, in order to ensure that students have an opportunity to learn and test the material that they have learnt, workbooks or question papers enable mathematical understanding to be tested.  It is not unknown for exam papers to draw upon questions from such test papers, or to require [[prerequisite]] knowledge of such test papers for mathematical progression.
# Exam papers and standardised (and preferably apolitical) testing methods.  Often, within countries such as the US, the UK (and, in all likelihood, China) there are standardised qualifications, examinations and workbooks that form the concrete teaching materials needed for secondary-school and pre-university courses (for example, within the UK, all students are required to sit or take Scottish Highers/Advanced Highers, A-levels or their equivalent in order to ensure that a certain minimal level of mathematical competence in a wide variety of topics has been obtained).  Note, however, that at the undergraduate, [[post-graduate]] and [[doctoral]] levels within these countries, there need not be any standardised process via which mathematicians of differing ability levels can be tested or examined. Other common test formats within the UK and beyond include the [[British Mathematical Olympiad|BMO]] (which is a multiple-choice test competition paper used in order to determine the best candidates that are to represent countries within the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10303">In the [[scale-free network]] theory ([[network theory|mathematical theory of networks]] or [[graph theory]]), a '''mediation-driven attachment (MDA) model''' appears to embody a [[preferential attachment]] rule tacitly rather than explicitly. According to MDA rule, a new node first picks a node from the existing network at random and connect itself not with that but with one of the neighbors also picked at random.

Barabasi and Albert in 1999 noted through their seminal paper &lt;ref&gt;A. -L. Barab\'{a}si and R. Albert, Science '''286''' 509 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; noted that (i) most natural and man-made  networks are not static, rather they grow with time and (ii) new nodes do not connect with an already connected one randomly rather preferentially with respect to their degrees. The later mechanism is called preferential attachment (PA) rule which embodies the rich get richer phenomena in economics. In their first model, known as the [[Barabási–Albert model]], Barabási and Albert (BA model) choose

: &lt;math&gt; \Pi(i) = \frac{k_i}{\sum_{j=1} k_j}&lt;/math&gt;

where, &lt;math&gt;\Pi(i)&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that the new node picks a node &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; from the labelled nodes of the existing network. It directly embodies the rich get richer mechanism.

Recently, Hassan ''et al.'' proposed a mediation-driven attachment model which appears to embody the PA rule but not directly rather in disguise.&lt;ref&gt;M. K. Hassan, Liana Islam and Syed Arefinul Haque, Degree distribution, rank-size distribution, and leadership persistence in mediation-driven attachment networks Physica A 469 23 (2017) https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2016.11.001&lt;/ref&gt; In the MDA model, an incoming node choose an existing node to connect by first picking one of the existing nodes at random which is regarded as mediator. The new node then connect with one of the neighbors of the mediator which is also picked at random. Now the question is: What is the probability &lt;math&gt;\Pi(i)&lt;/math&gt; that an already existing node &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is finally picked to connect it with the new node? Say, the node &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; has degree &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; and hence it has &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; neighbors. Consider that the neighbors of  &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; are labeled &lt;math&gt;1,2,\ldots ,k_i&lt;/math&gt; which have degrees &lt;math&gt;k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_{k_i}&lt;/math&gt; respectively. One can reach the node &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; from each of these &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; nodes with probabilities inverse of their respective degrees, and each of the &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; nodes are likely to be picked at random with probability &lt;math&gt;1/N&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the probability &lt;math&gt;\Pi(i)&lt;/math&gt; of the MDA model is:

:&lt;math&gt;\Pi(i)= \frac 1 N \left[ \frac 1 {k_1}+ \frac 1 {k_2} + \cdots + \frac 1 {k_{k_i}} \right] =\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{k_i} \frac 1 {k_j}} N.&lt;/math&gt;
It can be re-written as

: &lt;math&gt;\Pi(i) = \frac{k_i}N \cdot \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{k_i} \frac 1 {k_j}}{k_i},&lt;/math&gt;

where the factor &lt;math&gt;\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{k_i}{\frac{1}{k_j}}}{k_i}&lt;/math&gt; is the inverse of the harmonic mean (IHM) of degrees of the &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; neighbors of the node &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. Extensive numerical simulation suggest that for small &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; the IHM value of each node fluctuate so wildly that the mean of the IHM values over the entire network bears no meaning. However, for large &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; (specially &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; approximately greater than 14) the distribution of IHM value of the entire network become left skewed Gaussian type and mean starts to have a meaning which becomes a constant value in the large &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; limit. In this limit one finds that &lt;math&gt;\Pi(i)\propto k_i&lt;/math&gt; which is exactly the PA rule. It implies that the higher the links (degree) a node has, the higher its chance of gaining more links since they can be reached in a larger number of ways through mediators which essentially embodies the intuitive idea of rich get richer mechanism. Therefore, the MDA network can be seen to follow the PA rule but in disguise. Moreover, for small &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; the MFA is no longer valid rather the attachment probability &lt;math&gt;\Pi(i)&lt;/math&gt; becomes super-preferential in character.

The idea of MDA rule can be found in the growth process of the [[weighted planar stochastic lattice (WPSL)]]. An existing node (the center of each block of the WPSL is regarded as nodes and the common border between blocks as the links between the corresponding nodes) during the process gain links only if one of its neighbor is picked not itself. It implies that the higher the links (or degree) a node has, the higher its chance of gaining more links since they can be reached in a larger number of ways. It essentially embodies the intuitive idea of PA rule. Therefore, the dual of the WPSL is a network which can be seen to follow preferential attachment rule but in disguise. Indeed, its degree distribution is found to exhibit power-law as underlined by Barabasi and Albert as one of the essential ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;M. K. Hassan, M. Z. Hassan and N. I. Pavel, “Scale-free network topology and multifractality in a  weighted planar stochastic lattice” New Journal of Physics '''12''' 093045 ( 2010) http://doi:10{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.1088/1367-2630/12/9/093045&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. K. Hassan, M. Z. Hassan and N. I. Pavel, Scale-free coordination number disorder and multifractal size disorder in weighted planar stochastic lattice, J. Phys: Conf. Ser, '''297''' 012010 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mediation-driven attachment network of size 256 nodes.pdf|thumb|Mediation-driven attachment network of size 256 nodes]]

[[Degree distribution:]] The two factors that the mean of the IHM is meaningful and it is independent of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; 
implies that one can apply the mean-field approximation (MFA). That is, within this approximation one can replace the true IHM value &lt;math&gt;\beta/m&lt;/math&gt; of each node by their mean, where the factor &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; that the number of edges the new nodes come with is introduced for latter convenience. The rate equation to solve then becomes exactly like that of the BA model and hence the network that emerges following MDA rule is also [[scale-free]] in nature. The only difference is that the exponent &lt;math&gt;\gamma={{1}\over{\beta(m)}}+1&lt;/math&gt; depends on &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; where as in the BA model &lt;math&gt;\gamma=3&lt;/math&gt; independent of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Deg dist gm-page-0.jpg|thumb|Plots of degree distribution for the MDA model. The distinct plots are for incoming nodes coming edges ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;15 and ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;100. In the inset we show the variation in the exponent of the degree distribution as a function of&amp;nbsp;''m''.]]

==Leadership persistence probability==
In the growing network not all nodes are equally important. The extent of their importance is measured by the value of their degree &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. Nodes which are linked to an unusually large number of other nodes, i.e. nodes with exceptionally high &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; value, are known as hubs. They are special because their existence make the mean distance, measured in units of the number of links, between nodes incredibly small thereby playing the key role in spreading rumors, opinions, diseases, computer viruses etc.&lt;ref&gt;R. Pastor-Satorras, A. Vespignani., Phys. Rev. Lett. '''86''' 3200(2001).&lt;/ref&gt; It is, therefore, important to know the properties of the largest hub, which we regard as the leader. Like in society, the leadership in a growing network is not permanent. That is, once a node becomes the leader, it does not mean that it remains the leader ''ad infinitum''. An interesting question is: how long does the leader retain this leadership property as the network evolves? To find an answer to this question, we define the leadership persistence probability &lt;math&gt;F(\tau)&lt;/math&gt; that aleader retains its leadership for at least up to time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. Persistence probability has been of interest in many different systems ranging from coarsening dynamics to fluctuating interfaces or polymer chains.

[[File:Persistence-page-0.jpg|thumb|The two plots at the top reveal the power-law behavior of the leadership persistence probability. To appreciate the role of m we give leadership persistence probability for two values (m=1 and m=100) in the same plot: (a) BA networks and (b) MDA networks. The two plots at the bottom are for the persistence exponent as a function of m in (c) BA networks and (d) MDA networks.]]

The basic idea of the MDA rule is, however not completely new as either this or models similar to this can be found in a few earlier works, albeit their approach, ensuing analysis and their results are different from ours. For instance, Saramaki and Kaski presented a random-walk based model.&lt;ref&gt;Saramaki and K. Kaski, Physica A '''341''', 80 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  Another model proposed by Boccaletti  ''et al.'' may appear similar to ours, but it markedly differs on closer look.&lt;ref&gt;S. Boccaletti, D.-U. Hwang and V. Latora, I. J. Bifurcation and Chaos '''17''' 2447  (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  Recently, Yang {\it et al.} too gave a form for &lt;math&gt;\Pi(i)&lt;/math&gt; and resorted to mean-field approximation.&lt;ref&gt;X.-H. Yang, S. -L. Lou, G. Chen, S.-Y. Chen, W. Huang, Physica A
'''392''' 3531 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the nature of their expressions are significantly different from the one studied by Hassan ''et al.''. Yet another closely related model is the Growing Network with Redirection (GNR) model presented by Gabel, Krapivsky and Redner where at each time step a new node either attaches to a randomly chosen target node with probability  &lt;math&gt;1-r&lt;/math&gt;, or to the parent of the target with probability  &lt;math&gt;r=1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;P. L. Krapivsky and S. Redner, Phys. Rev. E '''63''', 066123 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; The GNR model with &lt;math&gt;r=1&lt;/math&gt; may appear similar to the MDA model. However,  it should be noted that unlike the GNR model, the MDA model is for undirected networks, and that the new link can connect with any neighbor of the mediator-parent or not. One more difference is that, in the MDA model new node may join the existing network with &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; edges and in the GNR model it is considered &lt;math&gt;m=1&lt;/math&gt; case only.

In [[mathematics]], the method of considering a '''minimal counterexample''' combines the ideas of [[inductive proof]] and [[proof by contradiction]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Chartrand|Chartrand, Gary]], Albert D. Polimeni, and [[Ping Zhang (graph theorist)|Ping Zhang]]. Mathematical Proofs: A Transition to Advanced Mathematics. Boston: Pearson Education, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Abstractly, in trying to prove a proposition ''P'', one assumes that it is false, and that therefore there is at least one [[counterexample]]. With respect to some idea of size, which may need to be chosen skillfully, one assumes that there is such a counterexample ''C'' that is ''minimal''. We expect that ''C'' is something quite hypothetical (since we are trying to prove ''P''), but it may be possible to argue that if ''C'' existed, it would have some definite properties. From those we then try to get a contradiction. 

If the form of the contradiction is that we can derive a further counterexample ''D'', and that ''D'' is smaller than ''C'' in the sense of the working hypothesis of minimality, then this technique is traditionally called [[infinite descent]]. There may however be more complicated ways to argue. For example, the minimal counterexample method has been much used in the [[classification of finite simple groups]]. The [[Feit–Thompson theorem]], that finite simple groups that are not [[cyclic group]]s have even order, was based on the hypothesis of some, and therefore some minimal, simple group ''G'' of odd order. Every proper subgroup of ''G'' can be assumed a [[solvable group]], meaning that much theory of such subgroups could be applied.

The assumption that if there is a counterexample, there is a minimal counterexample, is based on a [[well-ordering]] of some kind. The usual ordering on the [[natural number]]s is clearly possible, by the most usual formulation of [[mathematical induction]]; but the scope of the method is [[well-ordered induction]] of any kind.

[[Fundamental theorem of arithmetic#Elementary proof of uniqueness|Euclid's proof of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] is a simple proof using a minimal counterexample.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6112">'''Minimum distance estimation (MDE)''' is a statistical method for fitting a mathematical model to data, usually the [[Empirical distribution function|empirical distribution]].

==Definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle X_1,\ldots,X_n&lt;/math&gt; be an [[Independent and identically-distributed random variables|independent and identically distributed]] (iid) [[Random variable|random]] [[Random sample|sample]] from a [[Statistical population|population]] with [[Cumulative distribution function|distribution]] &lt;math&gt;F(x;\theta)\colon \theta\in\Theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Theta\subseteq\mathbb{R}^k (k\geq 1)&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle F_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; be the [[empirical distribution function]] based on the sample.

Let &lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; be an [[estimator]] for &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \theta&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;F(x;\hat{\theta})&lt;/math&gt; is an estimator for &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle F(x;\theta)&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;d[\cdot,\cdot]&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Functional (mathematics)|functional]] returning some measure of [[Distance#General_case|"distance"]] between the two [[Dependent and independent variables#Mathematics|arguments]]. The functional &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle d&lt;/math&gt; is also called the criterion function.

If there exists a &lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}\in\Theta&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;d[F(x;\hat{\theta}),F_n(x)]=\inf\{d[F(x;\theta),F_n(x)]; \theta\in\Theta\}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''minimum distance estimate''' of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \theta&lt;/math&gt;.

==Statistics used in estimation==

Most theoretical studies of minimum distance estimation, and most applications, make use of "distance" measures which underlie already-established [[goodness of fit]] tests: the test statistic used in one of these tests is used as the distance measure to be minimised. Below are some examples of statistical tests that have been used for minimum distance estimation.

===Chi-square criterion===

The [[Pearson's chi-square test|chi-square test]] uses as its criterion the sum, over predefined groups, of the squared difference between the increases of the empirical distribution and the estimated distribution, weighted by the increase in the estimate for that group.

===Cramér–von Mises criterion===

The [[Cramér–von Mises criterion]] uses the integral of the squared difference between the empirical and the estimated distribution functions {{harv|Parr|Schucany|1980|p=616}}.

===Kolmogorov–Smirnov criterion===

The [[Kolmogorov–Smirnov test]] uses the [[supremum]] of the [[absolute difference]] between the empirical and the estimated distribution functions {{harv|Parr|Schucany|1980|p=616}}.

===Anderson–Darling criterion===

The [[Anderson–Darling test]] is similar to the Cramér–von Mises criterion except that the integral is of a weighted version of the squared difference, where the weighting relates the variance of the empirical distribution function {{harv|Parr|Schucany|1980|p=616}}.

==Theoretical results==

The theory of minimum distance estimation is related to that for the asymptotic distribution of the corresponding statistical [[goodness of fit]] tests. Often the cases of the [[Cramér–von Mises criterion]], the [[Kolmogorov–Smirnov test]] and the [[Anderson–Darling test]] are treated simultaneously by treating them as special cases of a more general formulation of a distance measure. Examples of the theoretical results that are available are: [[Consistency (statistics)|consistency]] of the parameter estimates; the asymptotic covariance matrices of the parameter estimates.

In [[mathematics]], the word '''null''' (from {{lang-de|null}} meaning "zero", which is from {{lang-la|nullus}} meaning "none")&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;{{cite journal |title="null" |journal=[[The Oxford English Dictionary]], Draft Revision March 2004 |url=http://dictionary.oed.com |year=2004 |accessdate=2007-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oald"&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of "null" adjective from the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary |journal=[[Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary]] 9th |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/null |year=2016 |accessdate=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; means of or related to having [[Empty set|zero members in a set]] or a value of [[zero]]. Sometimes the symbol '''∅''' is used to distinguish "null" from '''0'''.

In a [[norm (mathematics)|normed]] [[vector space]] the [[null vector]] is the zero vector; in a [[norm (mathematics)|seminormed]] vector space such as [[Minkowski space#Causal structure|Minkowski space]], null vectors are, in general, non-zero. In [[set theory]], the [[empty set|null set]] is the set with zero elements; and in [[measure theory]], a [[null set]] is a set with zero measure.

A [[null space]] of a mapping is the part of the domain that is mapped into the null element of the image (the inverse image of the null element).

In [[statistics]], a [[null hypothesis]] is a proposition presumed true unless statistical evidence indicates otherwise.

'''[[Stein's example]]''' is an important result in [[decision theory]] which can be stated as

: ''The ordinary decision rule for estimating the mean of a multivariate Gaussian distribution is inadmissible under mean squared error risk in dimension at least 3''.

The following is an outline of its proof. The reader is referred to the [[Stein's example|main article]] for more information.

==Sketched proof==
The [[risk function]] of the decision rule &lt;math&gt;d(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;R(\theta,d) = \mathbb{E}_\theta[ |\mathbf{\theta - X}|^2]&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;=\int (\mathbf{\theta - x})^T(\mathbf{\theta - x}) \left( \frac{1}{2\pi} \right)^{n/2} e^{(-1/2) (\mathbf{\theta - x})^T (\mathbf{\theta - x}) } m(dx)&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; = n.&lt;/math&gt;

Now consider the decision rule

:&lt;math&gt;d'(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{x} - \frac{\alpha}{|\mathbf{x}|^2}\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha = n-2&lt;/math&gt;. We will show that &lt;math&gt;d'&lt;/math&gt; is a better decision rule than &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;. The risk function is

:&lt;math&gt;R(\theta,d') = \mathbb{E}_\theta\left[ \left|\mathbf{\theta - X} + \frac{\alpha}{|\mathbf{X}|^2}\mathbf{X}\right|^2\right]&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; = \mathbb{E}_\theta\left[ |\mathbf{\theta - X}|^2 + 2(\mathbf{\theta - X})^T\frac{\alpha}{|\mathbf{X}|^2}\mathbf{X} + \frac{\alpha^2}{|\mathbf{X}|^4}|\mathbf{X}|^2 \right] &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; = \mathbb{E}_\theta\left[ |\mathbf{\theta - X}|^2 \right] + 2\alpha\mathbb{E}_\theta\left[\frac{\mathbf{(\theta-X)^T X}}{|\mathbf{X}|^2}\right] + \alpha^2\mathbb{E}_\theta\left[\frac{1}{|\mathbf{X}|^2} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

&amp;mdash; a quadratic in &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. We may simplify the middle term by considering a general "well-behaved" function &lt;math&gt;h:\mathbf{x} \mapsto h(\mathbf{x}) \in \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; and using [[integration by parts]]. For &lt;math&gt;1\leq i \leq n&lt;/math&gt;, for any continuously differentiable &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; growing sufficiently slowly for large &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; we have:

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}_\theta [ (\theta_i - X_i) h(\mathbf{X}) | X_j=x_j (j\neq i) ]= \int (\theta_i - x_i) h(\mathbf{x}) \left( \frac{1}{2\pi} \right)^{n/2} e^{ -(1/2)\mathbf{(x-\theta)}^T \mathbf{(x-\theta)} } m(dx_i)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;= \left[ h(\mathbf{x}) \left( \frac{1}{2\pi} \right)^{n/2} e^{-(1/2) \mathbf{(x-\theta)}^T \mathbf{(x-\theta)} } \right]^\infty_{x_i=-\infty}  
- \int  \frac{\partial h}{\partial x_i}(\mathbf{x}) \left( \frac{1}{2\pi} \right)^{n/2} e^{-(1/2)\mathbf{(x-\theta)}^T \mathbf{(x-\theta)} } m(dx_i)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; = - \mathbb{E}_\theta \left[ \frac{\partial h}{\partial x_i}(\mathbf{X})  | X_j=x_j (j\neq i) \right].
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}_\theta [ (\theta_i - X_i) h(\mathbf{X})]=  - \mathbb{E}_\theta \left[ \frac{\partial h}{\partial x_i}(\mathbf{X}) \right].&lt;/math&gt;

(This result is known as [[Stein's lemma]].)

Now, we choose

:&lt;math&gt;
h(\mathbf{x})  =  \frac{x_i}{|\mathbf{x}|^2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; met the "well-behaved" condition (it doesn't, but this can be remedied -- see below), we would have

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial h}{\partial x_i} = \frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}|^2} - \frac{2 x_i^2}{|\mathbf{x}|^4} &lt;/math&gt;

and so

::&lt;math&gt;
\mathbb{E}_\theta\left[\frac{\mathbf{(\theta-X)^T X}}{|\mathbf{X}|^2}\right] = \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{E}_\theta \left[ (\theta_i - X_i) \frac{X_i}{|\mathbf{X}|^2} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; = - \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{E}_\theta \left[ \frac{1}{|\mathbf{X}|^2} - \frac{2 X_i^2}{|\mathbf{X}|^4} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; = -(n-2)\mathbb{E}_\theta \left[\frac{1}{|\mathbf{X}|^2}\right].&lt;/math&gt;

Then returning to the risk function of &lt;math&gt;d'&lt;/math&gt; :

:&lt;math&gt;
R(\theta,d') =  n - 2\alpha(n-2)\mathbb{E}_\theta\left[\frac{1}{|\mathbf{X}|^2}\right] + \alpha^2\mathbb{E}_\theta\left[\frac{1}{|\mathbf{X}|^2} \right].
&lt;/math&gt;

This quadratic in &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is minimized at

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = n-2,&lt;/math&gt;

giving

:&lt;math&gt;R(\theta,d') = R(\theta,d) - (n-2)^2\mathbb{E}_\theta\left[\frac{1}{|\mathbf{X}|^2} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

which of course satisfies:

:&lt;math&gt;
R(\theta,d') &lt; R(\theta,d).
&lt;/math&gt;

making &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; an inadmissible decision rule.

It remains to justify the use of
:&lt;math&gt;
h(\mathbf{X})= \frac{\mathbf{X}}{|\mathbf{X}|^2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

This function is not continuously differentiable since it is singular at &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}=0&lt;/math&gt;. However the function

:&lt;math&gt;
h(\mathbf{X}) = \frac{\mathbf{X}}{\epsilon + |\mathbf{X}|^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

is continuously differentiable, and after following the algebra through and letting &lt;math&gt;\epsilon \to 0&lt;/math&gt; one obtains the same result.

A '''quantitative analyst''' (or, in financial jargon, a '''quant''') is a person who specializes in the application of mathematical and statistical methods – such as numerical or quantitative techniques – to financial and risk management problems.  The occupation is similar to those in [[industrial mathematics]] in other industries.&lt;ref&gt;See Definition in the Society for Applied and Industrial Mathematics http://www.siam.org/about/pdf/brochure.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the original quantitative analysts were "[[sell side]] quants" from market maker firms, concerned with [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] pricing and [[risk management]], the meaning of the term has expanded over time to include those individuals involved in almost any application of [[mathematical finance|mathematics in finance]], including the [[buy side]].&lt;ref&gt;Derman, E. (2004). My life as a quant: reflections on physics and finance. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include [[statistical arbitrage]], quantitative [[investment management]], [[algorithmic trading]],  and electronic market making. 

==History==
[[File:Robert C. Merton.jpg|thumb|[[Robert C. Merton]], one of the pioneers of quantitative analysis, promoted [[stochastic calculus]] into the study of finance.]]
[[Quantitative finance]] started in 1900 with [[Louis Bachelier]]'s doctoral thesis ''Theory of Speculation'', which provided a model to price [[Option (finance)|options]] under a [[Normal Distribution]].

[[Harry Markowitz]]'s 1952 doctoral [[thesis]] "Portfolio Selection" and its published version was one of the first efforts in economics journals to formally adapt mathematical concepts to finance (mathematics was until then confined to mathematics, statistics or specialized economics journals).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Markowitz |first=H. |year=1952 |title=Portfolio Selection |journal=[[Journal of Finance]] |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=77–91 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-6261.1952.tb01525.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Markowitz formalized a notion of mean return and covariances for common stocks which allowed him to quantify the concept of "diversification" in a market. He showed how to compute the mean return and variance for a given portfolio and argued that investors should hold only those portfolios whose variance is minimal among all portfolios with a given mean return.  Although the language of finance now involves [[Itō calculus]], management of risk in a quantifiable manner underlies much of the modern theory.

In 1965 [[Paul Samuelson]] introduced [[stochastic calculus]] into the study of finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Samuelson |first=P. A. |year=1965 |title=Rational Theory of Warrant Pricing |journal=Industrial Management Review |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=13–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry McKean]] the co-founder of stochastic calculus (along with [[Kiyosi Itô]]) wrote the appendix: see {{cite journal |last=McKean |first=H. P. Jr. |year=1965 |title=Appendix (to Samuelson): a free boundary problem for the heat equation arising from a problem of mathematical economics |journal=Industrial Management Review |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=32–39 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1969 [[Robert C. Merton|Robert Merton]] promoted continuous stochastic calculus and [[continuous-time]] processes. Merton was motivated by the desire to understand how prices are set in financial markets, which is the classical economics question of "equilibrium," and in later papers he used the machinery of stochastic calculus to begin investigation of this issue.

At the same time as Merton's work and with Merton's assistance, [[Fischer Black]] and [[Myron Scholes]] developed the [[Black–Scholes model]], which was awarded the 1997 [[Nobel Prize in Economics|Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]].  It provided a solution for a practical problem, that of finding a fair price for a European call option, i.e., the right to buy one share of a given stock at a specified price and time.  Such options are frequently purchased by investors as a risk-hedging device. In 1981, Harrison and Pliska used the general theory of continuous-time stochastic processes to put the [[Black–Scholes]] model on a solid theoretical basis, and showed how to price numerous other derivative securities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harrison |first=J. Michael |last2=Pliska |first2=Stanley R. |title=Martingales and Stochastic Integrals in the Theory of Continuous Trading |journal=Stochastic Processes and their Applications |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=215–260 |year=1981 |doi=10.1016/0304-4149(81)90026-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emanuel Derman]]'s 2004 book ''My Life as a Quant'' helped to both make the role of a quantitative analyst better known outside of finance, and to popularize the abbreviation "quant" for a quantitative analyst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Derman |first=Emanuel |year=2004 |title=My Life as a Quant |publisher=John Wiley and Sons }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Quantitative analysts often come from applied mathematics, physics or engineering backgrounds rather than economics-related fields, and quantitative analysis is a major source of employment for people with mathematics and physics PhD degrees, or with financial mathematics [[Diplôme d'études approfondies|DEA]] degrees in the French education system.  Typically, a quantitative analyst will also need extensive skills in computer programming, most commonly [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[R (programming language)|R]], [[MATLAB]], [[Mathematica]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]].

This demand for quantitative analysts has led to a resurgence in demand for [[actuarial]] qualifications as well as creation of specialized Masters and PhD courses in [[financial engineering]], [[mathematical finance]], [[computational finance]], and/or [[financial reinsurance]].  In particular, Master's degrees in [[mathematical finance]], [[financial engineering]], [[operations research]], [[computational statistics]], [[machine Learning|machine learning]], and [[financial analysis]] are becoming more popular with students and with employers. See [[Master of Quantitative Finance]]; [[Master of Financial Economics]].

[[Data science]] and [[machine learning]] analysis and modelling methods are being increasingly employed in portfolio performance and portfolio risk modelling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marketsmedia.com/machine-learning-in-finance-theory-and-applications/|title=Machine Learning in Finance: Theory and Applications|author=|date=22 January 2013|website=marketsmedia.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qminitiative.org/UserFiles/files/S_Cl%C3%A9men%C3%A7on_ML.pdf|title=A Machine-Learning View of Quantitative Finance|author=|date=|website=qminitiative.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such data science and machine learning Master's graduates are also in demand as quantitative analysts.

===Front office quantitative analyst===
In sales &amp; trading, quantitative analysts work to determine prices, manage risk, and identify profitable opportunities. Historically this was a distinct activity from trading but the boundary between a desk quantitative analyst and a quantitative trader is increasingly blurred, and it is now difficult to enter trading as a profession without at least some quantitative analysis education. In the field of [[algorithmic trading]] it has reached the point where there is little meaningful difference. Front office work favours a higher speed to quality ratio, with a greater emphasis on solutions to specific problems than detailed modeling. FOQs typically are significantly better paid than those in back office, risk, and model validation. Although highly skilled analysts, FOQs frequently lack software engineering experience or formal training, and bound by time constraints and business pressures tactical solutions are often adopted.

===Quantitative investment management===
Quantitative analysis is used extensively by asset managers. Some, such as FQ, AQR or Barclays, rely almost exclusively on quantitative strategies while others, such as Pimco, Blackrock or Citadel use a mix of quantitative and fundamental methods.

===Library quantitative analysis===
Major firms invest large sums in an attempt to produce standard methods of evaluating prices and risk. These differ from front office tools in that Excel is very rare, with most development being in C++, though Java and C# are sometimes used in non-performance critical tasks. LQs spend more time modeling ensuring the analytics are both efficient and correct, though there is tension between LQs and FOQs on the validity of their results. LQs are required to understand techniques such as [[Monte Carlo methods]] and [[finite difference methods]], as well as the nature of the products being modeled.

===Algorithmic trading quantitative analyst===
Often the highest paid form of Quant, ATQs make use of methods taken from [[signal processing]], [[game theory]], gambling [[Kelly criterion]], [[market microstructure]], [[econometrics]], and [[time series]] analysis. [[Algorithmic trading]] includes [[statistical arbitrage]], but includes techniques largely based upon speed of response, to the extent that some ATQs modify hardware and Linux kernels to achieve ultra low [[Latency (engineering)|latency]].

===Risk management===
This has grown in importance in recent years, as the credit crisis exposed holes in the mechanisms used to ensure that positions were correctly hedged, though in no bank does the pay in risk approach that in front office. A core technique is [[value at risk]], and this is backed up with various forms of [[stress test (financial)]], [[economic capital]] analysis and direct analysis of the positions and models used by various bank's divisions.

===Innovation===
In the aftermath of the financial crisis, there surfaced the recognition that quantitative valuation methods were generally too narrow in their approach. An agreed upon fix adopted by numerous financial institutions has been to improve collaboration.

===Model validation===
Model validation (MV) takes the models and methods developed by front office, library, and modeling quantitative analysts and determines their validity and correctness. The MV group might well be seen as a superset of the quantitative operations in a financial institution, since it must deal with new and advanced models and trading techniques from across the firm. Before the crisis however, the pay structure in all firms was such that MV groups struggle to attract and retain adequate staff, often with talented quantitative analysts leaving at the first opportunity. This gravely impacted corporate ability to manage model risk, or to ensure that the positions being held were correctly valued. An MV quantitative analyst would typically earn a fraction of quantitative analysts in other groups with similar length of experience. In the years following the crisis, this has changed. Regulators now typically talk directly to the quants in the middle office such as the model validators, and since profits highly depend of the regulatory infrastructure, model validation has gained in weight and importance with respect to the quants in the front office.

===Quantitative developer===
Quantitative developers are computer specialists that assist, implement and maintain the quantitative models. They tend to be highly specialised language technicians that bridge the gap between software developer and quantitative analysts.

==Mathematical and statistical approaches==
Because of their backgrounds, quantitative analysts draw from various forms of mathematics: [[statistics]] and [[probability]], [[calculus]] centered around [[partial differential equation]]s, [[linear algebra]], [[discrete mathematics]], and [[econometrics]]. Some on the buy side may use [[machine learning]]. The
majority of quantitative analysts have received little formal education in mainstream economics, and often apply a mindset drawn from the physical sciences. Quants use mathematical skills learned from diverse fields such as computer science, physics and engineering. These skills include (but are not limited to) advanced statistics,  linear algebra and partial differential equations as well as solutions to these based upon [[numerical analysis]].

Commonly used numerical methods are:
* [[Finite difference method]] &amp;ndash; used to solve [[partial differential equation]]s;
* [[Monte Carlo method]] &amp;ndash; Also used to solve [[partial differential equation]]s, but [[Monte Carlo simulation]] is also common in risk management;
* [[Ordinary least squares]] &amp;ndash; used to estimate parameters in [[regression analysis|statistical regression analysis]];
* [[Spline interpolation]] &amp;ndash; used to interpolate values from [[yield curve|spot and forward interest rates curves]], and [[volatility smile]]s;
* [[Bisection method|Bisection]], [[Newton method|Newton]], and [[Secant method]]s &amp;ndash; used to find the [[root of a function|roots]], [[maxima and minima]] of functions (e.g. [[internal rate of return]].)

==Techniques==
A typical problem for a mathematically oriented quantitative analyst would be to develop a model for pricing, hedging, and risk-managing a complex derivative product. These quantitative analysts tend to rely more on numerical analysis than statistics and econometrics. The mindset is to prefer a deterministically "correct" answer, as once there is agreement on input values and market variable dynamics, there is only [[law of one price|one correct price]] for any given security (which can be demonstrated, albeit often inefficiently, through a large volume of Monte Carlo simulations).

A typical problem for a statistically oriented quantitative analyst would be to develop a model for deciding which stocks are relatively expensive and which stocks are relatively cheap. The model might include a company's book value to price ratio, its trailing earnings to price ratio, and other accounting factors. An investment manager might implement this analysis by buying the underpriced stocks, selling the overpriced stocks, or both. Statistically oriented quantitative analysts tend to have more of a reliance on statistics and econometrics, and less of a reliance on sophisticated numerical techniques and object-oriented programming. These quantitative analysts tend to be of the psychology that enjoys trying to find the best approach to modeling data, and can accept that there is no "right answer" until time has passed and we can retrospectively see how the model performed. Both types of quantitative analysts demand a strong knowledge of sophisticated mathematics and computer programming proficiency.

One of the principal mathematical tools of quantitative finance is [[stochastic calculus]].

'''Quasi-empirical methods''' are [[methodology|methods]] applied in [[science]] and [[mathematics]] to achieve [[epistemology]] similar to that of [[empiricism]] (thus ''[[wikt:quasi-#Prefix|quasi-]] + empirical'') when [[experience]] cannot [[falsifiability|falsify]] the ideas involved. [[Empirical research]] relies on [[empirical evidence]], and its empirical methods involve [[experiment]]ation and disclosure of apparatus for [[reproducibility]], by which scientific findings are [[verification and validation|validated]] by other scientists. Empirical methods are studied extensively in the [[philosophy of science]], but they cannot be used directly in fields whose hypotheses cannot be falsified by real experiment (for example, [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], [[theology]], and [[ideology]]). Because of such [[empirical limits in science]], the [[scientific method]] must rely not only on empirical methods but sometimes also on quasi-empirical ones. The prefix ''[[wikt:quasi-#Prefix|quasi-]]'' came to denote methods that are "almost" or "socially approximate" an ideal of truly empirical methods.

It is unnecessary to find all counterexamples to a theory; all that is required to disprove a theory logically is one counterexample. The converse does not prove a theory; [[Bayesian inference]] simply makes a theory more likely, by weight of evidence.

One can argue that no science is capable of finding all counter-examples to a theory, therefore, no science is strictly empirical, it's all quasi-empirical. But usually, the term "quasi-empirical" refers to the means of choosing problems to focus on (or ignore), selecting prior work on which to build an argument or proof, notations for informal claims, peer review and acceptance, and incentives to discover, ignore, or correct errors.  These are common to both [[science]] and [[mathematics]], and do not include experimental method.

[[Albert Einstein]]'s discovery of the [[general relativity]] theory relied upon [[thought experiments]] and [[mathematics]]. Empirical methods only became relevant when confirmation was sought. Furthermore, some empirical confirmation was found only some time after the general acceptance of the theory.

Thought experiments are almost standard procedure in [[philosophy]], where a conjecture is tested out in the imagination for possible effects on experience; when these are thought to be implausible,  unlikely to occur, or not actually occurring, then the conjecture may be either rejected or amended.  [[Logical positivism]] was a perhaps extreme version of this practice, though this claim is open to debate.

Post-20th-century [[philosophy of mathematics]] is mostly concerned with [[quasi-empiricism in mathematics|quasi-empirical mathematical methods]], especially as reflected in the actual [[mathematical practice]] of working mathematicians.

{{seealso|Universal approximation theorem}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''representation theorem''' is a theorem that states that every abstract structure with certain properties is [[isomorphic]] to another (abstract or concrete) structure. 

For example, 
*in algebra, 
** [[Cayley's theorem]] states that every [[group (mathematics)|group]] is isomorphic to a group of permutations.
**:[[Representation theory]]  studies properties of abstract groups via their representations as linear transformations of vector spaces. 
** [[Stone's representation theorem]] for [[Boolean algebra]]s states that every [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] is isomorphic to a field of sets. 
**: A variant, Stone's representation theorem for  lattices states that every [[distributive lattice]] is isomorphic to a sublattice of the [[power set]] lattice of some set.
**: Another variant states that there exists a duality (in the sense of an arrow reversing equivalence) between the categories of [[Boolean algebra]]s and that of [[Stone space]]s.
** The [[Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem]] states that every [[Lie algebra]] embeds into the commutator Lie algebra of its [[universal enveloping algebra]]. 
** [[Ado's theorem]] states that every finite-dimensional [[Lie algebra]] over a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] of [[characteristic zero]] embeds into the Lie algebra of endomorphisms of some finite-dimensional vector space.
** [[Birkhoff's HSP theorem]] states that every [[model (model theory)|model]] of an algebra ''A'' is the homomorphic image of a [[subalgebra]] of a [[direct product]] of copies of ''A''.
*in category theory, 
** The [[Yoneda lemma]] provides a full and faithful limit-preserving embedding of any category into a category of [[presheaves]].
** [[Mitchell's embedding theorem]] for abelian categories realises every small abelian category as a full (and exactly embedded) subcategory of a category of modules over some ring.
**[[Mostowski collapse lemma|Mostowski's collapsing theorem]] states that every well-founded extensional structure is isomorphic to a transitive set with the ∈-relation.
** One of the fundamental theorems in [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] theory states that every sheaf over a [[topological space]] can be thought of as a sheaf of [[section (fiber bundle)|section]]s of some (étalé) bundle over that space: the categories of sheaves on a topological space and that of [[étalé space]]s over it are equivalent, where the equivalence is given by the functor that sends a bundle to its sheaf of (local) sections.
*in functional analysis
** The [[Gelfand–Naimark–Segal construction]] embeds any [[C*-algebra]] in an algebra of [[bounded operators]] on some [[Hilbert space]].
** The [[Gelfand representation]] (also known as the commutative Gelfand-Naimark theorem) states that any commutative [[C*-algebra]] is isomorphic to an algebra of continuous functions on its [[Gelfand spectrum]]. It can also be seen as the construction as a duality between the category of commutative [[C*-algebras]] and that of [[compact Hausdorff space]]s.
** The [[Riesz representation theorem]] is actually a list of several theorems; one of them identifies the dual space of ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') with the set of regular measures on ''X''.
*in geometry
** The [[Whitney embedding theorem]]s embed any abstract [[manifold]] in some [[Euclidean space]].
** The [[Nash embedding theorem]] embeds an abstract [[Riemannian manifold]] isometrically in a [[Euclidean space]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1713">In mathematics, more precisely, in the theory of [[simplicial set]]s, a '''simplicial group''' is a [[simplicial object]] in the [[category of groups]]. Similarly, a '''simplicial abelian group''' is a simplicial object in the [[category of abelian groups]]. A simplicial group is a [[Kan complex]] (in particular, its homotopy groups make sense.) The [[Dold–Kan correspondence]] says that a simplicial abelian group may be identified with a chain complex.&lt;!-- need more precision --&gt;

A commutative monoid in the category of simplicial abelian groups is a [[simplicial commutative ring]].

{{harvtxt|Eckmann|1945}} discusses a simplicial analogue of the fact that a cohomology class on a [[Kähler manifold]] has a unique [[harmonic function|harmonic representative]] and deduces [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]] from these observations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16631">The '''space mapping''' methodology for modeling and design optimization of [[engineering systems]] was first discovered by [[John Bandler]] in 1993. It uses relevant existing knowledge to speed up model generation and design [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]] of a system. The knowledge is updated with new validation information from the system when available.

==Concept==
The space mapping methodology employs a "quasi-global" formulation that intelligently links companion "coarse" (ideal or low-fidelity) and "fine" (practical or high-fidelity) models of different complexities. In engineering design, space mapping aligns a very fast coarse model with the expensive-to-compute fine model so as to avoid direct expensive optimization of the fine model. The alignment can be done either off-line (model enhancement) or on-the-fly with surrogate updates (e.g., aggressive space mapping).
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Space Mapping Concept.png|thumb|left|400px|The space mapping concept as it has evolved over the years (Bandler et. al 1994-)&lt;ref name = "feel"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;

==Methodology==
At the core of the process is a pair of models: one very accurate but too expensive to use directly with a conventional optimization routine, and one significantly less expensive and, accordingly, less accurate. The latter (fast model) is usually referred to as the "coarse" model ([[Coarse space (numerical analysis)|coarse space]]). The former (slow model) is usually referred to as the "fine" model. A validation space ("reality") represents the fine model, for example, a high-fidelity physics model. The optimization space, where conventional optimization is carried out, incorporates the coarse model (or [[surrogate model]]), for example, the low-fidelity physics or "knowledge" model. In a space-mapping design optimization phase, there is a prediction or "execution" step, where the results of an optimized "mapped coarse model" (updated surrogate) are assigned to the fine model for validation. After the validation process, if the design specifications are not satisfied, relevant data is transferred to the optimization space ("[[feedback]]"), where the mapping-augmented coarse model or surrogate is updated (enhanced, realigned with the fine model) through an iterative optimization process termed "parameter extraction". The mapping formulation itself incorporates "intuition", part of the engineer's so-called "feel" for a problem.&lt;ref name = "feel" /&gt; In particular, the Aggressive Space Mapping (ASM) process displays key characteristics of cognition (an expert's approach to a problem), and is often illustrated in simple cognitive terms.

[[File:LindnerAttractor.webm|thumb|Delay Coordinate Embedding Attractor Reconstruction of the strange nonchaotic dynamics of the pulsating star KIC 5520878]]

In mathematics, a '''strange nonchaotic attractor''' ('''SNA''') is a form of [[attractor]] which, while converging to a limit, is [[strange attractor|strange]], because it is not [[piecewise differentiable]], and also non-[[chaos theory|chaotic]], in that its [[Lyapunov exponents]] are non-positive.&lt;ref name=alseda&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mat.uab.cat/~alseda/talks/SNA_Defin20070308.pdf|title=On the definition of Strange Nonchaotic Attractor|author=Lluís Alsedà|date=March 8, 2007|accessdate=2014-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; SNAs were introduced as a topic of study by Grebogi et al. in 1984.&lt;ref name=alseda/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Grebogi, E. Ott, S. Pelikan, and J. A. Yorke. Strange attractors that are not chaotic. Phys. D, 13(1-2):261–268, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; SNAs can be distinguished from [[periodic attractor|periodic]], [[quasiperiodic]] and [[chaotic attractor]]s using the [[0-1 test for chaos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=1303.0169|last1= Gopal|first1= R.|title= Applicability of 0-1 Test for Strange Nonchaotic Attractors|last2=  Venkatesan|first2= A.|last3=  Lakshmanan|first3= M.|year= 2013|doi=10.1063/1.4808254|pmid= 23822488|volume=23|issue= 2|journal=Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science|page=023123|bibcode=2013Chaos..23b3123G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Periodically driven damped nonlinear systems can exhibit complex dynamics characterized by strange chaotic attractors, where strange refers  to  the  fractal  geometry of the attractor and chaotic refers to the exponential sensitivity of orbits on the attractor. Quasiperiodically driven systems forced by incommensurate frequencies are natural extensions of periodically driven ones and are phenomenologically richer. In addition to periodic or quasiperiodic motion, they can exhibit chaotic or nonchaotic motion on strange  attractors. Although quasiperiodic forcing is not necessary for strange nonchaotic  dynamics (e.g., the period doubling accumulation point of a period doubling cascade), if quasiperiodic driving is not present, strange nonchaotic attractors are typically not robust and not expected to occur naturally because they exist only when the system is carefully tuned to a precise critical parameter value.  On the other hand, it was shown in the paper of Grebogi et al. that SNA's can be robust when the system is quasiperiodically driven. The  first  experiment  to  demonstrate a robust strange nonchaotic attractor involved  the  buckling of a magnetoelastic ribbon driven quasiperiodically by two incommensurate frequencies in the golden ratio.&lt;ref&gt;Ditto, W. L. and Spano, M. L. and Savage, H. T. and Rauseo, S. N. and Heagy, J. and Ott, E, Experimental observation of a strange non chaotic attractor, Phys. Rev. Lett. 65 (5), (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; Strange nonchaotic attractors have been robustly observed in laboratory experiments involving magnetoelastic ribbons, electrochemical cells, electronic circuits, a neon glow discharge and most recently detected in the dynamics of the pulsating [[RR Lyrae variables]] KIC 5520878 (as obtained from the [[Kepler Space Telescope]]) which may be the first strange nonchaotic [[dynamical system]] observed in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;Lindner, John F. and Kohar, Vivek and Kia, Behnam and Hippke, Michael and Learned, John G. and Ditto, William L., Strange Nonchaotic Stars, Phys.

'''''The Whetstone of Witte''''' is the shortened title of [[Robert Recorde]]'s [[mathematics]] book published in 1557, the full title being '''''The whetstone of witte, whiche is the seconde parte of Arithmetike: containyng thextraction of Rootes: The ''Coßike'' practise, with the rule of ''Equation'': and the woorkes of ''Surde Nombers'''. The book covers topics including whole numbers, the extraction of roots and irrational numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1007/978-0-85729-862-1_10|title=Robert Recorde: Tudor Polymath, Expositor and Practitioner of Computation|series=History of Computing|first=Jack|last=Williams|publisher=Springer|year=2011|isbn=9780857298621|contribution=The Whetstone of Witte|pages=173–196}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The work is notable for containing the first recorded use of the [[equals sign]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Galileo's Finger:The Ten Great Ideas of Science|first=Peter|last=Atkins|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=9780191622502|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kJyXzvkXWBAC&amp;pg=PT484|page=484}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and also for being the first book in English to use the [[plus and minus signs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A History of Mathematical Notations|first=Florian|last=Cajori|authorlink=Florian Cajori|publisher=Cosimo|year=2007|isbn=9781602066847|page=164|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rhEh8jPGQOcC&amp;pg=PA164}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prime factor exponent notation|Recordian notation]] for [[exponentiation]], however, differed from the later Cartesian notation &lt;math&gt;p^q = p \times p \times p \cdots \times p&lt;/math&gt;.  Recorde expressed [[exponent|indices]] and [[Nth root|surds]] larger than 3 in a systematic form based on the [[prime factorization]] of the exponent: a factor of two he termed a ''zenzic'', and a factor of three, a ''cubic''. Recorde termed the larger prime numbers appearing in this factorization ''sursolids'', distinguishing between them by use of ordinal numbers: that is, he defined 5 as the ''first sursolid'', written as '''ʃz''' and 7 as the ''second sursolid'', written as '''Bʃz'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Williams|2011}}, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;
He also devised symbols for these factors: a zenzic was denoted by '''z''', and a cubic by '''&amp;'''.  For instance, he referred to ''p&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;=p&lt;sup&gt;2×2×2&lt;/sup&gt;'' as '''zzz''' (the [[zenzizenzizenzic]]), and ''q&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;=q&lt;sup&gt;2×2×3&lt;/sup&gt;'' as '''zz&amp;''' (the zenzizenzicubic).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Williams|2011}}, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the book he includes a chart of exponents all the way up to ''p&lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt;=p&lt;sup&gt;2×2×2x2x5&lt;/sup&gt;'' written as '''zzzzʃz'''. There is an error in the chart, however, writing ''p&lt;sup&gt;69&lt;/sup&gt;'' as '''Sʃz''', despite it not being a prime. It should be ''p&lt;sup&gt;3x23&lt;/sup&gt;'' or '''&amp;Gʃz'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Williams|2011}}, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[scientific modeling|modeling]] of [[physics]], a '''toy model''' is a deliberately simplistic model with many details removed so that it can be used to explain a mechanism concisely. It is also useful in a description of the fuller model. 

* '''In "toy" mathematical models''',{{clarify|is this in mathematics in general, or mathematical physics?|date=December 2016}} this is usually done by reducing or extending the number of dimensions or reducing the number of fields/variables or restricting them to a particular symmetric form. 
* '''In "toy" physical descriptions''', an analogous example of an everyday mechanism is often used for illustration.

The phrase '''"tinker-toy model"''' is also used,{{fact|date=December 2016}} in reference to the popular [[Tinkertoy]]s used for children's [[constructivist learning]].

==Examples==
Examples of toy models in physics include:

* the [[Ising model]]{{clarify|what makes this a "toy"|date=December 2016}} as a toy model for [[ferromagnetism]], or [[lattice model (physics)|lattice models]] more generally;
* [[orbital mechanics]] as described by assuming that Earth is attached to the Sun by an elastic band;
* [[Hawking radiation]] around a [[black hole]] described as conventional radiation from a fictitious membrane at radius [[r=2M]] (the black hole [[membrane paradigm]]);
* [[frame-dragging]] around a rotating star considered as the effect of space being a conventional viscous fluid.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1065">{{unreferenced|date=October 2017}}In [[mathematics]], a '''toy theorem''' is a simplified version ([[special case]]) of a more general [[theorem]]. For instance, by introducing some simplifying assumptions in a theorem, one obtains a toy theorem.

Usually, a toy theorem is used to illustrate the claim of a theorem. It can also be insightful to study proofs of a toy theorem derived from a non-trivial theorem. Toy theorems can also have education value. After presenting a theorem (with, say, a highly non-trivial proof), one can sometimes give some assurance that the theorem really holds, by proving a toy version of the theorem.

For instance, a toy theorem of the [[Brouwer fixed-point theorem]] is obtained by restricting the [[dimension]] to one. In this case, the Brouwer fixed-point theorem follows almost immediately from the [[intermediate value theorem]].

In [[mathematics]], an expression is called '''well-defined''' or ''unambiguous'' if its definition assigns it a unique interpretation or value. Otherwise, the expression is said to be ''not well-defined'' or ''ambiguous''.&lt;ref name="MathWorld"&gt;{{cite web | last = Weisstein | first = Eric W. | title = Well-Defined | publisher = From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource | url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Well-Defined.html | accessdate = 2 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A function is well-defined if it gives the same result when the representation of the input is changed without changing the value of the input. For instance if ''f'' takes real numbers as input, and if ''f''(0.5) does not equal ''f''(1/2) then ''f'' is not well-defined (and thus: not a function).&lt;ref&gt;Joseph J. Rotman, ''The Theory of Groups: an Introduction'', p.&amp;nbsp;287 "... a function is "single-valued," or, as we prefer to say ... a function is ''well defined''.", Allyn and Bacon, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''well-defined'' is also used to indicate whether a logical statement is unambiguous.

A function that is not well-defined is not the same as a function that is [[undefined (mathematics)|undefined]]. For example, if ''f''(''x'') = 1/''x'', then ''f''(0) is undefined, but this has nothing to do with the question of whether ''f''(''x'') = 1/''x'' is well-defined.  It is; 0 is simply not in the domain of the function.

==Example==
Let &lt;math&gt;A_0,A_1&lt;/math&gt; be sets, let &lt;math&gt;A = A_0 \cup A_1&lt;/math&gt; and "define" &lt;math&gt;f: A \rightarrow \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;f(a)=0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;a \in A_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(a)=1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;a \in A_1&lt;/math&gt;.

Then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is well-defined if &lt;math&gt;A_0 \cap A_1 = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;. This is e.&amp;nbsp;g. the case when &lt;math&gt;A_0:=\{2,4\}, A_1:=\{3,5\}&lt;/math&gt; (then ''f''(''a'') happens to be [[Modulo operation|&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{mod}(a,2)&lt;/math&gt;]]).

If however &lt;math&gt;A_0 \cap A_1 \neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is not well-defined because &lt;math&gt;f(a)&lt;/math&gt; is "ambiguous" for &lt;math&gt;a \in A_0 \cap A_1&lt;/math&gt;. This is e.&amp;nbsp;g. the case when &lt;math&gt;A_0:=\{2\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A_1:=\{2\}&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, &lt;math&gt;A_0 \cap A_1=\{2\}\ni 2&lt;/math&gt; and ''f''(2) would have to be 0 as well as 1, which is impossible. Therefore, the latter ''f'' is not well-defined and thus not a function.

=="Definition" as anticipation of definition==
In order to avoid the apostrophes around "define" in the previous simple example, the "definition" of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; could be broken down into two simple logical steps:
{{ordered list
| ''The definition'' of the &lt;ins&gt;[[binary relation]]&lt;/ins&gt;: In the example
:&lt;math&gt;f := \bigl\{(a,i) \mid i \in \{0,1\} \wedge a \in A_i \bigr\} &lt;/math&gt;,
(which so far is nothing but a certain subset of the [[Cartesian product]] &lt;math&gt;A \times \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;.)
| ''The assertion'': The binary relation &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;ins&gt;function&lt;/ins&gt;; in the example
:&lt;math&gt;f: A \rightarrow \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;.
}}
Whereas the definition in step 1. is formulated with the freedom of any definition and is certainly effective (without the need to classify it as „well-defined“), the assertion in step 2. has to be proved: If and only if &lt;math&gt;A_0 \cap A_1 = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;, we get a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, and the &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; of "definition" is well-defined (as a function).

On the other hand: if &lt;math&gt;A_0 \cap A_1 \neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; then for an &lt;math&gt;a \in A_0 \cap A_1&lt;/math&gt; there is both, &lt;math&gt;(a,0) \in f&lt;/math&gt; ''and'' &lt;math&gt;(a,1) \in f&lt;/math&gt;, and the binary relation &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is not ''functional'' as defined in [[Binary relation#Special types of binary relations]] and thus not well-defined (as a function). Colloquially, the "function" &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is called ambiguous at point &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; (although there is ''per definitionem'' never an "ambiguous function"), and the original "definition" is pointless.

Despite these subtle logical problems, it is quite common to anticipatorily use the term definition (without apostrophes) for "definitions" of this kind, firstly because it is sort of a short-hand of the two-step approach, secondly because the relevant mathematical reasoning (step 2.) is the same in both cases, and finally because in mathematical texts the assertion is «up to 100%» true.

==Independence of representative==
The question of well-definedness of a function classically arises when the defining equation of a function does not (only) refer to the arguments themselves, but (also) to elements of the arguments. This is sometimes unavoidable when the arguments are [[coset]]s and the equation refers to coset representatives.

===Functions with one argument===
For example, consider the following function
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
f : &amp; \Z/8\Z         &amp; \to     &amp; \Z/4\Z\\
    &amp; \overline{n}_8 &amp; \mapsto &amp; \overline{n}_4,
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;n\in\Z, m\in \{4,8\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Z/m\Z&lt;/math&gt; are the [[modulo arithmetic|integers modulo ''m'']] and &lt;math&gt;\overline{n}_m&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[modulo arithmetic#Congruence classes|congruence class]] of ''n'' mod ''m''.

N.B.: &lt;math&gt;\overline{n}_4&lt;/math&gt; is a reference to the element &lt;math&gt;n \in \overline{n}_8&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\overline{n}_8&lt;/math&gt; is the argument of ''f''.

The function ''f'' is well-defined, because
:&lt;math&gt;n \equiv n' \operatorname{mod} 8 \; \Leftrightarrow \; 8\mid(n-n')  \; \Leftrightarrow \; 2\cdot 4\mid(n-n') \; \Rightarrow \; 4\mid(n-n') \; \Leftrightarrow \; n \equiv n' \operatorname{mod} 4.&lt;/math&gt;

===Operations===
In particular, the term well-defined is used with respect to (binary) [[operation (mathematics)|operation]]s on cosets. In this case one can view the operation as a function of two variables and the property of being well-defined is the same as that for a function. For example, addition on the integers modulo some ''n'' can be defined naturally in terms of integer addition. 
:&lt;math&gt;[a]\oplus[b] = [a+b]&lt;/math&gt;
The fact that this is well-defined follows from the fact that we can write any representative of &lt;math&gt;[a]&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;a+kn&lt;/math&gt;, where k is an integer. Therefore, 
:&lt;math&gt;[a+kn]\oplus[b] = [(a+kn)+b] = [(a+b)+kn] = [a+b] = [a]\oplus [b];&lt;/math&gt;
and similarly for any representative of &lt;math&gt;[b]&lt;/math&gt;.

==Well-defined notation==
For real numbers, the product &lt;math&gt;a \times b \times c&lt;/math&gt; is unambiguous because &lt;math&gt;(a \times b)\times c = a \times (b \times c)&lt;/math&gt;. (Therefore, the notation is said to be ''well-defined''.&lt;ref name="MathWorld"/&gt;) Because of this property of the [[operation (mathematics)|operation]] (here &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt;), which is known as [[associativity]], the result does not depend on the sequence of multiplications, so that a specification of the sequence can be omitted.

The [[subtraction]] operation, &lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt;, is not associative. However, there is a convention (or definition) in that the &lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt; operation is understood as addition of the opposite, thus &lt;math&gt;a-b-c&lt;/math&gt; is the same as &lt;math&gt;a + (-b) + (-c)&lt;/math&gt;, and is called "well-defined".

[[Division (mathematics)|Division]] is also non-associative. However, in the case of &lt;math&gt;a/b/c&lt;/math&gt; the convention &lt;math&gt;/b := *b^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is not so well established, so this expression is considered '''ill-defined'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.

Unlike with functions, the notational ambiguities can be overcome more or less easily by means of additional definitions, i.&amp;nbsp;e. rules of [[Operator precedence|precedence]], and/or associativity of the operators. In the programming language [[C (programming language)|C]] e.&amp;nbsp;g. the operator &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; for subtraction is ''left-to-right-associative'' which means that &lt;code&gt;a-b-c&lt;/code&gt; is defined as &lt;code&gt;(a-b)-c&lt;/code&gt; and the operator &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; for assignment is ''right-to-left-associative'' which means that &lt;code&gt;a=b=c&lt;/code&gt; is defined as &lt;code&gt;a=(b=c)&lt;/code&gt;. In the programming language [[APL (programming language)|APL]] there is only one rule: from [[APL (programming language)#Design|right to left]] − but parentheses first.

==Other uses of the term==
A solution to a [[partial differential equation]] is said to be well-defined if it is determined by the boundary conditions in a continuous way as the boundary conditions are changed.&lt;ref name="MathWorld" /&gt;
