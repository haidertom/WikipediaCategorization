[[File:Schriftprobe Latein 15 Jh.jpg|thumb|Example of [[Latin]] text with abbreviations]]

An '''abbreviation''' (from [[Latin]] ''brevis'', meaning ''short'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=brevis/breve, brevis M – Latin is Simple Online Dictionary|url=https://www.latin-is-simple.com/en/vocabulary/adjective/91/|website=www.latin-is-simple.com|accessdate=29 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a shortened form of a word or phrase.  It consists of a group of letters taken from the word or phrase. For example, the word ''abbreviation'' can itself be represented by the abbreviation ''abbr.'', ''abbrv.'', or ''abbrev.''

In strict analysis, abbreviations should not be confused with [[Contraction (grammar)|contractions]], [[crasis]], [[acronym]]s, or [[initialism]]s, with which they share some [[semantic]] and [[phonetic]] functions, though all four are connected by the term "abbreviation" in loose parlance.&lt;ref name=harts&gt;{{cite book|title=New Hart's Rules: The handbook of style for writers and editors|publisher=Oxford University Press, 2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3uwGtj8i_vkC&amp;dq=New+Hart%27s+Rules&amp;q=acronyms+contractions+10.1#v=snippet&amp;q=acronyms%20contractions%2010.1&amp;f=false|isbn=0-19-861041-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p167}}An abbreviation is a shortening by any method; a contraction is a reduction of size by the drawing together of the parts. A contraction of a word is made by omitting certain letters or [[syllable]]s and bringing together the first and last letters or elements; an abbreviation may be made by omitting certain portions from the interior or by cutting off a part. A contraction is an abbreviation, but an abbreviation is not necessarily a contraction. Acronyms and initialisms are regarded as subsets of abbreviations (e.g. by the [[Council of Science Editors]]). They are abbreviations that consist of the initial letters or parts of words.

== History ==
{{See also|Scribal abbreviation}}

Abbreviations have a long history, created so that spelling out a whole word could be avoided. This might be done to save time and space, and also to provide secrecy. Shortened words were used and initial letters were commonly used to represent words in specific applications. In classical [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], the reduction of words to single letters was common.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HA9kAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=abbreviations+history&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=D2NaVIitA6vbsASp94DgAg&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=abbreviations%20history&amp;f=false ''The British Cyclopaedia of the Arts, Sciences, History, Geography, Literature, Natural History, and Biography'', Wm. S. Orr and Company, 1838, p.5.]&lt;/ref&gt; In Roman inscriptions, "Words were commonly abbreviated by using the initial letter or letters of words, and most inscriptions have at least one abbreviation." However, "some could have more than one meaning, depending on their context. (For example, ''A'' can be an abbreviation for many words, such as ''ager'', ''amicus'', ''annus'', ''as'', ''Aulus'', ''Aurelius'', ''aurum'' and ''avus''.)"&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, L., [https://books.google.com/books?id=zGY1Sqjwf8kC&amp;dq=abbreviations++fashionable&amp;q=abbreviated+%22the+initial%22#v=snippet&amp;q=abbreviated%20%22the%20initial%22&amp;f=false ''Handbook to Life in Ancient Rome''], Infobase Publishing, 2004, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abbreviations in English were frequently used from its earliest days. Manuscripts of copies of the [[old English]] poem ''[[Beowulf]]'' used many abbreviations, for example ''7'' or ''&amp;'' for ''and'', and ''y'' for ''since'', so that "not much space is wasted".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=68EjAwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=abbreviations+history&amp;q=abbreviations+beowulf#v=snippet&amp;q=abbreviations%20beowulf&amp;f=false Gelderen, E. v, ''A History of the English Language: Revised edition'', John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2014, Ch. 4 1.]&lt;/ref&gt; The standardisation of English in the 15th through 17th centuries included such a growth in the use of abbreviations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spellingsociety.org/journals/j7/shortcuts.php Spelling Society : Shortcuts 1483–1660&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015214606/http://www.spellingsociety.org/journals/j7/shortcuts.php |date=October 15, 2007 }} Doesn't work.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} At first, abbreviations were sometimes represented with various suspension signs, not only periods. For example, sequences like ‹er› were replaced with ‹ɔ›, as in ‹mastɔ› for ''master'' and ‹exacɔbate› for ''exacerbate''. While this may seem trivial, it was symptomatic of an attempt by people manually reproducing academic texts to reduce the copy time. An example from the Oxford University Register, 1503:{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

{{quote|Mastɔ subwardenɔ y ɔmēde me to you. And wherɔ y wrot to you the last wyke that y trouyde itt good to differrɔ thelectionɔ ovɔ to quīdenaɔ tinitatis y have be thougħt me synɔ that itt woll be thenɔ a bowte mydsomɔ.}}

The [[Early Modern English]] period, between the 15th and 17th centuries, had abbreviations like ''y&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;'' for ''Þ&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;'', used for the word ''the'': "hence, by later misunderstanding, Ye Olde Tea Shoppe."&lt;ref&gt;Lass, R., ''The Cambridge History of the English Language'', Cambridge University Press, 2006, Vol. 2, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the growth of [[philology|philological]] linguistic theory in academic Britain, abbreviating became very fashionable. The use of abbreviation for the names of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and his friend [[C. S. Lewis]], and other members of the [[Oxford]] literary group known as the [[Inklings]], are sometimes cited as symptomatic of this.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Likewise, a century earlier in [[Boston]], a fad of abbreviation started that swept the United States, with the globally popular term [[Okay|OK]] generally credited as a remnant of its influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.illinoisprairie.info/chocokeh.htm |title=The Choctaw Expression 'Okeh' and the Americanism 'Okay' |publisher=Jim Fay |date=2007-09-13 |accessdate=2008-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224185657/http://www.illinoisprairie.info/chocokeh.htm |archivedate=2010-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_250.html |title=What does "OK" stand for? |work=[[The Straight Dope]] |accessdate=2008-05-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080512085453/http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_250.html| archivedate= 12 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, the British greatly reduced the use of the [[full stop]] and other punctuation points after abbreviations in at least semi-formal writing, while the Americans more readily kept such use until more recently, and still maintain it more than Britons{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}. The classic example, considered by their American counterparts quite curious, was the maintenance of the internal comma in a British organisation of secret agents called the "[[Special Operations, Executive]]"—"S.O., E"—which is not found in histories written after about 1960.

But before that, many Britons were more scrupulous at maintaining the French form. In French, the period only follows an abbreviation if the last letter in the abbreviation is ''not'' the last letter of its antecedent:  "M." is the abbreviation for "monsieur" while "Mme" is that for "madame". Like many other cross-[[English Channel|channel]] linguistic acquisitions, many Britons readily took this up and followed this rule themselves, while the Americans took a simpler rule and applied it rigorously.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Over the years, however, the lack of convention in some style guides has made it difficult to determine which two-word abbreviations should be abbreviated with periods and which should not. The U.S. media tend to use periods in two-word abbreviations like United States (U.S.), but not [[personal computer]] (PC) or television (TV). Many British publications have gradually done away with the use of periods in abbreviations.

Minimization of punctuation in typewritten material became economically desirable in the 1960s and 1970s for the many users of carbon-film [[IBM Selectric typewriter#Ribbons|ribbons]] since a period or comma consumed the same length of non-reusable expensive ribbon as did a capital letter.

Widespread use of electronic communication through mobile phones and the Internet during the 1990s allowed for a marked rise in colloquial abbreviation. This was due largely to increasing popularity of textual communication services such as instant- and text messaging. [[Short Message Service|SMS]], for instance, supports message lengths of 160 characters at most (using the [[GSM 03.38]] character set). This brevity gave rise to an informal abbreviation scheme sometimes called [[SMS language|Textese]], with which 10% or more of the words in a typical SMS message are abbreviated.&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, David. [[Txtng: the Gr8 Db8]]. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-19-954490-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently Twitter, a popular [[social networking service]], began driving abbreviation use with 140 character message limits.

== Style conventions in English ==

In modern English, there are several conventions for abbreviations, and the choice may be confusing. The only rule universally accepted is that one should be ''consistent'', and to make this easier, publishers express their preferences in a [[style guide]]. Questions which arise include those in the following subsections.

=== Lowercase letters ===

If the original word was capitalized then the first letter of its abbreviation should retain the capital, for example Lev. for ''Leviticus''. When a word is abbreviated to more than a single letter and was originally spelled with lower case letters then there is no need for capitalization. However, when abbreviating a phrase where only the first letter of each word is taken, then all letters should be capitalized, as in YTD for ''year-to-date'', PCB for ''printed circuit board'' and FYI for ''for your information''. However, see the following section regarding abbreviations that have become common vocabulary: these are no longer written with capital letters.

=== Periods (full stops) and spaces ===
[[File:“To Penna. R.R. Station”.jpg|thumb|Sign in New York City subway, reading “Penna.” for Penn''sylvani''a, showing American style of including the period even for contractions.]]
A period (full stop) is often used to signify an abbreviation, but opinion is divided as to when and if this should happen.

According to [[Hart's Rules]], the traditional rule is that abbreviations (in the narrow sense that includes only words with the ending, and not the middle, dropped) terminate with a full stop, whereas contractions (in the sense of words missing a middle part) do not, but there are exceptions.&lt;ref name="harts"/&gt;{{rp|p167–170}} [[Fowler's Modern English Usage]] says full stops are used to mark both abbreviations and contractions, but recommends against this practice: advising them only for abbreviations and lower-case initialisms and not for upper-case initialisms and contractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pocket Fowler's Modern English Usage|edition=2nd|editor-first=Robert|editor-last=Allen|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2008|isbn=9780191727078|contribution=Full stop}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[American English]], the period is usually included regardless of whether or not it is a contraction, e.g. ''Dr.'' or ''Mrs.''. In some cases, periods are optional, as in either ''US'' or ''U.S.'' for  ''United States'', ''EU'' or ''E.U.'' for ''European Union'', and ''UN'' or ''U.N.'' for ''United Nations''. There are some house styles, however—American ones included—that remove the periods from almost all abbreviations. For example:
* The U.S. [[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]] advises that periods should not be used with abbreviations on road signs, except for cardinal directions as part of a destination name. (For example, ''"Northwest Blvd"'', ''"W. Jefferson"'', and ''"PED XING"'' all follow this recommendation.) 
* [[AMA Manual of Style|AMA style]], used in many [[medical journal]]s, uses no periods in abbreviations or acronyms, with almost no exceptions. Thus [[exempli gratia|eg]], [[id est|ie]], [[wikt:versus|vs]], [[et al.]], [[Doctor (title)|Dr]], [[Mr.|Mr]], [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], [[intensive care unit|ICU]], and hundreds of others contain no periods. The only exceptions are "[[Numéro sign|No.]]" (to avoid the appearance of "[[yes and no|No]]"); initials within persons' names (such as "George R. Smith"); and "St." within persons' names when the person prefers it (such as "Emily R. St. Clair") (but not in city names such as ''St Louis''  or ''St Paul''). (AMA style also forgoes italic on terms long since naturalized into English from [[Latin]], [[New Latin]], other languages, or [[international scientific vocabulary|ISV]]; thus, no italic for [[exempli gratia|eg]], [[id est|ie]], [[wikt:versus|vs]], [[et al.]], [[in vivo]], [[in vitro]], or [[in situ]].)

Acronyms that were originally capitalized (with or without periods) but have since entered the vocabulary as generic words are no longer written with capital letters nor with any periods. Examples are [[sonar]], [[radar]], [[lidar]], [[laser]], [[SNAFU|snafu]], and [[Scuba set|scuba]].

Today, spaces are generally not used between single-letter abbreviations of words in the same phrase, so one almost never encounters "U.&amp;nbsp;S."

When an abbreviation appears at the end of a sentence, only one period is used: ''The capital of the United States is Washington, D.C''.

=== Plural forms ===

There is a question about how to pluralize abbreviations, particularly acronyms. Often a writer will add an 's' following an apostrophe, as in "PC's". However, this style is not preferred by many style guides. For instance, Kate Turabian, writing about style in academic writings,&lt;ref name="Chicago"&gt;Turabian, K., ''A Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations'', 7th Edition, subsection 20.1.2&lt;/ref&gt; allows for an apostrophe to form plural acronyms "only when an abbreviation contains internal periods or both capital and lowercase letters". Turabian would therefore prefer "DVDs" and "URLs" and "Ph.D.'s", while the [[Modern Language Association]]&lt;ref name="MLA"&gt;Modern Language Association (MLA) Handbook for Writers of Research Papers, 7th Edition 2009, subsection 3.2.7.g&lt;/ref&gt; explicitly says, "do not use an apostrophe to form the plural of an abbreviation".  Also, the [[American Psychological Association]] specifically says,&lt;ref name="APA"&gt;Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA), 5th Edition 2001, subsection 3.28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;''Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association'', 6th Edition 2010, subsection 4.29&lt;/ref&gt; "without an apostrophe".

However, the 1999 style guide for ''[[The New York Times]]'' states that the addition of an apostrophe is necessary when pluralizing all abbreviations, preferring "PC's, TV's and VCR's".&lt;ref&gt;Siegal, AM., Connolly, WG., [https://books.google.com/books?ei=-y5aVHCTyLAEl5GB0AE&amp;id=RT5w0s7_op8C&amp;dq=new+york+times+style&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=plurals+abbreviations ''The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage''], Three Rivers Press, 1999, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following those who would generally omit the apostrophe, to form the plural of [[run batted in]], simply add an s to the end of RBI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garner|first=Bryan|title=Garner's Modern American Usage|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford; New York|isbn=978-0-19-538275-4|page=638}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*RBIs

For all other rules, see below:

To form the plural of an abbreviation, a number, or a capital letter used as a noun, simply add a lowercase ''s'' to the end. Apostrophes following decades and single letters are also common.
* A group of MPs
* The roaring 20s
* Mind your Ps and Qs

To indicate the plural of the abbreviation or symbol of a unit of measure, the same form is used as in the singular.
* 1&amp;nbsp;lb or 20&amp;nbsp;lb
* 1&amp;nbsp;ft or 16&amp;nbsp;ft
* 1 min or 45 min

When an abbreviation contains more than one full point, ''Hart's Rules'' recommends putting the ''s'' after the final one.
* Ph.D.s
* M.Phil.s
* the d.t.s
However, subject to any house style or consistency requirement, the same plurals may be rendered less formally as:
* PhDs
* MPhils
* the DTs. (This is the recommended form in the ''New Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors''.)

According to ''Hart's Rules'', an apostrophe may be used in rare cases where clarity calls for it, for example when letters or symbols are referred to as objects.
* The x's of the equation
* Dot the i's and cross the t's
However, the apostrophe can be dispensed with if the items are set in italics or quotes:
* The ''x''s of the equation
* Dot the 'i's and cross the 't's

In Latin, and continuing to the derivative forms in European languages as well as English, single-letter abbreviations had the plural being a doubling of the letter for note-taking. Most of these deal with writing and publishing. A few longer abbreviations use this as well.

=== Conventions followed by publications and newspapers ===

==== United States ====

Publications based in the U.S. tend to follow the style guides of ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'' and the [[Associated Press]].{{Verify source|date=May 2008}} The U.S. Government follows a style guide published by the [[U.S. Government Printing Office]].  The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] sets the style for abbreviations of units.

==== United Kingdom ====

Many British publications follow some of these guidelines in abbreviation:
* For the sake of convenience, many British publications, including the [[BBC]] and ''[[The Guardian]]'', have completely done away with the use of full stops or periods in all abbreviations. These include:
** Social titles, e.g. Ms or Mr (though these would usually have not had full stops—see above) Capt, Prof, ''etc.;''
** Two-letter abbreviations for countries (''"US"'', not ''"U.S."'');
** Abbreviations beyond three letters (full caps for all except initialisms{{clarify|date=November 2015}});
** Words seldom abbreviated with lower case letters (''"PR"'', instead of ''"p.r."'', or ''"pr"'')
** Names (''"FW de Klerk"'', ''"GB Whiteley"'', ''"Park JS"'').  A notable exception is ''[[The Economist]]'' which writes ''"Mr F. W. de Klerk"''.
** Scientific units (see Measurement below).
* Acronyms are often referred to with only the first letter of the abbreviation capitalized. For instance, the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] can be abbreviated as ''"Nato"'' or ''"NATO"'', and [[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome]] as ''"Sars"'' or ''"SARS"'' (compare with ''"[[laser]]"'' which has made the full transition to an English word and is rarely capitalised at all).
* Initialisms are always written in capitals; for example the ''"British Broadcasting Corporation"'' is abbreviated to ''"BBC"'', never ''"Bbc"''. An initialism is similar to acronym but is not pronounced as a word.
* When abbreviating scientific units, no space is added between the number and unit (&lt;nowiki&gt;100mph, 100m, 10cm, 10°C&lt;/nowiki&gt;). (This is contrary to the SI standard; see below.)

==== Miscellaneous and general rules ====

* A doubled letter appears in abbreviations of some Welsh names, as in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] the double "l" is a separate sound: "Ll. George" for (British prime minister) [[David Lloyd George]].
* Some titles, such as "Reverend" and "Honourable", are spelt out when preceded by "the", rather than as "Rev." or "Hon." respectively.  This is true for most British publications, and some in the United States.
* A repeatedly used abbreviation should be spelt out for identification on its first occurrence in a written or spoken passage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Blake]] and [[Robert W. Bly]], ''The Elements of Technical Writing'', pg. 53. New York City: Macmillan Publishers, 1993. {{ISBN|0020130856}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbreviations likely to be unfamiliar to many readers should be avoided.

== Measurement shorthand—symbol or abbreviation ==
[[File:PRC Expressway RoadSign Distances.jpg|thumb|200px|Road sign in China—"km" is a symbol, not an abbreviation, as it is not a contraction of a Chinese word]]

Writers often use shorthand to denote units of measure.  Such shorthand can be an abbreviation, such as "in" for "[[inch]]" or can be a symbol such as "km" for "[[kilometre]]/kilometer".

The shorthand "in" applies to English only—in [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] for example, the shorthand "dm" is used for the equivalent Afrikaans word "duim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title = Woordeboek/Dictionary; Afrikaans-English / Engels-Afrikaans
| editor = Abel Coetzee
| publisher = Collins
| year = 1969
| oclc = 29232187
| location = Glasgow and Johannesburg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since both "in" and "dm" are contractions of the same word, but in different languages, they are abbreviations. A symbol on the other hand, defined as "Mark or character taken as the conventional sign of some object or idea or process"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title = Oxford Concise Dictionary
|publisher = Oxford University Press
|year = 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; applies the appropriate shorthand by ''substitution'' rather than by ''contraction''. Since the shorthand for kilometre/kilometer (''[[:pt:Quilômetro|quilômetro]]'' in Portuguese or ''[[:el:Χιλιόμετρο|χιλιόμετρο]]'' in Greek) is "km" in both languages and the letter "k" does not appear in the expansion of either translation, "km" is a symbol as it is a substitution rather than a contraction. It is a [[logogram]] rather than an abbreviation.

In the [[International System of Units]] (SI) manual&lt;ref&gt;{{SIbrochure8th}}&lt;/ref&gt; the word "symbol" is used consistently to define the shorthand used to represent the various SI units of measure. The manual also [[International System of Units|defines the way in which units should be written]], the principal rules being:
*The conventions for upper and lower case letters must be observed—for example 1&amp;nbsp;MW (megawatts) is equal to 1,000,000,000&amp;nbsp;mW (milliwatts).
*No periods should be inserted between letters—for example "m.s" (which is an approximation of "m·s", which correctly uses [[middle dot]]) is the symbol for "metres multiplied by seconds", but "ms" is the symbol for milliseconds.
*No periods should follow the symbol unless the syntax of the sentence demands otherwise (for example a full stop at the end of a sentence).
*The singular and plural versions of the symbol are identical—not all languages use the letter "s" to denote a plural.

== Syllabic abbreviation ==
&lt;!--irony is this is linked from the MOS on how not to do it like this! - see [[MOS:CAPSACRS]]--&gt;
A syllabic abbreviation is usually formed from the initial syllables of several words, such as ''[[Interpol]]'' = '''''Inter'''national'' + '''''pol'''ice''. It is a variant of the acronym. Syllabic abbreviations are usually written using [[lower case]], sometimes starting with a [[capital letter]], and are always pronounced as words rather than letter by letter. Syllabic abbreviations should be distinguished from [[portmanteau]]s, which combine two words without necessarily taking whole syllables from each.

=== Usage ===

Syllabic abbreviations are not widely used in English. Some UK government ministries such as [[Ofcom]] ('''''Of'''fice of '''Com'''munications'') and [[Oftel]] ('''''Of'''fice of '''Tel'''ecommunications'') use this style.

New York City has various neighborhoods named by syllabic abbreviation, such as [[Tribeca]] ('''''Tri'''angle '''be'''low '''Ca'''nal Street'') and [[SoHo]] ('''''So'''uth of '''Ho'''uston Street''). This usage has spread into other American cities, giving [[South of Market, San Francisco|SoMa]], San Francisco ('''''So'''uth of '''Ma'''rket'') and [[LoDo, Denver]] ('''''Lo'''wer '''Do'''wntown''), among others.

==== Languages other than English====

On the other hand, syllabic abbreviations prevailed both in Germany under the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] and in the Soviet Union for naming the plethora of new bureaucratic organisations. For example, ''[[Gestapo]]'' stands for '''''Ge'''heime '''Sta'''ats-'''Po'''lizei'', or "secret state police". Similarly, Leninist organisations such as the ''[[Comintern]]'' (''Communist International'') and ''[[Komsomol]]'' ('''''Kom'''munisticheskii '''So'''yuz '''Mol'''odyozhi'', or "Communist youth union") used Russian language syllabic abbreviations. This has given syllabic abbreviations negative connotations in some countries,{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} (as in Orwell's [[Newspeak]]), notwithstanding that such abbreviations were used in Germany even before the Nazis came to power, e.g., ''[[:de:Schupo|Schupo]]'' for ''Schutzpolizei'', and are still used, e.g. ''[[:de:Kripo|Kripo]]'' for ''[[:de:Kriminalpolizei|Kriminalpolizei]]''.

In the modern Russian language words like ''Minoborony'' (from '''Min'''isterstvo '''oborony''' — Ministry of Defence) and ''Minobrnauki'' (from '''Min'''isterstvo '''obr'''azovaniya i '''nauki''' — Ministry of Education and Science) are still commonly used.

Syllabic abbreviations were also typical for the [[German language]] used in the [[German Democratic Republic]], e.g. ''[[Stasi]]'' for '''''Sta'''ats'''si'''cherheit'' ("state security", the secret police) or ''Vopo'' for ''Volkspolizist'' ("people's policeman"). Other uses are in company or product names such as [[Aldi]], from the name of the founder, Theo '''Al'''brecht, and the German word '''''Di'''skont'' (discount) or [[Haribo]], from the name of the founder and the headquarters of the company, '''Ha'''ns '''Ri'''egl '''Bo'''nn.

Syllabic abbreviations are ''de rigueur'' in Spanish; examples abound in organization names such as [[Pemex]] for '''''Pe'''tróleos '''Mex'''icanos'' ("Mexican Petroleums") or Fonafifo for '''''Fo'''ndo '''Na'''cional de '''Fi'''nancimiento '''Fo'''restal'' (National Forestry Financing Fund).

East Asian languages whose writing systems use [[Chinese characters]] form abbreviations similarly by using key Chinese characters from a term or phrase.  For example, in Japanese the term for the [[United Nations]], ''kokusai rengō'' (国際連合) is often abbreviated to ''kokuren'' (国連). (Such abbreviations are called [[:ja:略語|ryakugo]] (略語) in Japanese; see also [[Japanese abbreviated and contracted words]]). The syllabic abbreviation is frequently used for universities: for instance, ''Běidà'' (北大) for ''Běijīng Dàxué'' (北京大学, [[Peking University]]) and ''Tōdai'' (東大) for ''Tōkyō daigaku'' (東京大学, [[University of Tokyo]]).  The English phrase "[[:wikt:gung ho|Gung ho]]" originated as a Chinese abbreviation.

==== Organizations ====
{{See also|Neologism}}

Partially syllabic abbreviations are preferred by the US Navy, as it increases readability amidst the large number of initialisms that would otherwise have to fit into the same acronyms. Hence ''[[DESRON]] 6'' is used (in the full capital form) to mean "Destroyer Squadron 6", while ''[[COMNAVAIRLANT]]'' would be "Commander, Naval Air Force (in the) Atlantic."

'''Acronym Finder''' ('''AF''') is a free online searchable dictionary and database of [[abbreviation]]s ([[acronym]]s, [[initialism]]s, and others) and their meanings.

The entries are classified into categories such as ''[[Information technology|Information Technology]], Military/Government, Science, [[Slang]]/[[Pop culture|Pop Culture]]'' etc. It also contains a database of [[United States|US]] and [[Canada|Canadian]] postal codes. For abbreviations with multiple meanings they are listed by popularity with the most common one being listed first. {{As of | 2018}} it claims to have over a million "''human-edited''" and verified [[definition]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acronymfinder.com/about.asp|title=About AcronymFinder.com|website=www.acronymfinder.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Acronym Finder was registered and the database put online by Michael K. Molloy of Colorado in 1997 but he began compiling it in 1985 working as a computer systems officer for the [[United States Air Force|USAF]].&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116865656948675976|title=BTW, if you need Info About C4ISR, Read This ASAP|author=Barry Newman|date=January 13, 2007|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molloy first saw the need of an acronym list while integrating computers at the [[Randolph Air Force Base]] in [[Texas]] His first acronym list running up-to 30 pages. When he had retired and put AF online in 1997, his list already had 43,000 acronyms. It began mainly as a list of Military/Government abbreviations before expanding to other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/2012630.html|title=Website of the Week — Acronym Finder (MP3)|work=VOA|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molloy and his wife served as the editors of the website verifying user submissions for abbreviations and adding others they found to the database. Molloy has also provided opinions on abbreviations such as "''MSG''" which [[Madison Square Garden]] wanted as a domain name (''msg.com'') claiming trademark to the abbreviated letters. He stated that MSG also stood for more common things such as [[monosodium glutamate]] and message among others. The Garden in the end settled out of court and came to own [https://www.msg.com/ msg.com].

The website was maintained under Mountain Data Systems, LLC by Molloy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/11239556|title=Acronym finder [digital] : AF. in SearchWorks catalog|website=searchworks.stanford.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acronymfinder.com/about.asp|title=About AcronymFinder.com|last=|first=|date=|website=acronymfinder.com|language=en|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130628092508/http://www.acronymfinder.com/about.asp|archive-date=2013-06-28|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-04-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; before being sold off and eventually coming under the ownership of '''''Farlex, Inc.''''' publishers of [[TheFreeDictionary.com|Thefreedictionary.com]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farlex.acronym.finder|title=Acronym Finder - Apps on Google Play|website=play.google.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apple and Orange - they do not compare.jpg|right|thumb|An apple and an orange]]
[[File:Paul Cézanne 179.jpg|Right|thumb|''Apples and Oranges'', by [[Paul Cézanne]].]]

A comparison of '''apples and oranges''' occurs when two items or groups of items are compared that cannot be practically compared.

The [[idiom]], ''comparing apples and oranges'', refers to the apparent differences between items which are popularly thought to be incomparable or [[unit commensurability|incommensurable]], such as [[apple]]s and [[orange (fruit)|orange]]s. The idiom may also be used to indicate that a [[false analogy]] has been made between two items, such as where an ''apple'' is faulted for not being a good ''orange''.

==Variants==
{{multiple issues|
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
{{original research|section|date=August 2014}}}}
The idiom is not unique to English. In [[Quebec French]], it may take the form ''comparer des pommes avec des oranges'' (to compare apples and oranges), while in European French the idiom says ''comparer des pommes et des poires'' (to compare apples and pears). In [[Latin America]]n Spanish, it is usually ''comparar papas y boniatos'' (comparing potatoes and sweet potatoes) or commonly for all [[Spanish dialects and varieties|varieties of Spanish]] ''comparar peras con manzanas'' (comparing pears and apples). In some other languages the term for 'orange' derives from 'apple', suggesting not only that a direct comparison between the two is possible, but that it is implicitly present in their names. Fruit other than apples and oranges can also be compared; for example, apples and [[pear]]s are compared in [[Danish language|Danish]], Dutch, German, Spanish, [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], Italian, [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. In fact, in the Spanish-speaking world, a common idiom is ''sumar peras con manzanas'', that is, ''to add pears and apples''; the same thing applies in Italian (''sommare le mele con le pere'') and Romanian (''a aduna merele cu perele''). In Portuguese, the expression is ''comparar laranjas com bananas'' (compare orange to banana).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/esportes/osorio-sobre-o-pan-e-as-olimpiadas-estao-comparando-banana-com-laranja-bxxxe6v1cotxnsrh5vowm64pa Olimpíadas: "Estão comparando banana com laranja"], ''Gazeta do Povo'', 15 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In Czech, the idiom ''míchat jablka s hruškami'' literally means 'to mix apples and pears'.

[[Image:Apples.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Not all apples are alike.]]

Some languages use completely different items, such as the [[Serbian language|Serbian]] ''Поредити бабе и жабе'' (comparing grandmothers and toads), or the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''baba şi mitraliera'' (the grandmother and the machine gun); ''vaca şi izmenele'' (the cow and the longjohns); or ''țiganul şi carioca'' (the gypsy and the marker), or the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''mor wahanol â mêl a menyn'' (as different as honey and butter), while some languages compare dissimilar properties of dissimilar items. For example, an equivalent [[Danish language|Danish]] idiom, ''Hvad er højest, [[Rundetårn]] eller et tordenskrald?'' means "What is highest, the Round Tower or a thunderclap?", referring to the size of the former and the sound of the latter. In [[Russian language|Russian]], the phrase ''сравнивать тёплое с мягким'' (to compare warm and soft) is used. In [[Argentina]], a common question is ''¿En qué se parecen el amor y el ojo del hacha?'' (What do love and the eye of an axe have in common?) and emphasizes dissimilarity between two subjects; in [[Colombia]], a similar (though more rude) version is common: ''confundir la mierda con la pomada'' (to confuse shit with ointment). In Polish, the expression ''co ma piernik do wiatraka?'' is used, meaning "What has (is) gingerbread to a windmill?". In Chinese, a phrase that has the similar meaning is 风马牛不相及 (fēng mǎ niú bù xiāng jí), literally meaning "horses and cattles won't mate with each other", and later used to describe things that are totally unrelated and incomparable.

A number of more exaggerated comparisons are sometimes made, in cases in which the speaker believes the two objects being compared are radically different. For example, "oranges with orangutans", "apples with dishwashers", and so on. In English, different fruits, such as pears, plums, or lemons are sometimes substituted for oranges in this context.

Sometimes the two words sound similar, for example, Romanian ''merele cu perele'' (apples and pears) and the Hungarian ''szezont a fazonnal'' (the season with the fashion).

==Published comparisons==
===Scientific===
[[Image:OrangeBloss wb.jpg|thumb|right|Oranges, like apples, grow on trees.]]
At least two [[tongue-in-cheek]] scientific studies have been conducted on the subject, each of which concluded that apples can be compared with oranges fairly easily and on a low budget and the two fruits are quite similar.

The first study, conducted by Scott A. Sandford of the [[NASA Ames Research Center]], used [[infrared spectroscopy]] to analyze both apples and oranges. The study, which was published in the satirical science magazine ''[[Annals of Improbable Research]]'', concluded: "[...] the comparing apples and oranges defense should no longer be considered valid. This is a somewhat startling revelation. It can be anticipated to have a dramatic effect on the strategies used in arguments and discussions in the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Scott A.|last=Sandford|url=https://www.improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume1/v1i3/air-1-3-apples.html|title=Apples and Oranges -- A Comparison|magazine=[[Annals of Improbable Research]]|volume=1|issue=3|date=1995|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second study, written by [[Stamford Hospital]]'s [[surgeon]]-in-chief James Barone and published in the ''[[British Medical Journal]],'' noted that the phrase ''apples and oranges'' was appearing with increasing frequency in the medical literature, with some notable articles comparing "[[Desflurane]] and [[propofol]]" and "[[Salmeterol]] and [[ipratropium]]" with "apples and oranges". The study also found that both apples and oranges were sweet, similar in size, weight, and shape, that both are grown in [[orchard]]s, and both may be eaten, juiced, and so on. The only significant differences found were in terms of [[seed]]s (the study used seedless oranges), the involvement of [[Johnny Appleseed]], and color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Comparing apples and oranges: a randomised prospective study|first=James E|last=Barone|journal=British Medical Journal|year=2000|volume=321|issue=7276|page=1569|doi=10.1136/bmj.321.7276.1569|pmc=27565|pmid=11124178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Annals of Improbable Research'' subsequently noted that the "earlier investigation was done with more depth, more rigour, and, most importantly, more expensive equipment" than the ''British Medical Journal'' study.&lt;ref name="improbable"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abrahams|first1=Marc|title=Apples and oranges have previously been shown to be remarkably similar|journal=BMJ|date=14 April 2001|volume=322|issue=7291|pages=931|pmc=1120087|pmid=11334040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic===
On [[April Fools' Day]] 2014, ''[[The Economist]]'' compared worldwide production of apples and oranges from 1983 to 2013, however noted them to be "unrelated variables".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2014/04/daily-chart|title=Daily chart: Comparing apples with oranges|work=The Economist|date=1 April 2014|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In teaching the use of units==
{{unreferenced-section|date=April 2017}}
While references to comparing apples and oranges are often a [[rhetorical device]], references to adding apples and oranges are made in the case of teaching students the proper uses of [[units of measurement|units]]. Here, the admonition not to "add apples and oranges" refers to the requirement that two quantities with different units may not be combined by addition, although they may always be [[dimensional analysis#Dimensional homogeneity|combined in ratio form by multiplication]], so that multiplying ratios of apples and oranges is allowed. Similarly, the concept of this distinction is often used [[metaphor]]ically in [[elementary algebra]].

The admonition is really more of a [[mnemonic]], since in general counts of objects have no intrinsic unit and, for example, a number count of apples may be dimensionless or have dimension ''fruit''; in either of these two cases, apples and oranges may indeed be added.

'''BRD''' ({{lang-de|'''&lt;u&gt;B&lt;/u&gt;undes&lt;u&gt;r&lt;/u&gt;epublik &lt;u&gt;D&lt;/u&gt;eutschland'''}}; English: Federal Republic of Germany); ({{Audio|De-Bundesrepublik Deutschland.ogg|listen|help=no}}) is an unofficial abbreviation commonly used between 1968 and 1990 by the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|communist regime]] of the [[German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany) to refer to the [[Federal Republic of Germany]], informally known at the time as [[West Germany]]. The East German regime previously used the term "[[German Federal Republic]]" to refer to its western counterpart.

Unlike the [[English language|English]] equivalent '''FRG''', which was used as an [[List of IOC country codes|IOC country code]] and a [[List of FIFA country codes|FIFA trigramme]], the use of ''BRD'' was strongly discouraged by the authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany itself, because it was considered to be a derogatory [[communist]] term.&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-40606777.html Wer BRD sagt, richtet Unheil an], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 25 September 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KTThlFv55ksC&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;ots=R4upIEECw6&amp;dq=brd%20communist%20term%20east%20germany&amp;pg=PR11#v=onepage&amp;q=brd%20communist%20term%20east%20germany&amp;f=true ''Dialectics, Dogmas, and Dissent: Stories from East German Victims of Human Rights Abuse''], John Rodden, Penn State Press, 2010, page xi&lt;/ref&gt; The term was not banned by law, but its use was discouraged or forbidden in schools in Western Germany.&lt;ref name="schulrecht"&gt;[http://www.schulrecht-sh.de/texte/b/brd.htm Erlass der Schulbehörde Schleswig-Holstein], RdErl. vom 4. Oktober 1976 (NBl. KM. Schl.-H. S. 274)&lt;/ref&gt; After [[German reunification]], the country is usually referred to simply as Germany (''{{lang|de|Deutschland}}''), and hence the need for abbreviations is greatly diminished. The most widely used abbreviation for West Germany was its [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] country code "DE", which has remained the country code of reunified Germany.

==History==
[[File:Deutschland Besatzungszonen 1945.svg|thumb|upright|Allied occupation zones in post-war Germany: British (green), Soviet (red), American (orange), French (blue)]]

===Background===
The official name was and is ''Bundesrepublik Deutschland'' ("Federal Republic of Germany"). The name, even though in the beginning referring only to the republic established in the [[Trizone]], was to reflect a name for all of Germany, therefore it was particularly to include the term ''Deutschland'' ("Germany"). This corresponded to the spirit of the then West German constitution, the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]], allowing all [[States of Germany|states or ''Länder'']], then under Allied control, to join the new Federal Republic. In 1949 the original eleven states in the Trizone and [[West Berlin]] did so.&lt;ref&gt;The initial states were the following: [[South Baden|Baden (south)]], [[Bavaria]], [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]], [[Hamburg]], [[Hesse]], [[Lower Saxony]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Württemberg-Baden]], and [[Württemberg-Hohenzollern]]. The latter two and the first merged in [[Baden-Württemberg]] in 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; However the latter was prevented by Allied objection on account of the city being a quadripartite allied occupation area. The [[Saarland]] joined with effect from 1 January 1957, while the [[New states of Germany|"new states"]] of the East did so with effect from 3 October 1990, including reunited Berlin.

Therefore, the term Germany had an importance as part of the official name, which is reflected in the naming conventions which developed in the [[Cold War]]. Starting in June 1949 the abbreviation was sometimes used in the Federal Republic of Germany without any special connotations. The initialism ''BRD'' began to enter into such regular usage in West German scientific and ministerial circles, that it was added to the western edition of the German language dictionary [[Duden]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-8AqAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=duden+brd+1967&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=duden+brd''Deutschland - Ein Name im Wandel''], Helmut Berschin, Olzog, 1979, page 76&lt;/ref&gt; The German Democratic Republic at first used the name ''Westdeutschland'' or "West Germany" (abbreviated "WD") for the Federal Republic of Germany,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rV8fAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Westdeutschland+wd&amp;dq=Westdeutschland+wd&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjU__jHr8nKAhVE2RoKHfPfBG4Q6AEIRDAF ''Deutschland seit 1945: eine dokumentierte gesamtdeutsche Geschichte in der Zeit der Teilung''], Gerhart Binder, Seewald, 1969, page 600&lt;/ref&gt; but since the 1950s the East German government insisted on calling West Germany ''Deutsche Bundesrepublik'' or "German Federal Republic" (abbreviated "DBR"),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_BLwAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=dbr+deutsche+bundesrepublik&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=dbr+ ''Dokumentation zur Deutschlandfrage''], Heinrich Siegler Siegler, 1971, page 46&lt;/ref&gt; because they also considered East Germany part of Germany, and thus would not permit the West German government to use the name "Germany".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ch3P_mZeDZ4C&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;dq=%22Deutsche%20Bundesrepublik%22&amp;pg=PA143#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Deutsche%20Bundesrepublik%22&amp;f=false ''Der Vertrag von Versailles und seine Folgen für die Pfalz oder deutsche Sozialdemokraten verraten Deutschland''], Reinhard Welz Vermittler Verlag e.K., 2004, page 143&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in East Germany===
This changed in 1968 with the [[Constitution of East Germany#1968 constitution|new constitution]] of the German Democratic Republic. The communists no longer strove for German reunification, and the name ''BRD'' was introduced as a [[propaganda]] counter-term to the term ''DDR'', trying to express the equality of the states.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vgoqqs9l7ikC&amp;lpg=PA338&amp;dq=Deutschland%20%E2%80%93%20ein%20Name%20im%20Wandel.%20Die%20deutsche%20Frage%20im%20Spiegel%20der%20Sprache&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q=BRD&amp;f=false ''Bezeichnungen für "Deutschland" in der Zeit der "Wende": dargestellt an ausgewählten westdeutschen Printmedien''], Ute Röding-Lange Königshausen &amp; Neumann, 1997, page 84&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the West would speak of the ''sogenannte DDR'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45935352.html Vom Sogenannten], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 21 October 1968, page 65&lt;/ref&gt; or "so-called 'DDR'"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9gQMAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22so-called+%27DDR%27%22&amp;dq=%22so-called+%27DDR%27%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjp-M_NkMnKAhXEPxoKHUj4BrIQ6AEIIDAA ''Facts about Germany: The Federal Republic of Germany''], 1959 - Germany (West), page 20&lt;/ref&gt; when it had to be belittled.

At that time, the initialism ''BRD'' had been adopted by ''[[Neues Deutschland]]'', the ruling [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]]'s daily newspaper,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nd-archiv.de/ausgabe/1970-12-08 ''Neues Deutschland'', 8 December 1970]&lt;/ref&gt; while East German official sources adopted that initialism as standard in 1973.&lt;ref name="Stefan Schmidt 2009"/&gt;

The East German decision to abandon the idea of a single German nation was accompanied by omitting the terms ''Deutschland'' ("Germany") and ''deutsch'' ("German") in a number of terms, for example:
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-L0827-207, München, XX. Olympiade, Eröffnungsfeier, DDR-Mannschaft.jpg|thumb|East German team at the opening ceremony of the [[1972 Summer Olympics]]]]

* The words of the national anthem, ''[[Auferstanden aus Ruinen]]'', which referred to ''Deutschland, einig Vaterland'' ("Germany, united fatherland") ceased to be sung&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sCKrYdBoYFgC&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;ots=1Y-Gnpd95H&amp;dq=auferstanden%20aus%20ruinen%20words&amp;pg=PA74#v=onepage&amp;q=auferstanden%20aus%20ruinen%20words&amp;f=true ''The German Language in a Changing Europe''], Michael G.

* The state television service, [[Deutscher Fernsehfunk]] became "Fernsehen der DDR" in 1972,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2QpDAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22Fernsehen+der+DDR%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Fernsehen+der+DDR%22+1972 ''Hörfunk und Fernsehen in der DDR: Funktion, Struktur u.

* The [[North German Plain]], covering the north of East and West Germany, appeared in East German atlases as ''Nördliches Tiefland der DDR'' (Northern Plain of the GDR).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-X1OAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=N%C3%B6rdliches+Tiefland+ddr&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=N%C3%B6rdliches+Tiefland++ ''Muttersprache''], 1989, page 158&lt;/ref&gt;
* The GDR sent a separate team to the [[1972 Summer Olympics]], at which its flag and anthem were used for the first time&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Rc1RAQAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;ots=qmwb3hyF94&amp;dq=The%20GDR%20sent%20a%20separate%20team%20to%20the%201972%20Summer%20Olympics%2C%20at%20which%20its%20flag%20and%20anthem%20were%20used%20for%20the%20first%20time.&amp;pg=PA143#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20GDR%20sent%20a%20separate%20team%20to%20the%201972%20Summer%20Olympics,%20at%20which%20its%20flag%20and%20anthem%20were%20used%20for%20the%20first%20time.&amp;f=true ''Sport, Politics, and Communism''], James Riordan, Manchester University Press, 1991, page 143&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1959, the GDR had used an identical flag to that of the Federal Republic, before adopting a version with the [[National Emblem of East Germany|national emblem]] in the centre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aXGTIu5jJDEC&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=east%20germany%20emblem%201959&amp;pg=PA83#v=onepage&amp;q=east%20germany%20emblem%201959&amp;f=true ''Germany from Partition to Reunification''], Henry Ashby Turner, Yale University Press, 1992, page 83&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the ruling party's full name, ''Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands'' or "Socialist Unity Party of Germany" remained unchanged, as did that of its newspaper ''[[Neues Deutschland]]'' ("New Germany") .

[[File:DDR_international_vehicle_registration_oval.svg|thumb|upright|DDR international vehicle registration oval, used between 1974 and 1990.]]
Therefore,  using the abbreviation ''BRD'' fitted perfectly into the official East German policy of downplaying the concept of a united Germany. In 1974, the GDR had replaced the [[List of international vehicle registration codes|vehicle registration code]] ''D'', hitherto shared with the Federal Republic, for ''DDR'' and demanded that West Germany recognise the division by likewise accepting ''BRD''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-41667247.html Kennzeichen BÄÄH], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' 12 August 1974&lt;/ref&gt; 
This was rejected by the West, where some motorists  displayed bumper stickers with the slogan ''BRD - Nein Danke!'' ("BRD? No Thanks!").&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GkI3mUhsrDQC&amp;lpg=PA320&amp;ots=l0RQx0j75Q&amp;dq=%22BRD%22%20nein%20Danke!&amp;pg=PA320#v=onepage&amp;q=%22BRD%22%20nein%20Danke!&amp;f=false ''Kontroverse Begriffe: Geschichte des öffentlichen Sprachgebrauchs in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland''], Georg Stötzel, Martin Wengeler
Walter de Gruyter, 1995, page 320&lt;/ref&gt; Thus in the West the initialism became even more objectionable and using it was often considered either unreflecting or even expressing naïve Communist sympathies.&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt;
 
As a result, the initialism reached only occasional frequency in West German parlance. In order to be precise West Germans increasingly used the terms ''Bundesrepublik'' or ''Bundesgebiet'' ("Federal Republic", or "Federal Territory") to refer to the country and ''Bundesbürger'' ("Federal Citizen[s]") as to its citizens, with the pertaining adjective ''bundesdeutsch'' ([[Federal Germans|federally German]]).

===Opposition to use in West Germany===
To distance themselves from the term ''BRD'', until [[German reunification]], the [[Cabinet of Germany|government of the Federal Republic of Germany]] and media sometimes used the abbreviations ''BR Deutschland,''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7SQun-nAqJAC&amp;lpg=PA307&amp;dq=BR%20Deutschland&amp;pg=PA307#v=onepage&amp;q=BR%20Deutschland&amp;f=false ''Konfession und Wahlverhalten in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland''], Karl Schmitt, Duncker &amp; Humblot, 1989, page 307&lt;/ref&gt; ''BR-Dt.'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qgJeAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22BR+Dt.%22+deutschland&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22BR+Dt.%22+ ''Deutschland-Jahrbuch, Volume 2''], Klaus Mehnert, Heinrich Schulte

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F004665-0003, Walter Hallstein.jpg|thumb|upright|Walter Hallstein]]
West Germany had always claimed to be ''the'' Germany, and did not like the comparison to ''DDR'', or two separate German states. This claim was also reflected in the [[Hallstein Doctrine]] determining its foreign and interior policy until the early 1970s. Named after [[Walter Hallstein]], State secretary at the [[Foreign Office (Germany)|Foreign Office]], this was a key doctrine in the foreign policy of West Germany after 1955, which prescribed that the Federal Republic of Germany would not establish or maintain diplomatic relations with any state that recognised the GDR.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/1989/sep/15/berlinwall.germany The Two Germanies: Rivals struggle for Germany's soul - As worries surface in Bonn about the influx from the East, there are anxieties across Europe about the likely economic and international effects], ''[[The Guardian]]', 15 September 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Although this changed after 1973, with the Federal Republic no longer asserting an [[exclusive mandate]] over the whole of Germany, West Germany only established ''de facto'' diplomatic relations with East Germany. Under the terms of the [[Basic Treaty, 1972|Basic Treaty]] in 1972, [[Bonn]] and [[East Berlin]] exchanged "permanent missions",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chronik-der-mauer.de/index.php/.../Start/Index/id/652004 History of the Berlin Wall]&lt;/ref&gt; headed by "permanent representatives",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/1982/0908/090859.html East-West German trade up 8 percent] ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', 8 September 1982&lt;/ref&gt; rather than ''de jure'' embassies headed by ambassadors. Similarly, relations with the GDR were not conducted through the Foreign Office, but through a separate [[Minister of Intra-German Relations|Federal Ministry for Intra-German Relations]], to which the East German mission was accredited.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PFK7RkdQG14C&amp;pg=PA107&amp;lpg=PA107&amp;dq=Ministry+of+Intra-German+Relations&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TeP4ln6BSF&amp;sig=kapXyUfDiTZORzMuCqPzs9Rzm10&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWtKGmxMvKAhUDwxQKHWR-AewQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Ministry%20of%20Intra-German%20Relations&amp;f=true ''Germany Divided: From the Wall to Reunification''], A. James McAdams
Princeton University Press, 1994, page 107&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 the Federal Minister of All-German Affairs (later Intra-German Relations)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bKt9BgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA191&amp;ots=CdUG2w_KQz&amp;dq=Ministry%20of%20Intra-German%20Relations&amp;pg=PA191#v=onepage&amp;q=Ministry%20of%20Intra-German%20Relations&amp;f=false ''Detente in Europe: Real or Imaginary?''], Josef Korbel, Princeton University Press, 2015, page 191&lt;/ref&gt; issued the ''Directives for the appellation of Germany'' recommending that the use of ''BRD'' be avoided.&lt;ref name="Stefan Schmidt 2009"/&gt; On 31 May 1974 the heads of the federal and state governments recommended that the full name should always be used in official publications. In November 1979 the federal government informed the [[Bundestag]] that the West German public broadcasters [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] and [[ZDF]] agreed not to use the initialism.&lt;ref name="Stefan Schmidt 2009"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110605033550/https://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/analysen/2009/abkuerzung_brd.pdf Stefan Schmidt, "Die Diskussion um den Gebrauch der Abkürzung «BRD»", in: ''Aktueller Begriff'', Deutscher Bundestag – Wissenschaftliche Dienste (ed.)], No. 71/09 (4 September 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the West German federal system, the states were generally responsible for school education, and by the 1970s, some of them had either already recommended omitting the initialism, or, in the case of [[Bavaria]], forbidden it.&lt;ref name="preute"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9KEttd2OaPAC&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;dq=abk%C3%BCrzung%20brd%20schule%20verboten&amp;pg=PA122#v=onepage&amp;q=abk%C3%BCrzung%20brd%20schule%20verboten&amp;f=false ''Rechts um--zum Abitur: der geistige Wandel an deutschen Oberschulen''], Michael Preute
Ch. Links Verlag, 1995, page 122&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a decree by the educational authorities in the state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] of 4 October 1976 declared the term to be ''nicht wünschenswert'' or "undesirable".&lt;ref name="schulrecht" /&gt; The [[Kultusministerkonferenz|conference of all the states ministers for school education]] decided on 12 February 1981 to not print the initialism in books, maps, and atlases for schools.&lt;ref name="Stefan Schmidt 2009"/&gt; with pupils being required to write ''Bundesrepublik Deutschland'' in full and use of the term being deemed an error.&lt;ref name="preute" /&gt; The different usages were so ingrained that one could [[Shibboleth|deduce]] a person's or source's political leaning from the name used for West Germany, with far-left movements in the country using ''BRD''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=F4QnAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=brd+imperialismus&amp;dq=brd+imperialismus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjt_7HTuMnKAhWKXRQKHdw9De4Q6AEIKjAB ''Kampf dem BRD-Imperialismus''], Liga gegen den Imperialismus, 1972, page 30&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as the [[Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache|Association for the German Language]] found, this debate on the initialism had little influence on changing the West German parlance with the usage of the initialism - in any event limited - unaffected by the debate.&lt;ref name="Stefan Schmidt 2009"/&gt;

==Naming difficulties over Berlin and East Germany==
[[File:Occupied Berlin.svg|thumb|Map of divided Berlin, indicating by the broken line at Berlin's western border the territorial redeployment decided by the Allies.]]
A similar ideological question was the question whether to use "Berlin (West)" (the officially preferred name) or "West Berlin", and even whether to write "West Berlin" in [[German language|German]] as two hyphenated words - ''West-Berlin'' - or as one word - ''Westberlin''.&lt;ref name="Glaeser"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=s7kGqJGbaI4C&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=%22Berlin+(West)%22+westberlin+name&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwic28LjsMbKAhVFvRoKHRFoCQwQ6AEIVzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Berlin%20(West)%22%20westberlin%20name&amp;f=true ''Divided in Unity: Identity, Germany, and the Berlin Police''], Andreas Glaeser
University of Chicago Press, 2000, page 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Westerners called the [[West Berlin|Western sectors]] "Berlin", unless further distinction was necessary. The West German Federal government initially called West Berlin ''Groß-Berlin'' or "Greater Berlin",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bundestag.de/blob/284870/ce0d03414872b427e57fccb703634dcd/basic_law-data.pdf Article 127 [Extension of law to the French zone and to Berlin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304075359/https://www.bundestag.de/blob/284870/ce0d03414872b427e57fccb703634dcd/basic_law-data.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}

However, the East German government commonly referred to it as "Westberlin".&lt;ref name="Glaeser" /&gt; Starting from 31 May 1961, East Berlin was officially called ''Berlin, Hauptstadt der DDR'' (Berlin, Capital of the GDR), replacing the formerly used term ''Democratic Berlin'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DhuQAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA344&amp;dq=%22Democratic%20Berlin%22%20gdr&amp;pg=PA344#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Democratic%20Berlin%22%20gdr&amp;f=false ''Architecture, Politics, and Identity in Divided Berlin''], Emily Pugh, University of Pittsburgh Press, 2014, page 344&lt;/ref&gt; or simply "Berlin", by East Germany, and "Berlin (Ost)" by the West German Federal government. Other names used by West German media included ''Ost-Berlin'' and ''Ostberlin'' (both meaning "East Berlin") as well as ''Ostsektor'' or "Eastern Sector".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FMmOAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Ostsektor%22&amp;dq=%22Ostsektor%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwif8MfN8sjKAhVJPRQKHXPQA_EQ6AEI3AEwGw ''Der Rechtsstatus des Landes Berlin''], Ernst Renatus Zivier, Berlin Verlag, 1974, page 53&lt;/ref&gt; These different naming conventions for the divided parts of Berlin, when followed by individuals, governments, or media, commonly indicated their political leanings, with the centre-right ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' using "Ost-Berlin" and the centre-left ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' using "Ostberlin".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vgoqqs9l7ikC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;lpg=PA149&amp;dq=%22Ost+Berlin%22,+%22Ostberlin%22,+or+%22Ostsektor%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dUlLgVcMcg&amp;sig=yg5HL2-Z23u3emp_z7D_ikH9sc0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjoo6r-yrbKAhWGwxQKHeiNBxIQ6AEIUDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ost%20Berlin%22%2C%20%22Ostberlin%22%2C%20or%20%22Ostsektor%22&amp;f=true ''Bezeichnungen für "Deutschland" in der Zeit der "Wende": dargestellt an ausgewählten westdeutschen Printmedien''], Ute Röding-Lange Königshausen &amp; Neumann, 1997, page 149&lt;/ref&gt;

The naming of the German Democratic Republic was also a controversial issue, West Germans at first preferring the names [[Middle Germany|''Mitteldeutschland'' ("Middle Germany")]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Lv_GCXcA8IYC&amp;lpg=PA209&amp;ots=H0OlpCONF6&amp;dq=%22BRd%22%20mitteldeutschland&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q=mitteldeutschland&amp;f=false ''Die Agrarpolitik in Mitteldeutschland: und ihre Auswirkung auf Produktion und Verbrauch landwirtschaftlicher Erzeugnisse''], Edgar Tümmler, Konrad Merkel, Georg Blohm, Duncker &amp; Humblot, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Soviet Zone of occupation in Germany|''Sowjetische Besatzungszone'' (Soviet Occupation Zone)]] abbreviated as ''SBZ''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=s8uGOqBCek8C&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=sbz%20deutschland&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;q=sbz%20deutschland&amp;f=true ''Das Widerstandsrecht: Entwickelt anhand d. höchstrichterl.

==Similar naming difficulties==
[[File:Germany Slovakia Locator.png|thumb|Germany (green) Slovakia (orange)]]
In 1995, a disagreement arose between reunified Germany and newly independent [[Slovakia]], as Germany objected to the use of the [[Slovak language]] name ''Nemecká spolková republika'' (literally  "German Federal Republic") owing to its Cold War connotations, instead of ''Spolková republika Nemecko''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kas.de/wf/doc/kas_20393-544-2-30.pdf?100831124854 Proven Partnerships with Development Potential: Germany’s relations with the Czech Republic and Slovakia], Konrad Adenauer-Stiftung, September 2010, page 47&lt;/ref&gt; This was almost identical to the equivalent ''Spolková republika Německo'' in [[Czech language|Czech]], a language closely related to Slovak,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mzv.cz/jnp/cz/encyklopedie_statu/evropa/nemecko/ Německo], [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Czech Republic)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], Czech Republic&lt;/ref&gt; but the Slovak authorities claimed that "Federal Republic of Germany" could not be translated grammatically into Slovak.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/semantic-spat-pits-german-against-slovak/336090.html Semantic Spat Pits German Against Slovak], ''[[Moscow Times]]'', Tony Barber, 10 August 1995&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Government of Slovakia|Slovak government]] had used it until the previous year, leading to suggestions in the Bratislava newspaper ''Narodna Obroda'' that they were using "German Federal Republic" to show their displeasure with German attitudes to the country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/name-calling-upsets-the-federal-republic-1594837.html Name-calling upsets the Federal Republic], ''[[The Independent]]'', 4 August 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Brand Book''' records all [[Livestock branding|livestock brands]] registered with an organization. In the U.S. most states have branding laws that require brands to be registered before use. This may be a state agency (usually affiliated with each state's [[List of agriculture ministries|Department of Agriculture]]) or a private association regulated by the state. Most states with such laws have a Brand Book for the entire state. [[Texas]], an exception, registers brands at the county level. These book are usually provided free to law enforcement personnel and County Extension Agents. Some states have their Brand Books available online.

A typical Brand Book will usually have an image of the brand, the location of the brand on the animal, and the type of animal that will be branded, as well as the owner of the brand. Many Brand Books also record earmarks.

Brand Books are used by law enforcement officials, brand inspectors, and association investigators to record and track livestock movement, deter loss of livestock by straying or theft, and prosecute thieves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28836">[[File:John 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Gospel according to John]] - a text showing chapter and verse divisions ([[King James Version]])]]

The [[Bible]] is a compilation of many [[books of the Bible|shorter books]] written at different times by a variety of authors, and later assembled into the [[biblical canon]]. Since the early 13th century, most copies and editions of the Bible present all but the shortest of these books with divisions into [[chapter (books)| chapters]], generally a page or so in length. Since the mid-16th century editors have further subdivided each chapter into verses - each consisting of a few short lines or sentences. Sometimes a sentence spans more than one verse, as in the case of {{bibleref2|Ephesians|2:8–9|9}}, and sometimes there is more than one sentence in a single verse, as in the case of {{bibleref2|Genesis|1:2|9}}.

As the chapter and verse divisions did not appear in the original texts, they form part of the [[paratext]] of the Bible.

The Jewish divisions of the Hebrew text differ at various points from those used by Christians.  For instance, in Jewish tradition, the ascriptions to many [[Psalms]] are regarded as independent verses or parts of the subsequent verses, making 116 more verses, whereas established Christian practice treats each Psalm ascription as independent and unnumbered.  Some chapter divisions also occur in different places, e.g. Hebrew Bibles have  {{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|5:27–41|HE}} where Christian translations have {{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|6:1–15|NIV}}.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==History==
[[File:Isaiah Wall.jpg|thumb|left|"...they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more." ~ [[Isaiah 2:4]] KJV (Bible verse across the street from the [[United Nations Building]] in [[New York City]])]]

===Chapters===
Early manuscripts of the biblical texts did not contain the chapter and verse divisions in the numbered form familiar to modern readers.  In antiquity Hebrew texts were divided into paragraphs ([[parashot]]) that were identified by two letters of the [[Hebrew alphabet]]. [[Pe (letter)|Peh פ]] indicated an "open" paragraph that began on a new line, while [[Samekh|Samekh ס]] indicated a "closed" paragraph that began on the same line after a small space.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Würthwein, ''The Text of the Old Testament'' (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1998), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; These two letters begin the Hebrew words open ('''''p'''atuach'') and closed ('''''s'''agoor''), and are, themselves, open פ and closed ס. The earliest known copies of the [[Book of Isaiah]] from the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] used parashot divisions, although they differ slightly from the [[Masoretic text|Masoretic]] divisions.&lt;ref name=Wurthwein-2&gt;Würthwein, ''The Text of the Old Testament'', n. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; (This is different from the use of consecutive letters of the Hebrew alphabet to structure certain poetic compositions, known as [[acrostic]]s, such as several of the [[Psalms]] and most of the [[Book of Lamentations]].)

The [[Hebrew Bible]] was also divided into some larger sections.  In Israel the [[Torah]] (its first five books) were divided into 154 sections so that they could be read through aloud in weekly worship over the course of three years. In Babylonia it was divided into 53 or 54 sections ([[Parashat ha-Shavua]]) so it could be read through in one year.&lt;ref name=Wurthwein-2/&gt;  The [[New Testament]] was divided into topical sections known as ''kephalaia'' by the fourth century. [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] divided the gospels into parts that he listed in tables or ''canons''. Neither of these systems corresponds with modern chapter divisions.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt and Barbara Aland, ''The Text of the New Testament'' (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans and Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1989), pp. 252 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  (See fuller discussions below.)

Chapter divisions, with titles, are also found in the 9th century Tours manuscript, Paris Bibliothèque Nationale MS Lat. 3, the so-called Bible of Rorigo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europeanaregia.eu/en/manuscripts/paris-bibliotheque-nationale-france-mss-latin-3/en|title=Europeana Regia - Paris Bibliothèque nationale de France MSS Latin 3|first=Europeana Regia|last=Consortium|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archbishop [[Stephen Langton#Chapters of the Bible|Stephen Langton]] and Cardinal [[Hugo de Sancto Caro]] developed different schemas for systematic division of the Bible in the early 13th century. It is the system of Archbishop Langton on which the modern chapter divisions are based.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07175a.htm Hebrew Bible] article in the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Moore/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce M. Metzger]], ''The early versions of the New Testament: Their origin, transmission and limitations'', Oxford University Press (1977), p.347. Cited in [http://www.roger-pearse.com/weblog/2013/06/21/stephen-langton-and-the-modern-chapter-divisions-of-the-bible/ Stephen Langton and the modern chapter divisions of the bible] by British translator Roger Pearse, 21 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

While chapter divisions have become nearly universal, editions of the Bible have sometimes been published without them.  Such editions, which typically use thematic or literary criteria to divide the biblical books instead, include [[John Locke|John Locke's]] ''Paraphrase and Notes on the Epistles of St. Paul'' (1707),&lt;ref&gt;London: Awnsham and John Churchill, 1707&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell's]] ''The Sacred Writings'' (1826),&lt;ref&gt;1826; repr.

===Verses===
Since at least 916 the [[Tanakh]] has contained an extensive system of multiple levels of section, paragraph, and phrasal divisions that were indicated in [[Masoretic]] vocalization and [[cantillation|cantillation markings]].&lt;!-- page 75 --&gt; One of the most frequent of these was a special type of punctuation, the ''[[sof passuq]]'', symbol for a full stop or sentence break, resembling the [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] (:) of English and Latin orthography. With the advent of the printing press and the translation of the [[Bible]] into English, Old Testament versifications were made that correspond predominantly with the existing Hebrew full stops, with a few isolated exceptions. Most attribute these to Rabbi [[Isaac Nathan ben Kalonymus]]'s work for the first Hebrew [[Bible concordance]] around 1440.&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;Moore, G.F. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3259119 The Vulgate Chapters and Numbered Verses in the Hebrew Bible], pages 73–78 at [[JSTOR]]. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3259119?seq=3 page 75]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first person to divide New Testament chapters into verses was Italian Dominican biblical scholar [[Santi Pagnini]] (1470–1541), but his system was never widely adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bible: A History|author1=Miller, Stephen M. |author2=Huber, Robert V. |year=2004|publisher=Good Books|isbn=1-56148-414-8|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; His verse divisions in the New Testament were far longer than those known today.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://tools.pitts.emory.edu/Printer/|title = Pitts Theology Library Exhibit on the Verses of the New Testament|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Estienne]] created an alternate numbering in his 1551 edition of the Greek New Testament&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblestudymagazine.com/interactive/chaptersverses/ "Chapters and Verses: Who Needs Them?,"] Christopher R. Smith, Bible Study Magazine (July–Aug 2009): 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; which was also used in his 1553 publication of the Bible in French. Estienne's system of division was widely adopted, and it is this system which is found in almost all modern Bibles. Estienne produced a 1555 Vulgate that is the first Bible to include the verse numbers integrated into the text. Before this work, they were printed in the margins.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The first English New Testament to use the verse divisions was a 1557 translation by [[William Whittingham]] (c. 1524–1579). The first Bible in English to use both chapters and verses was the [[Geneva Bible]] published shortly afterwards in 1560. These verse divisions soon gained acceptance as a standard way to notate verses, and have since been used in nearly all English Bibles and the vast majority of those in other languages.  (Nevertheless, some Bibles have removed the verse numbering, including the ones noted above that also removed chapter numbers; a recent example of an edition that removed only verses, not chapters, is [[The Message (Bible)|''The Message: The Bible in Contemporary Language'']] by [[Eugene H. Peterson]].)&lt;ref&gt;Colorado Springs: NavPress, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish tradition==
{{Main article|Tanakh#Chapters and verse numbers, book divisions}}
The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Masoretic text]] of the Bible notes several different kinds of subdivisions within the biblical books:

===Verse endings===
{{Main article|Sof passuk}}
Most important are the verse endings. According to the [[Talmud]]ic tradition, the division of the text into verses is of ancient origin.&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud, ''Nedarim'' 37b&lt;/ref&gt; In Masoretic versions of the Bible, the end of a verse is indicated by a small mark in its final word called a ''silluq'' (which means "stop"). Less formally, verse endings are usually also indicated by two horizontal dots following the word with a ''silluq''.

===Parashiyot===
{{main article|Parashah}}
The Masoretic textual tradition also contains section endings called ''[[Parashah|parashot]]'', which are usually indicated by a space within a line (a "closed" section) or a new line beginning (an "open" section). The division of the text reflected in the ''parashot'' is usually thematic. Unlike chapters, the ''parashot'' are not numbered, but some of them have special titles.

In early manuscripts (most importantly in [[Tiberian vocalization|Tiberian]] Masoretic manuscripts, such as the [[Aleppo codex]]), an "open" section may also be represented by a blank line, and a "closed" section by a new line that is slightly indented (the preceding line may also not be full). These latter conventions are no longer used in Torah scrolls and printed [[Hebrew Bible]]s. In this system, the one rule differentiating "open" and "closed" sections is that "open" sections must ''always'' start at the beginning of a new line, while "closed" sections ''never'' start at the beginning of a new line.

===Sedarim===
Another division of the biblical books found in the Masoretic text is the division of the ''[[Seder (Bible)|sedarim]]''. This division is not thematic, but is almost entirely based upon the ''quantity'' of text. For the [[Torah]], this division reflects the triennial cycle of reading that was practiced by the Jews of the Land of Israel.

==Christian versions==
The Byzantines also introduced a concept roughly similar to chapter divisions, called ''kephalaia'' (singular ''kephalaion'', literally meaning ''heading'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetextofthegospels.com/2016/04/kephalaia-ancient-chapters-of-gospels.html |title=Kephalaia: The Ancient Chapters of the Gospels |last=Snapp | first=James |date=15 April 2016 |accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system, which was in place no later than the 5th century, is not identical to the present chapters. Unlike the modern chapters, which tend to be of roughly similar length, the distance from one ''kephalaion'' mark to the next varied greatly in length both within a book and from one book to the next.  For example, the [[Sermon on the Mount]], comprising three chapters in the modern system, has but one ''kephalaion'' mark, while the single modern chapter 8 of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] has several, one per miracle.  Moreover, there were far fewer ''kephalaia'' in the [[Gospel of John]] than in the [[Gospel of Mark]], even though the latter is the shorter text. In the manuscripts, the ''kephalaia'' with their numbers, their standard titles (''titloi'') and their page numbers would be listed at the beginning of each biblical book; in the book's main body, they would be marked only with arrow-shaped or asterisk-like symbols in the margin, not in the text itself.

The titles usually referred to the first event or the first theological point of the section only, and some ''kephalaia'' are manifestly incomplete if one stops reading at the point where the next ''kephalaion'' begins (for example, the combined accounts of the miracles of the [[Daughter of Jairus]] and of the [[Christ healing the bleeding woman|healing of the woman with a haemorrhage]]  gets two marked ''kephalaia'', one titled ''of the daughter of the synagogue ruler'' at the beginning when the ruler approaches Jesus and one titled ''of the woman with the flow of blood'' where the woman enters the picture – well before the ruler's daughter is healed and the storyline of the previous ''kephalaion'' is thus properly concluded). Thus the ''kephalaia'' marks are rather more like a system of bookmarks or links into a continuous text, helping a reader to quickly find one of several well-known episodes, than like a true system of chapter divisions.

Cardinal [[Hugh of St Cher|Hugo de Sancto Caro]] is often given credit for first dividing the [[Latin Vulgate]] into chapters in the real sense, but it is the arrangement of his contemporary and fellow cardinal [[Stephen Langton]] who in 1205 created the chapter divisions which are used today. They were then inserted into Greek manuscripts of the New Testament in the 16th century. [[Robert Estienne]] (Robert Stephanus) was the first to number the verses within each chapter, his verse numbers entering printed editions in 1551 (New Testament) and 1571 (Hebrew Bible).&lt;ref name = "Examiner"&gt;[http://www.theexaminer.org/history/chap6.htm The Examiner].&lt;/ref&gt;

The division of the Bible into chapters and verses has received criticism from some traditionalists and modern scholars. Critics state that the text is often divided in an incoherent way, or at inappropriate rhetorical points, and that it encourages citing passages out of context. Nevertheless, the chapter and verse numbers have become indispensable as technical references for Bible study.

Several modern publications of the Bible have eliminated numbering of chapters and verses. [[Biblica]] published such a version of the [[NIV]] in 2007 and 2011. In 2014, [[Crossway Books|Crossway]] published the [[ESV]] Reader's Bible and ''[[Bibliotheca (Bible)|Bibliotheca]]'' published a modified ASV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zylstra |first=Sarah Eekhof |title=Introducing the Bible!

=={{anchor|Statistics}}Protestant Bible statistics==
The number of words can vary depending upon aspects such as whether the Hebrew alphabet in Psalm 119, the superscriptions listed in some of the Psalms, and the subscripts traditionally found at the end of the Pauline epistles, are included.
Except where stated, the following apply to the [[King James Version]] of the Bible in its modern 66-book Protestant form including the New Testament and the [[protocanonical]] Old Testament, not the [[deuterocanonical books]].

===Chapters===
* There are 929 chapters in the [[Old Testament]].
** 187 chapters in the Pentateuch
** 249 chapters in the Historical books
** 243 chapters in the Poetic books ("Wisdom")
** 183 chapters in the Major prophets
** 67 chapters in the Minor prophets
* There are 260 chapters in the [[New Testament]]. 
** 89 chapters in the Gospels
** 28 chapters in Acts
** 87 chapters in the Pauline Epistles (excluding Hebrews)
** 34 chapters in the General Epistles (including Hebrews)
** 22 chapters in Revelation
* This gives a total of 1,189 chapters (on average, 18 per book).
* Psalm 117, the shortest chapter, is also the middle chapter of the Bible, being the 595th Chapter.&lt;ref name=midbible&gt;[http://www.breakthechain.org/exclusives/midbible.html The Center of the Bible] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050828035123/http://www.breakthechain.org/exclusives/midbible.html |date=August 28, 2005 }} at BreakTheChain.org&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{bibleverse||Psalm|119|ESV}} is the longest chapter of the Bible.
* Five books are a single chapter: Obadiah, Philemon, 2 &amp; 3 John, Jude. In many printed editions, the chapter number is omitted for these books, and references just use the verse numbers.

===Verses===
* There are 23,145 verses in the Old Testament and 7,957 verses in the New Testament. This gives a total of 31,102 verses,&lt;ref name="blueletterbiblebooks"&gt;[https://www.blueletterbible.org/study/misc/66books.cfm Study Resources: The Books of the Bible] at BlueLetterBible.org&lt;/ref&gt; which is an average of a little more than 26 verses per chapter.
* Contrary to popular belief, Psalm 118 does not contain the middle verse of the Bible. The King James Version has an even number of verses (31,102), with the two middle verses being {{bibleverse||Psalm|103:1–2|KJV}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblebelievers.com/believers-org/kjv-stats.html King James Bible Statistics] at BibleBelievers.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{bibleref|John|11:35|NASB}} ("[[Jesus wept]]") is the shortest verse in most English translations. Some translations — including the New International Version, New Living Translation, New Life Version, Holman Christian Standard Bible and New International Reader's Version — render {{bibleverse||Job|3:2|HE}} as "He said". However, that is a translators' condensation of the Hebrew which literally translated is: "And Job answered and said."
&lt;!-- non English stats --&gt;
* The shortest verse in the [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Greek New Testament]] is {{bibleverse||Luke|20:30|NASB}} ("και ο δευτερος", "And the second") with twelve letters, according to the [[The New Testament in the Original Greek|Westcott and Hort]] text. In the [[Textus Receptus]], the shortest verse is {{bibleverse|1|Thessalonians|5:16|NASB}} ("παντοτε χαιρετε", "Rejoice always") with fourteen letters,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bible.org/page.php?page_id=5585 First Thessalonians 5:12–28], [[John Walvoord]] at Bible.org&lt;/ref&gt; since [[Robert Estienne|Stephanus]]' rendering of Luke 20:30 includes some additional words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studybible.info/LXX_WH-IGNT-KJV/Luke%2020:30 Luke 20:30 και ο δευτερος – and the second] with interlinear Greek-English and KJV&lt;br&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%2020:30&amp;version=TR1550;WHNU Luke 20:30], in the 1550 [[Robert Estienne|Stephanus]] New Testament and the 1881 [[The New Testament in the Original Greek|Westcott-Hort]] New Testament.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{bibleref|Isaiah|10:8|ESV}} ("''Dicet enim''") is the shortest verse in the Latin [[Vulgate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latinvulgate.com/verse.aspx?t=0&amp;b=27&amp;c=10 Isaias 10] at LatinVulgate.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{bibleverse||Esther|8:9|ESV}} is the longest verse in the Masoretic Text. The discovery of several manuscripts at [[Qumran]] (in the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]) has reopened what is considered the most original text of 1 Samuel 11; if one believes that those manuscripts better preserve the text, several verses in 1 Samuel 11 surpass Esther 8:9 in length.

A '''circular reference''' is a series of [[reference]]s where the last object references the first, resulting in a closed loop.
[[File:Circular Reference.svg|thumb|Circular reference (in red)]]

==In language==
A circular reference is not to be confused with the logical fallacy of a [[circular argument]].  Although a circular reference will often be unhelpful and reveal no information, such as two entries in a book index referring to each other, it is not necessarily so that a circular reference is of no use.  Dictionaries, for instance, must always ultimately be a circular reference since all words in a dictionary are defined in terms of other words, but a dictionary nevertheless remains a useful reference.  Sentences containing circular references can still be meaningful;

:''Her brother gave her a kitten; his sister thanked him for it.''

is circular but not without meaning.  Indeed, it can be argued that self-reference is a necessary consequence of Aristotle's [[Law of non-contradiction]], a fundamental philosophical [[axiom]].  In this view, without self-reference, [[logic]] and [[mathematics]] become impossible, or at least, lack usefulness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Terry A. Osborn]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=fvJTwwCSy8UC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=%22circular+reference%22+-excel+-computer+-programming&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=39#v=onepage&amp;q=%22circular%20reference%22%20-excel%20-computer%20-programming&amp;f=true ''The future of foreign language education in the United States''], pp.31-33, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002 {{ISBN|0-89789-719-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fiengo&gt;Robert Fiengo, Robert May, [https://books.google.com/books?id=V77kaAVpU0UC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=%22circular+reference%22+-excel+-computer+-programming&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=9#v=onepage&amp;q=%22circular%20reference%22%20-excel%20-computer%20-programming&amp;f=true ''Indices and identity''], pp.59-62, MIT Press, 1994 {{ISBN|0-262-56076-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In computer programming==
{{For|circular references between objects or resources|Reference counting}}

Circular references can appear in [[computer programming]] when one piece of code requires the result from another, but that code needs the result from the first. For example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Function A will show the time the sun last set based on the current date, which it can obtain by calling Function B. Function B will calculate the date based on the number of times the moon has orbited the earth since the last time Function B was called.  So, Function B asks Function C just how many times that is.  Function C doesn't know, but can figure it out by calling Function A to get the time the sun last set.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The entire set of functions is now worthless because none of them can return any useful information whatsoever.  This leads to what is technically known as a [[livelock]].  It also appears in [[spreadsheet]]s when two cells require each other's result.  For example, if the value in Cell A1 is to be obtained by adding 5 to the value in Cell B1, and the value in Cell B1 is to be obtained by adding 3 to the value in Cell A1, no values can be computed.  (Even if the specifications are A1:=B1+5 and B1:=A1-5, there is still a circular reference.  It doesn't help that, for instance, A1=3 and B1=-2 would satisfy both formulae, as there are infinitely many other possible values of A1 and B1 that can satisfy both instances.)

A circular reference represents a big problem in computing.

In ISO Standard SQL circular integrity constraints are implicitly supported within a single table. Between multiple tables circular constraints (e.g. foreign keys) are permitted by defining the constraints as deferrable (See [http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createtable.html CREATE TABLE] for PostgreSQL and [http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/clauses002.htm#i1015767 DEFERRABLE Constraint Examples] for Oracle). In that case the constraint is checked at the end of the transaction not at the time the DML statement is executed. To update a circular reference two statements can be issued in a single transaction that will satisfy both references once the transaction is committed.

A distinction should be made with processes containing a circular reference between those that are incomputable and those that are an iterative calculation with a final output.  The latter may fail in spreadsheets not equipped to handle them but are nevertheless still logically valid.&lt;ref name=Fiengo/&gt;

==In spreadsheets==
Circular reference in worksheets can be a very useful technique for solving implicit equations such as the [[Colebrook equation]] and many others, which might otherwise require tedious Newton-Raphson algorithms in VBA or use of macros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Solve Implicit Equations Inside Your Worksheet By Anilkumar M, Dr Sreenivasan E and Dr Raghunathan K |url=http://www.frpdesigns.com/iteration.htm}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2898">The '''Citation Style Language''' ('''CSL''') is an open [[XML]]-based language to describe the formatting of [[citation]]s and [[bibliographic|bibliographies]]. [[Reference management software|Reference management programs]] using CSL include [[Zotero]], [[Mendeley]] and [[Papers (software)|Papers]].

==History==

CSL was created by Bruce D'Arcus for use with [[OpenOffice.org]],&lt;ref&gt;CiteProc at OpenOffice Bibliographic Project. http://bibliographic.openoffice.org/citeproc/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;OpenOffice Bibliographic Project. http://bibliographic.openoffice.org/&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[XSLT]]-based "[[CiteProc]]" CSL processor. CSL was further developed in collaboration with [[Zotero]] developer Simon Kornblith. Since 2008, the core development team consists of D'Arcus, Frank Bennett and Rintze Zelle.

The releases of CSL are 0.8 (March 21, 2009), 0.8.1 (February 1, 2010), 1.0 (March 22, 2010), and 1.0.1 (September 3, 2012). CSL 1.0 was a backward-incompatible release, but styles in the 0.8.1 format can be automatically updated to the CSL 1.0 format.&lt;ref&gt;Update instructions to convert CSL 0.8.1 styles to the 1.0 format. http://citationstyles.org/downloads/upgrade-notes.html#updating-csl-0-8-styles&lt;/ref&gt;

On its release in 2006, [[Zotero]] became the first application to adopt CSL. In 2008 [[Mendeley]] was released with CSL support, and in 2011, [[Papers (software)|Papers]] and [[Qiqqa]] gained support for CSL-based citation formatting.

==Software support==

The '''Comparative Toxicogenomics Database''' ('''CTD''') is a public website and research tool launched in November 2004 that curates scientific data describing relationships between chemicals/drugs, genes/proteins, diseases, taxa, phenotypes, GO annotations, pathways, and interaction modules.
The database is maintained by the Department of Biological Sciences at [[North Carolina State University]].

==Background==
The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) is a public website and research tool that curates scientific data describing relationships between chemicals, genes/proteins, diseases, taxa, phenotypes, GO annotations, pathways, and interaction modules, launched on November 12, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mattingly CJ, Rosenstein MC, Colby GT, Forrest JN, Boyer JL |title=The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD): A Resource for Comparative Toxicological Studies |journal=J Exp Zoolog.

The database is maintained by the Department of Biological Sciences at North Carolina State University.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Goals and objectives==
One of the primary goals of CTD is to advance the understanding of the effects of environmental chemicals on human health on the genetic level, a field called [[toxicogenomics]].

The [[etiology]] of many chronic diseases involves interactions between environmental factors and genes that modulate important physiological processes. Chemicals are an important component of the environment. Conditions such as [[asthma]], cancer, [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[hypertension]], [[immunodeficiency]], and [[Parkinson's disease]] are known to be influenced by the environment; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying these correlations are not well understood. CTD may help resolve these mechanisms. The most up-to-date extensive list of peer-reviewed scientific articles about CTD is available at their publications page&lt;ref&gt;[http://ctdbase.org/about/publications/#ctdpubs CTD Publications page] ctdbase.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core data==
CTD is a unique resource where [[biocurator]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bourne PE, McEntyre J |title=Biocurators: Contributors to the World of Science |journal=PLoS Comput. Biol. |volume=2 |issue=10 |pages=e142 |date=Oct 2006 |pmid=17411327 |pmc=1626157 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020142 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Salimi N, Vita R |title=The Biocurator: Connecting and Enhancing Scientific Data |journal=PLoS Comput. Biol. |volume=2 |issue=10 |pages=e125 |date=Oct 2006 |pmid=17069454 |pmc=1626147 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; read the scientific literature and manually curate four types of core data:

* Chemical-gene interactions
* Chemical-disease associations
* Gene-disease associations
* Chemical-phenotype associations

==Data integration==
By integrating the above four data sets, CTD automatically constructs putative chemical-gene-phenotype-disease networks to illuminate molecular mechanisms underlying environmentally-influenced diseases.

These inferred relationships are statistically scored and ranked and can be used by scientists and computational biologists to generate and verify testable hypotheses about toxicogenomic mechanisms and how they relate to human health.

Users can search CTD to explore scientific data for chemicals, genes, diseases, or interactions between any of these three concepts.  Currently,{{when|date=November 2015}} CTD integrates toxicogenomic data for vertebrates and invertebrates.

'''Comparative biology''' uses natural variation and disparity to understand the patterns of life at all levels—from genes to communities—and the critical role of organisms in ecosystems.  Comparative biology is a cross-lineage approach to understanding the phylogenetic history of individuals or higher [[taxa]] and the mechanisms and patterns that drives it. Comparative biology encompasses [[Evolutionary Biology]], [[Systematics]], [[Neontology]], [[Paleontology]], [[Ethology]], [[Anthropology]], and [[Biogeography]] as well as historical approaches to [[Developmental biology]], [[Genomics]], [[Physiology]], [[Ecology]] and many other areas of the biological sciences.The comparative approach also has numerous applications in human health, [[genetics]], [[biomedicine]], and [[conservation biology]]. The biological relationships (phylogenies, pedigree) are important for comparative analyses and usually represented by a [[phylogenetic tree]] or [[cladogram]] to differentiate those features with single origins ([[Homology (biology)|Homology]]) from those with multiple origins ([[Homoplasy]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1347">The '''comparative case''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''comp'''}}) is a [[grammatical case]] used in languages such as [[Mari language|Mari]] and [[Chechen language|Chechen]] to mark a likeness to something. 

It is not to be confused with the [[comparison (grammar)|comparative degree]], a much more widely used paradigm used to signify heightening of [[adjectives]] and [[adverbs]].

In Mari, the comparative case is marked with the suffix -ла ('-la')  For example, if something were to taste like fish (кол - 'kol'), the form used would be колла - 'kolla'). It is also used in regard to languages, when denoting the language a person is speaking, writing, or hearing. Then, however, the accentuation varies slightly from the standard case. Usually, the suffix is not stressed. When it is used with languages, however, it is stressed.

In Chechen, it is marked with the suffix ''-l''. For example, ''sha'' is 'ice', ''shiila'' is 'cold', and ''shal shiila'' is 'cold as ice'.

'''Comparative cultural studies''' is a contextual approach to the study of culture in a global and intercultural context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepress.purdue.edu/series/comparative-cultural-studies|title=Comparative Cultural Studies|publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=October 32, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Focus is placed on the theory, method, and application of the study process(es) rather than on the "what" of the object(s) of study.

==Overview==
In comparative cultural studies, selected tenets of [[comparative literature]] are merged with selected tenets of the field of [[cultural studies]] (including [[cultural theory|culture theories]], (radical) [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivism]], [[communication]] theories, and [[systems theories]]) with the objective to study culture and culture products (including but not restricted to literature, communication, media, art, etc.). This is performed in a contextual and relational construction and with a plurality of methods and approaches, interdisciplinary, and, if and when required, including teamwork. In comparative cultural studies, it is the processes of communicative action(s) in culture and the how of these processes that constitute the main objectives of research and study. However, scholarship in comparative cultural studies does not exclude [[textual analysis]] proper of other established fields of study. In comparative cultural studies, ideally, the framework of and methodologies available in the systemic and empirical study of culture are favored. Scholarship in comparative cultural studies includes the theoretical, as well as methodological and applied postulate to move and to dialogue between cultures, languages, literature, and disciplines: attention to other cultures against essentialist notions and practices and beyond the paradigm of the nation-state is a basic and founding element of the framework and its application.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40861">'''Comparative genomic hybridization''' is a molecular [[cytogenetic]] method for analysing [[copy number variations]] (CNVs) relative to [[ploidy]] level in the DNA of a test sample compared to a reference sample, without the need for culturing cells.  The aim of this technique is to quickly and efficiently compare two genomic DNA samples arising from two sources, which are most often closely related, because it is suspected that they contain differences in terms of either gains or losses of either whole [[chromosomes]] or [[Chromosome regions|subchromosomal regions]] (a portion of a whole chromosome).  This technique was originally developed for the evaluation of the differences between the chromosomal complements of solid tumor and normal tissue,&lt;ref name="Kallioniemi,Kallioniemi,Sudar,Rutovitz,Gray,Waldman,Pinkel"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kallioniemi A, Kallioniemi OP, Sudar DA, Rutovitz D, Gray JW, Waldman F, Pinkel D | year = 1992 | title = Comparative genomic hybridization for molecular cytogenetic analysis of solid tumors | url = | journal = Science | volume = 258 | issue = 5083| pages = 818–821 | doi=10.1126/science.1359641}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has an improved resolution of 5–10 [[megabases]] compared to the more traditional cytogenetic analysis techniques of [[giemsa banding]] and [[fluorescence in situ hybridization]] (FISH) which are limited by the resolution of the microscope utilized.&lt;ref name="Strachan"&gt;Strachan T, Read AP (2010) Human Molecular Genetics: Garland Science.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest"&gt;Weiss M, Hermsen M, Meijer G, Van Grieken N, Baak J, Kuipers E, Van Diest P (1999) Comparative genomic hybridization. Molecular Pathology 52:243–251.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is achieved through the use of competitive fluorescence in situ hybridization. In short, this involves the isolation of DNA from the two sources to be compared, most commonly a test and reference source, independent labelling of each DNA sample with [[fluorophores]] (fluorescent molecules) of different colours (usually red and green), [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]] of the DNA so that it is single stranded, and the [[Nucleic acid hybridization|hybridization]] of the two resultant samples in a 1:1 ratio to a normal [[metaphase]] spread of chromosomes, to which the labelled DNA samples will bind at their [[locus (genetics)|locus]] of origin.  Using a fluorescence microscope and computer software, the differentially coloured fluorescent signals are then compared along the length of each chromosome for identification of chromosomal differences between the two sources. A higher intensity of the test sample colour in a specific region of a chromosome indicates the gain of material of that region in the corresponding source sample, while a higher intensity of the reference sample colour indicates the loss of material in the test sample in that specific region. A neutral colour (yellow when the fluorophore labels are red and green) indicates no difference between the two samples in that location.&lt;ref name="Strachan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest" /&gt;

CGH is only able to detect unbalanced [[chromosomal abnormality|chromosomal abnormalities]].  This is because balanced chromosomal abnormalities such as [[chromosomal translocation|reciprocal translocations]], [[chromosomal inversion|inversions]] or [[ring chromosomes]] do not affect copy number, which is what is detected by CGH technologies. CGH does, however, allow for the exploration of all 46 human chromosomes in single test and the discovery of deletions and duplications, even on the microscopic scale which may lead to the identification of [[candidate gene]]s to be further explored by other cytological techniques.&lt;ref name="Strachan" /&gt;

Through the use of [[DNA microarrays]] in conjunction with CGH techniques, the more specific form of array CGH (aCGH) has been developed, allowing for a locus-by-locus measure of CNV with increased resolution as low as 100 [[kilobase]]s.&lt;ref name="Pinkel,Albertson"&gt;Pinkel D, Albertson DG (2005) Comparative genomic hybridization. Annu Rev Genom Hum Genet 6:331–354.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deRavel,Devriendt,Fryns,Vermeesch"&gt;de Ravel TJ, Devriendt K, Fryns J-P, Vermeesch JR (2007) What's new in karyotyping? The move towards array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). European Journal of Pediatrics 166:637–643.&lt;/ref&gt; This improved technique allows for the aetiology of known and unknown conditions to be discovered.

==History==
The motivation underlying the development of CGH stemmed from the fact that the available forms of cytogenetic analysis at the time ([[giemsa banding]] and [[fluorescence in situ hybridization|FISH]]) were limited in their potential resolution by the microscopes necessary for interpretation of the results they provided. Furthermore, [[giemsa banding]]  interpretation has the potential to be ambiguous and therefore has lowered reliability, and both techniques require high labour inputs which limits the [[locus (genetics)|loci]] which may be examined.&lt;ref name="Pinkel,Albertson" /&gt;

The first report of CGH analysis was by Kallioniemi and colleagues in 1992 at the University of California, San Francisco, who utilised CGH in the analysis of solid tumors. They achieved this by the direct application of the technique to both breast cancer cell lines and [[Bladder cancer|primary bladder tumors]] in order to establish complete copy number [[karyotypes]] for the cells. They were able to identify 16 different regions of amplification, many of which were novel discoveries.&lt;ref name="Kallioniemi,Kallioniemi,Sudar,Rutovitz,Gray,Waldman,Pinkel" /&gt;

Soon after in 1993, du Manoir et al. reported virtually the same methodology. The authors painted a series of individual human chromosomes from a [[Library (biology)|DNA library]] with two different fluorophores in different proportions to test the technique,  and also applied CGH to genomic [[DNA]] from patients affected with either [[Downs syndrome]] or [[T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia]] as well as cells of a renal papillary carcinoma cell line. It was concluded that the fluorescence ratios obtained were accurate and that differences between genomic DNA from different cell types were detectable, and therefore that CGH was a highly useful cytogenetic analysis tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = du Manoir S, Speicher MR, Joos S, Schröck E, Popp S, Döhner H, Kovacs G, Robert-Nicoud M, Lichter P, Cremer T | year = 1993 | title = Detection of complete and partial chromosome gains and losses by comparative genomic in situ hybridization | url = | journal = Human Genetics | volume = 90 | issue = 6| pages = 590–610 | doi=10.1007/bf00202476| pmid = 8444465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the widespread use of CGH technology was difficult, as protocols were not uniform and therefore inconsistencies arose, especially due to uncertainties in the interpretation of data.&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest" /&gt; However, in 1994 a review was published which described an easily understood protocol in detail&lt;ref&gt;Kallioniemi OP, Kallioniemi A, Piper J, Isola J, Waldman FM, Gray JW, Pinkel D (1994) Optimizing comparative genomic hybridization for analysis of DNA sequence copy number changes in solid tumors. Genes, Chromosomes and Cancer 10:231–243.&lt;/ref&gt; and the image analysis software was made available commercially, which allowed CGH to be utilised all around the world.&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest" /&gt;
As new techniques such as microdissection and [[degeneracy (biology)|degenerate]] [[oligonucleotide]] primed [[polymerase chain reaction]] (DOP-PCR) became available for the generation of DNA products, it was possible to apply the concept of CGH to smaller chromosomal abnormalities, and thus the resolution of CGH was improved.&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest" /&gt;

The implementation of array CGH, whereby [[DNA microarrays]] are used instead of the traditional metaphase chromosome preparation, was pioneered by Solinas-Tolodo et al. in 1997 using tumor cells&lt;ref&gt;Solinas‐Toldo S, Lampel S, Stilgenbauer S, Nickolenko J, Benner A, Döhner H, Cremer T, Lichter P (1997) Matrix‐based comparative genomic hybridization: biochips to screen for genomic imbalances. Genes, Chromosomes and Cancer 20:399–407.&lt;/ref&gt; and Pinkel et al. in 1998 by use of breast cancer cells.&lt;ref&gt;Pinkel D, Segraves R, Sudar D, Clark S, Poole I, Kowbel D, Collins C, Kuo W-L, Chen C, Zhai Y (1998) High resolution analysis of DNA copy number variation using comparative genomic hybridization to microarrays. Nature genetics 20:207–211.&lt;/ref&gt; This was made possible by the [[Human Genome Project]] which generated a library of cloned DNA fragments with known locations throughout the human [[genome]], with these fragments being used as [[hybridization probe|probes]] on the DNA microarray.&lt;ref name="Marquis-Nicholson,Aftimos,Hayes,George,Love"&gt;Marquis-Nicholson R, Aftimos S, Hayes I, George A, Love DR (2010) Array comparative genomic hybridization: a new tool in the diagnostic genetic armoury. NZ Med J 123:50–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Now probes of various origins such as cDNA, genomic PCR products and [[bacterial artificial chromosome]]s (BACs) can be used on DNA microarrays which may contain up to 2 million probes.&lt;ref name="Marquis-Nicholson,Aftimos,Hayes,George,Love" /&gt; Array CGH is automated, allows greater resolution (down to 100 kb) than traditional CGH as the probes are far smaller than metaphase preparations, requires smaller amounts of DNA, can be targeted to specific chromosomal regions if required and is ordered and therefore faster to analyse, making it far more adaptable to diagnostic uses.&lt;ref name="Marquis-Nicholson,Aftimos,Hayes,George,Love" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Inazawa J, Inoue J, Imoto I | year = 2004 | title = Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)‐arrays pave the way for identification of novel cancer‐related genes | url = | journal = Cancer Science | volume = 95 | issue = | pages = 559–563 | doi=10.1111/j.1349-7006.2004.tb02486.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic methods==

===Metaphase slide preparation===
The DNA on the slide is a reference sample, and is thus obtained from a karyotypically normal man or woman, though it is preferential to use female DNA as they possess two X chromosomes which contain far more genetic information than the male Y chromosome. Phytohaemagglutinin stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes are used. 1mL of heparinised blood is added to 10ml of culture medium and incubated for 72 hours at 37&amp;nbsp;°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Colchicine is added to arrest the cells in mitosis, the cells are then harvested and treated with hypotonic [[potassium chloride]] and fixed in 3:1 [[methanol]]/[[acetic acid]].&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest" /&gt;

One drop of the cell suspension should then be dropped onto an ethanol cleaned slide from a distance of about 30&amp;nbsp;cm, optimally this should be carried out at room temperature at humidity levels of 60–70%. Slides should be evaluated by visualisation using a phase contrast microscope, minimal cytoplasm should be observed and chromosomes should not be overlapping and be 400–550 bands long with no separated [[chromatids]] and finally should appear dark rather than shiny. Slides then need to be air dried overnight at room temperature, and any further storage should be in groups of four at −20&amp;nbsp;°C with either [[Silicon dioxide|silica]] beads or [[nitrogen]] present to maintain dryness. Different donors should be tested as hybridization may be variable. Commercially available slides may be used, but should always be tested first.&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest" /&gt;

===Isolation of DNA from test tissue and reference tissue===

Standard [[phenol extraction]] is used to obtain DNA from test or reference (karyotypically normal individual) tissue, which involves the combination of [[Tris]]-[[Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid]] and [[phenol]] with [[aqueous solution|aqueous]]  DNA in equal amounts. This is followed by separation by agitation and centrifugation, after which the [[aqueous solution|aqueous]] layer is removed and further treated using [[ether]] and finally [[ethanol precipitation]] is used to concentrate the DNA.&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest" /&gt;

May be completed using DNA isolation kits available commercially which are based on [[Affinity chromatography|affinity columns]].&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest" /&gt;

Preferentially, DNA should be extracted from fresh or frozen tissue as this will be of the highest quality, though it is now possible to use archival material which is formalin fixed or paraffin wax embedded, provided the appropriate procedures are followed. 0.5-1&amp;nbsp;µg of DNA is sufficient for the CGH experiment, though if the desired amount is not obtained DOP-PCR may be applied to amplify the DNA, however it in this case it is important to apply DOP-PCR to both the test and reference DNA samples to improve reliability.&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest" /&gt;

===DNA labelling===

[[Nick translation]] is used to label the DNA and involves cutting DNA and substituting nucleotides labelled with fluorophores (direct labelling) or biotin or oxigenin to have fluophore conjugated [[Antibody|antibodies]] added later (indirect labelling). It is then important to check fragment lengths of both test and reference DNA by [[gel electrophoresis]], as they should be within the range of 500kb-1500kb for optimum hybridization.&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest" /&gt;

===Blocking===
Unlabelled Life Technologies Corporation's Cot-1 DNA® (placental DNA enriched with repetitive sequences of length 50bp-100bp)is added to block normal repetitive DNA sequences, particularly at [[centromeres]] and [[telomeres]], as these sequences, if detected, may reduce the fluorescence ratio and cause gains or losses to escape detection.&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest" /&gt;

===Hybridization===
8–12µl of each of labelled test and labelled reference DNA are mixed and 40&amp;nbsp;µg Cot-1 DNA® is added, then precipitated and subsequently dissolved in 6µl of hybridization mix, which contains 50% formamide to decrease DNA melting temperature and 10% dextran sulphate to increase the effective probe concentration in a saline sodium citrate (SSC) solution at a pH of 7.0.&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest" /&gt;

[[Denaturation (biochemistry)|Denaturation]] of the slide and probes are carried out separately.  The slide is submerged in 70% formamide/2xSSC for 5–10 minutes at 72&amp;nbsp;°C, while the probes are denatured by immersion in a water bath of 80&amp;nbsp;°C for 10 minutes and are immediately added to the metaphase slide preparation. This reaction is then covered with a coverslip and left for two to four days in a humid chamber at 40&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest" /&gt;

The coverslip is then removed and 5 minute washes are applied, three using 2xSSC at room temperature, one at 45&amp;nbsp;°C with 0.1xSSC and one using TNT at room temperature. The reaction is then preincubated for 10 minutes then followed by a 60-minute, 37&amp;nbsp;°C incubation, three more 5 minute washes with TNT then one with 2xSSC at room temperature.  The slide is then dried using an ethanol series of 70%/96%/100% before counterstaining with DAPI (0.35 μg/ml), for chromosome identification, and sealing with a coverslip.&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest" /&gt;

===Fluorescence visualisation and imaging===
A [[fluorescence microscope]] with the appropriate filters for the [[DAPI]] stain as well as the two fluorophores utilised is required for visualisation, and these filters should also minimise the crosstalk between the fluorophores, such as narrow band pass filters. The microscope must provide uniform illumination without [[Diatonic and chromatic|chromatic]] variation, be appropriately aligned and have a “plan” type of objective which is [[apochromat]]ic and give a magnification of x63 or x100.&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest" /&gt;

The image should be recorded using a camera with spatial resolution at least 0.1&amp;nbsp;µm at the specimen level and give an image of at least 600x600 pixels. The camera must also be able to integrate the image for at least 5 to 10 seconds, with a minimum photometric resolution of 8 bit.&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest" /&gt;

Dedicated CGH software is commercially available for the image processing step, and is required to subtract background noise, remove and segment materials not of chromosomal origin, [[Normalization (statistics)|normalize]]  the fluorescence ratio, carry out interactive karyotyping and chromosome scaling to standard length. A “relative copy number karyotype” which presents chromosomal areas of deletions or amplifications is generated by averaging the ratios of a number of high quality metaphases and plotting them along an ideogram, a diagram identifying chromosomes based on banding patterns. Interpretation of the ratio profiles is conducted either using fixed or statistical thresholds ([[confidence intervals]]). When using confidence intervals, gains or losses are identified when 95% of the fluorescence ratio does not contain 1.0.&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest" /&gt;

=== Extra notes ===
Extreme care must be taken to avoid contamination of any step involving DNA, especially with the test DNA as contamination of the sample with normal DNA will skew results closer to 1.0, thus abnormalities may go undetected. FISH, [[PCR]]  and [[flow cytometry]] experiments may be employed to confirm results.&lt;ref name="Pinkel,Albertson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Evangelidou,Alexandrou,Moutafi,Ioannides,Antonios,Koumbaris,Kallikas,Velissariou,Sismani,Patsalis"&gt;Evangelidou P, Alexandrou A, Moutafi M, Ioannides M, Antoniou P, Koumbaris G, Kallikas I, Velissariou V, Sismani C, Patsalis PC (2013) Implementation of High Resolution Whole Genome Array CGH in the Prenatal Clinical Setting: Advantages, Challenges, and Review of the Literature. BioMed Research International 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Array comparative genomic hybridization==
{{anchor|Array-CGH}}
Array comparative genomic hybridization (also microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization, matrix CGH, array CGH, aCGH) is a molecular [[cytogenetic]] technique for the detection of chromosomal [[Copy-number variation|copy number changes]] on a genome wide and high-resolution scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pinkel D, Albertson DG | year = 2005 | title = Array comparative genomic hybridization and its applications in cancer | url = | journal = Nat Genet | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 11–17 | doi=10.1038/ng1569}}&lt;/ref&gt; Array CGH compares the patient's genome against a reference genome and identifies differences between the two genomes, and hence locates regions of [[genetic imbalance|genomic imbalances]] in the patient, utilizing the same principles of competitive fluorescence in situ hybridization as traditional CGH.

With the introduction of array CGH, the main limitation of conventional CGH, a low resolution, is overcome. In array CGH, the metaphase chromosomes are replaced by [[molecular cloning|cloned]] DNA fragments (+100–200 kb) of which the exact chromosomal location is known. This allows the detection of [[chromosome abnormality|aberrations]] in more detail and, moreover, makes it possible to map the changes directly onto the genomic sequence.&lt;ref name="Oostlander,Meijer,Ylstra"&gt;Oostlander AE, Meijer GA, Ylstra B (2004) Microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization and its applications in human genetics. Clin Genet 66:488–495.&lt;/ref&gt;

Array CGH has proven to be a specific, sensitive, fast and highthroughput technique, with considerable advantages compared to other methods used for the analysis of DNA copy number changes making it more amenable to diagnostic applications. Using this method, [[copy number]] changes at a level of 5–10 [[kilobase]]s of DNA sequences can be detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ren H, Francis W, Boys A, Chueh AC, Wong N, La P, Wong LH, Ryan J, Slater HR, Choo KH |title=BAC-based PCR fragment microarray: high-resolution detection of chromosomal deletion and duplication breakpoints |journal=Human Mutation |pmid=15832308 |doi=10.1002/humu.20164 |volume=25 |issue=5 |date=May 2005 |pages=476–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2006}}, even [[high-resolution CGH]] ([[HR-CGH]]) arrays are accurate to detect [[structural variation]]s (SV) at resolution of 200 bp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Urban AE, Korbel JO, Selzer R, Richmond T, Hacker A, Popescu GV, Cubells JF, Green R, Emanuel BS, Gerstein MB, Weissman SM, Snyder M |title=High-resolution mapping of DNA copy alterations in human chromosome 22 using high-density tiling oligonucleotide arrays |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |date=21 March 2006 |volume=103 |issue=12 |pages=4534–4539 |pmid=16537408 |pmc=1450206 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0511340103}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method allows one to identify new recurrent chromosome changes such as [[microdeletion]]s and duplications in human conditions such as [[cancer]] and [[birth defect]]s due to chromosome aberrations.

[[File:Array-CGH protocol.svg|right|thumb|Figure 2. Array-CGH protocol]]

===Methodology===

Array CGH is based on the same principle as conventional CGH. In both techniques, DNA from a reference (or control) sample and DNA from a test (or patient) sample are differentially labelled with two different fluorophores and used as [[hybridization probe|probes]]  that are cohybridized competitively onto [[nucleic acid]] targets. In conventional CGH, the target is a reference metaphase spread. In array CGH, these targets can be genomic fragments cloned in a variety of vectors (such as [[Bacterial artificial chromosome|BACs]] or [[plasmids]]), [[Complementary DNA|cDNAs]], or [[oligonucleotides]].&lt;ref name="Bejjani,Shaffer"&gt;Bejjani BA, Shaffer LG (2006) Applications of array-based comparative genomic hybridization to clinical diagnostics. J Mol Diagn 8:528–533.&lt;/ref&gt;

Figure 2.&lt;ref name="Oostlander,Meijer,Ylstra" /&gt; is a schematic overview of the array CGH technique. DNA from the sample to be tested is labeled with a red fluorophore ([[Cyanine]] 5) and a reference DNA sample is labeled with green fluorophore (Cyanine 3). Equal quantities of the two DNA samples are mixed and cohybridized to a DNA microarray of several thousand evenly spaced cloned DNA fragments or oligonucleotides, which have been spotted in triplicate on the array. After hybridization, digital imaging systems are used to capture and quantify the relative fluorescence intensities of each of the hybridized fluorophores.&lt;ref name="Bejjani,Shaffer" /&gt; The resulting ratio of the fluorescence intensities is proportional to the ratio of the copy numbers of DNA sequences in the test and reference genomes. If the intensities of the flurochromes are equal on one probe, this region of the patient's genome is interpreted as having equal quantity of DNA in the test and reference samples; if there is an altered Cy3:Cy5 ratio this indicates a loss or a gain of the patient DNA at that specific genomic region.&lt;ref&gt;Shinawi M, Cheung SW (2008) The array CGH and its clinical applications. Drug Discovery Today 13:760–769.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technological approaches to array CGH===

[[File:ACGH profile of the IMR32 neuroblastoma cell line.svg|right|thumb|ACGH profile of the IMR32 neuroblastoma cell line]]
Array CGH has been implemented using a wide variety of techniques. Therefore, some of the advantages and limitations of array CGH are dependent on the technique chosen.
The initial approaches used arrays produced from large insert genomic DNA clones, such as [[bacterial artificial chromosome|BACs]]. The use of BACs provides sufficient intense signals to detect single-copy changes and to locate aberration boundaries accurately. However, initial DNA yields of isolated BAC clones are low and DNA amplification techniques are necessary. These techniques include [[Covalent bond|ligation]]-mediated polymerase chain reaction (PCR), degenerate primer PCR using one or several sets of primers, and [[rolling circle amplification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fiegler H, Carr P, Douglas EJ, Burford DC, Hunt S, Scott CE, Smith J, Vetrie D, Gorman P, Tomlinson IP, Carter NP | year = 2003 | title = DNA microarrays for comparative genomic hybridization based on DOP-PCR amplification of BAC and PAC clones | url = | journal = Genes Chromosomes Cancer | volume = 36 | issue = 4| pages = 361–374 | doi=10.1002/gcc.10155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrays can also be constructed using cDNA. These arrays currently yield a high spatial resolution, but the number of cDNAs is limited by the genes that are encoded on the chromosomes, and their sensitivity is low due to cross-hybridization.&lt;ref name="Oostlander,Meijer,Ylstra" /&gt; This results in the inability to detect single copy changes on a genome wide scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pollack JR, Perou CM, Alizadeh AA, Eisen MB, Pergamenschikov A, Williams CF, Jeffrey SS, Botstein D, Brown PO | year = 1999 | title = Genome-wide analysis of DNA copy number changes using cDNA microarrays | doi = 10.1038/12640 | journal = Nat Genet | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 41–46 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest approach is spotting the arrays with short oligonucleotides. The amount of oligos is almost infinite, and the processing is rapid, cost-effective, and easy. Although oligonucleotides do not have the sensitivity to detect single copy changes, averaging of ratios from oligos that map next to each other on the chromosome can compensate for the reduced sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carvalho B, Ouwerkerk E, Meijer GA, Ylstra B | year = 2004 | title = High resolution microarray comparative genomic hybridization analysis using spotted oligonucleotides | url = | journal = J Clin Pathol | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 644–646 | doi=10.1136/jcp.2003.013029}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible to use arrays which have overlapping probes so that specific breakpoints may be uncovered.

===Design approaches===

There are two approaches to the design of microarrays for CGH applications: whole genome and targeted.

Whole genome arrays are designed to cover the entire human genome. They often include clones that provide an extensive coverage across the genome; and arrays that have contiguous coverage, within the limits of the genome. Whole-genome arrays have been constructed mostly for research applications and have proven their outstanding worth in gene discovery. They are also very valuable in screening the genome for DNA gains and losses at an unprecedented resolution.&lt;ref name="Bejjani,Shaffer" /&gt;

Targeted arrays are designed for a specific region(s) of the genome for the purpose of evaluating that targeted segment. It may be designed to study a specific chromosome or chromosomal segment or to identify and evaluate specific DNA dosage abnormalities in individuals with suspected microdeletion syndromes or subtelomeric rearrangements. The crucial goal of a targeted microarray in medical practice is to provide clinically useful results for diagnosis, genetic counseling, prognosis, and clinical management of unbalanced cytogenetic abnormalities.&lt;ref name="Bejjani,Shaffer" /&gt;

==Applications==

===Conventional===

Conventional CGH has been used mainly for the identification of chromosomal regions that are recurrently lost or gained in tumors, as well as for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss MM, Kuipers EJ, Meuwissen SG, van Diest PJ, Meijer GA (2003) Comparative genomic hybridization as a supportive tool in diagnostic pathology. J Clin Pathol 56:522–527.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach can also be used to study [[chromosomal aberrations]] in [[fetal]] and [[neonatal]] genomes. Furthermore, conventional CGH can be used in detecting chromosomal abnormalities and have been shown to be efficient in diagnosing complex abnormalities associated with human genetic disorders.&lt;ref name="Oostlander,Meijer,Ylstra" /&gt;

====In cancer research====
CGH data from several studies of the same tumor type show consistent patterns of non-random genetic aberrations.&lt;ref name="Forozan,Karhu,Kononen,Kallioniemi,Kallioniemi"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Forozan F, Karhu R, Kononen J, Kallioniemi A, Kallioniemi OP | year = 1997 | title = Genome screening by comparative genomic hybridization | url = | journal = Trends Genet | volume = 13 | issue = 10| pages = 405–409 | doi=10.1016/s0168-9525(97)01244-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these changes appear to be common to various kinds of malignant tumors, while others are more tumor specific. For example, gains of chromosomal regions lq, 3q and 8q, as well as losses of 8p, 13q, 16q and 17p, are common to a number of tumor types, such as breast, ovarian, prostate, renal and bladder cancer (Figure. 3). Other alterations, such as 12p and Xp gains in testicular cancer, 13q gain 9q loss in bladder cancer, 14q loss in renal cancer and Xp loss in ovarian cancer are more specific, and might reflect the unique selection forces operating during cancer development in different organs.&lt;ref name="Forozan,Karhu,Kononen,Kallioniemi,Kallioniemi" /&gt; Array CGH is also frequently used in research and diagnostics of B cell malignancies, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

====Chromosomal aberrations====
[[Cri du Chat]] (CdC) is a syndrome caused by a partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome 5.&lt;ref name="Levy,Dunn,Kern,Hirschhorn,Kardon"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Levy B, Dunn TM, Kern JH, Hirschhorn K, Kardon NB | year = 2002 | title = Delineation of the dup5q phenotype by molecular cytogenetic analysis in a patient with dup5q/del 5p (Cri du Chat) | url = | journal = Am J Med Genet | volume = 108 | issue = 3| pages = 192–197 | doi=10.1002/ajmg.10261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have shown that conventional CGH is suitable to detect the deletion, as well as more complex chromosomal alterations. For example, Levy et al. (2002) reported an infant with a cat-like cry, the hallmark of CdC, but having an indistinct karyotype. CGH analysis revealed a loss of chromosomal material from 5p15.3 confirming the diagnosis clinically. These results demonstrate that conventional CGH is a reliable technique in detecting structural aberrations and, in specific cases, may be more efficient in diagnosing complex abnormalities.&lt;ref name="Levy,Dunn,Kern,Hirschhorn,Kardon" /&gt;

===Array CGH===
Array CGH applications are mainly directed at detecting genomic abnormalities in cancer. However, array CGH is also suitable for the analysis of DNA copy number aberrations that cause human genetic disorders.&lt;ref name="Oostlander,Meijer,Ylstra" /&gt; That is, array CGH is employed to uncover deletions, amplifications, breakpoints and ploidy abnormalities. Earlier diagnosis is of benefit to the patient as they may undergo appropriate treatments and counseling to improve their prognosis.&lt;ref name="Marquis-Nicholson,Aftimos,Hayes,George,Love" /&gt;

====Genomic abnormalities in cancer====
Genetic alterations and rearrangements occur frequently in cancer and contribute to its pathogenesis. Detecting these aberrations by array CGH provides information on the locations of important cancer genes and can have clinical use in diagnosis, cancer classification and prognostification.&lt;ref name="Bejjani,Shaffer" /&gt; However, not all of the losses of genetic material are pathogenetic, since some DNA material is physiologically lost during the rearrangement of immunoglobulin subgenes. In a recent study, array CGH has been implemented to identify regions of chromosomal aberration ([[copy-number variation]]) in several mouse models of breast cancer, leading to identification of cooperating genes during myc-induced oncogenesis.&lt;ref name="aprelikova"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aprelikova O, Chen K, El Touny LH, Brignatz-Guittard C, Han J, Qiu T, Yang HH, Lee MP, Zhu M, Green JE | title = The epigenetic modifier JMJD6 is amplified in mammary tumors and cooperates with c-Myc to enhance cellular transformation, tumor progression, and metastasis | journal = Clin Epigenetics | volume = 8 | issue = 38 | date = Apr 2016 | doi = 10.1186/s13148-016-0205-6 | url = http://clinicalepigeneticsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13148-016-0205-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Array CGH may also be applied not only to the discovery of chromosomal abnormalities in cancer, but also to the monitoring of the progression of tumors. Differentiation between [[metastatic]] and mild lesions is also possible using FISH once the abnormalities have been identified by array CGH.&lt;ref name="deRavel,Devriendt,Fryns,Vermeesch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marquis-Nicholson,Aftimos,Hayes,George,Love" /&gt;

====Submicroscopic aberrations====
[[Prader–Willi syndrome]] (PWS) is a paternal structural abnormality involving 15q11-13, while a maternal aberration in the same region causes Angelman syndrome (AS). In both syndromes, the majority of cases (75%) are the result of a 3–5 Mb deletion of the PWS/AS critical region.&lt;ref&gt;L'Hermine AC, Aboura A, Brisset S, Cuisset L, Castaigne V, Labrune P, Frydman R, Tachdjian G. (2003) Fetal phenotype of Prader–Willi syndrome due to maternal disomy for chromosome 15. Prenat Diagn 23:938–943.&lt;/ref&gt; These small aberrations cannot be detected using [[cytogenetics]] or conventional CGH, but can be readily detected using array CGH. As a proof of principle Vissers et al. (2003) constructed a genome wide array with a 1 Mb resolution to screen three patients with known, FISH-confirmed microdeletion syndromes, including one with PWS. In all three cases, the abnormalities, ranging from 1.5 to 2.9Mb, were readily identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vissers LE, de Vries BB, Osoegawa K, Janssen IM, Feuth T, Choy CO, Straatman H, van der Vliet W, Huys EH, van Rijk A, Smeets D, van Ravenswaaij-Arts CM, Knoers NV, van der Burgt I, de Jong PJ, Brunner HG, Geurts , van Kessel A, Schoenmakers EF, Veltman JA | year = 2003 | title = Array-based comparative genomic hybridization for the genome-wide detection of submicroscopic chromosomal abnormalities | url = | journal = Am J Hum Genet | volume = 73 | issue = | pages = 1261–1270 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, array CGH was demonstrated to be a specific and sensitive approach in detecting submicroscopic aberrations.

When using overlapping microarrays, it is also possible to uncover breakpoints involved in chromosomal aberrations.

====Prenatal genetic diagnosis====
Though not yet a widely employed technique, the use of array CGH as a tool for preimplantation genetic screening is becoming an increasingly popular concept. It has the potential to detect CNVs and [[aneuploidy]] in eggs, sperm or embryos which may contribute to failure of the embryo to successfully implant, miscarriage or conditions such as Down syndrome (trisomy 21). This makes array CGH a promising tool to reduce the incidence of life altering conditions and improve success rates of [[IVF]] attempts. The technique involves whole genome amplification from a single cell which is then used in the array CGH method. It may also be used in couples carrying [[chromosome translocations|chromosomal translocations]] such as balanced reciprocal translocations or Robertsonian translocations, which have the potential to cause chromosomal imbalances in their offspring.&lt;ref name="Evangelidou,Alexandrou,Moutafi,Ioannides,Antonios,Koumbaris,Kallikas,Velissariou,Sismani,Patsalis" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fiorentino F | year = 2012 | title = Array comparative genomic hybridization: its role in preimplantation genetic diagnosis | url = | journal = Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 203–209 | doi=10.1097/gco.0b013e328355854d}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee CN, Lin SY, Lin CH, Shih JC, Lin TH, Su YN | year = 2012 | title = Clinical utility of array comparative genomic hybridization for prenatal diagnosis: a cohort study of 3171 pregnancies | url = | journal = BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology | volume = 119 | issue = | pages = 614–625 | doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.2012.03279.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations of CGH and array CGH==
A main disadvantage of conventional CGH is its inability to detect structural chromosomal aberrations without [[copy number variant|copy number changes]], such as [[mosaic (genetics)|mosaicism]], balanced [[chromosomal translocations]], and [[chromosomal inversion|inversions]]. CGH can also only detect gains and losses relative to the ploidy level.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss MM, Hermsen MAJA, Meijer GA, van Grieken NCT, Baak JPA, Kuipers EJ, van Deist PJ (1999) Comparative genomic hybridization. J Clin Pathol: Mol Pathol 52:243–251.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, chromosomal regions with short repetitive DNA sequences are highly variable between individuals and can interfere with CGH analysis.&lt;ref name="Oostlander,Meijer,Ylstra" /&gt; Therefore, repetitive DNA regions like centromeres and telomeres need to be blocked with unlabeled repetitive DNA (e.g. Cot1 DNA) and/or can be omitted from screening.&lt;ref&gt;du Manoir S, Schrock E, Bentz M, Speicher MR, Joos S, Ried T, Lichter P, Cremer T (1995) Quantitative analysis of comparative genomic hybridization. Cytometry 19:27–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the resolution of conventional CGH is a major practical problem that limits its clinical applications. Although CGH has proven to be a useful and reliable technique in the research and diagnostics of both cancer and human genetic disorders, the applications involve only gross abnormalities. Because of the limited resolution of metaphase chromosomes, aberrations smaller than 5–10 Mb cannot be detected using conventional CGH.&lt;ref name="Forozan,Karhu,Kononen,Kallioniemi,Kallioniemi" /&gt;
For the detection of such abnormalities, a high-resolution technique is required.
Array CGH overcomes many of these limitations. Array CGH is characterized by a high resolution, its major advantage with respect to conventional CGH. The standard resolution varies between 1 and 5 Mb, but can be increased up to approximately 40 kb by supplementing the array with extra clones. However, as in conventional CGH, the main disadvantage of array CGH is its inability to detect aberrations that do not result in copy number changes and is limited in its ability to detect mosaicism.&lt;ref name="Oostlander,Meijer,Ylstra" /&gt; The level of mosaicism that can be detected is dependent on the sensitivity and spatial resolution of the clones. At present, rearrangements present in approximately 50% of the cells is the detection limit. For the detection of such abnormalities, other techniques, such as SKY (Spectral karyotyping) or FISH have to still be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shaw CJ, Stankiewicz P, Bien-Willner G, Bello SC, Shaw CA, Carrera M, Perez Jurado L, Estivill X, Lupski JR | year = 2004 | title = Small marker chromosomes in two patients with segmental aneusomy for proximal 17p | url = | journal = Hum Genet | volume = 115 | issue = 1| pages = 1–7 | pmid = 15098121 | doi = 10.1007/s00439-004-1119-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14426">'''Comparative physiology''' is a [[List of academic disciplines|subdiscipline]] of [[physiology]] that studies and exploits the diversity of functional characteristics of various kinds of [[organisms]].  It is closely related to [[evolutionary physiology]] and [[environmental physiology]].  Many universities offer undergraduate courses that cover comparative aspects of animal physiology. According to [[Clifford Ladd Prosser]], "Comparative Physiology
is not so much a defined discipline as a viewpoint, a philosophy."&lt;ref name="Prosser1975"/&gt;

==History==
Originally, [[physiology]] focused primarily on human beings, in large part from a desire to improve [[medical]] practices.  When physiologists first began comparing different [[species]] it was sometimes out of simple curiosity to understand how organisms work but also stemmed from a desire to discover basic physiological principles.  This use of specific organisms convenient to study specific questions is known as the [[Krogh Principle]].

==Methodology==
C. Ladd Prosser,&lt;ref name='Greenbergetal1975'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greenberg|first=M. J. |author2=P. W. Hochachka |author3=C. P. Mangum |year=1975|title=Biographical data:  Clifford Ladd Prosser| url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology|issn=|volume=194|issue=1|pages=5–12|doi=10.1002/jez.1401940102|pmid=1104756}}&lt;/ref&gt; a founder of modern comparative physiology, outlined a broad agenda for comparative physiology in his 1950 edited volume (see summary and discussion in [[Theodore Garland, Jr.|Garland]] and Carter&lt;ref name="GarlandCarter1994"/&gt;):

1.  To describe how different kinds of animals meet their needs.
:This amounts to cataloging functional aspects of biological diversity, and has recently been criticized as "stamp collecting" with the suggestion that the field should move beyond that initial, exploratory phase.&lt;ref name='MangumHochachka1998'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mangum|first=C. P.|author2=P. W. Hochachka|year=1998|title=New directions in comparative physiology and biochemistry: mechanisms, adaptations, and evolution| url=|journal=Physiological Zoology|issn=|volume=71|issue=5|pages=471–484|doi=|pmid=9754524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2.  The use of physiological information to reconstruct	[[phylogenetic]] relationships of organisms.&lt;br /&gt;
:In principle physiological information could be used just as morphological information or [[DNA]] sequence is used to measure evolutionary divergence of organisms.  In practice, this has rarely been done, for at least four reasons:
:* physiology doesn't leave many [[fossil]] cues,
:* it can't be measured on [[museum]] specimens,
:* it is difficult to quantify as compared with morphology or DNA sequences, and
:* physiology is more likely to be adaptive than DNA, and so subject to parallel and [[convergent evolution]], which confuses phylogenetic reconstruction.

3.  To elucidate how physiology mediates interactions between organisms and their environments.
:This is essentially [[physiological ecology]] or ecological physiology.

4.  To identify "model systems" for studying particular physiological functions.
:Examples of this include using squid giant axons to understand general principles of nerve transmission, using rattlesnake tail shaker muscles for measurement of in vivo changes in metabolites (because the whole animal can be put in an NMR machine),&lt;ref name='Conley_Lindstedt_1996'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conley|first=K. E.|author2=S. L. Lindstedt|year=1996|title=Rattlesnake tail-shaking: minimal cost per twitch in striated muscle| url=|journal=Nature|issn=|volume=383|pmid=8779716|issue=6595|pages=71–73|doi=10.1038/383071a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the use of ectothermic poikilotherms to study effects of temperature on physiology.

5.  To use the "kind of animal" as an experimental variable.
: "While other branches of physiology use such variables as light, temperature, oxygen tension, and hormone balance, comparative physiology uses, in addition, species or animal type as a variable for each function." &lt;ref name='prosser1950'&gt;Prosser (1950, p. 1)&lt;/ref&gt;
: 25 years later, Prosser put things this way: "I like to think of it as that method in physiology which uses kind of organism as one experimental variable."&lt;ref name='Prosser1975'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prosser|first=C. L.|year=1975|title=Prospects for comparative physiology and biochemistry| url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology|issn=|volume=194|pmid=1194870|issue=1|pages=345–348|doi=10.1002/jez.1401940122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparative physiologists often study organisms that live in "extreme" [[Natural environment|environments]] (e.g., deserts) because they expect to find especially clear examples of evolutionary adaptation.&lt;ref name='GarlandCarter1994'&gt;{{cite journal|last= [[Theodore Garland, Jr.|Garland]] |first=T., Jr.|author2=P. A. Carter|year=1994|title=Evolutionary physiology| url=http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/GarlCa94.pdf|journal=Annual Review of Physiology|issn=|volume=56|issue=|pages=579–621|doi=10.1146/annurev.ph.56.030194.003051|pmid= 8010752}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One example is the study of water balance in desert-inhabiting mammals, which have been found to exhibit kidney specializations.&lt;ref name='Al-kahtani_et_al_2004'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Al-kahtani|first=M.A. |author2=C. Zuleta |author3=E. Caviedes-Vidal |author4=[[Theodore Garland, Jr|T. Garland, Jr.]] |year=2004|title=Kidney mass and relative medullary thickness of rodents in relation to habitat, body size, and phylogeny| url=http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/Al-kahtaniEA2004.pdf|journal=Physiological and Biochemical Zoology |issn=|volume=77|issue=3|pages=346–365|doi=10.1086/420941|pmid=15286910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, comparative physiologists have been attracted to "unusual" organisms, such as very large or small ones.  As an example, of the latter, [[hummingbirds]] have been studied.  As another example, [[giraffe]] have been studied because of their long necks and the expectation that this would lead to specializations related to the regulation of [[blood pressure]].  More generally, [[ectothermic]] [[vertebrates]] have been studied to determine how [[blood]] [[acid-base balance]] and [[pH]] change as [[body temperature]] changes.

==Funding==
In the United States, research in comparative physiology is funded by both the [[National Institutes of Health]] and the [[National Science Foundation]].

'''Comparative sociology''' involves comparison of the social processes between [[nation states]], or across different types of society (for example [[capitalism|capitalist]] and [[socialist]]). There are two main approaches to comparative sociology: some seek similarity across different countries and cultures whereas others seek variance.  For example, [[structural Marxists]] have attempted to use comparative methods to discover the general processes that underlie apparently different social orderings in different societies.  The danger of this approach is that the different social contexts are overlooked in the search for supposed universal structures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/910157494|title=A dictionary of sociology|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Scott, John, 1949-|isbn=9780191763052|edition= Fourth|location=Oxford|oclc=910157494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One sociologist who employed comparative methods to understand variance was [[Max Weber]], whose studies attempted to show how differences between cultures explained the different social orderings that had emerged (see for example ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' and [[Sociology of religion]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There is some debate within sociology regarding whether the label of 'comparative' is suitable. [[Emile Durkheim]] argued in ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]'' (1895) that all sociological research was in fact comparative since social phenomenon are always held to be typical, representative or unique, all of which imply some sort of comparison. In this sense, all sociological analysis is comparative and it has been suggested that what is normally referred to as comparative research, may be more appropriately called [[cross-national research]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Antarctic expedition map (Amundsen - Scott)-en-crop.png|thumb|300px|alt= Map of a segment of Antarctica, identifying the polar marches of Scott and Amundsen.|The routes to the South Pole taken by Scott (green) and Amundsen (red), 1911–1912.]]

Between December 1911 and January 1912, both [[Roald Amundsen]] (leading his [[Amundsen's South Pole expedition|South Pole expedition]]) and [[Robert Falcon Scott]] (leading the [[Terra Nova Expedition]]) reached the [[South Pole]] within a month of each other. But while Scott and his four companions died on the return journey, Amundsen's party managed to reach the [[geographic south pole]] first and subsequently return to their base camp at [[Framheim]] without loss of life, suggesting that they were better prepared for the expedition. The contrasting fates of the two teams seeking the same prize at the same time invites comparison.

== Overview ==
The outcomes of the two expeditions were as follows.
*Priority at the South Pole: Amundsen beat Scott to the South Pole by 34 days.
*Fatalities: Scott lost five men including himself returning from the pole, out of a team of 65. Amundsen's entire team of 19 returned to Norway safely.
*Some authors (including Huntford and Fiennes) associate up to two further deaths (the drowning of Robert Brissenden and the suicide of [[Hjalmar Johansen]]) with the two expeditions, but these happened outside the Antarctic Circle.

Historically, several factors have been discussed and many contributing factors claimed,&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; including:

* Priority at the pole: Scott wrote that Amundsen's dogs seriously threatened his own polar aspirations, because dogs, being more cold-tolerant than ponies, would be able to start earlier in the season than Scott's mixed transport of dogs, ponies, and motors.&lt;ref&gt;Scott's diary, 22 Feb 1911 "The proper, as well as wiser, course for us is to proceed exactly as though this had not happened. To go forward and do our best for the honour of the country without fear or panic. There is no doubt that Amundsen's plan is a serious menace to ours. He has a shorter distance to the Pole by 60 miles— I never thought he could have got so many dogs safely to the ice. His plan for running them seems excellent. But above all he can start his journey early in the season—an impossible condition with ponies."&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cherry Garrard in ''[[The Worst Journey in the World]]'' agreed but added that in his experience, dogs would not have been able to ascend the Beardmore Glacier.&lt;ref&gt;Apsley Cherry Garrard, ''The Worst Journey in the World'', chapter 19 "The practical man of the world has plenty of criticism of the way things were done. He says dogs should have been taken [to the Polar Plateau], but he does not show how they could have been got up and down the Beardmore [Glacier]."&lt;/ref&gt;
* With regards to the causes of the deaths of Scott and his companions, Cherry-Garrard devotes chapter 19 in his book to examine the causes. Among several other factors, he surmised that [[#Food and fuel|the rations of Scott's team were inadequate]] and did not provide enough energy for the men.&lt;ref name="Apsley Cherry Gerrard 1921, page 573"&gt;Apsley Cherry-Garrard, The Worst Journey in the World&amp;nbsp;– Antarctic 1910–13, Chapter XIX, page 573.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Much of Scott's hauling was to be done by ponies, which are ill-suited to work on snow and ice without snow-shoes. Their relatively small hooves and large weight caused them to sink into anything other than very firm snow or ice. Oates was opposed to snow-shoes and had left most of them at base camp.
* Ponies' coats easily became soaked with [[perspiration]] during exertion, thus necessitating constant attention with blankets to avoid hypothermia through evaporation. Dogs in contrast do not have sweat glands—they cool themselves via panting, making them less vulnerable to the cold. With ponies, Scott acknowledged he could not depart until 1 November 1911 when the weather would be warmer, leaving him less time to complete the journey.
* The loss of ponies, several of which had drowned on disintegrating sea-ice, limited the supplies that could be hauled to the depots. Of 19 ponies brought south to aid in laying depots on the Ross Ice Shelf (traversed during the first and final quarters of the trek) nine were lost before the journey began. Further, unlike dogs which could eat the abundant [[Seal meat|seal]] and penguin meat found in Antarctica, the ponies' food had to be carried forward from the ship, vastly increasing the stores that had to be transported as Scott's expedition moved towards the pole.  
* Had the one-ton depot been placed at latitude 80°&amp;nbsp;S., as planned, Scott and his two surviving companions could have reached it on their return march. Instead, because Scott refused to drive the ponies to their deaths, despite Oates' urgent advice to do so, the depot was placed some 31&amp;nbsp;miles short of there. Scott's party died  11&amp;nbsp;miles south of the depot.
* The last-minute addition of Lieutenant Henry R. Bowers to the planned four-man pole party may have strained the rationing plan, although the death of Petty Officer Evans weeks later reduced the party to four again.
* The rations were deficient in B and C vitamins.&lt;ref name=Preston&gt;{{cite book|last= Preston|first= Diana|title= A First Rate Tragedy|publisher= Constable &amp; Co.|location= London|year= 1997|pages= 218–219|isbn= 0-09-479530-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party became weaker a few weeks after reaching the pole, despite Scott's racing ambitions before the return march, writing "Now for a desperate struggle to get the news through first [before Amundsen reaches the cablehead in Australia]. I wonder if we can do it."
* The tins of cooking fuel cached along the return route were found to be partly empty, which forced the men to eat frozen food. Shortage of fuel to melt water likely caused the men to become dehydrated. Apparently the heat of the sun had vaporised part of the fuel, enabling it to escape past the cork stoppers. Amundsen knew about this "creep", and had had the fuel tins soldered shut on the voyage to Antarctica, see below.
* The weather on the return march seems to have been unusually bad. In particular, when the party reached the Great Ice Barrier, the temperature was much lower than expected for the season, making the surface much less suitable for the sledge runners. Furthermore, the tailwind which they had expected to aid them home did not appear. Scott wrote, in his final "Message to the Public": "...our wreck is certainly due to this sudden advent of severe weather...."
* The complexity of the transportation plan made it vulnerable. It depended in part on motor-sledges, ponies, dogs, and southerly winds to assist the sledges (which were fitted with sails). Half of the distance was intended to be covered by man-hauling (and sails whenever conditions permitted). Scott's daily marches were limited to the endurance of the slowest team, the man-haulers who were instructed to advance 15 miles a day. The ponies marched by night and rested when the sun was warmer, Meares remained idle in camp with the much faster dogs for many hours, before catching up at the end of the day.&lt;ref&gt;E.G.R.G. Evans South With Scott. Collins London 1953 p184&lt;/ref&gt; 
Sullivan states that it was the last factor that probably was decisive.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; he states "Man is a poor [[pack animal|beast of burden]], as was shown in the terrible experience of Scott, Shackleton, and Wilson in their thrust to the south of 1902–3. However, Scott relied chiefly on man-hauling in 1911–12 because ponies could not ascend the glacier midway to the Pole. The Norwegians correctly estimated that dog teams could go all the way. Furthermore, they used a simple plan, based on their native skill with skis and on dog-driving methods that were tried and true. In a similar fashion to the way the moon was reached by expending a succession of rocket stages and then casting each aside; the Norwegians used the same strategy, sacrificing the weaker animals along the journey to feed the other animals and the men themselves."&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt;

== Objectives of the expeditions ==
Scott and his financial backers saw the expedition as having a scientific basis, while also wishing to reach the pole. However, it was recognised by all involved that the South Pole was the primary objective ("The Southern Journey involves the most important object of the Expedition"&amp;nbsp;– Scott), and had priority in terms of resources, such as the best ponies and all the dogs and motor sledges as well as involvement of the vast majority of the expedition personnel. Scott and his team knew the expedition would be judged on his attainment of the pole ("The ... public will gauge the result of the scientific work of the expedition largely in accordance with the success or failure of the main object"&amp;nbsp;– Scott). He was prepared to make a second attempt the following year (1912–13) if this attempt failed and had Indian Army mules and additional dogs delivered in anticipation. In fact the mules were used by the team that discovered the dead bodies of Scott, [[Henry Robertson Bowers]], and [[Edward Adrian Wilson]] in November 1912, but proved even less useful than the ponies, according to [[Cherry-Garrard]].

Amundsen's expedition was planned to reach the South Pole. This was a plan he conceived in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;The South Pole, Roald Amundsen, {{ISBN|1-85065-469-7}}, Volume I, Chapter II, page 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Amundsen's expedition did conduct geographical work under [[Kristian Prestrud]] who conducted an expedition to [[King Edward VII Land]] while Amundsen was undertaking his attempt at the pole.

== Base camps ==
Amundsen camped on the [[Ross Ice Shelf]] at the [[Bay of Whales]] which is 60&amp;nbsp;miles (96&amp;nbsp;km) closer to the pole than Scott's camp (which was 350&amp;nbsp;miles west of Amundsen). Amundsen had deduced that, as the Trans-Antarctic Mountains ran northwest to southeast then if he were to meet a mountain range on his route then the time spent at the high altitude of the Antarctic plateau would be less than Scott's.&lt;ref&gt;The South Pole, Roald Amundsen, {{ISBN|1-85065-469-7}}, Volume I, Chapter II, page 47.&lt;/ref&gt;
Scott's base was at [[Cape Evans]] on [[Ross Island]], with access to the Trans-Antarctic mountain range to the west, and was a better base for geological exploration. He had based his previous expedition in the same area. However, he knew it to be poor as a route to the pole as he had to start before sea ice melted and had suffered delay in returning while waiting for the sea ice to freeze. They also had to make detours around Ross Island and its known crevassed areas which meant a longer journey. The crossing of the Ross Ice Shelf was an onerous task for the ponies. Scott had advanced considerable stores across the ice shelf the year before to allow the ponies to carry lighter loads over the early passage across the ice. Even so, he had to delay the departure of the ponies until 1 November rather than 24 October when the dogs and motor sledges set off.&lt;ref&gt;E.R.G.R, Evans South With Scott Collins London 1953 p153&lt;/ref&gt;
Consequently, the Motor Party spent 6 days at the Mount Hooper Depot waiting for Scott to arrive.&lt;ref&gt;E.R.G.R, Evans South With Scott Collins London 1953 p184&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods of transport ==
=== Motor sledges ===
The major comparison between Scott and Amundsen has focused on the choice of draft transport&amp;nbsp;—dog versus pony/man-hauling. In fact Scott took dogs, ponies and three "motor sledges". Scott spent nearly seven times the amount of money on his motor sledges than on the dogs and horses combined. They were therefore a vital part of the expedition. Unfortunately, Scott decided to leave behind the engineer, Lieutenant Commander [[Reginald William Skelton]]&lt;ref name="Capt Scott 1910"&gt;Letter to Capt Scott, R W Skelton, 7 April 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; who had created and trialled the motor sledges. This was due to the selection of Lieutenant [[Edward Evans, 1st Baron Mountevans|E.R.G.R. "Teddy" Evans]] as the expedition's second in command. As Evans was junior in rank to Skelton, he insisted that Skelton could not come on the expedition.&lt;ref name="Capt Scott 1910" /&gt; Scott agreed to this request and Skelton's experience and knowledge was lost.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to R W Skelton from Capt Scott, 21 March 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the original three motor sledges was a failure even before the expedition set out; the heavy sledge was lost through thin ice on unloading it from the ship. The two remaining motor sledges failed relatively early in the main expedition because of repeated faults. Skelton's experience might have been valuable in overcoming the failures.&lt;ref&gt;Scott's Last Expedition, entry 17 Oct 1911, page 335 as an example.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ponies vs dogs ===
Scott had used dogs on his first ([[Discovery Expedition|Discovery]]) expedition and felt they had failed. On that journey, Scott, Shackleton, and Wilson started with three sledges and 13 dogs. But on that expedition, the men had not properly understood how to travel on snow with the use of dogs. The party had skis but were too inexperienced to make good use of them.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; As a result, the dogs travelled so fast that the men could not keep up with them. The Discovery expedition had to increase their loads to slow the dogs down.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; Additionally, the dogs were fed Norwegian dried fish, which did not agree with them and soon they began to deteriorate.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; The whole team of dogs eventually died (and were eaten), and the men took over hauling the sleds.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt;

Scott's opinion was reinforced by Shackleton's experience on his [[Nimrod expedition]] that got to within {{convert|97.5|nmi|km mi}} of the pole. Shackleton used ponies. Scott planned to use ponies only to the base of the [[Beardmore Glacier]] (one-quarter of the total journey) and man-haul the rest of the journey. Scott's team had developed snow shoes for his ponies, and trials showed they could significantly increase daily progress. However, [[Lawrence Oates]], whom Scott had made responsible for the ponies, was reluctant to use the snow shoes and Scott failed to insist on their use.&lt;ref name="Solomon-2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Solomon|first1=Susan|title=The Coldest March: Scott`s Fatal Antarctic Expedition|date=2001|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0300089678|edition=Hardcover|url=https://www.amazon.com/Coldest-March-Scott-s-Antarctic-Expedition/dp/0300089678/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479764466&amp;sr=1-1|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|85}}

There was plenty of evidence that dogs could succeed in the achievements of [[William Speirs Bruce]] in his Arctic, Antarctic, and [[Scottish National Antarctic Expedition]], Amundsen in the ''[[Gjøa]]'' [[North West passage]] expedition, [[Fridtjof Nansen]]'s crossing of [[Greenland]], [[Robert Peary]]'s three attempts at the [[North Pole]], [[Eivind Astrup]]'s work supporting Peary, [[Frederick Cook]]'s discredited North Pole expedition, and [[Otto Sverdrup]]'s explorations of [[Ellesmere Island]]. Moreover, Scott ignored the direct advice he received (while attending trials of the motor sledges in Norway) from Nansen, the most famous explorer of the day, who told Scott to take "dogs, dogs and more dogs".&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Sir Clements Markham from Fridtjof Nansen, 4 April 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the events, the expert view in England had been that dogs were of dubious value as a means of Antarctic transport.&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Murray | first = Carl | date = October 2008 | title = The use and abuse of dogs on Scott's and Amundsen's South Pole expeditions | journal = The Polar Record | publisher = Cambridge University Press | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 303–311 | issn = 0032-2474 | doi=10.1017/s0032247408007493}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadly speaking, Scott saw two ways in which dogs may be used—they may be taken with the idea of bringing them all back safe and sound, or they may be treated as pawns in the game, from which the best value is to be got regardless of their lives.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; He stated that if, and only if, the comparison was made with a dog sledge journey which aimed to preserve the dogs' lives, 'I am inclined to state my belief that in the polar regions properly organised parties of men will perform as extended journeys as teams of dogs.'&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; On the other hand, if the lives of the dogs were to be sacrificed, then 'the dog-team is invested with a capacity for work which is beyond the emulation of men. To appreciate this is a matter of simple arithmetic'.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; But efficiency notwithstanding, he expressed "reluctance" to use dogs in this way: "One cannot calmly contemplate the murder of animals which possess such intelligence and individuality, which have frequently such endearing qualities, and which very possibly one has learnt to regard as friends and companions."&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt;

Amundsen, by contrast, took an entirely utilitarian approach.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; Amundsen planned from the start to have weaker animals killed to feed the other animals and the men themselves.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sullivan | first = Walter | year = 1962 | title = The South Pole Fifty Years After | url=http://arctic.journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/arctic/index.php/arctic/article/view/3571/3546|journal = Arctic | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 175–178 | doi=10.14430/arctic3571}}&lt;/ref&gt; He expressed the opinion that it was less cruel to feed and work dogs correctly before shooting them, than it would be to starve and overwork them to the point of collapse.&lt;ref name="Pugh"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pugh | first = L G | title = The Logistics of the Polar Journeys of Scott, Shackleton and Amundsen | date = January 1972 | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 65 | issue = 1 | pages = 42–47 | pmid = 4552519 | pmc=1644311 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amundsen and his team had similar affection for their dogs as those expressed above by the English, but they "also had agreed to shrink from nothing in order to achieve our goal".&lt;ref&gt;The South Pole, Roald Amundsen, {{ISBN|1-85065-469-7}}, Volume II, Chapter XI, page 62-63.&lt;/ref&gt; The British thought such a procedure was distasteful, though they were willing to eat their ponies.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt;

Amundsen had used the opportunity of learning from the [[Inuit]] while on his ''[[Gjøa]]'' [[North West passage]] expedition of 1905. He recruited experienced dog drivers. To make the most of the dogs he paced them and deliberately kept daily mileages shorter than he need have for 75 percent of the journey,&lt;ref&gt;Diary, Olav Bjaaland, entry 12 November 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; and his team spent up to 16 hours a day resting. His dogs could eat seals and penguins hunted in the [[Antarctic]] while Scott's pony fodder had to be brought all the way from England in their ship. It has been later shown that seal meat with the blubber attached is the ideal food for a sledge dog. Amundsen went with 52 dogs, and came back with 11.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt;

What Scott did not realise is a sledge dog, if it is to do the same work as a man, will require the same amount of food.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; Furthermore, when sledge dogs are given insufficient food they become difficult to handle.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; The advantage of the sledge dog is its greater mobility.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; Not only were the Norwegians accustomed to skiing, which enabled them to keep up with their dogs, but they also understood how to feed them and not overwork them.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt;

=== Walking vs skiing on snow ===
Scott took the Norwegian [[pilot (aeronautics)|pilot]] and [[skier]] [[Tryggve Gran]] to the [[Antarctic]] on the recommendation of Nansen to train his expedition to ski, but although a few of his party began to learn, he made no arrangements for compulsory training for the full party. Gran (possibly because he was Norwegian) was not included in the South Pole party, which could have made a difference. Gran was, one year later, the first to locate the deceased Scott and his remaining companions in their tent just some 18&amp;nbsp;km (11 miles) short of One Ton depot, that might have saved their lives had they reached it.

Scott would subsequently complain in his diary, while well into his journey and therefore too late to take any corrective action and after over 10 years since the Discovery expedition, that "Skis are the thing, and here are my tiresome fellow countrymen too prejudiced to have prepared themselves for the event".&lt;ref&gt;Scott's Last Expedition, entry 11 Dec 1911, page 388.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amundsen on his side recruited a team of well experienced skiers, all Norwegians who had skied from an early age. He also recruited a champion skier, [[Olav Bjaaland]], as the front runner. The Amundsen party gained weight on their return travel from the [[South Pole]].

== Weather conditions ==
Scott and Shackleton's experience in 1903 and 1907 gave them first-hand experience of average conditions in Antarctica. [[George Simpson (meteorologist)|Simpson]], Scott's meteorologist 1910–1912, charted the weather during their expedition, often taking two readings a day. On their return to the Ross Ice Shelf, Scott's group experienced prolonged low temperatures from 27 February until 10 March which have only been matched once in 15 years of current records.&lt;ref name="Solomon-2001" /&gt;{{RP|286}} The exceptional severity of the weather meant they failed to make the daily distances they needed to get to the next depot. This was a serious position as they were short of fuel and food. When Scott, Wilson, and Bowers died (Petty Officer [[Edgar Evans]] and [[Lawrence Oates]] had died earlier during the return from the South Pole) they were {{Convert|11|mi|order=flip}} short of One-Ton Depot, which was {{Convert|140|mi|order=flip}} from Corner Camp, where they would have been safe.

On the other hand, Cherry-Garrard had travelled nearly {{Convert|300|mi|4=-2|order=flip}} in the same area, during the same time period and same temperatures, using a dog team.&lt;ref name="Apsley Cherry-Garrard 1912, page 420–428"&gt;Apsley Cherry-Garrard, The Worst Journey in the World&amp;nbsp;– Antarctic 1910–13, Chapter XIII, dates 19 Feb to 15 Mar 1912, page 420–428.&lt;/ref&gt; Scott also blamed "a prolonged blizzard". But while there is evidence to support the low temperatures, there is only evidence for a "normal" two- to four-day blizzard, and not the ten days that Scott claims.&lt;ref name="Solomon-2001" /&gt;{{RP|318-319}}

== Route marking and depot laying ==
During depot laying in February 1911, Roald Amundsen had his first (and last) {{Convert|180|mi|order=flip}} of his route marked like a Norwegian ski course using marker flags initially every eight miles. He added to this by using food containers painted black, resulting in a marker every mile. From 82 degrees on, Amundsen built a {{Convert|6|ft|abbr=on|adj=on}} cairn every three miles with a note inside recording the cairn's position, the distance to the next depot, and direction to the next cairn.&lt;ref&gt;The South Pole, Roald Amundsen, {{ISBN|1-85065-469-7}}, Volume II, Chapter X, page 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In order not to miss a depot considering the snow and great distances, Amundsen took precautions. Each depot laid out up to 85 degrees (laid out every degree of latitude) had a line of bamboo flags laid out transversely every half-mile for five miles on either side of the depot, ensuring that the returning party could locate the designated depot.

Scott relied on depots much less frequently laid out. For one distance where Amundsen laid seven depots, Scott laid only two. Routes were marked by the walls made at lunch and evening stops to protect the ponies. Depots had a single flag. As a result, Scott has much concern recorded in his diaries over route finding, and experienced close calls about finding depots.&lt;ref&gt;Scott's Last Expedition, entry 25 and 26 Jan 1912, page 431 and entry 12 and 13 Feb 1912, page 443 as examples.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also clear that Scott's team did not travel on several days, because the swirling snow hid their three-month-old outward tracks. With better depot and route marking they would have been able to travel on more days with a following wind which would have filled the sail attached to their sledge, and so travel further, and might have reached safety.

== Food and fuel ==
By the time they arrived at the pole, the health of Scott's team had significantly deteriorated, whereas Amundsen's team actually gained weight during the expedition. While Scott's team managed to maintain the scheduled pace for most of the return leg, and hence was virtually always on full rations, their condition continued to worsen rapidly. (The only delay occurred when they were held for four days by a blizzard, and had to open their summit rations early as a consequence.&lt;ref&gt;Scott's Last Expedition, entry 7 Dec 1911, page 381.&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[Apsley Cherry-Garrard]] in his analysis of the expedition estimated that even under optimistic assumptions the summit rations contained only a little more than half the calories actually required for the man-hauling of sledges.&lt;ref name="Apsley Cherry Gerrard 1921, page 573" /&gt; A carefully planned 2006 re-enactment of both Amundsen's and Scott's travels, sponsored by the [[BBC]], confirmed Cherry-Garrard's theory. The British team had to abort their tour due to the severe weight loss of all members.&lt;ref&gt;Jasper Rees, Blizzard&amp;nbsp;– Race to the pole, BBC Books 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-563-49326-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The experts hinted that Scott's reports of unusually bad surfaces and weather conditions might in part have been due to their exhausted state which made them feel the sledge weights and the chill more severely.

Scott's calculations for the supply requirements were based on a number of expeditions, both by members of his team (e.g., [[Edward Adrian Wilson|Wilson]]'s trip with [[Apsley Cherry-Garrard|Cherry-Garrard]] and [[Henry Robertson Bowers|Bowers]] to the Emperor penguin colony which had each man on a different type of experimental ration), and by Shackleton. Apparently, Scott didn't take the strain of prolonged man-hauling at high altitudes sufficiently into account.

Since the rations contained no [[B vitamins|B]] and [[Vitamin C|C vitamins]], the only source of these vitamins during the trek was from the slaughter of ponies or dogs.  This made the men progressively malnourished, manifested most clearly in the form of [[scurvy]].&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;

Scott also had to fight with a shortage of fuel due to leakage from stored fuel cans which used leather washers. This was a phenomenon that had been noticed previously by other expeditions, but Scott took no measures to prevent it. Amundsen, in contrast, had learned the lesson and had his fuel cans soldered closed. A fuel depot he left on Betty's Knoll was found 50 years later still full.&lt;ref name="Huntford-1985"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huntford|first1=Roland|title=The Last Place on Earth|date=1985|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton Ltd|location=London|isbn=0340381019|edition=Hardcover|url=https://www.amazon.com/Last-Place-Earth-Roland-Huntford/dp/0340381019/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479764934&amp;sr=1-1|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|553}}

Dehydration may also have been a factor. Amundsen's team had plenty of fuel due to better planning and soldered fuel cans. Scott had a shortage of fuel and was unable to melt as much water as Amundsen. At the same time Scott's team were more physically active in man-hauling the sledges.

== Clothing and goggles ==
It has been said (by the present-day explorer [[Ranulph Fiennes]] amongst others) that Scott's team was appropriately dressed for man-hauling in their woolen and wind-proof clothing, and as Amundsen was skiing it was appropriate he wore furs. Skiing at the pace of a dog team is a strenuous activity. Yet Amundsen never complained about the clothing being too hot. That is because the furs are worn loosely so air circulates and sweat evaporates. Scott's team, on the other hand, made regular complaints about the cold.

Amundsen's team did initially have problems with their boots. However, the depot-laying trips of January and February 1911 and an abortive departure to the South Pole on 8 September 1911 allowed changes to be made before it was too late.

Scott's team suffered regularly from [[snow blindness]] and sometimes this affected over half the team at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;Apsley Cherry-Garrard, The Worst Journey in the World&amp;nbsp;– Antarctic 1910–13, Chapter X, entry for 10 Dec, page 367 as an example.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, there was no recorded case of snow blindness during the whole of Amundsen's expedition. On the return journey, Amundsen's team rested during the "day" (when the sun was in front of them) and travelled during the "night" (when the sun was behind them) to minimise the effects of snow blindness.

== Delay in meeting Scott's returning party ==
In 1921, [[Edward Evans, 1st Baron Mountevans|'Teddy' Evans]] wrote in his book ''South with Scott'' that Scott had left the following written orders at Cape Evans.{{sfn|Karen May 2012, ''Could Captain Scott have been saved? Revisiting Scott's last expedition'', Polar Record |p=1-19}}

{{quote
| About the first week of February I should like you to start your third journey to the South, the object being to hasten the return of the third Southern unit [the polar party] and give it a chance to catch the ship. The date of your departure must depend on news received from returning units, the extent of the depot of dog food you have been able to leave at One Ton Camp, the state of the dogs, etc&amp;nbsp;...It looks at present as though you should aim at meeting the returning party about March 1 in Latitude 82 or 82.30.{{sfn|Evans, E.R.G.R. 1949, ''South with Scott'', London: Collins |p=187-188}}}}

He did however place a lesser importance upon this journey than that of replenishing the food rations at One Ton Depot.

He continued his instructions in the next paragraph "You will of course understand that whilst the object of your third journey is important, that of the second is vital. At all hazards three X.S. units of provision must be got to One Ton Camp by the date named (19th January), and if the dogs are unable to perform this task, a man party must be organised."&lt;ref&gt;Evans, E.R.G.R. 1953 South With Scott London Collins p = 173&lt;/ref&gt; with that qualification he closed his notes regarding his instructions for the dogs.

Expedition member [[Apsley Cherry-Garrard]] did not mention Scott's order in his 1922 book ''The Worst Journey in the World''. However, in the 1948 preface to his book,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Gray |first = Richard | title = Scott of the Antarctic could have been saved if his orders had been followed, say scientists | date = 31 December 2012 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/antarctica/robert-falcon-scott/9770678/Scott-of-the-Antarctic-could-have-been-saved-if-his-orders-had-been-followed-say-scientists.html | work = The Telegraph | accessdate = 27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; he discusses Scott's order. Cherry-Garrard writes that he and [[Edward L. Atkinson|Edward Atkinson]] reached Cape Evans on 28 January. Scott had estimated Atkinson would reach camp by 13 January.{{sfn|Evans, E.R.G.R. 1949, ''South with Scott'', London: Collins |p=187-188}} Atkinson, now the senior officer discovered that the dog handler [[Cecil Meares]] had resigned from the expedition and that neither Meares nor anyone else had resupplied dog food to the depots. Cherry-Garrard also wrote "In my opinion he [Atkinson] would not have been fit to take out the dogs in the first week of February".

On 13 February, Atkinson set off on the first lap southwards to Hut Point with the dog assistant, Dimitri Gerov, and the dogs to avoid being cut off by disintegrating sea ice. Atkinson and Gerov were still at [[Hut Point]] when, on 19 February, [[Tom Crean (explorer)|Tom Crean]] arrived on foot from the Barrier and reported that Lt [[Edward Evans, 1st Baron Mountevans|Edward Evans]] was lying seriously ill in a tent some {{Convert|35|mi|order=flip|round=5}} to the south, and in urgent need of rescue.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Lashly, and Crean had formed the final Support Party which had left Scott on 3 January. Lashly had stayed on the Barrier to nurse Evans while Crean walked to Hut Point. Both were awarded Albert (lifesaving) medals&lt;/ref&gt;  Atkinson decided that this mission was his priority, and set out with the dogs to bring Evans back. This was achieved; the party was back at Hut Point on 22 February.

Atkinson sent a note back to the Cape Evans base camp requesting either the meteorologist Wright or Cherry-Garrard to take over the task of meeting Scott with the dogs. Chief meteorologist Simpson was unwilling to release Wright from his scientific work, and Atkinson therefore selected [[Apsley Cherry-Garrard]]. It was still not in Atkinson's mind that Cherry-Garrard's was a relief mission, and according to Cherry-Garrard's account, told him to "use his judgement" as to what to do in the event of not meeting the polar party by One Ton, and that Scott's orders were that the dogs must not be risked. Cherry-Garrard left with Gerov and the dogs on 26 February, carrying extra rations for the polar party to be added to the depot and 24 days' of dog food. They arrived at One Ton Depot on 4 March and did not proceed further south. Instead, he and Gerov, after waiting there for Scott for several days, apparently mostly in blizzard conditions (although no blizzard was recorded by Scott some 100 miles further south until 10 March), they returned to Hut Point on 16 March, in poor physical condition and without news of the polar party.

On the return journey from the pole, Scott reached the 82.30°S meeting point for the dog teams three days ahead of schedule, around 27 February 1912. Scott's diary for that day notes "We are naturally always discussing possibility of meeting dogs, where and when, etc. It is a critical position. We may find ourselves in safety at the next depot, but there is a horrid element of doubt." By 10 March it became clear that the dog teams were not coming: "The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed. Meares [the dog-driver] had a bad trip home I suppose. It's a miserable jumble."

Around 25 March, awaiting death in his tent at latitude 79.30°S, Scott speculated, in a farewell letter to his expedition treasurer [[Edgar Speyer|Sir Edgar Speyer]], that he had overshot the meeting point with the dog relief teams, writing "We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to have missed it, but lately I have felt that we have overshot our mark. No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we had lacked support." (Farewell letter to Sir Edgar Speyer, cited from Karen May 2012.){{sfn|Karen May 2012, ''Could Captain Scott have been saved? Revisiting Scott's last expedition'', Polar Record |p=1-19}}

== Other reasons for Scott's failure ==
; Geology samples
: Scott's team continued to haul over 14&amp;nbsp;kg (30&amp;nbsp;lb) of rock samples. This would appear to be a major handicap when pulling a sledge in a race against the weather and a shortage of food and fuel. Scott could have left the samples at one of the cairns along the way to be picked up later. However, Ranulph Fiennes has suggested that the extra weight would not have been a major handicap.&lt;ref&gt;Captain Scott, Ranulph Fiennes, {{ISBN|0-340-82697-5}}-page 249.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tryggve Gran]] on the other hand thought "they might have saved themselves the bother".&lt;ref&gt;Diary, Tryggve Gran, entry 23 Nov 1912, quoted Last Place on Earth, Roland Huntford, {{ISBN|0-340-38101-9}}, page 556.&lt;/ref&gt;
; Final five-man team
: Scott's planning, equipment and rations had been based on three sledge teams of four men ascending the Beardmore, with a team turning back every 10 days or so as rations required finally leaving one four-man team to attempt the pole. At the last moment when down to two teams (Scott's and Evans's) Scott decided to send a returning party of three, and take on five. This increased the cooking time for the team of five and affected the fuel supply.&lt;ref&gt;Scott's Last Expedition, entry 5 Jan 1912, page 414.&lt;/ref&gt; It also meant the Evans party of three had to try to split the ration pack (at a time when they were cold and tired and later when one member was suffering from scurvy) to leave an allowance for the fifth man in Scott's party. This also will have affected the seepage of fuel from cans which were opened and then re-closed and left for several weeks before Scott's team got to them. Moreover, for some unexplained reason Scott had ordered Evans's team to cache their skis a week before so Bowers (the fifth man) walked to the pole and back to the cached skis (360&amp;nbsp;miles) while the rest of Scott's team skied.
; Misuse of the dog team
: For no clear reason Scott took the dogs on 140&amp;nbsp;miles further than originally planned. This meant killing the ponies early (and starting man-hauling earlier) to feed the dogs for no obvious benefit to the overall expedition. Scott also gave conflicting and changing orders for their use to each returning party. It was only in late February 1912 that it was discovered that the final supplies needed by Scott's returning party had not been delivered to One Ton Depot. Cherry-Garrard was sent with these supplies on 25 February 1912 and he was relieved to discover that he had beaten Scott's team to the depot.&lt;ref name="Apsley Cherry-Garrard 1912, page 420–428" /&gt; He also found that promised supplies of dog food were not in place. Cherry-Garrard remained at the depot, within {{Convert|100|km|4=-1}} of Scott, 4–10 March 1912 when he could possibly have saved Scott, Wilson, Bowers, and Oates if the management of the dog team had been better.
; Navigation
: Amundsen used prepared navigation sheets that simplified the calculations for his team when they were tired and cold. Four out of his team of five were qualified navigators. Amundsen's expedition also used a [[sextant]] during the journey, which is a relatively light and simple piece of equipment. He also attended a symposium that reviewed how to fix position at high latitudes. Scott used a [[theodolite]] which is heavier and requires more mental arithmetic.&lt;ref name="Huntford-1985" /&gt;{{RP|482}} Scott also lacked navigators having only one per team. Scott dismissed Cherry-Garrard's request for navigational training and Wilson only attempted to learn how to read latitudes at the last moment.&lt;ref name="Huntford-1985" /&gt;{{RP|473, 538}}
; Camp routine
: Amundsen used canisters that left his sledges permanently lashed and loaded. Scott's team had to unload, and load and relash their sledge at every camp, no matter what the weather.

{{more citations needed|date=May 2015}}
A '''contraction''' is a shortened version of the written and spoken forms of a word, syllable, or word group, created by omission of internal letters and sounds.

In linguistic analysis, contractions should not be confused with [[crasis]], [[abbreviation]]s nor [[acronym]]s (including initialisms), with which they share some [[semantic]] and [[phonetic]] functions, though all three are connoted by the term "abbreviation" in loose parlance.&lt;ref name=harts&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Hart's Rules|New Hart's Rules]]: The handbook of style for writers and editors|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=0-19-861041-6|year=2005|author = Roberts R|display-authors=etal}} {{rp|p.167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contraction is also distinguished from [[clipping (morphology)|clipping]], where beginnings and endings are omitted.

The definition overlaps with the term [[portmanteau]] (a linguistic ''[[Blend word|blend]]''), but a distinction can be made between a portmanteau and a contraction by noting that contractions are formed from words that would otherwise appear together in sequence, such as ''do'' and ''not'', whereas a portmanteau word is formed by combining two or more existing words that all relate to a singular concept which the portmanteau describes.

== English ==
{{main|English auxiliaries and contractions}}

[[English language|English]] has a number of contractions, mostly involving the elision of a vowel (which is replaced by an [[apostrophe]] in writing), as in ''I'm'' for "I am", and sometimes other changes as well, as in ''won't'' for "will not" or ''ain't'' for "am not". These contractions are commonly used in speech and in informal writing, though tend to be avoided in more formal writing (with limited exceptions, such as the mandatory form of "o'clock").

The main contractions are listed in the following table (for more explanation see [[English auxiliaries and contractions]]).

|-
| you
| y'-
| informal, as in "Where are y'all at?"
|}

Some other simplified pronunciations of common word groups, which can often equally be described as cases of [[elision]], may also be considered (non-standard) contractions (not enshrined into the written standard language, but frequently expressed in written form anyway), such as ''wanna'' for ''want to'', ''gonna'' for ''going to'', ''y'all'' for ''you all'',  ''ya'll'' for ''ya all'' in the [[Southern United States]] and others common forms in colloquial speech.

In [[subject–auxiliary inversion]], the contracted negative forms behave as if they were auxiliaries themselves, changing place with the subject. For example, the interrogative form of ''He won't go'' is '''''Won't he''' go'', whereas the uncontracted equivalent is ''Will he not go?'', with ''not'' following the subject.

== Chinese ==

Contractions exist in [[Classical Chinese]], some of which are used in modern Chinese.

Contractions also appear in [[Cantonese]], for example, 乜嘢&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=%E4%B9%9C%E5%98%A2&amp;oldid=27284238|title=乜嘢|publisher=|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 咩.

== French ==

The [[French language]] has a variety of contractions, similar to English but mandatory, as in ''[[wiktionary:c'est la vie|C'est la vie]]'' ("That's life"), where ''c'est'' stands for ''ce'' + ''est'' ("that is"). The formation of these contractions is called [[Elision (French)|elision]].

In general, any monosyllabic word ending in ''[[e caduc]]'' (schwa) will contract if the following word begins with a vowel, ''h'' or ''y'' (as ''h'' is silent and absorbed by the sound of the succeeding vowel; ''y'' sounds like ''i''). In addition to ''ce'' → ''c'-'' (demonstrative pronoun "that"), these words are ''que'' → ''qu'-'' (conjunction, relative pronoun, or interrogative pronoun "that"), ''ne'' → ''n'-'' ("not"), ''se'' → ''s'-'' ("himself", "herself", "itself", "oneself" before a verb), ''je'' → ''j'-'' ("I"), ''me'' → ''m'-'' ("me" before a verb), ''te'' → ''t'- '' (informal singular "you" before a verb), ''le'' or ''la'' → ''l'-'' ("the"; or  "he/she", "it" before a verb or after an imperative verb and before the word ''y'' or ''en''), and ''de'' → ''d'-'' ("of"). Unlike with English contractions, however, these contractions are mandatory: one would never say (or write) ''*ce est'' or ''*que elle''.

''Moi'' ("myself") and ''toi'' (informal "yourself") mandatorily contract to ''m'-'' and ''t'-'' respectively after an imperative verb and before the word ''y'' or ''en''.

It is also mandatory to avoid the repetition of a sound when the conjunction ''si'' ("if") is followed by ''il'' ("he", "it") or ''ils'' ("they"), which begin with the same vowel sound ''i'': ''*si il'' → ''s'il'' ("if it", if he"); ''*si ils'' → ''s'ils'' ("if they").

Certain prepositions are also mandatorily merged with masculine and plural direct articles: ''au'' for ''à le'', ''aux'' for ''à les'', ''du'' for ''de le'', and ''des'' for ''de les''. However, the contraction of ''cela'' (demonstrative pronoun "that") to ''ça'' is optional and informal.

In informal speech, a personal pronoun may sometimes be contracted onto a following verb. For example, ''je ne sais pas'' ({{IPA-fr|ʒənəsɛpa|IPA}}, "I don't know") may be pronounced roughly ''chais pas'' ({{IPA-fr|ʃɛpa|IPA}}), with the ''ne'' being completely elided and the {{IPA-fr|ʒ|}} of ''je'' being mixed with the {{IPA-fr|s|}} of ''sais''.{{Original research inline|date=March 2010}}  It is also common in informal contexts to contract ''tu'' to ''t'-'' before a vowel, e.g., ''t'as mangé'' for ''tu as mangé''.

== Hebrew ==

In [[Modern Hebrew]], the prepositional prefixes -בְּ /bə-/ 'in' and -לְ /lə-/ 'to' contract with the definite article prefix -ה (/ha-/) to form the prefixes -ב /ba/ 'in the' and -ל /la/ 'to the'. In [[Modern Hebrew|colloquial Israeli Hebrew]], the preposition את (/ʔet/), which indicates a definite direct object, and the definite article prefix -ה (/ha-/) are often contracted to 'ת (/ta-/) when the former immediately precedes the latter.  Thus ראיתי את הכלב (/ʁaˈʔiti ʔet haˈkelev/, "I saw the dog") may become ראיתי ת'כלב (/ʁaˈʔiti taˈkelev/).

== Italian ==

In Italian, prepositions merge with direct articles in predictable ways. The prepositions ''a'', ''da'', ''di'', ''in'', ''su'', ''con'' and ''per'' combine with the various forms of the definite article, namely ''il'', ''lo'', ''la'', ''l','' ''i'', ''gli'', ''gl','' and ''le''.

* Contractions with a, da, di, in, and su are mandatory, but those with con and per are optional.
* Words in parentheses are no longer commonly used, but some still exist in common expressions such as ''colla voce''.
* Formerly, ''gl''' was used before words beginning with ''i'', however it is no longer in common use.

The words ''ci'' and ''è'' (form of ''essere'', to be) and the words ''vi'' and ''è'' are contracted into ''c'è'' and ''v'è'' (both meaning "there is").
* “''C'è'' / ''V'è'' un problema”&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; There is a problem

The words ''dove'' and any word that begins with ''e'' are contracted into one single, deleting the e of the principal word, dove (dov'). Equally ''come'' does be made so.
As well other words may be contracted the same these two, like ''quale'', and other ones, etcetera.

== Spanish ==

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] has two mandatory phonetic contractions between prepositions and articles: ''al'' (to the) for ''a el'', and ''del'' (of the) for ''de el'' (not to be confused with ''a él'', meaning ''to him'', and ''de él'', meaning ''his'' or, more literally, ''of him'').

Other contractions were common in writing until the 17th century, the most usual being ''de'' + personal and demonstrative pronouns: ''destas'' for ''de estas'' (of these, fem.), ''daquel'' for ''de aquel'' (of that, masc.), ''dél'' for ''de él'' (of him) etc.; and the feminine article before words beginning with ''a-'': ''l'alma'' for ''la alma'', now ''el alma'' (the soul). Several sets of demonstrative pronouns originated as contractions of ''aquí'' (here) + pronoun, or pronoun + ''otro/a'' (other): ''aqueste'', ''aqueso'', ''estotro'' etc. The modern ''aquel'' (that, masc.) is the only survivor of the first pattern; the personal pronouns ''nosotros'' (we) and ''vosotros'' (pl. you) are remnants of the second. In medieval texts unstressed words very often appear contracted: ''todol'' for ''todo el'' (all the, masc.), ''ques'' for ''que es'' (which is); etc. including with common words, like d'ome (d'home/d'homme) instead de ome (home/homme), and so on.

Though not strictly a contraction, a special form is used when combining con with mí, ti or sí which is written as ''conmigo'' for *''con mí'' (with me), ''contigo'' for *''con ti'' (with you sing.), ''consigo'' for *''con sí'' (with himself/herself/itself/themselves (themself).

Finally, one can hear {{clarify|reason=in which dialects?|date=January 2014}} ''pa''' for ''para'', deriving as ''pa'l'' for ''para el'', but these forms are only considered appropriate in informal speech.

== Portuguese ==

In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], contractions are common and much more numerous than those in Spanish. Several prepositions regularly contract with certain articles and pronouns. For instance, ''de'' (of) and ''por'' (by; formerly ''per'') combine with the definite articles ''o'' and ''a'' (masculine and feminine forms of "the" respectively), producing ''do'', ''da'' (of the), ''pelo'', ''pela'' (by the). The preposition ''de'' contracts with the pronouns ''ele'' and ''ela'' (he, she), producing ''dele'', ''dela'' (his, her). In addition, some verb forms contract with enclitic object pronouns: e.g., the verb ''amar'' (to love) combines with the pronoun ''a'' (her), giving ''amá-la'' (to love her).

Another contraction in portuguese which is similar to English ones is the combination of the pronoun ''da'' with words starting in ''a'', resulting in changing the first letter ''a'' for an apostrophe and joining both words. Examples: ''Estrela d'alva'' (A popular phrase to refer to [[Venus]] that means "Alb star", as a reference to its brightness) ; ''Caixa d'água'' (water tank).

== German ==

In informal, spoken [[German language|German]] [[prepositional phrase]]s, one can often merge the preposition and the [[article (grammar)|article]]; for example, ''von dem'' becomes ''vom'', ''zu dem'' becomes ''zum'', or ''an das'' becomes ''ans''. Some of these are so common that they are mandatory. In informal speech, ''aufm'' for ''auf dem'', ''unterm'' for ''unter dem'', etc. are also  used, but would be considered to be incorrect if written, except maybe in quoted direct speech, in appropriate context and style.

The pronoun ''es'' often contracts to ''{{'}}s'' (usually written with the apostrophe) in certain contexts. For example, the greeting ''Wie geht es?'' is usually encountered in the contracted form ''Wie geht's?''.

=== Local languages in German-speaking areas ===

[[Dialectology|Regional dialects]] of German, and various local languages which usually were already used long before today's [[Standard German]] was created, do use contractions usually more frequently than German, but varying widely between different local languages. The informally spoken German contractions are observed almost everywhere, most often accompanied by additional ones, such as ''in den'' becoming ''in'n'' (sometimes ''im'') or ''haben wir'' becoming ''hamwer'', ''hammor'', ''hemmer'', or ''hamma'' depending on local intonation preferences. [[Bavarian language|Bavarian German]] features several more contractions such as ''gesund sind wir'' becoming ''xund samma'' which are schematically applied to all word or combinations of similar sound. (One must remember, however, that German ''wir'' exists alongside Bavarian ''mir'', or ''mia'', with the same meaning.) The Munich-born footballer [[Franz Beckenbauer]] has as his catchphrase "Schau mer mal" ("Schauen wir einmal" - in English "let's have a look"). A book about his career had as its title the slightly longer version of the phrase, "Schau'n Mer Mal".

Such features are found in all central and southern language regions. A sample from Berlin: ''Sag einmal, Meister, kann man hier einmal hinein?'' is spoken as ''Samma, Meesta, kamma hier ma rin?''

Several [[West Central German]] dialects along the [[Rhine River]] have built contraction patterns involving long phrases and entire sentences. In speech, words are often concatenated, and frequently the process of [[liaison (French)|"liaison"]] is used. So, ''[Dat] kriegst Du nicht'' may become ''Kressenit'', or ''Lass mich gehen, habe ich gesagt'' may become ''Lomejon haschjesaat''.

Mostly, there are no binding [[orthography|orthographies]] for local dialects of German, hence writing is left to a great extent to authors and their publishers. Outside quotations, at least, they usually pay little attention to print more than the most commonly spoken contractions, so as not to  degrade their readability. The use of apostrophes to indicate omissions is a varying and considerably less frequent process than in English-language publications.

== Norwegian ==

The use of contractions is not allowed in any form of standard [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] spelling, however, it is fairly common to shorten or contract words in spoken language. Yet, the commonness varies from dialect to dialect and from sociolect to sociolect—it depends on the formality etc. of the setting. Some common, and quite drastic, contractions found in Norwegian speech are "jakke" for "jeg har ikke", meaning "I do not have" and "dække" for "det er ikke", meaning "there is not". The most frequently used of these contractions—usually consisting of two or three words contracted into one word, contain short, common and often [[Syllable|monosyllabic]] words like {{wt|nb|jeg}}, {{wt|nb|du}}, {{wt|nb|deg}}, {{wt|nb|det}}, {{wt|nb|har}} or {{wt|nb|ikke}}. The use of the apostrophe (') is much less common than in English, but is sometimes used in contractions to show where letters have been dropped.

In extreme cases, long, entire sentences may be written as one word. An example of this is "Det ordner seg av seg selv" in standard written [[Bokmål]], meaning "It will sort itself out" could become "dånesæsæsjæl" (note the letters [[Å]] and [[Æ]], and the word "sjæl", as an [[eye dialect]] spelling of {{wt|nb|selv}}). [[R-dropping]], being present in the example, is especially common in speech in many areas of Norway {{which|date=March 2018}}, but plays out in different ways, as does elision of word-final phonemes like {{IPA|/ə/}}.

Because of the many dialects of Norwegian and their widespread use it is often difficult to distinguish between non-standard writing of standard Norwegian and eye dialect spelling. It is almost universally true that these spellings try to convey the way each word is pronounced, but it is rare to see language written that does not adhere to at least some of the rules of the official [[Norwegian orthography|orthography]]. Reasons for this include words spelled unphonemically, ignorance of conventional spelling rules, or adaptation for better transcription of that dialect's phonemes.

== Latin ==

Latin contains several examples of contractions. One such case is preserved in the verb ''nolo'' (I am unwilling/do not want) which was formed by a contraction of ''non volo'' (''volo'' meaning “I want”). Similarly this is observed in the first person plural and third person plural forms (nolumus and nolunt respectively).

== Japanese ==

Some contractions in rapid speech include ～っす (''-ssu'') for です (''desu'') and すいません (''suimasen'') for すみません (''sumimasen''). では (''dewa'') is often contracted to じゃ (''ja''). In certain grammatical contexts the particle の (''no'') is contracted to simply ん (''n'').

When used after verbs ending in the conjunctive form ～て (''-te''), certain auxiliary verbs and their derivations are often abbreviated. Examples:

|}
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; this abbreviation is never used in the polite conjugation, to avoid the resultant ambiguity between an abbreviated ''ikimasu'' (go) and the verb ''kimasu'' (come).

The ending ～なければ (''-nakereba'') can be contracted to ～なきゃ (''-nakya'') when it is used to indicate obligation. It is often used without an auxiliary, e.g., 行かなきゃ（いけない） (''ikanakya (ikenai)'') "I have to go."

Other times, contractions are made to create new words or to give added or altered meaning:
* The word 何か (''nanika'') "something" is contracted to なんか (''nanka'') to make a colloquial word with a meaning along the lines of "sort of," but which can be used with almost no meaning. Its usage is as a filler word is similar to English "like."
* じゃない (''ja nai'') "is not" is contracted to じゃん (''jan'') which is used at the end of statements to show the speaker's belief or opinion, often when it is contrary to that of the listener, e.g., いいじゃん！ (''ii jan!'') "What, it's fine!"
* The commonly used particle-verb phrase という (''to iu'') is often contracted to ～って／～て／～っつー (''-tte/-te/-ttsū'') to give a more informal or noncommittal feeling.
* といえば (''to ieba''), the conditional form of という (''to iu'') mentioned above, is contracted to ～ってば (''-tte ba'') to show the speaker's annoyance at the listener's failure to listen to, remember, or heed what the speaker has said, e.g., もういいってば！ (''mō ii tte ba!''), “I already told you I don't want to talk about it anymore!”.
* The common words だ (''da'') and です (''desu'') are older contractions that originate from である (''de aru'') and でございます (''de gozaimasu''). These are fully integrated into the language now, and are not generally thought of as contractions; however in formal writing (e.g., literature, news articles, or technical/scientific writing), である (''de aru'') is used in place of だ (''da'').
* The [[Japanese pronouns|first-person singular pronoun]] 私 is pronounced わたくし (''watakushi'') in very formal speech, but commonly contracted to わたし(''watashi'') in less formal speech, and further clipped in specifically younger women's speech to あたし (''atashi'').

Various [[Japanese dialects|dialects of Japanese]] also use their own specific contractions which are often unintelligible to speakers of other dialects.

== Polish ==

In the [[Polish language]] pronouns have contracted forms which are more prevalent in their colloquial usage. Examples are ''go'' and ''mu''. The non-contracted forms are ''jego'' (unless it is used as a possessive pronoun) and ''jemu'', respectively. The [[clitic]] ''-ń'' which stands for ''niego'' (him) as in ''dlań'' (''dla niego'') is more common in literature.  The non-contracted forms are generally used as a means to accentuate.&lt;ref&gt;http://nkjp.pl/settings/papers/NKJP_ksiazka.pdf (p.82)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uyghur ==

[[Uyghur language|Uyghur]], a [[Turkic languages|Turkic language]] spoken in [[Central Asia]], includes some verbal suffixes that are actually contracted forms of [[compound verb]]s ([[serial verb construction|serial verbs]]). For instance, ''sëtip alidu'' (sell-manage, "manage to sell") is usually written and pronounced ''sëtivaldu'', with the two words forming a contraction and the [p] [[lenition|leniting]] into a [v] or [w].{{Original research inline|date=March 2010}}

== Filipino/Tagalog ==

In Filipino, most contractions need other words to be contracted correctly. Only words that end with vowels can make a contraction with words like "at" and "ay." In this chart, the "@" represents any vowel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30866">[[Cryptic crossword]]s often use [[abbreviation]]s to clue individual letters or short fragments of the overall solution. These include:

*Any conventional abbreviations found in a standard dictionary, such as:
**"current": &lt;small&gt;AC&lt;/small&gt; (for "alternating current"); less commonly, &lt;small&gt;DC&lt;/small&gt; (for "direct current"); or even &lt;small&gt;I&lt;/small&gt; (the symbol used in physics and electronics)
*[[Roman numerals]]: for example the word "six" in the clue might be used to indicate the letters &lt;small&gt;VI&lt;/small&gt;
*The name of a [[chemical element]] may be used to signify its symbol; e.g., [[tungsten]] for &lt;small&gt;W&lt;/small&gt;
*[[Country codes]]: "Switzerland" can indicate the letters &lt;small&gt;CH&lt;/small&gt;
*[[ICAO spelling alphabet]]: where Mike signifies &lt;small&gt;M&lt;/small&gt; and Romeo &lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt;
*Conventional abbreviations for US cities and states: for example, New York can indicate &lt;small&gt;NY&lt;/small&gt; and "California" &lt;small&gt;CA&lt;/small&gt; or &lt;small&gt;CAL&lt;/small&gt;.

The abbreviation is not always a short form of the word used in the clue. For example:

*"Knight" for &lt;small&gt;N&lt;/small&gt; (the symbol used in chess notation)

Taking this one stage further, the clue word can hint at the word or words to be abbreviated rather than giving the word itself. For example:

*"About" for &lt;small&gt;C&lt;/small&gt; or &lt;small&gt;CA&lt;/small&gt;, abbreviations of "circa", meaning "about". "About" can also be abbreviated to &lt;small&gt;RE&lt;/small&gt;, for "regarding".
*"Say" for &lt;small&gt;EG&lt;/small&gt;, used to mean "for example".

More obscure clue words of this variety include:

*"Model" for &lt;small&gt;T&lt;/small&gt;, referring to the [[Model T]].
*"Beginner" or synonyms such as "novice" or "student" for &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;, as in [[L-plate]].
*"Bend" for &lt;small&gt;S&lt;/small&gt; or &lt;small&gt;U&lt;/small&gt; (as in "S-bend" and "U-bend")
*"Books" for &lt;small&gt;OT&lt;/small&gt; or &lt;small&gt;NT&lt;/small&gt;, as in Old Testament or New Testament.
*"Sailor" for &lt;small&gt;AB&lt;/small&gt;, abbreviation of able-bodied.
*"Take" for &lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt;, abbreviation of the Latin word ''recipe'', meaning "take".

[[File:Latin dictionary.jpg|thumb|A multi-volume Latin dictionary by [[Egidio Forcellini]].]]
[[File:Woerterbuchstapel Langenscheidt.jpg|thumb|[[Langenscheidt]] dictionaries]]
A '''dictionary''', sometimes known as a '''wordbook''', is a collection of [[word]]s in one or more specific [[language]]s, often arranged [[Alphabetical order|alphabetically]] (or by [[radical-and-stroke sorting|radical and stroke]] for [[ideographic]] languages), which may include information on [[definition]]s, usage, [[etymologies]], [[pronunciation]]s, translation, etc.&lt;ref name = Web1&gt;Webster's New World College Dictionary, Fourth Edition, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; or a book of words in one language with their equivalents in another, sometimes known as a [[lexicon]].&lt;ref name = Web1/&gt; It is a [[Lexicography|lexicographical]] reference that shows inter-relationships among the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author = Nielsen, Sandro |year = 2008 |title = The Effect of Lexicographical Information Costs on Dictionary Naming and Use | url = | journal = Lexikos |volume = 18 |issn= 1684-4904 |pages = 170–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A broad distinction is made between general and [[specialized dictionaries]]. Specialized dictionaries include words in specialist fields, rather than a complete range of words in the language. Lexical items that describe concepts in specific fields are usually called terms instead of words, although there is no consensus whether [[lexicology]] and [[terminology]] are two different fields of study. In theory, general dictionaries are supposed{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} to be [[Semasiology|semasiological]], mapping word to [[definition]], while specialized dictionaries are supposed to be [[Onomasiology|onomasiological]], first identifying [[concept]]s and then establishing the terms used to designate them. In practice, the two approaches are used for both types.&lt;ref name="Sterkenburg2003"&gt;A Practical Guide to Lexicography, Sterkenburg 2003, pp. 155–157&lt;/ref&gt; There are other types of dictionaries that do not fit neatly into the above distinction, for instance [[bilingual dictionary|bilingual (translation) dictionaries]], dictionaries of [[synonym]]s ([[thesaurus|thesauri]]), and [[rhyming]] dictionaries. The word dictionary (unqualified) is usually understood to refer to a general purpose [[monolingual dictionary]].&lt;ref name=Sintro&gt;A Practical Guide to Lexicography, Sterkenburg 2003, pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a contrast between [[Prescription and description|''prescriptive'' or ''descriptive'']] dictionaries; the former reflect what is seen as correct use of the language while the latter reflect recorded actual use. Stylistic indications (e.g. "informal" or "vulgar") in many modern dictionaries are also considered by some to be less than objectively descriptive.&lt;ref&gt;A Practical Guide to Lexicography, Sterkenburg 2003, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the first recorded dictionaries date back to [[Sumer]]ian times (these were bilingual dictionaries), the systematic study of dictionaries as objects of scientific interest themselves is a 20th-century enterprise, called [[lexicography]], and largely initiated by [[Ladislav Zgusta]].&lt;ref name=Sintro/&gt; The birth of the new discipline was not without controversy, the practical dictionary-makers being sometimes accused by others of "astonishing" lack of method and critical-self reflection.&lt;ref name="Hartmann2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=R. R. K. Hartmann|title=Lexicography: Dictionaries, compilers, critics, and users|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hLlhyvpg7KoC&amp;pg=PA21|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-25366-6|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The oldest known dictionaries were [[Akkadian Empire]] cuneiform tablets with bilingual [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]–[[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] wordlists, discovered in [[Ebla]] (modern [[Syria]]) and dated roughly 2300 [[Common Era|BCE]].&lt;ref name="imlqdg"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Dictionary – MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761573731/Dictionary.html#p3 |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwbLyr75?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761573731/Dictionary.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The early 2nd millennium BCE ''[[Urra=hubullu]]'' glossary is the canonical [[Babylonia]]n version of such bilingual Sumerian wordlists. A [[Chinese dictionary]], the c. 3rd century BCE ''[[Erya]]'', was the earliest surviving monolingual dictionary; although some sources cite the c. 800 BCE [[Shizhoupian]] as a "dictionary", modern scholarship considers it a calligraphic compendium of [[Chinese character]]s from [[Zhou dynasty]] bronzes. [[Philitas of Cos]] (fl. 4th century BCE) wrote a pioneering vocabulary ''Disorderly Words'' (Ἄτακτοι γλῶσσαι, ''{{transl|el|ISO|Átaktoi glôssai}}'') which explained the meanings of rare [[Homer]]ic and other literary words, words from local dialects, and technical terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Peter Bing |title= The unruly tongue: Philitas of Cos as scholar and poet |journal= Classical Philology |volume=98 |issue=4 |year=2003 |pages=330–348 |doi=10.1086/422370}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apollonius the Sophist]] (fl. 1st century CE) wrote the oldest surviving Homeric lexicon.&lt;ref name = "imlqdg"/&gt; The first [[Sanskrit]] dictionary, the [[Amarakosha|Amarakośa]], was written by [[Amara Sinha]] c. 4th century CE. Written in verse, it listed around 10,000 words. According to the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'', the first [[Japanese dictionaries#Early Japanese lexicography|Japanese dictionary]] was the long-lost 682 CE ''Niina'' glossary of Chinese characters. The oldest existing Japanese dictionary, the c. 835 CE ''[[Tenrei Banshō Meigi]]'', was also a glossary of written Chinese. In ''[[Frahang-i Pahlavig]]'', [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] [[Heterogram (linguistics)|heterograms]] are listed together with their translation in [[Middle Persian]] language and phonetic transcription in [[Pazand]] alphabet. A 9th-century CE Irish dictionary, [[Sanas Cormaic]], contained etymologies and explanations of over 1,400 Irish words. In India around 1320, [[Amir Khusro]] compiled the Khaliq-e-bari which mainly dealt with [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rashid|first=Omar|title=Chasing Khusro|url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/books/article3672990.ece|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nouveau Dictionnaire Larousse page.JPG|thumb|The French-language ''[[Petit Larousse]]'' is an example of an illustrated dictionary.]]

[[Arabic]] dictionaries were compiled between the 8th and 14th centuries CE, organizing words in rhyme order (by the last syllable), by alphabetical order of the [[root (linguistics)|radicals]], or according to the alphabetical order of the first letter (the system used in modern European language dictionaries). The modern system was mainly used in specialist dictionaries, such as those of terms from the [[Qur'an]] and [[hadith]], while most general use dictionaries, such as the ''Lisan al-`Arab'' (13th century, still the best-known large-scale dictionary of Arabic) and ''al-Qamus al-Muhit'' (14th century) listed words in the alphabetical order of the radicals. The ''Qamus al-Muhit'' is the first handy dictionary in Arabic, which includes only words and their definitions, eliminating the supporting examples used in such dictionaries as the ''Lisan'' and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Ḳāmūs", J. Eckmann, ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', 2nd ed., Brill&lt;/ref&gt;

In medieval Europe, [[glossary|glossaries]] with equivalents for Latin words in [[vernacular]] or simpler Latin were in use (e.g. the [[Leiden Glossary]]). The ''[[Catholicon (1286)|Catholicon]]'' (1287) by [[John of Genoa|Johannes Balbus]], a large grammatical work with an alphabetical lexicon, was widely adopted. It served as the basis for several bilingual dictionaries and was one of the earliest books (in 1460) to be printed. In 1502 [[Ambrogio Calepino]]'s ''Dictionarium'' was published, originally a monolingual Latin dictionary, which over the course of the 16th century was enlarged to become a multilingual glossary. In 1532 [[Robert Estienne]] published the ''Thesaurus linguae latinae'' and in 1572 his son [[Henri Estienne]] published the ''[[Thesaurus linguae graecae]]'', which served up to the 19th century as the basis of Greek lexicography. The first monolingual dictionary written in Europe was the Spanish, written by [[Sebastián Covarrubias]]' ''[[Tesoro de la lengua castellana o española]]'', published in 1611 in Madrid, Spain.&lt;ref&gt;''Tesoro de la lengua castellana o española'', edición integral e ilustrada de Ignacio Arellano y Rafael Zafra, Madrid, Iberoamericana-Vervuert, 2006, pg. XLIX.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1612 the first edition of the ''[[Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca]]'', for [[italian language|Italian]], was published. It served as the model for similar works in French and English. In 1690 in [[Rotterdam]] was published, posthumously, the ''Dictionnaire Universel'' by [[Antoine Furetière]] for [[french language|French]]. In 1694 appeared the first edition of the ''[[Dictionnaire de l'Académie française]]''. Between 1712 and 1721 was published the ''Vocabulario portughez e latino'' written by Raphael Bluteau. The [[Real Academia Española]] published the first edition of the ''[[Diccionario de la lengua española]]'' in 1780, but their ''Diccionario de Autoridades'', which included quotes taken from literary works, was published in 1726. The ''Totius Latinitatis lexicon'' by [[Egidio Forcellini]] was firstly published in 1777; it has formed the basis of all similar works that have since been published.

The first edition of ''[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]'' by [[Henry George Liddell]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]] appeared in 1843; this work remained the basic dictionary of Greek until the end of the 20th century. And in 1858 was published the first volume of the [[Deutsches Wörterbuch]] by the [[Brothers Grimm]]; the work was completed in 1961. Between 1861 and 1874 was published the ''Dizionario della lingua italiana'' by [[Niccolò Tommaseo]]. Between 1862 and 1874 was published the six volumes of ''A magyar nyelv szótára'' (Dictionary of Hungarian Language) by Gergely Czuczor and János Fogarasi. [[Émile Littré]] published the [[Dictionnaire de la langue française (Littré)|Dictionnaire de la langue française]] between 1863 and 1872. In the same year 1863 appeared the first volume of the ''[[Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal]]'' which was completed in 1998. Also in 1863 [[Vladimir Ivanovich Dahl]] published the ''[[Explanatory Dictionary of the Living Great Russian Language]]''. The [[Duden]] dictionary dates back to 1880, and is currently the [[prescriptive]] source for the spelling of German. The decision to start work on the ''[[Svenska Akademiens ordbok]]'' was taken in 1787.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g3.spraakdata.gu.se/saob/|title=OSA – Om svar anhålles|website=g3.spraakdata.gu.se|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===English dictionaries in Britain===

The earliest dictionaries in the English language were glossaries of French, Spanish or Latin words along with their definitions in English. The word "dictionary" was invented by an Englishman called [[John of Garland]] in 1220 — he had written a book ''[[Dictionarius (Johannes de Garlandia)|Dictionarius]]'' to help with Latin "diction".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Forsyth. The etymologicon. // Icon Books Ltd. London N79DP, 2011. p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; An early non-alphabetical list of 8000 English words was the ''Elementarie'', created by [[Richard Mulcaster]] in 1582.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/dic/mul/elementarie.html|title=1582 - Mulcaster's Elementarie|website=www.bl.uk|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://angli02.kgw.tu-berlin.de/lexicography/b_history.html A Brief History of English Lexicography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309181613/http://angli02.kgw.tu-berlin.de/lexicography/b_history.html |date=2008-03-09 }}, Peter Erdmann and See-Young Cho, [[Technical University of Berlin|Technische Universität Berlin]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first purely English alphabetical dictionary was ''[[Table Alphabeticall|A Table Alphabeticall]]'', written by English schoolteacher [[Robert Cawdrey]] in 1604. The only surviving copy is found at the [[Bodleian Library]] in [[Oxford]]. This dictionary, and the many imitators which followed it, was seen as unreliable and nowhere near definitive. [[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield]] was still lamenting in 1754, 150 years after Cawdrey's publication, that it is "a sort of disgrace to our nation, that hitherto we have had no… standard of our language; our dictionaries at present being more properly what our neighbors the Dutch and the Germans call theirs, word-books, than dictionaries in the superior sense of that title." &lt;ref&gt;[http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Papers/firstdict.html Jack Lynch, “How Johnson's Dictionary Became the First Dictionary” (delivered 25 August 2005 at the Johnson and the English Language conference, Birmingham)] Retrieved July 12, 2008,&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1616, John Bullokar described the history of the dictionary with his "English Expositor". ''Glossographia'' by [[Thomas Blount (lexicographer)|Thomas Blount]], published in 1656, contains more than 10,000 words along with their etymologies or histories. [[Edward Phillips]] wrote another dictionary in 1658, entitled "[[The New World of English Words]]: Or a General Dictionary" which boldly [[Plagiarism|plagiarized]] Blount's work, and the two denounced {{clarify|date=November 2016}} each other. This created more interest in the dictionaries. [[John Wilkins]]' 1668 [[An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language|essay on philosophical language]] contains a list of 11,500 words with careful distinctions, compiled by [[William Lloyd (bishop of Worcester)|William Lloyd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John P. Considine|title=Dictionaries in Early Modern Europe: Lexicography and the Making of Heritage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cqBkQFiTbX4C&amp;pg=PA298|accessdate=16 May 2016|date=27 March 2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-88674-1|page=298}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elisha Coles]] published his "English Dictionary" in 1676.

It was not until [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (1755) that a more reliable English dictionary was produced. Many people today mistakenly believe that Johnson wrote the first English dictionary: a testimony to this legacy.&lt;ref name = "wblqfm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Papers/firstdict.html|title=Lynch, "How Johnson's Dictionary Became the First Dictionary"|website=andromeda.rutgers.edu|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this stage, dictionaries had evolved to contain textual references for most words, and were arranged alphabetically, rather than by topic (a previously popular form of arrangement, which meant all animals would be grouped together, etc.). Johnson's masterwork could be judged as the first to bring all these elements together, creating the first "modern" dictionary.&lt;ref name = "wblqfm"/&gt;

Johnson's dictionary remained the English-language standard for over 150 years, until the [[Oxford University Press]] began writing and releasing the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' in short [[wikt:fascicle|fascicles]] from 1884 onwards. It took nearly 50 years to complete this huge work, and they finally released the complete ''OED'' in twelve volumes in 1928. It remains the most comprehensive and trusted English language dictionary to this day, with revisions and updates added by a dedicated team every three months. One of the main contributors to this modern dictionary was an ex-army surgeon, [[William Chester Minor]], a convicted murderer who was confined to an asylum for the criminally insane.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Winchester]], ''[[The Surgeon of Crowthorne]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===American English dictionaries===
In 1806, American [[Noah Webster]] published his first dictionary, ''[[s:A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language|A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language]]''. In 1807 Webster began compiling an expanded and fully comprehensive dictionary, ''An American Dictionary of the English Language;'' it took twenty-seven years to complete. To evaluate the etymology of words, Webster learned twenty-six languages, including [[Old English]] (Anglo-Saxon), German, Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish, French, Hebrew, Arabic, and [[Sanskrit]].

Webster completed his dictionary during his year abroad in 1825 in Paris, France, and at the [[University of Cambridge]]. His book contained seventy thousand words, of which twelve thousand had never appeared in a published dictionary before. As a [[spelling reform]]er, Webster believed that English spelling rules were unnecessarily complex, so his dictionary introduced [[American English]] spellings, replacing "colour" with "color", substituting "wagon" for "waggon", and printing "center" instead of "centre". He also added American words, like "skunk" and "squash", that did not appear in British dictionaries. At the age of seventy, Webster published his dictionary in 1828; it sold 2500 copies. In 1840, the second edition was published in two volumes.

==Types==

In a general dictionary, each word may have multiple meanings. Some dictionaries include each separate meaning in the order of most common usage while others list definitions in historical order, with the oldest usage first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/ld/pubs/corereference/internal/chd.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425064041/http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/ld/pubs/corereference/internal/chd.html |archivedate=2010-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many languages, words can appear in many different forms, but only the [[lemma (morphology)|undeclined or unconjugated]] form appears as the [[headword]] in most dictionaries. Dictionaries are most commonly found in the form of a book, but some newer dictionaries, like [[StarDict]] and the ''[[New Oxford American Dictionary]]'' are dictionary software running on [[Personal Digital Assistant|PDAs]] or [[computer]]s. There are also many [[List of online dictionaries|online dictionaries]] accessible via the [[Internet]].

===Specialized dictionaries===
{{main|Specialized dictionary}}
According to the ''Manual of Specialized Lexicographies'', a [[specialized dictionary]], also referred to as a technical dictionary, is a dictionary that focuses upon a specific subject field. Following the description in ''The Bilingual LSP Dictionary'', [[lexicographers]] categorize specialized dictionaries into three types: A [[multi-field dictionary]] broadly covers several subject fields (e.g. a [[business dictionary]]), a [[single-field dictionary]] narrowly covers one particular subject field (e.g. law), and a [[sub-field dictionary]] covers a more specialized field (e.g. constitutional law). For example, the 23-language [[Inter-Active Terminology for Europe]] is a multi-field dictionary, the [[American National Biography]] is a single-field, and the [[African American National Biography Project]] is a sub-field dictionary. In terms of the coverage distinction between "minimizing dictionaries" and "maximizing dictionaries", multi-field dictionaries tend to minimize coverage across subject fields (for instance, ''[[Oxford Dictionary of World Religions]]'' and ''[[Yadgar Dictionary of Computer and Internet Terms]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesindhtimes.com/education/the-first-english-to-einglis-and-sindh-dictionary-of-computer-and-internet-terms-published/|title=The first English to Einglish and Sindhi Dictionary of Computer and Internet Terms published - The Sindh Times|first=The Sindh|last=Times|date=24 February 2015|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011021439/http://www.thesindhtimes.com/education/the-first-english-to-einglis-and-sindh-dictionary-of-computer-and-internet-terms-published/|archive-date=11 October 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas single-field and sub-field dictionaries tend to maximize coverage within a limited subject field (''[[The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology]]'').

Another variant is the [[glossary]], an alphabetical list of defined terms in a specialized field, such as medicine ([[medical dictionary]]).

===Defining dictionaries===
The simplest dictionary, a [[defining dictionary]], provides a [[core glossary]] of the simplest meanings of the simplest concepts. From these, other concepts can be explained and defined, in particular for those who are first learning a language. In English, the commercial defining dictionaries typically include only one or two meanings of under 2000 words. With these, the rest of English, and even the 4000 most common English [[idiom]]s and [[metaphor]]s, can be defined.

===Prescriptive vs. descriptive===
Lexicographers apply two basic philosophies to the defining of words: [[Prescription and description|''prescriptive'' or ''descriptive'']]. [[Noah Webster]], intent on forging a distinct identity for the American language, altered spellings and accentuated differences in meaning and pronunciation of some words. This is why [[American English]] now uses the spelling ''color'' while the rest of the English-speaking world prefers ''colour''. (Similarly, [[British English]] subsequently underwent a few spelling changes that did not affect American English; see further at [[American and British English spelling differences]].)&lt;ref name="Benson2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Phil Benson|title=Ethnocentrism and the English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WeuW7oy7-58C&amp;pg=PA8|year=2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|pages=8–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large 20th-century dictionaries such as the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (OED) and ''[[Webster's Third New International Dictionary|Webster's Third]]'' are descriptive, and attempt to describe the actual use of words. Most dictionaries of English now apply the descriptive method to a word's definition, and then, outside of the definition itself, and information alerting readers to attitudes which may influence their choices on words often considered vulgar, offensive, erroneous, or easily confused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ingrid Tieken-Boon van Ostade|author2=Wim van der Wurff|title=Current Issues in Late Modern English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x91EUnnWwR8C&amp;pg=PA41|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Merriam-Webster]]'' is subtle, only adding italicized notations such as, ''sometimes offensive'' or ''stand'' (nonstandard). ''[[American Heritage Dictionary|American Heritage]]'' goes further, discussing issues separately in numerous "usage notes." ''[[Encarta Webster's Dictionary|Encarta]]'' provides similar notes, but is more prescriptive, offering warnings and admonitions against the use of certain words considered by many to be offensive or illiterate, such as, "an offensive term for..." or "a taboo term meaning...".

Because of the widespread use of dictionaries in schools, and their acceptance by many as language authorities, their treatment of the language does affect usage to some degree, with even the most descriptive dictionaries providing conservative continuity. In the long run, however, the meanings of words in English are primarily determined by usage, and the language is being changed and created every day.&lt;ref&gt;Ned Halley, ''The Wordsworth Dictionary of Modern English Grammar'' (2005), p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Jorge Luis Borges]] says in the prologue to "El otro, el mismo": "''It is often forgotten that (dictionaries) are artificial repositories, put together well after the languages they define. The roots of language are irrational and of a magical nature.''"

Sometimes the same dictionary can be descriptive in some domains and prescriptive in others. For example, according to [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], the ''Oxford English-Hebrew Dictionary'' is "at war with itself": whereas its coverage (lexical items) and glosses (definitions) are descriptive and colloquial, its [[Niqqud|vocalization]] is prescriptive. This internal conflict results in absurd sentences such as ''hi taharóg otí kshetiré me asíti lamkhonít'' (she'll tear me apart when she sees what I've done to the car). Whereas ''hi taharóg otí'', literally 'she will kill me', is colloquial, me (a variant of ma 'what') is archaic, resulting in a combination that is unutterable in real life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] (1999). [http://www.professorzuckermann.com/review-of-the-oxford-english-hebrew- Review of the Oxford English-Hebrew Dictionary], ''[[International Journal of Lexicography]]'' 12.4, pp. 325-346.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical dictionaries ===
A [[historical dictionary]] is a specific kind of descriptive dictionary which describes the development of words and senses over time, usually using citations to original source material to support its conclusions.

===Dictionaries for natural language processing===
In contrast to traditional dictionaries, which are designed to be used by human beings, dictionaries for [[natural language processing]] (NLP) are built to be used by computer programs. The final user is a human being but the direct user is a program. Such a dictionary does not need to be able to be printed on paper. The structure of the content is not linear, ordered entry by entry but has the form of a complex network (see [[Diathesis alternation]]). Because most of these dictionaries are used to control [[machine translation]]s or [[cross-lingual information retrieval]] (CLIR) the content is usually multilingual and usually of huge size. In order to allow formalized exchange and merging of dictionaries, an ISO standard called [[Lexical Markup Framework]] (LMF) has been defined and used among the industrial and academic community.

==Pronunciation==
{{Main|International Phonetic Alphabet chart for English dialects|Pronunciation respelling for English}}
In many languages, such as the English language, the pronunciation of some words is not consistently  apparent from their spelling. In these languages, dictionaries usually provide the pronunciation. For example, the definition for the word ''dictionary'' might be followed by the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] spelling {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɪ|k|ʃ|ə|n|ɛr|i}}. American English dictionaries often use their own[[pronunciation respelling]] systems with [[diacritic]]s, for example ''dictionary''  is respelled as "dĭk'''′'''shə-nĕr′ē" in the [[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|American Heritage Dictionary]].{{refn|{{Cite American Heritage Dictionary|dictionary}}}} The IPA is more commonly used within the British Commonwealth countries. Yet others use their own pronunciation respelling systems without diacritics: for example, ''dictionary'' may be respelled as {{respell|DIK|shə|nerr|ee}}. Some online or electronic dictionaries provide audio recordings of words being spoken.

==Online dictionaries==

The age of the Internet brought online dictionaries to the desktop and, more recently, to the smart phone. [[David Skinner (journalist)|David Skinner]] in 2013 noted that "Among the top ten lookups on Merriam-Webster Online at this moment are 'holistic, pragmatic, caveat, esoteric' and 'bourgeois.' Teaching users about words they don’t already know has been, historically, an aim of lexicography, and modern dictionaries do this well."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Skinner (journalist)|David Skinner]], [http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/17/the-role-of-a-dictionary/?nl=todaysheadlines&amp;emc=edit_th_20130518  The Role of a Dictionary] in "Opinionator: Exclusive Online Commentary from the Times", ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
There exist a number of websites which operate as online dictionaries, usually with a specialized focus. Some of them have exclusively user driven content, often consisting of [[neologisms]]. Some of the more notable examples include:

'''Informationsdienst Wissenschaft e.V.''' or idw (The Science Information Service) operates an Internet platform, which bundles the press reports and dates of important events from about 1,000 scientific institutions, including universities, technical colleges, governmental and non-governmental research institutes and institutes to support research or scientific administration. idw (a registered charitable society) also operates an expert broker, the idw expert finder, which is exclusively for journalists. This makes idw one of the most comprehensive sources of science news in the German-speaking area. Foreign journalists and institutions (mostly European) now use idw as well. 
[[Image: new idw-logo.png|thumb|Informationsdienst Wissenschaft e.v.]] 

The two main objectives of idw are:
* To provide the public with a comprehensive picture of science in the German-speaking area.
* To create a close network between the linked (research) institutions.

==Services==
The information in idw can be accessed free of charge - either directly on idw’s www pages, or by using an individually configurable RSS feed or as an e-mail subscriber. Any user can request the information covering the topics and regions which interest him. All idw services can be used free of cost - the current news ticker, the science calendar, research in the archive (which contains more than 350,000 press releases), and the list of institutions linked to idw. idw also provides journalists with instruments for contacting experts, and maintains a database with science photos.
The members' press offices have various possibilities of communicating with journalists. Membership is only offered to German or foreign institutions which perform research or teaching, or which support science or are active in science in some other way.

==Idea and Foundation==
The original idea of idw was to provide experts for journalists. Using the American ProfNet as example,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Heisser Draht zur Forschung |url=http://www.spiegel.de/unispiegel/studium/0,1518,140281,00.html |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=19 June 2001 |accessdate=17 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the press officers of [http://www.uni-bayreuth.de Universitaet Bayreuth], the [[Ruhr University Bochum]] and the Clausthal University of Technology, in collaboration with Computing Centre of Clausthal University of Technology/[http://www.tu-clausthal.de TU Clausthal], developed a concept for a German language network, by means of the new media. The concept was technically implemented by the staff of the Computing Centre of the Clausthal University of Technology. A total of nine staff members in Bayreuth, Bochum and Clausthal are responsible for programming, maintaining and developing the idw operating system, for user services and further development of the content.

==Financial Support and Development==
The initial phase (1996–1999) was guaranteed by project support from the Federal Ministry for Education and Research ([[BMBF]]). The technical development of the idw was supported by the Ministry, together with the [http://www.stifterverband.de Stifterverband fuer die Deutsche Wissenschaft] (Donor Association for German Science). idw has been working closely for years with the initiative [[Wissenschaft im Dialog]] (Science in Dialogue). idw has been economically independent since 2000 and is financed by contributions from member institutions. It has been organised as a registered charitable society (gemeinnütziger e. V.) since 2002.

==Significance and Scope==
idw has developed as a recognised and accepted source for German language science and for science journalism. It has become an instrument for public relations work for scientific institutions. 
About 37,000 subscribers (figure for June 2018&lt;ref&gt;http://www.idw-online.de/en/aboutus&lt;/ref&gt;) receive regular reports from idw, including some 7,900 journalists. About 1,000 institutions publish their press reports and dates of important events via idw.

'''Leslie Gilbert Pine''' (22 December 1907 – 15 May 1987) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[author]], [[lecturer]], and researcher in the areas of [[genealogy]], [[nobility]], history, [[heraldry]] and [[animal welfare]].{{ref|ancestry3}}  He was born in 1907 in [[Bristol]], [[England]] and died in [[Bury St. Edmunds]], [[Suffolk]] in 1987.  He was the son of Lilian Grace Beswetherick and Henry Moorshead Pine (a tea merchant).{{ref|ancestry1}}

From 1935 to 1940 he served as an assistant [[editing|editor]] at [[Burke's Peerage]] Ltd. During [[World War II]] he was an officer in the [[Royal Air Force]] intelligence branch, serving in [[North Africa]], [[Italy]], [[Greece]], and [[India]]; he retired with the rank of Squadron Leader. After the war and until 1960, he was Burke's executive director. Pine edited ''Burke's Peerage,'' 1949-1959; ''Burke's Landed Gentry (of Great Britain),'' 1952; ''Burke's Landed Gentry (of Ireland),'' 1958; and, ''Burke's Distinguished Families of America,'' 1939, 1947.  He also edited ''The International Year Book and Statesmen's Who's Who,'' 1953-1960; ''Author's and Writer's Who's Who,'' 1948, 1960; ''Who's Who in Music,'' 1949; and, ''Who's Who in the Free Churches,'' 1951.{{ref|pine1}}

A graduate of London University, he became a Barrister-at-Law, Inner Temple, in 1953. Pine was a member of the International Institute of Genealogy and Heraldry, Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, a Fellow of the Ancient Monuments Society, a Life Fellow of the Institute of Journalists, a [[Freedom of the City#Freedom of the City of London|Freeman]] of the [[City of London]], and a Liveryman of the Glaziers' Company.  In [[United Kingdom general election, 1959|1959]] he was the unsuccessful [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidate for [[Bristol Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol Central]].

He was managing editor of a British hunting magazine, ''[[Shooting Times]]'', from 1960 to 1964.{{ref|Times1}} He later authored an important book highly critical of [[sport hunting]], ''After Their Blood'', in which he wrote: "It is our duty as men and women of God’s redeemed creation to try not to increase the suffering of the world, but to lessen it. To get rid of bloodsports will be a great step toward this end."

In 1948 Leslie Pine married Grace V. Griffin (20 August 1914- ). Their only child, [[Richard Pine]], was born in London on 21 August 1949.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15477">Many early [[Islamic]] [[philosophers]] and [[logician]]s discussed the [[liar paradox]]. Their work on the subject began in the 10th century and continued to [[Athīr al-Dīn al-Abharī]] and [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]] of the middle 13th century&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp97&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; and beyond.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp123&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Liar paradox has been well known in [[Greeks|Greek]] and [[Latin]] traditions, the works of Arabic scholars have only recently been translated into [[English language|English]].&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp97/&gt;

Each group of early Islamic philosophers discussed different problems presented by the paradox. They pioneered unique solutions that were not influenced by [[Western philosophy|Western]] ideas.

== Athīr and the Liar paradox ==
Athīr al-Dīn Mufaḍḍal (b. ʿUmar Abharī, d. 663/1264) was a [[Persian people|Persian]] [[philosopher]], [[astronomer]] and [[mathematician]] from the city of [[Abhar]] in [[Persia]]. There is some speculation that his works on the Liar paradox could have been known to Western logicians, and in particular to [[Thomas Bradwardine]].&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp113&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He analyzed the Liar sentence as follows:

{{quotation|One of the difficult [[fallacies]] is the conjunction of the two [[contradiction|contradictories]] (Jamʿal-naqīḍyan) when someone says, “All that I say at this moment is false”. This sentence (qawl) is either true or false. If it is true, then it must be true and false. And if it is not true, then it is necessary that one of his sentences at this moment is true, as long as he utters something. But, he says nothing at this moment other than this sentence. Thus, this sentence is necessarily true and false.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp107/&gt;}}

In other words, Athīr says that if the Liar sentence is false, which means that the Liar falsely declares that all he says at the moment is false, then the Liar sentence is true; and, if the Liar sentence is true, which means that the Liar truthfully declares that all he says at the moment is false, then the Liar sentence is false. In any case, the Liar sentence is both true and false at the same time, which is a [[paradox]].&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp107&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Athīr offers the following solution for the paradox:

{{quotation|To solve the paradox we say: we should not concede that if it is false then one of his sentences (kalām) is true. For its being true is taken to be the [[De Morgan's laws#Negation of a conjunction|conjunction]] of its being true and being false. Therefore its being false necessitates the non-conjunction of its being true and being false. And the non-conjunction of its being true and being false does not necessitate
its being true.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp107/&gt;}}

According to the traditional idealization&lt;ref name=sep&gt;{{Citation

*Other examples of a counter-instance include: it is false to say that all birds could fly because there are some that could not, like for example [[penguin]]s.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp108/&gt;
*Other examples of an empty subject term include: it is false to say that all [[Magic carpet|flying carpets]] have four corners, and not only because some carpets are round or have three corners, but rather because there are no flying carpets at all.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp108/&gt;

The Liar sentence, however, has neither an empty subject nor counter-instance. This fact creates obstacles for Athīr's view, who must show what is unique about the Liar sentence, and how the Liar sentence still could be only true or false in view of the "true" and "false" conditions set up in the universal proposition's description. Athīr tries to solve the paradox by applying to it the laws of negation of a conjunction and negation of a disjunction.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp108/&gt;

Ahmed Alwishah, who has a Ph.D. in Islamic [[Philosophy]] and David Sanson, who has a Ph.D. in Philosophy explain that Athīr actually claims that:

(1) "It is not the case that, if the Liar Sentence is not both true and false, then it is true."&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp110&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alwishah and Sanson continue:
"The general principle behind (1) is clear enough: the negation of a conjunction does not [[Logical consequence|entail]] the negation of a conjunct; so from not both true and false you cannot infer not false and so true. Abharī appears to be saying that the Liar rests on an elementary scope fallacy! But, of course, Abharī is not entitled to (1). In some cases, the negation of a conjunction does entail the negation of a conjunct: 'not both P and P' for example, entails 'not P'. As a general rule, the negation of a conjunction entails the negation of each conjunct whenever the conjuncts are logically equivalent, i.e., whenever the one follows from the other and vice verse. So Abharī is entitled to (1) only if he is entitled to assume that ‘The Liar Sentence is true’ and ‘The Liar Sentence is false’ are not logically equivalent."&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp110/&gt;

The Liar sentence is a universal proposition (The Liar says '''All''' I say ...), so "if it is (non&amp;ndash;[[vacuously]]) false it must have a counter&amp;ndash;instance".&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp110/&gt; But in this case scenario, when the only thing that the liar is saying is the single sentence declaring that what he is saying at the moment is false, the only available counter&amp;ndash;instance is the Liar sentence itself. When staging the paradox Abharī said: "if it is not true, then it is necessary that one of his sentences at this moment is true, as long as he utters something. But, he says nothing at this moment other than this sentence. Thus, this sentence is [[logical truth|necessarily true]] and false"&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp107/&gt; So the explanation provided by Abharī himself demonstrates that both "'The Liar Sentence is false' and 'The Liar Sentence is true' are [[logically equivalent]]. If they are logically equivalent, then, contrary to (1), the negation of the conjunction does entail the negation of each conjunct. Abharī’s 'solution; therefore fails."&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp111&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nasir al-Din al-Tusi on the Liar paradox==
[[File:Nasir al-Din Tusi.jpg|[[Naṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī]] commemorated on an Iranian stamp on the 700th anniversary of his death|250px|thumb]]

Naṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī was a [[Persian people|Persian]]&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite web|title=Tusi, Nasir al-Din al-|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9073899|work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=27 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[polymath]]&lt;ref name=Nasrp199&gt;{{Harvnb|Nasr|2006|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prolific writer: an [[Islamic astronomy|astronomer]], [[biologist]], [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|chemist]], [[Islamic mathematics|mathematician]], [[Early Islamic philosophy|philosopher]], [[Islamic medicine|physician]], [[Islamic physics|physicist]], [[Islamic science|scientist]], [[Kalam|theologian]] and [[Grand Ayatollah|Marja Taqleed]]. He adhered to the [[Ismaili]], and subsequently [[Twelver Shi`ism|Twelver]] [[Shia Islam|Shī‘ah]] [[Islam]]ic belief systems.&lt;ref name="Ṭūsīp2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ṭūsī|2005|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab scholar [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332–1406) considered Tusi to be the greatest of the later [[Persian people|Persian]] scholars.

Ṭūsī's work on the paradox begins with a discussion of the paradox and the solution offered by Abharī, with which Ṭūsī disagrees. As Alwishah and Sanson point out "Ṭūsī argues that whatever fancy thing (conjunction, conditional) Abharī wants to identify as the truth condition for the Liar Sentence, it will not matter, because pace Abharī, we can generate the paradox without inferring, from the negation of a complex truth condition, the negation of one of its parts. We can argue directly that its being false entails the negation of its being false, and so entails its being true."&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp114&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ṭūsī then prepares a stage for his own solution of the Liar paradox, writing that:
{{quotation|If a declarative sentence, by its nature, can declare-something-about anything, then it is possible that it itself can declare-something-about another declarative sentence.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp115&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He does not see a reason that could prevent a declarative sentence to declare something about another declarative sentence.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp115/&gt;

With an example of two declarative sentences, (D1) "It is false" and (D2) "Zayd is sitting", Ṭūsī explains how one declarative sentence (D1) can declare another declarative sentence (D2) to be false: "It is false that Zayd is sitting".&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp115/&gt; There is no paradox in the above two declarative sentences because they have different subjects. To generate a paradox a declarative sentence must declare something about itself. If (D1) falsely declares itself to be not (D1) then this false declaration referencing to itself as being "false" creates a paradox.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp115/&gt;

Ṭūsī writes: {{Quotation|Moreover, if the first declarative sentence declares itself to be false, then [both] its being true, insofar as it is a declarative sentence, and its being false, insofar as it is that-about-which-something-is-declared, are concomitant. Thus, the following paradox can be generated: The first declarative sentence, which is a declaration (khabar) about itself, namely that it is false, is either false or true. If it is true, then it must be false, because it declares itself to be false. If it is false, then it must be true, because if it is said falsely, then it will become true, which is absurd.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp116&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The above conclusions are very important to the history of Liar Paradox. Alwishah and Sanson point out: "It is hard to overemphasize how remarkable this passage is. The contemporary reader will be familiar with the idea that the Liar Paradox is a paradox of selfreference. But Ṭūsī is, as far as we know, the first person to express this idea. This passage has no precedent in any tradition. Ṭūsī has performed three remarkable feats in short order. First, his Liar Sentence is singular: its subject is itself, and it declares itself to be false. Gone, then, is the choice between universal or particular Liar Sentence, and the associated problem of adding further assumptions to generate a genuine paradox. Second, he has characterized the paradox as one of [[List of paradoxes#Self-reference|self-reference]]. Third, he has identified a key assumption that might be responsible for generating the entire problem: the assumption that a declarative sentence, by its nature, can declare-something-about anything."&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp116/&gt;

Recognizing that, if a [[declarative sentence]] that [[Self-reference|declares itself]] being false, is false, this does not necessitate it being true. Ṭūsī says that it would be absurd to say that this declarative sentence is true only because it is not false.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp116/&gt; Ṭūsī writes:{{Quotation|. . . its being false, insofar as it is a declarative sentence, does not necessitate its being true. Instead, its being false necessitates the denial of its being false, insofar as it is that-about-which-something-is-declared, and [necessitates] its being false, insofar as it is a declarative sentence. Hence, we should not concede that, in this way, the denial of its being false necessitates its being true.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp117&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ṭūsī then interprets the definitions of "true" and "false", in an attempt to prove that those definitions should not be taken into consideration when dealing with a declarative sentence that declares itself, as its own subject, to be false.

Al-Baghdādī's definition of "truth" and "falsity" says that: ''"truth is an agreement with the subject, and falsity is the opposite of that"''. Ṭūsī argues that this definition cannot be applied to a declarative sentence that declares its own subject to be false because then there are at least two opposite parts that are in disagreement with each other. The same subject cannot be in disagreement with itself. Therefore a self&amp;ndash;referenced declarative sentence that declares itself to be false is neither false nor true, and truth/falsity definitions are not applicable to those sentences.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp121&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|the result of a judgment that applies truth and falsity to something to which they in no way apply, and to apply them in any way is the misuse of a predicate.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp121/&gt;}}

Ṭūsī stopped short from offering a solution for the Liar sentences discussed by Āmidī "All that I say at this moment is false". This sentence presents a different case scenario because it can be interpreted as declaring something about itself, and something about another sentence. The solution for this paradox is absent from Ṭūsī's papers.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp122&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2910">A '''metabibliography''' (or '''biblio-bibliography''') is a [[bibliography]] of bibliographies.

Bibliographies serve the finding of relevant documents. Metabibliographies serve the finding of the relevant bibliographies in which the relevant documents may be found. One might quote Patrick Wilson:

"For if knowledge is power, power over knowledge is power to increase one's power; and if the stock of writings is thought of mainly as it represents a stock of knowledge, it is natural to propose treating it as a "resource" to be subjected to rational control, managemenet and utilization." (Wilson, 1968, p. 145).

Metabibliographies are valuable for building reference collections, but usually of less interest to the average user, who rely on bibliographies selected by others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10820">'''Non-well-founded set theories''' are variants of [[axiomatic set theory]] that allow sets to contain themselves and otherwise violate the rule of [[well-foundedness]]. In non-well-founded set theories, the [[axiom of regularity|foundation axiom]] of [[ZFC]] is replaced by axioms implying its negation.

The study of non-well-founded sets was initiated by [[Dmitry Mirimanoff]] in a series of papers between 1917 and 1920, in which he formulated the distinction between well-founded and non-well-founded sets; he did not regard well-foundedness as an [[axiom]]. Although a number of axiomatic systems of non-well-founded sets were proposed afterwards, they did not find much in the way of applications until [[Peter Aczel]]’s [[hyperset theory]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Pakkan and Akman (1994, [http://tinf2.vub.ac.be/~dvermeir/mirrors/www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/%257Eakman/jour-papers/air/node8.html section link]); Rathjen (2004); Sangiorgi (2011) pp. 17–19, 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of non-well-founded sets has been applied in the [[logic]]al [[model (abstract)|modelling]] of non-terminating [[Computing|computational]] processes in computer science ([[process algebra]] and [[final semantics]]), [[linguistics]] and [[natural language]] [[semantics]] ([[situation theory]]), philosophy (work on the [[Liar Paradox]]), and in a different setting, [[non-standard analysis]].{{sfnp|Ballard|Hrbáček|1992|p=}}

== Details ==
In 1917, Dmitry Mirimanoff introduced&lt;ref&gt;Levy (2002), p.&amp;nbsp;68; Hallett (1986), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TM3AKPYdQVgC&amp;pg=PA186 p.&amp;nbsp;186]; Aczel (1988) p. 105 all citing Mirimanoff (1917)&lt;/ref&gt; the concept of [[well-founded set|well-foundedness]] of a set:

:A set, x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, is well-founded if it has no infinite descending membership sequence &lt;math&gt; \cdots \in x_2 \in x_1 \in x_0. &lt;/math&gt;

In ZFC, there is no infinite descending ∈-sequence by the [[axiom of regularity]]. In fact, the axiom of regularity is often called the ''foundation axiom'' since it can be proved within ZFC&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (that is, ZFC without the axiom of regularity) that well-foundedness implies regularity. In variants of ZFC without the [[axiom of regularity]], the possibility of non-well-founded sets with set-like ∈-chains arises. For example, a set ''A'' such that ''A'' ∈ ''A'' is non-well-founded.

Although Mirimanoff also introduced a notion of isomorphism between possibly non-well-founded sets, he considered neither an axiom of foundation nor of anti-foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Aczel (1988) p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, [[Paul Finsler]] introduced the first axiom that allowed non-well-founded sets. After Zermelo adopted Foundation into his own system in 1930 (from previous work of [[von Neumann]] 1925–1929) interest in non-well-founded sets waned for decades.{{sfnp|Aczel|1988|p=107}} An early non-well-founded set theory was [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]’s [[New Foundations]], although it is not merely ZF with a replacement for Foundation.

Several proofs of the independence of Foundation from the rest of ZF were published in 1950s particularly by [[Paul Bernays]] (1954), following an announcement of the result in earlier paper of his from 1941, and by [[Ernst Specker]] who gave a different proof in his [[Habilitationsschrift]] of 1951, proof which was published in 1957. Then in 1957 [[Rieger's theorem]] was published, which gave a general method for such proof to be carried out, rekindling some interest in non-well-founded axiomatic systems.{{sfnp|Aczel|1988|pp=107–108}} The next axiom proposal came in a 1960 congress talk of [[Dana Scott]] (never published as a paper), proposing an alternative axiom now called [[Anti-Foundation Axiom|SAFA]].{{sfnp|Aczel|1988|pp=108–109}} Another axiom proposed in the late 1960s was [[Maurice Boffa]]'s axiom of [[superuniversality]], described by Aczel as the highpoint of research of its decade.{{sfnp|Aczel|1988|p=110}} Boffa's idea was to make foundation fail as badly as it can (or rather, as extensionality permits): Boffa's axiom implies that every [[extensionality|extensional]] [[binary relation|set-like]] relation is isomorphic to the elementhood predicate on a transitive class.

A more recent approach to non-well-founded set theory, pioneered by M. Forti and F. Honsell in the 1980s, borrows from computer science the concept of a [[bisimulation]]. Bisimilar sets are considered indistinguishable and thus equal, which leads to a strengthening of the [[axiom of extensionality]]. In this context, axioms contradicting the axiom of regularity are known as '''anti-foundation axioms''', and a set that is not necessarily well-founded is called a '''hyperset'''.

Four mutually [[Independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] anti-foundation axioms are well-known, sometimes abbreviated by the first letter in the following list:
# '''A'''FA ("Anti-Foundation Axiom") – due to M. Forti and F. Honsell (this is also known as [[Aczel's anti-foundation axiom]]);
# '''S'''AFA ("Scott’s AFA") – due to [[Dana Scott]],
# '''F'''AFA ("Finsler’s AFA") – due to [[Paul Finsler]],
# '''B'''AFA ("Boffa’s AFA") – due to [[Maurice Boffa]].
They essentially correspond to four different notions of equality for non-well-founded sets. The first of these, AFA, is based on [[accessible pointed graph]]s (apg) and states that two hypersets are equal if and only if they can be pictured by the same apg.  Within this framework, it can be shown that the so-called [[Quine atom]], formally defined by Q={Q}, exists and is unique.

Each of the axioms given above extends the universe of the previous, so that: [[Von Neumann universe|V]] ⊆ A ⊆ S ⊆ F ⊆ B. In the Boffa universe, the distinct Quine atoms form a proper class.&lt;ref&gt;Nitta, Okada, Tsouvaras (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is worth emphasizing that hyperset theory is an extension of classical set theory rather than a replacement: the well-founded sets within a hyperset domain conform to classical set theory.

== Applications ==
{{expand section|date=November 2012}}
Aczel’s hypersets were extensively used by [[Jon Barwise]] and [[John Etchemendy]] in their 1987 book ''The Liar'', on the [[liar's paradox]]; The book is also good introduction to the topic of non-well-founded sets.

Boffa’s superuniversality axiom has found application as a basis for axiomatic [[nonstandard analysis]].{{sfnp|Kanovei|Reeken|2004|p=303}}

'''Recursion''' occurs when a thing is defined in terms of itself or of its type. Recursion is used in a variety of disciplines ranging from [[linguistics]] to [[logic]]. The most common application of recursion is in [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], where a [[function (mathematics)|function]] being defined is applied within its own definition. While this apparently defines an infinite number of instances (function values), it is often done in such a way that no loop or infinite chain of references can occur.

==Formal definitions==
[[File:Serpiente alquimica.jpg|thumb|[[Ouroboros]], an ancient symbol depicting a serpent or dragon eating its own tail.]]
In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], a class of objects or methods exhibit recursive behavior when they can be defined by two properties:
# {{anchor|base case}}A simple '''base case''' (or cases)—a terminating scenario that does not use recursion to produce an answer
# A set of rules that reduce all other cases toward the base case

For example, the following is a recursive definition of a person's ancestors:
*One's [[parent]]s are one's [[ancestor]]s (''base case'').
*The ancestors of one's ancestors are also one's ancestors (''recursion step'').

The [[Fibonacci sequence]] is a classic example of recursion:

&lt;math&gt;\text{Fib}(0)=0\text{ as base case 1,}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\text{Fib}(1)=1\text{ as base case 2,}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\text{For all integers }n&gt;1,~\text{ Fib}(n):=\text{Fib}(n-1) + \text{Fib}(n-2).&lt;/math&gt;

Many mathematical axioms are based upon recursive rules. For example, the formal definition of the [[natural number]]s by the [[Peano axioms]] can be described as: ''0 is a natural number, and each natural number has a successor, which is also a natural number.'' By this base case and recursive rule, one can generate the set of all natural numbers.

Recursively defined mathematical objects include [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, [[set (mathematics)|sets]], and especially [[fractal]]s.

There are various more tongue-in-cheek "definitions" of recursion; see [[#Recursive humor|recursive humor]].

==Informal definition==
[[File:Sourdough.jpg|thumb|Recently refreshed [[sourdough]], bubbling through [[fermentation]]: the [[recipe]] calls for some sourdough left over from the last time the same recipe was made.]]

Recursion is the process a procedure goes through when one of the steps of the procedure involves  invoking the procedure itself. A procedure that goes through recursion is said to be 'recursive'.

To understand recursion, one must recognize the distinction between a procedure and the running of a procedure. A procedure is a set of steps based on a set of rules. The running of a procedure involves actually following the rules and performing the steps.  An analogy: a procedure is like a written recipe; running a procedure is like actually preparing the meal.

Recursion is related to, but not the same as, a reference within the specification of a procedure to the execution of some other procedure. For instance, a recipe might refer to cooking vegetables, which is another procedure that in turn requires heating water, and so forth. However, a recursive procedure is where (at least) one of its steps calls for a new instance of the very same procedure, like a [[sourdough]] recipe calling for some dough left over from the last time the same recipe was made. This immediately creates the possibility of an endless loop; recursion can only be properly used in a definition if the step in question is skipped in certain cases so that the procedure can complete, like a sourdough recipe that also tells you how to get some starter dough in case you've never made it before. Even if properly defined, a recursive procedure is not easy for humans to perform, as it requires distinguishing the new from the old (partially executed) invocation of the procedure; this requires some administration of how far various simultaneous instances of the procedures have progressed. For this reason recursive definitions are very rare in everyday situations. An example could be the following procedure to find a way through a [[maze]]. Proceed forward until reaching either an exit or a branching point (a dead end is considered a branching point with 0 branches). If the point reached is an exit, terminate. Otherwise try each branch in turn, using the procedure recursively; if every trial fails by reaching only dead ends, return on the path that led to this branching point and report failure. Whether this actually defines a terminating procedure depends on the nature of the maze: it must not allow loops. In any case, executing the procedure requires carefully recording all currently explored branching points, and which of their branches have already been exhaustively tried.

==In language==
Linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] among many others has argued that the lack of an upper bound on the number of grammatical sentences in a language, and the lack of an upper bound on grammatical sentence length (beyond practical constraints such as the time available to utter one), can be explained as the consequence of recursion in natural language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinker|first=Steven|title=The Language Instinct|year=1994|publisher=William Morrow}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.cognition.2004.08.004 | title = The faculty of language: What's so special about it? | year = 2005 | last1 = Pinker | first1=Steven | last2 = Jackendoff | first2=Ray | journal = Cognition | volume = 95 | issue = 2 | pages = 201–236 | pmid=15694646| citeseerx = 10.1.1.116.7784 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be understood in terms of a recursive definition of a syntactic category, such as a sentence. A sentence can have a structure in which what follows the verb is another sentence: ''Dorothy thinks witches are dangerous'', in which the sentence ''witches are dangerous'' occurs in the larger one. So a sentence can be defined recursively (very roughly) as something with a structure that includes a noun phrase, a verb, and optionally another sentence. This is really just a special case of the mathematical definition of recursion.

This provides a way of understanding the creativity of language—the unbounded number of grammatical sentences—because it immediately predicts that sentences can be of arbitrary length: ''Dorothy thinks that Toto suspects that Tin Man said that...''. There are many structures apart from sentences that can be defined recursively, and therefore many ways in which a sentence can embed instances of one category inside another. Over the years, languages in general have proved amenable to this kind of analysis.

Recently, however, the generally accepted idea that recursion is an essential property of human language has been challenged by [[Daniel Everett]] on the basis of his claims about the [[Pirahã language]]. Andrew Nevins, David Pesetsky and Cilene Rodrigues are among many who have argued against this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1353/lan.0.0140 |title=Evidence and argumentation: A reply to Everett (2009) |url=http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/people/faculty/pesetsky/Nevins_Pesetsky_Rodrigues_2_Evidence_and_Argumentation_Reply_to_Everett.pdf |year=2009 |last1=Nevins |first1=Andrew |last2=Pesetsky |first2=David |last3=Rodrigues |first3=Cilene |journal=Language |volume=85 |issue=3 |pages=671–681 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106154616/http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/people/faculty/pesetsky/Nevins_Pesetsky_Rodrigues_2_Evidence_and_Argumentation_Reply_to_Everett.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literary [[self-reference]] can in any case be argued to be different in kind from mathematical or logical recursion.&lt;ref name="Drucker2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Drucker|first=Thomas |title=Perspectives on the History of Mathematical Logic |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R70M4zsVgREC&amp;pg=PA110 |date=4 January 2008 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-0-8176-4768-1 |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recursion plays a crucial role not only in syntax, but also in [[natural language semantics]]. The word ''and'', for example, can be construed as a function that can apply to sentence meanings to create new sentences, and likewise for noun phrase meanings, verb phrase meanings, and others. It can also apply to intransitive verbs, transitive verbs, or ditransitive verbs. In order to provide a single denotation for it that is suitably flexible, ''and'' is typically defined so that it can take any of these different types of meanings as arguments. This can be done by defining it for a simple case in which it combines sentences, and then defining the other cases recursively in terms of the simple one.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Partee and Mats Rooth. 1983. In Rainer Bäuerle et al., ''Meaning, Use, and Interpretation of Language''. Reprinted in Paul Portner and Barbara Partee, eds. 2002. ''Formal Semantics: The Essential Readings''. Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A [[recursive grammar]] is a formal grammar that contains recursive [[production (computer science)|production rules]].&lt;ref name="ns02"&gt;{{citation

===Recursive humor===
Recursion is sometimes used humorously in computer science, programming, philosophy, or mathematics textbooks, generally by giving a [[circular definition]] or [[self-reference]], in which the putative recursive step does not get closer to a base case, but instead leads to an [[infinite regress]]. It is not unusual for such books to include a joke entry in their [[glossary]] along the lines of:
:Recursion, ''see Recursion''.&lt;ref name=Hunter&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=David|title=Essentials of Discrete Mathematics|year=2011|publisher=Jones and Bartlett|pages=494|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kuwhTxCVovQC&amp;dq=recursion+joke&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variation is found on page 269 in the [[Back-of-the-book index|index]]  of some editions of [[Brian Kernighan]] and [[Dennis Ritchie]]'s book ''[[The C Programming Language (book)|The C Programming Language]]''; the index entry recursively references itself ("recursion 86, 139, 141, 182, 202, 269"). The earliest version of this joke was in "Software Tools" by Kernighan and Plauger, and also appears in "The UNIX Programming Environment" by Kernighan and Pike. It did not appear in the first edition of ''The C Programming Language''.

Another joke is that "To understand recursion, you must understand recursion."&lt;ref name=Hunter/&gt; In the English-language version of the [[Google]] web search engine, when a search for "recursion" is made, the site suggests "Did you mean: ''recursion''." An alternative form is the following, from [[Andrew Plotkin]]: ''"If you already know what recursion is, just remember the answer. Otherwise, find someone who is standing closer to [[Douglas Hofstadter]] than you are; then ask him or her what recursion is."''

[[Recursive acronym]]s can also be examples of recursive humor. [[PHP]], for example, stands for "PHP Hypertext Preprocessor", [[Wine (software)|WINE]] stands for "WINE Is Not an Emulator." and [[GNU]] stands for "GNU's not Unix".

===Recursively defined sets===
{{Main|Recursive definition}}

====Example: the natural numbers====
{{see also|Closure (mathematics)}}
The canonical example of a recursively defined set is given by the [[natural numbers]]:

:0 is in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;
:if ''n'' is in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, then ''n'' + 1 is in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;
:The set of natural numbers is the smallest set satisfying the previous two properties.

====Example: The set of true reachable propositions====
Another interesting example is the set of all "true reachable" propositions in an [[axiomatic system]].

*If a proposition is an axiom, it is a true reachable proposition.
*If a proposition can be obtained from true reachable propositions by means of inference rules, it is a true reachable proposition.
*The set of true reachable propositions is the smallest set of propositions satisfying these conditions.

This set is called 'true reachable propositions' because in non-constructive approaches to the foundations of mathematics, the set of true propositions may be larger than the set recursively constructed from the axioms and rules of inference. See also [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]].

===Finite subdivision rules===
{{Main|Finite subdivision rule}}
Finite subdivision rules are a geometric form of recursion, which can be used to create [[fractal]]-like images. A subdivision rule starts with a collection of polygons labelled by finitely many labels, and then each polygon is subdivided into smaller labelled polygons in a way that depends only on the labels of the original polygon. This process can be iterated. The standard `middle thirds' technique for creating the [[Cantor set]] is a subdivision rule, as is [[barycentric subdivision]].

===Functional recursion===
A [[function (mathematics)|function]] may be partly defined in terms of itself.  A familiar example is the [[Fibonacci number]] sequence: ''F''(''n'') = ''F''(''n'' − 1) + ''F''(''n'' − 2).  For such a definition to be useful, it must lead to non-recursively defined values, in this case ''F''(0) = 0 and ''F''(1) = 1.

A famous recursive function is the [[Ackermann function]], which—unlike the Fibonacci sequence—cannot easily be expressed without recursion.

===Proofs involving recursive definitions===
Applying the standard technique of [[proof by cases]] to recursively defined sets or functions, as in the preceding sections, yields [[structural induction]], a powerful generalization of [[mathematical induction]] widely used to derive proofs in [[mathematical logic]] and [[computer science]].

===Recursive optimization===
[[Dynamic programming]] is an approach to [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] that restates a multiperiod or multistep optimization problem in recursive form. The key result in dynamic programming is the [[Bellman equation]], which writes the value of the optimization problem at an earlier time (or earlier step) in terms of its value at a later time (or later step).

===The recursion theorem===
In [[set theory]], this is a theorem guaranteeing that recursively defined functions exist.  Given a set ''X'', an element ''a'' of ''X'' and a function &lt;math&gt;f: X \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;, the theorem states that there is a unique function &lt;math&gt;F: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of natural numbers including zero) such that
:&lt;math&gt;F(0) = a&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F(n + 1) = f(F(n))&lt;/math&gt;
for any natural number ''n''.

====Proof of uniqueness====
Take two functions &lt;math&gt;F: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;G: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;  such that:

:&lt;math&gt;F(0) = a&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G(0) = a&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F(n + 1) = f(F(n))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G(n + 1) = f(G(n))&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' is an element of ''X''.

It can be proved by [[mathematical induction]] that &lt;math&gt;F(n) = G(n)&lt;/math&gt; for all natural numbers ''n'':

:'''Base Case''': &lt;math&gt;F(0) = a = G(0)&lt;/math&gt; so the equality holds for &lt;math&gt;n = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

:'''Inductive Step''': Suppose &lt;math&gt;F(k) = G(k)&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;k \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;F(k+1) = f(F(k)) = f(G(k)) = G(k+1).&lt;/math&gt;
::Hence F(k) = G(k) implies F(k+1) = G(k+1).

By induction, &lt;math&gt;F(n) = G(n)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.

==In computer science==
{{Main|Recursion (computer science)}}
A common method of simplification is to divide a problem into subproblems of the same type. As a [[computer programming]] technique, this is called [[divide and conquer algorithm|divide and conquer]] and is key to the design of many important algorithms. Divide and conquer serves as a top-down approach to problem solving, where problems are solved by solving smaller and smaller instances. A contrary approach is [[dynamic programming]]. This approach serves as a bottom-up approach, where problems are solved by solving larger and larger instances, until the desired size is reached.

A classic example of recursion is the definition of the [[factorial]] function, given here in [[C (programming language)|C]] code:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
}&lt;/source&gt;

If not having reached the [[base case (recursion)|base case]] and returning with value {{math|1,}} every [[Instance (computer science)|instantiation]] of the above function creates a new instance of the function, passing to it an input reduced by {{math|1}} ({{code|(n - 1)}}), and returns the result of this (recursive) call, multiplied by its own value of {{code|n}}, analogously to the mathematical definition of the factorial.

Recursion in computer programming is exemplified when a function is defined in terms of simpler, often smaller versions of itself. The solution to the problem is then devised by combining the solutions obtained from the simpler versions of the problem. One example application of recursion is in [[parser]]s for programming languages. The great advantage of recursion is that an infinite set of possible sentences, designs or other data can be defined, parsed or produced by a finite computer program.

[[Recurrence relation]]s are equations to define one or more sequences  recursively. Some specific kinds of recurrence relation can be "solved" to obtain a non-recursive definition.

Use of recursion in an algorithm has both advantages and disadvantages.  The main advantage is usually simplicity.  The main disadvantage is often that the algorithm may require large amounts of memory if the depth of the recursion is very large.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13069">A '''recursive acronym''' is an [[acronym]] that [[recursion|refers to itself]]. The term was first used in print in 1979 in [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s book ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach|Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]]'', in which Hofstadter invents the acronym GOD, meaning "GOD Over Djinn", to help explain infinite series, and describes it as a recursive acronym.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.math.cornell.edu/~mec/Summer2009/ABjorndahl/extension.html |title = Puzzles and Paradoxes: Infinity in Finite Terms |accessdate=2013-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other references followed,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.wordspy.com/words/recursiveacronym.asp |title = WordSpy – Recursive Acronym |accessdate=2008-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however the concept was used as early as 1968 in [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]]'s science fiction novel ''[[Stand on Zanzibar]]''. In the story, the acronym EPT (Education for Particular Task) later morphed into "Eptification for Particular Task".

Recursive acronyms typically form [[Backronym|backwardly]]: either an existing ordinary acronym is given a new explanation of what the letters stand for, or a name is turned into an acronym by giving the letters an explanation of what they stand for, in each case with the first letter standing recursively for the whole acronym.

==Computer-related examples==
In [[computing]], an early tradition in the [[Hacker (hobbyist)|hacker]] community (especially at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]) was to choose acronyms and abbreviations that referred humorously to themselves or to other abbreviations. Perhaps the earliest example in this context, from 1960 the [[backronym]] "Mash Until No Good" was created to describe Mung, and a while after it was revised to "Mung Until No Good".  It lived on as a recursive command in the editing language [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]].&lt;sup&gt;[[Mung (computer term)|[3]]]&lt;/sup&gt; In 1977 or 1978 came TINT ("TINT Is Not [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]]"), an editor for [[MagicSix]] written (and named) by Ted Anderson.  This inspired the two MIT [[Lisp Machine]] editors called [[EINE]] ("EINE Is Not [[Emacs]]", German for ''one'') and [[ZWEI]] ("ZWEI Was EINE Initially", German for ''two''). These were followed by [[Richard Stallman]]'s [[GNU]] (GNU's Not [[Unix]]). Many others also include negatives, such as denials that the thing defined is or resembles something else (which the thing defined does in fact resemble or is even derived from), to indicate that, despite the similarities, it was distinct from the program on which it was based.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fsfe.org/freesoftware/transcripts/rms-fs-2006-03-09.en.html#the-name-gnu The Free Software Movement and the Future of Freedom: The name "GNU"], Richard Stallman, March 9th 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier example appears in a 1976 textbook on data structures, in which the pseudo-language SPARKS is used to define the algorithms discussed in the text. "SPARKS" is claimed to be a non-acronymic name, but "several cute ideas have been suggested" as expansions of the name. One of the suggestions is "Smart Programmers Are Required to Know SPARKS".&lt;ref&gt;Fundamentals Of Data Structures (Ellis Horowitz &amp; [[Sartaj Sahni]], Computer Science Press, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; (this example is [[tail recursive]])

===Mutually recursive or otherwise special===
* The [[GNU Hurd]] project is named with a mutually recursive acronym: "Hurd" stands for "Hird of Unix-Replacing [[Daemon (computer software)|Daemon]]s", and "Hird" stands for "Hurd of Interfaces Representing Depth."
* RPM, PHP, XBMC and YAML were originally conventional acronyms which were later redefined recursively. They are examples of, or may be referred to as, [[backronym]]ization,{{Citation needed|date=September 2010|reason=There's little evidence that this word exists outside of Wikipedia.}} where the official meaning of an acronym is changed.
* [[Jini]] claims the distinction of being the first recursive anti-acronym: 'Jini Is Not Initials'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artima.com/jini/faq.html#acronym ''FAQ for JINI-USERS Mailing List''], Retrieved 18 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to ''The Jini Specification,'' Arnold et al, Pearson, 1999, {{ISBN|0201616343}}&lt;/ref&gt; It might, however, be more properly termed an anti-backronym because the term "Jini" never stood for anything in the first place. The more recent "[[Microsoft XNA|XNA]]", on the other hand, was deliberately designed that way.
* Most recursive acronyms are recursive on the first letter, which is therefore an arbitrary choice, often selected for reasons of humour, ease of pronunciation, or consistency with an earlier acronym that used the same letters for different words, such as PHP, which now stands for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor", but was originally "Personal Home Page".  However [[Yopy|YOPY]], "Your own personal YOPY" is recursive on the last letter (hence the last letter of the acronym had to be the same as the first).

'''Reference''' is a relation between objects in which one object designates, or acts as a means by which to connect to or link to, another object. The first object in this relation is said to ''refer to'' the second object. It is called a ''[[name]]'' for the second object. The second object, the one to which the first object refers, is called the ''[[referent]]'' of the first object. A name is usually a [[phrase]] or expression, or some other [[Symbol|symbolic representation]]. Its referent may be anything – a material object, a person, an event, an activity, or an abstract concept.

References can take on many forms, including: a thought, a sensory perception that is [[Hearing (sense)|audible]] ([[onomatopoeia]]), [[visual perception|visual]] (text), [[olfaction|olfactory]], or tactile, [[emotions|emotional state]], relationship with other,&lt;ref&gt;Treanor, Brian, ''Aspects of alterity: Levinas, Marcel, and the contemporary debate'', Fordham University Press, 2006, p.41&lt;/ref&gt; [[spacetime]] coordinate, [[symbolic system|symbolic]] or [[alpha-numeric grid|alpha-numeric]], a physical object or an energy projection. In some cases, methods are used that intentionally hide the reference from some observers, as in [[cryptography]].

References feature in many spheres of human activity and knowledge, and the term adopts shades of meaning particular to the contexts in which it is used. Some of them are described in the sections below.

==Etymology and meanings==
The word ''reference'' is derived from [[Middle English]] ''referren'', from [[Middle French]] ''référer'', from [[Latin]] ''referre'', "to carry back", formed from the [[prefix]] ''re''- and ''ferre'', "to bear".&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Ernest, ''A comprehensive etymological dictionary of the English language'', Vol II, Elsevier publishing company, Amsterdam, 1969, p.1317&lt;/ref&gt; A number of words derive from the same root, including ''refer'', ''[[referee]]'', ''referential'', ''[[referent]]'', ''[[referendum]]''.

The verb ''refer (to)'' and its derivatives may carry the sense of "link to" or "connect to", as in the meanings of ''reference'' described in this article. Another sense is "consult"; this is reflected in such expressions as [[reference work]], [[reference desk]], [[job reference]], etc.

== Semantics ==
{{further|Sense and reference|Theory of reference}}
[[File:Ogden semiotic triangle.png|thumb|right|220px|The [[triangle of reference]], from the influential book ''[[The Meaning of Meaning]]'' (1923) by [[C. K. Ogden]] and [[I. A. Richards]].]]
In [[semantics]], reference is generally construed as the relationships between [[noun]]s or [[pronoun]]s and objects that are named by them. Hence, the [[word]] "John" refers to the person John. The word "it" refers to some previously specified object. The object referred to is called the ''[[referent]]'' of the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Semantics|first = John | last = Saeed|page = 12|publisher = Blackwell |isbn = 0-631-22693-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the word-object relation is called "[[denotation]]"; the word denotes the object. The converse relation, the relation from object to word, is called "[[exemplification]]"; the object exemplifies what the word denotes. In syntactic analysis, if a word refers to a previous word, the previous word is called the "[[Antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]]".

===Meaning===
[[Gottlob Frege]] argued that reference cannot be treated as identical with [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]: "[[Hesperus]]" (an ancient Greek name for the evening star) and "[[Phosphorus]]" (an ancient Greek name for the morning star) both refer to [[Venus]], but the astronomical fact that '"Hesperus" is "Phosphorus"' can still be informative, even if the "meanings" of "Hesperus" and "Phosphorus" are already known. This problem led Frege to distinguish between the [[sense and reference]] of a word. Some cases seem to be too complicated to be classified within this framework; the acceptance of the notion of [[secondary reference]] may be necessary to fill the gap. See also [[Opaque context]].

===Linguistic sign===
The very concept of the [[linguistic sign]] is the combination of content and expression, the former of which may refer entities in the world or refer more abstract concepts, e.g. thought.
Certain parts of speech exist only to express reference, namely [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphora]] such as [[pronoun]]s. The subset of reflexives expresses co-reference of two participants in a sentence.  These could be the [[Agent (grammar)|agent]] (actor) and patient (acted on), as in "The man washed himself", the theme and recipient, as in "I showed Mary to herself", or various other possible combinations.

==Computer science==
{{Main|Reference (computer science)}}
In [[computer science]], [[Reference (computer science)|reference]]s are [[data type]]s that refer to an object elsewhere in memory and are used to construct a wide variety of [[data structure]]s, such as [[linked list]]s. Generally, a reference is a value that enables a program to directly access the particular data item. Most [[programming language]]s support some form of reference. For the specific type of reference used in the [[C++]] language, see [[reference (C++)]].

The notion of reference is also important in relational [[database theory]]; see [[referential integrity]].

==Library and information sciences==
{{see also|Reference work|Reference desk}}

References to many types of printed matter may come in an electronic or machine-readable form. For books, there exists the [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]] and for journal articles, the [[Digital object identifier|Digital object identifier (DOI)]] is gaining relevance. Information on the [[Internet]] may be referred to by a [[Uniform Resource Identifier|Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)]].

==Psychology==
In terms of mental processing, a [[self-reference]] is used in psychology to establish identification with a mental state during self-analysis. This seeks to allow the individual to develop own frames of reference in a greater state of immediate awareness. However, it can also lead to circular reasoning, preventing evolution of thought.&lt;ref&gt;Engle, Eric, ''Lex Naturalis, Ius Naturalis: Law as Positive Reasoning &amp; Natural Rationality'', The Rlias Clark Group, Melbourne, 2010, p.75&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Perceptual Control Theory (PCT), a reference condition is the state toward which a control system's output tends to alter a controlled quantity. The main proposition is that "All behavior is oriented all of the time around the control of certain quantities with respect to specific reference conditions."&lt;ref&gt;Powers, William, ''Behavior: The Control of Perception'', 2nd ed., Benchmark Publications, New Canaan, Connecticut, 2005, pp.47 &amp; 299&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==
In academics and scholarship, an author-title-date information in [[Bibliography|bibliographies]] and [[footnote]]s, specifying complete works of other people. Copying of material by another author without proper citation or without required permissions is [[plagiarism]].

Keeping a [[diary]] allows an individual to use references for personal organization, whether or not anyone else understands the systems of reference used. However, scholars have studied methods of reference because of their key role in communication and co-operation between ''different'' people, and also because of misunderstandings that can arise. Modern academic study of reference has been developing since the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;
Reimer, Marga (2009). "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reference Reference]". ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In scholarship, a reference may be a [[citation]] of a text that has been used in the creation of a piece of work such as an essay, report, or oration. Its primary purpose is to allow people who read such work to examine the author's sources, either for [[Validity (logic)|validity]] or to learn more about the subject. Such items are often listed at the end of an article or book in a section marked "[[Bibliography]]" or "References". A bibliographical section often contains works not cited by the author, but used as background reading or listed as potentially useful to the reader. A reference section contains only those works cited by the author(s) in the main text.

==Law==
In [[patent]] law, a reference is a document that can be used to show the state of knowledge at a given time and that therefore may make a [[claim (patent)|claim]]ed [[invention]] [[Inventive step and non-obviousness|obvious]] or [[Novelty (patent)#United States|anticipated]]. Examples of references are patents of any country, magazine articles, [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] theses that are indexed and thus accessible to those interested in finding information about the subject matter, and to some extent Internet material that is similarly accessible.

==Arts==
In [[art]], a reference is an item from which a work is based. This may include:
* an existing artwork,
* a reproduction (i.e., photo),
* directly observed object (i.e., person), or
* the artist's memory.
Another example of reference is [[Sampling (music)|samples]] of various musical works being incorporated into a new one.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10284">A '''reference interview''' is a conversation between a [[librarian]] and a [[library]] user, usually at a [[library reference desk|reference desk]], in which the librarian responds to the user's initial explanation of his or her information need by first attempting to clarify that need and then by directing the user to appropriate information resources.

==Definition==
Bopp &amp; Smith (1995) defines the reference interview as the "conversation between a member of the library reference staff and a library user for the purpose of clarifying the user’s needs and aiding the user in meeting those needs".{{sfnp|Bopp|Smith|1995|p=37}} 

According to ODLIS, the reference interview is "the interpersonal communication that occurs between a reference librarian and a library user to determine the person's specific information need(s), which may turn out to be different from the reference question as initially posed...A reference interview may occur in person, by telephone, or electronically (usually via e-mail) at the request of the user, but a well-trained reference librarian will sometimes initiate communication if a hesitant user appears to need assistance".{{sfnp|Reitz|2014}}

== Parts of a reference interview ==

The reference interview is structured to help the librarian provide answers to the library user. In general, the interview is composed of the following stages.{{sfnp|Ross|Nilsen|Dewdney|2002|p=3}}

#Welcoming
#Gathering general information from the user and getting an overview of the problem
#Confirming the exact question
#Intervention, such as giving information, advice or instructions
#Finishing, including feedback and summary

These stages may occur in loops, for example when a clarification of the question leads to the need to establish more background information on the query topic. These steps are designed to put the user at their ease, and then help ensure that they have correctly explained what they require. When the reference librarian believes that the query is fully understood, they attempt to provide resources that help satisfy it. An important and often overlooked final step is checking that the information or service provided was indeed what the library user required.

==Reference interview techniques==

The purpose behind the reference interview structure is to ensure that the library user's [[information need]] is satisfied. The librarian can use a number of interview techniques to help identify the user's exact need. Poor reference interview skills may lead to misinterpretation of the real question, a lack of real help and an unsatisfied library user.{{sfnp|Nilsen|2005|p=3}}

Librarians use many techniques to help identify a user’s information need. With body language, repetition and paraphrasing of what the user says, the interviewer can encourage the user to give more information about what they need. Asking open questions establishes context and helps to identify exactly what is required. A lack of follow-up, or checking that the user found what they required, is arguably one of the most common mistakes made in the reference interview.{{sfnp|Nilsen|2005|p=6}}

==Forming the query==

One of the biggest problems with providing an effective reference service is that of badly formed queries. In this instance, the user's reference question doesn't match up to the information they actually need.{{sfnp|Fields|2006|pp=405-420}} Badly formed queries may lead to user frustration, as they perceive that the reference interview is not solving their problem. 

Many of the techniques used in the reference interview are geared towards developing a badly formed query until a sense of the user's true information need is gained. A great degree of care must be taken when helping users to develop their query. The librarian typically has little insight into the social and psychological barriers that might be preventing the user from explaining their question accurately. Anything from anxiety from an approaching deadline to lack of confidence with language can get in the way.{{sfnp|Murphy|2005|pp=247-252}}

==The virtual reference interview==
{{main| Virtual reference}}
 
As libraries have begun to adopt electronic technology into their operations, the idea of the virtual reference interview has come to light. Virtual reference is a reference service initiated electronically, often in real-time. The user and librarian do not meet face-to-face. Virtual reference services can be conducted, for example, in internet chat, videoconferencing, email, [[cobrowsing|co-browsing]] and [[instant messaging]]. 

Uptake of virtual reference has not been as swift as some had predicted. The complexity of virtual reference may be to blame, as users want information quickly and with the minimum of fuss.{{sfnp|Stormont|2007|p=119}} Some evidence suggests that the problem lies with poor uptake and training among library staff.{{sfnp|Nilsen|2005|p=8}}

==Library users and reference services==

Library users are not always comfortable with reference services, let alone satisfied with them. [[Unobtrusive measures|Unobtrusive user studies]] suggest that only around 55% to 65% of users leave a reference interview satisfied with the result and willing to return.{{sfnp|Nilsen|2005|p=3}} Demographics, social factors and users’ preconceptions about libraries all contribute to this figure. Embarrassment, shyness, and anxiety can prevent a user from approaching the reference desk, and poor signposting and explanation of services can mean that some customers aren't aware that the reference service exists. To be as effective as possible, libraries must be proactive in publicizing their services and reducing the stigma of asking for help.{{sfnp|Robinson|Reid|2007|pp=405-424}}

==Usefulness of the reference interview==

For a long time, the value of the reference interview has stood unquestioned. More recently, with technological developments streamlining some of the tasks which once comprised the interview, some researchers are beginning to question the validity of the reference interview, and the investment that a reference librarian represents.{{sfnp|Ryan|2008|pp=389-399}} Others argue that reference services should broaden their target audience. As people increasingly use the internet to make major, life-affecting decisions, so they also require the services of  professionals who are able to provide help in this environment.{{sfnp|Janes|2003|pp=22-25}} If this proves to be the case, it will become more vital that the reference interview be conducted professionally and successfully. In the age of [[information overload]], a successful reference interview may empower users to confidently make such decisions in their lives.

A '''reference work''' is a [[book]] or [[periodical literature|periodical]] (or [[electronic publishing|its electronic equivalent]]) to which one can refer for [[information]]. The information is intended to be found quickly when needed. Reference works are usually ''referred'' to for particular pieces of information, rather than read beginning to end. The writing style used in these works is informative; the authors avoid use of the first person, and emphasize facts. Many reference works are compiled by a team of contributors whose work is coordinated by one or more editors rather than by an individual author. [[index (publishing)|Indices]] are commonly provided in many types of reference work. Updated [[edition (book)|edition]]s are usually published as needed, in some cases [[annual publication|annually]] (e.g. ''[[Whitaker's Almanack]]'', ''[[Who's Who]]''). Reference works include [[dictionary|dictionaries]], [[thesaurus]]es, [[encyclopedia]]s, [[almanac]]s, [[bibliography|bibliographies]], and [[Library catalog|catalogs]] (e.g. catalogs of libraries, museums or the works of individual artists).&lt;ref name=Library&gt;{{cite web|last=The University of Santo Tomas Miguel de Benavides Library|title=The Reference Materials|url=http://library.ust.edu.ph/pages/reference.html|accessdate=3 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507153507/http://library.ust.edu.ph/pages/reference.html|archivedate=7 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many reference works are available in electronic form and can be obtained as [[application software]], [[CD-ROM]]s, [[DVD]]s, or online through the [[Internet]].

A reference work is useful to its users if they attribute some degree of [[trust (emotion)|trust]].

==Reference book==
In comparison, a '''reference book''' or reference-only book in a [[library]] is one that may only be used in the library and may not be borrowed from the library. Many such books are reference works (in the first sense), which are, usually, used briefly or photocopied from, and therefore, do not need to be borrowed. Keeping reference books in the library assures that they will always be available for use on demand. Some reference-only books are too valuable to permit borrowers to take them out. Reference-only items may be shelved in a reference collection located separately from [[library circulation|circulating]] items. Some libraries consist entirely, or to a large extent, of books which may not be borrowed.

==Electronic resources==
An electronic resource is a piece of information that is stored electronically, which is usually found on a computer, including information that is available on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=AllWords.com|title=Electronic Resources|url=http://www.allwords.com/word-electronic+resource.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libraries offer numerous types of electronic resources, such as subject research guides, indices, electronic books and texts, electronic journals, library catalogs, reference sources, statistical sources, sound recordings, and image databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The University of Chicago Library|title=Types of Electronic Resources|url=https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/net/types.html|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian sources, such as the New Testament books in the Christian Bible, include detailed stories about Jesus but scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the Biblical accounts of Jesus.&lt;ref name=MAPowell168 &gt;{{cite book|title=Jesus as a Figure in History: How Modern Historians View the Man from Galilee|first=Mark Allan|last=Powell|date=1998|isbn=0-664-25703-8|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only two events subject to "almost universal assent" are that [[Baptism of Jesus|Jesus was baptized]] by [[John the Baptist]] and [[Crucifixion of Jesus|was crucified]] by the order of the [[Roman governor|Roman Prefect]] [[Pontius Pilate]].&lt;ref name=AmyJill1&gt;{{cite book|last=Levine|first=Amy-Jill|author-link=Amy-Jill Levine|title=The Historical Jesus in Context|editor=Amy-Jill Levine et al.|date=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-00992-6|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JDunn339&gt;{{cite book|title=Jesus Remembered|first=James D.

Non-Christian sources that are used to study and establish the historicity of Jesus include Jewish sources such as [[Josephus]], and Roman sources such as [[Tacitus]]. These sources are compared to Christian sources such as the [[Pauline Epistles]] and the [[Synoptic Gospels]]. These sources are usually independent of each other (e.g. Jewish sources do not draw upon Roman sources), and similarities and differences between them are used in the authentication process.&lt;ref name="Camber121"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Jesus|first=Markus N.

In a review of the state of research, the Jewish scholar [[Amy-Jill Levine]] stated that "no single picture of Jesus has convinced all, or even most scholars" and that all portraits of Jesus are subject to criticism by some group of scholars.&lt;ref name=AmyJill1 /&gt;

===Key sources===

====Josephus====
{{Main article|Josephus on Jesus}}
[[File:Josephus Antiquitates Iudaice.jpg|thumb|170px|A page from a 1466 copy of ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'']]
The writings of the 1st century [[Roman citizenship|Romano]]-[[List of Jewish historians|Jewish historian]] [[Flavius Josephus]] include references to Jesus and the [[origins of Christianity]].&lt;ref name=FeldHata8754&gt;Feldman, Louis H.; Hata, Gōhei, eds. (1987). ''Josephus, Judaism and Christianity'' BRILL. {{ISBN|978-90-04-08554-1}}. pp. 54–57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Maier95284&gt;Maier, Paul L. (December 1995). ''Josephus, the essential works: a condensation of Jewish antiquities and The Jewish war''. Kregel Academic. {{ISBN|978-0-8254-3260-6}} pp. 284–285&lt;/ref&gt; Josephus' ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'', written around 93–94&amp;nbsp;CE, includes two references to Jesus in Books [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 3|18]] and [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XX#Chapter 9|20]].&lt;ref name=FeldHata8754/&gt;&lt;ref name=Maier9512&gt;Maier, Paul L. (December 1995). ''Josephus, the essential works: a condensation of Jewish antiquities and The Jewish war''. Kregel Academic. {{ISBN|978-0-8254-3260-6}} p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the two passages, the James passage in Book 20 is used by scholars to support the existence of Jesus, the ''Testimonium Flavianum'' in Book 18 his crucifixion.&lt;ref name="Camber121"/&gt; Josephus' James passage attests to the existence of Jesus as a historical person and that some of his contemporaries considered him the Messiah.&lt;ref name=Camber121/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kellum104&gt;Kostenberger, Andreas J.; Kellum, L. Scott; Quarles, Charles L. (2009). ''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' {{ISBN|0-8054-4365-7}} pp. 104–105&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bart Ehrman, Josephus' passage about Jesus was altered by a Christian scribe, including the reference to Jesus as the Messiah.&lt;ref&gt;Bart Ehrman, Jesus Interrupted, p. 159, Harper Collins&lt;/ref&gt;

A textual argument against the authenticity of the James passage is that the use of the term "Christos" there seems unusual for Josephus.&lt;ref name=EB128&gt;Eddy, Paul; Boyd, Gregory (2007). ''The Jesus Legend: A Case for the Historical Reliability of the Synoptic Jesus Tradition''. {{ISBN|0-8010-3114-1}} pp. 128–130&lt;/ref&gt; An argument based on the flow of the text in the document is that, given that the mention of Jesus appears in the ''Antiquities'' before that of the John the Baptist, a Christian interpolator may have inserted it to place Jesus in the text before John.&lt;ref name=EB128/&gt; A further argument against the authenticity of the James passage is that it would have read well even without a reference to Jesus.&lt;ref name=EB128/&gt;

The passage deals with the death of "James the brother of Jesus" in Jerusalem. Whereas the works of Josephus refer to at least twenty different people with [[Jesus (name)|the name Jesus]], this passage specifies that this Jesus was the one "who was called Christ".&lt;ref name=EB129&gt;Eddy, Paul; Boyd, Gregory (2007). ''The Jesus Legend: A Case for the Historical Reliability of the Synoptic Jesus Tradition''. {{ISBN|0-8010-3114-1}} pp. 129–130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Painter137&gt;Painter, John (2005). ''Just James: The Brother of Jesus in History and Tradition''. {{ISBN|0-567-04191-3}} p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Feldman]] states that this passage, above others, indicates that Josephus did say something about Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Louis H.; Hata, Gōhei. ''Josephus, Judaism and Christianity''. Brill. {{ISBN|90-04-08554-8}}. p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholarship has almost universally acknowledged the authenticity of the reference in [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XX#Chapter 9|Book 20, Chapter 9, 1]] of the ''Antiquities'' to "the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James",&lt;ref name=Feldman557&gt;[[Louis Feldman]] ({{ISBN|90-04-08554-8}} pp. 55–57) states that the authenticity of the Josephus passage on James has been "almost universally acknowledged".&lt;/ref&gt; and considers it as having the highest level of authenticity among the references of Josephus to Christianity.&lt;ref name=FeldHata8754/&gt;&lt;ref name=Maier95284/&gt;&lt;ref name=Voorst83&gt;Van Voorst, Robert E. (2000). ''Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence''. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.. {{ISBN|0-8028-4368-9}} p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bauckham "For What Offense Was James Put to Death?" in ''James the Just and Christian origins'' by Bruce Chilton, Craig A. Evans 1999 {{ISBN|90-04-11550-1}} pp. 199–203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Painter134&gt;Painter, John (2005). ''Just James: The Brother of Jesus in History and Tradition''. {{ISBN|0-567-04191-3}} pp. 134–141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=refsummary &gt;Sample quotes from previous references: Van Voorst ({{ISBN|0-8028-4368-9}} p. 83) states that the overwhelming majority of scholars consider both the reference to "the brother of Jesus called Christ" and the entire passage that includes it as authentic."  Bauckham ({{ISBN|90-04-11550-1}} pp. 199–203) states: "the vast majority have considered it to be authentic". Meir ({{ISBN|978-0-8254-3260-6}} pp. 108–109) agrees with Feldman that few have questioned the authenticity of the James passage. Setzer ({{ISBN|0-8006-2680-X}} pp. 108–109) also states that few have questioned its authenticity.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Testimonium Flavianum'' (meaning the testimony of Flavius [Josephus]) is the name given to the passage found in [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 3|Book 18, Chapter 3, 3]] of the ''Antiquities'' in which Josephus describes the condemnation and crucifixion of Jesus at the hands of the Roman authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Flavius Josephus; Whiston, William; Maier, Paul L. (May 1999). ''The New Complete Works of Josephus''. Kregel Academic. {{ISBN|0-8254-2948-X}} p. 662&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schrck38 &gt;Schreckenberg, Heinz; Schubert, Kurt (1992a). ''Jewish Traditions in Early Christian Literature. 2''. {{ISBN|90-232-2653-4}} pp. 38–41&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have differing opinions on the total or partial authenticity of the reference in the passage to the execution of Jesus by [[Pontius Pilate]].&lt;ref name=FeldHata8754/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schrck38 /&gt; The general scholarly view is that while the ''Testimonium Flavianum'' is most likely not authentic in its entirety, it is broadly agreed upon that it originally consisted of an authentic nucleus with a reference to the execution of Jesus by Pilate which was then subject to Christian interpolation.&lt;ref name=Kellum104/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schrck38 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Craig A. (2001). ''Jesus and His Contemporaries: Comparative Studies'' {{ISBN|0-391-04118-5}} p. 316&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wansbrough, Henry (2004). ''Jesus and the oral Gospel tradition''. {{ISBN|0-567-04090-9}} p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dunn141/&gt; Although the exact nature and extent of the Christian redaction remains unclear,&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Schneemelcher, Robert McLachlan Wilson, ''New Testament Apocrypha: Gospels and Related Writings'', p. 490 (James Clarke &amp; Co. Ltd, 2003). {{ISBN|0-664-22721-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is broad consensus as to what the original text of the ''Testimonium'' by Josephus would have looked like.&lt;ref name=Dunn141/&gt;

The references found in ''Antiquities'' have no parallel texts in the other work by Josephus such as the ''[[The Wars of the Jews|Jewish War]]'', written twenty years earlier, but some scholars have provided explanations for their absence, such as that the ''Antiquities'' covers a longer time period and that during the twenty-year gap between the writing of the ''Jewish Wars'' (c. 70 CE) and ''Antiquities'' (after 90 CE) Christians had become more important in Rome and were hence given attention in the ''Antiquities''.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Louis H. (1984). "Flavius Josephus Revisited: The Man, his Writings and his Significance". In Temporini, Hildegard; Haase, Wolfgang. Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt, Part 2. pp. 763–771. {{ISBN|3-11-009522-X}} p. 826&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of variations exist between the statements by Josephus regarding the deaths of James and the [[New Testament]] accounts.&lt;ref name=Painter143&gt;Painter, John (2005). ''Just James: The Brother of Jesus in History and Tradition''. {{ISBN|0-567-04191-3}} pp. 143–145&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars generally view these variations as indications that the Josephus passages are not interpolations, because a Christian interpolator would more likely have made them correspond to the Christian traditions.&lt;ref name=EB129/&gt;&lt;ref name=Painter143/&gt; Robert Eisenman provides numerous early Christian sources that confirm the Josephus testament, that James was the brother of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenman, Robert (2002), "James the Brother of Jesus: the key to unlocking the secrets of Early Christianity and the Dead Sea Scrolls" (Watkins)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tacitus====
{{Main article|Tacitus on Christ}}
[[File:Lipsius manuscript.jpg|thumb|170px|The title page of 1598 edition of the works of Tacitus, kept in [[Empoli]], Italy.]]
The [[Roman historiography|Roman historian]] and [[Roman senate|senator]] [[Tacitus]] referred to [[Jesus|Christ]], [[Crucifixion of Jesus|his execution]] by [[Pontius Pilate]] and the existence of [[early Christians]] in Rome in his final work, ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' (c. AD 116), [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#44|book 15, chapter 44]].&lt;ref&gt;P.E. Easterling, E. J. Kenney (general editors), ''The Cambridge History of Latin Literature'', p. 892 (Cambridge University Press, 1982, reprinted 1996). {{ISBN|0-521-21043-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brent32 &gt;''A political history of early Christianity'' by Allen Brent 2009 {{ISBN|0-567-03175-6}} pp. 32–34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New Testament 2000. pp. 39–53"&gt;[[Robert Van Voorst]], ''Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence'', Wm. B. Eerdmans, 2000. pp. 39–53&lt;/ref&gt; The relevant passage reads: "called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus."

Scholars generally consider Tacitus's reference to the execution of Jesus by [[Pontius Pilate]] to be both authentic, and of historical value as an independent Roman source about early Christianity that is in unison with other historical records.&lt;ref name=VVoorst39 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans42  &gt;''Jesus and His Contemporaries: Comparative Studies'' by Craig A. Evans 2001 {{ISBN|0-391-04118-5}} p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated343"&gt;''Mercer dictionary of the Bible'' by Watson E. Mills, Roger Aubrey Bullard 2001 {{ISBN|0-86554-373-9}} p. 343&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="interpretation2004"&gt;''Pontius Pilate in History and Interpretation'' by Helen K. Bond 2004 {{ISBN|0-521-61620-4}} p. xi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Portier263 /&gt; William L. Portier has stated that the consistency in the references by Tacitus, Josephus and the letters to [[Emperor Trajan]] by [[Pliny the Younger]] reaffirm the validity of all three accounts.&lt;ref name=Portier263 &gt;''Tradition and Incarnation: Foundations of Christian Theology'' by William L. Portier 1993 {{ISBN|0-8091-3467-5}} p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

Tacitus was a patriotic [[Roman senator]] and his writings shows no sympathy towards Christians.&lt;ref name="CEvans42"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated293"&gt;''Ancient Rome'' by William E. Dunstan 2010 {{ISBN|0-7425-6833-4}} p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated293"/&gt;&lt;ref name= MAPowell33 &gt;''Jesus as a figure in history: how modern historians view the man from Galilee'' by Mark Allan Powell 1998 {{ISBN|0-664-25703-8}} p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''An introduction to the New Testament and the origins of Christianity'' by Delbert Royce Burkett 2002 {{ISBN|0-521-00720-8}} p. 485&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andreas Köstenberger]] and separately [[Robert E. Van Voorst]] state that the tone of the passage towards Christians is far too negative to have been authored by a Christian scribe – a conclusion shared by [[John P. Meier]]&lt;ref name=VVoorst39 &gt;Robert E. Van Voorst, ''Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence'', Wm. B. Eerdmans, 2000. pp. 39–53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' by Andreas J. Köstenberger, L. Scott Kellum 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4365-3}} p. 109–110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meier, John P., [[John P. Meier#A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus|''A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus]], Doubleday: 1991. vol 1: pp. 168–171.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert E. Van Voorst]] states that "of all Roman writers, Tacitus gives us the most precise information about Christ".&lt;ref name=VVoorst39 /&gt;

[[John Dominic Crossan]] considers the passage important in establishing that Jesus existed and was crucified, and states: "That he was crucified is as sure as anything historical can ever be, since both Josephus and Tacitus... agree with the Christian accounts on at least that basic fact."&lt;ref&gt;Crossan, John Dominic (1995). Jesus: A Revolutionary Biography. HarperOne. {{ISBN|0-06-061662-8}} p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bart D. Ehrman]] states: "Tacitus's report confirms what we know from other sources, that Jesus was executed by order of the Roman governor of Judea, Pontius Pilate, sometime during Tiberius's reign."&lt;ref name = "Ehrman-212"&gt;Ehrman p 212&lt;/ref&gt; Eddy and Boyd state that it is now "firmly established" that Tacitus provides a non-Christian confirmation of the crucifixion of Jesus.&lt;ref name=EddyB127&gt;Eddy, Paul; Boyd, Gregory (2007). ''The Jesus Legend: A Case for the Historical Reliability of the Synoptic Jesus Tradition'' Baker Academic, {{ISBN|0-8010-3114-1}} p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the majority of scholars consider it to be genuine, a few scholars question the authenticity of the passage given that Tacitus was born 25&amp;nbsp;years after Jesus' death.&lt;ref name=VVoorst39 /&gt;

Some scholars have debated the historical value of the passage given that Tacitus does not reveal the source of his information.&lt;ref&gt;F.F. Bruce,''Jesus and Christian Origins Outside the New Testament'', (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1974) p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerd Theissen]] and Annette Merz argue that Tacitus at times had drawn on earlier historical works now lost to us, and he may have used official sources from a Roman archive in this case; however, if Tacitus had been copying from an official source, some scholars would expect him to have labeled Pilate correctly as a ''prefect'' rather than a ''procurator''.&lt;ref&gt;Theissen and Merz p.83&lt;/ref&gt; Theissen and Merz state that Tacitus gives us a description of widespread prejudices about Christianity and a few precise details about "Christus" and Christianity, the source of which remains unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Theissen, Gerd |author2=Merz, Annette | title=The historical Jesus: a comprehensive guide |url = https://books.google.com/?id=3ZU97DQMH6UC&amp;pg=PA83| year=1998 | publisher=Fortress Press | location=Minneapolis  | isbn=978-0-8006-3122-2 | page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Paul R. Eddy has stated that given his position as a senator Tacitus was also likely to have had access to official Roman documents of the time and did not need other sources.&lt;ref name=Eddy181 &gt;''The Jesus legend: a case for the historical reliability of the synoptic gospels'' by Paul R. Eddy, et al 2007 {{ISBN|0-8010-3114-1}} pp. 181–183&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Martin notes that the authenticity of this passage of the Annals has also been disputed on the grounds that Tacitus would not have used the word “messiah” in an authentic Roman document.&lt;ref&gt;The Case Against Christianity, By Michael Martin, pp. 50–51, at https://books.google.com/books?id=wWkC4dTmK0AC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=historicity+of+jesus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o-_8U5-yEtTH7AbBpoCoAg&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=tacitus&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Weaver notes that Tacitus spoke of the persecution of Christians, but no other Christian author wrote of this persecution for a hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;The Historical Jesus in the Twentieth Century: 1900–1950, By Walter P.

Hotema notes that this passage was not quoted by any Church father up to the 15th century, although the passage would have been very useful to them in their work;&lt;ref name="books.google.co.za"&gt;Secret of Regeneration, By Hilton Hotema, p. 100, at https://books.google.com/books?id=jCaopp3R5B0C&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=interpolations+in+tacitus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CRf-U9-VGZCe7AbxrIDQCA&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwATge#v=onepage&amp;q=interpolations%20in%20tacitus&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; and that the passage refers to the Christians in Rome being a multitude, while at that time the Christian congregation in Rome would actually have been very small.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.za"/&gt;

[[Richard Carrier]] has put forward the ideas that the 'Christ, the author of this name, was executed by the procurator Pontius Pilate in the reign of Tiberius' line is a Christian interpolation and that Tacitus wrote about Chrestians not Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Carrier, Richard (2014) "The Prospect of a Christian Interpolation in Tacitus, Annals 15.44" ''Vigiliae Christianae'', Volume 68, Issue 3, pp. 264–283 (an earlier and more detailed version appears in Carrier's ''Hitler Homer Bible Christ'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carrier, Richard (2014) ''On the Historicity of Jesus'' Sheffield Phoenix Press {{ISBN|978-1-909697-49-2}} p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have also debated the issue of hearsay in the reference by Tacitus. Charles Guignebert argued that "So long as there is that possibility [that Tacitus is merely echoing what Christians themselves were saying], the passage remains quite worthless".&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus'', University Books, New York, 1956, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; R. T. France states that the Tacitus passage is at best just Tacitus repeating what he had heard through Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|authorlink=R. T. France|last=France|first=R.

[[File:Suetonius Lives of the Twelve Caesars 1540.jpg|thumb|150px|A 1540 copy of ''[[The Twelve Caesars|Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]'' by Suetonius ]]
The [[Roman historiography|Roman historian]] [[Suetonius]] (c. 69 – after 122 CE) made references to [[early Christianity|early Christians]] and their leader in his work ''[[The Twelve Caesars|Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]'' (written 121 CE).&lt;ref name="Cradle110"/&gt;&lt;ref name=lives &gt;''Lives of the Caesars'' by Suetonius, Catharine Edwards 2001 {{ISBN|0192832719}} pp. 184. 203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BCCrossan3 &gt;''Birth of Christianity'' by John Dominic Crossan 1999 {{ISBN|0567086682}} pp. 3–10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vvorst29 &gt;Robert E. Van Voorst, ''Jesus outside the New Testament: an introduction to the ancient evidence'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2000. pp. 29–39&lt;/ref&gt; The references appear in [[s:The Lives of the Twelve Caesars/Claudius#25|Claudius 25]] and [[s:The Lives of the Twelve Caesars/Nero#16|Nero 16]] which describe the lives of [[Roman Emperor]]s [[Claudius]] and [[Nero]].&lt;ref name=lives /&gt; The Nero 16 passage refers to the abuses by Nero and mentions how he inflicted punishment on Christians – which is generally dated to around AD 64.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of the Roman Empire'' by Matthew Bunson 1994 {{ISBN|081602135X}} p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; This passage shows the clear contempt of Suetonius for Christians - the same contempt expressed by [[Tacitus]] and [[Pliny the younger]] in their writings, but does not refer to Jesus himself.&lt;ref name=BCCrossan3 /&gt;

The earlier passage in Claudius, may include a reference to Jesus, but is subject to debate among scholars.&lt;ref name=vvorst29 /&gt; In [[s:The Lives of the Twelve Caesars/Claudius#25|Claudius 25]] Suetonius refers to the expulsion of Jews by Claudius and states:&lt;ref name=lives /&gt;

:"Since the Jews constantly made disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus, he expelled them from Rome."

The reference in Claudius 25 involves the agitations in the Jewish community which led to the expulsion of some Jews from Rome by Claudius, and is likely the same event mentioned in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#18:2|18:2]]).&lt;ref name=Cradle110 /&gt; Most historians date this expulsion to around AD 49–50.&lt;ref name=Cradle110 /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated18"&gt;''Christianity and the Roman Empire: background texts'' by Ralph Martin Novak 2001 {{ISBN|1-56338-347-0}} pp. 18–22&lt;/ref&gt; Suetonius refers to the leader of the Christians as ''Chrestus'', a term also used by [[Tacitus on Christ|used by Tacitus]], referred in Latin dictionaries as a (amongst other things) version of 'Christus'.&lt;ref name=France42 &gt;R. T. France. The Evidence for Jesus. (2006). Regent College Publishing {{ISBN|1-57383-370-3}}. p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; However, the wording used by Suetonius implies that Chrestus was alive at the time of the disturbance and was agitating the Jews in Rome.&lt;ref name=Dunn141&gt;''Jesus Remembered'' by James D. G. Dunn 2003 {{ISBN|0-8028-3931-2}} pp. 141–143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cradle110 /&gt; This weakens the historical value of his reference as a whole, and there is no overall scholarly agreement about its value as a reference to Jesus.&lt;ref name=Dunn141/&gt;&lt;ref name=vvorst29/&gt; However, the confusion of Suetonius also points to the lack of Christian interpolation, for a Christian scribe would not have confused the Jews with Christians.&lt;ref name=Dunn141/&gt;&lt;ref name=vvorst29/&gt;

Most scholars assume that in the reference Jesus is meant and that the disturbances mentioned were due to the [[Early centers of Christianity#Rome|spread of Christianity in Rome]].&lt;ref name=vvorst29/&gt;&lt;ref name=Feldman332&gt;Louis H.

[[File:Codex Reuchlin 2 96v.jpg|thumb|170px|A page from ''[[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin]]'' in the 12th century Reuchlin Codex [[Talmud]]]]
The Babylonian [[Talmud]] in a few cases includes possible references to Jesus using the terms "Yeshu", "Yeshu ha-Notzri", "ben Stada", and "ben Pandera". Some of these references probably date back to the [[Tannaim|Tannaitic period]] (70–200 CE).&lt;ref name=Blom280/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kellum107 &gt;Kostenberger, Andreas J.; Kellum, L. Scott; Quarles, Charles L. (2009). ''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' {{ISBN|0-8054-4365-7}}. pp. 107–109&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, it is not clear if the references are to Jesus, or other people, and scholars continue to debate their historical value, and exactly which references, if any, may be to Jesus.&lt;ref name=BEddy170&gt;Eddy, Paul; Boyd, Gregory (2007). ''The Jesus Legend: A Case for the Historical Reliability of the Synoptic Jesus Tradition'' {{ISBN|0-8010-3114-1}} pp. 170–174&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Theissen, Gerd, Annette Merz, ''The historical Jesus: a comprehensive guide'', Fortress Press, 1998 pp. 72–76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Blackwell Companion to Jesus'' by Delbert Burkett 2010 {{ISBN|140519362X}} p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Van Voorst]] states that the scarcity of Jewish references to Jesus is not surprising, given that Jesus was not a prominent issue for the Jews during the first century, and after the devastation caused by the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Siege of Jerusalem]] in the year 70, Jewish scholars were focusing on preserving [[Judaism]] itself, rather than paying much attention to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Van Voorst, Robert E. (2000). ''Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence'' Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.. {{ISBN|0-8028-4368-9}} pp. 129–130&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Eisenman argues that the derivation of Jesus of Nazareth from "ha-Notzri" is impossible on etymological grounds, as it would suggest rather "the [[Nazirite]]" rather than "the Nazarene".&lt;ref&gt;Einsenman, Robert (2002), "James; the Brother of Jesus" (Watkins)&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Voorst states that although the question of who was referred to in various points in the Talmud remains subject to debate among scholars, in the case of ''[[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin 43a]]'' (generally considered the most important reference to Jesus in rabbinic literature), Jesus can be confirmed as the subject of the passage, not only from the reference itself, but from the context that surrounds it, and there is little doubt that it refers to the death of Jesus of Nazareth.&lt;ref name=Leslie693&gt;In ''Jesus: The Complete Guide'' edited by J. L. Houlden (2006) {{ISBN|082648011X}} pp. 693–694&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Voorst117118&gt;Van Voorst, Robert E. (2000). ''Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence'' Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.. {{ISBN|0-8028-4368-9}} p. 177–118&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher M. Tuckett]] states that if it is accepted that death narrative of Sanhedrin 43a refers to Jesus of Nazareth then it provides evidence of Jesus' existence and execution.&lt;ref&gt;In ''The Cambridge Companion to Jesus'' by Markus N. A. Bockmuehl 2001 {{ISBN|0521796784}} p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andreas Kostenberger]] states that the passage is a [[Tannaitic]] reference to the trial and death of Jesus at Passover and is most likely earlier than other references to Jesus in the Talmud.&lt;ref name=Kellum107 /&gt; The passage reflects hostility toward Jesus among the rabbis and includes this text:&lt;ref name=Blom280&gt;''Jesus and the Gospels: An Introduction and Survey'' by Craig L. Blomberg (1 Aug 2009) {{ISBN|0805444823}} p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kellum107 /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is taught: On the eve of Passover they hung Yeshu and the crier went forth for forty days beforehand declaring that "[Yeshu] is going to be stoned for practicing witchcraft, for enticing and leading Israel astray. Anyone who knows something to clear him should come forth and exonerate him." But no one had anything exonerating for him and they hung him on the eve of Passover.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''[[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin]]'' 43a.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Peter Schäfer]] states that there can be no doubt that the narrative of the execution of Jesus in the Talmud refers to Jesus of Nazareth, but states that the rabbinic literature in question are not [[Tannaitic]] but from a later [[Amoraic]] period and may have drawn on the Christian gospels, and may have been written as responses to them.&lt;ref name=PeterS141&gt;''Jesus in the Talmud'' by Peter Schäfer (2009) {{ISBN|0691143188}} pp. 141&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bart Ehrman]] and separately Mark Allan Powell state that given that the Talmud references are quite late, they can give no historically reliable information about the teachings or actions of Jesus during his life.&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium'' by Bart Ehrman 2001 {{ISBN|019512474X}} p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus as a Figure in History: How Modern Historians View the Man from Galilee'' by Mark Allan Powell (1998) {{ISBN|0664257038}} p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reference in early second century Rabbinic literature ([[Tosefta|Tosefta Hullin]] II 22) refers to Rabbi Eleazar ben Dama who was bitten by a snake, but was denied healing in the name of Jesus by another Rabbi for it was against the law, and thus died.&lt;ref name=Bammel393/&gt; This passage reflects the attitude of Jesus' early Jewish opponents, i.e. that his miracles were based on evil powers.&lt;ref name=Bammel393&gt;''Jesus and the Politics of his Day'' by E. Bammel and C. F. D. Moule (1985) {{ISBN|0521313449}} p. 393&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kee71&gt;''The Beginnings of Christianity'' by Howard Clark Kee (2005) {{ISBN|0567027414}} p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

Eddy and Boyd, who question the value of several of the Talmudic references state that the significance of the Talmud to historical Jesus research is that it never denies the existence of Jesus, but accuses him of sorcery, thus indirectly confirming his existence.&lt;ref name=BEddy170/&gt; [[R. T. France]] and separately Edgar V. McKnight state that the divergence of the Talmud statements from the Christian accounts and their negative nature indicate that they are about a person who existed.&lt;ref&gt;R. T. France ''The Evidence for Jesus'' 2006 {{ISBN|1573833703}} p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus Christ in History and Scripture'' by Edgar V. McKnight 1999 {{ISBN|0865546770}} pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; Craig Blomberg states that the denial of the existence of Jesus was never part of the Jewish tradition, which instead accused him of being a sorcerer and magician, as also reflected in other sources such as [[Celsus]].&lt;ref name=Blom280/&gt; [[Andreas Kostenberger]] states that the overall conclusion that can be drawn from the references in the Talmud is that Jesus was a historical person whose existence was never denied by the Jewish tradition, which instead focused on discrediting him.&lt;ref name=Kellum107 /&gt;

===Minor sources===
{{Main article|Pliny the Younger on Christians|Dead Sea Scrolls}}

'''[[Pliny the Younger]]''' (c. 61 – c. 112), the provincial governor of [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]] and [[Bithynia]], wrote to [[Trajan|Emperor Trajan]] ''c''. 112 [[Pliny the Younger on Christians|concerning how to deal with Christians]], who refused to [[Imperial cult (Ancient Rome)|worship the emperor]], and instead worshiped "Christus". Charles Guignebert, who does not doubt that Jesus of the Gospels lived in Gallilee in the 1st century, nevertheless dismisses this letter as acceptable evidence for a historical Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Jesus, by Ch. Gugnebert, Translated from the French by S. H. Hooke, University Book, New York, 1956, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Thallus (historian)|Thallus]]''', of whom very little is known, and none of whose writings survive, wrote a history allegedly around the middle to late first century CE, to which [[Eusebius]] referred. [[Sextus Julius Africanus|Julius Africanus]], writing ''c'' 221, links a reference in the third book of the ''History'' to the period of darkness described in the crucifixion accounts in three of the Gospels .&lt;ref name=Eddy122 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julius Africanus, ''Extant Writings'' XVIII in ''Ante-Nicene Fathers'', ed. A. Roberts and J. Donaldson (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1973) vol. VI, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known whether Thallus made any mention to the crucifixion accounts; if he did, it would be the earliest noncanonical reference to a gospel episode, but its usefulness in determining the historicity of Jesus is uncertain.&lt;ref name=Eddy122 &gt;Eddy, Paul; Boyd, Gregory (2007). ''The Jesus Legend: A Case for the Historical Reliability of the Synoptic Jesus Tradition''. {{ISBN|0-8010-3114-1}} pp. 122–126&lt;/ref&gt; The dating of Thallus is dependent on him writing about an event during the 207th Olympiad (49–52 AD), which means he wrote after that date, not near that date. This depends on the text being corrupt, which would mean Thallus could have been writing after the 217th Olympiad (89–92 AD), or even the 167th Olympiad (112–109 BC). He is first referenced by Theophilus, writing around 180 AD, which means Thallus could have written any time between 109 BC and 180 AD.  All we know is Thallus mentioned a solar eclipse, and as solar eclipses are not possible at Passover, that would mean Thallus was not talking about the crucifixion of Jesus at all.&lt;ref&gt;http://infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/thallus.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Phlegon of Tralles]]''', AD 80–140, similar to Thallus, Julius Africanus mentions a historian named Phlegon who wrote a chronicle of history around AD 140, where he records:
“Phlegon records that, in the time of Tiberius Caesar, at full moon, there was a full eclipse of the sun from the sixth to the ninth hour.” (Africanus, Chronography, 18:1)  Phlegon is also mentioned by Origen (an early church theologian and scholar, born in Alexandria):
“Now Phlegon, in the thirteenth or fourteenth book, I think, of his Chronicles, not only ascribed to Jesus a knowledge of future events . . . but also testified that the result corresponded to His predictions.” (Origen Against Celsus, Book 2, Chapter 14)
“And with regard to the eclipse in the time of Tiberius Caesar, in whose reign Jesus appears to have been crucified, and the great earthquakes which then took place … ” (Origen Against Celsus, Book 2, Chapter 33)
“Jesus, while alive, was of no assistance to himself, but that he arose after death, and exhibited the marks of his punishment, and showed how his hands had been pierced by nails.” (Origen Against Celsus, Book 2, Chapter 59).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/origen162.html see book 2, chapter 33 and 59&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Eusebius in The Chronicon (written in the 4th century AD) records what Phlegon said verbatim. "Now, in the fourth year of the 202nd Olympiad [32 AD], a great eclipse of the sun occurred at the sixth hour [noon] that excelled every other before it, turning the day into such darkness of night that the stars could be seen in heaven, and the earth moved in Bithynia, toppling many buildings in the city of Nicaea." Phlegon never mentions Jesus or the 3 hour darkness.  He also mentions a solar eclipse, which can not occur at Passover. Apart from the year (which may be a corruption), this description fits an earthquake and eclipse that occurred in North West Turkey on November, 29 AD.&lt;ref&gt;http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEsearch/SEsearchmap.php?Ecl=00291124&lt;/ref&gt;

While the statements of Celsus may be seen as valuable, they have little historical value, given that the wording of the original writings can not be examined.&lt;ref name=Voorst6568&gt;Van Voorst, Robert E.

Eerdmans Publishing, 2000. pp 58–64&lt;/ref&gt; Given that Lucian's understanding of Christian traditions has significant gaps and errors, his writing is unlikely to have been influenced by Christians themselves, and he may provide an independent statement about the crucifixion of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Eddy122 /&gt; However, given the nature of the text as satire, Lucian may have embellished the stories he heard and his account cannot have a high degree of historical reliability.&lt;ref name="Robert E.

* [[Trajan|Emperor Trajan]] (c. 53–117), in reply to a letter sent by [[Pliny the Younger]], wrote "You observed proper procedure, my dear Pliny, in sifting the cases of those who had been denounced to you as Christians. For it is not possible to lay down any general rule to serve as a kind of fixed standard. They are not to be sought out; if they are denounced and proved guilty, they are to be punished, with this reservation, that whoever denies that he is a Christian and really proves it—that is, by worshiping our gods—even though he was under suspicion in the past, shall obtain pardon through repentance. But anonymously posted accusations ought to have no place in any prosecution. For this is both a dangerous kind of precedent and out of keeping with the spirit of our age."
* [[Epictetus]] (AD 55–135) provides another possible yet disputed reference to Christians as "Galileans" in his "Discourses" 4.7.6 and 2.9.19–21: "Therefore, if madness can produce this attitude [of detachment] toward these things [death, loss of family, property], and also habit, as with the Galileans, can no one learn from reason and demonstration that God has made all things in the universe, and the whole universe itself, to be unhindered and complete in itself, and the parts of it to serve the needs of the whole."
* [[Numenius of Apamea]], in the second century, wrote a possible allusion to Christians and Christ that is contained in fragments of his treatises on the points of divergence between the Academicians and Plato, on the Good (in which according to Origen, Contra Celsum, iv. 51, he makes an allusion to Jesus Christ).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/origen164.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is listed in De libris propriis 5, and seems to belong between 176–192 AD, or possibly even 176–180: "One might more easily teach novelties to the followers of Moses and Christ than to the physicians and philosophers who cling fast to their schools"&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=NmZ7Q1-8QkEC&amp;pg=PA274&amp;lpg=PA274&amp;dq=One+might+more+easily+teach+novelties+to+the+followers+of+Moses+and+Christ+than+to+the+physicians+and+philosophers+who+cling+fast+to+their+schools&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Iu54l5PSMP&amp;sig=Q8nlSJJRzBzUrAgqCeupkpIHjP8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwic_umTobXPAhVGw2MKHe7sAU0Q6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=One%20might%20more%20easily%20teach%20novelties%20to%20the%20followers%20of%20Moses%20and%20Christ%20than%20to%20the%20physicians%20and%20philosophers%20who%20cling%20fast%20to%20their%20schools&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

====James Ossuary====
{{Main article|James Ossuary}}
There is a limestone burial box from the 1st century known as the [[James Ossuary]] with the Aramaic inscription, "James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus."  The authenticity of the inscription was challenged by the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]], who filed a complaint with the Israeli police. In 2012, the owner of the ossuary was found not guilty, with the judge ruling that the authenticity of the ossuary inscription had not been proven either way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Lorenzi, Rossella | title = Trial Does Not Settle 'Brother of Jesus' Controversy | work = Discovery News | date = March 14, 2012 | url = http://news.discovery.com/history/archaeology/james-ossuary-120314.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested it was a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ayalon, A., Bar-Matthews, M., &amp; Goren, Y. | year = 2004 | title = Authenticity examination of the inscription on the ossuary attributed to James, brother of Jesus | journal = Journal of Archaeological Science | volume = 31 | issue = 8 | pages = 1185–1189 | doi=10.1016/j.jas.2004.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian sources==
Various books, memoirs and stories were written about Jesus by the early Christians. The most famous are the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. All but one of these are believed to have been written within 50–70 years of the death of Jesus, with the [[Gospel of Mark]] believed to be the earliest, and the last the [[Gospel of John]].&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; pp. xix–xx, 46–47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mack, Burton L. (1996)"Who Wrote the New Testament: the making of a Christian Myth"(Harper One)&lt;/ref&gt; Blainey writes that the oldest surviving record written by an early Christian is a short letter by [[St Paul]]: the [[First Epistle to the Thessalonians]], which appeared about 25 years after the death of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; This letter, while important in describing issues for the development of Gentilic Christianity, contains little of significance for understanding the life of the historic Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Buetz, Jeffrey J.(2005), "The Brother of Jesus and the Lost Teachings of Christianity".(Inner Traditions)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bart Ehrman]], [[Robert Eisenman]] and others critical of traditional Christian views, in assessing the problems involved in conducting historical Jesus research, say the Gospels are full of discrepancies, were written decades after Jesus' death, by authors who had not witnessed any events in Jesus' life. They go on to say the Gospels were authored not by eyewitnesses who were contemporary with the events that they narrate but rather by people who did not know Jesus, see anything he did, or hear anything he taught, and that the authors did not even share a language with Jesus. The accounts they produced are not disinterested; they are narratives produced by Christians who actually believed in Jesus, and were not immune from slanting the stories in light of their biases. Ehrman points out that the texts are widely inconsistent, full of discrepancies and contradictions in both details and larger portraits of who Jesus was.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrman, Bart D. (2010), "Jesus, Interrupted: Revealing the Hidden Contradictions in the Bible (And Why We Don't Know About Them)" (Harper One 1 Reprint edition (2 February 2010)). pp. 143–144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Einsenman, Robert (2002), "james, the Brother of Jesus: The Key to Unlocking the Secrets of Early Christianity and the Dead Sea Scrolls" (Watkins)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pauline epistles===
{{Main article|Pauline epistles}}

====Overview====
[[File:P46.jpg|thumb|150px|A page from [[2 Corinthians]] in [[Papyrus 46]], c. AD 200]]
In the context of Christian sources, even if all other texts are ignored, the [[Pauline epistles]] can provide some information regarding Jesus.&lt;ref name="Tuckett126"/&gt;&lt;ref name=McK38 /&gt; This information does not include a narrative of the life of Jesus, and refers to his existence as a person, but adds few specific items apart from his death by crucifixion.&lt;ref name=Furnish43&gt;Victor Furnish in ''Paul and Jesus'' edited by Alexander J. M. Wedderburn 2004 (Academic Paperback) {{ISBN|0567083969}} pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; This information comes from those letters of Paul whose authenticity is not disputed.&lt;ref name=McK38&gt;''Jesus Christ in History and Scripture'' by Edgar V. McKnight 1999 {{ISBN|0865546770}} p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Paul was not a companion of Jesus and claims his information comes from the holy spirit acquired after Jesus' death.&lt;ref&gt;From Jesus to Christianity, San Francisco: HarperCollins, 2004 p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the thirteen letters that bear Paul's name, seven are considered authentic by almost all scholars, and the others are generally considered [[Pseudepigraphy|pseudepigraphic]].&lt;ref name=EerdDunn&gt;''Eerdmans Commentary on the Bible'' by James D. G. Dunn (19 Nov 2003) {{ISBN|0802837115}} p. 1274 "There is general scholarly agreement that seven of the thirteen letters beariing Pau's name are authentic, but his authorship of the other six cannot be taken for granted... Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, 1 Thessalonians and Philomen are certainly Paul's own."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aune9&gt;''The Blackwell Companion to The New Testament'' by David E. Aune {{ISBN|1405108258}} p. 9 "... seven of the letters attributed to Paul are almost universally accepted as authentic (Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, 1 Thessalonians, Philomen)..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Perkins4 &gt;Pheme Perkins, ''Reading the New Testament: An Introduction'' (Paulist Press, 1988), {{ISBN|0809129396}} pp. 4–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams94/&gt; The 7 undisputed letters (and their approximate dates) are: [[1 Thessalonians]] (c. 51 CE), [[Philippians]] (c. 52–54 CE), [[Epistle to Philemon|Philemon]] (c. 52–54 CE), [[1 Corinthians]] (c. 53–54 CE), [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] (c. 55 CE), [[2 Corinthians]] (c. 55–56 CE) and [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] (c. 55–58 CE).&lt;ref name=EerdDunn/&gt;&lt;ref name=Perkins4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams94/&gt; The authenticity of these letters is accepted by almost all scholars, and they have been referenced and interpreted by early authors such as [[Origen]] and [[Eusebius]].&lt;ref name=Aune9/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gorday&gt;Peter Gorday in ''Eusebius, Christianity, and Judaism'' by Harold W. Attridge 1992 {{ISBN|0814323618}} pp. 139–141&lt;/ref&gt;

Given that the Pauline epistles are generally dated to AD 50 to AD 60, they are the earliest surviving Christian texts that include information about Jesus.&lt;ref name=Adams94/&gt; These letters were written approximately twenty to thirty years after the generally accepted time period for the death of Jesus, around AD 30–36.&lt;ref name=Adams94/&gt; The letters were written during a time when Paul recorded encounters with the disciples of Jesus, e.g. [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Galatians#1:18|Galatians 1:18]] states that several years after his conversion Paul went to Jerusalem and stayed with Apostle Peter for fifteen days.&lt;ref name=Adams94&gt;Edward Adams "Paul, Jesus and Christ" in ''The Blackwell Companion to Jesus'' edited by Delbert Burkett 2010 {{ISBN|140519362X}} pp. 94–96&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Paul disputed the nature of Jesus' message with Jesus's brother James, concerning the importance of adhering to kosher food restrictions and circumcision, important features of determining Jewish identity.&lt;ref&gt;Buetz, Jeffrey (op cit)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eisenman, Robert (op cit)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pauline letters were not intended to provide a narrative of the life of Jesus, but were written as expositions of Christian teachings.&lt;ref name=Adams94/&gt;&lt;ref name=JRDunn143/&gt; In Paul's view, the earthly life of Jesus was of a lower importance than the theology of his death and resurrection,a theme that permeates Pauline writings.&lt;ref name=DunnPaul&gt;James D. G. Dunn "Paul's understanding of the death of Jesus" in ''Sacrifice and Redemption'' edited by S. W. Sykes (2007) Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|052104460X}} pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Pauline letters clearly indicate that for Paul Jesus was a real person (born of a woman as in Gal 4.4), a Jew ("born under the law", Romans 1.3) who had disciples (1 Corinthians 15.5), who was crucified (as in 1 Corinthians 2.2 and Galatians 3.1) and who resurrected from the dead (1 Corinthians 15.20, Romans 1.4 and 6.5, Philippians 3:10–11).&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=McK38/&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams94/&gt;&lt;ref name=DunnPaul /&gt; And the letters reflect the general concept within the early Gentillic Christian Church that Jesus existed, was crucified and was raised from the dead.&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams94/&gt;

The references by Paul to Jesus do not in themselves prove the existence of Jesus, but they do establish that the existence of Jesus was the accepted norm within the early Christians (including the Christian community in Jerusalem, given the references to collections there) twenty to thirty years after the death of Jesus, at a time when those who could have been acquainted with him could still be alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus and the Gospels: An Introduction and Survey'' by Craig L. Blomberg 2009 {{ISBN|0805444823}} pp. 441–442&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Theology: A Concise Sacramentum Mundi'' by Karl Rahner 2004 {{ISBN|0860120066}} p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

====Specific references====
The seven Pauline epistles that are widely regarded as authentic include the following information that along with other historical elements are used to study the historicity of Jesus:&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=McK38/&gt;

[[File:Papyrus 27.png|thumb|110px|Early 3rd century copy of [[Epistle to the Romans]] from [[Papyrus 27]]]]
* ''Existence of Jesus'': That in Paul's view Jesus existed and was a Jew is based on [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Galatians#4:4|Galatians 4:4]] which states that he was "born of a woman" and [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Romans#1:3|Romans 1:3]] that he was "born under the law".&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=McK38/&gt;&lt;ref name=Furnish19/&gt; Some scholars such as [[Paul Barnett (bishop)|Paul Barnett]] hold that this indicates that Paul had some familiarity with the circumstances of the birth of Jesus, but that is not shared among scholars in general.&lt;ref name=JRDunn143&gt;''Jesus Remembered: Christianity in the Making'' by James D. G. Dunn (2003) {{ISBN|0802839312}} p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Barn95&gt;''Jesus &amp; the Rise of Early Christianity: A History of New Testament Times'' by Paul Barnett 2002 {{ISBN|0830826998}} pp. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt; However, the statement does indicate that Paul had some knowledge of and interest in Jesus' life before his crucifixion.&lt;ref name=JRDunn143/&gt;
* ''Disciples and brothers'': [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#15:5|
1 Corinthians 15:5]] states that Paul knew that Jesus had 12 disciples, and considers Peter as one of them.&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=Furnish19/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Paul and Scripture'' by Steve Moyise (1 Jul 2010) {{ISBN|080103924X}} p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#1:12|1 Corinthians 1:12]] further indicates that Peter was known in [[Corinth]] before the writing of [[1 Corinthians]], for it assumes that they were familiar with Cephas/Peter.&lt;ref&gt;''Paul, Antioch and Jerusalem'' by Nicholas Taylor 1991 {{ISBN|1850753318}} p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VernK74&gt;''The Tapestry of Early Christian Discourse'' by Vernon K. Robbins (1996) {{ISBN|0415139988}} pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt; The statement in 1 Corinthians 15:5 indicates that "the twelve" as a reference to the [[twelve apostles]] was a generally known notion within the early Christian Church in Corinth and required no further explanation from Paul.&lt;ref name=JRDunn507&gt;''Jesus Remembered: Christianity in the Making'' by James D. G. Dunn (2003) {{ISBN|0802839312}} p. 507&lt;/ref&gt; [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Galatians#1:18|Galatians 1:18]] further states that Paul personally knew Peter and stayed with him in Jerusalem for fifteen days, about three years after his conversion.&lt;ref name=MateraGal65&gt;''Galatians'' by Frank J. Matera 2007 {{ISBN|0814659721}} p. 65–66&lt;/ref&gt; It also implies that Peter was already known to the Galatians and required no introduction.&lt;ref&gt;''Galatians'' by Martinus C. de Boer 2011 {{ISBN|0664221238}} p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#9:5|1 Corinthians 9:5]] and [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Galatians#1:19|Galatians 1:19]] state that Jesus had brothers, one being called James, whom Paul met or "saw."&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=Furnish43/&gt;&lt;ref name=Furnish19/&gt; James was claimed by early Christian writers as Origen and Eusebius to have been the leader of the followers of Jesus, after his brother's death, and to have been the first bishop, or [[archbishop|bishop of bishops]] in Jerusalem.
* ''Betrayal and rituals'': That Jesus was betrayed and established some traditions such as the [[Eucharist]] are derived from [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#11:23|1 Corinthians 11:23–25]] which states: "The Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread; and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me.".&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=Furnish19/&gt;
* ''Crucifixion'': The Pauline letters include several references to the crucifixion of Jesus e.g. [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#11:23|
1 Corinthians 11:23]], [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#2:2|
1 Corinthians 2:2]] and [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Galatians#3:1|
Galatians 3:1]] among others.&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=Furnish19/&gt; The death of Jesus forms a central element of the Pauline letters.&lt;ref name=DunnPaul/&gt; [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Thessalonians#2:15|1 Thessalonians 2:15]] places the responsibility for the death of Jesus on some Jews.&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=Furnish19/&gt; Moreover the statement in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Thessalonians#2:14|1 Thessalonians 2:14–16]] about the Jews "who both killed the Lord Jesus" and "drove out us" indicates that the death of Jesus was within the same time frame as the persecution of Paul.&lt;ref name=Eddy46&gt;''The Jesus legend: a case for the historical reliability of the synoptic gospels' by Paul R. Eddy, Gregory A. Boyd 2007 {{ISBN|0-8010-3114-1}} pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Burial'': [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#15:4|1 Corinthians 15:4]] and [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Romans#6:4|Romans 6:4]] state that following his death Jesus was [[empty tomb|buried]] (but does not mention a tomb).&lt;ref name=Furnish19&gt;''Jesus according to Paul'' by Victor Paul Furnish 1994 {{ISBN|0521458242}} pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; This reference is then used by Paul to build on the theology of resurrection, but reflects the common belief at the time that Jesus was buried after his death.&lt;ref&gt;''1 Corinthians'' by Richard Oster 1995 {{ISBN|0899006337}} p. 353&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Apostle Paul: His Life and Theology'' by Udo Schnelle (1 Nov 2005) {{ISBN|0801027969}} pp. 329–330&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of only these references to Jesus in the Pauline epistles has given rise to criticism of them by [[G. A. Wells]], who is generally accepted as a leader of the movement to deny the historicity of Jesus.&lt;ref name=WellsT49 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Casey39 /&gt; When Wells was still denying the existence of Jesus, he criticized the Pauline epistles for not mentioning items such as John the Baptist or Judas or the trial of Jesus and used that argument to conclude that Jesus was not a historical figure.&lt;ref name=WellsT49/&gt;&lt;ref name= Casey39&gt;'Jesus of Nazareth: An independent historian's account of his life and teaching'' by Maurice Casey pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Dunn29&gt;''The Evidence for Jesus'' by James D. G. Dunn (1986) {{ISBN|0664246982}} p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James D. G. Dunn]] addressed Wells' statement and stated that he knew of no other scholar that shared that view, and most other scholars had other and more plausible explanations for the fact that Paul did not include a narrative of the life of Jesus in his letters, which were primarily written as religious documents rather than historical chronicles at a time when the life story of Jesus could have been well known within the early Church.&lt;ref name= Dunn29 /&gt; Dunn states that despite Wells' arguments, the theories of the non-existence of Jesus are a "thoroughly dead thesis".&lt;ref name=DunnPaul /&gt;

While Wells no longer denies the existence of Jesus, he has responded to Dunn, stating that his [[arguments from silence]] not only apply to Paul but all early Christian authors, and that he still has a low opinion of early Christian texts, maintaining that for Paul Jesus may have existed a good number of decades before.&lt;ref name=WellsT49&gt;''Can We Trust the New Testament?'' by George Albert Wells 2003 {{ISBN|0812695674}} p. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pre-Pauline creeds====
{{Main article|Creed}}
The Pauline letters sometimes refer to creeds, or confessions of faith, that predate their writings.&lt;ref name=Kruse41 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BAune /&gt;&lt;ref name=RMartin57 &gt;''Worship in the Early Church'' by Ralph P. Martin 1975 {{ISBN|0802816134}} pp. 57–58&lt;/ref&gt; For instance [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#15:3|1 Corinthians 15:3–4]] reads: "For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures."&lt;ref name=Kruse41 &gt;''Paul's Letter to the Romans'' by Colin G. Kruse (2012) {{ISBN|0802837433}} pp. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Romans#1:3|Romans 1:3–4]] refers to Romans 1:2 just before it which mentions an existing gospel, and in effect may be treating it as an earlier creed.&lt;ref name=Kruse41 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BAune /&gt;

One of the keys to identifying a pre-Pauline tradition is given in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#15:11|1 Corinthians 15:11]]&lt;ref name=RMartin57 /&gt;

: Whether then [it be] I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.

Here Paul refers to others before him who preached the creed.&lt;ref name=RMartin57 /&gt; James Dunn states that [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#15:3|1 Corinthians 15:3]] indicates that in the 30s Paul was taught about the death of Jesus a few years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus Remembered: Christianity in the Making'', Volume 1 by James D. G. Dunn (2003) {{ISBN|0802839312}} pp. 142–143&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pauline letters thus contain Christian creed elements of pre-Pauline origin.&lt;ref&gt;Neufeld, ''The Earliest Christian Confessions'' (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1964) p. 47

* R. E. Brown, ''The Virginal Conception and Bodily Resurrection of Jesus'' (New York: Paulist Press, 1973) pp. 81, 92&lt;/ref&gt; The antiquity of the creed has been located by many Biblical scholars to less than a decade after Jesus' death, originating from the Jerusalem apostolic community.&lt;ref&gt;see Wolfhart Pannenberg, ''Jesus – God and Man'' translated Lewis Wilkins and Duane Pribe (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1968)p. 90; Oscar Cullmann, ''The Early church: Studies in Early Christian History and Theology'', ed. A. J. B. Higgins (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1966) p. 66–66; R. E. Brown, ''The Virginal Conception and Bodily Resurrection of Jesus'' (New York: Paulist Press, 1973) pp. 81; Thomas Sheehan, ''First Coming: How the Kingdom of God Became Christianity'' (New York: Random House, 1986 pp. 110, 118; Ulrich Wilckens, ''Resurrection'' translated A. M. Stewart (Edinburgh: Saint Andrew, 1977) p. 2; Hans Grass, ''Ostergeschen und Osterberichte'', Second Edition (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht, 1962) p. 96; Grass favors the origin in Damascus.&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning this creed, Campenhausen wrote, "This account meets all the demands of historical reliability that could possibly be made of such a text,"&lt;ref&gt;Hans von Campenhausen, "The Events of Easter and the Empty Tomb," in ''Tradition and Life in the Church'' (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1968) p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; whilst A. M. Hunter said, "The passage therefore preserves uniquely early and verifiable testimony. It meets every reasonable demand of historical reliability."&lt;ref&gt;Archibald Hunter, ''Works and Words of Jesus'' (1973) p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

These creeds date to within a few years of Jesus' death, and developed within the Christian community in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=Leith12 &gt;''Creeds of the Churches, Third Edition'' by John H. Leith (1982) {{ISBN|0804205264}} p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Although embedded within the texts of the New Testament, these creeds are a distinct source for [[Early Christianity]].&lt;ref name=BAune &gt;''The Blackwell Companion to The New Testament'' edited by David E. Aune 2010 {{ISBN|1405108258}} p. 424&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that existence and death of Jesus was part of Christian belief a few years after his death and over a decade before the writing of the Pauline epistles.&lt;ref name=Leith12 /&gt;

Blomberg 2009 {{ISBN|0-8054-4482-3}} pp. 441–442&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fahlbusch52 &gt;''The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 4'' by Erwin Fahlbusch, 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-8028-2416-5}} pp. 52–56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans465 &gt;The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary'' by Craig A. Evans 2003 {{ISBN|0-7814-3868-3}} pp. 465–477&lt;/ref&gt; Three of these (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) are known as the [[synoptic Gospels]], from the Greek σύν (syn "together") and ὄψις (opsis "view"), given that they display a high degree of similarity in content, narrative arrangement, language and paragraph structure.&lt;ref&gt;''New Testament Theology by Paul Haffner'' 2008 {{ISBN|88-902268-0-3}} p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Guide to the Gospels'' by W. Graham Scroggie 1995 {{ISBN|0-8254-3744-X}} p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; The presentation in the fourth canonical gospel, i.e. John, differs from these three in that it has more of a thematic nature rather than a narrative format.&lt;ref name=Moloney3 /&gt; Scholars generally agree that it is impossible to find any direct literary relationship between the synoptic gospels and the Gospel of John.&lt;ref name=Moloney3 &gt;''The Gospel of John'' by Francis J.

The authors of the New Testament generally showed little interest in an absolute [[chronology of Jesus]] or in synchronizing the episodes of his life with the secular history of the age.&lt;ref name=Rahner730 &gt;''Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi'' by [[Karl Rahner]] 2004 {{ISBN|0-86012-006-6}} pp. 730–731&lt;/ref&gt; The gospels were primarily written as theological documents in the context of [[early Christianity]] with the chronological timelines as a secondary consideration.&lt;ref name=Wiarda75 &gt;''Interpreting Gospel Narratives: Scenes, People, and Theology'' by Timothy Wiarda 2010 {{ISBN|0-8054-4843-8}} pp. 75–78&lt;/ref&gt; One manifestation of the gospels being theological documents rather than historical chronicles is that they devote about one third of their text to just seven days, namely the last week of the life of Jesus in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=Turner613 &gt;''Matthew'' by David L. Turner 2008 {{ISBN|0-8010-2684-9}} p. 613&lt;/ref&gt; Although the gospels do not provide enough details to satisfy the demands of modern historians regarding exact dates, scholars have used them to reconstruct a number of portraits of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Rahner730 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wiarda75 /&gt;&lt;ref name=sanders3&gt;Sanders, E. P. ''The historical figure of Jesus'' {{ISBN|0140144994}} Penguin, 1993. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; However, as stated in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#21:25|John 21:25]] the gospels do not claim to provide an exhaustive list of the events in the life of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Gerald3 &gt;''[[Christology: A Biblical, Historical, and Systematic Study of Jesus]]'' by [[Gerald O'Collins]] 2009 {{ISBN|0-19-955787-X}} pp. 1–3&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have varying degrees of certainty about the historical reliability of the accounts in the gospels, and the only two events whose historicity is the subject of almost universal agreement among scholars are the [[Baptism of Jesus|baptism]] and [[crucifixion of Jesus]].&lt;ref name=JDunn339/&gt; Scholars such as [[E.P. Sanders]] and separately [[Craig A. Evans]] go further and assume that two other events in the gospels are historically certain, namely that Jesus [[Twelve apostles|called disciples]], and caused a [[Cleansing of the Temple|controversy at the Temple]].&lt;ref name="Evans37"/&gt;

Ever since the [[Augustinian hypothesis]], scholars continue to debate the order in which the gospels were written, and how they may have influenced each other, and several hypothesis exist in that regard, e.g. the [[Markan priority]] hypothesis holds that the Gospel of Mark was written first c. 70 CE.&lt;ref&gt;''Eerdmans Commentary on the Bible'' edited by James D. G. Dunn (2003) {{ISBN|0802837115}} pp. 1064–1065&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Meier|first=John P.|authorlink=John P. Meier|title=A Marginal Jew|publisher=Doubleday|year=1991|location=New York City|pages=v.2 955–6|isbn=0-385-46993-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach, Matthew is placed at being sometime after this date and Luke is thought to have been written between 70 and 100 CE.&lt;ref name="Harris Gospels"&gt;[[Stephen L. Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. "The Gospels" pp. 266–268&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the competing, and more popular, [[Q source]] hypothesis, the gospels were not independently written, but were derived from a common source called Q.&lt;ref&gt;''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: Q–Z'' by Geoffrey W. Bromiley (1995) {{ISBN|0802837840}} pp. 1–3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New Testament: History, Literature, Religion'' by Gerd Theissen 2003 ISBN p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The [[two-source hypothesis]] then proposes that the authors of Matthew and Luke drew on the Gospel of Mark as well as on Q.&lt;ref&gt;''Three Views on the Origins of the Synoptic Gospels'' by Robert L. Thomas 2002 {{ISBN|0825438381}} p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The gospels can be seen as having three separate lines: A literary line which looks at it from a textual perspective, secondly a historical line which observes how Christianity started as a renewal movement within Judaism and eventually separated from it, and finally a theological line which analyzes Christian teachings.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Testament: History, Literature, Religion'' by Gerd Theissen 2003 ISBN p. x&lt;/ref&gt; Within the historical perspective, the gospels are not simply used to establish the existence of Jesus as sources in their own right alone, but their content is compared and contrasted to non-Christian sources, and the historical context, to draw conclusions about the historicity of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kellum104/&gt;&lt;ref name=Voorst7&gt;Van Voorst, Robert E. (2000). Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co. {{ISBN|0-8028-4368-9}} p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Church fathers===
[[File:Eusebius of Caesarea.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Eusebius of Caesarea]]]]
Two possible [[Church Fathers|patristic sources]] that may refer to eye witness encounters with Jesus are the early references of [[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]] and [[Quadratus of Athens|Quadratus]], reported by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] in the 4th century.&lt;ref name=Bauck15/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carr22/&gt;

The works of Papias have not survived, but [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] quotes him as saying:&lt;ref name=Bauck15&gt;Richard Bauckham ''Jesus and the Eyewitnesses'' (Eerdmans, 2006), {{ISBN|0802831621}} pp. 15–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"…if by chance anyone who had been in attendance on the elders should come my way, I inquired about the words of the elders – that is, what according to the elders Andrew or Peter said, or Philip, or Thomas or James, or John or Matthew or any other of the Lord’s disciples, and whatever Aristion and the elder John, the Lord’s disciples, were saying."

[[Richard Bauckham]] states that while Papias was collecting his information (c. 90), Aristion and the elder John (who were Jesus' disciples) were still alive and teaching in [[Asia minor]], and Papias gathered information from people who had known them.&lt;ref name=Bauck15/&gt; However, the exact identity of the "elder John" is wound up in the debate on the authorship of the [[Gospel of John]], and scholars have differing opinions on that, e.g. [[Jack Finegan]] states that Eusebius may have misunderstood what Papias wrote, and the elder John may be a different person from the author of the fourth gospel, yet still a disciple of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Finegan42 &gt;''The archeology of the New Testament'' by Jack Finegan (1981) {{ISBN|0709910061}} pp. 42–43&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gary Burge]], on the other hand sees confusion on the part of Eusebius and holds the elder John to be different person from the apostle John.&lt;ref&gt;''Interpreting the Gospel of John'' by [[Gary M. Burge]] (1998) {{ISBN|0801010217}} pp. 52–53&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter of Quadratus (possibly the first Christian apologist) to emperor [[Hadrian]] (who reigned 117 – 138) is likely to have an early date and is reported by [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] in his ''Ecclesiastical History'' 4.3.2 to have stated:&lt;ref&gt;''Eusebius: The Church History'' by Eusebius and Paul L. Maier (2007) {{ISBN|082543307X}} p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The words of our Savior were always present, for they were true: those who were healed, those who rose from the dead, those who were not only seen in the act of being healed or raised, but were also always present, not merely when the Savior was living on earth, but also for a considerable time after his departure, so that some of them survived even to our own times."&lt;ref name=Bauckham53 &gt;Richard Bauckham, ''Jesus and the Eyewitnesses'' (Cambridge: Eerdmans, 2006), pp. 53–54&lt;/ref&gt;

By "our Savior" Quadratus means Jesus and the letter is most likely written before AD 124.&lt;ref name=Carr22&gt;''The Early Christian Church: Volume 2, The Second Christian Century by Philip Carrington (2011) {{ISBN|0521157382}} pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; Bauckham states that by "our times" he may refer to his early life, rather than when he wrote (117–124), which would be a reference contemporary with Papias.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bauckham, ''Jesus and the Eyewitnesses'' (Cambridge: Eerdmans, 2006), p. 531.&lt;/ref&gt; Bauckham states that the importance of the statement attributed to Quadratus is that he emphasizes the "eye witness" nature of the testimonies to interaction with Jesus.&lt;ref name=Bauckham53 /&gt; Such "eye witness statements" abound in early Christian writings, particularly the [[pseudonymous]] Christian [[Apocrypha]], Gospels and Letters, in order to give them credibility.

===Apocryphal texts===
{{see also|Gnostic gospels|New Testament apocrypha}}
A number of later Christian texts, usually dating to the second century or later, exist as [[New Testament apocrypha]], among which the [[gnostic gospels]] have been of major recent interest among scholars.&lt;ref name=vvoorst215 &gt;Van Voorst, Robert E (2000). ''Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence''. Eerdmans Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8028-4368-9}} pp. 215–217&lt;/ref&gt; The 1945 discovery of the [[Nag Hammadi library]] created a significant amount of scholarly interest and many modern scholars have since studied the gnostic gospels and written about them.&lt;ref name=Keener52 /&gt; However, the trend among the 21st century scholars has been to accept that while the gnostic gospels may shed light on the progression of early Christian beliefs, they offer very little to contribute to the study of the historicity of Jesus, in that they are rather late writings, usually consisting of sayings (rather than narrative, similar to the hypothesised Q documents), their authenticity and authorship remain questionable, and various parts of them rely on components of the New Testament.&lt;ref name=Keener52 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BartProphet72/&gt; The focus of modern research into the historical Jesus has been away from gnostic writings and towards the comparison of Jewish, [[Greco-Roman]] and [[canonical gospel|canonical]] Christian sources.&lt;ref name=Keener52 &gt;''The Historical Jesus of the Gospels'' by Craig S. Keener 2012 {{ISBN|0802868886}} pp. 52–54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BartProphet72&gt;''Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium'' by Bart D. Ehrman 2001 {{ISBN|019512474X}} pp. 72–78&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, [[Bart Ehrman]] states that gnostic writings of the [[Gospel of Thomas]] (part of the Nag Hammadi library) have very little value in historical Jesus research, because the author of that gospel placed no importance on the physical experiences of Jesus (e.g. his crucifixion) or the physical existence of believers, and was only interested in the secret teachings of Jesus rather than any physical events.&lt;ref name=BartProphet72 /&gt; Similarly, the [[Apocryphon of John]] (also part of the Nag Hammadi library) has been useful in studying the prevailing attitudes in the second century, and questions of authorship regarding the [[Book of revelation]], given that it refers to [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Revelation#1|Revelation 1:19]], but is mostly about the [[Ascension of Jesus|post ascension]] teachings of Jesus in a vision, not a narrative of his life.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Revelation'' by [[Robert H. Mounce]] 1997 {{ISBN|0802825370}} p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars such as Edward Arnal contend that the Gospel of Thomas continues to remain useful for understanding how the teachings of Jesus were transmitted among early Christians, and sheds light on the development of early Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;''The Symbolic Jesus'' by William Edward Arnal 2005 {{ISBN|1845530071}} pp. 60–70&lt;/ref&gt;

There is overlap between the sayings of Jesus in the apocryphal texts and canonical Christian writings, and those not present in the canonical texts are called [[agrapha]]. There are at least 225 agrapha but most scholars who have studied them have drawn negative conclusions about the authenticity of most of them and see little value in using them for historical Jesus research.&lt;ref name=vvoorst183 /&gt; Robert Van Voorst states that the vast majority of the agrapha are certainly inauthentic.&lt;ref name=vvoorst183 /&gt; Scholars differ on the number of authentic agrapha, some estimating as low as seven as authentic, others as high as 18 among the more than 200, rendering them of little value altogether.&lt;ref name=vvoorst183 &gt;Van Voorst, Robert E (2000). ''Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence''. Eerdmans Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8028-4368-9}} p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; While research on apocryphal texts continues, the general scholarly opinion holds that they have little to offer to the study of the historicity of Jesus given that they are often of uncertain origin, and almost always later documents of lower value.&lt;ref name=vvoorst215 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2823">'''Species affinis''' (commonly abbreviated to: '''sp. aff.''',  '''aff.''', or '''affin.''') is [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] terminology in [[zoology]] and [[botany]]. In [[open nomenclature]] it indicates that available material or evidence suggests that the proposed [[species]] is ''related to'', has an ''[[Affinity (taxonomy)|affinity]]'' to, but is ''not identical to'', the species with the [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial]] name that follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url        = http://www.cactus-art.biz/note-book/Dictionary/Dictionary_S/dictionary_species_affinis.htm
 | title      = Species affinis (Affinis)
 | work       = Dictionary of botanic terminology
 | publisher  = cactus-art.biz
 | accessdate = 2010-12-13
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin word ''affinis'' can be translated as ''closely related to'', or ''akin to''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Oxford Latin Dictionary |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=79 |year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An author who inserts ''[[n.sp.]],'' or ''[[sp. nov.]], aff'' before a species name thereby states the opinion that the specimen is a new, previously [[Species description|undescribed]] species,&lt;ref name="Bengtson 1988"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bengtson|first=P.|title=Open Nomenclature|url=http://www.palass-pubs.org/palaeontology/pdf/Vol31/Pages%20223-227.pdf|work=Palentology|accessdate=2 April 2014|year=1988|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006071437/http://www.palass-pubs.org/palaeontology/pdf/Vol31/Pages%20223-227.pdf|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that there may not (yet) be enough information to complete a formal description. To use aff. alone, implies that the specimen differs suggestively from the [[holotype]] but that further progress is necessary to confirm that it is a novel species.

An example would be: a [[gastropod shell]] listed as [[Lucapina aff. aegis|''Lucapina'' aff. ''aegis'']] would mean that this shell somewhat resembles the shell of ''[[Lucapina aegis]]'', but is thought more likely to be another species, either closely related to, or closely resembling ''Lucapina aegis''. In a suitable context it also may suggest the possibility that the shell belongs to a species that has not yet been [[Species description|described]].

The use of aff. is similar to other indicators of open nomenclature such as [[cf.]], [[Species|sp.]], or ?,&lt;ref name="Bengtson 1988"/&gt; but the latter indicate that the species is ''uncertain'' rather than undescribed.

Tagging was popularized by [[website]]s associated with [[Web 2.0]] and is an important feature of many Web 2.0 services.&lt;ref name="Smith2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Breslin-et-al-2009"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Breslin |first1=John G. |last2=Passant |first2=Alexandre |last3=Decker |first3=Stefan |date=2009 |title=The social semantic web |location=Heidelberg; New York |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |isbn=9783642011719 |oclc=506401195 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-01172-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now also part of other [[database system]]s, [[desktop application]]s, and [[operating system]]s.&lt;ref name="JonesHafner2012"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Rodney H. |last2=Hafner |first2=Christoph A. |date=2012 |chapter=Networks and organization |title=Understanding digital literacies: a practical introduction |location=Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon; New York |publisher=[[Routledge]] |pages=23–28 |isbn=9780415673167 |oclc=711041611 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=-uySkGNM4RAC&amp;pg=PA23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
People use tags to aid [[Classification (machine learning)|classification]], mark ownership, note [[Boundary critique|boundaries]], and indicate [[online identity]]. Tags may take the form of words, images, or other identifying marks. An analogous example of tags in the physical world is [[museum]] object tagging. People were using textual [[Index term|keyword]]s to [[Document classification|classify information]] and objects long before computers. Computer based [[search algorithm]]s made the use of such keywords a rapid way of exploring records.

Tagging gained popularity due to the growth of [[social bookmarking]], [[image sharing]], and [[social networking]] websites.&lt;ref name="Smith2008"/&gt; These sites allow users to create and manage labels (or "tags") that categorize content using simple keywords. Websites that include tags often display collections of tags as [[tag cloud]]s,&lt;ref name="Blogs"&gt;For example, [[Blogger]] and [[WordPress]] can display tag clouds.&lt;/ref&gt; as do some desktop applications.&lt;ref name="DesktopTagCloud"&gt;For example: Leap is a [[macOS]] application that features a clickable tag cloud of macOS tags: {{cite web |last=Hampton-Smith |first=Sam |date=12 April 2013 |title=The pro designer's guide to photo organization |url=http://www.creativebloq.com/design-tools/organising-your-images-4132310 |website=creativebloq.com |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130416012408/http://www.creativebloq.com/design-tools/organising-your-images-4132310 |archivedate=16 April 2013 |quote=As with all the other options here, meta data can be added to individual files to help improve their find-ability, and uniquely the tag cloud field within Leap's interface allows you to quickly drill down to individually labelled files without fuss.}} TaggTool is a [[Windows]] application that permits tagging files and displaying a tag cloud: {{cite web |last=Henry |first=Alan |date=28 April 2010 |title=TaggTool: organize your files by keyword |url=http://appscout.pcmag.com/utilities/270236-taggtool-organize-your-files-by-keyword |website=pcmag.com |publisher=[[PC Magazine]] |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711002811/http://appscout.pcmag.com/utilities/270236-taggtool-organize-your-files-by-keyword |archivedate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On websites that aggregate the tags of all users, an individual user's tags can be useful both to them and to the larger community of the website's users.

Tagging systems have sometimes been classified into two kinds: ''top-down'' and ''bottom-up''.&lt;ref name="Breslin-et-al-2009"/&gt;{{rp|142}}&lt;ref name="JonesHafner2012"/&gt;{{rp|24}} Top-down [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] are created by an authorized group of designers (sometimes in the form of a [[controlled vocabulary]]), whereas bottom-up taxonomies (called [[Folksonomy|folksonomies]]) are created by all users.&lt;ref name="Breslin-et-al-2009"/&gt;{{rp|142}} This definition of "top down" and "bottom up" should not be confused with the distinction between a ''single hierarchical'' [[tree structure]] (in which there is one correct way to classify each item) versus ''multiple non-hierarchical'' [[Set (abstract data type)|set]]s (in which there are multiple ways to classify an item); the structure of both top-down and bottom-up taxonomies may be either hierarchical, non-hierarchical, or a combination of both.&lt;ref name="Breslin-et-al-2009"/&gt;{{rp|142–143}} Some researchers and applications have experimented with combining hierarchical and non-hierarchical tagging to aid in information retrieval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |last1=Heymann |first1=Paul |last2=Garcia-Molina |first2=Hector |date=2006 |title=Collaborative creation of communal hierarchical taxonomies in social tagging systems |institution=[[Stanford University]] |url=http://ilpubs.stanford.edu/775/}} Summarized in: {{cite web |last=Heymann |first=Paul |date=2006 |title=Tag hierarchies |url=http://infolab.stanford.edu/~heymann/taghierarchy.html |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625094513/http://infolab.stanford.edu/~heymann/taghierarchy.html |website=infolab.stanford.edu |archivedate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Quintarelli |first1=Emanuele |last2=Resmini |first2=Andrea |last3=Rosati |first3=Luca |date=June 2007 |title=Information architecture: Facetag: integrating bottom-up and top-down classification in a social tagging system |journal=[[Bulletin of the American Society for Information Science and Technology]] |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=10–15 |doi=10.1002/bult.2007.1720330506 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bult.2007.1720330506/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=Harris |last2=Zubair |first2=Mohammad |last3=Maly |first3=Kurt |date=2007 |chapter=Collaborative classification of growing collections with evolving facets |title=Proceedings of the eighteenth conference on hypertext and hypermedia, Manchester, UK, September 10–12, 2007 |series=HT '07 |location=New York |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] |pages=167–170 |isbn=9781595938206 |doi=10.1145/1286240.1286289 |chapterurl=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1286289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others are combining top-down and bottom-up tagging,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carcillo |first1=Franco |last2=Rosati |first2=Luca |date=2007 |chapter=Tags for citizens: integrating top-down and bottom-up classification in the Turin municipality website |editor-last=Schuler |editor-first=Douglas |title=Online communities and social computing: second international conference, OCSC 2007, held as part of HCI International 2007, Beijing, China, July 22–27, 2007: proceedings |volume=4564 |location=Berlin; New York |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |pages=256–264 |isbn=9783540732563 |oclc=184906067 |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-73257-0_29}}&lt;/ref&gt; including in some large library catalogs ([[Online public access catalog|OPAC]]s) such as [[WorldCat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wilson |first=Katie |date=2007 |title=OPAC 2.0: next generation online library catalogues ride the Web 2.0 wave! |journal=Online Currents |volume=21 |issue=10 |pages=406–413 |url=https://works.bepress.com/katie_wilson/14/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yee"&gt;{{cite book |last=Yee |first=Raymond |date=2008 |chapter=Understanding tagging and folksonomies |title=Pro Web 2.0 mashups: remixing data and Web services |series=The expert's voice in Web development |location=Berkeley |publisher=[[Apress]] |pages=61–75 |isbn=9781590598580 |oclc=148910044 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4302-0286-8_3 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=eGdLbRZ5AX0C&amp;pg=PA61}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|74}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Willey |first=Eric |date=2011 |title=A cautious partnership: the growing acceptance of folksonomy as a complement to indexing digital images and catalogs |url=http://ir.library.illinoisstate.edu/fpml/57/ |publisher=Library Student Journal |website=illinoisstate.edu |accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gerolimos |first=Michalis |date=January 2013 |title=Tagging for libraries: a review of the effectiveness of tagging systems for library catalogs |journal=Journal of Library Metadata |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=36–58 |doi=10.1080/19386389.2013.778730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When tags or other taxonomies have further properties (or [[Semantics (computer science)|semantics]]) such as [[Relation (philosophy)|relationship]]s and [[Attribute (computing)|attribute]]s, they constitute an [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]].&lt;ref name="Breslin-et-al-2009"/&gt;{{rp|56–62}}

Metadata tags as described in this article should not be confused with the use of the word "tag" in some software to refer to an automatically generated [[cross-reference]]; examples of the latter are ''tags tables'' in [[Emacs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Raman |first=T.

==History==
The use of keywords as part of an identification and classification system long predates computers. [[Paper data storage]] devices, notably [[edge-notched card]]s, that permitted classification and sorting by multiple criteria were already in use prior to the twentieth century, and [[faceted classification]] has been used by libraries since the 1930s.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the [[Unix]] [[text editor]] [[Emacs]] offered a companion software program called ''Tags'' that could automatically build a table of cross-references called a ''tags table'' that Emacs could use to jump between a [[function call]] and that function's definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Meyrowitz |first1=Norman |last2=Dam |first2=Andries |date=September 1982 |title=Interactive Editing Systems: Part II |journal=[[ACM Computing Surveys]] (CSUR) |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=353–415 (366–367) |doi=10.1145/356887.356890 |url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/356887.356890 |quote=EMACS is an M.I.T. display editor designed to be 'extensible, customizable, and self-documenting' [...] Another interesting facility for program editing is the TAGS package. The separate program TAGS builds a TAGS table containing the file name and position in that file in which each application program function is defined. This table is loaded into EMACS; specifying the command Meta, ''function name'' causes EMACS to select the appropriate file and go to the proper function definition within that file.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This use of the word "tag" did not refer to metadata tags, but was an early use of the word "tag" in software to refer to a [[Index (publishing)|word index]].

[[Online database]]s and early websites deployed keyword tags as a way for publishers to help users find content. In the early days of the [[World Wide Web]], the &lt;code&gt;keywords&lt;/code&gt; [[meta element]] was used by [[web designer]]s to tell [[web search engine]]s what the web page was about, but these keywords were only visible in a web page's [[source code]] and were not modifiable by users.

[[File:A Description of the Equator and Some Otherlands, collaborative hypercinema portal Upload page.jpg|thumb|"A Description of the Equator and Some ØtherLands", collaborative hypercinema portal, produced by documenta X, 1997. User upload page associating user contributed media with the term ''Tag''.]] In 1997, the collaborative portal "A Description of the Equator and Some ØtherLands" produced by [[documenta]] X, Germany, used the [[Folksonomy|folksonomic]] term ''Tag'' for its co-authors and guest authors on its Upload page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Description of the Equator and Some ØtherLands |url=http://aporee.org/equator/ |website=aporee.org |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010818013629/http://aporee.org/equator/ |archivedate=18 August 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "The Equator" the term ''Tag'' for user-input was described as an ''abstract literal or keyword'' to aid the user. However, users defined singular ''Tags'', and did not share ''Tags'' at that point.

In 2003, the [[social bookmarking]] website [[Delicious (website)|Delicious]] provided a way for its users to add "tags" to their bookmarks (as a way to help find them later);&lt;ref name="Smith2008"/&gt;{{rp|162}} Delicious also provided browseable aggregated views of the bookmarks of all users featuring a particular tag.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: [https://www.flickr.com/photos/joshu/765809051/in/set-72157600740166824/ Screenshot of tags on del.icio.us] in 2004 and [https://www.flickr.com/photos/joshu/765817375/in/set-72157600740166824/ Screenshot of a tag page on del.icio.us], also in 2004, both published by [[Joshua Schachter]] on July 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Within a couple of years, the [[photo sharing]] website [[Flickr]] allowed its users to add their own text tags to each of their pictures, constructing flexible and easy metadata that made the pictures highly searchable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Garrett |first=Jesse James |date=4 August 2005 |title=An Interview with Flickr's Eric Costello |url=http://adaptivepath.org/ideas/e000519/ |quote=Tags were not in the initial version of Flickr. Stewart Butterfield wanted to add them. He liked the way they worked on del.icio.us, the social bookmarking application. We added very simple tagging functionality, so you could tag your photos, and then look at all your photos with a particular tag, or any one person's photos with a particular tag. Soon thereafter, users started telling us that what was really interesting about tagging was not just how you've tagged your photos, but how the whole Flickr community has been tagging photos. So we started seeing a lot of requests from users to be able to see a global view of the tagscape.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of Flickr and the influence of Delicious popularized the concept,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mathes |first=Adam |date=December 2004 |title=Folksonomies: cooperative classification and communication through shared metadata |url=http://www.adammathes.com/academic/computer-mediated-communication/folksonomies.html |website=adammathes.com |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170309071911/http://www.adammathes.com/academic/computer-mediated-communication/folksonomies.html |archivedate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other [[social software]] websites—such as [[YouTube]], [[Technorati]], and [[Last.fm]]—also implemented tagging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gupta |first1=Manish |last2=Li |first2=Rui |last3=Yin |first3=Zhijun |last4=Han |first4=Jiawei |date=2011 |chapter=An overview of social tagging and applications |editor-last=Aggarwal |editor-first=Charu C. |title=Social network data analytics |location=New York |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |pages=447–497 |isbn=9781441984616 |oclc=709712928 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-8462-3_16 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=SE2iRgeYYwcC&amp;pg=PA446}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the [[Atom (standard)|Atom]] [[web syndication]] standard provided a "category" element for inserting subject categories into [[web feed]]s, and in 2007 [[Tim Bray]] proposed a "tag" [[Uniform Resource Name|URN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bray |first=Tim |authorlink=Tim Bray |date=1 February 2007 |title=A Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace for tag metadata |url=https://www.tbray.org/tmp/tag-urn.html |website=tbray.org |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105032324/http://www.tbray.org/tmp/tag-urn.html |archivedate=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Within a blog===
Many [[blog]] systems (and other web [[content management system]]s) allow authors to add free-form tags to a post, along with (or instead of) placing the post into a predetermined category.&lt;ref name="Blogs"/&gt; For example, a post may display that it has been tagged with &lt;code&gt;baseball&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tickets&lt;/code&gt;. Each of those tags is usually a [[web link]] leading to an index page listing all of the posts associated with that tag. The blog may have a sidebar listing all the tags in use on that blog, with each tag leading to an index page. To reclassify a post, an author edits its list of tags. All connections between posts are automatically tracked and updated by the blog software; there is no need to relocate the page within a complex hierarchy of categories.

===Within application software===
{{See also|Tag editor|Comparison of metadata editors}}
Some [[desktop application]]s and [[web application]]s feature their own tagging systems, such as email tagging in [[Gmail]] and [[Mozilla Thunderbird]],&lt;ref name="Yee"/&gt;{{rp|73}} bookmark tagging in [[Firefox]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Firefox tip: find bookmarks faster with tags |url=https://blog.mozilla.org/theden/2013/08/26/firefox-tip-find-bookmarks-faster-with-tags/ |website=blog.mozilla.org |publisher=[[Mozilla Foundation]] |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012154755/https://blog.mozilla.org/theden/2013/08/26/firefox-tip-find-bookmarks-faster-with-tags/ |archivedate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; audio tagging in [[iTunes]] or [[Winamp]], and photo tagging in various applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hinton |first1=Mark Justice |last2=Obermeier |first2=Barbara |last3=Sahlin |first3=Doug |date=2010 |chapter=Tagging photos |title=Editing digital photos for dummies |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |isbn=9780470591451 |oclc=606841528}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these applications display collections of tags as [[tag cloud]]s.&lt;ref name="DesktopTagCloud"/&gt;

===Assigned to computer files===
There are various systems for applying tags to the files in a computer's [[file system]]. In [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[macOS]], the operating system has allowed users to assign multiple arbitrary tags as [[extended file attributes]] to any file or folder ever since [[OS X 10.9]] was released in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Siracusa |first=John |date=22 October 2013 |title=OS X 10.9 Mavericks: The Ars Technica Review: Tags |url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/10/os-x-10-9/8/ |website=arstechnica.com |publisher=[[Ars Technica]] |accessdate=10 March 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109052357/http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/10/os-x-10-9/8/ |archivedate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and before that time the [[open-source]] OpenMeta standard provided similar tagging functionality in macOS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cherp |first=Aleh |date=17 March 2011 |title=Tagging |url=https://macademic.org/2011/03/17/tagging/ |website=macademic.org |publisher=Academic workflows on a Mac |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430074346/http://macademic.org/2011/03/17/tagging/ |archivedate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[semantic file system]]s that implement tags are available for the [[Linux kernel]], including [[Tagsistant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Extended attributes and tag file systems |date=2 July 2015 |url=https://www.lesbonscomptes.com/pages/tagfs.html |website=lesbonscomptes.com |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811104645/http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/pages/tagfs.html |archivedate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft Windows]] allows users to set tags only on [[Microsoft Office]] documents and some kinds of picture files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schultz |first=Greg |date=23 March 2011 |title=Tag your files for easier searches in Windows 7 |url=http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/windows-and-office/tag-your-files-for-easier-searches-in-windows-7/ |website=techrepublic.com |publisher=[[TechRepublic]] |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829073706/http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/windows-and-office/tag-your-files-for-easier-searches-in-windows-7/ |archivedate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cross-platform]] file tagging standards include [[Extensible Metadata Platform]] (XMP), an [[List of International Organization for Standardization standards|ISO standard]] for embedding metadata into popular image, video and document file formats, such as [[JPEG]] and [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], without breaking their readability by applications that do not support XMP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gasiorowski-Denis |first=Elizabeth |date=22 March 2012 |title=Adobe Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) becomes an ISO standard |url=https://www.iso.org/news/2012/03/Ref1525.html |website=iso.org |publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization]] |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170310223841/https://www.iso.org/news/2012/03/Ref1525.html |archivedate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; XMP largely supersedes the earlier [[IPTC Information Interchange Model]]. [[Exif]] is a standard that specifies the image and audio [[file format]]s used by [[digital camera]]s, including some metadata tags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Płoszajski |first=Grzegorz |date=2017 |chapter=Metadata in long-term digital preservation |editor1-last=Traczyk |editor1-first=Tomasz |editor2-last=Ogryczak |editor2-first=Włodzimierz |editor3-last=Pałka |editor3-first=Piotr |editor4-last=Śliwiński |editor4-first=Tomasz |title=Digital preservation: putting it to work |series=Studies in computational intelligence |location=New York |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |pages=15–61 |isbn=9783319518008 |oclc=969844731 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-51801-5_2 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJrlDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[TagSpaces]] is an open-source cross-platform application for tagging files; it inserts tags into the [[filename]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Devcic |first=Ivana Isadora |date=9 October 2015 |title=Tag, you're it!

===For an event===
An ''official tag'' is a keyword adopted by events and conferences for participants to use in their web publications, such as blog entries, photos of the event, and presentation slides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Finch |first=Curt |date=26 May 2011 |title=Hashtag techniques for businesses |url=http://www.inc.com/tech-blog/twitter-hashtag-techniques-for-businesses.html |website=inc.com |publisher=[[Inc. (magazine)|Inc. Magazine]] |accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Search engines can then index them to make relevant materials related to the event searchable in a uniform way. In this case, the tag is part of a [[controlled vocabulary]].

===In research===
A researcher may work with a large collection of items (e.g. press quotes, a bibliography, images) in digital form. If he/she wishes to associate each with a small number of themes (e.g. to chapters of a book, or to sub-themes of the overall subject), then a group of tags for these themes can be attached to each of the items in the larger collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Parry |first=David |date=11 March 2007 |title=Tagging files—or how to keep research organized |url=http://academhack.outsidethetext.com/home/2007/tagging-filesor-how-to-keep-research-organized/ |website=academhack.outsidethetext.com |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160802081239/http://academhack.outsidethetext.com/home/2007/tagging-filesor-how-to-keep-research-organized/ |archivedate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, freeform [[Categorization|classification]] allows the author to manage what would otherwise be unwieldy amounts of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Richard |date=December 2010 |title=Strategies for coping with information overload |journal=[[The BMJ]] |volume=341 |pages=c7126 |doi=10.1136/bmj.c7126 |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c7126 |pmid=21159764}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special types==

===Triple tags===
{{see also|Microformat}}
A '''triple tag''' or '''machine tag''' uses a special [[syntax]] to define extra [[semantic]] information about the tag, making it easier or more meaningful for interpretation by a computer program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bainbridge |first1=Scott |last2=Page |first2=Geoff |last3=Jaroensutasinee |first3=Mullica |last4=Jaroensutasinee |first4=Krisanadej |date=September 2011 |chapter=Towards a services based architecture for real time marine observing data |title=OCEANS '11 MTS/IEEE Kona, Waikoloa, Hawaii, USA, 19–22 22 September 2011 |location=Piscataway, NJ |publisher=[[IEEE]] |pages=740–745 |isbn=9781457714276 |oclc=777270556 |chapterurl=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6106990/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Triple tags comprise three parts: a [[namespace]], a [[wikt:predicate|predicate]], and a value. For example, &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;geo:long=50.123456&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a tag for the geographical [[longitude]] coordinate whose value is 50.123456. This triple structure is similar to the [[Resource Description Framework]] model for information.

The triple tag format was first devised for geolicious in November 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Maron |first=Mikel |date=5 November 2004 |title=geo.lici.us: geotagging hosted services |url=http://brainoff.com/weblog/2004/11/05/124 |website=brainoff.com |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428042415/http://brainoff.com/weblog/2004/11/05/124 |archivedate=28 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; to map [[Delicious (website)|Delicious]] bookmarks, and gained wider acceptance after its adoption by Mappr and GeoBloggers to map [[Flickr]] photos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Catt |first=Dan |date=11 January 2006 |title=Advanced Tagging and TripleTags |url=http://geobloggers.com/archives/2006/01/11/advanced-tagging-and-tripletags/ |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011024028/http://geobloggers.com/archives/2006/01/11/advanced-tagging-and-tripletags/ |archivedate=18 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007, Aaron Straup Cope at Flickr introduced the term ''machine tag'' as an alternative name for the triple tag, adding some questions and answers on purpose, syntax, and use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Straup Cope |first=Aaron |date=24 January 2007 |title=Machine tags |url=https://www.flickr.com/groups/api/discuss/72157594497877875/ |website=flickr.com |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420154054/https://www.flickr.com/groups/api/discuss/72157594497877875/ |archivedate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specialized metadata for geographical identification is known as ''[[geotagging]]''; machine tags are also used for other purposes, such as identifying photos taken at a specific event or naming species using [[binomial nomenclature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Encyclopedia of Life Flickr group rules |url=https://www.flickr.com/groups/encyclopedia_of_life/rules/ |website=flickr.com |publisher=[[Encyclopedia of Life]] |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170210051254/https://www.flickr.com/groups/encyclopedia_of_life/rules/ |archivedate=10 February 2017}} Includes the required use of a taxonomy machine tag.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hashtags===
{{main|Hashtag}}
A hashtag is a kind of metadata tag marked by the prefix &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;, sometimes known as a "hash" symbol. This form of tagging is used on [[microblogging]] and [[social networking service]]s such as [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], [[Google+]], [[VK (social network)|VK]] and [[Instagram]].

===Knowledge tags===
{{See also|Knowledge base|Knowledge representation|Personal knowledge base}}
A '''knowledge tag''' is a type of [[metadata|meta-information]] that describes or defines some aspect of a piece of information (such as a [[document]], [[digital image]], [[database table]], or [[web page]]).&lt;ref name="Panda-et-al-2012"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Panda |first1=Mrutyunjaya |last2=El-Bendary |first2=Nashwa |last3=Salama |first3=Mostafa A. |last4=Hassanien |first4=Aboul Ella |last5=Abraham |first5=Ajith |date=2012 |chapter=Computational social networks: tools, perspectives, and challenges |editor1-last=Abraham |editor1-first=Ajith |editor2-last=Hassanien |editor2-first=Aboul-Ella |title=Computational social networks: tools, perspectives, and applications |location=New York |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |pages=3–23 [14–15] |isbn=9781447140474 |oclc=798568503 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4471-4048-1_1 |chapterurl=http://www.softcomputing.net/csn12_chap1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge tags are more than traditional non-hierarchical [[Index term|keywords or terms]]; they are a type of [[metadata]] that captures knowledge in the form of descriptions, categorizations, classifications, [[semantics]], comments, notes, annotations, [[hyperdata]], [[hyperlinks]], or references that are collected in tag profiles (a kind of [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]]).&lt;ref name="Panda-et-al-2012"/&gt; These tag profiles reference an information resource that resides in a distributed, and often heterogeneous, storage repository.&lt;ref name="Panda-et-al-2012"/&gt;

Knowledge tags are part of a [[knowledge management]] discipline that leverages [[Enterprise 2.0]] methodologies for users to capture insights, expertise, attributes, dependencies, or relationships associated with a data resource.&lt;ref name="Breslin-et-al-2009"/&gt;{{rp|251}}&lt;ref name="Wiig"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wiig |first=Karl M. |date=March 1997 |title=Knowledge management: an introduction and perspective |journal=[[Journal of Knowledge Management]] |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=6–14 |doi=10.1108/13673279710800682}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different kinds of knowledge can be captured in knowledge tags, including factual knowledge (that found in books and data), conceptual knowledge (found in perspectives and concepts), expectational knowledge (needed to make judgments and hypothesis), and methodological knowledge (derived from reasoning and strategies).&lt;ref name="Wiig"/&gt; These forms of [[knowledge]] often exist outside the data itself and are derived from personal experience, insight, or expertise. Knowledge tags are considered an expansion of the information itself that adds additional value, context, and meaning to the information. Knowledge tags are valuable for preserving organizational intelligence that is often lost due to [[Turnover (employment)|turnover]], for sharing knowledge stored in the minds of individuals that is typically isolated and unharnessed by the organization, and for connecting knowledge that is often lost or disconnected from an information resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alavi |first1=Maryam |last2=Leidner |first2=Dorothy E. |date=February 1999 |title=Knowledge management systems: issues, challenges, and benefits |journal=Communications of the AIS |volume=1 |issue=2es |pages=1 |url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=374116.374117 |publisher=[[Association for Information Systems]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages==
In a typical tagging system, there is no explicit information about the meaning or [[semantics]] of each tag, and a user can apply new tags to an item as easily as applying older tags.&lt;ref name="Smith2008"/&gt; Hierarchical classification systems can be slow to change, and are rooted in the culture and era that created them; in contrast, the flexibility of tagging allows users to classify their collections of items in the ways that they find useful, but the personalized variety of terms can present challenges when searching and browsing.

When users can freely choose tags (creating a [[folksonomy]], as opposed to selecting terms from a [[controlled vocabulary]]), the resulting metadata can include [[homonym]]s (the same tags used with different meanings) and [[synonym]]s (multiple tags for the same concept), which may lead to inappropriate connections between items and inefficient searches for information about a subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Golder |first1=Scott A. |last2=Huberman |first2=Bernardo A. |date=April 2006 |title=Usage patterns of collaborative tagging systems |journal=[[Journal of Information Science]] |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=198–208 |doi=10.1177/0165551506062337}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the tag "orange" may refer to the [[Orange (fruit)|fruit]] or the [[Orange (colour)|color]], and items related to a version of the [[Linux kernel]] may be tagged "Linux", "kernel", "Penguin", "software", or a variety of other terms. Users can also choose tags that are different [[inflection]]s of words (such as singular and plural),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Devens |first=Keith |date=24 December 2004 |title=Singular vs. plural tags in a tag-based categorization system (such as del.icio.us) |url=http://keithdevens.com/weblog/archive/2004/Dec/24/SvP.tags |website=keithdevens.com |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510221217/http://keithdevens.com/weblog/archive/2004/Dec/24/SvP.tags |archivedate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can contribute to navigation difficulties if the system does not include [[stemming]] of tags when searching or browsing. Larger-scale folksonomies address some of the problems of tagging, in that users of tagging systems tend to notice the current use of "tag terms" within these systems, and thus use existing tags in order to easily form connections to related items. In this way, folksonomies may collectively develop a partial set of tagging conventions.

===Complex system dynamics===
Despite the apparent lack of control, research has shown that a simple form of shared vocabulary emerges in social bookmarking systems. Collaborative tagging exhibits a form of [[complex system]]s dynamics (or [[Self-organization|self-organizing]] dynamics).&lt;ref name="WWW07-ref"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Halpin |first1=Harry |last2=Robu |first2=Valentin |last3=Shepherd |first3=Hana |date=2007 |chapter=The complex dynamics of collaborative tagging |title=Proceedings of the 16th international conference on World Wide Web, Banff, Alberta, Canada, May 08–12, 2007 |series=WWW '07 |location=New York |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] |pages=211–220 |isbn=9781595936547 |oclc=173331796 |doi=10.1145/1242572.1242602 |chapterurl=http://www2007.org/papers/paper635.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, even if no central controlled vocabulary constrains the actions of individual users, the distribution of tags converges over time to stable [[power law]] distributions.&lt;ref name="WWW07-ref"/&gt; Once such stable distributions form, simple [[Folksonomy|folksonomic]] vocabularies can be extracted by examining the [[correlation]]s that form between different tags. In addition, research has suggested that it is easier for [[machine learning]] algorithms to learn tag semantics when users tag "verbosely"—when they annotate resources with a wealth of freely associated, descriptive keywords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Körner |first1=Christian |last2=Benz |first2=Dominik |last3=Hotho |first3=Andreas |last4=Strohmaier |first4=Markus |last5=Stumme |first5=Gerd |date=2010 |chapter=Stop thinking, start tagging: tag semantics emerge from collaborative verbosity |title=Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on World Wide Web, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA, April 26–30, 2010 |series=WWW '10 |location=New York |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] |pages=521–530 |isbn=9781605587998 |oclc=671101543 |doi=10.1145/1772690.1772744 |chapterurl=http://wwwconference.org/proceedings/www2010/www/p521.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spamming===
Tagging systems open to the public are also open to tag spam, in which people apply an excessive number of tags or unrelated tags to an item (such as a [[YouTube]] video) in order to attract viewers. This abuse can be mitigated using human or statistical identification of spam items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Heymann |first=Paul |title=Tag spam |url=http://heymann.stanford.edu/tagspam.html |website=stanford.edu |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of tags allowed may also be limited to reduce spam.

==Syntax==
Some tagging systems provide a single [[text box]] to enter tags, so to be able to [[tokenize]] the string, a [[Wiktionary:separator|separator]] must be used. Two popular separators are the [[Space (punctuation)|space character]] and the [[comma]]. To enable the use of separators in the tags, a system may allow for higher-level separators (such as [[quotation mark]]s) or [[escape character]]s. Systems can avoid the use of separators by allowing only one tag to be added to each input [[Web widget|widget]] at a time, although this makes adding multiple tags more time-consuming.

A syntax for use within [[HTML]] is to use the '''rel-tag''' [[microformat]] which uses the [[Rel attribute|''rel'' attribute]] with value "tag" (i.e., &lt;code&gt;rel="tag"&lt;/code&gt;) to indicate that the linked-to page acts as a tag for the current context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Microformats wiki: rel='tag' |url=http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-tag |website=microformats.org |date=10 January 2005 |accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Text Annotation''' is the practice and the result of adding a note or [[gloss (annotation)|gloss]] to a text, which may include highlights or underlining, comments, footnotes, tags, and links. Text annotations can include notes written for a reader's private purposes, as well as shared annotations written for the purposes of collaborative writing and [[Collaborative editing|editing]], commentary, or social reading and sharing. In some fields, text annotation is comparable to metadata insofar as it is added post hoc and provides information about a text without fundamentally altering that original text.&lt;ref name= "Shabjee and Reynolds"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shabajee|first=P. and D. Reynolds|title=What is Annotation? A Short Review of Annotation and Annotation Systems|url=http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/publications/researchreport/rr1053/report_html?ilrtyear=2003|work=ILRT Research Report No. 1053|publisher=Institute for Learning &amp; Research Technology|accessdate=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Text annotations are sometimes referred to as [[marginalia]], though some reserve this term specifically for hand-written notes made in the margins of books or manuscripts. Annotations are extremely useful and help to develop knowledge of English literature.

This article covers both private and socially shared text annotations, including hand-written and information technology-based annotation. For information on annotation of Web content, including images and other non-textual content, see also [[Web annotation]].

== History ==

Text annotation may be as old as writing on media, where it was possible to produce an additional copy with a reasonable effort. It became a prominent activity around 1000 AD in [[Talmud#Commentaries|Talmudic commentaries]] and Arabic rhetorics treaties. In the Medieval era, scribes who copied manuscripts often made marginal annotations that then circulated with the manuscripts and were thus shared with the community; sometimes annotations were copied over to new versions when such manuscripts were later recopied.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolfe,|first=Joanna|author2=Christine M. Neuwirth |title=From the Margins to the Center: The Future of Annotation|journal=Journal of Business and Technical Communication|year=2001|volume=15|issue=33|pages=333–370|doi=10.1177/105065190101500304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise of the [[printing press]] and the relative ease of circulating and purchasing individual (rather than shared) copies of texts, the prevalence of socially shared annotations declined and text annotation became a more private activity consisting of a reader interacting with a text.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt; Annotations made on shared copies of texts (such as library books) are sometimes seen as devaluing the text, or as an act of defacement. Thus, print technologies support the circulation of annotations primarily as formal scholarly commentary or [[Footnotes|textual footnotes or endnotes]] rather than marginal, handwritten comments made by private readers, though handwritten comments or annotations were common in collaborative writing or editing.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt;

Computer-based technologies have provided new opportunities for individual and socially shared text annotations that support multiple purposes, including readers’ individual reading goals, [[learning]], social [[Reading (process)|reading]], [[writing]] and [[editing]], and other practices.  Text annotation in Information Technology (IT) systems raises technical issues of access, linkage, and [[Computer data storage|storage]] that are generally not relevant to paper-based text annotation, and thus research and development of such systems often addresses these areas.&lt;ref name="Shabjee and Reynolds"/&gt;

== Functions and Applications ==

Text annotations can serve a variety of functions for both private and public reading and communication practices. In their article "From the Margins to the Center: The Future of Annotation," scholars Joanna Wolfe and Christine Neuwirth identify four primary functions that text annotations commonly serve in the modern era, including: (1)"facilitat[ing] reading and later writing tasks," which includes annotations that support reading for both personal and professional purposes; (2)"eavesdrop[ping] on the insights of other readers," which involves sharing of annotations; (3)"provid[ing] feedback to writers or promote communication with collaborators," which can include personal, professional, and education-related feedback; and (4)"call[ing] attention to topics and important passages," for which scholarly annotations, footnotes, and call-outs often function.&lt;ref name = "Wolfe and Neuwirth"/&gt; Regarding the ways that annotations can support individual reading tasks, Catherine Marshall points out that the ways that readers annotate texts depends on the purpose, [[motivation]], and context of reading. Readers may annotate to help interpret a text, to call attention to a section for future reference or reading, to support [[memory]] and recall, to help focus attention on the text as they read, to work out a problem related to the text, or create annotations not specifically related to the text at all.&lt;ref name=MarshallReadWriteElectronicBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Catherine|title=Reading and Writing the Electronic Book|journal=Synthesis Lectures on Information Concepts, Retrieval, and Services|volume=1|year=2010|publisher=Morgan &amp; Claypool|location=UNC Chapel Hill|pages=38–51|url=http://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/pdf/10.2200/S00215ED1V01Y200907ICR009|doi=10.2200/S00215ED1V01Y200907ICR009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Educational applications ===

Educational research in text annotation has examined the role that both private and shared text annotations can play in supporting learning goals and [[communication]]. Much educational research examines how students’ private annotation of texts supports [[Reading comprehension|comprehension]] and memory; for example, research indicates that annotating texts causes more in-depth processing of information, which results in greater recall of information.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt;

Other areas of educational research investigate the benefits of socially shared text annotations for [[collaborative learning]], both for paper-based and IT-based annotation sharing. For example, studies by Joanna Wolfe have investigated the benefits of exposure to others’ annotations on student readers and writers. In a 2000 study, Wolfe found that exposing students to others’ annotations influenced their perceptions of the annotators, which in turn shaped their responses to the material and their written products.&lt;ref name="Wolfe, Effects"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=Joanna|title=Effects of Annotations on Student Readers and Writers|journal=Proceedings of the fifth ACM conference on Digital libraries|year=2000|pages=19–26|doi=10.1145/336597.336620|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=336620|isbn=158113231X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later study, Wolfe found that viewing others’ written comments on a paper text, especially pairs of annotations that present opposing responses to the text, can help students engage in the type of [[critical reading]] and stance-taking necessary for effective [[Argumentation|argumentative writing]].&lt;ref name="Wofe AnnoandCollabDigitalLib" /&gt;

While shared annotations can benefit individual readers, it is important to note that, "since the 1920s, [[literacy]] theory has increasingly emphasized the importance of social factors in the development of literacy."&lt;ref name=KaplanChisikInTheCompanyOfReaders /&gt;  Thus, shared annotations can not only help one to better understand the content of a particular text, but may also aid in the acquirement of literacy skills. For example, a mother may leave marks inside a book to draw the attention of her child to a particular theme or concept; thanks to the development of audio annotations, parents may now leave notes for children who are just starting to read and may struggle with textual annotations.&lt;ref name=KaplanChisikInTheCompanyOfReaders&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Nancy|author2=Yoram Chisik |title=In the Company of Readers: The Digital Library Book as "Practiced Place"|journal=Proceedings of the 5th ACM/IEEE-CS joint conference on Digital libraries|year=2005|pages=235–243|doi=10.1145/1065385.1065439|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1065439|isbn=1581138768}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent research in the effects of shared text annotations has focused on the learning applications for web-based annotation systems, some of which were developed based on design recommendations from studies outlined above. For example, Ananda Gunawardena, Aaron Tan, and David Kaufer conducted a pilot study to examine whether annotating documents in Classroom Salon, a web-based annotation and social reading platform, encouraged active reading, error detection, and collaboration in a computer science course at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. This study suggested a correlation between students’ overall performance in the course and their ability to identify errors in a text that they annotated in Classroom Salon; it also found that students were likely to change their annotations in response to annotations made by others in the course.&lt;ref name=GunaTanKauferEncouragingReadingandCollaboration&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gunawardena|first=Ananda|author2=Aaron Tan |author3=David Kaufer |title=Encouraging Reading and Collaboration Using Classroom Salon|journal=Proceedings of the Fifteenth Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education|year=2010|pages=254–258|doi=10.1145/1822090.1822162|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1822162&amp;dl=ACM&amp;coll=DL&amp;CFID=90744943&amp;CFTOKEN=38262707|isbn=9781605587295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the web-based annotation tool HyLighter was used in a first-year writing course and shown to improve the development of students’ mental models of texts, including supporting reading comprehension, [[critical thinking]], and the ability to develop a thesis. The collaboration with peers and experts around a shared text improved these skills and brought the communities’ understanding closer together.&lt;ref name="Mendenhall et all Implementation of an Online Social Annotation Tool"&gt;{{cite book|title=Multiple Perspectives on Problem Solving and Learning in the Digital Age.|publisher=Springer|location=New York|pages=313–323|author=Mendenhall, A. |author2=C.

Sampson|chapter=Implementation of an Online Social Annotation Tool in a College English Course.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A meta-analysis of empirical studies into the higher-education uses of social annotation (SA) tools indicates such tools have been tested in several courses, among them [[English studies|English]], [[sport psychology]], and [[hypermedia]]. Studies have indicated that social annotation functions, including commenting, information sharing, and highlighting, can support instruction designed to foster collaborative learning and communication, as well as reading comprehension, [[metacognition]], and critical analysis. Several studies indicated that students enjoyed using social annotation tools, and that it improved motivation in the course.&lt;ref name="Novak et al Educaitonal Uses of Social Annotation Tools"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Novak|first=Elena |author2=Rim Razzouk |author3=Tristan E. Johnson|title=The Educational Uses of Social Annotation Tools in Higher Education: A Literature Review|journal=Internet and Higher Education|year=2012|volume=15|pages=39–49|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ947876&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ947876|doi=10.1016/j.iheduc.2011.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Writing and text-centered collaboration ===

Text annotations have long been used in writing and revision processes as a way for reviewers to suggest changes and communicate about a text.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt; In book publishing, for example, the collaboration of authors and editors to develop and revise a manuscript frequently involves exchanges of both in-line revisions or notes as well as marginal annotations. Similarly, copyeditors often make marginal annotations or notes that explain or suggest revisions or are directed at the author as questions or suggestions (commonly called "queries").&lt;ref name=Einsohn&gt;{{cite book|last=Einsohn|first=Emily|title=The Copyeditor's Handbook|year=2000|publisher=University of California Press|location=London, England|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_copyeditor_s_handbook.html?id=qv1p2RYbpY0C|isbn=9780520218352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asynchronous collaborative writing and document development often depend on text annotations as a way not only to suggest revisions but also to exchange ideas during document development or to facilitate group decision making, though such processes are often complicated by the use of different communication technologies (such as phone calls or emails as well as document sharing) for distinct tasks.&lt;ref name="Weng and Gennari"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weng|first=Chuhnua|author2=John H. Gennari |title=Asynchronous Collaborative Writing Through Annotations|journal=Proceedings of the 2004 ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work '04|year=2004|volume=6|issue=3|pages=578–581|doi=10.1145/1031607.1031705|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1031607.1031705}}&lt;/ref&gt; Text annotations can also function to allow group or community members to communicate about a shared text, such as a doctor annotating a patient's chart.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt;

Much research into the functionality and design of collaborative IT-based writing systems, which often support text annotation, has occurred in the area of [[computer-supported cooperative work]].&lt;ref name="Rodriguez and Eklundh"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rodriguez|first=Henry|author2=Kerstin Severinson Eklundh |title=Visualizing Patterns of Annotation in Document-Centered Collaboration on the Web|journal=Studies in Writing: Vol. 17 Writing and Digital Media|year=2005|pages=131–143|editor1-first=L. |editor1-last=Van Waes |editor2-first=M. |editor2-last=Leijten |editor3-first=C. |editor3-last=Neuwirth |others=G.

== Structure and Design ==

Research in the design and development of annotation systems uses specific terminology to refer to distinct structural components of annotations and also distinguishes among options for digital annotation displays.

===Annotation structure===
The structural components of any annotation can be roughly divided into three primary elements: a ''body'', an ''anchor'', and a ''marker''. The body of an annotation includes reader-generated [[symbols]] and text, such as handwritten commentary or stars in the margin. The anchor is what indicates the extent of the original text to which the body of the annotation refers; it may include circles around sections, brackets, highlights, underlines, and so on. Annotations may be anchored to very broad stretches of text (such as an entire document) or very narrow sections (such as a specific letter, word, or phrase). The marker is the visual appearance of the anchor, such as whether it is a grey underline or a yellow highlight. An annotation that has a body (such as a comment in the margin) but no specific anchor has no marker.&lt;ref name=MarshallReadWriteElectronicBook /&gt;

===Annotation display types===
IT-based annotation systems utilize a variety of display options for annotations, including:
* Footnote interfaces that display annotations below the corresponding text
* Aligned annotations that display comments and notes vertically in the text margins, sometimes in multiple columns or as a "sidebar" layer
* Interlinear annotations that attach annotations directly into a text
* Sticky note interfaces, where annotations appear in popup dialogs over the source text
* Voice annotations, in which reviewers record annotations and embed them within a document
* Pen or digital-ink based interfaces that allow writing directly on a document or screen
Annotation interfaces may also allow highlighting or underlining, as well as threaded discussions.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolfe Annotation Technologies"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=Joanna|title=Annotation Technologies: A software and Research Review|journal=Computers and Composition|year=2002|volume=19|issue=4|pages=471–497|doi=10.1016/s8755-4615(02)00144-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharing and communicating through annotations anchored to specific documents is sometimes referred to as ''anchored discussion''.&lt;ref name="Wofe AnnoandCollabDigitalLib"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=Joanna|title=Annotations and the Collaborative Digital Library: Effects of an Aligned Annotion Interface on Student Argumentation and Reading Strategies|journal=Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning|date=Jun 2008|volume=3|issue=2|pages=141–164|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ851577&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ851577|doi=10.1007/s11412-008-9040-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== IT-based text annotation systems ==

IT-based annotation systems include [[Computer software|standalone]] and [[Client-server model|client-server systems]]. In the 1980s and 1990s, a number of such systems were built in the context of [[Library|libraries]], [[patent office]]s, and legal text processing. Their design led researchers to produce [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] of annotation forms.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Catherine C.: [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=263806 Annotation: from paper books to the digital library], Proceedings of the ACM Digital Libraries '97 Conference, Philadelphia, PA.&lt;/ref&gt; Text annotation research has taken place at several institutions, including Xerox research centers in [[PARC (company)|Palo Alto]] and Grenoble (France), the Hitachi Central Research Lab (in particular for annotation of patents), and in relation with the construction of the new French National Library between 1989 and 1995&lt;ref&gt;Virbel, Jacques, Reading and managing texts on the Bibliothèque de France station, The digital word: text-based computing in the humanities book contents, MIT Press 1993, Cambridge, USA, pp 31-51.&lt;/ref&gt; at the Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse and in the company AIS (Advanced Innovation Systems).

Annotation functionality has been present in text processing software for many years through inline notes displayed as pop-ups, footnotes, and endnotes; however, it is only recently that functionality for displaying annotations as marginalia has appeared in programs such as [[OpenOffice.org]]/[[LibreOffice]] Writer and [[Microsoft Word]]. Personal or standalone annotation include word processing software that supports embedded or anchored text annotations as well as [[Adobe Acrobat]], which in addition to commenting allows highlights, stamps, and other types of markup.&lt;ref name="Shabjee and Reynolds" /&gt;

=== Web-based text annotation systems ===
{{main|Web annotation}}
[[Tim Berners-Lee]] had already implemented the concept&lt;ref name="boulton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital-archaeology.org/the-nexus-browser/|title=The Nexus Browser|last=Boulton|first=Jim|date=26 March 2014|accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of directly editing web documents in 1990 in [[WorldWideWeb]], the first web browser,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berners-Lee|first=Tim|title=A Brief History of the Web|url=http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/TimBook-old/History.html|publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]]|accessdate=21 September 2014|authorlink=Tim Berners-Lee|year=1993–1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later ported versions removed this collaborative ability.&lt;ref name="boulton"/&gt; An early version of [[Mosaic (web browser)|NCSA Mosaic]] in 1993 also included a collaborative annotation capability,&lt;ref name="mosaic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inkdroid.org/tmp/www-talk/1192.html|title=Group Annotation Server Guinea Pigs?|last=Andreessen|first=Marc|date=31 May 1993|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it was quickly removed.  Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning, [[WebDAV]], was then reintroduced as an extension.

A different approach to distributed authoring consists in first gathering many annotations from a wide public, and then integrate them all in order to produce a further version of a document.  This approach was pioneered by [[Stet (software)|Stet]], the system put in place to gather comments on drafts of version 3 of the [[GNU General Public License]]. This system arose after a specific requirement, which it served egregiously, but was not so easily configurable as to be convenient for annotating any other document on the web. The [[co-ment]] system uses annotation interface concepts similar to Stet's, but it is based on an entirely new implementation, using [[Django (web framework)|Django]]/[[Python (programming language)|Python]] on the server side and various [[AJAX]] libraries such as [[JQuery]] on the client side. Both Stet and co-ment are licensed under the GNU [[Affero General Public License]].

Since 2011, the non-profit Hypothes Is Project &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Corbin|first=Kenneth|title=IRS Determination Letter|url=https://d242fdlp0qlcia.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/11/03162019/Hypothes.is-501.c3-IRS-Determination-Letter-2013-06-29.pdf|publisher=[[Internal Revenue Service]]|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; has offered the free, open web annotation service [[Hypothes.is]]. The service features annotation via a Chrome extension, bookmarklet or proxy server, as well as integration into a [[Learning management system|LMS]] or [[Content management system|CMS]]. Both [[Web annotation|webpages]] and [[Portable Document Format#Annotation|PDFs]] can be annotated. Other web-based text annotation systems are collaborative software for distributed text editing and versioning, which also feature annotation and commenting interfaces. For example, [http://www.hylighter.com/hybar/site/index.html HyLighter] supports synchronous and asynchronous interactions, general commenting, comment tagging, threaded discussions and comment filtering. Other annotation tools under these category are more focused on [[Natural Language Processing|NLP]] tasks as [[Named-entity recognition]], relationship extraction or [[Canonicalization|normalization]]. Some tools support manual tagging of data or automatic annotations via [[supervised learning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cejuela|first=Juan Miguel|title=tagtog, interactive and text-mining-assisted annotation of gene mentions in PLOS full-text articles|pmc=3978375|publisher=[[Database (journal)|Database: The Journal of Biological Databases and Curation]]|date=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specialized Web-based text annotations exist in the context of scientific publication, either for refereeing or post-publication. The on-line journal [[PLoS ONE]], published by the [[Public Library of Science]], has developed its own Web-based system where scientists and the public can comment on published articles. The annotations are displayed as pop-ups with an anchor in the text.
