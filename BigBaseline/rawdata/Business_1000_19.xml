A specialist form of [[business intelligence]], '''accounting intelligence''' is the general name for the set of technologies used to extract, analyse and present information from accounting and [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] applications such as [[JD Edwards]], [[Oracle E-Business Suite]] or [[SAP AG|SAP]].

==Accounting intelligence compared to business intelligence==
Accounting intelligence differs from standard business intelligence in some key ways:-

* Accounting intelligence applications are specifically designed to analyse data from specific ERP systems. Business intelligence is a more general tool that can be applied to any application that uses a database.
* In an accounting intelligence, there is no staggering of data in a [[data warehouse]] or [[OLAP]] cube. Information is extracted directly from the ERP at the time that a query is run.  A Business Intelligence application typically involves a batch process to extract data from the live database, and store it in a denormalised form. This process is normally referred to as [[extract, transform, load]], or ETL. Typically around 75-80% of the development cost expended when creating a business intelligence system, goes into the design and development of the ETL process.
* Accounting intelligence applications leverage the structure of the chart of accounts and other dimensions, so for example dimension structures can be automatically created based on inbuilt hierarchies, level of detail or account category codes. Time-based functions specifically allow for Year to Date, Cumulative, Period, rolling average and year on year analysis.
* Querying an accounts database directly means the information returned is up to the second real time data.  Discrepancies in the accounts can be corrected and a fresh trial balance, P&amp;L or Balance Sheet viewed immediately. Some aggregation in accounting systems is performed by the ERP when new journal entries are posted, so there is no need to use a cube to aggregate every journal entry from scratch.
* As there is no ETL process, accounting intelligence solutions are typically much simpler to install, implement and maintain than traditional business intelligence solutions. Inquiries and reports typically created by end users rather than software developers.
* Accounting intelligence solutions can make [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act|SOX]] compliance easier for many companies, as there is no need to separately audit both the accounts themselves and a separate data warehouse and ETL process.

'''Key advantages compared to business intelligence'''

* Accounting intelligence system ensures that an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system is the single source of all operational reporting and analysis, and that it can be relied upon to give accurate and secure information.
* Out of the box solution, much quicker to implement than a standard BI solution.
* As there is no data warehouse, there is no need to separately audit the staged data.
* Data returned is real time, live data, not a snapshot.

'''Key disadvantages compared to business intelligence'''

* Can only be applied to specific ERP systems, such as JDE, Oracle E-Business and SAP.
* Can not integrate data from outside the ERP system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1947">{{Banking |image=London.bankofengland.arp.jpg |caption=The [[Bank of England]], established in 1694.}}A '''banker's lien''' is a legal right arise in many [[common law jurisdictions]] of a [[bank]] to exercise a [[lien]] over any property in the custody of the bank as security for the indebtedness of the customer to the bank.&lt;ref name=Ellinger&gt;{{cite book |author1=E.P.

==Scope==
The precise effect of a banker's lien varies according to the laws of a particular jurisdiction.  Under English common law it applies to all property coming into the possession of the bank in the usual course of banking business,&lt;ref&gt;''Brandao v Barnett'' (1846) 12 Cl 7 F 787&lt;/ref&gt; subject to the important exception that it does not apply to property which is deposited with the bank for safe custody.&lt;ref&gt;''Leese v Martin'' (1873) LR 17 Eq 224 at 235.  The bank holds such property as [[bailment|bailee]], and may be entitled to exercise a separate lien as such.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst most common law liens normally only give the lienee a passive right to retain the property, unusually, the banker's lien permits the bank the sell the relevant property.&lt;ref&gt;''Rosenberg v International Banking Corporation'' (1923) 14 Ll LR 344 at 347&lt;/ref&gt;

The lien does not generally extend to intangible rights, including credit balances on accounts.  However those credit balances may be subject to the [[banker's right to combine accounts]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[National Westminster Bank Ltd v Halesowen Presswork &amp; Assemblies Ltd]]'' [1972] AC 785&lt;/ref&gt;

The banker's lien may be modified or abrogated by agreement.&lt;ref name=Ellinger /&gt;

'''Bill of IT''' is an exhaustive list of IT [[asset]]s and services owned by a company. The bill displays a breakdown of all the IT assets and services in relation to various items.The bill is often used by companies as a [[IT chargeback and showback|chargeback and showback]] tool because it shows the relation between specific service/asset and employee, cost center, department, location, line of business, etc. It allows companies to see what they own and how their resources are allocated in the organizations. Most bills of IT show the following element (among other details):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.cimpl.com/what-is-a-bill-of-it-and-why-is-it-important|title=What is a Bill of IT and Why is it Important?|last=Cheang|first=Henry|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Cost - What each asset/service cost (price per unit)
* Price- The price of each service/asset multiply by the quantity of service/asset (predefined unit rate)
* Budget -The full budget (cost) associated with the use of this service/asset for a year or any chosen reporting period
* Quality -The quality of the service/asset is shown through various metrics: uptime, response time (with support), etc.
* Benchmarking - Comparison of this service/asset to the company’s benchmarks (use, efficiency, etc.)

Ultimately, the goal of a bill of IT is to clarify IT investments in an organization by presenting a detailed view of IT expenses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3174">A '''business alliance''' is an agreement between businesses, usually motivated by [[cost reduction]] and improved service for the customer. Alliances are often bounded by a single agreement with [[Equity (economics)|equitable]] [[risk]] and opportunity share for all parties involved and are typically managed by an integrated project team. An example of this is [[code sharing]] in [[airline alliance]]s.

==Types==
There are five basic categories or types of alliances:&lt;ref name="Kuglin"&gt;{{cite book| last = Kuglin | first = F.A. | authorlink = |author2=J. Hook | title = Building, Leading, and Managing Strategic Alliances: How to Work Effectively and Profitably With Partner Companies | publisher = American Management Association | date = 2002 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Sales: A sales alliance occurs when two companies agree to go to market together to sell complementary products and services. 
*Solution-specific: A solution-specific alliance occurs when two companies agree to jointly develop and sell a specific marketplace solution. 
*Geographic-specific:  A geographic-specific alliance is developed when two companies agree to jointly market or [[co-brand]] their products and services in a specific geographic region.
*Investment: An investment alliance occurs when two companies agree to join their funds for mutual investment. 
*Joint venture: A [[joint venture]] is an alliance that occurs when two or more companies agree to undertake economic activity together.

In many cases, alliances between companies can involve two or more categories or types of alliances.

== Horizontal alliances ==

A type of an alliance is a horizontal alliance. For example, a horizontal alliance can occur between [[logistics |logistics service providers]], i.e., the cooperation between two or more logistics companies that are potentially competing.&lt;ref name="rauewieland"&gt;Raue, J.S. &amp; Wieland, A. (2015), [http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1108/IJLM-08-2012-0083 The interplay of different types of governance in horizontal cooperations: a view on logistics service providers]. The International Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 26, No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In a horizontal alliance, these partners can benefit twofold. On one hand, they can "access tangible resources which are directly exploitable." In this example extending common transportation networks, their warehouse infrastructure and the ability to provide more complex service packages can be achieved by combining resources. On the other hand, partners can "access intangible resources, which are not directly exploitable." This typically includes know-how and information and, in turn, innovation.&lt;ref name="rauewieland"/&gt;

'''Business communication''' is [[information sharing]] between people within and outside an organization that is performed for the commercial benefit of the organization. It can also be defined as relaying of information within a [[business]] by its people.

==Overview==

Business communication (or simply "communication," in a business context) encompasses topics such as [[marketing]], [[brand management]], [[customer relations]], [[consumer behavior]], [[advertising]], [[public relations]], [[Organizational communication|corporate communication]], [[community]] engagement, [[reputation management]], [[interpersonal communication]], [[employee engagement]], and [[event management]]. It is closely related to the fields of [[professional communication]] and [[technical communication]].

Media channels for business communication include the [[Internet]], [[print media]], [[radio]], [[television]], [[ambient media]], and [[word of mouth]].

Business communication can also be said to be the way employees, management and administration communicate in order to reach to their organizational goals.

Business communication is a common topic included in the curricular of Undergraduate and Master's degree programs at many colleges and universities.

Methods of business communication include: 
*[[Web-based]] communication;
*[[Video conferencing]] – allows people in different locations to hold interactive meetings;
*[[Report]]s – important in documenting the activities of any department;
*[[Presentation]]s – popular method of communication in  all types of organizations, usually involving audiovisual material, like copies of reports, or material prepared in [[Microsoft PowerPoint]] or [[Adobe Flash]];
*[[Telephone]] meetings – which allow for long distance [[speech]];
*Forum boards – which allow people to instantly post information at a centralized location;
*Face-to-face meetings – which are personal and should have a written followup;
*Suggestion box – primarily for [[upward communication]], because some people may hesitate to communicate with management directly, so they can give suggestions by drafting one and putting it in the suggestion box.

== Organizations ==
*Founded in 1936 by Shankar is the Association for Business Communication (ABC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesscommunication.org/index.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812141734/http://www.businesscommunication.org/index.asp |archivedate=2007-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; originally called the Association of College Teachers of Business Writing, is "an international organization committed to fostering excellence in business communication scholarship,research ,education, and practice."
*The IEEE Professional Communication Society (PCS) [http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/pcs/] is dedicated to understanding and promoting effective communication in engineering, scientific, and other environments, including business environments. PCS's academic journal,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/pcs/?q=node/24 IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication]&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the premier journals in Europe communication. The journal’s readers are engineers, writers, information designers, managers, and others working as scholars, educators, and practitioners who share an interest in the effective communication of technical and business information.
*The [[Society for Technical Communication]] is a professional association dedicated to the advancement of the theory and practice of technical communication. With membership of more than 6,000 technical communicators, it's the largest organization of its type in North America.
*The [[International Business Communication Standards]] are practical proposals for the conceptual and visual design of comprehensible reports and presentations.

'''Business intelligence''' ('''BI''') comprises the strategies and technologies used by enterprises for the [[data analysis]] of [[business information]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Dedić N. &amp; Stanier C.|year=2016|title=Measuring the Success of Changes to Existing Business Intelligence Solutions to Improve Business Intelligence Reporting.

Common functions of business intelligence technologies include [[business reporting|reporting]], [[online analytical processing]], [[analytics]], [[data mining]], [[process mining]], [[complex event processing]], [[business performance management]], [[benchmarking]], [[text mining]], [[Predictive Analysis|predictive analytics]] and [[Prescriptive Analytics|prescriptive analytics]]. BI technologies can handle large amounts of structured and sometimes unstructured data to help identify, develop and otherwise create new strategic [[business opportunities]]. They aim to allow for the easy interpretation of these [[big data]]. Identifying new opportunities and implementing an effective strategy based on [[insight]]s can provide [[business]]es with a competitive market advantage and long-term stability.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite book |title= Business Intelligence Success Factors: Tools for Aligning Your Business in the Global Economy |last= Rud|first= Olivia |year= 2009|publisher= Wiley &amp; Sons|location= Hoboken, N.J|isbn= 978-0-470-39240-9 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Business intelligence can be used by enterprises to support a wide range of business decisions ranging from operational to strategic. Basic operating decisions include product positioning or pricing.  [[Business strategy|Strategic business]] decisions involve priorities, [[goal]]s and directions at the broadest level. In all cases, BI is most effective when it combines data derived from the market in which a [[company]] operates (external data) with data from company sources internal to the business such as financial and operations data (internal data). When combined, external and internal data can provide a complete picture which, in effect, creates an "intelligence" that cannot be derived from any singular set of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1= Coker| first1= Frank | title= Pulse: Understanding the Vital Signs of Your Business | publisher= Ambient Light Publishing

or as "BIDW". A data warehouse contains a copy of analytical data that facilitate [[decision support]].

==History==
The earliest known use of the term ''business intelligence'' is in Richard Millar Devens' ''Cyclopædia of Commercial and Business Anecdotes'' (1865). Devens used the term to describe how the banker [[Sir Henry Furnese, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Furnese]] gained profit by receiving and acting upon information about his environment, prior to his competitors:
{{quote|Throughout Holland, Flanders, France, and Germany, he maintained a complete and perfect train of business intelligence. The news of the many battles fought was thus received first by him, and the [[Siege of Namur (1695)|fall of Namur]] added to his profits, owing to his early receipt of the news.|author=Devens |source=p.&amp;nbsp;210}}

The ability to collect and react accordingly based on the information retrieved, Devens says, is central to business intelligence.&lt;ref name="Miller Devens"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller Devens|first=Richard|title=Cyclopaedia of Commercial and Business Anecdotes; Comprising Interesting Reminiscences and Facts, Remarkable Traits and Humors of Merchants, Traders, Bankers Etc. in All Ages and Countries|url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=9MspAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA210&amp;dq=%22business+intelligence%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=a5EPTdaRIsOWnAeVyYHQDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22business%20intelligence%22&amp;f=false|publisher=D. Appleton and company|accessdate=15 February 2014|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Hans Peter Luhn]], a researcher at [[IBM]], used the term ''business intelligence'' in an article published in 1958, he employed the ''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'' definition of intelligence: "the ability to apprehend the interrelationships of presented facts in such a way as to guide action towards a desired goal."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|url= http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/024/ibmrd0204H.pdf|doi=10.1147/rd.24.0314|title= A Business Intelligence System|author=H P Luhn |authorlink= Hans Peter Luhn |year= 1958 |journal= IBM Journal|volume= 2|issue= 4|pages= 314|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913121526/http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/024/ibmrd0204H.pdf|archivedate=2008-09-13}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Business intelligence as it is understood today is said to have evolved from the [[decision support system]]s (DSS) that began in the 1960s and developed throughout the mid-1980s.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} DSS originated in the computer-aided models created to assist with [[decision making]] and planning.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In 1989, Howard Dresner (later a [[Gartner]] analyst) proposed ''business intelligence'' as an [[umbrella term]] to describe "concepts and methods to improve business decision making by using fact-based support systems."&lt;ref name=power&gt;{{cite web |url= http://dssresources.com/history/dsshistory.html |title= A Brief History of Decision Support Systems, version 4.0 |accessdate=10 July 2008 |author= D. J. Power |date= 10 March 2007|publisher= DSSResources.COM }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the late 1990s that this usage was widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dssresources.com/history/dsshistory.html |title=A Brief History of Decision Support Systems |last=Power |first=D. J. |accessdate=1 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics{{who|date=August 2018}} see BI merely as an evolution of [[business reporting]] together with the advent of increasingly powerful and easy-to-use [[data analysis]] tools. In this respect it has also been criticized{{by whom|date=August 2018}} as a marketing buzzword in the context of the "[[big data]]" surge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decoding big data buzzwords|year=2015|quote=BI refers to the approaches, tools, mechanisms that organizations can use to keep a finger on the pulse of their businesses. Also referred by unsexy versions -- “dashboarding”, “MIS” or “reporting.”|publisher=cio.com|url=http://www.cio.com/article/2919082/big-data/what-are-they-talking-about-decoding-big-data-buzzwords.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
According to [[Forrester Research]], business intelligence is "a set of methodologies, processes, architectures, and technologies that transform raw data into meaningful and useful information used to enable more effective strategic, tactical, and operational insights and decision-making."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forrester.com/report/Topic+Overview+Business+Intelligence/-/E-RES39218 |title=Topic Overview: Business Intelligence |last=Evelson |first=Boris |date=21 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this definition, business intelligence encompasses [[information management]] ([[data integration]], [[data quality]], data warehousing, master-data management, text- and content-analytics, et al.). Therefore, Forrester refers to ''data preparation'' and ''data usage'' as two separate but closely linked segments of the business-intelligence architectural stack.

Some elements of business intelligence are:{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

* Multidimensional [[Aggregate (data warehouse)|aggregation]] and allocation
* [[Denormalization]], tagging, and standardization
* Realtime reporting with analytical alert
* A method of interfacing with [[unstructured data]] sources
* Group consolidation, budgeting and [[rolling forecast]]s
* [[Statistical inference]] and probabilistic simulation
* [[Key performance indicator]]s optimization
* Version control and process management
* Open item management

Forrester distinguishes this from the ''business-intelligence market'', which is "just the top layers of the BI architectural stack, such as [[Data reporting|reporting]], [[analytics]], and [[Dashboards (management information systems)|dashboards]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://blogs.forrester.com/boris_evelson/10-04-29-want_know_what_forresters_lead_data_analysts_are_thinking_about_bi_and_data_domain
|title=Want to know what Forrester's lead data analysts are thinking about BI and the data domain? |last=Evelson |first=Boris |date=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compared with competitive intelligence===
Though the term business intelligence is sometimes a synonym for [[competitive intelligence]] (because they both support [[decision making]]), BI uses technologies, processes, and applications to analyze mostly internal, structured data and business processes while competitive intelligence gathers, analyzes and disseminates information with a topical focus on company competitors. If understood broadly, business intelligence can include the subset of competitive intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.forrester.com/james_kobielus/10-04-30-what%E2%80%99s_not_bi_oh_don%E2%80%99t_get_me_startedoops_too_latehere_goes |title=What’s Not BI? Oh, Don’t Get Me Started....Oops Too Late...Here Goes.... |last=Kobielus |first=James |date=30 April 2010 |quote=“Business” intelligence is a non-domain-specific catchall for all the types of analytic data that can be delivered to users in reports, dashboards, and the like. When you specify the subject domain for this intelligence, then you can refer to “competitive intelligence,” “market intelligence,” “social intelligence,” “financial intelligence,” “HR intelligence,” “supply chain intelligence,” and the like.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compared with business analytics===
Business intelligence and [[business analytics]] are sometimes used interchangeably, but there are alternate definitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timoelliott.com/blog/2011/03/business-analytics-vs-business-intelligence.html |title=Business Analytics vs Business Intelligence? |publisher=timoelliott.com |date=2011-03-09 |accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas H. Davenport|Thomas Davenport]], professor of information technology and management at [[Babson College]] argues that business intelligence should be divided into [[Information retrieval|querying]], [[Business reporting|reporting]], [[Online analytical processing]] (OLAP), an "alerts" tool, and business analytics. In this definition, business analytics is the subset of BI focusing on statistics, prediction, and optimization, rather than the reporting functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite interview |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/bi/222200096 |title=Analytics at Work: Q&amp;A with Tom Davenport |last=Henschen |first=Doug |date=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components of the BI landscape==
The Business Intelligence landscape reflects the complex system which data goes through in order to get processed into information. One of the first steps of starting a BI program, is to understand all components of this landscape. The particularities of this system tend to differ based on the industry and organization, but at a macro level, all BI landscapes have the same format. It’s usually composed of five pillars and five foundation blocks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lightsondata.com/business-intelligence-landscape-components/|title=10 components of the Business Intelligence landscape - LightsOnData|date=2018-07-04|work=LightsOnData|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

The five pillars:

# Data source(s)
# Data integration
# Data management
# Reports 
# Information dissemination

The five foundation blocks:

# Information security
# Data quality
# Metadata management
# Data governance
# People &amp; culture

==Data==
Business operations can generate a very large amount of information in the form of e-mails, memos, notes from call-centers, news, user groups, chats, reports, web-pages, presentations, image-files, video-files, and marketing material. According to [[Merrill Lynch]], more than 85% of all business information exists in these forms; a company might only use such a document a single time.&lt;ref name = rao&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/MITP.2003.1254966 |url=http://www.ramanarao.com/papers/rao-itpro-2003-11.pdf|title=From unstructured data to actionable intelligence|year=2003|last1=Rao|first1=R.|journal=IT Professional|volume=5|issue=6|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the way it is produced and stored, this information is either [[Unstructured data|unstructured]] or [[semi-structured data|semi-structured]].

The management of semi-structured data is an unsolved problem in the information technology industry.&lt;ref name=blumberg&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://soquelgroup.com/Articles/dmreview_0203_problem.pdf|author1=Blumberg, R.|author2=S. Atre|lastauthoramp=yes|title=The Problem with Unstructured Data|journal=DM Review|year=2003|pages=42–46|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125033210/http://soquelgroup.com/Articles/dmreview_0203_problem.pdf|archivedate=25 January 2011|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to projections from Gartner (2003), white collar workers spend 30–40% of their time searching, finding, and assessing unstructured data. BI uses both structured and unstructured data. The former is easy to search, and the latter contains a large quantity of the information needed for analysis and decision making.&lt;ref name = blumberg /&gt;&lt;ref name = negash&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://site.xavier.edu/sena/info600/businessintelligence.pdf|author=Negash, S |title=Business Intelligence|journal= Communications of the Association of Information Systems|volume=13|year= 2004|pages=177–195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the difficulty of properly searching, finding and assessing unstructured or semi-structured data, organizations may not draw upon these vast reservoirs of information, which could influence a particular decision, task or project. This can ultimately lead to poorly informed decision making.&lt;ref name = rao /&gt;

Therefore, when designing a business intelligence/DW-solution, the specific problems associated with semi-structured and unstructured data must be accommodated for as well as those for the structured data.&lt;ref name = negash /&gt;

===Unstructured data vs. semi-structured data===
Unstructured and semi-structured data have different meanings depending on their context. In the context of relational database systems, unstructured data cannot be stored in predictably ordered [[columns]] and [[Row (database)|rows]]. One type of unstructured data is typically stored in a [[BLOB]] (binary large object), a catch-all data type available in most [[relational database]] management systems. Unstructured data may also refer to irregularly or randomly repeated (nonrepetitive) column patterns that vary from row to row within each file or document.&lt;ref name="InmonUntang14"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibmbigdatahub.com/blog/untangling-definition-unstructured-data |title=Untangling the Definition of Unstructured Data |author=Inmon, W.H. |work=Big Data &amp; Analytics Hub |publisher=IBM |date=25 July 2014 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these data types, however, like e-mails, word processing text files, PPTs, image-files, and video-files conform to a standard that offers the possibility of metadata. Metadata can include information such as author and time of creation, and this can be stored in a relational database.
Therefore, it may be more accurate to talk about this as semi-structured documents or data,&lt;ref name = blumberg /&gt; but no specific consensus seems to have been reached.

Unstructured data can also simply be the knowledge that business users have about future business trends. Business forecasting naturally aligns with the BI system because business users think of their business in aggregate terms. Capturing the business knowledge that may only exist in the minds of business users provides some of the most important data points for a complete BI solution.

===Limitations of semi-structured and unstructured data===
There are several challenges to developing BI with semi-structured data. According to Inmon &amp; Nesavich,&lt;ref name = inmon&gt;Inmon, B. &amp; A. Nesavich, "Unstructured Textual Data in the Organization" from "Managing Unstructured data in the organization", Prentice Hall 2008, pp. 1–13&lt;/ref&gt; some of those are:

* Physically accessing unstructured textual data&amp;nbsp;– unstructured data is stored in a huge variety of formats.
* [[Terminology]]&amp;nbsp;– Among researchers and analysts, there is a need to develop a standardized terminology.
* Volume of data&amp;nbsp;– As stated earlier, up to 85% of all data exists as semi-structured data. Couple that with the need for word-to-word and semantic analysis.
* Searchability of unstructured textual data&amp;nbsp;– A simple search on some data, e.g. apple, results in links where there is a reference to that precise search term. (Inmon &amp; Nesavich, 2008)&lt;ref name = inmon /&gt; gives an example: “a search is made on the term felony. In a simple search, the term felony is used, and everywhere there is a reference to felony, a hit to an unstructured document is made. But a simple search is crude. It does not find references to crime, arson, murder, embezzlement, vehicular homicide, and such, even though these crimes are types of felonies.”

===Metadata===
To solve problems with searchability and assessment of data, it is necessary to know something about the content. This can be done by adding context through the use of [[metadata]].&lt;ref name = rao /&gt; Many systems already capture some metadata (e.g. filename, author, size, etc.), but more useful would be metadata about the actual content&amp;nbsp;– e.g. summaries, topics, people or companies mentioned. Two technologies designed for generating metadata about content are automatic categorization and [[information extraction]].

==Applications==
Business intelligence can be applied to the following business purposes:&lt;ref name="FeldmanDeveloping13"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xDXfeopC-kMC&amp;pg=PA140 |title=Developing Business Intelligence Apps for SharePoint |author=Feldman, D.; Himmelstein, J. |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc |pages=140–1 |year=2013 |isbn=9781449324681 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Performance metrics]] and [[benchmarking]] inform business leaders of progress towards business goals ([[business process management]]).
* [[Analytics]] quantify processes for a business to arrive at optimal decisions, and to perform business knowledge discovery. Analytics may variously involve [[data mining]], [[process mining]], [[statistical analysis]], [[predictive analytics]], [[predictive modeling]], [[business process modeling]], [[data lineage]], [[complex event processing]] and [[prescriptive analytics]].
* [[Business reporting]] can use BI data to inform strategy. Business reporting may involve [[data visualization]], [[executive information system]], and/or [[OLAP]]
* BI can facilitate [[collaboration]] both inside and outside the business by enabling [[data sharing]] and [[electronic data interchange]]
* [[Knowledge management]] is concerned with the creation, distribution, use, and management of business intelligence, and of business knowledge in general. Knowledge management leads to [[learning management]] and [[regulatory compliance]].

==Marketplace==
In a 2013 report, Gartner categorized business intelligence vendors as either an independent "pure-play" vendor or a consolidated "megavendor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/gartner-releases-2013-bi-magic-quadrant-7000011264/ |title=Gartner releases 2013 BI Magic Quadrant |publisher=ZDNet |author=Andrew Brust| date= 2013-02-14|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bi-verdict.com/fileadmin/FreeAnalyses/consolidations.htm |title=Consolidations in the BI industry |date=7 March 2008 |last=Pendse |first=Nigel |work=The OLAP Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 business intelligence services received $13.1 billion in revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gartner Says Worldwide Business Intelligence, CPM and Analytic Applications/Performance Management Software Market Grew Seven Percent in 2012 |url=http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2507915 |website=Gartner.com |accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical predictions===
A 2009 paper predicted&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=856714 Gartner Reveals Five Business Intelligence Predictions for 2009 and Beyond]. gartner.com. 15 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; these developments in the business intelligence market:

* Because of lack of information, processes, and tools, through 2012, more than 35 percent of the top 5,000 global companies regularly fail to make insightful decisions about significant changes in their business and markets.
* By 2012, business units will control at least 40 percent of the total budget for business intelligence.
* By 2012, one-third of analytic applications applied to business processes will be delivered through [[Granularity|coarse-grained]] application [[mashup (web application hybrid)|mashups]].

A 2009 ''Information Management'' special report predicted the top BI trends: "[[green computing]], [[social networking service]]s, [[data visualization]], [[Mobile business intelligence|mobile BI]], [[predictive analytics]], [[composite application]]s, [[cloud computing]] and [[Multi-touch|multitouch]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.information-management.com/specialreports/2009_148/business_intelligence_data_vizualization_social_networking_analytics-10015628-1.html |title=10 Red Hot BI Trends |last=Campbell |first=Don |date=23 June 2009 |work=Information Management}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research undertaken in 2014 indicated that employees are more likely to have access to, and more likely to engage with, cloud-based BI tools than traditional tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aberdeen.com/Aberdeen-Library/8906/RR-analytics-cloud-saas-bi.aspx |title=Cloud Analytics in 2014: Infusing the Workforce with Insight |last=Lock|first=Michael|date=27 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other business intelligence trends include the following:
* Third party SOA-BI products increasingly address [[Extract, transform, load|ETL]] issues of volume and throughput.
* Companies embrace in-memory processing, 64-bit processing, and pre-packaged analytic BI applications.
* Operational applications have callable BI components, with improvements in response time, scaling, and concurrency.
* Near or real time BI analytics is a baseline expectation.
* Open source BI software replaces vendor offerings.

Other lines of research include the combined study of business intelligence and uncertain data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Instead, data is considered uncertain and therefore this uncertainty is propagated to the results produced by BI.

According to a study by the Aberdeen Group, there has been increasing interest in [[Software-as-a-Service]] (SaaS) business intelligence over the past years, with twice as many organizations using this deployment approach as one year ago&amp;nbsp;– 15% in 2009 compared to 7% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Julian|first1=Taylor|title=Business intelligence implementation according to customer's needs|url=http://apro-software.com/services/software-development/business-intelligence|publisher=APRO Software|accessdate=16 May 2016|date=10 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article by InfoWorld's Chris Kanaracus points out similar growth data from research firm IDC, which predicts the SaaS BI market will grow 22 percent each year through 2013 thanks to increased product sophistication, strained IT budgets, and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://infoworld.com/d/cloud-computing/saas-bi-growth-will-soar-in-2010-511 SaaS BI growth will soar in 2010 | Cloud Computing].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10184">In computer [[software]], '''business logic''' or '''domain logic''' is the part of the program that encodes the real-world [[business rule]]s that determine how data can be [[Create, read, update and delete|created, stored, and changed]].  It is contrasted with the remainder of the software that might be concerned with lower-level details of managing a [[database]] or displaying the [[user interface]], system infrastructure, or generally connecting various parts of the program.

==Details and example==
Business logic:
* Prescribes how [[business objects]] interact with one another
* Enforces the routes and the methods by which business objects are accessed and updated

Business rules:
* Model [[Real life|real-life]] business objects (such as accounts, loans, itineraries, and inventories)

Business logic comprises:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebizq.net/topics/bpm/features/5757.html?&amp;pp=1|title=The Challenge of BPM Adoption|date=2005-03-27|author=Steven Minsky|publisher=eBizQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Workflow]]s that are the ordered tasks of passing documents or data from one participant (a person or a software system) to another.

Business logic should be distinguished from business rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?BusinessLogicDefinition|title=Definition of business logic|date=2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Business logic is the portion of an enterprise system which determines how data is transformed or calculated, and how it is routed to people or software (workflow). Business rules are formal expressions of business policy. Anything that is a process or procedure is business logic, and anything that is neither a process nor a procedure is a business rule. Welcoming a new visitor is a process (workflow) consisting of steps to be taken, whereas saying every new visitor must be welcomed is a business rule. Further, business logic is procedural whereas business rules are declarative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omg.org/news/meetings/tc/mn/special-events/br/Ulrich.pdf|author=William Ulrich|title=OMG Business Rules Symposium|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224094752/http://www.omg.org/news/meetings/tc/mn/special-events/br/Ulrich.pdf|archivedate=2013-12-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, an [[e-commerce]] website might allow visitors to add items to a shopping cart, specify a shipping address, and supply payment information.  The business logic of the website might include a workflow such as:
* The sequence of events that happens during checkout, for example a multi-page form which first asks for the shipping address, then for the billing address, next page will contain the payment method, and last page will show congratulations.

There will be also business rules of the website:
* Adding an item more than once from the item description page increments the quantity for that item.
* Specific formats that the visitor's address, email address, and credit card information must follow.

The web site software also contains other code which is not considered part of business logic nor business rules:
* Peripheral content not related to the core business data, such as the [[HTML]] that defines the colors, appearance, background image, and navigational structure of the site
* Generic error-handling code (e.g. which displays the HTTP Error Code 500 page)
* Initialization code that runs when the web server starts up the site, which sets up the system
* Monitoring infrastructure to make sure all the parts of the site are working properly (e.g. the billing system is available)
* Generic code for making network connections, transmitting objects to the [[database]], parsing user input via HTTP POST events, etc.

==Business logic and tiers/layers==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2018}}
[[Image:Overview of a three-tier application vectorVersion.svg|thumb|right|Business logic in theory occupies the middle tier of a 3-tier architecture.]]

Business logic could be anywhere in a program.  For example, given a certain format for an address, a database table could be created which has columns that correspond exactly to the fields specified in the business logic, and type checks added to make sure that no invalid data is added.

Business logic often changes.  For example, the set of allowable address formats might change when an online retailer starts shipping products to a new country.  Thus it is often seen as desirable to make the code that implements the business logic relatively isolated, or [[coupling (computer science)|loosely coupled]].  This makes it more likely that changes to business logic will require a small set of code changes, in only one part of the code.  Distant but strongly coupled code also creates more of a risk that the programmer will only make some of the necessary changes and miss part of the system, leading to incorrect operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.awprofessional.com/articles/article.aspx?p=24260&amp;seqNum=3|chapter=Introduction to Enterprise Software|author1=Khawar Zaman Ahmed  |author2=Cary E. Umrysh |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Addison-Wesley|date=2001-10-17|isbn=0-201-73829-5|title=Developing Enterprise Java Applications with J2EE and UML}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[multitier architecture]] formalizes this decoupling by creating a '''business logic layer''' which is separate from other tiers or layers, such as the [[data access layer]] or [[service layer]].  Each layer "knows" only a minimal amount about the code in the other layers - just enough to accomplish necessary tasks. For example, in a [[model–view–controller]] paradigm, the controller and view layers, might be made as small as possible, with all the business logic concentrated in the model.  In the e-commerce example, the controller determines the sequence of web pages in the checkout sequence, and is also responsible for validating that email, address, and payment information satisfy the business rules (rather than leaving any of that up to the database itself or lower-level database access code).

Alternative paradigms are possible.  For example, with relatively simple business entities, a generic view and controller could access database objects which themselves contain all the relevant business logic about what formats they accept and what changes are possible (known as the [[database model]]).

Some tiered schemes use either a distinct [[application layer]] or a [[service layer]], or consider the business logic layer to be the same as one of those.

==Tools and techniques==
Business logic can be extracted from procedural code using a [[business rule management system]] (BRMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bring business logic to light: JRules 4.5 tames business rules with friendly tools|author=James Owen|publisher=JavaWorld|date=2003-09-19|url=http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-09-2003/jw-0919-iw-jrules.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[business rules approach]] of software development uses BRMSs and enforces a very strong separation of business logic from other code.  [[User interface management systems]] are another technology used to enforce a strong separation between business logic and other code.  The [[magic pushbutton]] is considered an "anti-pattern": a technique that in this case creates undesirable constraints which make it difficult to code business logic in an easy-to-maintain way.

A [[domain model]] is an abstract representation of the data storage types required by business rules.

'''Busy work''' (also referred to as '''make-work''' and '''busywork''') can refer to activity that is undertaken to pass time and stay busy but in and of itself has no actual value.  Busy work also occurs in business, military and other settings, in situations where people may be required to be present but may lack the opportunities, skills or need to do something more productive. People may engage in busy work to maintain an appearance of activity, in order to avoid criticism of being inactive or idle. The Merriam Webster dictionary defines busywork as "work that usually appears productive or of intrinsic value but actually only keeps one occupied." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/busywork|title=Definition of BUSYWORK|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational settings==
In the context of education, busy work allows students to work independently, to test their own knowledge and skills, and to practice using new skills [[Learning|learned]] in the educational setting.&lt;ref name="BostonPTA"&gt;(1901) [https://books.google.com/books?id=n2BMAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Plans for busy work - Boston Primary Teachers' Association - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It can consist of various types of [[schoolwork]] assigned by a teacher to keep students occupied with activities involving learning and cognition while the teacher focuses upon another group of students.&lt;ref name="BostonPTA"/&gt; The functionality of busy work is associated with levels of interest students have with the content of the work, levels of enjoyment students have in performing the work, how purposeful the work is, and how accomplishment of the work is perceived by students.&lt;ref name="BostonPTA"/&gt; The perceived results of the work by students is significant: when students feel that they've succeeded in accomplishing a functional task, it's congruent with learning and the attainment of new skills.&lt;ref name="BostonPTA"/&gt;

Busy work can also be used to keep the students occupied with educational tasks during idle times, such as instances when time in school remains but the day's curriculum has already concluded.&lt;ref name="BostonPTA"/&gt;  This application of busy work to consume idle time was common in [[primary education]], but the need for work to have educational content, rather than existing just to consume time, is now preferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=475 |chapter=Busy work |author=[[Paul Monroe]] |title=A Cyclopedia of Education |year=1910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Busy work has historical precedent in [[primary education]]. Conditioning students to believe that busy work carries the same value as progressive work can lead to students maintaining this belief later in life, carrying it through to the workplace.

==Business and work settings==
[[File:Lightmatter paperwork.jpg|thumb|The constant processing of [[wikt:paperwork|paperwork]] can be a form of busy work, particularly in situations when it is a lower priority compared to other tasks.]]
In business and work settings, people may engage in busy work simply to appear like they're being busy and productive, with the primary goal of actually simply maintaining an ''appearance'' of activity in efforts to protect their employment status (to avoid [[termination of employment|termination]] or sanctions).&lt;ref name="Slack"&gt;(2001) [https://books.google.com/books?id=3AuP7HV14SYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency - Tom DeMarco - Google Books &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Workers believe that it is more important to maintain a constant appearance of working urgently so that they and others believe that what is being done is important. Constant urgency in workers can lead to disproportionate distribution of actual work, as workers may put off important work by attempting to complete previously-designated less important work. Maintaining very high levels of constant busyness may actually be detrimental to the operations of a business or organization in which new tasks are not undertaken in a timely manner because workers are always very busy.&lt;ref name="Slack"/&gt; That can also lead to workers taking shortcuts to accomplish tasks more quickly, which can negatively affect the quality of work results.&lt;ref name="Slack"/&gt; Busy work also can be counterproductive in work settings because it may not be aligned with the overall objectives and priorities of an organization's plans for attaining and maintaining success in its ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkotter/2012/01/19/why-busy-work-doesnt-work/ | title=Why Busy Work Doesn't Work | publisher=Forbes Magazine | date=January 19, 2012 | accessdate=September 1, 2012 | author=Kotter, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption that activity in the workplace is more important than productivity in the workplace can lead to employees thinking that quantity of work is better than quality of work, which is not productive to the overall functioning of a business.

==Military settings==
Busy work is used in armed forces to keep servicemembers from becoming bored, inactive and idle.  Tasks of this sort include [[military parade|drill]], memorizing regulations, getting haircuts, [[spit and polish]]ing footwear and other cleaning chores such as [[holystone|scrubbing the deck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=356 |title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Daily Life in America: The War of Independence and antebellum expansion and reform, 1763-1861 |author=Randall M.

==Overview==

=== Origin ===
Coakes and Smith (2007) define '''Communities of Innovation''' ('''CoI''') as a form of [[Communities of Practice]] that are dedicated to the support of [[innovation]]. They suggest that CoI can be formed from champions of innovation and their [[social network]] and that CoI are safe places for the creation and support of innovatory ideas.&lt;ref name="Coakes and Smith (2007)"/&gt; COI  are groups made up of motivated individuals working together towards a common goal, not because of orders from their superiors, but because they are convinced of their common cause.&lt;ref name="Grimaldi and Rogo (2009)"/&gt;

=== Development ===

==== Communities of Creation ====
Sawhney and Prandelli (2000) proposed the model of Communities of Creation as a new governance mechanism for managing knowledge found in different companies for the purpose of innovation. Intellectual property rights are considered to be owned by the entire community although the community is governed by a central firm which acts as the sponsor and defines the ground rules for participation. This model lies between the closed hierarchical model and the open market-based model.&lt;ref name="Sawhney and Prandelli (2000)"/&gt;

== Communities of Innovation compared to Communities of Practice ==
These are Communities that take total financial, administrative and operational control over the development of their communities. Democratically elected and answerable to the whole community. It is simply an extension of the community saving societies that have  existed for centuries. The prime objective is sustainable environmental and social development controlled by the skills and finance available. It provides employment, improves the future prospects for all participants and their children, and injects a sense of pride and achievement. Using locally available materials linked to new environmentally friendly cost effective construction materials will produce affordable housing, schools and roads.

== Examples of Communities of Innovation ==

=== The COI that developed Linux ===
Traditionally, the company is the most efficient mean of managing knowledge belonging to different people. The primary [[motivation]] is job security, career advancement and recognition. Lee and Cole (2003) argue for a [[community structure]] for knowledge creation that crosses firms’ boundaries.&lt;ref name="Lee and Cole (2003)"&gt;Lee, G. K. and R. E. Cole. 2003. From a firm-based to a community-based model of knowledge creation: The case of the Linux Kernel development. Organization Science 14 (6) 633-649.&lt;/ref&gt; To substantiate their argument they put forth the case of how “thousands of talented volunteers, dispersed across organizational and geographical boundaries, collaborate via the [[Internet]] to produce a knowledge-intensive, [[innovative]] product of high [[Quality (business)|quality]],” the [[Linux]] kernel (Lee and Cole 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;633). The Linux community has proved to be a very efficient mean of managing knowledge belonging to different people. The primary [[motivation]] is value system, recognition and potential career advancement or hop. Lee and Cole (2003) argue that research on [[knowledge management]] has to date focused on [[hierarchy]] and therefore has not adequately addressed the mobilization of [[distributed knowledge]], knowledge that is dispersed among many people. They note that, as illustrated by the [[Linux]] case, “the advent of the Internet and [[Web-based technologies]] has enabled specialized communities to convene, interact, and share [[resources]] extensively via electronic interfaces,” even across firms’ boundaries (Lee and Cole 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;633). People are able to contribute effectively outside their working hours. [[wikt:coordination|coordination]] of the work (including [[feedback]]) is possible even when people are working from different locations. The [[Catchment area (human geography)|catchment area]] is therefore much larger and the [[critical mass]] of software engineers required to develop and maintain the Linux project was therefore achievable.

== Benefits of Community of Innovation ==

=== Organizational Ambidexterity ===

Successful COIs increase innovations within an organization. They therefore have the potential to contribute to [[organizational ambidexterity]], which refers to the organization’s dual capabilities of managing current business and being flexible and adaptable to meet future changes and demands.&lt;ref name="Raisch &amp; Birkinshaw (2008)"&gt;Raisch, S. and J. Birkinshaw. 2008. Organizational ambidexterity: Antecedents, outcomes, and moderators. Journal of Management 34 (3) 375-409&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=April 2014}}

A '''corporate promoter''' is a firm or person who does the preliminary work incidental to the formation of a company, including its [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]], [[Incorporation (business)|incorporation]], and [[Initial public offering|flotation]], and solicits people to invest money in the company, usually when it is being formed. An [[investment banker]], an [[underwriter]], or a [[stock promoter]] may, wholly or in part, perform the role of a promoter. Promoters generally owe a duty of utmost good faith, so as to not mislead any potential investors, and disclose all material facts about the company's business.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Erlanger v New Sombrero Phosphate Co]]'' (1878) 3 App Cas 1218&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiduciary duties==
Generally, promoters are in a [[fiduciary relationship]] with the company and its [[investor]]s and  [[shareholder]]s, and must avoid [[conflicts of interest]]s and exercise reasonable care in performing their duties. They must refrain from self-dealing or other types of abuse to take advantage of their position as a promoter.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Self-dealing occurs, for example, when a promoter unfairly profits from the conduct of business with the company by charging higher prices for the goods they sell to the company than it would otherwise pay.

A promoter can be a shareholder in the promoted company. If the promoter is the only shareholder, the company may, in compliance with the rule of the [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) and similar rules in other jurisdictions, need to disclose the information prior to selling shares to the public.

The fiduciary duties of promoters include:

* not to make any secret profit out of the promotion of the company. Secret profit is made by entering into a transaction on their own behalf and then selling the concerned property to the company at a profit, without disclosing the profit to the company or its members. Pomoters can make profits in dealings with the company, provided they discloses these profits to the company and its members.
* to make full disclosure to the company of all relevant facts, including any profit made by them in transactions with the company.

If a promoter fails to disclose the profits, made by him in the course of promotion or he knowingly makes a false statement in the prospectus, whereby the person relying on that statement, makes a loss, he will be liable to make good the loss, suffered by that other person. The promoter is liable for untrue statements, made in the prospectus.

A person, who subscribes for any shares or debenture in a company on the faith of the untrue statement contained in the prospectus, can sue the promoter for the loss or damages, sustained by the subscriber as the result of such untrue statement.

==Types of promoters==
Promoters may be classified into the following types.

===Professional promoters===
There are firms which specialise in company promotion, including its incorporation and flotation, before handing it over to the shareholders or their representatives for the company.

===Occasional promoters===
These promoters take interest in floating some companies. They are not engaged in promotion work on a regular basis. They take up the promotion of some company and once it is over they go to their original profession.For instance, engineers, lawyers etc. may float some companies.

===Entrepreneur promoters===
They are both promoters and entrepreneurs. They conceive the idea of a new business unit, do the groundwork to establish it and may subsequently become a part of the management.

===Financial promoters===
Some financial institutions, like investment banks or industrial banks, may take up the promotion of a company with a view to finding opportunities for investment.

==Functions of promoters==
The functions of a promoter may include:

===Discovery of a business idea===
The first stage in company promotion is the generation of new ideas. It is the promoter who conceives the idea of setting up a business, and makes an assessment of the viability of a particular aspects business be it technical feasibility ,financial feasibility ,economic feasibility and also incorporation of company .

===Detailed investigation===
Promoters undertakes a detailed investigation of the viability, profitability and future prospects of the growth of the proposed activity, and may seek the help of specialists such as lawyers, accountants, cost accountants, a company secretary, and engineers. Organisations engaged in market research and other specialised agencies. Specialists are in a position to make an objective analysis of their own areas which may help the promoters. Decisions have to be taken regarding the size, location, layout, manpower etc.

===Assembling the factors of production===
If the proposed endeavour gives promise of success and the promoter is willing to undertake the risk of forming the business, step must be taken to assemble various factors of production, such as land, labour, capital and managerial personnel. Assembly of resources involves making contracts for the purchase of these resources.promoters organise the resources to convert the idea into a reality by forming a company.

===Entering into preliminary contracts===

'''Data Discovery and Query Builder''' (DDQB) is a data abstraction technology, developed by [[IBM]], that allows users to retrieve information from a data warehouse, in terms of the user's specific area of expertise instead of SQL.

DDQB serves the user through a web based graphical user interface and configurable data abstraction model (DAM), which contains both an understanding of the user knowledge domain and the database below it.

DDQB uses a set of [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]]-based customization tooling and can be deployed as a set of [[Web Services]].

'''Direct costs''' are costs which are directly accountable to a [[cost object]] (such as a particular project, facility, function or product). Some overhead costs which can be directly attributed to a project (e.g. a designated project manager) may also be classified as a direct cost.

Direct costs are directly attributable to the object. In construction, the costs of materials, labor, equipment, etc., and all directly involved efforts or expenses for the cost object are direct costs. In manufacturing or other non-construction industries, the portion of operating costs which is directly assignable to a specific product or process is a direct cost.&lt;ref&gt;''Standard AACE International Recommended Practice No. 10S-90 COST ENGINEERING TERMINOLOGY TCM Framework: General Reference,'' Association for the Advancement of Cost Engineering International, 2010, Pg 35&lt;/ref&gt; Direct costs are those for activities or services that benefit specific projects, for example salaries for project staff and materials required for a particular project. Because these activities are easily traced to projects, their costs are usually charged to projects on an item-by-item basis.

Direct costs typically include:
*Direct materials used in manufacturing
*Direct labour
*Direct expenses, e.g. a [[royalty payment]] to a [[patent holder]] for a specific production process &lt;ref&gt;[[Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply|CIPS]] (2106), ''Procurement and supply workflow'', published by Profex Publishing Ltd., p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Direct store delivery''' (DSD) is a key method of selling and distributing products for a large variety of industries, such as [[food]], [[beverage]], home [[personal care]] products, and [[wholesale]] and distribution, [[oil]] &amp; [[gas]], service industries to name industries beyond consumer products.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmaonline.org/downloads/research-and-reports/DSD_Final_111108.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

DSD is a business process that manufacturers use to both sell and distribute goods directly to [[point of sale]]s (PoS) or point of consumption (PoC) including additional product and market related services such as [[merchandising]], [[information gathering]], or equipment service and bypassing any [[retailer]] or wholesaler logistics. A company that performs DSD does not send goods to any locations using any independent third party actor – neither an independent wholesaler, nor the retailer‘s own warehouses.

DSD is an alternative distribution model to centralized distribution and tends to be used extensively in the food industry for fresh products such as milk and bread where minimizing the number of days in the supply chain is a key concern.  Similarly, DSD is used effectively for full truckload orders where bypassing distribution centers makes economic sense.  DSD is also a favored approach when there is a strong requirement for supplier knowledge or service such as is the case with greeting cards for example.  Having said this, there is pressure building up in the food supply chain to reduce the retailer's reliance on DSD and push more volume through centralized distribution channels.

The [[Standard Interchange Language]] (SIL) acts as an interface standard for transferring data between proprietary store systems like DSD and PoS.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4456">'''Distribution Center Management System''' (DCMS) is a user friendly [[Warehouse Management System]] (WMS), designed to track the activities performed in a Distribution Center (DC)/ [[Warehouse]]. It is created and owned by a private company called Eclipse Systems Pvt Ltd. It automates the entire process flow of receiving, managing and shipping goods to customers from the warehouse. DCMS solutions are designed for both large and small scale businesses. In January 2015, the product went open source. 

DCMS helps warehouses to remove the risk of stock pile-up, stock outs, pending orders and loss of sales due to customer dissatisfaction. It dramatically improves the warehouse productivity and increase inventory accuracy to 99.8%.

It helps strengthening customer relationships, reduce operating expenses and increase warehouse and distribution efficiencies. Due to its modular design, DCMS can be easily customized for various clients as per their requirements. WMS is an intelligent investment that will instantly boost accuracy in the warehouse operations and yields long term financial benefits.

==DCMS modules==
A typical list of modules for DCMS can be as follows:

* receiving
* putaway
* order processing
* replenishment
* pulling
* restocking
* picking
* validation
* sorting
* shipping
&lt;br /&gt;
Features of a DCMS also has the following:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scan-infotech.com/distribution-chain-mobility-software.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

* crate management
* supervisory control
* reports

==Benefits==
An effective DCMS helps to prevent stock outs, stock pile-ups, pending orders and loss of sales due to customer dissatisfaction. It improves the warehouse productivity and increases inventory accuracy too. Some other benefits include reducing operating expenses and improvement in efficiencies.

==Radio Frequency and Paper based Solution==
DCMS works in both Radio Frequency (RF) as well as paper based environment. DCMS is a future ready solution. Warehouses which do not wish to make heavy investments in RF immediately, have the option of choosing paper based environment first, and can later adopt RF technology with minimal time and effort.

==Third Party Integration==
DCMS provides an open interface and can be easily integrated with third party software applications. It reduces unnecessary paper work and office routines. Having DCMS in place means warehouses do not need to depend on someone’s experience any more.

==DCMS Vs Warehouse Module of Enterprise Resource Planning==
Inventory initiative in recent times such as JIT (Just In Time), ECR (Efficient Customer Response) and QR (Quick Response) have turned traditional inventory management users to WMS application users. Not only this, more and more Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) users are replacing their existing warehouse module of ERP with WMS because of its functionality fit, knowledgebase, latest up gradations, integration, adaptation to ever changing customer requirement which the ERP warehouse module cannot provide.

==System Architecture==
DCMS is based on Microsoft Technology with an Oracle as Database. It uses web based three tier architecture that provides a standard suite of warehousing applications. DCMS can also be installed on cloud and used as SAAS. DCMS provides rich source of WEB based reports that can be used by all levels of organizations for making important decisions.

==Future ready solution==
Think of a warehouse problem, DCMS will have comprehensive solution for that. Not only this, it is also ready for all future possibilities for which the warehouse may not be prepared in the current scenario. Eclipse System's rich knowledge base and R&amp;D department keeps the application up to date to provide the latest industry features.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13909">'''Dynamic enterprise modeling''' (DEM) is an [[enterprise modeling]] approach developed by the [[Baan Corporation|Baan]] company, and used for the Baan [[enterprise resource planning]] system which aims "to align and implement it in the organizational architecture of the end-using company".&lt;ref&gt;Hossein Bidgoli (2003). ''Encyclopedia of Information Systems''. page 177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heinz-Dieter Knoll et al. (2003). ''Optimising Business Performance with Standard Software Systems''. p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Koning (2008), Baan introduced dynamic enterprise modelling in 1996 as a "means for implementing the Baan ERP product. The modelling focused on a [[Petri net]]–based technique for [[business process modelling]] to which the Baan application units were to be linked. DEM also contains a [[supply-chain]] diagram tool for the logistic network of the company and of an enterprise [[function model]]ling diagram".&lt;ref&gt;Hendrik Koning (2008). [http://igitur-archive.library.uu.nl/dissertations/2008-0908-200828/koning.pdf Communication of IT-Architecture]. Thesis Dutch Research School for Information and Knowledge Systems. {{ISBN|978-90-5335-163-5}}. p.94.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
To align a specific company with dynamic enterprise modeling, the organizational structure is blueprinted top-down from high-level [[business process]]es to low-level processes. This blueprint is used as a roadmap of the organization, that is compatible with the structural roadmap of the software package. Having both roadmaps, the software package and the organizational structure are alienable. The blueprint of an [[organizational structure]] in dynamic enterprise modeling is called a [[reference model]]. A reference model is the total view of visions, functions, organizational structures and processes, which together can be defined as a representative way of doing business in a certain [[organizational typology]].

The DEM reference model consists of a set of underlying models that depict the organizational architecture in a top-down direction. The underlying models are:

* ''Enterprise structure diagrams'': The company site structure is visualized with the dispersed geographic locations, the headquarters, manufacturing plants, warehouses, and supplier and customer locations. Physical as well as logical multi-site organizations for internal logistic or financial flow optimization can be diagrammed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sjaak Brinkkemper]] (2001). [http://www.caise01.ethz.ch/tutorials/brinkkemper.html Business Modelling for the Development and Implementation of Enterprise Applications] (Abstract). Accessed Aug 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Business control model'' : The business control model represents the primary processes of the organization and their control, grouped in business functions. The DEM reference model exists of one main Business Control Model, resulting in several other Business Control Models per function area of the organization.
* ''Business function model'' : The business function model is a [[function model]] that focuses on the targets of the several functions within the company.
* ''Business process model'' : The business process model focuses on the execution of the functions and processes that originate from the business control model and the business function model. Processes flows are depicted and processes are detailed out.
* ''Business organization model'' : The business organization model focuses less on the processes and more on the organizational aspects such as roles and responsibilities.

Together these models are capable of depicting the total organizational structure and aspects that are necessary during the implementation of the dynamic enterprise modeling. The models can have differentiations, which are based on the typology of the organization (i.e.: engineer-to-order organizations require different model structures than assemble-to-order organizations. To elaborate on the way that the reference model is used to implement software and to keep track of the scope of implementation methods, the business control model and the business process model will be explained in detail.

== Dynamic enterprise modeling topics ==

=== Business control model ===
The business control model exists of the business functions of the organization and their internal and external links. Basic features in the model are:

* ''Request-feedback-loop'': A link from, to, or between business functions is called a request-feedback-loop, which consists of 4 states that complete the process and information flows between both business functions. The states are labeled: requested, committed, completed and accepted.
* ''Workflow case''. A workflow case is the description of the execution and the target of the process that occurs between two business functions. The most important critical factors of the workflow case are quantity, quality and time. The 4 states of Request-feedback-loop the together represent the workflow case.
* ''Triggers'': Business functions are aggregates of business processes and focus mainly on the triggers (control) between processes, thus not on the information flows.
* ''Business functions'' : In an optimal situation for the modeling process, a company has only one business function. Business functions are however subdivided when:
** The nature and characteristics of workflow cases fluctuate
** The frequency in underlying processes fluctuate
** Detail-level fluctuates
** More than 1 type of request triggers a function

Next to interaction between two business functions, interaction can also exist between objects that are not in the scope of the reference model. These objects can be external business functions and agents.

* ''External business function'' : this is a group of processes that are part of the organization (meaning that the organization can control the functions), but that is outside of the scope of the reference model.
Agents on the other hand are entities similar to business functions with the exception that they are external of the business (i.e.: customers and suppliers).
* Processes within or between business functions are executed by '''triggers''', which can be '''event-driven''' or '''time-driven'''.
* Exceptions in a system are handled, according to the set handling level in the business process configuration, when the success path of the model is not met in practice.
Subroutines of processes can be modeled in the Business Control Model to take care of possible exceptions that can occur during the execution of a process (i.e.: delay handling in the delivery of goods).

In addition to business functions that consist of the main processes of the organization,  management functions exist.
* ''Management business functions'': These are functions that manage the business process itself and that thus support the execution and triggering of the main business functions.

Having this reference, the main processes of the organization can be captured in the Business Control Model. The main functions of the organization are grouped in the business functions, which consist of the processes that are part of the specific business function. Interactions between the business functions are then depicted using the request-feedback loops.

=== Constructing the business control model ===
A business control model is constructed according to a set path.
* First, the '''scope''' of the business is defined. The scope includes scoping what to model and includes the definition of the agents and external business functions that relate to the business.
* Next, the scope is depicted to a model of the black box with al the agents and external business functions surrounding the black box.
* The next step is to define the process and information flows (request-feedback flows) between the agents and external business functions to and from the black box of the business control model. Defining the request-feedback flows enables the modeler to define what processes are inside the black box.

After creating the main business functions within the business control model, the several business functions are detailed out.
* In case of a production business it is vital to define the '''customer order decoupling point''', referring to the split in the physical process where processes are based on the customer order instead of forecasts.
* Service based businesses on the other hand do not have a physical goods flow and thus do not require a physical process model. It is however imaginable that the same type of process flow can be utilized to construct a business control model for a service based business, as a service can be interpreted as a product as well. In this way, a business control model can be constructed similarly for a service based business as for a physical goods production business, having intangible goods instead of tangible.
* Next to the low-level physical production process, the high-level business functions need to be defined as well. In most cases the higher level business functions relate to planning functions and other tactical and strategical business functions, followed by functions as sales and purchase.

After high-level detail definitions, the business functions are decomposed to lower-level detail definitions to make the business control model alienable to the lower models within the reference model, for this practice, mainly the Business Process Model. In the Business Process Model the processes are elaborated until the lowest level of detail. Given this level of detail, the Baan software functionality is then projected on the processes, depicted in the Business Process Model.

=== Business process model ===
The modeling of processes in DEM, modeling the business process model is done using ''[[Petri net]] building blocks''. DEM uses 4 construction elements:

* State : A state element represents the state of a job token and is followed by the activity that executes the job token of the state.
* Processing activity : A processing activity is the activity that processes the job token of a state, transforming the state of the job token to another state.
* Control activity: A control activity navigates the process activity but does not execute it.
* Subprocess : A subprocess is a collection of different other processes, aggregated in a single element by means of [[complexity management]].

These 4 construction elements enables the modeling of DEM models. The modeling is due to a set collection of modeling constraints, guiding the modeling process in order to have similarly created models by different modelers. Control activities exist in different structures in order to set different possible routes for process flows. The used structures for control activities are:

* OR-split / XOR-split : This structure creates 2 new states out of 1 state, signaling the creation of 2 job tokens out of 1 job token. If the new state can be both of the output tokens, the split is OR, if not, the split is an exclusive OR split (XOR).
* AND-join construction : 2 job tokens are both needed to enable the control activity, creating 1 new job token (thus 1 new state).
* OR-join / XOR-join : 2 job tokens are needed to enable the control activity, creating 1 new job token.
OR means one of the two starting job tokens can be used or both, XOR means only one of the tokens can be used to create the output job token.

=== An example ===
The example below demonstrates the modeling of the concept of marriage and divorce using Petri net building blocks. &lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:DEM-Marriage.gif|300px]] --&gt;
* The Petri net built model expresses the transformation from a single man and woman to a married couple through marriage and back to single individuals through divorce.
* The model starts with the two states called man and woman.
* Through an AND-join construction (both man and woman are needed in order to form a couple) the two states are joined within the control activity called coupling to the new state called couple.
* The couple state then is transformed through the processing activity called marriage, resulting in the transformed state of married couple.
* The state married couple is then transformed to the state divorced couple using the process activity called divorce, resulting in the state called divorced couple.
* The control activity called decoupling finally splits the divorced couple state into the states of man and woman.

=== Assessments ===
Using an embedded method brings the power that the method is designed to implement the software product that the method comes with. This suggests a less complicated usage of the method and more support possibilities.
The negative aspect of an embedded method obviously is that it can only be used for specific product software. Engineers and consultants, operating with several software products, could have more use of a general method, to have just one way of working.

'''Enrolled agent''' (or '''EA''') is a [[tax advisor]] who is a federally authorized tax practitioner empowered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Enrolled agents represent taxpayers before the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) for tax issues including audits, collections and appeals.

Enrolled agent status is the highest credential awarded by the IRS.&lt;ref&gt;Enrolled Agent Information, Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, at [https://www.irs.gov/Tax-Professionals/Enrolled-Agents/Enrolled-Agent-Information].&lt;/ref&gt; The EA credential is recognized across all 50 [[U.S. states]]. [[Attorneys in the United States|Attorneys]] and [[Certified Public Accountant|certified public accountants]] (CPAs) are licensed on a state by state basis, and are also empowered by the Department of the Treasury to represent taxpayers before the IRS.&lt;ref&gt;National Association of Enrolled Agents, "What Is An Enrolled Agent?"&lt;/ref&gt; According to the National Association of Enrolled Agents, there are approximately 53,000 practicing EAs in the United States.

==History==
The position of enrolled agent was created as a reaction to fraudulent war loss claims in the wake of the [[American Civil War]] with roots tracing back to the General Deficiency Act of July 7, 1884,&lt;ref&gt;In section 3 of the General Deficiency Act of July 7, 1884, under the heading “War Department,” Congress authorized appropriation of $125,787.03 for “horses and other property lost in the military service prior to July 1, 1881."&lt;/ref&gt; or General Deficiency Appropriation Bill (H.R. 2735), also known as the "Horse Act of 1884", which was signed into law by President [[Chester A. Arthur]] on July 7, 1884. After the Civil War, many citizens faced difficulties in settling claims with the government for property confiscated for use in the war effort. As a result, Congress endowed enrolled agents with the power of advocacy to prepare claims against the government. From 1884 through the early 20th century, this statute remained largely unchanged.

When the [[Revenue Act of 1913]] was passed, signed into law by President [[Woodrow Wilson]] on October 3, 1913, the scope of the enrolled agent was expanded to include claims for monetary relief for citizens whose taxes had become inequitable.  As [[Income tax in the United States|income]], [[Estate tax in the United States|estate]], [[Gift tax in the United States|gift]] and other sources of tax collections became more complex, the role of the enrolled agent increased to include the preparation of the many tax forms that were required. As a result of this complexity, audits became more prevalent and the enrolled agent role evolved into taxpayer representation, promulgating a series of statutes which were combined into a single Treasury Department Circular in February 19, 1921, known as [[Circular 230]], to address "the laws and regulations governing the recognition of agents, attorneys, and other persons representing claimants before the Treasury Department and offices thereof."

==Becoming an enrolled agent==
To become an enrolled agent, an applicant must obtain a [[Preparer Tax Identification Number|PTIN]] and achieve passing scores on all three parts of the [[Special Enrollment Examination]], which covers many aspects of the [[Internal Revenue Code]], or must have worked at the IRS for five consecutive years in a position which regularly engaged in applying and interpreting the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations relating to income, estate, gift, employment, or excise taxes. A [[background check]], including a review of the applicant’s personal and business tax compliance,&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Michael R., Deputy Inspector General for Audit, Office of Professional Responsibility, Memorandum 2006-10-170. [http://www.treasury.gov/tigta/auditreports/2006reports/200610170fr.html www.treasury.gov/tigta/auditreports/2006reports/200610170fr.html].&lt;/ref&gt; is conducted after an applicant files Form 23, ''Application for Enrollment to Practice Before the Internal Revenue Service'', within one year of completing all three parts of the examination.

==Maintaining enrolled agent status==

===Renewal for active enrolled agents===
To qualify for renewal as an enrolled agent, an individual must complete 72 hours of continuing professional education (CPE) every three years, including two hours of ethics or professional conduct in each of the three years.&lt;ref name="seq"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sequoiacpe.com/ea-cpe-requirements|title=Enrolled Agent CPE Requirements|publisher=SequoiaCPE|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent overloading of CPEs in any year of an enrollment cycle, the IRS requires a minimum of 16 hours of CPE every year.&lt;ref name="CPE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mypescpe.com/CPE-Self-Study-CPE-for-Accounting-Audit-Ethics-Tax-CFPs-Etc.cmc?&amp;view=4E|title=EA CPE Requirements|publisher=www.mypescpe.com|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Individuals must renew their PTIN between October 16 and December 31 of each year.

Individuals must file Form 8554, ''Application for Renewal of Enrollment to Practice Before the Internal Revenue Service'', within the applicable renewal period.

Renewal periods are based on the last digit of an enrolled agent's [[Social Security number]] (SSN)&lt;ref name="CPE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="seq"/&gt; or [[Tax Identification Number|tax identification number]]:

===Renewal after initial enrollment cycle===
Individuals admitted to practice at any time during an enrollment cycle, "the three successive enrollment years preceding the effective date of renewal,"&lt;ref&gt;TreasuryDepartment Circular No. 230 § 10.6(e)(1)(ii)&lt;/ref&gt; must complete two hours of continuing professional education for each month of enrollment, including two hours of ethics or professional conduct in each year. If an individual receives initial enrollment between November 1 and April 1 of their applicable renewal period, they will not be required to renew until the expiration of the first full three-year enrollment cycle following their initial enrollment.

===Failure to renew===
An individual who has not filed a timely application for renewal, who has not made a timely response to the notice of noncompliance, or who has not satisfied the requirements of eligibility for renewal, will be placed on a roster of inactive enrolled individuals. During this time, the individual will be ineligible to practice before the Internal Revenue Service and may not state or imply that they are eligible to represent taxpayers, use the term enrolled agent, or use the EA designation.

==Practice before the IRS: Enrolled agents and other practitioners==
The right to practice before the Internal Revenue Service is regulated by Federal statute,&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|31|330}} and {{usc|5|500}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and persons authorized to practice are known as "Federally Authorized Tax Practitioners",&lt;ref&gt;See also {{usc|26|7525(a)(3)(A)}}, relating to confidentiality of communications.&lt;/ref&gt; or "FATPs". The FATP status is granted to attorneys, [[Certified Public Accountants|certified public accountants]], and enrolled agents, each having unlimited representation rights before the Internal Revenue Service. These practitioners may represent their clients on any matters including audits, collection actions, payment issues, tax refund matters, and appeals.&lt;ref&gt;Internal Revenue Service, "[https://www.irs.gov/Tax-Professionals/Understanding-Tax-Return-Preparer-Credentials Understanding Tax Return Preparer Credentials]"&lt;/ref&gt; FATP status is also granted with limited representation rights to [[Enrolled actuary|enrolled actuaries]], enrolled retirement plan agents, and [[Registered Tax Return Preparer|registered tax return preparers]].

Enrolled agents, like other FATPs, are subject to a set of procedures and regulations described in Treasury Department Circular No. 230,'' Regulations Governing the Practice of Attorneys, Certified Public Accountants, Enrolled Agents, Enrolled Actuaries, and Appraisers before the Internal Revenue Service''.&lt;ref&gt;Codified in regulations at 31 C.F.R. subtitle A, part 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

When practicing before the Internal Revenue Service, enrolled agents may not use the term "certified" in describing their professional designation. An enrolled agent admitted to practice before the Internal Revenue Service may not state or imply that an employer/employee relationship exists between the enrolled agent and the Internal Revenue Service.

==Practice in federal courts==
Enrolled agent status does not authorize the enrollee to practice before the [[United States Tax Court]] or in any other court.

Practice in U.S. Tax Court is limited to members of the Bar of the Court. The Internal Revenue Code states, "No qualified person shall be denied admission to practice before the Tax Court because of his failure to be a member of any profession or calling."&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|26|7452}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-attorneys must pass a Tax Court exam for admission to the Bar of the Court. Attorneys are admitted to the Bar of the Tax Court without having to take the Tax Court examination.&lt;ref&gt;See generally Rule 200, Rules of Practice and Procedure, United States Tax Court (eff. July 6, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Practice in other federal courts is generally limited to persons licensed as attorneys.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Rule 5, Rules of the Supreme Court of the United States, effective July 1, 2013; Rule 46, Rules and Internal Operating Procedures of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (May 2016); Attorney Admissions Requirements, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas (July 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ethical issues of [[business communication]]''' is the process by which individuals exchange information between other individuals or groups of people. Throughout the process, effective communicators try as clearly and accurately to convey their thoughts, intentions and, objectives to their receiver. Communication is successful only when both the sender and the receiver understand the same information. In today's business environments, effective communication skills are necessary due to the highly informational and technological era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.essentiallifeskills.net/goodcommunicationskills.html|title=Good Communication Skills - Key to Any Success|last=Hereford|first=Z|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of context, communication involves choice, reflects values, and has consequences. For better communication, understanding the obvious and the subtle issues relating to communication is necessary. Any company that aims to be socially and ethically responsible must make a priority of [[Communication ethics|ethical communication]] both inside the company and in its interactions with the public. In theory, many [[Consumer|consumers]] prefer to do business with [[Business|companies]] they believe are ethical which gives those ethical businesses an advantage in the market.

== Overview ==
Some of the vital characteristics of ethical communication are discussed below.

*'''Conveying the point without offending the audience''':&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/?term=communication|title=Online etymology Dictionary|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While communicating with the audience, expressing the desired message to them in a significant manner is of primary importance. For instance, the employees in a company can be asked to increase their efficiency in a demanding manner whereas managers and executives will feel offended if the same tone is used on them. There are different ways to explain the exact things to them in a much smoother manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Meenakshi Raman, Prakash|title=Business communication|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=0-19-567695-5|edition=2. impression.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Maintain a relationship with the audience''':
Maintaining the same wavelength with the audience is very important for a communicator to ensure the audiences feel at home. Experienced communicators immediately build a relationship based on trust with the audience as soon as they start speaking. Great orators such as Winston Churchill and Mahatma Gandhi always were able to maintain a relationship with their audience because they were masters at striking the same wavelength of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogin|first=Mary Ellen Guffey, Kathleen Rhodes, Patricia|title=Business communication : process and product|year=2009|publisher=Nelson Education|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-17-650046-7|edition=3rd brief Canadian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Avoid withholding crucial information''':

In the modern era, information is vital for all decisions. Hence, it is essential for any organization to be cautious when communicating with tvitalic. The related information should be absolute, and all crucial information must be conveyed appropriately. Purposely withholding crucial information might result in the public conceiving a bad image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=al.]|first=A. C. "Buddy" Krizan |title=Business communication|year=2006|publisher=Thomson South-Western|location=Mason, OH|isbn=0-324-37485-2|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Well organized value system''':
In order to ensure that this concept is successfully practiced and understood in an organization, a well-organized value system must be established throughout the organization by the top management. If an organization functions on the base of value systems common to both the top management and the employees, mutual respect between them will be present. A sound and healthy value system can make way for ethical communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jethwaney|first=Jaishri|title=Corporate communication : principles and practice.|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-806365-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Accuracy of information is necessary''':

Any information that is to be passed on must be true and accurate. Communicating without checking the truth of the information can be highly dangerous for the organization. Identification of the source and testing the information is necessary before communicating it.

== Summary ==
The work of an organizational communication professional consists in developing communication plans that seek to restore trust, not only in the organization but the leaders and in all the people who work for it, in verbally promoting ethical behaviors and generating spaces of communication that help support institutional values.

In this way, both managers and employees will be "on the same page," employees will feel heard and respected and will treat customers in the same way. Also, this will generate more loyalty on the part of the client and, therefore, more business. In addition, a business that communicates internally with ethics will most likely project that image in the business community, will seek to maintain good relations with the government and its most successful businesses.  Without the distractions and negative effects that can have the legal implications of running a business " ethically debatable," the organization will be able to concentrate its efforts on its employees, its products, and its clients.

A '''foreign direct investment''' ('''FDI''') is an [[investment]] in the form of a [[Controlling interest|controlling ownership]] in a [[business]] in one country by an entity based in another country.&lt;ref name=FTLexicon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=foreign-direct-investment|title=Foreign Direct Investment Definition from Financial Times Lexicon|author=|date=|website=lexicon.ft.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus distinguished from a [[foreign portfolio investment]] by a notion of direct control.

The origin of the investment does not impact the definition, as an FDI: the investment may be made either "inorganically" by buying a company in the target country or "organically" by expanding the operations of an existing business in that country.

==Definition==
Broadly, foreign direct investment includes "mergers and acquisitions, building new facilities, reinvesting profits earned from overseas operations, and intra company loans". In a narrow sense, foreign direct investment refers just to building new facility, and a lasting management interest (10 percent or more of voting stock) in an enterprise operating in an economy other than that of the investor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/BX.KLT.DINV.CD.WD |title=Foreign direct investment, net inflows (BoP, current US$) &amp;#124; Data &amp;#124; Table |publisher=Data.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; FDI is the sum of [[equity capital]], long-term capital, and short-term capital as shown in the [[balance of payments]]. FDI usually involves participation in management, [[joint-venture]], [[transfer of technology]] and expertise. ''Stock'' of FDI is the ''net'' (i.e., outward FDI minus inward FDI) cumulative FDI for any given period. Direct investment excludes [[Foreign portfolio investment|investment through purchase of shares]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/docs/notesanddefs.html?countryName=Iran&amp;countryCode=ir&amp;regionCode=me#2198 |title=CIA - The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FDI, a subset of [[international factor movements]], is characterized by controlling ownership of a business enterprise in one country by an entity based in another country. Foreign direct investment is distinguished from foreign portfolio investment, a passive investment in the securities of another country such as public [[stock]]s and [[bond (finance)|bonds]], by the element of "control".&lt;ref name="FTLexicon"/&gt; According to the ''[[Financial Times]]'', "Standard definitions of control use the internationally agreed 10 percent threshold of voting shares, but this is a grey area as often a smaller block of shares will give control in widely held companies. Moreover, control of technology, management, even crucial inputs can confer de facto control."&lt;ref name=FTLexicon/&gt;

==Theoretical background==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2016}}
According to Grazia Ietto-Gillies (2012),&lt;ref&gt;Ietto-Gillies, Grazia (2012) Transnational corporations and international production: Concepts, Theories and Effects. Second Edition. Edward Elgar: Cheltenham, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; prior to [[Stephen Hymer]]’s theory regarding direct investment in the 1960s, the reasons behind Foreign Direct Investment and Multinational Corporations were explained by [[neoclassical economics]] based on macro economic principles. These theories were based on the classical theory of trade in which the motive behind trade was a result of the difference in the costs of production of goods between two countries, focusing on the low cost of production as a motive for a firm’s foreign activity. For example, [[Joe S. Bain]] only explained the internationalization challenge through three main principles: absolute cost advantages, [[product differentiation]] advantages and [[economies of scale]]. Furthermore, the neoclassical theories were created under the assumption of the existence of perfect competition. Intrigued by the motivations behind large foreign investments made by corporations from the United States of America, Hymer developed a framework that went beyond the existing theories, explaining why this phenomenon occurred, since he considered that the previously mentioned theories could not explain foreign investment and its motivations.

Facing the challenges of his predecessors, Hymer focused his theory on filling the gaps regarding international investment. The theory proposed by the author approaches international investment from a different and more firm-specific point of view. As opposed to traditional macroeconomics-based theories of investment, Hymer states that there is a difference between mere capital investment, otherwise known as portfolio investment, and direct investment. The difference between the two, which will become the cornerstone of his whole theoretical framework, is the issue of control, meaning that with direct investment firms are able to obtain a greater level of control than with portfolio investment. Furthermore, Hymer proceeds to criticize the neoclassical theories, stating that the theory of capital movements cannot explain international production. Moreover, he clarifies that FDI is not necessarily a movement of funds from a home country to a host country, and that it is concentrated on particular industries within many countries. In contrast, if interest rates were the main motive for international investment, FDI would include many industries within fewer countries.

Another observation made by Hymer went against what was maintained by the neoclassical theories: foreign direct investment is not limited to investment of excess profits abroad. In fact, foreign direct investment can be financed through loans obtained in the host country, payments in exchange for equity (patents, technology, machinery etc.), and other methods.
The main determinants of FDI is side as well as growth prospectus of the economy of the country when FDI is made. Hymer proposed some more determinants of FDI due to criticisms, along with assuming market and imperfections.  These are as follows:
#'''Firm-specific advantages''': Once domestic investment was exhausted, a firm could exploit its advantages linked to market imperfections, which could provide the firm with market power and competitive advantage. Further studies attempted to explain how firms could monetize these advantages in the form of licenses.
#'''Removal of conflicts''': conflict arises if a firm is already operating in foreign market or looking to expand its operations within the same market. He proposes that the solution for this hurdle arose in the form of collusion, sharing the market with rivals or attempting to acquire a direct control of production. However, it must be taken into account that a reduction in conflict through acquisition of control of operations will increase the market imperfections.
#'''Propensity to formulate an internationalization strategy to mitigate risk''': According to his position, firms are characterized with 3 levels of decision making: the day to day supervision, management decision coordination and long term strategy planning and decision making. The extent to which a company can mitigate risk depends on how well a firm can formulate an internationalization strategy taking these levels of decision into account.

Hymer's importance in the field of [[International Business]] and Foreign Direct Investment stems from him being the first to theorize about the existence of Multinational Enterprises (MNE) and the reasons behind Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) beyond macroeconomic principles, his influence on later scholars and theories in International Business, such as the OLI (Ownership, Location and Internationalization) theory by [[John Harry Dunning|John Dunning]] and Christos Pitelis which focuses more on transaction costs. Moreover, “the efficiency-value creation component of FDI and MNE activity was further strengthened by two other major scholarly developments in the 1990s: the resource-based (RBV) and evolutionary theories" ([http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v39/n1/full/8400328a.html Dunning &amp; Pitelis, 2008])
&lt;ref&gt;Dunning, John &amp; Pitelis, C.N. (2008). Stephen Hymer’s contribution to international business scholarship: and assessment and extension. Journal of International Business Studies, 39 (1), pp. 167-173&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some of his predictions later materialized, for example the power of supranational bodies such as IMF or the World Bank that increases inequalities (Dunning &amp; Piletis, 2008).

Types of FDI
# '''Horizontal FDI''' arises when a firm duplicates its home country-based activities at the same value chain stage in a host country through FDI.&lt;ref name="guidewhois1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guidewhois.com/2011/01/what-is-foreign-direct-investment-horizontal-and-vertical/ |title=What is Foreign Direct Investment, Horizontal and Vertical « Knowledge Base |work=Guidewhois.com |date= |accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Platform FDI''' Foreign direct investment from a source country into a destination country for the purpose of exporting to a third country.
# '''Vertical FDI''' takes place when a firm through FDI moves upstream or downstream in different value chains i.e., when firms perform value-adding activities stage by stage in a vertical fashion in a host country.&lt;ref name="guidewhois1"/&gt;

==Methods==
The foreign direct investor may acquire voting power of an enterprise in an economy through any of the following methods:
* by incorporating a wholly owned subsidiary or company anywhere
* by acquiring shares   in an associated enterprise
* through a merger or an acquisition of an unrelated enterprise
* participating in an equity [[international joint venture|joint venture]] with another investor or enterprise&lt;ref&gt;Slaughter and May (2012). "Legal regimes governing Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in host countries". {{cite web |url=http://a4id.org/sites/default/files/user/documents/FDI%20Legal%20Guide.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053421/http://a4id.org/sites/default/files/user/documents/FDI%20Legal%20Guide.pdf |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }} . Advocates for International Development. Retrieved 19 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forms of FDI incentives===
Foreign direct investment incentives may take the following forms:&lt;ref&gt;U.S. States regularly offer tax incentives to inbound investors.  See, for example, an excellent summary, written by Sidney Silhan, of state tax incentives offered to FDI businesses at: BNA Portfolio 6580, U.S. Inbound Business Tax Planning, at A-71.&lt;/ref&gt;
'''
* low [[corporate tax]] and individual [[income tax]] rates
* [[tax holiday]]s
* other types of tax concessions
* preferential [[tariffs]]
* [[special economic zone]]s
* [[Free trade zone|EPZ]] – Export Processing Zones
* [[Bonded warehouse]]s
* [[Maquiladora]]s
* investment financial subsidies&lt;ref&gt;≥&lt;/ref&gt;
* free land or land subsidies
* relocation &amp; expatriation
* infrastructure subsidies
* R&amp;D support
* Energy
* derogation from regulations (usually for very large projects)'''
Governmental Investment Promotion Agencies (IPAs) use various marketing strategies inspired by the private sector to try and attract inward FDI, including [[diaspora]] marketing.
* by excluding the internal investment to get a profited downstream.

==Importance and barriers to FDI==
The rapid growth of world population since 1950 has occurred mostly in developing countries.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} This growth has been matched by more rapid increases in gross domestic product, and thus income per capita has increased in most countries around the world since 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pophealthmetrics.com/content/10/1/12.|title=Developing a comprehensive time series of GDP per capita for 210 countries from 1950 to 2015|first1=Spencer L|last1=James|first2=Paul|last2=Gubbins|first3=Christopher JL|last3=Murray|first4=Emmanuela|last4=Gakidou|date=30 July 2012|journal=Population Health Metrics|volume=10|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1478-7954-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An increase in FDI may be associated with improved economic growth due to the influx of capital and increased tax revenues for the host country. Host countries often try to channel FDI investment into new infrastructure and other projects to boost development. Greater competition from new companies can lead to productivity gains and greater efficiency in the host country and it has been suggested that the application of a foreign entity’s policies to a domestic subsidiary may improve corporate governance standards. Furthermore, foreign investment can result in the transfer of soft skills through training and job creation, the availability of more advanced technology for the domestic market and access to research and development resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=UNCTAD|url=http://unctad.org/en/Docs/ciiem2d2_en.pdf |title=Foreign direct investment, the transfer and diffusion of technology, and sustainable development (2010) |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The local population may benefit from the employment opportunities created by new businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Slaughter And May |url=http://a4id.org/sites/default/files/user/documents/FDI%20Legal%20Guide.pdf |title=Legal Regimes Governing Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) In Host Countries |publisher=Advocates for International Development |year=2012 |accessdate=21 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053421/http://a4id.org/sites/default/files/user/documents/FDI%20Legal%20Guide.pdf |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In many instances, the investing company is simply transferring its older production capacity and machines, which might still be appealing to the host country because of technological lags or under-development, in order to avoid competition against its own products by the host country/company.

===Developing world===
A 2010 [[meta-analysis]] of the effects of foreign direct investment (FDI) on local firms in developing and transition countries suggests that foreign investment robustly increases local productivity growth.

The [[Commitment to Development Index]] ranks the "development-friendliness" of rich country investment policies.

===China===
FDI in China, also known as RFDI (renminbi foreign direct investment), has increased considerably in the last decade, reaching $19.1 billion in the first six months of 2012, making China the largest recipient of foreign direct investment and topping the United States which had $17.4 billion of FDI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/24/us-china-us-investment-idUSBRE89N0EZ20121024|title= China tops U.S. as investment target in 1st half 2012: U.N. agency|date=24 October 2012|accessdate= 24 October 2012|work= [[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the FDI flow into China was $24.1 billion, resulting in a 34.7% market share of FDI into the Asia-Pacific region. By contrast, FDI out of China in 2013 was $8.97 billion, 10.7% of the Asia-Pacific share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.fdiintelligence.com/Landing-Pages/fDi-report-2014/fDi-Report-2014-Asia-Pacific#Main|title= The fDi Report 2014 - Asia Pacific|date=25 June 2014|accessdate= 17 July 2014|work= [[fDi Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|global financial crisis]] FDI fell by over one-third in 2009 but rebounded in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FDI by Country|url=http://greyhill.com/fdi-by-country/ |publisher=Greyhill Advisors|accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FDI into the Chinese mainland maintained steady growth in 2015 despite the economic slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy. FDI, which excludes investment in the financial sector, rose 6.4 percent year on year to $126.27 billion in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scio.gov.cn/32618/Document/1462528/1462528.htm|title=China FDI inflow rises 6.4% in 2015|author=|date=|website=scio.gov.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first nine months of 2016, China reportedly surpassed the US to become the world’s largest assets acquirer, measured by the value of corporate takeovers. As part of the transition by Chinese investors from an interest in developing economies to high-income economies, Europe has become an important destination for Chinese outward FDI. In 2014 and 2015, the EU was estimated to be the largest market for Chinese acquisitions, in terms of value.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hellström|first=Jerker|year=2016|title=China's Acquisitions in Europe: European Perceptions of Chinese Investments and their Strategic Implications|url=https://www.academia.edu/30801661/Chinas_Acquisitions_in_Europe_European_Perceptions_of_Chinese_Investments_and_their_Strategic_Implications|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=Swedish Defence Research Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rapid increase in Chinese takeovers of European companies has fueled concerns among political observers and policymakers over a wide range of issues. These issues include potential negative strategic implications for individual EU member states and the EU as a whole, links between the Chinese Communist Party and the investing enterprises, and the lack of reciprocity in terms of limited access for European investors to the Chinese market.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [https://www.academia.edu/30801661/Chinas_Acquisitions_in_Europe_European_Perceptions_of_Chinese_Investments_and_their_Strategic_Implications]

Similarly, concerns among low-income households within Australia have prompted several non formal inquiries into direct foreign investment activities from china. As a result numerous Australian political representatives have been investigated, Sam Dastyari&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-12-12/sam-dastyari-resigns-from-parliament/9247390|title=Sam Dastyari resigns|last=|first=|date=|work=ABC|accessdate=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; has resigned as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://merchantchannels.co/doing-business-in-china/|title=Direct Foreign Investment- Doing Business In China|last=Jonathon|first=Devitt|date=10 March 2018|website=Merchantchannels.co|accessdate=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign investment was introduced in 1991 under [[Foreign Exchange Management Act|Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA)]], driven by then finance minister [[Manmohan Singh]]. As Singh subsequently became the prime minister, this has been one of his top political problems, even in the current times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Starting from a baseline of less than $1 billion in 1990, a 2012 [[UNCTAD]] survey projected India as the second most important FDI destination (after China) for transnational corporations during 2010–2012. As per the data, the sectors that attracted higher inflows were services, telecommunication, construction activities and computer software and hardware. Mauritius, Singapore, US and UK were among the leading sources of FDI. Based on UNCTAD data FDI flows were $10.4 billion, a drop of 43% from the first half of the last year.&lt;ref name=edges&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203406404578074683825139320|title=China Edges Out U.S. as Top Foreign-Investment Draw Amid World Decline|work=Wall Street Journal|date=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Broadly speaking, the United States has a fundamentally "[[open economy]]" and low barriers to FDI.&lt;ref name=touts/&gt;

U.S. FDI totaled $194&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.doc.gov/sites/default/.../fdiesaissuebriefno2061411final_0.pdf]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Billion in 2010. 84% of FDI in the United States in 2010 came from or through eight countries: Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Japan, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. FDI and site selection|url=http://www.esa.doc.gov/Reports/foreign-direct-investment-united-states|publisher=Greyhill Advisors|accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major source of investment is real estate; the [[Foreign investment in the United States real estate|foreign investment in this area]] totaled $92.2 billion in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = China buys $22bn worth of US homes, leads global pack | author= | publisher = [[Russia Today]] | date = 9 July 2014| url = http://rt.com/business/171496-china-california-homes-property/ | accessdate = 26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; under various forms of purchase structures (considering the U.S. taxation and residency laws).{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

A 2008 study by the [[Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco]] indicated that foreigners hold greater shares of their investment portfolios in the United States if their own countries have less developed financial markets, an effect whose magnitude decreases with income per capita. Countries with fewer capital controls and greater trade with the United States also invest more in U.S. equity and bond markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/papers/2008/wp08-27bk.pdf |publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco|title=''Why Do Foreigners Invest in the United States?''|date=October 2008|accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[White House]] data reported in 2011 found that a total of 5.7 million workers were employed at facilities highly dependent on foreign direct investors. Thus, about 13% of the American manufacturing workforce depended on such investments. The average pay of said jobs was found as around $70,000 per worker, over 30% higher than the average pay across the entire U.S. workforce.&lt;ref name=touts/&gt;

President [[Barack Obama]] said in 2012, "In a global economy, the United States faces increasing competition for the jobs and industries of the future. Taking steps to ensure that we remain the destination of choice for investors around the world will help us win that competition and bring prosperity to our people."&lt;ref name=touts&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2011/06/white-house-touts-growing-foreign-direct-investment-in-the-us.html|publisher=[[ABC News]]|title=White House Touts Growing Foreign Direct Investment In The U.S. accepted ngp |date=20 June 2011|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, the [[United States House of Representatives]] voted to pass the [[Global Investment in American Jobs Act of 2013 (H.R. 2052; 113th Congress)]], a bill which would direct the [[United States Department of Commerce]] to "conduct a review of the global competitiveness of the United States in attracting foreign direct investment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 2052 - Text|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th/house-bill/2052/text|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=11 September 2013|page=Section 4(a)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Supporters of the bill argued that increased foreign direct investment would help job creation in the United States.&lt;ref name=kasp1&gt;{{cite news|last=Kasperowcz|first=Pete|title=House passes bill aimed at boosting foreign direct investments in the U.S.|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/321187-house-passes-bill-aimed-at-boosting-foreign-direct-investment-in-the-us|accessdate=11 September 2013|newspaper=The Hill|date=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The UK has a very free market economy and is open to foreign investment. Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] has sought investment from emerging markets and from the Far East in particular and some of Britain's largest infrastructure including energy and skyscrapers such as [[The Shard]] have been built with foreign investment.

* History of Foreign Investment Law

In 1991,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;張玹誠(2006)。外國直接投資俄羅斯之研究。國立政治大學俄羅斯研究所碩士論文，未出版，台北。&lt;/ref&gt; for the first time, Russia regulated the form, range and favorable policy of FDI in Russia.

In 1994,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; a consulting council of FDI was an established in Russia, which was responsible for setting tax rate and policies for exchange rate, improving investment environment, mediating relationship between central and local government, researching and improving images of FDI work, and increasing the right and responsibility of Ministry of Economic in appealing FDI and enforcing all kinds of policies.

In 1997,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Russia starts to enact policies appealing for FDI on particular industries, for example, fossil fuel, gas, woods, transportation, food reprocessing, etc.

In 1999,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Russia announced a law named 'FDI of the Russian Federation', which aimed at providing a basic guarantee for foreign investors on investing, running business, earnings.

In 2008,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Russia banned FDI on strategic industries, such as military defense and country safety.

In 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kremlin.ru/news/47173|title=Послание Президента Федеральному Собранию|website=Kremlin.ru|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; president Putin announced that once abroad Russian investment inflows legally, it would not be checked by tax or law sector. This is a favorable policy of Putin to appeal Russian investment to come back.

'''The Fuld-Gilad-Herring Academy of Competitive Intelligence''' is an educational organization  bringing professional training to the field of [[competitive intelligence]] (CI).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scip.org/Publications/CIMagIssueDetail.cfm?ItemNumber=1988 CI Education Issue]&lt;/ref&gt;  Established in 1996, the Academy has expanded its training to thousands of managers from 58 countries and six continents at its campuses in [[Cambridge, MA]] and [[Brussels, Belgium]]. The Academy is the only CI-dedicated institution to be externally accredited by the [[International Association of Continuing Education and Training]] (IACET).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academyci.com The Academy's web site]&lt;/ref&gt; It grants the Competitive Intelligence Professional (CIP) certification based on a 9-course program, including a course in ethics and a pioneering course in business war gaming.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Hall, “Military moves on the corporate battlefield”, The Evening Standard, 8 May 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dale Buss, “Berlitz for the boss”, Chief Executive, 1 December 2001, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; To be certified, managers must complete the required coursework and pass a certification exam. To accommodate managers whose main interest is in using CI tools and managers working as CI professionals, the Academy offers two levels of certification: a basic CIP-I, and an advanced CIP-II. The Academy is currently the largest training institute in its field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academyci.com/About/alumni.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Competitive Intelligence Standards ==

On March, 2011, the board of the professional association in the field of competitive intelligence- '''SCIP''' (Strategic and Competitive Intelligence Professionals) voted to adopt the Academy's CIP program as its official global certification program to help create standards in the field of strategic and competitive intelligence. The certification was renamed SCIP-CIP certificate conferred by ACI.&lt;ref&gt;http://info.intelligencecareers.com/index.php/2011/03/22/2011-06-1324-certification-in-competitive-intelligence-boston-massachusetts/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The history of the Academy tracks closely the history of the field of competitive intelligence which has risen in importance during the 1980s with the increase in global competitive pressures and the spread of [[Internet search engines]] which made information more accessible. In 1986, the [[Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals]] (SCIP) was founded in Washington, DC to serve as the professional association for academics, practitioners and consultants in CI. During the next decade, organizations experimented in acquiring and using CI with little discipline and no consistent results. For example, as a survey by the Academy showed, one of CI's main objectives, avoiding strategic surprises, was not being accomplished in many large companies.&lt;ref&gt;George S. Day and Paul J.H. Schoemaker, “Scanning the Periphery”, ''Harvard Business Review'', November 2005, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Three early developers of the Society banded together to create a standard of training and performance in the field. They were: Leonard Fuld, whose book, ''Competitor Intelligence'', was the first best seller on the subject,&lt;ref&gt;Fuld, Leonard, ''Competitor Intelligence: How to get it, how to use it''. NY: Wiley, 1985.  {{ISBN|978-0471809678}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Gilad|Ben Gilad]], whose book The Business Intelligence System created the benchmark for setting up a corporate CI function,&lt;ref&gt;Gilad, Ben and Tamar Gilad, The Business Intelligence System. NY: American Management Association, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; and Jan Herring who was the founding director of the first competitive intelligence function created in 1982 at [[Motorola]] Corp.&lt;ref&gt;Herring, Jan P. Measuring the Effectiveness of Competitive Intelligence: Assessing &amp; Communicating CI's Value to Your Organization. Virginia: Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the growth of SCIP, the creation of the Academy accelerated greatly the formalization and acceptance of CI functions and positions across global companies, with some estimating that 97% of Fortune 500 corporations today have at least one CI analyst in each of their larger business units.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Boyle, “The Prying Game: A little knowledge is a dangerous...weapon. No wonder competitive intelligence schools are on the rise.” Fortune Magazine, Advisor/Careers, 17 September 2001, Vol. 144, (5), p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition==

As the field continued to evolve, several organizations in recent years have joined the Academy in offering training programs in competitive intelligence, mostly as an extension of other degree programs, among them [[Mercyhurst College Institute for Intelligence Studies]] in PA (an extension of a government intelligence program), [[Simmons College (Massachusetts)|Simmons College]] in MA (part of Library and Information studies), and the [[University of Denver]] in CO (part of a graduate degree in information management). Other programs include the [[Ecole de Guerre Economique]] in France and Institute for Competitive Intelligence in Germany. Entry level courses are also offered by the Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals.

==Student body==

The functional distribution of the Academy's alumni body covers managers and professionals from competitive and market intelligence functions, [[marketing]], [[market research]], [[business development]], [[strategic planning]], research scientists and development engineers. Though the typical trainee is a manager at a Global Fortune 500 company, past participants included some unusual representatives from the [[Catholic Church]], various governments' defense agencies, farmer cooperatives, national economic development boards, and a Cabinet Minister.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6321">'''Galileo''' is a [[computer reservations system]] (CRS) owned by [[Travelport]]. As of 2000 it had a 26.4% share of worldwide CRS airline bookings.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Department of Transportation]]: [http://www.dot.gov/affairs/Computer%20Reservations%20System.htm Computer Reservations System (CRS)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527000044/http://www.dot.gov/affairs/Computer%20Reservations%20System.htm |date=2008-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to airline reservations, the Galileo CRS is also used to book [[train]] travel, [[cruise ship|cruise]]s, [[car]] rental, and [[hotel]] rooms.

The Galileo system was moved from Denver, Colorado, to the [[Worldspan]] datacenter in Atlanta, Georgia, on September 28, 2008, following the 2007 merger of Travelport and Worldspan (although they now share the same datacenter, they continue to be run as separate systems). 

Galileo is subject to the [[Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System II|Capps II]] and its successor [[Secure Flight]] program for the selection of passengers with a risk profile.

Galileo is a member of the [[International Air Transport Association]], of the [[OpenTravel Alliance]] and of [[SITA (IT company)|SITA]].

==History==
Galileo traces its roots back to 1971 when [[United Airlines]] created its first computerized central reservation system under the name Apollo. During the 1980s and early 1990s, a significant proportion of airline tickets were sold by travel agents.  Flights by the airline owning the reservation system had preferential display on the computer screen.  Due to the high market penetration of the Sabre and Apollo systems, owned by American Airlines and United Airlines, respectively, Worldspan and Galileo were created by other airline groups in an attempt to gain market share in the computer reservation system market and, by inference, the commercial airline market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5D81E38F933A25754C0A961948260 | work=The New York Times | title=United Air In Venture In Europe | first=Agis | last=Salpukas | date=July 10, 1987 | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Galileo was formed in 1987 by nine European carriers -- [[British Airways]], [[KLM Royal Dutch Airlines]], [[Alitalia]], [[Swissair]], [[Austrian Airlines]], [[Olympic Airlines|Olympic]], [[Sabena]], [[Air Portugal]] and [[Aer Lingus]].&lt;ref name="baltimoresun1992"&gt;[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-03-04/business/1992064009_1_american-airlines-apollo-carriers Two top airline reservations systems to be merged - Baltimore Sun]. Articles.baltimoresun.com (1992-03-04). Retrieved on 2013-08-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response and to prevent possible government intervention, United Airlines spun off its Apollo reservation system, which was then controlled by Covia.  Galileo International was born when Covia acquired Europe's Galileo and merged it with the Apollo system in 1992.&lt;ref name="baltimoresun1992"/&gt;

The Apollo reservation system was used by United Airlines until March 3, 2012, when it switched to SHARES, a system used by its former Continental Airlines subsidiary. Apollo is still used by Galileo International (now part of [[Travelport]] GDS) travel agency customers in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], and [[Japan]].

Galileo UK{{Clarifyme|What is Galileo UK?|date=October 2013}} was originally created from [[Travicom]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IbTT1yIfsYIC&amp;pg=PA339&amp;lpg=PA339&amp;dq=travicom+galileo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5_wk3mA2Fw&amp;sig=C6mHjBtvkosKXTLk64ZBXTxqPaQ Dictionary of Travel and Tourism&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], Books.Google.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cards.org/ Travicom and Galileo User Group&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GCmHf1FDZlQC&amp;pg=PT128&amp;lpg=PT128&amp;dq=travicom+galileo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6f7wmUFjg2&amp;sig=aQ8rcmVCBBXtSdxznOzMFVmuzvY Leisure Marketing&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], Books.Google.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1987/1987%20-%201976.html Flight Global&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], Flithglobal.com&lt;/ref&gt;  which was the world's first multi-access reservations system using the technology developed by [[Videcom international|Videcom]]. [[Travicom]] was a company launched by [[Videcom international|Videcom]], [[British Airways]], [[British Caledonian]] and CCL in 1976 which in 1988 became Galileo UK.

===Developments===
*[[Travel Agent]]s now{{When|date=February 2011}} also book [[Amtrak|Amtrak Rail]] on the system and issue the tickets directly.
*[[Southwest Airlines]] has entered into a marketing agreement with Apollo/Galileo and travel agents are now able to book reservations on Southwest. These direct connects offer the possibility to sell ancillary services and to differentiate oneself from the competition.&lt;ref&gt; Strauss, Michael (2010): Value Creation in Travel Distribution, https://www.amazon.com/dp/0557612462 &lt;/ref&gt;
*The development team at Travelport has developed an online search tool called ASK Travelport where registered users can go and find out the answers to their frequently asked questions and queries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8205">HP Cloud Service Automation (HP CSA) is cloud management software from [[Hewlett-Packard]] that is used by companies and government agencies to automate the management of cloud-based IT-as-a-service, from order, to provision, and retirement.&lt;ref name="neovise"&gt;[http://www.neovise.com/node/238 "HP Cloud Service Automation," Neovise]&lt;/ref&gt; HP Cloud Service Automation orchestrates the provisioning and deployment of complex IT services such as of [[database]]s, [[middleware]], and packaged applications (i.e., ERP, Exchange).&lt;ref name="joab"&gt;Jackson, Joab. "HP updates IT automation suite for cloud deployments," May 13, 2013. InfoWorld. [http://www.infoworld.com/d/cloud-computing/hp-updates-it-automation-suite-cloud-deployments-218447?page=0,0]&lt;/ref&gt; The software speeds deployment of application-based services across hybrid cloud delivery platforms and traditional IT environments.&lt;ref name="joab" /&gt;

The software is part of a broad portfolio of HP enterprise management software products aimed at helping companies manage the lifecycle of deployment and usage of [[cloud computing]], whether through public or private clouds, or both.

==Background on Cloud Computing and Automation==

According to the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], Information Technology Laboratory, “Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/cloud-computing/index.html National Institute of Standards and Technology. October 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many organizations are adopting cloud computing because it allows them to access applications, resources and services over the Internet on an “as-needed” or “per usage” basis. This has some cost and agility advantages for the IT department. According to a January 2011 [[Unisys]] poll, nearly half of U.S. companies consider cloud computing as the top IT priority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unisys.com/unisys/news/detail.jsp?id=1120000970009610085 Unisys news release.  Cloud Computing Dominates IT Priority List for 2011, Unisys Polls Show.  Jan. 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;

While cloud computing can save IT departments money and increase flexibility, it does present some challenges.  These challenges include extra effort and increased difficulty for the IT department because of the complexity associated with the deployment and ongoing management of cloud infrastructure and applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://briefingsdirectblog.blogspot.com/2010/06/hp-bto-executive-on-how-cloud-service.html Dana Gardner’s Briefings Direct. “Cloud Service automation aids visibility and control.” June 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Automation and proper management are important when IT departments deploy cloud computing services because of these challenges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itbusinessedge.com/cm/blogs/cole/cloud-migration-whos-up-to-the-challenge/?cs=44867 IT Business Edge. “Cloud migration.  Who’s up to the challenge?” Cole. Dec. 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[International Data Corporation]] (IDC), the use of distributed server/workload automation tools can help lower capital and power and cooling costs by tracking and reclaiming [[virtual machine]]s, making IT staff more efficient by standardizing and streamlining manual processes, and speed the process of provisioning IT resources by enabling business users the ability to self-provision predefined IT resource.&lt;ref&gt;IDC, "IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Distributed Server/Workload Automation Software 2012 Vendor Analysis," July 2012. [http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=236186]&lt;/ref&gt;

==What HP Cloud Service Automation Does==

The function of HP Cloud Service Automation is to accelerate the speed of deployment of application-based services across a hybrid cloud delivery environment.&lt;ref name="joab" /&gt; Traditionally, IT staff were required to patch and update physical servers manually.&lt;ref name="joab" /&gt; Using HP Cloud Service Automation, IT organizations can update thousands of servers automatically.&lt;ref name="joab" /&gt;

HP Cloud Service Automation allows IT departments to move and manage applications among in-house (private) cloud systems, external (public) clouds and traditional IT systems.  HP Cloud Service Automation software is also designed to deliver unified security, governance and compliance across applications, as well as physical and virtual infrastructures.  The software automates key IT processes so that there is one consistent approach to IT resource management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoworld.com/d/cloud-computing/hp-launch-enterprise-cloud-service-371  IDG News Service: Infoworld.com. “HP to launch enterprise cloud service.” Jackson. January 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

HP Cloud Service Automation also allows IT departments to dynamically monitor and provision server, storage and network elements as well as applications to meet the needs of current and upcoming workloads.   In addition, the solution allows IT to automatically grow and shrink the allocated resources in order to meet quality of service targets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-news/article_detail.html?compURI=tcm:245-595768&amp;pageTitle  HP News Release. “HP Launches CloudStart to Fast Track Private Clouds.” Aug. 2010.”]&lt;/ref&gt;

HP Cloud Service Automation Software is a component of HP VirtualSystem, a series of integrated server, storage, and networking infrastructures from HP for Citrix, HP-UX, Microsoft, and VMware virtual environments.&lt;ref&gt;"HP helps enterprise speed deployment of virtualization technologies," Datacenter Solutions UK, January 26, 2012. [http://www.dcsuk.info/news_full.php?id=21022&amp;title=HP-helps-enterprises-speed-deployment-of-virtualization-technologies]&lt;/ref&gt; HP VirtualSystem is part of the [[HP Converged Systems]] portfolio of system-based products that use [[Converged infrastructure]] for specific workloads. HP Cloud Service Automation Software is also included in [[HP CloudSystem]], a cloud infrastructure from HP that combines storage, servers, networking and software for organizations to build complete private, public and hybrid Cloud computing environments.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Carl. "HP CloudSystem: What exactly is it?" SearchCloudComputing, June 27, 2011
[http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/news/2240037306/HP-CloudSystem-What-exactly-is-it]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Product Packaging==

In May 2013, HP packaged version 10 of HP Operations Orchestration, version 10 of HP Server Automation, version 10 of HP Database and Middleware Automation and HP Cloud Service Automation 3.2 into a single integrated package.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infoworld.com/d/cloud-computing/hp-updates-it-automation-suite-cloud-deployments-218447&lt;/ref&gt; HP Cloud Service Automation is also available as a standalone software solution.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2013/05/13/hp-updates-cloud-management-software/&lt;/ref&gt;

==What HP Cloud Service Automation Works With==

HP Cloud Service Automation works with HP Operations Orchestration and HP Server Automation to provide IT lifecycle automation. HP Operations Orchestration is an integrated set of software and services that helps to automate distributed systems and heterogeneous computing environments. User organizations use HP OO to link together separate applications to create a workflow across them.&lt;ref name="joab" /&gt; HP Server Automation is used to manage physical and virtual servers as a lifecycle management platform. According to HP, HP SA helps to reduce administrator-to-server ratio by up to 60%.&lt;ref&gt;Rath, John. "HP updates cloud management software," 05/13/2013.

The '''Ifo Business Climate Index''' is a closely followed leading indicator for economic activity in Germany prepared by the [[Ifo Institute for Economic Research]] in [[Munich]], [[Germany]].

== Elements ==

The responses to the survey questionnaire, described below, are evaluated and seasonally adjusted. An index value of 100 corresponds to the survey data as of 1 January 2005. Since January 1991 more than 200 data sets have been published.

Three data series are compiled from the raw survey data:

* business climate
* current business situation
* business outlook

These three components are published as the percentage change over the previous month and as the absolute value with regard to the index reference data, 1 January 2005 = 100. Given the growing importance of the services sector in Germany, Ifo changed the business climate indicator in 2018 to rebase the index and include responses from the services sector in its calculations.&lt;ref&gt;Joern Poltz (April 6, 2018), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-economy-ifo-exclusive/exclusive-ifo-to-change-german-business-climate-index-from-april-to-include-services-idUSKCN1HD1BL Exclusive: Ifo to change German business climate index from April to include services] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often the results are depicted in the form of a "business-cycle clock".

== Procedure ==

Every month approximately 7,000 survey participants from firms in manufacturing, construction, wholesaling and retailing are requested to assess their current business situation as well as their business outlook for the coming six months. The Ifo Business Climate has been released monthly by the Ifo Institute since 1972.

=== Questionnaire ===

The firms are queried as to

* their current business situation, with the following choices
** good
** satisfactory
** poor
* their six-month business outlook, with these three choices
** more favorable
** unchanged
** less favorable

=== Evaluation method ===

The balance value of the current business situation is the difference in percentage shares of the responses "good" and "poor"; the balance value of the expectations is the difference in percentage shares of the responses "more favorable" and "less favorable". The business climate is a geometric mean of the balances of the business situation and the business expectations. To calculate the index value, the business climate the transformed balances are normalized to the average of the year 2015&lt;ref&gt;https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/konjunktur/nachrichten/ifo-geschaeftsklimaindex-die-hochstimmung-in-den-deutschen-chefetagen-verfliegt/21206778.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Interpretation ===

As an indicator of economic activity, the Business Climate Index is meant to supplement data from the official statistics, over which it has the advantage of being more frequently compiled and more rapidly accessible (GDP, for example, is only released quarterly and published with a delay of ca. two quarters, with the likelihood of subsequent revisions).

The particular importance of the Ifo Business Climate Index is forecasting turning points in economic growth. A cyclical turning point is reliably indicated following the "three-times rule", that is movement in a particular direction three months in succession.&lt;ref name="Kunkel"&gt;Kunkel, André (2003): [http://www.cesifo.de/pls/guest/download/ifo%20Diskussionsbeitraege/ifodpaper80.pdf Zur Prognosefähigkeit des ifo-Geschäftsklimas und seiner Komponenten sowie die Überprüfung der „Dreimal-Regel“], ifo-Diskussionsbeiträge, Nr.80&lt;/ref&gt;

== Highest and lowest values ==

The Index reached its lowest value in united Germany in March 2009 with 82.2 points. In December 2008 the ''business expectations'' component hit an all-time low of 76.9 points. The lowest level of the second component of the Index, ''business situation'', was at its lowest point in May 2009 with 82.5 points.

The all-time high of the Ifo Index was reached in December 2010 with 109.5 index points, surpassing the previous record high of 108.8 points in December 2006. In March 2006 the surveyed firms gave the best-ever appraisals of the business outlook, with an index value of 105.3.

An '''issue tracking system''' (also '''ITS''', '''trouble ticket system,''' '''support ticket,'''  '''request management''' or '''incident ticket system''') is a [[computer software]] package that manages and maintains lists of [[Issue (computers)|issues]].&lt;ref&gt;Bertram, Dane. [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e9df/1819e362adbf55e66a9a8a70ee1618a0fc1d.pdf The social nature of issue tracking in software engineering]. Diss. University of Calgary, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Issue tracking systems are generally used in [[collaboration|collaborative]] settings—especially in large or distributed collaborations—but can also be employed by individuals as part of a [[time management]] or [[productivity software|personal productivity]] regime. These systems often encompass resource allocation, time accounting, priority management, and oversight workflow in addition to implementing a centralized issue registry. 

In the institutional setting, issue tracking systems are commonly used in an organization's [[customer support]] [[call center]] to create, update, and resolve reported customer issues, or even issues reported by that organization's other employees. A support ticket should include vital information for the account involved and the issue encountered. An issue tracking system often also contains a [[knowledge base]] containing information on each customer, resolutions to common problems, and other such data. 

An issue tracking system is similar to a "[[bugtracker]]", and often, a software company will sell both, and some bugtrackers are capable of being used as an issue tracking system, and vice versa. Consistent use of an issue or [[bug tracking system]] is considered one of the "hallmarks of a good software team".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000029.html |title=Painless Bug Tracking|author=Joel Spolsky|accessdate=29 October 2010|date=November 8, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A '''ticket''' element, within an issue tracking system, is a running report on a particular problem, its status, and other relevant data. They are commonly created in a [[help desk]] or [[call center]] environment and almost always have a unique reference number, also known as a ''case'', ''issue'' or ''call log'' number which is used to allow the user or help staff to quickly locate, add to or communicate the status of the user's issue or request.

These tickets are so called because of their origin as small cards within a traditional wall mounted work planning system when this kind of support started. Operators or staff receiving a call or query from a user would fill out a small card with the user's details and a brief summary of the request and place it into a position (usually the last) in a column of ''pending slots'' for an appropriate engineer, so determining the staff member who would deal with the query and the priority of the request.

The shared conceptual foundation between issue tracking systems and bugtrackers is that a valid issue must be amenable to a decisive resolution (such as "completed", "fixed", or a group consensus that the issue is not worth solving, such as "not a problem" or "won't fix"); that each issue is unique (duplicate problem reports are in most cases promptly amalgamated into a single active issue or ticket); and—beyond the screening stage—that there is precisely one person assigned formal responsibility to move the issue forward (this formal baton will often bounce around many times as the issue evolves). In bugtrackers, issues are generally quality or feature related with respect to a codebase (which is inherently a [[project management]] setting) whereas in generalized issue tracking systems, the tickets are often service-related or relationship-based, with closer ties to [[customer relationship management]] (CRM) concerns. 

==Issues==

Issues can have several aspects to them. Each issue in the system may have an urgency value assigned to it, based on the overall importance of that issue. Low or zero urgency issues are minor and should be resolved as time permits.
Other details of issues include the customer experiencing the issue (whether external or internal), date of submission, detailed descriptions of the problem being experienced, attempted solutions or work-arounds, and other relevant information. As previously noted, each issue maintains a history of each change.

==Functions==
Issue-tracking systems fulfill different functions, in particular:
* Entering of dysfunctions, errors and requests (e.g. manually or by e-mail Response Management Systems)
* Distribution and assignment of issues to persons in charge
* Monitoring of handling, time spent and quality of work
* Ensuring the observation of internal processes by forced control with help of workflows
* Statistical analysis of the number of tickets
* Automatic generation of tickets by alarming systems, e.g. [[network monitoring]]
* Fulfillment of external service agreements (Service Level Agreement, [[Service-level_agreement|SLA]])
* Systematic collection of questions and answers for [[FAQ]]s
* Assignment of a priority to each issue based on the overall importance of that issue, the customer, date of submission, SLA
* Containing a detailed descriptions of the problem being experienced, attempted solutions or workarounds, and other relevant information
* Maintaining of a history of each change

==Workflow==

An example scenario is presented to demonstrate how a common issue tracking system would work:

# A customer service technician receives a [[telephone]] call, [[email]], or other communication from a customer about a problem. Some applications provide built-in messaging system and automatic error reporting from [[exception handling]] blocks.
# The technician verifies that the problem is real, and not just perceived. The technician will also ensure that enough information about the problem is obtained from the customer. This information generally includes the environment of the customer, when and how the issue occurs, and all other relevant circumstances.
# The technician creates the issue in the system, entering all relevant data, as provided by the customer.
# As work is done on that issue, the system is updated with new data by the technician. Any attempt at fixing the problem should be noted in the issue system. Ticket status most likely will be changed from open to pending.
# After the issue has been fully addressed, it is marked as resolved in the issue tracking system.

If the problem is not fully resolved, the ticket will be reopened once the technician receives new information from the customer.
A [[Run Book Automation]] process that implements best practices for these workflows and increases IT personnel effectiveness is becoming very common.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4739">'''JetForm''' was the name of a Canadian software manufacturer created by four consultants (Wayne Hall, Bob Allum, Tom Hicks, and John Gleed) that was based out of [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] and an electronic form software product of the same name.

JetForm once had major offices in the [[United States]], various countries in Europe, [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]]. It was founded in 1982, and was listed under [[NASDAQ]] as FORMF, under the [[Pacific Stock Exchange]] as JTF, and the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] as JFM.

==History==
The company was originally named Indigo Software and was solely a software consulting firm. Indigo Software did work for the [[Government of Canada|Canadian Federal Government]] and [[IBM]] (as the maintainer of an IBM CAD software product); among other clients.  One significant government project resulted in an electronic forms product being created: iFiller, iPrint, et al.

With [[Microsoft]]'s release of [[Windows 3.1x|Windows 3.11]], Indigo Software did a major enhancement to the forms software and re-branded it JetForm.  The JetForm forms product was very successful, and Indigo Software's consulting work also began to focus on work associated with the JetForm software. Given the popularity of the forms software, Indigo Software made a decision to rename the company JetForm.

Its [[eponym]]ous series of products directly competed against other electronic forms software, such as [[Delrina]]'s [[PerForm]], and [[FormFlow]] products.

In September, 1996, [[Symantec]], which had bought Delrina the previous year, sold their Electronic Forms Division to JetForm. JetForm continued to develop the FormFlow series of products under its own name.

Around this time, JetForm bought the [[naming rights]] to the [[Ottawa Baseball Stadium]], naming it "JetForm Park".

On September 13, 2001, JetForm changed its name to Accelio. Accelio was acquired by [[Adobe Systems]] in February 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200202/200202accelioacq.html | title=Accelio acquisition press release | accessdate=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The electronic forms products were officially retired in 2004. Adobe marketed JetForm as Adobe Central Output Server [http://www.adobe.com/products/server/outputserver/], without any major changes. Adobe's successor for the JetForm technology was released June 7, 2007, as Adobe LiveCycle Enterprise Suite (ES)[http://www.adobe.com/products/livecycle/], part of the [[Adobe LiveCycle]] suite. The product was renamed again in April 9, 2009 to Adobe Central / Central Pro Output Server and reached its end of [https://www.adobe.com/support/products/enterprise/eol/eol_matrix.html#6 Extended Support] on June 30, 2016.  

JetForm Rises Again, In 2007 two of the original founders Tom Hicks, Wayne Hall and four of the core software developers of JetForm Central came together to build a new enterprise class document designer, merge engine, presentation and delivery system. The software is called DocOrigin (a play off the Origin of Documents). DocOrigin was first released in 2009 and in 2013 version 3.0 was released.

==JetForm Software==

'''JetForm Design''' allowed for routing and tracking in workflow systems, on-screen form creation, and access to [[SQL]] and [[ODBC]]-compliant databases. '''JetForm Filler''' was used for completing on-screen forms. JetForm also developed the XML form format [https://web.archive.org/web/20091223030550/http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/xml/index_arch.html "XFA"], which was later adopted by Adobe into its PDF software.

One of the Indigo Forms software's innovations when it was introduced was its ability to have its forms installed into Laserjet font cartridges. This meant that the product only had to send forms data to the printer; since the form was already encoded in the font cartridge. Given the slow printer interfaces used at that time, this greatly reduced print times.

Kata, a Japanese word, meaning {{Nihongo||[[wikt:型|型]] or [[wikt:形|形]]|literally: "form"}}, is a detailed choreographed pattern of movements made to be practiced alone, but are also practiced within groups and in unison when training. It is practiced as a way to memorize and perfect the movement being executed. There are many professions which use the term Kata, but Kata as a term is known generally by the Martial Arts world, and typically reserved for Japanese empty hand combat systems (Karate -meaning empty hand). Traditional Korean Karate, called (Tang Soo Do) uses the term Kata and some Tang Soo Do schools do not, which is brought on by the memory of the Japanese and Korean war, where in at that time traditional Korean Karate was introduced.

Kata are used in many traditional Japanese arts such as theatre forms like [[kabuki]] and schools of tea ceremony (''[[chadō]]''), but are most commonly known for the presence in the martial arts. Kata are used by most [[Japanese martial arts|Japanese]] and [[Okinawan martial arts]], such as [[aikido]], [[judo]], [[kendo]], [[kempo]], and [[karate]].

== Background ==
Kata originally were teaching and training methods by which successful combat techniques were preserved and passed on. Practicing kata allowed a company of persons to engage in a struggle using a systematic approaches, rather by practicing in a repetitive manner the learner develops the ability to execute those techniques and movements in a natural, reflex-like manner. Systematic practice does not mean permanently rigid. The goal is to internalize the movements and techniques of a kata so they can be executed and adapted under different circumstances, without thought or hesitation. A novice’s actions will look uneven and difficult, while a master’s appear simple and smooth.&lt;ref name="Rosen"&gt;Rosenbaum, Michael. ''Kata and the Transmission of Knowledge in Traditional Martial Arts.'' YMAA Publication Center, Boston, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kata'' is a loanword in English, from the 1950s in reference to the [[judo kata]] due to [[Jigoro Kano]], and from the 1970s also of [[karate kata]]; but the word has come to be used as a generic term for "forms" in martial arts in general, or even figuratively applied to other fields.&lt;ref name="Rother"&gt;{{cite book | title=Toyota Kata: Managing People for Improvement, Adaptiveness, and Super Results | publisher=McGraw Hill Education | author=Rother, Mike | year=2010 | location=New York | pages=15-18 | isbn=978007163523-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Japanese martial arts ==
In Japanese martial arts practice, kata is often seen as an essential partner to ''[[randori]]'' training with one complementing the other.{{cn|date=May 2014}} However, the actual type and frequency of kata versus ''randori'' training varies from art to art.{{cn|date=May 2014}} In [[iaido]], solo kata using the Japanese sword ([[katana]]) comprises almost all of the training.{{cn|date=May 2014}} Whereas in [[judo]], kata training is de-emphasized and usually only prepared for [[dan rank|dan]] grading.{{cn|date=May 2014}}

In [[kenjutsu]], paired kata at the beginners level can appear to be stilted.{{cn|date=May 2014}} At higher levels serious injury is prevented only by a high sensitivity of both participants to important concepts being taught and trained for.{{cn|date=May 2014}} These include timing and distance, with the kata practiced at realistic speed. This adjustability of kata training is found in other Japanese arts with roles of attacker and defender often interchanging within the sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Classical Japanese Warrior Training Methods The Kata|url=https://shinmunenryu.org/2018/02/01/classical-japanese-warrior-training-methods-kata/|website=www.shinmunenryu.org|accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many martial arts use kata for public demonstrations and in competitions, awarding points for such aspects of technique as style, balance, timing, and verisimilitude (appearance of being real).{{cn|date=May 2014}}

=== Karate ===
{{main|Karate kata}}

The most popular image associated with kata is that of a [[karate]] practitioner performing a series of punches and kicks in the air. The kata are executed as a specified series of approximately 20 to 70 moves, generally with stepping and turning, while attempting to maintain perfect form. There are perhaps 100 kata across the various forms of karate, each with many minor variations. The number of moves in a kata may be referred to in the name of the kata, e.g., ''Gojū Shiho'', which means "54 steps." The number of moves may also have links with Buddhist spirituality. The number 108 is significant in Buddhism &amp; Hinduism, and kata with 54, 36, or 27 moves (divisors of 108) are common. The practitioner is generally counselled to visualize the enemy attacks, and his responses, as actually occurring, and ''karateka'' are often told to "read" a kata, to explain the imagined events. Kata can contain techniques beyond the superficially obvious ones. The study of the meaning of the movements is referred to as the [[bunkai]], meaning analysis, of the kata.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110208012048/http://kata-reference.com/ Karate, Okinawan Kobudo and Kendo Kata videos]&lt;/ref&gt;

One explanation of the use of kata is as a reference guide for a set of moves. Not to be used following that "set" pattern but to keep the movements "filed". After learning these kata, this set of learned skills can then be used in a [[sparring]] scenario (particularly without points).

Recently, with the spread of Extreme Martial arts or XMA, a style of kata called CMX kata has formed.{{cn|date=May 2014}} These kata are performed in tournaments and include gymnastics related elements, such as backflips, cartwheels, and splits.{{cn|date=May 2014}} These kata can also be performed with weapons such as the Bo staff.{{cn|date=May 2014}}

{{main|Judo kata}}
[[Judo]] has several kata, mostly created in the late 19th century by [[Kano Jigoro]], the founder of judo. The judo kata involve two participants. Judo kata preserve a number of techniques that are not permitted in competition or in ''randori'', including punches, kicks, and the use of the [[katana]] and other weapons. The study of kata is usually begun typically at around the green belt level. The most commonly studied judo kata is [[Nage-no-kata]], which consists of fifteen throwing techniques. The [[Katame-no-kata]] is composed of pinning techniques, chokes, and joint locks. [[Kime-no-kata]] is a long kata consisting of self-defense techniques against both unarmed attacks, and attacks with swords and knives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.judoinfo.com/katamenu.htm|title=Forms of Judo: Kata – Judo Info|website=www.judoinfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.judo-snijders.nl/engels/video-kata-judo.html|title=Kata, nage, karame, gonosen, itsutsu, kime, no, video, movie, film, armlock, judo, Judoschool Jan Snijders, Oirschot, Bladel, Deurne, Gemert|first=|last=R.GROULS@WXS.NL|website=www.judo-snijders.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Japanese term is most well known in the English language, forms are by no means exclusive to Japan. They have been recorded in [[China]] as early as the [[Tang dynasty]], and are referred to in Mandarin as ''[[Taolu (martial arts)|taolu]]''.{{cn|date=May 2014}}

South and [[Indochinese martial arts|Southeast Asian martial arts]] incorporate both preset and freestyle forms. In [[silat]] these are referred to as ''jurus'' and ''tari'' respectively. Malay folklore credits the introduction of forms to the Buddhist monk [[Bodhidharma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Silat Tua: The Malay Dance Of Life |author=Zainal Abidin Shaikh Awab and Nigel Sutton |year=2006 |publisher=Azlan Ghanie Sdn Bhd |location=Kuala Lumpur |isbn=978-983-42328-0-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[:Category:Korean martial arts|Korean martial arts]] such as [[taekwondo]] and [[Tang Soo Do]], the word ''[[hyung]]'' or ''hyeong'' is usually employed, though in some cases other words are used.{{cn|date=May 2014}} The [[International Taekwon-Do Federation]] uses the word ''[[Hyung|tul]]'', while the [[World Taekwondo Federation]] uses the word ''poomsae'' or simply the English translations "[[pattern]]" or "form."{{cn|date=May 2014}} Taekwondo patterns have multiple variations including ''Palgwe'' and the more popular ''Taeguk'' forms used by the WTF. Forms are included in certain taekwondo competitions and are a key element of gradings.{{cn|date=May 2014}}

In [[Sanskrit]], forms are known either as ''yudhan'' (combat form) or ''pentra'' (tactical deployment).{{cn|date=May 2014}} Other [[Asian martial arts]] refer to forms by various terms specific to their respective languages, such as the Burmese word ''[[aka (Burmese)|aka]]'', the Vietnamese ''quyen'' and the Kashmiri ''khawankay''.{{cn|date=May 2014}}

In the [[Historical European martial arts]] and their modern reconstructions, forms are referred to as plays, drills or flourishes.{{cn|date=May 2014}}

{{other uses}}
More recently [[:wikt:kata#English|kata]] has come to be used in English in a more general or figurative sense,  referring  to any basic form, routine, or pattern of behavior that is practiced to various levels of mastery.&lt;ref&gt;Shook, John. ''Managing to Learn.'' Lean Enterprise Institute, 2008, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japanese language ''kata'' (though written as 方) is a frequently-used suffix meaning “way of doing,” with emphasis on the form and order of the process.  Other meanings are “training method” and “formal exercise.”  The goal of a painter’s practicing, for example, is to merge his consciousness with his brush; the potter’s with his clay; the garden designer’s with the materials of the garden.  Once such mastery is achieved, the theory goes, the doing of a thing perfectly is as easy as thinking it.&lt;ref&gt;DeMenthe, Boye Lafayette. ''Kata, The Key to Understanding and Dealing with the Japanese!'' Tuttle Publishing, 2003, pp. 1–3&lt;/ref&gt;

Kata is a term used by some programmers in the Software Craftsmanship&lt;ref&gt;[[Software craftsmanship|The Software Craftsmanship Movement]]&lt;/ref&gt; movement. Computer programmers who call themselves "Software Craftsmen"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.8thlight.com/micah-martin/2013/05/28/performing-code-katas.html|title=Performing Code Katas - 8th Light|website=8thlight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; will write 'Kata'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/home/articles/what-s-all-this-nonsense-about-katas|title=What's all this Nonsense about Katas? - Clean Coder|website=sites.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; - small snippets of code that they write in one sitting, sometimes repeatedly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://codekata.com/kata/codekata-how-it-started/|title=CodeKata: How It Started - CodeKata|first=Dave Thomas|last=(@PragDave)|website=codekata.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; often daily, in order to build muscle memory and practise their craft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/home/articles/what-s-all-this-nonsense-about-katas|title=What's all this Nonsense about Katas? - Clean Coder|website=sites.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the things that characterize an organization’s culture is its kata – its routines of thinking and practice.&lt;ref&gt;Ichijo, Kazuo and Nonaka, Ikujiro, Knowledge Creation and Management:  New Challenges for Managers, Oxford University Press, 2006, page 25&lt;/ref&gt;  Edgar Schein suggests an organization's culture helps it cope with its environment,&lt;ref&gt;Schein, Edgar. ''Organizational Culture and Leadership: A Dynamic View.'' Jossey-Bass, 1985, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; and one meaning of ''kata'' is, "a way to keep two things in sync or harmony with one another." A task for leaders and managers is to create and maintain the organizational culture through consistent role modeling, teaching, and coaching, which is in many ways analogous to how kata are taught in the martial arts.

{{Business administration}}

A '''business entity''' is an entity that is formed and administered as per [[corporate law]] in order to engage in [[business]] activities, charitable work, or other activities allowable. Most often, business entities are formed to sell a product or a service.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} There are many types of [[business entities]] defined in the legal systems of various countries. These include [[corporation]]s, [[cooperative]]s, [[partnership]]s, [[sole trader]]s, [[limited liability company|limited liability companies]] and other specifically permitted and labelled types of entities. The specific rules vary by country and by state or province. Some of these types are listed below, by country. For guidance, approximate equivalents in the company law of English-speaking countries are given in most cases, for example:

:≈ [[Ltd.]] (UK, Ireland and the Commonwealth)
:≈ [[public limited company]] (UK, Ireland and the Commonwealth)
:≈ [[limited partnership]]
:≈ unlimited partnership
:≈ [[chartered company]]
:≈ [[Statutory corporation|statutory company]]
:≈ [[holding company]]
:≈ [[Subsidiary|subsidiary company]]
:≈ one man company ([[sole proprietorship]])
:≈ [[charitable incorporated organisation]] (UK)
:≈ [[non-governmental organization]]

However, the regulations governing particular types of entities, even those described as roughly equivalent, differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. When creating or restructuring a business, the legal responsibilities will depend on the type of business entity chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Choose a legal structure for a new business |url=https://www.gov.uk/business-legal-structures |publisher=[[GOV.UK]] |accessdate=19 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115173536/https://www.gov.uk/business-legal-structures# |archive-date=2013-01-15 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
In Canada entities can be incorporated under either federal or provincial (or territorial) law. [[Unlimited liability corporation]]s can be formed in Alberta "AULC" and Nova Scotia "NSULC".

The word or expression "Limited", ''Limitée'', "Incorporated", ''Incorporée'', "Corporation" or ''Société par actions de régime fédéral'' or the corresponding abbreviation "Ltd.", ''Ltée'', "Inc.", "Corp." or ''S.A.R.F.'' forms part of the name of every entity incorporated under the [[Canada Business Corporations Act]] (R.S., 1985, c. C-44). ≈ Ltd. or Plc (UK)

As an exception, entities registered prior to 1985 may continue to be designated ''Société commerciale canadienne'' or by the abbreviation ''S.C.C.''

Under the [[Canada Cooperatives Act]] (1998, c. 1), a co-operative must have the word "cooperative", "co-operative", "coop", "co-op", ''coopérative'', "united" or "pool", or another grammatical form of any of those words, as part of its name.

Unlike in many other Western countries, Canadian businesses generally only have one form of incorporation available. The aforementioned AULC and NSULC are generally not used as operating business structures, but are instead used to create favorable tax positions for either Americans investing in Canada or vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camagazine.com/archives/print-edition/2006/january-february/regulars/camagazine7794.aspx|title=NS vs. Alberta ULCs|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723021544/http://www.camagazine.com/archives/print-edition/2006/january-february/regulars/camagazine7794.aspx#|archive-date=2014-07-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather, Canadian businesses are generally formed under one of the following structures:
*SP (Sole Proprietorship): No formal business structure is established
*GP (General Partnership): Either a formal structure with a partnership agreement, or an informal structure, in which case the Partnerships Act for the province will apply
*LP (Limited Partnership): An investment structure, limiting both the liability and the participation of the investor. An investor who takes an active role will be deemed a general partner, and become exposed to unlimited liability.
*Corporation
*Joint Venture: A business activity shared by two or more business entities. The joint venture's activities must be finite in terms of either time or scope.

There are three main forms of business:

(a) Sole Proprietorship
(b) Partnership
(c) Company

*Sole Proprietorship

In a sole proprietorship, an individual on his/her own account carries out the business or profession. No formal procedure or formality is required for setting up a sole proprietary concern.

*Partnership

A partnership is a business relationship entered into by a formal agreement between two or more persons or corporations carrying on a business in common. The capital for a partnership is provided by the partners who are liable for the total debts of the firms and who share the profits and losses of the business concern according to the terms of the partnership agreement.

Partnerships (other than banking companies) are generally limited in size to twenty partners. The interest of a partner is transferable only with the prior consent of the other partner(s). However, a partner's right to a share of the partnership income may be received in trust for another person.

For taxation purposes, partnerships are classified into:

(i) Registered Firms
(ii) Unregistered Firms

The income of the registered firm is subject to Super Tax before distribution to the partners. Also the individual income of the partners is subject to income tax at the usual rates.

For unregistered firms, income tax is levied on the firm's income and the partners are not liable to pay tax on the shares of profit received from the unregistered firm(s).

*Company

A company is a legal entity formed under the Companies Ordinance, 1984. It can have share capital or can be formed without share capital.

A company having share capital may be formed as:

(i) A company limited by shares.
(ii) A company limited by guarantee.
(iii) An unlimited company.

*Company Limited by Shares

The liability of its members is limited to the extent of their shares in the paid-up capital of the company. These companies may further be classified as public limited and private limited companies.

*Public Limited Companies can be formed by at least seven persons by subscribing their names to the 'Memorandum and Articles of Association' of the company. The word 'Limited' is used as the last word of its name.
*Private Limited Companies may be formed by at least two persons by subscribing their names to the 'Memorandum and Articles of Association' of the company. A private limited company, by its Articles of Association:

(i) Restricts the right to transfer its shares;
(ii) Limits the number of its members to fifty; and;
(iii) Prohibits any invitation to the public to subscribe for shares or debentures of the company.

A private limited company is required to use the words "(Private) Limited" as the last words of its name.

*Company Limited By Guarantee

Means a company having the liability of its members limited by memorandum to such amounts as the members may respectively undertake to contribute to the capital of the company in the event of its winding up. A company limited by guarantee is usually formed on a 'non profit basis'. Companies limited by guarantee use the words (Guarantee) Limited" as the last words of their n
Unlimited Company

Means a company having unlimited liability of its members

==United States==
In the United States, the individual states incorporate most businesses. Very few special types are incorporated by the federal government.

=== Tax classifications ===
For federal tax purposes, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] has separate [[entity classification]] rules. Under the tax rules, an entity may be classified as a [[corporation]], a [[partnership]], a [[Cooperative]] or a disregarded entity. A corporation may be taxed as either a [[C corporation]] or elect to be treated as a [[Subchapter S corporation]]. A disregarded entity has one owner (or a married couple as owner) that is not recognized for tax purposes as an entity separate from its owner. Types of disregarded entities include single-member [[Limited liability company|LLC]]s; qualified sub-chapter S subsidiaries and qualified [[real estate investment trust]] subsidiaries. A disregarded entity's transparent tax status does not affect its status under state law. For example, for federal tax purposes, a sole-member LLC (SMLLC) is disregarded, so that all its assets and liabilities are treated as owned by its single member. But under state law, an SMLLC can contract in its own name and its owner is generally not personally liable for the debts and obligations of the entity.&lt;ref name="Presti and Naegele Newsletter"&gt;[http://www.prestinaegele.com/faq-what-is-a-disregarded-entity Presti and Naegele Newsletter] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115173503/http://www.prestinaegele.com/faq-what-is-a-disregarded-entity# |date=2013-01-15 }}, 4 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; To be recognized as a [[Cooperative]] for tax purposes Cooperatives must follow certain rules under Sub Chapter T of the [[Internal Revenue Code]].&lt;ref name="IRS Sub Chapter T"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/irm/part4/irm_04-044-001.html#d0e184|title=IRS Sub Chapter T|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904163915/http://www.irs.gov/irm/part4/irm_04-044-001.html#d0e184#d0e184|archive-date=2014-09-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federally incorporated===
The key word for a bank is "national". A bank chartered by the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] (OCC) must have the word "national" in its name. A bank chartered by a state cannot have "national" in its name.

For a savings bank (formerly called a savings and loan association) or credit union, the key word is "federal", and the same rules apply; a federally chartered savings bank or credit union must have the word "federal" in its name, while a state chartered savings bank or credit union cannot have "federal" in its name.

*FSB ([[Federal savings bank|Federal Savings Bank]]), formerly called federal savings and loan association
*NA ([[National bank#United States|National Association]]), a designation used by banks chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)
*NT&amp;SA ([[National Trust and Savings Association]]), a less common designation used by national banks
*[[Credit union#United States|Federal Credit Union]], chartered by the National Credit Union Association (NCUA)

Many federal governmental units are specially formed [[Government-owned corporation|public corporation]]s, while some private organizations have received a [[Congressional charter|charter from Congress]].

===State, territory or commonwealth incorporated===
{{See also|United States corporate law}}

The following are the main business designations and types:
*'''[[Sole proprietorship]]''': a business consisting of a single owner (which may in turn be a business entity), not in a separately recognized business form.
*'''[[Trust (business)|Trust]]'''

====Partnerships====
*'''[[General partnership]]''': a partnership in which all the partners are jointly and separately liable for the debts of the partnership. In most U.S. states, it can be created by agreement without requiring a public filing. The partners may themselves be legal entities or individuals.
*[[Limited partnership|LP]], '''Limited partnership''': a partnership where at least one partner (the general partner, which may itself be an entity or an individual) has unlimited liability for the LP's debts and one or more partners (the limited partners) have limited liability (which means that they are not responsible for the LP's debts beyond the amount they agreed to invest). Limited partners generally do not participate in the management of the entity or its business. 
*[[Limited liability partnership|LLP]], '''Limited Liability Partnership''': a partnership where a partner's liability for the debts of the partnership is limited except in the case of liability for acts of professional negligence or malpractice. In some states, LLPs may only be formed for purposes of practicing a licensed profession, typically attorneys, accountants and architects. This is often the only form of limited partnership allowed for law firms (as opposed to general partnerships).
*[[Limited liability limited partnership|LLLP]], '''Limited Liability Limited Partnership''': a combination of LP and LLP, available in some states.

====Limited Liability Companies====
*[[Limited liability company|LLC]], LC, Ltd. Co., '''Limited Liability Company''': a form of business whose owners enjoy limited liability, but which is not a [[corporation]]. Allowable abbreviations vary by state. Note that in some states ''Ltd.'' by itself is not a valid abbreviation for an LLC, because in some states (e.g. [[Texas]]), it may denote a corporation instead. See also [[Series LLC]]. For U.S. federal tax purposes, in general, an LLC with two or more members is treated as a partnership, and an LLC with one member is treated as a sole proprietorship.
*[[Limited liability company#Variations|PLLC]], '''Professional Limited Liability Company''': some states do not allow certain professionals to form an LLC that would limit the liability that results from the services professionals provide such as doctors, medical care; lawyers, legal advice; and accountants, accounting services; architects, architectural services; when the company formed offers the services of the professionals. Instead those states allow a PLLC or in the LLC statutes, the liability limitation only applies to the business side, such as creditors of the company, as opposed to the client/customer service side, the level of medical care, legal services, or accounting provided to clients. This is meant to maintain the higher ethical standards that these professionals have committed themselves to by becoming licensed in their profession and to prevent them from being immune (or at least limit their immunity) to malpractice suits.

====Corporations====
*[[Corporation|Corp.]], [[Incorporation (business)|Inc.]], '''Corporation, Incorporated''': used to denote [[corporation]]s ([[public company|public]] or otherwise). These are the only terms universally accepted by all 51 corporation chartering jurisdictions in the United States. However, in some states other suffixes may be used to identify a corporation, such as Ltd., Co./Company, or the Italian term S.p.A. (in [[Connecticut]]; see under [[#Italy|Italy]]). Some states that allow the use of "Company" prohibit the use of "and Company", "and Co.", "&amp; Company" or "&amp; Co.". In most states [[sole proprietorship]]s and partnerships may register a fictitious "[[doing business as]]" name with the word "Company" in it. For a full list of allowed designations by state, see the table below. 
*'''[[Professional corporation]]''', PC or P.C.: those corporate entities for which many corporation statutes make special provision, regulating the use of the corporate form by licensed professionals such as attorneys, architects, accountants, and doctors.
*'''[[Doing Business As]]''': denotes a business name used by a person or entity that is different from the person's or entity's true name. DBAs are not separate entities and do not shield the person or entity who uses the DBA as a business name from liability for debts or lawsuits. Filing requirements vary and are not permitted for some types of businesses or professional practices.  See also [[Delaware corporation]], [[Delaware statutory trust]], [[Nevada corporation]], and [[Massachusetts business trust]].

'''Managed services''' is the practice of [[outsourcing]] on a proactive basis certain processes and functions intended to  improve operations and cut expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title=Introduction to Managed Services     |url= http://www.ca.com/us/~/media/Files/whitepapers/introduction-to-Managed-services-wp.pdf    |date=September 2012  |author=     |publisher=[[CA Technologies]]  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Palachuk 208"&gt;{{cite book  | title= Managed Services in a Month  |url=http://www.managedservicesinamonth.com/index.html  | location = |last=Palachuk   |first =Karl | date =January 2013  | publisher =Great Little Book Publishing Co., Inc. |page=208  |isbn= 978-0981997858}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an alternative to the [[break/fix]] or [[on-demand outsourcing]] model where the service provider performs on-demand services and bills the customer only for the work done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title=An Insight Into IT Service Delivery: Traditional Break-Fix vs A Managed Service   |url=http://www.oryxalign.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/An-insight-into-IT-Service-Delivery_Break-fix-vs-Managed-Services.pdf     |date=   |author=OryxAlign   |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title=How Break/Fix Can Break Your Managed Services Business   |url=http://mspmentor.net/blog/how-breakfix-can-break-your-managed-services-business    |date=5 March 2010  |author= Nimsoft Guest   |publisher=MSPMentor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under this subscription model, the client or customer is the entity that owns or has direct oversight of the organization or system being managed whereas the Managed Services Provider (MSP) is the [[service provider]] delivering the managed services. The client and the MSP are bound by a contractual, service-level agreement that states the performance and quality metrics of their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title=11 Things to Cover in Your Managed Services Agreements |url= http://www.labtechsoftware.com/blog/11-things-to-cover-in-your-managed-services-agreements/    |date=20 October 2015  |author=Ron Williams |publisher=LabTech Software  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and evolution==
The evolution of MSP started in the 1990s with the emergence of application service providers (ASPs) who helped pave the way for remote support for IT infrastructure. From the initial focus of remote monitoring and management of servers and networks, the scope of an MSP's services expanded to include mobile device management, managed security, remote firewall administration and  security-as-a-service,  and managed print services. Around 2005, [[Karl Palachuk|Karl W. Palachuk]], Amy Luby (Founder of Managed Service Provider Services Network acquired by High Street Technology Ventures), and Erick Simpson (Managed Services Provider University) were the first advocates and the pioneers of the managed services business model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title=MSPmentor 250 List 2014: Honorees N to P   |url=http://mspmentor.net/mspmentor-250/mspmentor-250-list-2014-honorees-n-p    |date=2015  |author=    |publisher=MSPMentor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title=MSP Partners Recognizes Outstanding Contributions in Managed Services    |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20080807005757/en/MSP-Partners-Recognizes-Outstanding-Contributions-Managed-Services     |date=7 August 2008  |author=    |publisher=BusinessWire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first books on the topic of managed services: ''Service Agreements for SMB Consultants: A Quick-Start Guide to Managed Services''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | title= Service Agreements for SMB Consultants  |url=  | location = |last=Palachuk   |first =Karl | date =  | publisher =Great Little Book Publishing Co., Inc. |page= |isbn= 978-0976376026}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Guide to a Successful Managed Services Practice''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=The Guide to a Successful Managed Services Practice|last=Simpson|first=Erick|date=15 August 2006|publisher=Intelligent Enterprise|isbn=978-0978894306|location=|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; were published in 2006 by Palachuk and Simpson, respectively. Since then, the managed services [[business model]] has gained ground among enterprise level companies. As the [[value-added reseller]] (VAR) community evolved to higher level of services, it adapted the managed service model and tailored it to SMB companies.

In the new economy, IT manufacturers are currently moving away from a "box-shifting" resale to a more customized, managed service offering. In this transition, the billing and sales processes of [[intangible asset|intangible]] managed services, appear as the main challenges for traditional resellers.

The managed services market is expected to grow from an estimated $152.45 billion in 2017 to $257.84 billion by 2022, representing a [[Compound annual growth rate|CAGR]] of 11.1%. With IT driving all business operations, the significance of aligning managed IT services with all levels in an organization has grown to ensure reliability and continuity of business goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jonathan|first1=Stokes|title=Managed IT Services Can Spur the Growth of Your Business|url=https://medium.com/@stokesjonathan38/managed-it-services-can-spur-the-growth-of-your-business-6be486544c0f|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the information technology area, the most common managed services appear to evolve around connectivity and bandwidth, network monitoring, security,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title=How to use managed services to overcome the top 6 app security hurdles    |url=http://www.information-age.com/technology/security/123461048/how-use-managed-services-overcome-top-6-app-security-hurdles     |date= 7 March 2016     |author=Chloe Green  |publisher=Information Age  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[virtualization]], and disaster recovery.&lt;ref name="top5"/&gt; Beyond traditional application and infrastructure management, managed services may also include storage, desktop and communications, mobility, help desk and technical support.  In general, common managed services include the following applications.

== Managed services provider ==

===Definition===
A managed services provider (MSP) is most often an [[information technology]] (IT) services provider that manages and assumes responsibility for providing a defined set of services to its clients either proactively or as the MSP (not the client) determines that services are needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Managed service provider (MSP) |url= http://searchenterprisewan.techtarget.com/definition/managed-service-provider     |date=2015  |author=Margaret Rouse |publisher=[[TechTarget]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title=Top ten criteria for selecting a managed services provider     |url= http://www.ibm.com/midmarket/it/it/att/pdf/Top_ten_criteria.pdf |date=2015 |author= |publisher=IBM Global Technology Services }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most MSPs bill an upfront setup or transition fee and an ongoing flat or near-fixed monthly fee, which benefits clients by providing them with predictable IT support costs. Sometimes, MSPs act as facilitators who manage and procure staffing services on behalf of the client. In such context, they use an online application called [[vendor management system]] (VMS) for transparency and efficiency.

The managed services model has been useful in the private sector, notably among [[Fortune 500 |Fortune 500 companies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=60% of Fortune 500 Companies Running ManageEngine |url=http://mspmentor.net/managed-services/60-fortune-500-companies-running-manageengine |date=23 April 2012  |author=Joe Panettieri |publisher=MSPMentor}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has an interesting future in government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=IT Managed Services in the Public Sector |url=http://www.storagecraft.com/blog/it-managed-services-in-the-public-sector/ |date=4 June 2015 |author=Casey Morgan     |publisher=storagecraft }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover was founded in 1998 by [[Nick Denton]], David Galbraith, and Angus Bankes.&lt;ref&gt;guardian.co.uk, 9 March 2008. [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/mar/09/gawker "The Brit dishing the dirt on America"] "He turned to his old school friend Dave Galbraith who, though now trained as an architect, had been writing software for years. Together with another mutual schoolfriend, Angus Bankes, they would come up with the software to support Moreover.com."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PR Newswire, 21 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014, Moreover was acquired by [[LexisNexis]].&lt;ref name="lexis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moreover.com/blog/2014/10/20/moreover-joins-lexisnexis/|title=Moreover Joins LexisNexis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Moreover became involved with developing the [[RSS|Really Simple Syndication]] (RSS) 1.0 standard in 2000&lt;ref&gt;RSS-DEV Working Group, 9 December 2000. [http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/spec "RDF Site Summary (RSS) 1.0"]&lt;/ref&gt; and was later acquired by [[VeriSign]] in 2005 for $30m.&lt;ref&gt;The Register, 18 October 2005. [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/10/18/verisign_buys_moreover/ "VeriSign aggregates Moreover"]&lt;/ref&gt; As part of VeriSign the Moreover business unit was renamed as Real-Time Publisher Services being paired with [[Weblogs.com]] to create a platform for publishers and bloggers to track and distribute content. In May 2009 Moreover was sold to a private investor group led by Paul Farrell.&lt;ref&gt;Moreover Company Blog, 13 May 2009. [http://blog.moreover.com/2009/05/13/moreover-3-0-we-divest-out-of-verisign/ "Moreover 3.0: We divest out of VeriSign"]&lt;/ref&gt; The sale included Weblogs.com with the [[ping blog|ping server]] becoming wholly owned and run by Moreover.

== Currently ==
Moreover currently powers the [[Ask.com]] News Search&lt;ref&gt;PR Newswire, 22 July 2002.

In [[New Zealand]] [[economics]], '''onshore and offshore services''' are respectively [[service (economics)|services]] provided within New Zealand to foreigners and services provided outside New Zealand to New Zealanders.

==Onshore services==

The best example of an onshore service is tourism. For example, if an American resident were to travel to New Zealand, and play golf with his friends in [[Auckland]], the provision of golfing facilities would be classified as an onshore service as the Auckland (New Zealand) golf club is providing the American tourist with a service.

==Offshore services==

New Zealand is heavily reliant on overseas providers for insurance services and for transport for goods via sea. For instance, if a New Zealand tourist flies [[Virgin Atlantic Airways|Virgin Airlines]] from Ireland to London, this tourist has used a service, not provided by his own country, to travel from one place to another.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9486">In law, '''perfection''' relates to the additional steps required to be taken in relation to a [[security interest]] in order to make it effective against third parties&lt;ref&gt;See generally "Perfection of security interest," Black's Law Dictionary, pp. 1023-1023 (5th ed. 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; or to retain its effectiveness in the event of default by the grantor of the security interest.  Generally speaking, once a security interest is effectively created, it gives certain rights to the holder of the security and imposes duties on the party who grants that security.&lt;ref&gt;''Mace Builders v Lunn'' [1987] Ch 191&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in many legal systems, additional steps --- perfection of the security interest --- are required to enforce the security against third parties such as a [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, section 395 of the Companies Act 1986 of the United Kingdom requires certain security interests to be filed at [[Companies House]] within 21 days of being created.  A failure to make such a filing does not affect the validity of the security interest between the debtor and the secured party, but if the debtor goes into insolvent liquidation, the security interest is [[void (law)|void]] against the liquidator.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==

As a legal concept, perfection must be distinguished from:
*the ''grant'' or ''creation'' of the security interest, which creates its primary validity;
*''attachment'', which are steps that link the security interest to the underlying asset; and,
*''priority'', which is an ordering of competing security interests in same asset.

The same rule --- the [[common law]] [[rule in Dearle v Hall|rule in ''Dearle v Hall'']], for instance --- may govern both perfection against third parties (e.g., subsequent security holders) and prioritization of competing security interests.

In most legal systems, the need for perfection arises only in relation to security interests that are proprietary in nature (such as a [[mortgage law|mortgage]] or [[equitable charge]]).  Other arrangements which constitute security in the loose sense of the word --- for instance, [[retention of title clause|title retention arrangements]], [[hire purchase]], and [[lease|leasing transactions]] --- need not in general be perfected in the legal sense.

In India, Section 125 of the Companies Act, 1956 provides that certain charges shall be void against liquidator or creditors unless registered. Thus,if a charge is not registered with Registrar of Companies, and company happens to go for liquidation, even secured creditor shall be treated as unsecured.

==Types of perfection==

There are three principal modes by which a security interest may be perfected (which method of perfection is applicable depends upon the nature of the security interest and the laws of the relevant country).

# possession of the [[collateral (finance)|collateral]];
# statutory registration or filing;&lt;ref&gt;Such as the filing under section 395 of the United Kingdom Companies Act 1986 referred to above&lt;/ref&gt; and
# notice to the debtor or a fundholder.

===Possession===

Some security interests can be perfected only by the actual possession of the asset.  For example, under a  common-law [[Pledge (law)|pledge]] (or pawn), the right to enforce the sale of the asset is contingent upon the possession of that asset: an agreement that leaves the debtor in possession of the pledged collateral does not give rise to an enforceable security interest.&lt;ref&gt;''Dublin City Distilery Co Ltd v Doherty'' [1914] AC 823&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain cases, the possession does not need to be ''actual'' possession, but may be ''constructive'' possession.  For example, possession of a document of title will often suffice where it is not possible to possess the goods.&lt;ref&gt;Although see ''Official Assignee of Madras v Mercantile Bank of India'' [1935] AC 53 where Lord Wright inferred that this may not be the case, discussed and explained in other terms in ''Commercial Law'' by [[Roy Goode]].&lt;/ref&gt;  In many legal systems, there may also be constructive possession by [[attornment]].

The law relating to perfection of security interests by taking of possession can sometimes be confused with the law relating to the granting of security interests, which provides that the deposit of certain assets (usually documents of title) can amount to an equitable mortgage of the goods.&lt;ref&gt;For a recent example an equitable mortgage created this way in Australia, see {{cite AustLII|HCA|45|2005|litigants=Theodore v Mistford Pty Ltd |courtname=auto |parralelcite=(2005) 221 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 612 |date=1 September 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Registration or filing===

Certain security interests may be perfected by some kind of registration or filing.  Although the terms are used interchangeably, it is more accurate to speak of registration as the lodgment of particulars, and filing as the lodgment of the security instrument itself.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Committee on Consumer Credit (Cmnd. 4596, 1971), para 5.7.13; the distinction does have some meaning, as registration of particulars only makes third parties aware that there is a security interest, whereas filing they can see the terms of the security interest.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally systems of registration divide into two types:
# registration against a particular debtor; and
# registration against a particular asset.
Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.

Registration against a particular asset only tends to be practical where the assets are of a nature and substance that makes it feasible to have a register for recording security interests against them.  Most countries have systems for the registration of security relating to land, aircraft, ships and intellectual property rights.  The advantage of a register relating to the asset is that if the debtor wishes to provide an asset as collateral, the proposed lender can swiftly check definitively whether the asset is encumbered or not. Nevertheless, specialist registers in some jurisdictions cannot always be considered "a one-stop source of information".&lt;ref&gt;For an analysis of the uncertainties surrounding Intellectual property registers in the UK see Andrea Tosato, Security interests over intellectual property  (2011) Journal of intellectual property law and Practice 99 [http://jiplp.oxfordjournals.org/content/6/2/93.short?rss=1][http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2073301]&lt;/ref&gt;

Registration against a debtor tends to operate by way of requiring the registration of certain security interests by the debtor.  The advantage is that a lender can quickly see which assets of the debtor are encumbered and which are not.  However, because many registration systems do not require all types of security interest to be registered gaps can remain.  Also, systems which register security against the debtor do not act as a check that the debtor actually has title to any of the relevant assets, merely that he has not created any security interest over them.&lt;ref&gt;A lender can still be in difficulty if it transpires that the goods are subject to a lease, or retention of title arrangement, or other form of non-registrable arrangement.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the position is complicated by the fact that many legal systems employ both, interchangeably.  A security interest granted by a debtor over a particular asset in any given country may need to be registered against the debtor, against the asset, both or neither.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the [[United Kingdom]] if a [[company (law)|company]] was to grant a mortgage over land and its rental income, this would be registrable both against the company (under section 395 of the Companies Act) and the asset (under the Land Registration Act and/or the Land Charges Act), but the same company granting a fixed equitable charge over a car would not be required to register it anywhere.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notice ===

In some legal systems, perfection of a security interest requires notice to be given to a relevant third party.  This most commonly arises in relation to security over a debt or other ''[[Chose (English law)|chose in action]]'', notice being required to be given to the party owing the debt or holding the fund.  Under English law, an often cited example is the well-known [[rule in Dearle v Hall|rule in ''Dearle v Hall'']].  Under the rule if A is owed money by X, and then A grants an [[equitable charge]] over that debt to B, and then grants a second equitable charge over the same debt to C, then the ability to enforce the charge by either B or C against the money in X's hands is dependent upon the giving of notice to X.  The controversy in the rule relates to the fact that it is also a rule of ''priority'', meaning that (if their rights are otherwise equal) the first one to give notice to X has the prior claim, irrespective of the order in which the equitable charges were granted.

Similarly, in many common law legal systems, where there is an [[assignment (law)|assignment]] of a debt, the assignee cannot enforce the rights of the assigning creditor against the debtor unless notice of the assignment has been given, and until notice of the assignment has been given, the debtor can still discharge the debt by paying the money to the creditor, notwithstanding the assignment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6075">A  '''real estate entrepreneur''' or a '''real estate investor''' to a lesser extent is someone who actively or passively [[investment|invests]] in [[real estate]].  An active investor may buy a [[real property|property]], make repairs and/or improvements to the property, and sell it later for a profit.   A passive investor might hire a real estate firm to find and manage an investment property for him.   Typically, investors choose [[real estate]] for several reasons: [[cash flow]], [[capital appreciation]], [[depreciation]], [[tax]] benefits and [[leverage (finance)|leverage]].

Appreciation occurs over time, generally, though an investor may "force the [[ownership equity|equity]]" in a property by making enhancements to it or the surrounding environment to increase its value.  In general, [[residential]] real estate is valued by the "comparable sales" method which estimates the value of property under the principle of [[substitute good|substitution]].  The method estimates property values by comparing a subject property to similar properties sold in similar locations within a recent period of time.

[[Depreciation]] is one of the many benefits afforded to real estate investors. Though the property is actually increasing in value, the government allows owners to systematically depreciate the property over its projected useful life span.  Depreciation is an allowable [[tax deduction]].  In addition to depreciation, an investor will usually claim the [[interest]] portion of his monthly mortgage payment as a tax deduction.

[[Leverage (finance)|Leverage]] is a powerful reason for investing in real estate.  If an investor used 100% cash to acquire a house worth $100,000, and the house increased in value by $5,000 in one year, then the investor made a return of 5% (assuming no other costs in this case).  However, if the investor obtained 95% financing, only $5,000 cash would be required at the closing table, and a [[bank]] or other lender would loan the remaining $95,000 to acquire the property.

Assuming the same $5,000 increase in value, the investor's cash contribution of $5,000 would yield an increase in equity of $5,000 in one year, a 100% return. Leverage works in the opposite manner as well. A $1,000 decrease in value would produce a negative 20% return on the $5,000 investment.

[[Real estate investing]] has become quite popular in recent years due to rising property values and low [[interest rate]]s. However, [[Deflation]] in property values or a sharp increase in interest rates would dampen the [[Market (economics)|market]] considerably.

[[File:SWOT en.svg|thumb|A SWOT analysis, with its four elements in a 2×2 matrix.]]
'''SWOT analysis''' (or '''SWOT matrix''') is a strategic planning technique used to help a person or organization identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to  [[business]] competition or project planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SWOT Analysis: Discover New Opportunities, Manage and Eliminate Threats|url=http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_05.htm|accessdate=24 February 2018|language=en|date=1006|website=www.mindtools.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended to specify the objectives of the business venture or project and identify the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable to achieving those objectives. Users of a SWOT analysis often ask and answer questions to generate meaningful information for each category to make the tool useful and identify their competitive advantage. SWOT has been described as the tried-and-true tool of strategic analysis.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strategic Management|last=Dess|first=Gregory|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2018|isbn=9781259927621|location=United States|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Strengths and weakness are frequently internally-related, while opportunities and threats commonly focus on the external environment. The name is an acronym for the four parameters the technique examines:
* '''''S'''trengths'': characteristics of the business or project that give it an advantage over others.
* '''''W'''eaknesses'': characteristics of the business that place the business or project at a disadvantage relative to others.
* '''''O'''pportunities'': elements in the environment that the business or project could exploit to its advantage.
* '''''T'''hreats'':  elements in the environment that could cause trouble for the business or project.
The degree to which the internal environment of the firm matches with the external environment is expressed by the concept of [[strategic fit]]. Identification of SWOTs is important because they can inform later steps in planning to achieve the objective. First, decision-makers should consider whether the objective is attainable, given the SWOTs. If the objective is ''not'' attainable, they must select a different objective and repeat the process.

Some authors credit SWOT to [[Albert S. Humphrey|Albert Humphrey]], who led a convention at the Stanford Research Institute (now [[SRI International]]) in the 1960s and 1970s using data from [[Fortune 500]] companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sri.com/sites/default/files/brochures/dec-05.pdf|title=SWOT Analysis for Management Consulting|last=Humphrey|first=Albert|date=December 2005|work=SRI Alumni Newsletter|publisher=[[SRI International]]|authorlink=Albert S. Humphrey}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tamplc.com/Humphsprofile.htm|title=Albert Humphrey The "Father" of TAM|publisher=TAM UK|accessdate=2012-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Humphrey himself did not claim the creation of SWOT, and the origins remain obscure.

== Internal and external factors ==
SWOT analysis aims to identify the key internal and external factors seen as important to achieving an objective. SWOT analysis groups key pieces of information into two main categories:

# Internal factors — the ''strengths'' and ''weaknesses'' internal to the organization
# External factors — the ''opportunities'' and ''threats'' presented by the environment external to the organization

Analysis may view the internal factors as strengths or as weaknesses depending upon their effect on the organization's objectives.  What may represent strengths with respect to one objective may be weaknesses (distractions, competition) for another objective.  The factors may include all of the [[marketing mix|4Ps]] as well as [[personnel]], [[finance]], [[manufacturing]] capabilities, and so on.

The external factors may include [[macroeconomic]] matters, [[technological change]], [[legislation]], and sociocultural changes, as well as changes in the marketplace or in competitive position.  The results are often presented in the form of a [[Table (information)|matrix]].

SWOT analysis is just one method of [[categorization]] and has its own weaknesses. For example, it may tend to persuade its users to compile lists rather than to think about actual important factors in achieving objectives. It also presents the resulting lists uncritically and without clear prioritization so that, for example, weak opportunities may appear to balance strong threats.

It is prudent not to eliminate any candidate SWOT entry too quickly. The importance of individual SWOTs will be revealed by the value of the strategies they generate.  A SWOT item that produces valuable strategies is important.  A SWOT item that generates no strategies is not important.

== Use ==
The usefulness of SWOT analysis is not limited to [[For-profit corporation|profit-seeking organizations]].  SWOT analysis may be used in any decision-making situation when a desired end-state (objective) is defined.  Examples include [[non-profit organizations]], governmental units, and individuals. SWOT analysis may also be used in pre-crisis planning and preventive [[crisis management]]. SWOT analysis may also be used in creating a recommendation during a [[viability study]]/survey.

=== Strategy building ===
SWOT analysis can be used effectively to build organizational or personal strategy.  Steps necessary to execute strategy-oriented analysis involve identification of internal and external factors (using the popular 2x2 matrix), selection and evaluation of the most important factors, and identification of relations existing between internal and external features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Blake |first1=Martin |last2=Wijetilaka |first2=Shehan |date=26 February 2015 |title=5 tips to grow your start-up using SWOT analysis |url=http://www.brw.com.au/p/entrepreneurs/tips_to_grow_your_start_up_using_eQEF8Pm8l2Q9hME9TBXvVL |location=Sydney |access-date=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, strong relations between strengths and opportunities can suggest good conditions in the company and allow using an ''aggressive'' strategy. On the other hand, strong interactions between weaknesses and threats could be analyzed as a potential warning and advice for using a ''defensive'' strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Osita |first=Christian |last2=Onyebuchi |first2=Idoko |last3=Justina |first3=Nzekwe |date=31 January 2014 |title=Organization's stability and productivity: the role of SWOT analysis |url=http://journalijiar.com/uploads/2014-10-02_231409_710.pdf |publisher=International Journal of Innovative and Applied Research (2014) |volume=2 |issue=9 |pages=23–32 |access-date=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Matching and converting ===
One way of using SWOT is matching and converting. Matching is used to find [[competitive advantage]] by matching the strengths to opportunities. Another tactic is to convert weaknesses or threats into strengths or opportunities. An example of a conversion strategy is to find new markets. If the threats or weaknesses cannot be converted, a company should try to minimize or avoid them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shsu.edu/~mkt_ssm/mkt570/Chap04.ppt See for instance: Mehta, S. (2000) ''Marketing Strategy'']&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corporate planning ===
As part of the development of strategies and plans to enable the organization to achieve its objectives, that organization will use a systematic/rigorous process known as [[corporate planning]]. SWOT alongside [[PEST analysis|PEST]]/[[PESTLE]] can be used as a basis for the analysis of business and environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong. M. A handbook of Human Resource Management Practice (10th edition) 2006, Kogan Page, London {{ISBN|0-7494-4631-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Set objectives — defining what the organization is going to do
* Environmental scanning
** Internal appraisals of the organization's SWOT — this needs to include an assessment of the present situation as well as a portfolio of products/services and an analysis of the product/service lifecycle
* Analysis of existing strategies — this should determine relevance from the results of an internal/external appraisal. This may include [[gap analysis]] of environmental factors
* Strategic Issues defined — key factors in the development of a corporate plan that the organization must address
* Develop new/revised strategies — revised analysis of strategic issues may mean the objectives need to change
* Establish [[critical success factor]]s — the achievement of objectives and strategy implementation
* Preparation of operational, resource, projects plans for strategy implementation
* Monitoring all results — mapping against plans, taking corrective action, which may mean amending objectives/strategies&lt;ref name=arms&gt;Armstrong.M  Management Processes and Functions, 1996, London CIPD  {{ISBN|0-85292-438-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marketing ===
{{Main|Marketing management}}
In many competitor analysis, marketers build detailed profiles of each competitor in the market, focusing especially on their relative competitive strengths and weaknesses using SWOT analysis. Marketing managers will examine each competitor's cost structure, sources of profits, resources and competencies, competitive positioning and product differentiation, degree of [[vertical integration]], historical responses to industry developments, and other factors.

Marketing management often finds it necessary to invest in research to collect the data required to perform accurate marketing analysis. Accordingly, management often conducts market research (alternately marketing research) to obtain this information. Marketers employ a variety of techniques to conduct market research, but some of the more common include:
* Qualitative marketing research such as focus groups
* Quantitative marketing research such as statistical surveys
* Experimental techniques such as test markets
* Observational techniques such as ethnographic (on-site) observation
* Marketing managers may also design and oversee various environmental scanning and competitive intelligence processes to help identify trends and inform the company's marketing analysis.

== In community organization ==
The SWOT analysis has been used in community work as a tool to identify positive and negative factors within organizations, communities, and the broader society that promote or inhibit successful implementation of social services and social change efforts.&lt;ref name="community tool box"&gt;{{cite web |title=Community Toolbox: Section 14. SWOT analysis |url=http://ctb.ku.edu/en/table-of-contents/assessment/assessing-community-needs-and-resources/swot-analysis/main |accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used as a preliminary resource, assessing strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in a community served by a nonprofit or community organization.&lt;ref name="social work" /&gt; This organizing tool is best used in collaboration with community workers and/or community members before developing goals and objectives for a program design or implementing an organizing strategy. The SWOT analysis is a part of the planning for social change process and will not provide a strategic plan if used by itself.  After a SWOT analysis is completed, a social change organization can turn the SWOT list into a series of recommendations to consider before developing a strategic plan.&lt;ref name="our community"&gt;{{cite web |title=Our Community |url=https://www.ourcommunity.com.au/boards/boards_article.jsp?articleId=1369 |accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Physical resources — your location, building, equipment
* Financial — grants, funding agencies, other sources of income
* Activities and processes — programs you run, systems you employ
* Past experiences — building blocks for learning and success, your reputation in the community

'''Opportunities and threats''' (''external factors stemming from community or societal forces''):&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;
* Future trends in your field or the culture
* The economy — local, national, or international
* Funding sources — foundations, donors, legislatures

Although the SWOT analysis was originally designed as an organizational method for business and industries, it has been replicated in various community work as a tool for identifying external and internal support to combat internal and external opposition.&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt; The SWOT analysis is necessary to provide direction to the next stages of the change process.&lt;ref name=BOOK&gt;{{cite book |last=Birkenmaier |first=Julie |title=The Practice of Generalist Social Work |year=2001 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used by community organizers and community members to further social justice in the context of Social Work practice.

=== Application in community organization ===

As mentioned [[SWOT analysis#top|above]], SWOT can be crucial to determining the success of a project, while factoring in funding, as well as accessibility and logic. Often, a city will spend a year weighing the [[Risk-benefit]]s&lt;ref&gt;[[Pittsburg, California]] tried this out recently with the BART program. Citation: (Document). Pittsburg City, California, www.ci.pittsburg.ca.us/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Urban Analysis of Urmia, Iran |url=http://rrrs.reviste.ubbcluj.ro/arhive/Artpdf/v10n22014/RRRS10220145.pdf |website=Reviste}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a project before they even vote on it.
==== Elements to consider ====
Elements to consider in a SWOT analysis include understanding the community that a particular organization is working with. This can be done via public forums, listening campaigns, and informational interviews. Data collection will help inform the community members and workers when developing the SWOT analysis. A needs and assets assessment is tooling that can be used to identify the needs and existing resources of the community. When these assessments are done and data has been collected, an analysis of the community can be made that informs the SWOT analysis.&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;

==== Steps for implementation ====
A SWOT analysis is best developed in a group setting such as a work or community meeting. A facilitator can conduct the meeting by first explaining what a SWOT analysis is as well as identifying the meaning of each term.&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;

One way of facilitating the development of a SWOT analysis includes developing an example SWOT with the larger group then separating each group into smaller teams to present to the larger group after set amount of time.&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt; This allows for individuals, who may be silenced in a larger group setting, to contribute. Once the allotted time is up, the facilitator may record all the factors of each group onto a large document such as a poster board, and then the large group,  as a collective, can go work through each of the threats and weaknesses to explore options that may be used to combat negative forces with the strengths and opportunities present within the organization and community.&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt; A SWOT meeting allows  participants to creatively brainstorm, identify obstacles, and possibly strategize solutions/way forward to these limitations.

==== When to use SWOT analysis ====
The uses of a SWOT analysis by a community organization are as follows: to   organize information, provide insight into barriers&lt;ref name="use and misuse"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chermack |first=Thomas J. |author2=Bernadette K. Kasshanna |title=The Use of and Misuse of SWOT analysis and implications for HRD professionals |journal=Human Resource Development International |date=December 2007 |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=383–399}}&lt;/ref&gt;  that may be present while engaging in social change processes, and identify strengths available that can be activated to counteract these barriers.

''A SWOT analysis can be used to:''
* Explore new solutions to problems &lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;
* Identify barriers that will limit goals/objectives &lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;
* Decide on direction that will be most effective &lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;
* Reveal possibilities and limitations for change&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;
* To revise plans to best navigate systems, communities, and organizations
* As a brainstorming and recording device as a means of communication&lt;ref name="use and misuse" /&gt;
* To enhance "credibility of interpretation" to be used in presentation to leaders or key supporters.&lt;ref name="social work"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Westhues |first=Anne |author2=Jean Lafrance |author3=Glen Schmidt |title=A SWOT analysis of social work education in Canada |journal=Social Work Education: The International Journal |year=2001 |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=35–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefits and advantages ===
The SWOT analysis in social work practice framework is beneficial because it helps organizations decide whether or not an objective is obtainable and therefore enables organizations to set achievable goals, objectives, and steps to further the social change or community development effort.&lt;ref name=benefits&gt;{{cite web |last=Quincy |first=Ronald |title=SWOT Analysis: Raising capacity of your organization |url=http://socialwork.rutgers.edu/Libraries/Huamin/Brochure_2.sflb |publisher=Rutgers School of Social Work |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417010302/http://socialwork.rutgers.edu/libraries/huamin/brochure_2.sflb |archivedate=2016-04-17 |accessdate=2013-02-25 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It enables organizers to take visions and produce practical and efficient outcomes that effect long-lasting change, and it helps organizations gather meaningful information to maximize their potential.&lt;ref name="benefits" /&gt; Completing a SWOT analysis is a useful process regarding the consideration of key organizational priorities, such as gender and cultural diversity and fundraising objectives.&lt;ref name="change agency"&gt;{{cite web |title=Campaigners Toolkit: Strategy |publisher=The Change Agency |url=http://www.thechangeagency.org/campaigners-toolkit/training-resources/strategy/ |accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==
Some findings from Menon et al. (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Menon, A. |title=Antecedents and Consequences of Marketing Strategy Making |journal=Journal of Marketing |volume=63 |pages=18–40 |year=1999 |doi=10.2307/1251943 |jstor=1251943 |issue=2 |publisher=American Marketing Association |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hill and Westbrook (1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hill, T. &amp; R. Westbrook |title=SWOT Analysis: It’s Time for a Product Recall |journal=Long Range Planning |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=46–52 |year=1997 |doi=10.1016/S0024-6301(96)00095-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that SWOT may harm performance and that "no-one subsequently used the outputs within the later stages of the strategy". 

Other critiques include the misuse of the SWOT analysis as a technique that can be quickly designed without critical thought leading to a misrepresentation of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats within an organization's internal and external surroundings.&lt;ref name="SWOT does not need to be recalled"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koch |first=Adam |title=SWOT does not need to be recalled: It needs to be enhanced |journal=Swineburne University of Technology |year=2000 |url=http://www.westga.edu/~bquest/2000/swot1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a firm becomes preoccupied with a single strength, such as cost control, they can neglect their weaknesses, such as product quality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another limitation includes the development of a SWOT analysis simply to defend previously decided goals and objectives. This misuse leads to limitations on brainstorming possibilities and "real" identification of barriers. This misuse also places the organization’s interest above the well-being of the community. Further, a SWOT analysis should be developed as a collaborative with a variety of contributions made by participants including community members. The design of a SWOT analysis by one or two community workers is limiting to the realities of the forces, specifically external factors, and devalues the possible contributions of community members.&lt;ref name="use and misuse" /&gt;

Overall, managers should remember that SWOT is a starting point for discussion and cannot, in itself, show managers how to achieve a competitive advantage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because the SWOT analysis is a snapshot of the firm at a particular moment in time, the analysis might obscure the fact that both the internal and external environment are rapidly changing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== The SVOR alternative ==

In project management, the alternative to SWOT known by the acronym SVOR (Strengths, Vulnerabilities, Opportunities, and Risks) compares the project elements along two axes: internal and external, and positive and negative. It takes into account the mathematical link that exists between these various elements, considering also the role of infrastructures. The SVOR table provides an intricate understanding of the elements at play in a given project:&lt;ref&gt;Mesly, Olivier (2017). ''Project feasibility – Tools for uncovering points of vulnerability.'' New York, NY:Taylor and Francis, CRC Press, 546 pages,  9 {{ISBN|9781498757911}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Constraints consist of: calendar of tasks and activities, costs, and norms of quality. The "''k''" constant varies with each project (for example, it may be valued at 1.3).{{cn|date=February 2018}}{{efn|Best source I could find is https://ceopedia.org/index.php/SWOT_analysis but seems unrelated.}}

== SWOT analysis in popular culture ==
=== Ads ===
Many reports have been published about the use of SWOT by real life companies, and how the idea is spreading.{{which|date=October 2018}} [[Coca-Cola (company)|Coca-Cola]] has used this in their television ads&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valueline.com/Stocks/Highlights/The_Coca-Cola_Company__A_Short_SWOT_Analysis.aspx#.Wo36ULeov4g|title=Value Line - The Most Trusted Name in Investment Research|publisher=Value Line Publishing|website=www.valueline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to effectively target a customer, such as appeal to senses.

=== Television shows ===
In the ''[[Silicon Valley (TV series)|Silicon Valley]]'' episode "Homicide" (Season 2, Episode 6), Jared Dunn ([[Zach Woods]]) introduces the Pied Piper team to SWOT analysis. Later in that episode Dinesh ([[Kumail Nanjiani]]) and Gilfoyle ([[Martin Starr]]) employ the method when deciding whether or not to inform a stunt driver that the calculations for his upcoming jump were performed incorrectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website|url=https://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley/season-02/6-homicide/synopsis|website=HBO|title=Synopsis: ''Silicon Valley'' - 'Homicide'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sales''' are activities related to selling or the number of goods or services sold in a given time period.

The ''seller'' or the provider of the [[Goods and services|goods or services]] complete a sale in response to an [[takeover|acquisition]], [[appropriation (economics)|appropriation]],&lt;ref&gt;Part III, effects of the contract, Rule 5. ''Sale of Goods Act 1979''. [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[purchase order|requisition]] or a direct interaction with the ''buyer'' at the [[point of sale]]. There is a passing of title (property or ownership) of the [[Commodity|item]], and the settlement of a [[price]], in which agreement is reached on a price for which transfer of ownership of the item will occur. The ''seller'', not the [[Purchasing|purchaser]] generally executes the sale and it may be completed prior to the obligation of [[payment]]. In the case of indirect interaction, a person who sells goods or service on behalf of the owner is known as a '''salesman''' or '''saleswoman''' or '''salesperson''', but this often refers to someone selling goods in a store/shop, in which case other terms are also common, including ''[[salesclerk]]'', ''shop assistant'', and ''retail clerk''.

In common law countries, sales are governed generally by the [[common law]] and [[commercial code (law)|commercial code]]s. In the [[United States]], the laws governing sales of goods are somewhat uniform to the extent that most jurisdictions have [[Uniform Commercial Code adoption|adopted]] Article 2 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]], albeit with some non-uniform variations.

==Definition==
A person or organization expressing an interest in acquiring the offered item of value is referred to as a potential buyer, prospective customer or prospect.  Buying and selling are understood to be two sides of the same "coin" or transaction. Both seller and buyer engage in a process of negotiation to consummate the exchange of values. The exchange, or selling, process has implied rules and identifiable stages. It is implied that the selling process will proceed fairly and ethically so that the parties end up nearly equally rewarded. The stages of selling, and buying, involve getting acquainted, assessing each party's need for the other's item of value, and determining if the values to be exchanged are equivalent or nearly so, or, in buyer's terms, "worth the price". Sometimes, sellers have to use their own experiences when selling products with appropriate discounts.&lt;ref name=seller&gt;{{cite journal |title=Buyer Success and Failure in Bargaining and Its Consequences |first=C. |last=Putthiwanit |first2=S.-H. |last2=Ho |journal=Australian Journal of Business and Management Research  |volume=1 |issue=5 |year=2011 |pages=83–92 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a management viewpoint it is thought of as a part of [[marketing]],&lt;ref&gt;Philip Kotler, ''Principles of Marketing,'' Prentice -Hall, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; although the skills required are different. Sales often form a separate grouping in a corporate structure, employing separate specialist operatives known as ''salespersons'' (singular: ''salesperson''). Selling is considered by many to be a sort of [[persuasion|persuad]]ing "art". Contrary to popular belief, the methodological approach of selling refers to a ''systematic process of repetitive and measurable milestones, by which a salesman relates his or her offering of a product or service in return enabling the buyer to achieve their goal in an economic way''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |last=Greening |first=Jack |title=Selling Without Confrontation |publisher= The Haworth Press, Inc. |year=1993 |pages=23 |isbn=1-56024-326-0 }} Page image [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1560243260&amp;id=O8y4P3tGcEIC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;ots=FBSfQrSxig&amp;dq=methodical+sales+approach&amp;sig=gYaUSDYLWTuMBe_KFzfFOoEYdEY]&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2018 survey of salespeople, selling has become more difficult in recent years due to changes in technology and general access to prospects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marcwayshak.com/sales-statistics/|title=18 Sales Statistics You Need to Know About Right Now! [INFOGRAPHIC]|work=Sales Speaker Marc Wayshak|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[sales process]] refers to a systematic process of repetitive and measurable milestones, the definition of the selling is somewhat ambiguous due to the close nature of [[advertising]], [[Promotion (marketing)|promotion]], [[public relations]], and [[direct marketing]].

Selling is the profession-wide term, much like [[marketing]] defines a profession. Recently, attempts have been made to clearly understand who is in the sales profession, and who is not. There are many articles looking at [[marketing]], [[advertising]], [[Promotion (marketing)|promotion]]s, and even [[public relations]] as ways to create a unique [[Financial transaction|transaction]].

Two common terms used to describe a salesperson are "Farmer" and "Hunter". The reality is that most professional salespeople have a little of both. A hunter is often associated with aggressive personalities who use aggressive sales technique. In terms of sales methodology, a hunter refers to a person whose focus is on bringing in and closing deals. This process is called "sales capturing". An example is a commodity sale such as a long distance salesperson, shoe salesperson and to a degree a car salesperson. Their job is to find and convert buyers. A sales farmer is someone who creates sales demand through activities that directly influence and alter the buying process.

Many believe that the focus of selling is on the human agents involved in the exchange between buyer and seller. Effective selling also requires a [[Systems thinking|systems approach]], at minimum involving roles that sell, enable selling, and develop sales capabilities.  Selling also involves [[salesperson|salespeople]] who possess a specific set of [[selling method|sales skills]] and the knowledge required to facilitate the exchange of value between buyers and sellers that is unique from marketing, advertising, etc.

Within these three tenets, the following definition of professional selling is offered by the [[American Society for Training and Development]] (ASTD):
{{cquote|The holistic business system required to effectively develop, manage, enable, and execute a mutually beneficial, interpersonal exchange of goods or services for equitable value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=American Society for Training and Development (ASTD) | work=Sales Competency Project | url=http://www.astd.org/sdp | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921095003/http://www.astd.org/sdp | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2008-09-21 | date= | accessdate=2017-03-07 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Team selling]] is one way to influence sales. Team selling is "a group of people representing the sales department and other functional areas in the firm, such as finance, production, and research and development". (Spiro) Team selling came about in the 1990s through [[total quality management]] (TQM). TQM occurs when companies work to improve their customer satisfaction by constantly improving all of their operations.

=== Relationships with marketing ===
{{Marketing}}
[[Marketing]] and sales differ greatly but generally have the same goal. Selling is the final stage in marketing which puts the plan into effect, which also includes pricing, promotion, place, and product (the 4 P's). A marketing department in an organization has the goals of increasing the desirability and value to the customer and increasing the number and engagement of interactions between potential customers and the organization. Achieving this goal may involve the sales team using promotional techniques such as [[advertising]], [[sales promotion]], [[publicity]], and [[public relations]], creating new [[sales channels]], or creating new products ([[new product development]]), among other things. It can also include bringing the potential customer to visit the organization's website(s) for more information, or to contact the organization for more information, or to interact with the organization via social media such as [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]] and [[blog]]s. Social values also play a major role in consumer decision processes. Marketing is the whole of the work on persuasion made for the whole of the target people. Sales are the persuasion and effort that from one person to one person (B2C), one person makes to the corporation (B2B) in the face or in the phone or in the digital environment, to make a living resource enter the company.

The field of [[sales process engineering]] views "sales" as the output of a larger system, not just as the output of one department. The larger system includes many functional areas within an organization. From this perspective, "sales" and "marketing" (among others, such as "[[customer service]]") label for a number of processes whose inputs and outputs supply one another to varying degrees. In this context, improving an "output" (such as sales) involves studying and improving the broader sales process, as in any system, since the component functional areas interact and are interdependent.&lt;ref name="Selden"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Paul H. Selden|date=December 1998|title=Sales Process Engineering: An Emerging Quality Application|journal=Quality Progress| pages = 59–63}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Many large corporations structure their marketing departments so they are directly integrated with all lines of business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How To Organize Your Marketing Department In The Digital Age|url = http://www.cmo.com/articles/2015/2/12/organizing-for-digital-cwtk.html|website = www.cmo.com|access-date = 2016-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; They create multiple teams with a singular focus and the managers of these teams must coordinate efforts in order to drive profits and business success. For example, an "inbound" focused campaign seeks to drive more customers "through the door", giving the sales department a better chance of selling their product to the consumer. A good marketing program would address any potential downsides as well.

The sales department would aim to improve the interaction between the customer and the sales facility or mechanism (example, website) or salesperson. As Sales is the forefront of any organization, this would always need to take place before any other business process may begin. Sales management would break down the selling process and then increase the effectiveness of the discrete processes as well as the interaction between processes. For example, in many out-bound sales environments, the typical process includes outbound calling, the sales pitch, handling objections, opportunity identification, and the close. Each step of the process has sales-related issues, skills, and training needs, as well as marketing solutions to improve each discrete step, as well as the whole process. In many cases becoming a salesperson is a default career as not many people aspire to be a salesman but rather fall into the job due to circumstances. It can be highly rewarding as you receive remuneration in the form of a salary and also commission.

One further common complication of marketing involves the inability to measure results for a lot of marketing initiatives. In essence, many marketing and advertising executives often lose sight of the objective of sales/revenue/profit, as they focus on establishing a creative/innovative program, without concern for the [[top line|top]] or [[bottom line]]s – a fundamental pitfall of marketing for marketing's sake.

Many companies find it challenging to get marketing and sales on the same page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ending The War Between Sales And Marketing|url=http://hbr.org/web/special-collections/insight/marketing-that-works/end-the-war-between-sales-and-marketing|website=hbr.org|publisher=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=16 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819125522/http://hbr.org/web/special-collections/insight/marketing-that-works/end-the-war-between-sales-and-marketing|archivedate=19 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two departments, although different in nature, handle very similar concepts and have to work together for sales to be successful. Building a good relationship between the two that encourages communication can be the key to success – even in a [[down economy]].

===Industrial marketing===
The idea that marketing can potentially eliminate the need for salespeople depends entirely on context.  For example, this may be possible in some [[business-to-consumer|B2C]] situations; however, for many [[business-to-business|B2B]] transactions (for example, those involving industrial organizations) this is mostly impossible.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Another dimension is the value of the goods being sold. [[Fast moving consumer goods|Fast-moving consumer-goods]] (FMCG) require no sales people at the [[point of sale]] to get them to jump off the supermarket shelf and into the customer's trolley. However, the purchase of large mining equipment worth millions of dollars will require a salesperson to manage the sales process – particularly in the face of competitors. [[Small and medium businesses]] selling such large ticket items to a geographically-disperse client base use [[manufacturers' representative]]s to provide this highly personal service while avoiding the large expense of a captive sales force.

===Sales and marketing alignment and integration===
Another area of discussion involves the need for alignment and integration of corporate sales and marketing functions. According to a report from the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) Council, only 40 percent of companies have formal programs, systems or processes in place to align and integrate the two critical functions.

Traditionally, these two functions, as referenced above, have operated separately, left in siloed areas of tactical responsibility. Glen Petersen's book ''The [[Profit maximization|Profit Maximization]] Paradox''&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; sees the changes in the competitive landscape between the 1950s and the time of writing as so dramatic that the complexity of choice, price, and opportunities for the customer forced this seemingly simple and integrated relationship between sales and marketing to change forever. Petersen goes on to highlight that salespeople spend approximately 40 percent of their time preparing customer-facing deliverables while leveraging less than 50 percent of the materials created by marketing, adding to perceptions that marketing is out of touch with the customer and that sales is resistant to [[messaging]] and [[Marketing strategy|strategy]].

=== Sales agents ===
Agents in the sales process can represent either of two parties in the sales process; for example:

# Sales broker, seller agency, seller agent, [[Manufacturers' representative|seller representative]]: This is a traditional role where the salesman represents a person or company on the selling end of a deal.
# Buyers broker or Buyer brokerage: This is where the salesman represents the consumer making the purchase. This is most often applied in large transactions.
# Disclosed dual agent: This is where the salesman represents both parties in the sale and acts as a [[Mediation|mediator]] for the transaction. The role of the salesman here is to oversee that both parties receive an honest and fair deal, and is responsible to both.
# Transaction broker: This is where the salesperson represents neither party but handles the transaction only. The seller owes no responsibility to either party getting a fair or honest deal, just that all of the papers are handled properly.
# Sales outsourcing involves direct branded representation where the sales representatives are recruited, hired, and managed by an external entity but hold quotas, represent themselves as the brand of the client, and report all activities (through their own [[sales management]] channels) back to the client. It is akin to a virtual extension of a sales force (see [[sales outsourcing]]).
# Sales managers aim to implement various sales strategies and management techniques in order to facilitate improved [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] and increased sales volume. They are also responsible for coordinating the sales and marketing department as well as oversight concerning the [[Justice|fair]] and [[honesty|honest]] execution of the sales process by their agents.
# Salesperson: The primary function of professional salespeople is to generate and close business resulting in revenue. The salesperson will accomplish their primary function through a variety of means including phone calls, email, social media, networking, and [[cold calling]].  The primary objective of the successful salesperson is to find the consumers to sell to.  Sales are often referred to as a "numbers game" because a general law of averages and pattern of successful closing of business will emerge through heightened sales activity. These activities include but are not limited to: locating prospects, fostering relationships with prospects, building trust with future clients, identifying and filling needs of consumers, and therefore turning prospective customers into actual ones. Many tools are used by successful salespeople, the most important of which is questioning which can be defined as a series of questions and resulting answers allowing the salesperson to understand a customer's goals and requirements relevant to the product.  The creation of value or [[perceived value]] is the result of taking the information gathered, analyzing the goals and needs of the prospective customer and leveraging the products or services the salesperson's firm represents or sells in a way that most effectively achieves the prospective client's goals or suits their needs.  Effective salespeople will package their offering and present their proposed solution in a way that leads the prospective customer to the conclusion that they acquire the solution, resulting in revenue and profit for the salesperson and the organization they represent.
# Internet Sales Professionals: These people are primarily responsible for ensuring immediate response to the leads generated via social media, website or email campaigns.

==={{anchord|Inside sales}} vs. {{anchord|outside sales}}===
In the United States, the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] defines outside sales representatives as "employees [who] sell their employer's products, services, or facilities to customers away from their employer's place(s) of business, in general, either at the customer's place of business or by selling door-to-door at the customer's home" while defining those who work "from the employer's location" as inside sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/elaws/esa/flsa/overtime/s1.htm |title=elaws - FLSA Overtime Security Advisor |publisher=[[United States Department of Labor]] |date= |accessdate=2011-05-25 |archivedate=2011-05-25 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ywTnhanX?url=http://www.dol.gov/elaws/esa/flsa/overtime/s1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside sales generally involves attempting to [[closing (sales)|close business]] primarily over the phone via [[telemarketing]], while outside sales (or "field" sales) will usually involve initial phone work to book sales calls at the potential buyer's location to attempt to close the deal in person. Some companies have an inside sales department that works with outside representatives and book their appointments for them. Inside sales sometimes refers to [[upselling]] to existing customers.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

'''Siviløkonom''' (literally "civil economist") is an [[academic degree]] issued within the field of [[business administration]] and a professional title in [[Norway]] (with corresponding titles in [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]], see below under "See also"), obtained after 3 to 5 years of studies. The title is protected and can only be used by persons having met certain qualifications as directed by the [[Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research]]. It is mainly offered by nine institutions after the completion of a [[Master of Science in Business Administration]].

Master of Science in Business Administration programs entitling the Siviløkonom in Norway are:
* [[Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences]] (HiOA) ([[Oslo]])
* [[Bodø Graduate School of Business]] ([[University of Nordland|UiN]]) ([[Bodø]])
* [[NHH|Norwegian School of Economics]] (NHH) ([[Bergen]])
* [[BI Norwegian Business School]] (BI) ([[Oslo]])
* [[Norwegian University of Life Sciences]] ([[Ås, Akershus|Ås]])
* [[Buskerud University College]] ([[Hønefoss]])
* [[Molde University College]] ([[Molde]])
* [[Trondheim Business School]] ([[Sør-Trøndelag University College|HiST]]) ([[Trondheim]])
* [[University of Agder]] ([[Kristiansand]])
* [[University of Stavanger]] ([[Stavanger]])
* [[University of Tromsø]] ([[Tromsø]])

Additionally, the title can be granted to candidates with foreign education meeting certain criteria, through application to the NHH. Due to changes in the Norwegian educational system, granting of the title based on foreign education will be phased out on 12/31/2008, and can through that date only be granted to persons who started their qualifying education prior to 1/1/2003.

==History==
Traditionally the siviløkonom degree was only offered at NHH in [[Bergen]], and was originally a two-year, then three-year program.  In 1975 it became a four-year business administration degree at the level equivalent to a [[cand.mag.]] degree. NHH had a monopoly on awarding the degree until 1985 when the Norwegian School of Management BI and the Bodø Graduate School of Business was allowed to offer the degree. After the [[Norwegian higher education quality reform|quality reform]] all institutions of higher education were allowed to issue the title to all master graduates, and the requirements for the degree increased from four to five years of study.

A '''sports agent''' is a legal representative (hence [[agent (law)|agent]]) for professional sports figures such as athletes and coaches. They procure and negotiate employment and [[Testimonial|endorsement]] contracts for the [[principal (commercial law)|athlete or coach]] whom they represent.
Because of the unique characteristics of the [[sports industry]], sports agents are responsible for communications with team owners, managers, and other individuals.  Also, they are responsible for making recommendations in regard . In addition to finding income sources, agents often handle [[public relations]] matters for their clients. In some large sports agencies, such as [[International Management Group|IMG]], [[Creative Artists Agency]], Roc Nation Sports and [[Octagon (Sports Agency)|Octagon]], agents deal with all aspects of a client's finances, from investment to filing taxes.

Sports agents may be relied upon by their clients for guidance in all business aspects, and sometimes even more broadly.  For example, hockey agents start recruiting clients as young as 15, allowing the agent to guide the athlete's career before the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] [[NHL Entry Draft|draft]], which happens usually at 18 years of age.

Due to the length and complexity of contracts, many sports agents are lawyers or have a background in contract law. Agents are expected to be knowledgeable about finance, business management, and financial and risk analysis, as well as sports. It is important for a sports agent to follow trends in sports. Other skills an agent must possess are excellent communication and negotiation skills. Agents must be highly motivated, willing to work long hours, and capable of multitasking. It is very common for agents to be in negotiations on behalf of several clients at one time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jobprofiles.org/artsportsagent.htm Job Profiles.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109035912/http://www.jobprofiles.org/artsportsagent.htm |date=2010-01-09 }} – description of roles of sports agent and some educational programs to prepare for the field&lt;/ref&gt;

Some agents are part of large companies, and some are on their own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsagentblog.com/2007/07/16/an-industry-of-conglomerates/ An Industry Of Conglomerates] Sports Agent Blog, July 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The number of clients an individual agent can handle and how many clients his or her employing agency can handle in total are interdependent variables.

Before the 1990s, most [[association football|football]] players did not use agents. In some cases, they used their fathers as agents. Because of most parents' naivete about the football business, these young footballers were often given less-than-stellar contracts by football clubs, which yielded lower salaries than they thought they deserved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article396507.ece?token=null&amp;offset=0&amp;page=1 "The Big Interview: Neil Webb"] ''Sunday Times'', Nov. 28, 2004, interview with soccer/football player&lt;/ref&gt; In Sweden, there were only three licensed agents in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sydsvenskan.se/sport/article18746/Marknaden-mattad-pa-agenter.html "Market Saturation of Agents"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810181903/http://www.sydsvenskan.se/sport/article18746/Marknaden-mattad-pa-agenter.html |date=2011-08-10 }}, May 23, 2002, note: source can be translated into English on the website&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2002, there were 33.  According to [[FIFA]], there were 5,187 licensed association football agents worldwide, with 600 agents in Italy alone.&lt;ref&gt;[ FIFA – Players' agents list – by country]&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2001, agents have not been licensed by FIFA. Instead, agents are now licensed directly by each association.

Sports agents generally receive between 4 and 10% of the athlete's playing contract, and 10 to 20% of the athlete's endorsement contract, although these figures vary. [[NFL]] agents are not permitted to receive more than 3%, and [[NBA]] agents not more than 4%, of their client's playing contracts.

==Media depictions==
The popularity of television shows such as ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]'', which stars a [[talent agent]] named [[Ari Gold (Entourage)|Ari Gold]], and ''[[Arliss]]'', have helped glamorize the profession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsagentblog.com/2008/12/04/so-you-want-to-be-an-agent-the-entourage-effect/ "So, You Want To Be An Agent? The Entourage Effect"] Sports Agent Blog, Dec. 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to that, movies such as ''[[Jerry Maguire]]'', ''[[Two for the Money (2005 film)|Two for the Money]]'', and ''[[Any Given Sunday]]'' depicted sports agents. In England, ITV's ''[[Footballers' Wives]]'' put a new spin on sports agents by casting a no-holds-barred female agent [[Hazel Bailey]]. The television show ''[[Ballers]]'', which started in 2015, also shows a strong depiction of sports agents.

Due to the popularity of these works, there has been increase of attention in the profession. Former Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]]'s son decided to become a football agent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/blairs-son-to-become-a-football-agent-1829864.html "Blair's son to become a football agent"] Nov. 28, 2009, ''The Independent''&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''teal organisation''' is an emerging organisational [[paradigm]] that advocates a level of [[consciousness]] including all previous [[world view]]s within the operations of an [[organization|organisation]]. The concept of teal organisation refers to the next stage in the evolution of [[consciousness]] and was introduced in 2014 by [[Frederic Laloux]] in his book on [[Reinventing Organizations]].&lt;ref name="lalouxfred-book"&gt;{{cite book  | title= Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness |url= http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/ | location = |last= Laloux   |first =  Frederic |date = 2014 | publisher = Nelson Parker |page= 381 |isbn= 978-2960133509 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stratbusy&gt;{{cite web|title= The Future of Management Is Teal |url= https://www.strategy-business.com/article/00344?gko=10921 |website= Strategy + Business  |date= July 6, 2015  |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also rests on previous studies done by [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary]] and [[Social psychology|social psychologists]] including [[Jean Gebser]], [[Clare W. Graves]], [[Don Edward Beck]], Chris Cowan and [[Ken Wilbur|Ken Wilber]] who explored the stages of development and impact of human consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarewgraves.com/articles_content/1974_Futurist/1974_Futurist.html "Human Nature Prepares for a Momentous Leap"], by Clare W.

== Overview ==

In [[economics]], a '''virtual airline''' is an [[airline]] that has [[outsource]]d as many possible operational and business functions as it can, but still maintains effective control of its core business.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Such an airline focuses on operating a network of air services, and outsourcing non-core activities to other organizations.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Contracting out services within the aviation industry has reportedly become so common that many carriers could be classed as having features of a virtual airline, although it is arguable whether any current carriers meet a strict definition of the term.&lt;ref&gt;

The term is also used to describe travel companies and ticket agencies that market themselves as airlines, but are unlicensed and with flights undertaken by licensed operators often in the livery of the virtual airline.

==Origins==

Virtual airlines originated following the drastic changes brought about by the [[Airline Deregulation Act of 1978]]. During the hyper-competitive years immediately following deregulation, [[mainline (flight)|major airlines]] found it increasingly unprofitable to compete against start-up carriers on many routes they currently served. Instead of forfeiting the routes entirely, the larger carriers often made marketing arrangements with smaller airlines to fly under the "banner", or  [[aircraft livery]], of the larger airline. These [[regional airline]]s, mimicking the well known major airlines in adverts and prescribing to make connections as seamless as possible, soon abandoned their own local service routes. In most cases, the regional airlines found it more profitable to serve the mainline hubs as a feeder operation rather than operate on their own.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

[[File:Manx2plane.jpg|right|thumb|A Dornier 228 with the livery of virtual airline [[Manx2]], the aircraft was actually operated by FLM aviation with Manx2 being a ticket broker.]]
