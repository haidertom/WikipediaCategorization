The [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], which lasted from March 20 – May 1, 2003, resulted in a small number of American and [[Multinational force in Iraq|Coalition]] [[prisoner of war|POWs]].

==507th's wrong turn==
A majority of the prisoners of war were captured from the ambush of the [[507th Maintenance Company]]. Separated from a larger convoy, they were ambushed in the Iraqi-held town of [[Nasiriyah]] on March 23, 2003. Out of thirty-three soldiers, eleven were killed and seven captured in the fire fight. Several weapons jammed in the firefight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/10/world/after-the-war-inquiry-report-says-errors-and-fatigue-led-to-ambush-of-convoy.html|title=AFTER THE WAR: INQUIRY; Report Says Errors and Fatigue Led to Ambush of Convoy|last=Schmitt|first=Eric|date=7/10/2003|work=New York Times|access-date=11/3/2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following soldiers were captured by Iraqi forces:

|}

==Capture==
When they surrendered, they feared the worst. Miller held out little hope for mercy. "I thought they were going to kill me," he said. "That was the first thing I asked when they captured me: 'Are 
you going to kill me?' They said no. . . . I still didn't believe them."&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/04/14/sprj.irq.pows/index.html|title=Former POW: 'We were like Custer'|accessdate=2006-12-18 |publisher=CNN|date=April 14, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iraqi TV Interview==
Soon after their capture, Jessica Lynch was taken to an Iraqi hospital due to her serious injuries. The other five POWs did not know about Lynch surviving until after they were released.  After their capture, the five remaining members of the ambushed 507th would become famous as bloody and beaten. They were then interviewed by Iraq TV, and the footage was shown worldwide by [[Al Jazeera]]. In the interview, [[Patrick Miller (soldier)|Private First Class Patrick Miller]] was asked why he came to Iraq; his reply was "I come to fix broke stuff." Asked if he came to shoot Iraqis, he answered, "No, I come to shoot only if I am shot at. They don't bother me, I don't bother them."
&lt;ref name="Interview"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2003-03-23-pows-iraq-usat_x.htm|title=Iraq puts captive troops on TV|accessdate=2006-12-18 |agency=Associated Press|date=March 24, 2003|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two More Makes Eight==
On March 24, they were joined by Chief Warrant Officers David Williams, 31, and [[Ron Young (US Army officer)|Ronald Young Jr.]], 26, whose Apache chopper, from the 1-227 Helicopter Attack Battalion, had been shot down in central Iraq during the [[2003 attack on Karbala|attack on Karbala.]]

==Relocation==
The prisoners were taken to [[Baghdad]], where they were isolated in separate cells of a drab [[prison]] with concrete walls and a tin roof. As American troops got closer, the soldiers were shuffled from building to building. The Iraqi captors worked feverishly to stay one step ahead of the advancing units.

==Rescue==
As it became clear that the war was over for the Iraqis, some of their captors approached a Marine unit from the [[3rd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion|3rd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, Delta Co., 3rd Platoon]] which was a part of [[Task Force Tripoli]] that had been pushing up toward [[Tikrit]], [[Saddam Hussein]]'s hometown.  A Marine battalion was sent to check on the intelligence and found the seven POWs with a confused Iraqi guard unit, whose officers had fled.

On April 13, 2003, 21 days after the 507th members were captured, the 3rd Light Armored Recon Marines burst in on the Iraqi guards who gave up without a fight.  Ordering everyone on the floor, a Marine gave an order to "stand up if you're American!"  Given dirty prison clothes and fed little food, the prisoners lost a lot of weight and with their garb, and beards they looked like Iraqis.  "At first," [[Shoshana Johnson|Spc. Shoshana Johnson]] remembers that, "they didn't realize I was American. They said, 'Get down, get down,' and one of them said, 'No, she's American.' "&lt;ref name="SF"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/04/14/MN252903.DTL|title=Freedom for 7 American POWs|accessdate=2006-12-18 |last=Peter Baker, Washington Post|date=
April 14, 2003|work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within hours, the seven were on their way to Kuwait International Airport inside a Marine Corps KC-130 transport plane, the first stop before the United States. Amid sobs, cheers and laughter, they told their stories to two reporters accompanying them on the flight.  "I broke down. I was like, 'Oh my God, I'm home,'" Johnson said.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;

==War crimes==
During the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], Iraqi [[Saddam Fedayeen]] irregular forces were involved in executing several Coalition prisoners of war.

Sergeant [[Donald Walters]] was initially reported to have been killed in the March 23 ambush of the [[507th Maintenance Company]]. However, witnesses later reported that they had seen Walters being guarded by several Fedayeen in front of a building. Forensics work later found Walters' blood in front of the building and blood spatter suggesting he died from two gunshot wounds to the back at close range. This led the Army to conclude that Walters had been executed after being captured.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/05/27/iraq.pow/index.html Status changed for soldier killed in Iraq: Investigation shows POW was murdered - CNN]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jessica Lynch]] was reportedly raped and sodomized by Iraqi forces, based on scars, though she has no recollection of it happening.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/nov/07/usa.iraq&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on March 23, a British Army engineering unit made a wrong turn near the town of [[Az Zubayr]], which was still held by Iraqi forces. The unit was ambushed and Sapper Luke Allsopp and Staff Sergeant Simon Cullingworth became separated from the rest. Both were captured and executed by Iraqi forces. In 2006, a video of Allsopp lying on the ground surrounded by Iraqi irregular forces was discovered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1530205/Soldier-killed-in-convoy-ambush-'was-alive-for-four-hours-surrounded-by-mob'.html Soldier killed in convoy ambush 'was alive for four hours surrounded by mob' - The Telegraph]&lt;/ref&gt;

Marine Sergeant Fernando Padilla-Ramirez was reported missing from his supply unit after an ambush north of [[Nasiriyah]] on March 28. His body was later dragged through the streets of [[Ash Shatrah]] and hung in the town square. His body was later taken down and buried by sympathetic locals. His body was discovered by American forces on April 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/specials/special45/articles/profiles-part1.html |title=Invasion: Into the breach |publisher=Azcentral.com |date=2006-08-04 |accessdate=2013-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/Releases/Release.aspx?ReleaseID%3D3750 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910142414/http://www.defenselink.mil/Releases/Release.aspx?ReleaseID=3750 |archivedate=2008-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright 2004, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the showing of captured soldiers on television, as was done with some of the captured soldiers of the [[507th Maintenance Company]], was a violation of the [[Geneva Conventions]].

:''This article concerns the two antipopes Benedict XIV, claimants to the [[Papacy]] during the 15th century. Another [[Pope Benedict XIV]], canonically recognized as Pope, reigned in the 18th century.''

'''Benedict XIV''' was the name used by two closely related minor [[antipope]]s of the 15th century. The first, '''Bernard Garnier''' became [[antipope]] in 1424 and died c. 1429.&lt;ref&gt;John Julius Norwich, ''Absolute Monarchs: A History of the Papacy'', (Random House, 2011), 479.&lt;/ref&gt; The second, '''Jean Carrier''', became antipope c. 1430 and apparently left office, whether by death or resignation, by 1437.

Neither of these claimants was supported by more than a very small faction within the Church. They claimed to be the successors to [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]], one of the parties to the great [[Papal Schism]]. In 1417, the [[Council of Constance]] resolved the Schism, proclaiming [[Martin V]] the new Pope and demanding that Benedict XIII renounce his claim. Benedict XIII, however, remained at a castle in [[Peñíscola]] ([[kingdom of Valencia]]) and continued to maintain supporters. He died in 1423, but, the day before his death, he created four cardinals loyal to him, in order to ensure the Avignon line. Three of these cardinals met and elected [[Antipope Clement VIII]]. However, one of Benedict XIII's cardinals, Jean Carrier, disputed the validity of this election. Carrier, acting as the [[College of Cardinals]] by himself, elected Bernard Garnier, who took the name Pope Benedict XIV, instead.&lt;ref&gt;John-Peter Pham, ''Heirs of the Fisherman: Behind the Scenes of Papal Death and Succession'', (Oxford University Press, 2004), 332.&lt;/ref&gt; Carrier was the archdeacon of [[Rodez]], near [[Toulouse]], and Garnier had been the [[sacristan]] of Rodez.

Garnier conducted his office secretly and was known as the "hidden pope": a letter from the [[Count of Armagnac]] to [[Joan of Arc]] indicates that only Carrier knew Benedict XIV's location. Garnier's reign as Benedict XIV ended at his death in 1429 or 1430, although he named four of his own cardinals, one of whom was named Jean Farald.

Following Garnier's death, Jean Carrier elected himself as the new pope, and also styled himself Pope Benedict XIV.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Walsh, ''The Conclave: A Sometimes Secret and Occasionally Bloody History of Papal Elections'', (Canterbury Press, 2003), 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Carrier, however, had been captured and imprisoned by Antipope Clement VIII. Carrier finished his days in captivity in the castle of Foix.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Salembier, [https://archive.org/stream/greatschismwest00saleuoft#page/n365/mode/2up ''The Great Schism of the West''], (Keegan Paul, Trench, Trubner &amp; Co., 1907), 357.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
[[Antipopes in fiction|Some imagine]] that cardinals loyal to him elected a series of increasingly marginal antipopes in 1437 and 1470. For instance, this is the scenario in the 1995 novel ''[[l'Anneau du pêcheur]]'' by the French writer [[Jean Raspail]].&lt;ref&gt;''L'Anneau du pêcheur'', Paris : Albin Michel, 1994. 403 p. {{ISBN|2-226-07590-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6618">When studying [[literature]], '''biography and its relationship to literature''' is often a subject of [[literary criticism]], and is treated in several different forms. Two scholarly approaches use [[biography]] or biographical approaches to the past as a tool for interpreting literature: '''literary biography''' and [[biographical criticism]]. Additionally, two genres of fiction rely heavily on the incorporation of biographical elements into their content, [[biographical novel|biographical fiction]] and [[autofiction|autobiographical fiction]].

==Literary biography==
A literary biography is the biographical exploration of the lives of writers and artists. Biographies about artists and writers are sometimes some of the most complicated forms of biography.&lt;ref name = backschneider1113/&gt; Not only does the author of the biography have to write about the subject of the biography but also must incorporate discussion of the individual's literary works into the biography itself.&lt;ref name = backschneider1113/&gt;&lt;ref name = karl&gt;Karl, Frederick R. "Joseph Conrad" in Meyers (ed.) ''The Craft'', pp 69–88&lt;/ref&gt; Literary biographers must balance the weight of commentary on the individual works against the biographical content to create a coherent narrative.&lt;ref name = backschneider1113/&gt; This balance is affected by the degree of biographical elements in an author's literary works. The close relationship between writers and their work relies on ideas that connect human psychology and literature and can be examined through [[psychoanalytic theory]].&lt;ref name = karl/&gt;

Literary biography tends to have a plethora of autobiographical sources. Elizabeth Longford, a biographer of [[Wilfrid Blunt]], noted, "Writers are articulate and tend to leave eloquent source material which the biographer will be eager to use."&lt;ref name= longford&gt;Longford, Elizabeth "Wilfrid Scawen Blunt" of Meyers (ed.) ''The Craft'', pp 55-68&lt;/ref&gt; However, some authors and artists go out of their way to discourage the writing of their biographies, as was the case with Kafka, Eliot, Orwell and Auden. Auden said, "Biographies of writers whether written by others or themselves are always superfluous and usually in bad taste.... His private life is, or should be, of no concern to anybody except himself, his family and his friends."&lt;ref name = meyers&gt;Meyers, Jeffrey "Introduction" in Meyers (ed.) ''The Craft'', pp 1–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-received literary biographies include [[Richard Ellmann]]'s ''James Joyce'' and [[George Painter]]'s ''Marcel Proust''.&lt;ref name = backschneider1113&gt;Backschneider 11-13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = meyers/&gt;

==Biographical criticism==
{{main|Biographical criticism}}
Biographical criticism is the deliberate use of biographical information to shed light on the difference created by experience between an author and his audience, and so provide insight into how to understand that particular work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Benson| first = Jackson J| year = 1989| jstor = 25111810| title = Steinbeck: A Defense of Biographical Criticism| journal = College Literature| issue = 16| volume = 29| pages = 107–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biographical fiction==
{{see also|Biographical novel|Biographical film}}
Biographical fiction is a type of [[historical fiction]] that takes a historical individual and recreates elements of his or her life, while telling a fictional narrative, usually in the genres of film or the novel. The relationship between the biographical and the fictional may vary within different pieces of biographical fiction. It frequently includes selective information and self-censoring of the past. The characters are often real people or based on real people, but the need for "truthful" representation is less strict than in [[biography]]. 

The various philosophies behind biographical fiction lead to different types of content. Some asserts itself as a factual narrative about the historical individual, like [[Gore Vidal]]'s ''[[Lincoln (novel)|Lincoln]]''. Other biographical fiction creates two parallel strands of narrative, one in the contemporary world and one focusing on the biographical history, such as [[Malcolm Bradbury]]'s ''[[To the Hermitage]]'' and [[Michael Cunningham]]'s ''[[The Hours (novel)|The Hours]]''. No matter what style of biographical fiction is used, the novelist usually starts the writing process with historical research.&lt;ref name="mullan" /&gt;

Biographical fiction has its roots in late 19th and early 20th-century novels based loosely on the lives of famous people,  but without direct reference to them, such as [[George Meredith]]'s ''[[Diana of the Crossways]]'' (1885) and [[Somerset Maugham]]'s ''[[The Moon and Sixpence]]'' (1919). During the early part of the 20th century this became a distinct genre, with novels that were explicitly about individuals' lives.&lt;ref name = mullan&gt;{{cite news| title = Heavy on the source John Mullan analyses The Master by Colm Tóibín.

Autobiographical fiction, or autofiction, is fiction that incorporates the author's own experience into the narrative. It allows authors to both rely and reflect on their own experience. However, the reading of the autobiographical fiction need not always be associated with the author. Such books may be treated as distinct fictional works.&lt;ref name = bragg&gt;{{cite news| url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article5668638.ece| newspaper = The Sunday Times| date = 8 February 2009| title = Melvyn Bragg on autobiographical fiction| accessdate = 9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:STATUE OF BLONDELL NEAR DURNSTEIN IN THE WACHAU VALLEY.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Statue of Blondel near [[Durnstein]]]]
'''Blondel de Nesle''' – either '''Jean I of Nesle''' (c. 1155 – 1202) or his son '''Jean II of Nesle''' (died 1241) – was a [[France|French]] [[trouvère]].

The name 'Blondel de Nesle' is attached to twenty-four or twenty-five courtly songs. He was identified in 1942, by [[Holger Dyggve]], as Jean II of Nesle (near [[Amiens]]), who was nicknamed 'Blondel' for his long blond hair. He married at the time of his father's death in 1202, and that same year, went on the [[Fourth Crusade]]; he later fought in the [[Albigensian Crusade]]. However, in 1994, [[Yvan Lepage]] suggested that the poet may have been Jean I, father of Jean II, who was Lord of Nesle from 1180 to 1202; this Jean took part in the [[Third Crusade]], which may explain the subsequent legend linking him with [[Richard I of England|King Richard I of England]].

If the works are correctly identified and dated, he was a significant influence on his European contemporaries, who made much use of his melodies. (The melody of "L'amours dont sui espris" is used in ''[[Carmina Burana]]'', for the song "Procurans Odium"). His works are fairly conventional, and several have been recorded in modern times.

==Legend==
By 1260, Blondel's name had become attached to a legend in the highly fictionalised ''Récits d'un Ménestrel de Reims''; this claimed that, after King Richard of England was arrested and held for ransom in 1192, he was found by the [[minstrel]] Blondel, whom he saw from his window, and to whom he sang a verse of a song they both knew. Later versions of the story related that Blondel went from castle to castle, singing a particular song that only he and Richard knew, and that the imprisoned Richard replied with the second verse – thus identifying where he was imprisoned. Then, Blondel either aided the king's escape or reported his position back to his friends. Blondel finally found Richard at [[Dürnstein]]; in fact, there was no mystery about Richard's location which was widely publicized by his ransomers.

'Blondel' is a common [[surname]] on the [[Channel Island]] of [[Guernsey]]. It is recorded that King Richard granted a [[fief]] on the island to a [[vassal]] named Blondel, but it remains uncertain as to whether this has any connection with the legend, or whether the legend has any connection with the known trouvère.

==Modern versions==
The legend of Blondel did not achieve great popularity in the [[Middle Ages]], but was taken up in the late eighteenth century. It was the basis of [[André Ernest Modeste Grétry]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Richard Coeur-de-lion (opera)|Richard Coeur-de-lion]]'' (1784). In 1822, [[Eleanor Anne Porden]] used the legend in her epic poem ''Cœur De Lion'': in her version, Blondel is really Richard's wife, [[Berengaria of Navarre]], in disguise.

A poem by Johann Gabriel Seidl titled Blondel's Lied was set to music by [[Robert Schumann]].

Throughout the nineteenth century, the legend became a key component in the mythology surrounding Richard. Some later twentieth century novelists,  placed a [[homosexuality|homosexual]] interpretation on his supposed relationship with the king. [[Norah Lofts]] in ''The Lute Player'' (1951) has Richard make a (rather gentlemanly ) approach to Blondel, which is refused, Blondel's  heart and devotion being entirely given to Richard's neglected wife Berengaria. 

In the 1962–63 [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] British television series ''[[Richard the Lionheart (TV series)|Richard the Lionheart]]'', Blondel was a semi-regular character, played by [[Iain Gregory]].

The English acoustic band of the early 1970s, [[Amazing Blondel]], was named after Blondel.

The legend inspired ''[[Blondel (musical)|Blondel]]'', a 1983 [[musical theater|musical]] by [[Stephen Oliver (composer)|Stephen Oliver]] and [[Tim Rice]]. The play, a comedic [[rock opera]], is set during the period of the [[Third Crusade]]. Blondel is portrayed as a frustrated artist, seeking fame as a composer and performer, even as he searches for his imprisoned monarch. Rice collaborated with director [[Patrick Wilde]] to revive the show at the Pleasance Theatre in London in 2006.

The '''Bolton 7''' were a group of [[gay]] and [[bisexual]] men who were convicted on 12 January 1998 before Judge Michael Lever at [[Bolton]] Crown Court of the offences of gross indecency under the [[Sexual Offences Act 1956]] and of [[age of consent]] offences under the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]]. Although [[Gay sexual practices|gay sex]] was partially decriminalised by the [[Sexual Offences Act 1967]], they were all convicted under section 13 of the 1956 Act because more than two men had sex together, which was still illegal. One of the participants (Craig Turner) was also six months under the statutory [[age of consent]] for [[Gay sexual practices|gay sex]] which was 18 at the time. 

==Offences==
Under the provisions of the 1967 Act, the [[age of consent]] for [[Gay sexual practices|gay sex]] was different from that of the [[heterosexual]] [[age of consent]] of 16, and had only been reduced from 21 to 18 by the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]]. Equivalent [[heterosexual]] behaviour was not a crime.&lt;ref name=Dearden1999 &gt;{{Cite journal | last = Dearden | first = Nick | title = The Queen and the 'Bolton Seven' | journal = [[Feminist Legal Studies]] | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 317-332 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1023/A:1009218800557 | date = October 1999 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1009218800557 | quote= This note examines the case of a group of gay men who, having engaged in consensual sexual acts together, became known as the `Bolton Seven’ following their conviction in 1998 for offences of buggery and/or gross indecency. More particularly the note scrutinises the implications of the ages of the participants (one of whom, at 17 , was unable to give lawful consent to sexual intercourse with a man) in the light of the enactment of Part I of the Sex Offenders Act 1997 which introduces a system of compulsory registration by some convicted and cautioned sex offenders with the police (including men convicted of, or cautioned for, buggery or gross indecency). The note explores the justification for inclusion of these offences within the remit of the 1997 Act together with the cultural construction of gay men as predatory and as constituting a risk to younger members of society. It also analyses some of the effects of the registration requirement in terms of it constituting a potential violation of fundamental rights such as equality and respect for private life. This discussion is located particularly within the context of the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights and the introduction of the Human Rights Act 1998 in the U.K. | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The offences only came to light after police seized videos of the men having sex, which they had filmed for their own personal use. All the men were either lovers, ex-boyfriends, or friends of friends.

==Sentences==
During [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]] on 20 February 1998 Gary Abdie, David Godfrey, Mark Love and Jonathan Moore (all of whom were in their early 20s), and Craig Turner (17 at the time of the offences but 18 when he appeared in court) were given [[probation]] and [[community service]] orders. The Judge gave Norman Williams a two-year [[suspended sentence|suspended prison sentence]] and Terry Connell received a nine-month suspended sentence and was ordered to pay £500 towards the cost of the prosecution. Moore (20), Williams (33) and Connell (55) were also required to sign the Sex Offenders Register for the [[age of consent]] offences committed with Turner. Estimates of the overall cost of the prosecution were in the region of £500,000.

Despite their convictions, none of them received custodial sentences possibly as a  result of a high-profile campaign led by gay [[human rights]] group [[OutRage!]]. Over 400 letters were presented to the court in support of the men including those from MPs, Bishops and [[human rights]] groups. The letters urged the judge not to impose a custodial sentence, with one group, [[Amnesty International]], pledging to declare the men prisoners of conscience should they be imprisoned.

==Aftermath==
In 2000, six of the men appealed to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] arguing that the prosecutions against them had violated their rights under the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] by interfering with 'the right to respect for a private family life' enshrined in article 8  of the Convention. They were subsequently awarded compensation. As Williams was not part of the litigation, he was not deemed eligible by the Home Office for the compensation.

Legislation subsequently introduced by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Government has broadly equalised the treatment of [[homosexual]] and [[heterosexual]] behaviours in criminal law. The [[Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000]] equalised the [[age of consent]] for [[Gay sexual practices|gay sex]] with that of the [[heterosexual]] [[age of consent]] which is now 16 for both. The [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]], though subject to some controversy, introduced an overhaul in the way sexual offences are dealt with by the police and courts, replacing provisions that date as far back to the 1956 legislation. The offences of gross indecency and [[buggery]] have been repealed and sexual activity between more than two men is no longer a [[crime in the United Kingdom]].

In the creation and criticism of fictional works, a '''character flaw''' is a limitation, imperfection, problem, [[phobia]], or deficiency present in a character who may be otherwise very functional. The flaw can be a problem that directly affects the character's actions and abilities, such as a violent temper. Alternatively, it can be a simple foible or personality defect, which affects the character's motives and social interactions, but little else.

Flaws can add depth and humanity to the characters in a [[narrative]].  For example, the sheriff with a gambling addiction, the [[action hero]] who is afraid of heights, or a lead in a [[romantic comedy]] who must overcome his insecurity regarding male pattern baldness are all characters whose flaws help provide dimension.  Perhaps the most widely cited and classic of character flaws is [[Achilles]]' famous heel.

In general, flaws can be categorized as ''minor'', ''major'', or ''tragic''.

==Minor flaw==
A minor character flaw is an imperfection which serves to distinguish the character in the mind of the reader / viewer / player / listener, making them memorable and individual, but otherwise does not affect the story in any way.

Examples of this could include a noticeable scar, a thick accent or a habit such as cracking their knuckles.

[[Protagonists]] and other major characters may (and usually do) have multiple minor flaws, making them more accessible, and enabling the reader / viewer / listener to relate to the character (in the case of a [[sympathetic character]]) or otherwise influence the audience's opinions of the character.

Many insignificant or archetypal characters which are encountered only once or rarely are defined solely by a single minor flaw, differentiating them from the [[stock character]] or [[archetype]] that they adhere to.

==Major flaw==
A major character flaw is a much more noticeable and important hindrance which actually impairs the individual, whether physically, mentally or morally. Sometimes major flaws are not actually negative per se (such as devout religious beliefs or a rigid code of honor), but are classified as such in that they often serve to hinder or restrict the character in some way.

Examples of this type of flaw could include blindness, [[amnesia]] or greed.

Unlike minor flaws, major flaws are almost invariably important to either the character's, or the story's development.

*For villains, their major flaw is usually the cause of their eventual downfall.
*For heroes, their major flaw usually must be overcome (either temporarily or permanently) at some point in the story, often at the climax, by their own determination or skill.
*For neutral characters, or those that shift allegiance, the major flaw is usually the cause of either their corruption, redemption or both.
*For the protagonist, the most visible flaw generally serves a more vital interest, as well, as it defines his or her core problem.  It is the protagonist's reluctant (and usually unconscious) journey to address this problem that forms the spine of the story, sometimes acting as the [[MacGuffin]] to stimulate the plot.

==Tragic/fatal flaw==
This is a specific sort of flaw, also known as "[[Hamartia]]", which is possessed by Aristotelian [[tragic hero]]s. It is a flaw which causes an otherwise noble or exceptional character to bring about their own downfall and, often, their eventual death.

Examples of this could include [[hubris]], misplaced trust, excessive curiosity, pride and lack of self-control.

This fall usually occurs at the beginning of a story, with the story itself concentrates on the consequences or attempted redemption of the fall.

== Examples ==

*[[Tom Riddle|Tom Riddle's]] extreme [[thanatophobia]] eventually transformed him into the vile Lord Voldemort in his pursuit for [[immortality]]. (''[[Harry Potter]]'')
*[[Harry Potter]]'s worst flaws, as stated by Rowling, are "anger and occasional arrogance." However, within the text, it is implied his flaw might be his heroic desire to save people. (''[[Harry Potter]]'')
*[[Percy Jackson]] has a fatal flaw of excessive personal loyalty, while his girlfriend Annabeth Chase shares the flaw of the legendary Odysseus: hubris. (''[[Percy Jackson and the Olympians]]'')
*[[Jo March]]'s bluntness and hot temper cause conflict with her family. ''[[Little Women]]''
*In the ''[[Star Wars Expanded Universe|Star Wars Legends]]'' continuity, [[Jacen Solo|Jacen Solo's]] eventual downfall is linked to his placing the weight of the galaxy on his shoulder in his desire for peace.

===Film===
*In ''[[Rocky]]'', [[Rocky Balboa]] thinks of himself as a loser who cannot go the distance in the boxing ring.
*[[Anakin Skywalker]]'s anger and fear of losing his wife [[Padme Amidala|Padme]] eventually consumes him, leading to his transformation into [[Darth Vader]]. Whereas his mentor [[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi's]] compassion and love for his student blinded him to the path Skywalker was taking. (''[[Star Wars]]'')
*In ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', Rick thinks of himself as an unfeeling cynic who denies the pain and disappointment from a failed love affair with Ilsa.
*In ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', the detective played by [[James Stewart]] is afraid of heights and has to climb a tower.
*[[Captain Hook]] is obsessed with ''[[Peter Pan]]''

*[[The Tenth Doctor]] is constantly trying to help and save the lives of others, and sometimes does things out of anger that have dire consequences later: ''[[Doctor Who]]''
*[[Mr. Gold|Rumplestiltskin's]] greatest character flaw was his greed, losing even those who love him over his mad desire for power. He shares this flaw with his former student and lover [[Cora Mills|Cora]]. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'') 
*[[Zelena (Once Upon a Time)|Zelena's]] envy of her younger half-sister [[Regina Mills]] eventually transformed her into the infamous [[Wicked Witch of the West]] as she planned to reverse time and supplant Regina. Even after this plan was thwarted, her envy remained a great character flaw throughout her time on the show. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')
*After the death of her fiance Daniel Colter, [[Regina Mills|Regina]] suffered a mental breakdown and became consumed with anger, which Rumplestiltskin was able to use to shape her into the Evil Queen who would cast his Dark Curse. Anger, as a fatal flaw, is one she shares with [[Hook (Once Upon a Time)|Killian Jones]] whose own anger transformed him into vengeful [[Captain Hook]]; however, Hook did not share Regina's mental instability. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')
*The main character flaw of the protagonist of the series, [[Emma Swan]], are her tendency to mistrust other people, which leads her to put up emotional barriers to protect herself and run when things get difficult.

The Emperor envisages a human civilization free of the shackles of religion and dogma and chastises Lorgar and his legion for worshipping him. Hurt and depressed by the humiliation of his father's rebuke, Lorgar and the [[Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)|Space Marines]] of the XVII Legion (the "Word Bearers") search for another purpose to sustain them, and in doing so become the first legion to fall under the malicious influence of [[Chaos (Warhammer)|Chaos]]. Their devotion to Chaos sees them instigate the devastating civil war known as the [[Horus Heresy (fictional event)|Horus Heresy]], the events of which led to the current dystopian setting of Warhammer 40,000.
*In ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'', Liquid's jealousy of Solid Snake's "dominant genes" and his desire to be the better of the two sets much of the story in motion, leading to Liquid's eventual downfall.
*In the ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'' series, [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]] acts brutally and violently out of anger and desire for revenge, with devastating consequences on his only life and the world around him.

The word '''character sketch''' means a rough-and-ready rendering or thumbnail portrayal of an individual, capturing, in brief, that person's physical characteristics, psychological attributes, and the like. The brief descriptions often capitalize on the more unusual or humorous aspects of the person’s character. Character sketches are usually identified by irony, humor, exaggeration, and satire. The term originates in portraiture, where the character sketch is a common academic exercise. The artist performing a character sketch attempts to capture an expression or gesture that goes beyond coincident actions and gets to the essence of the individual.

The first English writer to delve into the form was Joseph Hall in his book Characters of Virtues and Vices which was published in 1608. However, the character sketch didn’t become popular amongst the literate public until the late seventeenth century. The public appreciated sketches for their humor and readable style.   As Pat Rogers notes, [[Henry Fielding]], in book I, chapter 14 of ''[[Joseph Andrews]]'', invokes William Hogarth to create a character sketch of Mrs. Tow-wouse: "Indeed, if Mrs. Tow-wouse had given no Utterance to the Sweetness of her Temper, Nature had taken such Pains in her Countenance, that Hogarth himself never gave more Expression to a Picture." Thomas Overbury, John Earle, Richard Steele, and Joseph Addison also wrote notable character sketches. Addison and Steele’s sketches appeared in a periodical that was issued twice a week under the name “The Spectator Papers.” They created several personas such as Roger de Coverly, Mr. Spectator, and Captain Sentry who represented different classes in English society. From the point of view of these personas, Addison and Steele wrote sketches that addressed important events in the social and political atmospheres. In America, Walt Whitman published a series of remarkable character sketches in 1856. Whitman’s sketches involved mostly physical descriptions, however, like Addison and Steele, his sketches were written with a purpose. Rather than make social or political commentary, Whitman used the opportunity to provide sketches that publicly praised his friends and ridiculed his enemies.

In later literature, a character sketch became a short story or narrative presented without significant action or plot, as the purpose of the writing is solely to present a character at his or her typical.  Character sketches of this sort are also frequently found in journalism and regionalist humor (e.g., sketches of "Big John" or "the country rube" or "the wise Squire").  Each of these attempts to delineate a model of a type (a category of person) rather than a realistic person.

Today, the character sketch appears mostly in the writings of satiric novelists such as Thomas Pynchon. The character sketch has also been adapted to appear on television in both dramatic and comedic forms such as TV serial,movies etc.

'''Chitti''' is a fictional character and the primary [[protagonist]] and [[antagonist]] of the films [[Enthiran]] and [[2.0 (film)|2.0]]. The character was portrayed by [[Rajinikanth]] in ''[[Enthiran]]'', a non-canon [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] in ''[[Ra.One]]'', and in ''[[2.0 (film)|2.0]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=‘2.0’ Teaser Review: Chitti, Chitti, Bang Bang.

==Design ==
The visual appearance of Chitti was based on the [[G.I. Joe]] [[action figure]]s. For Chitti's [[2.0 (film)|2.0]] version look, its hair was spiked and brown coloured lenses were used for its eyes, whereas for its "good robot" look, green coloured lenses were used. The wig used for Chitti's 2.0 look had a silver streak in the middle, made out of [[Yak]] hair,&lt;ref name="Banu Sify"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sify.com/movies/banu-i-give-full-credit-to-rajini-sir-news-tamil-kkjrmldfhchsi.html | title=Banu&amp;nbsp;– I give full credit to Rajini sir | publisher=Sify | date=9 October 2010 | accessdate=21 February 2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221074710/http://www.sify.com/movies/banu-i-give-full-credit-to-rajini-sir-news-tamil-kkjrmldfhchsi.html | archivedate=21 February 2015 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; while its leather jacket was designed by Vogt.&lt;ref name="Banu Sify" /&gt; To make Vaseegaran look mature, the team made Rajinikanth sport an [[Beard#Styles|Oakley beard]].{{refn|According to Banu, an Oakley beard is "neither a French beard not a full beard".

==Abilities==
Chitti is described by Vaseegaran as an advanced "[[Humanoid robot|andro-humanoid]]" robot. Over his metallic body, he sports synthetic inorganic skin molded after Vaseegaran himself. He is designed with a speed capacity of 1 Terahertz (Hz) and a memory capacity of 1 Zettabyte.

Initially, Chitti has been programmed with almost all the existing world knowledge managed to put in computable terms in his CPU, thus he is knowledgeable and proficient in all forms of academia, martial arts, communication, creative outlets, athletic skills, and scientific ingenuity. 
Underneath his synthetic skin, he is fire, water, and acid-resistant. 

In his original form, he is partially resistant to severe damage such as gunshots, though he can still be damaged or destroyed by properly aimed and adequately forceful attacks such as being chopped with an axe in the joints. Severe electrocution can also overload short-circuit him.  As long as his CPU head is still functioning, Chitti is able to repair or fix back his minor parts such as eyes. However, for large damage such as limbs being chopped off, he can only put them back in place and function at a much slower speed.

Chitti's eyes are able to not only see and scan his surroundings to extremely acute detail, including X-ray vision, but they can also serve as high-definition projectors. His eyes also allow him to pick up additional skills within seconds. He can also perform virtual phone calls, with displaying his caller or receiver through his eyes as a hologram. However, on downside, the eyes get bleached when exposed to flash light.

Chitti is able to adhere to metal objects through his selective magnetism. This allows him to both render his foes weaponless, as well as fly for a certain distance to any nearby metallic structure. He is physically able to exert superhuman speed, agility and strength; he is at least able to lift with ease a convertible car, and even pull two trucks towards himself while they are in motion. In the second half of ''Enthiran'' as well as in ''2.0'', he designs and equips himself with a "handgun", which is basically a retractable firearm within his right hand.

Chitti's only known weaknesses are flashing lights, which temporarily distort his sight, and his susceptibility to battery drainage. However, in the case of the latter, he just needs to absorb a bare minimum amount of electric power to recharge himself in a matter of seconds.

==Appearances==
In the first film, ''[[Enthiran]]'', Chitti (played by [[Rajnikanth]]) is an android robot created by Dr. Vaseegaran, (also played by Rajinikanth). Dr. Vaseegaran, who is specialised in robotics, created Chitti after a decade of intensive research. Chitti was first created without emotions however in order for the robot to understand human behaviour, Vaseegaran taught the robot about them. But then the robot fell in love with the scientist's fiancée, Sana (played by [[Aishwarya Rai]]) and thus it caused conflict between them. Angered by the robot, Vaseegaran literally chopped the robot into pieces. He was found by Dr. Bohra (played by [[Danny Denzongpa]]) and upgrade into 2.0 because of a red chip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Hindu : Entertainment Chennai : Director's dream project |url=https://www.thehindu.com/fr/2005/03/11/stories/2005031101810100.htm |accessdate=24 September 2018 |work=www.thehindu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He converts it into a ruthless killer and turned into an evil destructive killing machine and killed Bohra. He then went after Vaseegaran and Sana and crashed their wedding. He showed numerous other powerful abilities including shape shifting as well as duplicating. He caused so much damage and destruction to the city. However, Vaseegaran managed to defeat and stop Chitti. Since he caused so much damage and destruction to the city, he was de-activated and dismantled. His body parts were then displayed in the museum in the year 2030 as the most advanced humanoid robot ever built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=‘Script decides the fate of the movie' |url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/lsquoScript-decides-the-fate-of-the-movie/article15609945.ece |accessdate=24 September 2018 |work=The Hindu |date=27 December 2010 |language=en-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chitti reappeared in the film ''[[Ra.One]]'' in a special appearance and communicated with [[G.One (character)|G.One]] (played by [[Shah Rukh Khan]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Revealed! What Rajinikanth’s Chitti does in Ra.One's Chammak Challo |url=https://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-revealed-what-rajinikanth-s-chitti-does-in-raone-s-chammak-challo-1594868 |accessdate=24 September 2018 |work=dna |date=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Rajnikanth reprising his role. This appearance is non-canon, meaning both this and Chitti's film franchise don't share the same continuity.

In the 2018 film ''[[2.0 (film)|2.0]]'' with Rajnikanth reprising his role one more time, Chitti is forced to be reassembled by Dr. Vaseegaran and the Indian Army in order to stop the antagonist, [[Fifth force]], which is controlled by Pakshi Rajan, an [[Ornithologist]] (played by [[Akshay Kumar]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=2.0: Rajinikanth and Akshay Kumar film trailer to release on Diwali 2018? |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/regional-cinema/story/2point0-trailer-on-diwali-2018-rajinikanth-akshay-kumar-1346962-2018-09-23 |accessdate=24 September 2018 |work=India Today |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Rajinikanth Effect: 2.0 Teaser Gets Blockbuster Welcome - 32 Million Views in 24 Hours |url=https://www.ndtv.com/entertainment/the-rajinikanth-effect-2-0-teaser-gets-blockbuster-welcome-32-million-views-in-24-hours-1916413 |accessdate=24 September 2018 |work=NDTV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=2.0 Movie Review : Is 2.0 worth for watching or not? |url=https://www.indianpeopletimes.com/entertainment/2-0-movie-review-is-2-0-worth-for-watching-or-not|accessdate=30 November 2018 |work=indianpeopletimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;But Chitti is defeated and destroyed in his original form by the antagonist, which leads his CPU head to being rebooted in another advanced mechanical body, identifying himself as Chitti reloaded version '2.0', and will also fall in love with his female counterpart, the super-android Nila (played by [[Amy Jackson]]), also created by Vaseegaran. Alongside Chitti, there is another robot created known as version 3.0 which is a dwarf.

&lt;!--[[Image:Cipitio.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Cipitio is the most popular character of Salvadoran mythology.]]--&gt;

'''Cipitio''' is a legendary character found in [[El Salvador|salvadoran]] folklore revolving around the [[Siguanaba]] and [[Cadejo]] legends.  He is generally portrayed as an  8- to 10-year-old boy with a big conical wizard hat.  His name is taken from the [[Nahuatl]] word for child: "Cipit" or "Cipote". Some also relate his name to the deity [[Xipe Totec]].

According to the legend, he is the son of a forbidden romance between an indigenous Mesoamerican queen called Sihuehuet or Ziguet, now commonly known as La [[Siguanaba]], and "Lucero de la mañana" (Lúcifer Morningstar). Cipitio is the child of this affair.  When Ziguet's husband found out about this affair he sought the assistance of the very powerful god [[Teotl]]. Ziguet and ''Cipitio'' were cursed and condemned by [[Teotl]].  Cipitio was going to live forever as a small boy with his feet in backwards position, as a reminder of the twisted and illicit affair of his parents.  Stories are told of farmers that come to their fields and find the footsteps of a boy, but eventually get lost following them because, not knowing that '''Cipitio''' has his feet backwards, they follow them in the wrong direction.&lt;ref&gt;Kampwirth and Gonzalez 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cipitio''' is represented as liking to eat ashes,&lt;ref&gt;Kephart.&lt;/ref&gt; throwing pebbles to beautiful ladies,&lt;ref&gt;Cordova 19.&lt;/ref&gt; and likes to eat a variety of [[banana]] called "Guineo Majoncho". He could also "[[Teleportation|Teleport]]" anywhere he wants.

A couple of short stories with this character can be found in the book ''Cuentos de Cipotes'' by the Salvadoran writer and poet Salvador [[Salarrué]].

In a TV show for the Salvadoran Educational Television Station he is portrayed by Rolando Meléndez, who has played the role for several seasons. Each episode features the problems that Salvadoran children find in their communities, families and schools, Cipitio helps them while teaching morals and values.

On 18 March 2013, [[Pope Francis]] adopted in his [[papal coat of arms]] the [[coat of arms]] and the [[motto]] that he used since his [[episcopal consecration]] in 1991, differenced following his election as [[Supreme Pontiff]].&lt;ref name="OR"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/francesco/elezione/stemma-papa-francesco_it.html | title=Lo Stemma di Papa Francesco | publisher=[[L'Osservatore Romano]] | date=March 18, 2013 | access-date=March 18, 2013 | language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charges and field==
His [[coat of arms]] displays three [[Charge (heraldry)|charges]] on a blue [[Field (heraldry)|field]]. In reference to Francis being a [[Jesuit]], the uppermost charge is the emblem of the [[Society of Jesus]].&lt;ref name="OR"/&gt; The emblem is composed of a  [[Sun (heraldry)|Sun radiant]], within which is the IHS [[christogram]] (a [[monogram]] of the [[Holy Name of Jesus]]) in red, with a red cross surmounting the H and three black nails below the H.&lt;ref name="OR"/&gt; 

Below the Jesuit emblem is an eight-pointed star, the [[Our Lady, Star of the Sea|star]] being  a long-standing symbol of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], and a [[spikenard]] representing [[Saint Joseph]].&lt;ref name="OR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VIS"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.news.va/en/news/pope-francis-miserando-atque-eligendo | title=Pope Francis : "Miserando atque eligendo"... | publisher=[[Vatican Information Service]] | date=March 18, 2013 | accessdate=March 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= NCR/&gt; In [[Hispanic]] iconographic tradition Saint Joseph is often depicted with a branch of spikenard in his hand.&lt;ref name="OR2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/francesco/elezione/stemma-papa-francesco_it.html | title=Lo Stemma di Papa Francesco | publisher=[[L'Osservatore Romano]] | date=March 18, 2013 | accessdate=4 December 2016 | language=Italian}} "La stella, secondo l’antica tradizione araldica, simboleggia la Vergine Maria, madre di Cristo e della Chiesa; mentre il fiore di nardo indica San Giuseppe, patrono della Chiesa universale. Nella tradizione iconografica ispanica, infatti, San Giuseppe è raffigurato con un ramo di nardo in mano."&lt;/ref&gt; 

These charges appeared on Bergoglio's previous coat of arms displayed when he was [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Buenos Aires|Archbishop of Buenos Aires]],&lt;ref name= NCR&gt;{{cite news |title=Pope stresses simplicity, ecumenism in inaugural Mass plans |url= http://ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/pope-stresses-simplicity-ecumenism-inaugural-mass-plans|newspaper= [[National Catholic Reporter]] |date=18 March 2013 |accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as Pope the [[tincture (heraldry)|tincture]] of the star and the spikenard were elevated from ''Argent'' (silver) to ''Or'' (gold). The first version of the [[Coats of arms of the Holy See and Vatican City|papal coat of arms]] published by the Vatican showed a five-pointed star from Bergoglio's previous one, but this was later amended to eight points; the representation of the spikenard was also slightly altered so it would resemble leaves rather than what appears to look like grapes.

==Blazon==

The Vatican has not yet published the official [[blazon]] of the arms, but an approximation has been made by John Hamilton Gaylor, as follows:
:''Azure on a Sun in Splendour Or the IHS Christogram ensigned with a Cross paty fitchy piercing the H Gules all above three Nails fanwise points to centre Sable, and in dexter base a Mullet of eight points and in sinister base a Spikenard flower Or.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wedvick of Jarlsby - Religious/Francis, H. H. Pope 3 |url=http://wedvickofjarlsby.org/webvick-gallery/displayimage.php?album=7&amp;pos=24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206134335/http://wedvickofjarlsby.org/webvick-gallery/displayimage.php?album=7&amp;pos=24 |archivedate=2013-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==External ornaments==
Traditionally, a [[Pope]]'s coat of arms was externally adorned only by the three-tiered [[Papal Tiara|papal tiara]] with lappets and the crossed keys of [[Saint Peter]] with a cord. The tiara represented the roles of authority of the Pope, while the keys represent the power to loose and bind in Heaven as on earth.&lt;ref&gt;({{bibleverse||Matt|16:19|63}})&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Francis' arms maintain the keys, but replaced the tiara (as did his predecessor) with a [[mitre|triband mitre]]. 

The [[Papal Tiara|tiara]] and keys remain the symbol of the [[papacy]] and appear on the [[coat of arms]] of the [[Holy See]] and (reversed) on the flag of [[Vatican City]].

===Mitre===
[[File:BANDERA GUARDIA VATICA PANCHO.svg|thumb|right|250px|[[Banner of the Pontifical Swiss Guard]] with Pope Francis' coat of arms]]
As with his [[Coat of arms of Pope Benedict XVI|predecessor's personal arms]], Francis replaced the traditional [[papal triregnum]] by adopting a [[tincture (heraldry)|silver]] [[mitre]] with three gold bands. These bands allude to the papal tiara's three [[crown (headgear)|crown]]s, which came to represent the three powers of Orders, Jurisdiction, and Magisterium, all joining at the centre depicting unity in the same person. Coincidentally, the three stripes and the vertical stripe in the center of the mitre also forms the Chinese character for “sovereign” (王).

===Motto===
[[File:Coat of arms of Jorge Mario Bergoglio.svg|thumb|Coat of arms as Cardinal Bergoglio]]
Unusually, Francis also decided to retain his personal [[motto]]: ''Miserando atque eligendo''. It is taken from the 21st [[homily]] of [[Bede|Saint Bede]], which is on the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and refers to the [[vocation]] of [[Saint Matthew]].&lt;ref name="OR"/&gt; He writes:

:"Vidit ergo Iesus publicanum et quia '''miserando atque eligendo''' vidit, ait illi 'Sequere me'." (Om. 21; CCL 122, 149-151)
:"Jesus saw the tax collector and, because '''he saw him through the eyes of mercy and chose him''', he said to him: Follow me." (trans. ''[[Liturgy of the Hours]]'' 1975, p. 1418)

Bede is here discussing Matthew 9:9-13. The salient point is that Jesus chose Matthew as his disciple not in spite but because of his being a sinner. In the Douay Rheims translation: 
&lt;ol start=9&gt;&lt;li&gt; And when Jesus passed on from hence, he saw a man sitting in the custom house, named Matthew; and he saith to him: Follow me. And he rose up and followed him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; And it came to pass as he was sitting at meat in the house, behold many publicans and sinners came, and sat down with Jesus and his disciples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; And the Pharisees seeing it, said to his disciples: Why doth your master eat with publicans and sinners?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; But Jesus hearing it, said: They that are in health need not a physician, but they that are ill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Go then and learn what this meaneth, I will have mercy and not sacrifice. For I am not come to call the just, but sinners.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

The statement from the Vatican announcing the Pope's coat of arms and motto explained that the phrase had a special meaning for Francis as he felt it recalled his own vocation, when at the age of 17, he went to [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|confession]] on St Matthew's day in 1953.&lt;ref name="OR"/&gt;

The '''coat of arms of the [[Kingdom of Sweden]]''' ({{lang-sv|Sveriges riksvapen}}) has a lesser and a greater version.

== Regulated usage ==
The usage of the coats of arms is regulated by Swedish Law, [[Swedish Code of Statutes|Act]] [http://www.notisum.se/rnp/sls/lag/19700498.HTM 1970:498], which states (in unofficial translation) that "in commercial activities, the coats of arms, the flag or other official insignia of Sweden may not be used in a trademark or other insignias for products or services without proper authorisation. This includes any mark or text referring to the Swedish State which this can give the commercial mark a sign of official endorsement. This includes municipal coats of arms which are registered."

Any representation consisting of three crowns ordered two above one are considered to be the lesser coat of arms, and its usage is therefore restricted by law 1970:498.

==Variants==
The arms of Sweden were first formally codified by law in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/rikskal/1909/0002.html|title=i (Svensk rikskalender / 1909)|website=Runeberg.org|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law also formally codifies the differences between the "greater" and "lesser" arms. The present law prescribing the two arms dates from 1982.

===Greater version===
The greater coat of arms is blazoned in Swedish law as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''A shield [[azure (heraldry)|azure]], quartered by a cross [[Or (heraldry)|Or]] with outbent arms, and an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|inescutcheon]] containing the dynastic arms of the Royal House. In the first and fourth fields three [[Crown (heraldry)|open crowns]] Or, placed two above one. In the second and third fields three sinisterbendwise streams [[argent]], a [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]] crowned with an open crown Or armed [[gules]]. The inescutcheon is [[Division of the field|party per pale]] the arms for the [[House of Vasa]] (Bendwise azure, argent and gules, a ''vasa'' Or); and the [[House of Bernadotte]] (Azure, issuant from a wavy base a bridge with three arches and two towers embattled argent, in honor point an eagle regardant with wings inverted resting on thunderbolts Or, and in chief the Big Dipper constellation of the same). The main shield is crowned by a royal crown and surrounded by the insignia of the [[Order of the Seraphim]]. [[Supporters|Supported]] by two lions regardant, crowned and with forked tails Or armed gules, standing on a [[Compartment (heraldry)|compartment]] Or. All surrounded by [[Ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] mantling, crowned with a royal crown and tied up with tasseladorned strings Or.''&lt;ref&gt;Original text of Swedish statute 1982:268, 2 §, states: ''Stora riksvapnet utgörs av en blå huvudsköld, kvadrerad genom ett kors av guld med utböjda armar, samt en hjärtsköld som innehåller det kungliga husets dynastivapen. Huvudsköldens första och fjärde fält innehåller tre öppna kronor av guld, ordnade två över en. Huvudsköldens andra och tredje fält innehåller tre ginbalksvis gående strömmar av silver, överlagda med ett upprest, med öppen krona krönt lejon av guld med röd tunga samt röda tänder och klor. Hjärtskölden är kluven. Första fältet innehåller Vasaättens vapen: ett i blått, silver och rött styckat fält, belagt med en vase av guld. Andra fältet innehåller ätten Bernadottes vapen: i blått fält en ur vatten uppskjutande bro med tre valv och två krenelerade torn, allt av silver, däröver en örn av guld med vänstervänt huvud och sänkta vingar gripande om en åskvigg av guld samt överst Karlavagnens stjärnbild av guld. Huvudskölden är krönt med en kunglig krona och omges av Serafimer ordens insignier. Sköldhållare är två tillbakaseende, med kunglig krona krönta lejon med kluvna svansar samt röda tungor, tänder och klor. Lejonen står på ett postament av guld. Det hela omges av en med kunglig krona krönt hermelinsfodrad vapenmantel av purpur med frans av guld och uppknuten med tofsprydda snören av guld. Stora riksvapnet får brukas även utan ordensinsignier, sköldhållare, postament eller vapenmantel.''

The greater arms may also be displayed only with the crowned escutcheon. While the arms have undergone significant changes over the years, such as changing the inescutcheon with the ruling dynasty, they are based on arms created by King [[Charles VIII of Sweden|Karl Knutsson]] in 1448.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] used in the greater blazon has in total five elements: 4 [[Quartering (heraldry)|quarterings]] on the main escutcheon (two coats of arms duplicated), and three coat of arms incorporated into an escutcheon of pretense. However, Bernadotte never used any stars in the arms of Pontecorvo (neither as Prince of Pontecorvo, nor as King of Sweden and Norway). The stars were introduced as an element in the royal coat of arms in the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Berghman |first=Arvid |title=Dynastien Bernadottes vapen och det svenska riksvapnet |series=Skrifter / utgivna av Riksheraldikerämbetet, 99-2298099-1 ; 1 |year=1944 |publisher=Svensk litteratur |location=Stockholm |language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; chosen as a symbol of Sweden's eternal existence, as in the poem by [[Esaias Tegnér]]:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;As long as [[Charles's Wain]] still turns,
Its golden wheels around the Northern zone,
As long as the land still produces iron and heroes,
Intact shall stand the ancient Swedish throne.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

This symbol became especially popular through its allusion to the name that had been borne by so many famous Swedish kings. [[Ursa Major]], or as it is called in Swedish, ''Karlavagnen'' (Charles' Wain), adds a Swedish accent to the Bernadotte dynastic coat of arms much in the same way as do the Vasa arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theheraldrysociety.com/articles/early_history_of_heraldry/the_three_crowns_of_sweden.htm|title=The Heraldry Society|website=Theheraldrysociety.com|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Personal command-sign of the King of Sweden.svg|thumb|left|The personal command sign, for military use, of the King is a rendition of the emblazonment of the greater arms. Introduced by royal regulation in 1943, it has only been created once.]]

The arms are supported by two lions with forked tails (''queue fourchée''), facing away from the shield and crowned with Royal Crowns. For centuries, the lion has been an important element in Swedish heraldry and especially for the State Coat of Arms. The shield may be surmounted by the Collar of the [[Order of Seraphim]], the foremost order in Sweden, and the highest honour the Swedish state can bestow on an individual.&lt;ref&gt;See sections 2 and 3, Lag No. 268 om Sveriges Riksvapen of April 29, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides being the official national coat of arms, the greater coat of arms is also the personal coat of arms of the king, and as such he can decree its use as a personal coat of arms by other members of the [[House of Bernadotte|Royal House]], with the alterations and additions decided by him.

[[Blazon]]: "The greater state arms consist of a head shield azure, quartered by a cross or with outbent arms, and an [[inescutcheon]] containing the dynastic arms of the Royal House.

In the first and fourth fields three coronets or, placed two above one. In the second and third fields three sinisterbendwise streams argent, a lion crowned with an open crown or with armaments gules. The inescutcheon is party per pale the arms for the [[House of Vasa]] and the [[House of Bernadotte]]. The main shield is crowned by a royal crown and surrounded by the insignia of the [[Order of the Seraphim]]. Supported by two lions regardant or crowned, with parted tails and armaments gules, standing on a postament. All surrounded by hermine mantling crowned with a royal crown and tied up with tasseled strings or."

===Lesser version===
The lesser coat of arms is mainly used by the [[Government of Sweden]] and subordinate government authorities. As such it may be joined by insignias symbolising the activity of individual government agencies, following approval by the State Board of Heraldry. It is, for instance, embroidered on all [[Swedish police]] uniforms and in various coats of arms of the [[Swedish Armed Forces]].

Blazon: "Azure, with three coronets Or, ordered two above one." Crowned with a royal crown. The shield may also be surrounded by the insignias of the [[Order of the Seraphim]]."

The '''coat of arms of the Prince of Wales''' is the official [[Heraldry|heraldic]] insignia of the [[Prince of Wales]], a title traditionally granted to the [[heir apparent]] to the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|reigning monarch]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], formerly the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and before that the [[Kingdom of England]].

The [[coat of arms]], in its current form, was devised for [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] in 1958. It contains the badges and elements taken from all four of the [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent countries of the United Kingdom]] as well as from the many [[List of titles and honours of Charles, Prince of Wales|titles the prince holds]] as [[heir apparent]].

The history of the coat of arms is closely linked with that of the [[Royal Arms of England|Royal coat of arms of England]] and the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom]]. However, as the noted antiquarian and heraldist [[Charles Boutell]] wrote in 1863, "The Arms of the Prince of Wales have a distinct individuality of their own, with which nothing ought to be directly associated."&lt;ref name="Boutell 256"&gt;Boutell p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements==
====Coronet====
[[File:Ströhl-Regentenkronen-Fig. 31.png|thumb|130px|left|The British heir-apparent's coronet as depicted by [[Hugo Gerard Ströhl]]]]
The [[Coronet|coronets of the Prince and the Peers]] of the realm were regulated by King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] by Royal Warrant, signed on 9 February 1661. Part of the warrant proclaimed: "Our Will and Pleasure therefore is, That the Son and Heir Apparent of the Crown for the time being, shall use and bear his Coronet composed of Crosses and [[Fleur-de-lis|Flower-de-Lized]] with one Arch; and in the midst a [[Globus cruciger|Ball and Cross]], as hath our Royal Diadem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/prince_highness_docs.htm#The_Warrant_of_1661 |title=Warrant of Feb 9, 1661|accessdate=2018-08-10 |work=www.heraldica.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, the heraldic coronet used in the Prince of Wales's coat of arms is similar to the [[Crown (heraldry)|heraldic crown]] ([[St. Edward's crown]]) used in the Royal arms, except that instead of two intersecting arches it has only one. Boutell wrote that: "It should be noticed, however, that this coronet belongs to the prince as eldest son of the Sovereign and heir-apparent to the Throne, and not as Prince of Wales". The coronet is also used by the Prince of Wales's consort, in her coat of arms.&lt;ref name="Boutell 363"&gt;Boutell p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;

The heir's coronet was confirmed in another Royal Warrant signed on 19 November 1917 by King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]]. The warrant proclaimed: "by the son and heir apparent of the sovereign and his successors a coronet composed of crosses and fleurs-de-lis with one arch and in the midst a ball and cross as in the royal crown."&lt;ref name="1917 warrant"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/prince_highness_docs.htm#Warrant_of_Nov_19_1917 |title=Warrant of Nov 19, 1917|accessdate=2018-08-10 |work=www.heraldica.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently there are three physical examples of coronets used at one time or other as part of the [[Honours of the Principality of Wales]]; the [[Coronet of Frederick, Prince of Wales|Coronet of Frederick]], the [[Coronet of George, Prince of Wales|Coronet of George]] and the [[Coronet of Charles, Prince of Wales|Coronet of Charles]]. However these physical manifestations have not affected the graphical representation of the coronet in heraldic art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.royal.uk/honours-principality-wales |title=Honours of the Principality of Wales |website=www.royal.uk |access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Label====
Beginning with the reign of King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], a [[Label (heraldry)|label]] of three points [[Azure (heraldry)|Azure]] (or blue) was used by his son, the future King [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], to differentiate his arms from those of his father. Without such a label their arms would be identical. Within [[heraldry]] this system of differentiating arms is called [[cadency]]. The label is placed on the [[Chief (heraldry)|chief]] (or top) of the [[shield]] of arms, with the ends extending across from the dexter to the sinister sides of the shield. It was Prince [[Edward the Black Prince]], heir of King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], who first used a label of three points [[Argent]], also white or silver. This has been the label of the heir apparent ever since, without regard to the system of [[Cadency labels of the British royal family|cadency used by other members]] of the royal family.&lt;ref name="Official Web"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boutell p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

====Crest====
[[File:Prince of Wales 1914.png|thumb|200px|right|Coat of arms of [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward, Prince of Wales]] as illustrated in [[Burke's Peerage]] 1914 edition.]]
The Prince of Wales's [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] follows closely that of the Sovereign, but always with the appropriate label of [[Cadency|difference]] displayed. This crest depicts a "Lion [[Or (heraldry)|Or]], passant guardant, wearing a coronet of the Heir, and differenced on the shoulders with a label of three points Argent." The lion always stands on a larger coronet of the Heir, which then sits on a golden [[Helmet (heraldry)|helmet]] or the Royal Helm. From the sides flow the gold and [[Ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] [[mantling]] of the royal family.&lt;ref name="Official Web"/&gt;

====Supporters====
Similarly to the crest, the prince's [[supporter]]s follow those of the Sovereign. On either side of the shield of arms and standing on gold scrollwork are the royal supporters: the [[Lion and the Unicorn]]. Both beasts have the prince's label charged around their necks, again as an appropriate mark of difference. The [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]] on the [[Dexter and sinister|dexter side]], an [[National symbols of England|ancient symbol of England]], is crowned with the coronet of the Heir. The beast has been a [[Royal Supporters of England|supporter of the English royal arms]] since the reign of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. The white [[Unicorn#Heraldry|unicorn]] of [[Scotland]] on the [[Dexter and sinister|sinister side]], was incorporated into the royal arms from the [[Royal coat of arms of Scotland|Scottish royal arms]] after the Union of the crowns in 1603.&lt;ref name="Official Web"/&gt;

====Order====
Prince Charles was appointed a [[List of current members of the Order of the Garter|Knight of the Garter]] in 1958. Since the founding of the Order in 1348, almost every Prince of Wales has been appointed to the Order.&lt;ref&gt;Boutell p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Order of the Garter]] is represented in the coat of arms by its namesake the blue buckled [[Garter (stockings)|garter]], which bears in gold letters the motto, ''[[Honi soit qui mal y pense]]'', [[French language|French]] for "Shame upon him who thinks evil of it".&lt;ref name="Official Web"/&gt;

====Motto====
Under the coat of arms is a scroll bearing the [[motto]] ''[[Ich dien]]'', German for "I serve". The motto of uncertain origin first appeared on the arms of [[Edward, the Black Prince|Edward of Woodstock]], or the Black Prince. Prince Edward was created Prince of Wales by his father King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] on 12 May 1343. Legend holds that the Black Prince took the motto as well as the ostrich feathers from King [[John of Bohemia|John the Blind of Bohemia]], who was killed fighting alongside the prince and his father at the [[Battle of Crécy]] in 1346. The motto is also a near [[homophone]] for ''Eich Dyn'', "Your Man" in [[Welsh language|Welsh]].&lt;ref name="Official Web"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott-Giles p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prince of Wales as part of his full achievement of arms has many [[Heraldic badge]]s, which represents the history and sovereignty of his many titles.

====Prince of Wales' feathers====
{{Main|Prince of Wales's feathers}}
 
The Prince of Wales's feathers badge comprises "A plume of three [[ostrich]] feathers Argent enfiled by a royal coronet of alternate crosses and fleur-de-lys Or" with the motto 'Ich Dien' on a dark blue ribbon. The badge is probably the most recognisable element of the Prince of Wales's coat of arms. It has become synonymous as a personal insignia of the prince and also of the [[Principality of Wales]] itself.&lt;ref name="Official Web"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Feathers"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/titles-and-heraldry|title=Titles and Heraldry: Prince of Wales's Feathers |accessdate=2018-08-10 |work=Official website of the Prince of Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a personal capacity the badge is granted as a [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|Royal Warrant of Appointment]] to companies that regularly supply of goods and services to the Prince. Currently there are 170 companies which are entitled to display this badge with the words 'By Appointment to HRH The Prince of Wales' underneath. The badge can be depicted on all premises, delivery vehicles, stationery and advertisements as well as on the individual products themselves.&lt;ref name="Warrants"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/titles-and-heraldry |title=Titles and Heraldry: Royal Warrants |accessdate=2018-08-10 |work=Official website of the Prince of Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other organisations associated with Wales or the prince incorporate the badge into their own insignia including many Welsh regiments of the [[British Army]] (such as the [[Royal Regiment of Wales]]) and the [[Welsh Rugby Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott-Giles p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Feathers used as either a crest or a badge have been an [[Royal badges of England|ancient heraldic badge]] of the [[House of Plantagenet]]. However it was not until its incorporation into the heraldic achievements of the Black Prince that the feathers have become an omnipresent feature of the coats of arms of the Prince of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Scott-Giles pp. 89&amp;ndash;93&lt;/ref&gt;

====Red Dragon of Wales====
{{Main|Royal Badge of Wales}}
On 10 December 1901 a warrant signed by King [[Edward VII]] approved the addition of a badge of the [[Welsh Dragon|Red Dragon]] to the coat of arms of the Prince of Wales. The proclamation stated that: "on the sinister side a representation of the [[Royal badge of Wales|Badge of Wales]], namely, on a mount vert a Dragon, passant [[gules]], differenced (as in the Crest) with a label of three points argent." This was to complement the feathers badge, which was to be depicted on the dexter side of the prince's crest.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=27385 |date=10 December 1901 |page=8714 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Red Dragon, or ''Y Ddraig Goch'', has been a symbol associated with Wales since the time of [[Cadwaladr]], [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|King of Gwynedd]] in the 7th century. It was not until the beginning of the [[House of Tudor]] that the Red Dragon became a royal badge of the kings of England. Henry Tudor (later King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]) displayed the Dragon of Cadwaladr on his [[Royal standards of England|battle standard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.flaginstitute.org/pdfs/Robin%20Ashburner.pdf |title=Flags in Wales |last=Ashburner |first=Robin |date=2001 |website=flaginstitute.org |access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The red dragon became an official royal badge of the sovereign (representing Wales) according to a warrant issued in 1801. The warrant at the same time also confirmed the [[Tudor rose]] as a royal badge for England, the [[thistle]] for Scotland and the [[Celtic harp|golden harp]] for Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Pinces &amp; Pinces p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arms of the Duchy of Cornwall====
{{Main|Duke of Cornwall}}
The arms of the Duke of Cornwall are: "[[Sable (heraldry)|Sable]], fifteen [[bezant]]s, five, four, three, two and one." These arms were derived from those of [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall]], [[King of the Romans]], son and heir of King [[John, King of England|John]], who was also [[Count of Poitiers]] (or [[Poitou]]), represented by arms made up of [[pea]]s (poix) or [[gold coin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fox-Davis |first=Arthur Charles|authorlink=Arthur Charles Fox-Davies |title=The Book Of Public Arms.

Upon the accession of the prince's mother as Queen [[Elizabeth II]] on 6 February 1952, Prince Charles was automatically made the [[Duke of Cornwall]]. As such he is able to display the arms of the duchy on his coat of arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burke's Peerage|first= |authorlink=Burke's Peerage |title=Burke's guide to the Royal Family (Burke's genealogical series)|url=https://archive.org/details/burkesguidetoroy00lond/page/136 |year=1973 |publisher=Burke's Peerage; 1st edition |location=London |isbn=0220662223|pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; This title has been granted to every heir apparent since 17 March 1337, in accordance with a charter issued by King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] for Prince [[Edward the Black Prince]], his eldest son and heir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burke's Peerage|first= |authorlink=Burke's Peerage |title=Burke's genealogical and heraldic history of peerage, baronetage and knightage |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Pf8cAAAAYAAJ/page/n213 |year=1914 |publisher=Burke's Peerage |location=London |isbn=|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arms were first granted to Henry Stuart, the Duke of Rothesay after his father [[James I of England|James VI]] ascended the throne of England as James I. The arms were then granted twice more to the future Charles I and Charles II. It has been reported that James, the Duke of York (future James II) also bore the arms (despite not holding the title Prince of Wales), but only when his position as heir-presumptive to his brother became secure after the [[Exclusion Bill|Exclusion crisis]]. The arms were once more granted to James Francis Edward, who after 1688 became the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite Pretender]], whose son [[Charles Edward Stuart|Charles Edward]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie) continued the use of the arms in exile.&lt;ref&gt;Pinces &amp; Pinces pp. 170-189&lt;/ref&gt;

||The Royal arms were once again altered following the ascension of Queen [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]] to the throne in 1837, when the Hanoverian shield was dropped.

==Family==
===Consorts===
The family of the Prince of Wales is entitled to use certain heraldic features. The consort of the Prince of Wales (titled the [[Princess of Wales]]) is granted a unique coat of arms upon marriage, based on the [[Impalement (heraldry)|impaling]] of the prince's arms (on the dexter side) and her father's arms (on the sinister side). The consort is also entitled to use the prince's supporters (with the appropriate label) and the use of the prince's coronet over the arms.&lt;ref name="Boutell 363"/&gt; The current consort; [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|Camilla]], the [[Duchess of Cornwall]], was granted a coat of arms on 17 July 2005 upon her marriage to Charles, Prince of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/biographies/hrh-duchess-cornwall |title=HRH The Duchess of Cornwall: Titles and Heraldry |accessdate=2018-10-09 |work=Official website of the Prince of Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Boyd grew up in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]] and [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]],&lt;ref name=age/&gt; and attended [[Manheim Township High School]] from 1992–1996. According to her website, she was born Danah Michele Mattas.&lt;ref name="db_hompage_name"/&gt; Once she reached college, she chose to take her maternal grandfather's name, Boyd, as her own last name. She decided to spell her name in lowercase so as "to reflect my mother's original balancing and to satisfy my own political irritation at the importance of capitalization."&lt;ref name=age/&gt;&lt;ref name="db_hompage_name"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
After her parents' divorce, in 1982, she moved to [[York County, Pennsylvania|York]], [[Pennsylvania]], with her mother and her brother. Her mother married again during danah's third grade and the family moved to [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster, Pennsylvania]]. She used online discussions forums to escape from high school. She called Lancaster a "religious and conservative" city. Having had online discussions on the topic, she decided to start identifying as [[queer]].&lt;ref name="lemonde.fr"&gt;http://www.lemonde.fr/festival/article/2014/08/20/danah-boyd-anthropologue-de-la-generation-numerique_4473731_4415198.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years later, her brother taught her how to use [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] and [[Usenet]]. Even though she thought computers were "lame" at the time, the possibilities for connecting with others intrigued her. She became an avid participant on Usenet and IRC in her junior year in high school, spending a lot of time browsing, creating content, and conversing with strangers.&lt;ref name="danah.org"&gt;http://www.danah.org/aboutme.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Though active in many extra-curricular activities and excelling academically, boyd had a difficult time socially in high school. She assigns "her survival to her mother, the Internet, and a classmate whose misogynistic comments inspired her to excel."&lt;ref name="danah.org"/&gt;

Her initial ambition was to become an astronaut but after an injury, she became more interested in the Internet.&lt;ref name=age&gt;{{cite news|title=A space of her own – Encounter with Danah Boyd|work=The Age |location=Australia|date=August 4, 2007|author=Debelle, Penelope}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education ==
[[File:Danah Boyd.jpg|thumb|danah boyd in 2005, a speaker at Digital Identity conference in Chicago.]]
Boyd initially studied [[computer science]] at [[Brown University]], where she worked with [[Andries van Dam]] and wrote an undergraduate thesis about how "3-D computer systems used cues that were inherently sexist."&lt;ref name=age/&gt;  She pursued her master's degree in sociable media with [[Judith Donath]] at the [[MIT Media Lab]]. She worked for the New York-based activist organization [[V-Day (movement)|V-Day]], first as a volunteer (starting in 2004) and then as paid staff (2007–2009). She eventually moved to San Francisco, where she met the individuals involved in creating the new [[Friendster]] service. She documented what she was observing via her blog, and this grew into a career.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | work=The New York Times | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/27/technology/circuits/27frie.html | title=Decoding the New Cues in Online Society | last=Erard | first=Michael | date=November 27, 2003 | accessdate=May 22, 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604185643/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/27/technology/circuits/27frie.html | archivedate=June 4, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, boyd earned a [[Ph.D.]] at the [[UC Berkeley School of Information]],&lt;ref name="boydphd"&gt;{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=danah|last=boyd |title=Taken out of context: American teen sociality in networked publics|publisher=University of California, Berkeley |date=2008 |url=http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/e308t+2008+1093|authorlink=Danah boyd}}&lt;/ref&gt; advised by [[Peter Lyman]] (1940–2007) and [[Mizuko Ito]] (aka [[Mimi Ito]]). Her [[dissertation]], ''Taken Out of Context: American Teen Sociality in Networked Publics'', focused on the use of large social networking sites such as Facebook and MySpace by U.S. teenagers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/focus/antisemitism/voices/transcript/index.php?content=20091022 |title=Voices on Antisemtisim interview with danah boyd |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |date=2009-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505174453/http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/focus/antisemitism/voices/transcript/index.php?content=20091022 |archivedate=May 5, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was blogged on [[Boing Boing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2009/01/18/taken_out_of_co.html |title=Taken Out of Context – my PhD dissertation |work=zephoria.org |date=January 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://boingboing.net/2009/01/19/danah-boyds-phd-thes.html | title=danah boyd's PhD thesis: Teen sociality online | last=Doctorow | first=Cory | publisher=[[Boing Boing]] | accessdate=May 22, 2010 | date=January 19, 2009 | authorlink=Cory Doctorow }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2006–07 academic year, boyd was a fellow at the [[Annenberg Center for Communication]] at the [[University of Southern California]]. She was a long-time fellow at the [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]] at Harvard University, where she co-directed the Internet Safety Technical Task Force,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/research/isttf/members | accessdate=May 22, 2010 | title=Members of the Internet Safety Technical Task Force | publisher=[[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then served on the Youth and Media Policy Working Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/research/digitalnatives/policy|title=Youth and Media Policy Working Group Initiative|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Danah Boyd (12776738645).jpg|thumb|Visualisation from one of boyd's lectures by Willow Brugh]]
While in graduate school, she was involved with a three-year ethnographic project funded by the MacArthur Foundation and led by [[Mimi Ito]]; the project examined youths' use of technologies through interviews, focus groups, observations, and document analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitallearning.macfound.org/site/c.enJLKQNlFiG/b.4773555/k.27DE/Mizuko_Ito.htm |title=MacArthur Foundation Project Summary |accessdate=January 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalyouth.ischool.berkeley.edu/report |title=Final Report |work=The Digital Youth Project |accessdate=January 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her publications included an article in the ''MacArthur Foundation Series on Digital Learning, Identity Volume'' called "Why Youth (Heart) Social Network Sites: The Role of Networked Publics in Teenage Social Life."&lt;ref name=SocialNetwork&gt;{{cite journal |last=boyd |first=danah |editor1-first=David |editor1-last=Buckingham |editor1-link= |title=Why Youth (Heart) Social Network Sites: The Role of Networked Publics in Teenage Social Life |journal=Youth, Identity, and Digital Media |series=The John D. and Catherine T.

The project culminated with a co-authored book "Hanging Out, Messing Around, and Geeking Out: Kids Living and Learning with New Media."&lt;ref name="HangingOut"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ito |first=Mimi |title=Hanging Out, Messing Around, and Geeking Out: Kids Living and Learning with New Media |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |date=September 2009 |isbn=0-262-01336-3|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She published untraditional research on youth using Facebook and MySpace in 2007. She demonstrated that most young users of Facebook were white and middle-to-upper class, while MySpace users tended to be lower-class black teenagers. Her work is often translated and relayed to major media.&lt;ref name="lemonde.fr" /&gt; In addition to blogging on her own site, she addresses issues of youth and technology use on the [http://dmlcentral.net DMLcentral] blog. boyd has written academic papers and [[op-ed]] pieces on online culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shirky |first=Clay |authorlink=Clay Shirky |title=[[Here Comes Everybody]] |publisher=[[Penguin Group]] |date=February 28, 2008 |pages=224–5 |isbn=978-1-59420-153-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her career as a fellow at [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society|Harvard's Berkman Center]] started in 2007. In January 2009, boyd joined [[Microsoft Research]] New England, in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], as a Social Media Researcher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-10047795-36.html|title=Microsoft hires social-net scholar Danah Boyd|author=McCarthy, Caroline|date=September 22, 2008|publisher=[[CNET]]|accessdate=January 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, boyd founded [https://datasociety.net/ Data &amp; Society Research Institute] to address the social, technical, ethical, legal and policy issues that are emerging from data-centric technological development.

She was interviewed in the 2015 web documentary about internet privacy, ''[[Do Not Track (documentary)|Do Not Track]]''.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/14/brett-gaylor-do-not-track-interactive-documentary-privacy|title=Do not Track: an online, interactive documentary about who’s watching you|last=Davis|first=Nicola|date=14 April 2015|work=The Guardian|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, boyd is president of [[Data &amp; Society]],&lt;ref&gt;https://datasociety.net&lt;/ref&gt; a Principal Researcher at [[Microsoft Research]] and a Visiting Professor at [[New York University]].

'''The East Side Kids''' were characters in a series of films released by [[Monogram Pictures]] from 1940 through 1945.  Many of them were originally part of [[Dead End Kids|The Dead End Kids]] and [[Little Tough Guys|The Little Tough Guys]], and several of them later became members of [[The Bowery Boys]].

==History==
{{main|Dead End Kids}}
When [[Samuel Goldwyn]] turned the play ''[[Dead End (play|Dead End]]'' into the [[Dead End (1937 film)|1937 film version]], he recruited the original tough-talking kids from the play ([[Leo Gorcey]], [[Huntz Hall]], [[Bobby Jordan]], [[Gabriel Dell]], [[Billy Halop]], and [[Bernard Punsly]]) to repeat their roles in the film. This led to the making of six other films starring [[The Dead End Kids]]. The most successful of these features were ''[[Angels with Dirty Faces]]'' (1938) with [[James Cagney]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]], and ''[[They Made Me a Criminal]]'' (1939), starring [[John Garfield]]. Universal offered a competing series, under the [[Little Tough Guys]] brand name, later combining the Little Tough Guys cast members with the Dead End Kids (minus Gorcey) as the Dead End Kids and Little Tough Guys series.

==The East Side Kids==
In 1940 producer [[Sam Katzman]], noting the financial success of other tough-kid series,  made the film ''[[East Side Kids (film)|East Side Kids]]'' using two of the 'Little Tough Guys', Hally Chester and Harris Berger. He added former [[Our Gang]] player [[Donald Haines]], [[Frankie Burke]], radio actor Sam Edwards, and Eddie Brian to round out the new team. The film served as a kind of "pilot" for a possible series of films, which were eventually made possible by this film's success.

Katzman hired former Dead End Kid Bobby Jordan to play the lead in the first film in the series proper, ''[[Boys of the City]]'' and he was soon joined in the series by Leo Gorcey. Gorcey's brother David was also added, as well as (Ernie) [[Ernie Morrison|'Sunshine' Sammy Morrison]] as "Scruno," the only African-American in the group and a former child actor from the very first cast of the [[Our Gang]] comedy team.

In the first few films, [[Dave O'Brien (actor)|Dave O'Brien]] (familiar from low-budget westerns and serials, and as the accident-prone star of the [[Pete Smith Specialties|Pete Smith]] comedies) played Jordan's older brother ''Knuckles Dolan,'' who always seemed to be getting roped into chaperoning the kids from adventure to adventure. O'Brien appeared in different roles as well—continuity between films was often ignored. As with the Little Tough Guys, the membership of the team changed from film to film, until Huntz Hall joined in 1941, when the lineup was somewhat stabilized. In total, 20 actors were members of the team at one time or another.

[[File:Million Dollar Kid (1944) 1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Bobby Stone]], [[Robert Greig]], [[Leo Gorcey]], and [[Huntz Hall]] in the film ''[[Million Dollar Kid]]'' (1944).]]
Always the outsider, Gabriel Dell drifted in and out of the series as a gang-member, a reporter, or a small-time hoodlum (as in ''Million Dollar Kid''). In ''Smart Alecks'' he's an ex-member who left the gang to pursue a life of crime. [[Stanley Clements]] also appeared in ''Smart Alecks'' as well as '''Neath Brooklyn Bridge'' and ''Ghosts on the Loose''. After Gorcey left the subsequent "Bowery Boys" series in 1956, Clements was chosen to replace him in the last seven films.

Monogram (which later became Allied Artists) was notorious for its "[[Poverty Row]]" productions, and the East Side films were no exception. With a minuscule budget of around $33,000 per feature and a tight shooting schedule of only 5–7 days, the series churned out three or four movies a year (an astonishing 21 films in less than six years). There was no time or money for subtlety, story development, or more than one or two takes per scene.

The stories always centered on the tough, pugnacious "Muggs McGinnis" (Gorcey) or the more innocent, clean-cut "Danny" (Bobby Jordan). Huntz Hall's "Glimpy" began as a minor character who grew in prominence as he was allowed to do more comedy bits over the course of the series. The loose format proved flexible enough to shift back and forth between urban drama (''That Gang of Mine''), murder mystery (''Boys of the City''), boxing melodrama (''Bowery Blitzkrieg''), and horror-comedy (''Spooks Run Wild''), with the kids confronting various stock villains: gangsters, smugglers, spies, and crooked gamblers, along the way. The East Side films were problem-teen melodramas until 1943, when director [[William Beaudine]] joined the series and emphasized the comedy content. He encouraged the actors to improvise freely, adding to the films' spontaneous charm.

The contemporaneous events of World War II affected the series as well as the cast.  In 1943 Béla Lugosi (who was in ''Spooks Run Wild'') returned as a Nazi saboteur in the incongruously-titled ''Ghosts on the Loose'' which also featured a young [[Ava Gardner]]; a German-Japanese spy ring was thwarted in the blatantly patriotic ''[[Let's Get Tough!]]'' from 1942 (with Gabriel Dell, of all people, as a Nazi spy). At the end of ''[[Kid Dynamite (film)|Kid Dynamite]]'' Muggs, Danny, and Glimpy enlist and show off their uniforms. In ''Follow The Leader'' (1944), Muggs and Glimpy appear in uniform as they are on leave from the Army. Offscreen, between 1942 and 1944, cast members [[Billy Benedict]], Morrison, Jordan, Dell, and David Gorcey left the series after being drafted. A few days after receiving ''his'' induction notice, Leo Gorcey suffered a near-fatal motorcycle accident and spent almost a year in recovery. His injuries led to a 4-F classification, rendering him unfit for military service.

During Bobby Jordan's absence, his role in the series was taken by former child actor David Durand. Durand had been the star of Columbia's series of "Glove Slingers" campus comedies, and lent the same earnest sincerity to his East Side Kids appearances. (Jordan returned in 1944, in uniform, for a guest appearance in ''Bowery Champs''.)

Starting with ''Clancy Street Boys'' in 1943, Bernard Gorcey (Leo's father) did various bit parts, playing different characters in a total of seven films. In ''Million Dollar Kid'' he and Leo exchanged banter borrowed from an Abbott and Costello routine. He later became a fixture with [[The Bowery Boys]].

Given the low budgets, simplistic stories, and crude, assembly-line production of the East Side Kids series, its enduring popularity relies on the cast's rambunctious energy, breezy banter (often ad-libbed and containing inside jokes), fast-paced action, and Leo Gorcey's trademark [[malapropism|malapropisms]] ("This calls for drastic measurements").

The East Side Kids series was supplanted by [[The Bowery Boys]] in 1946.

The council of '''Eight Men''' was an early representational democracy in [[New Netherland]]. It replaced the previous [[Twelve Men]] and was followed by the [[Nine Men]].

==Council==
In 1643 [[Abraham Pietersen Van Deusen]] who had served on the [[council of twelve men]] was appointed to a new council of eight men. The council contacted the [[Estates-General of the Netherlands|States-General]] and blamed governor [[Willem Kieft]] for the declining economic condition of the nascent colony, and the [[Kieft's War|war]] with the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. They requested that a new [[Director-General of New Netherland]] be appointed and that the people themselves be given more influence in the new government. Director General Kieft was dismissed, and [[Peter Stuyvesant]] took his place and Stuyvesant remained in power until the colony was turned over to the British in 1664. Kieft returned to Holland, but the vessel, the [[Princess Amelia (1634 ship)|''Princess Amelia'']] was lost at sea and his body was never recovered. John Franklin Jameson (1859–1937) writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The commonalty were called together; they were sore distressed. They chose eight, in the stead of the previous twelve, persons to aid in consulting for the best; but the occupation every one had to take care of his own, prevented anything beneficial being adopted at that time. nevertheless it was resolved that as many Englishmen as were to be got in the country should be enlisted, who were indeed now proposing to depart; the third part of these were to be paid by the commonalty; this promise was made by the commonalty but was not followed by the pay.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1643 a minor altercation with Indians evolved into a serious uprising followed by an ugly slaughter of Weckquaskeek Indians on Manhattan Island. Kieft feared a major Indian assault. Allerton was asked by Kieft to join a "group of 8 men" to help New Amsterdam. Because he was English and respected in New Haven, Kieft sent Allerton and another Englishman to New Haven in 1643 to ask for men and materials to help defend New Amsterdam. In addition, the "group of 8" was asked to propose measures to improve civility and law-and-order in New Amsterdam. New Haven refused to send men to support the Dutch but Kieft entered into an agreement with the Indians in 1645 that settled the dispute. Because of Kieft's dictatorial manner, several of the eight men petitioned the WIC directors to recall Kieft as Director-General. In time Kieft was replaced by Peter Stuyvesant, and the men initiating the recall petition were accused of insurrection and faced punishment. Allerton was the second signatory of the petition but was not the group's primary spokesman. In 1646, Allerton established a permanent residence in New Haven.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ethel Wood''' (16 January 1901 – 19 August 2011) was a [[Guernsey]] [[supercentenarian]]. At the age of 110, Wood was the ninth-oldest verified person who died in the United Kingdom following the death of 112-year-old [[Margaret Fish]] on 12 March 2011. Wood was not born in the United Kingdom, since Guernsey is a [[Crown dependencies|crown-dependency]], and legally never part of the Kingdom of England or the the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmjust/56/5604.htm |title=Crown Dependencies – Justice Committee |website=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] |date=30 March 2010 |accessdate=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
.

==Biography==

Ethel Wood was born in [[Saint Sampson, Guernsey]]. She was one of five children born to William and Lily Wood. Wood trained as a teacher in London prior to the [[German occupation of the Channel Islands|German occupation of Guernsey]]. Like her siblings, she never married or had children.

She moved to Essex in the 1990s to care for her younger sister, Edith. Wood lived in her own home until breaking her leg during a fall a month before her 110th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/local/clacton/8797400.Ethel__aged_110__says___I_don_t_feel_any_different_/ "Ethel, aged 110, says: "I don't feel any different""], ''Daily Gazette'' ([[Clacton-on-Sea|Clacton]], Frinton and Walton), 18 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eadt.co.uk/news/essex-amazing-ethel-celebrates-her-110th-birthday-1-776944|title=Essex: ‘Amazing’ Ethel celebrates her 110th birthday|first=By Chris|last=Harris|publisher=|accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethel died suddenly on 19 August 2011, aged 110 years, 215 days in England. If she had lived until December of that year, she would have surpassed the only other supercententenarian from Guernsey, [[Margaret Ann Neve]] (1792–1903).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25993">[[File:Facebook_-_Update_Your_Name_notification.jpg|thumb|right|[[Facebook]]'s [[Facebook features#Notification|notification]] to "update your name"]]

The '''Facebook real-name policy controversy''' refers to the controversy over [[Social networking service|social networking]] site [[Facebook]]{{'}}s "[[real-name system]]" dictating how people register their accounts and configure their [[user profile]]s.  The controversy stems from a policy that those who have been adversely affected describe as penalizing users who are in fact using their real names which Facebook has nevertheless deemed to be "fake", while simultaneously allowing anyone to create fake yet plausible-sounding names, as well as obviously implausible-sounding names comprising word combinations that Facebook's software fails to recognize as unlikely to be real because their alleged nonstandard spelling or confusion with fictional characters. Facebook furthermore prohibits users from accurately representing names which according to the site have "too many words", and prohibits initializing first names, preventing users who do so in real life from formatting their own names as they see fit.

== Background ==
The social networking website [[Facebook]] has maintained the [[real-name system]] policy for user profiles.  According to Facebook, the real-name policy stems from the position "that way, you always know who you're connecting with. This helps keep our community safe."&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/16/living/facebook-name-policy/ |title=Facebook 'real name' policy stirs questions around identity |last=Grinberg |first=Emanuella |date=September 18, 2014 |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Facebook"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/help/112146705538576|title=What names are allowed on Facebook?|last=|first=|date=|publisher=[[Facebook]] |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise per this policy, a "real name" is defined by "your real name as it would be listed on your credit card, driver's license or student ID."&lt;ref name="Business Insider"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-apologizes-for-real-name-policy-2014-10|title=Facebook Apologizes For 'Real Name' Policy That Forced Drag Queens To Change Their Profiles|last=Levy|first=Karyne|date=October 1, 2014|work=[[Business Insider]] |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, Facebook estimated that more than 83&amp;nbsp;million Facebook accounts are fake accounts.&lt;ref name="usa"&gt;{{cite news |title=Facebook: About 83 million accounts are fake |work=[[USA Today]] |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/story/2012-08-03/cnbc-facebook-fake-accounts/56759964/1 |accessdate=August 4, 2012 |date=August 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this revelation, the share price of Facebook dropped below $20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Facebook share price slumps below $20 amid fake account flap |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/02/facebook-share-price-slumps-20-dollars |accessdate=August 4, 2012 |location=London |first=Dominic |last=Rushe |date=August 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook has asserted that "authentic identity is important to the Facebook experience, and our goal is that every account on Facebook should represent a real person."&lt;ref name="usa" /&gt;

==Affected users==

===Ethnic groups===

====Native Americans====
[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] have been repeatedly targeted due to Facebook's policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holpuck|first1=Amanda|title=Facebook still suspending Native Americans over 'real name' policy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/16/facebook-real-name-policy-suspends-native-americans|accessdate=6 March 2015|publisher=Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Robin Kills The Enemy, a resident of the [[Sioux]] Rosebud reservation in South Dakota, found that when she tried to register her surname in its normal format, the site would not let her use them, so she resorted to combining the three words, spelling them as one word.  After having been a member for some time, she eventually contacted the site in an attempt to have her surname spelled as it actually is in real life.  However, after reaching out to Facebook, they instead deactivated her account without explanation.  When she was finally able to make contact with an actual employee, they wrote back telling her "Fake names are a violation of our Terms of Use. Facebook requires users to provide their full first and last names".  She eventually managed to have her account reinstated; however, users with the surname Kills The Enemy are, as of 2015, still required by Facebook to spell their surname without spaces as a single word.&lt;ref name=ictmn&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramos|first1=Nestor|title=Facebook no friend to American Indian names |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2009/02/16/facebook-no-friend-american-indian-names-82895|website=Indian Country Today media network}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Shane Creepingbear, an Oklahoman member of the [[Kiowa]] tribe, reported that he had been "kicked off" of Facebook on [[Columbus Day]] for having a supposedly fake name.&lt;ref name=metroCreepingbear&gt;{{cite web|last1=McAteer|first1=Ollie|title=Native Americans booted off Facebook for having ‘fake’ names like Creepingbear|url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/02/11/native-americans-booted-off-facebook-for-having-fake-names-like-creepingbear-5057955/|website=Metro}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Lance Brown Eyes, an [[Oglala Lakota|Oglala]], found that his account had been suspended; when he was able to send in documentation to Facebook proving his identity, Facebook reinstated his account, but changed his name to "Lance Brown".&lt;ref name=IBT&gt;{{cite web|last1=Russon|first1=Mary-Ann|title=Facebook fail: Native Americans keep being accused of using fake names|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/facebook-fail-native-americans-keep-being-accused-using-fake-names-1487378|website=International Business Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Dana Lone Hill, a member of the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] tribe who had been a registered Facebook user for several years, discovered one day that she had been locked out of her account.  A message from Facebook said "it looks like the name on your Facebook account may not be your authentic name".  After a week, during which she had to send in her personal documentation to Facebook, her account access was restored.  She has since threatened a class-action lawsuit on behalf of Native Americans against Facebook due to how it exercises its name policies.

A number of Native Americans have objected to Facebook's inquiries into their names, and to Facebook's request that they provide proof of identification or other documentation in order to use the service.&lt;ref name="The Washington Post"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Phillip| first1=Abby| title=Online ‘authenticity’ and how Facebook's ‘real name’ policy hurts Native Americans | date=October 2, 2014|accessdate=October 5, 2015|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/02/10/online-authenticity-and-how-facebooks-real-name-policy-hurts-native-americans/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native American activists claimed to be planning to file a [[class action lawsuit]] against Facebook regarding the 'real name' policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holpuck|first1=Amanda|title=Native American activist to sue Facebook over site's 'real name' policy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/19/native-american-activist-facebook-lawsuit-real-name|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|work=The Guardian|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japanese====
In 2008, a woman in Japan named Hiroko Yoda had her Facebook account suspended over her [[Yoda_(disambiguation)|surname]], which is common in Japan, being confused with a [[Star Wars]] character of the [[Yoda|same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2632170/Woman-called-Yoda-blocked-from-Facebook.html|title=Woman called Yoda blocked from Facebook|first=Matthew|last=Moore|date=27 August 2008|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Irish====
The [[Dublin]] branch of the [[Irish language]] rights group, Misneach, started a [[Change.org]] [[online petition]] to demand the right to use Irish names on Facebook and protested outside Facebook's European headquarters in Dublin on October 7, 2015.&lt;ref name="Irish Times"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/protest-at-dublin-facebook-hq-over-real-name-policy-1.2345414 |title=Protest at Dublin Facebook HQ over ‘real-name’ policy |last=Tracer |first=Dan |date=September 9, 2015 |work=[[Irish Times]] |accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scottish Gaelic====
In 2015, one Gaelic-speaking retired policeman won the right to use his Gaelic name on Facebook, even though it was not his legal name. Some Scottish Gaelic surnames, such as NicIllAnndrais, contain more than two capital letters and are still disallowed by Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man wins Facebook battle over ‘fake’ Gaelic name|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/odd/man-wins-facebook-battle-over-fake-gaelic-name-1-3702815|date=26 February 2015|website=www.scotsman.com|accessdate=31 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chamoru====
In the Spanish-influenced indigenous [[Chamoru]] culture of the [[Marianas]], the standard naming convention has historically been for a person to use their mother's [[maiden name]] as their middle name. (Chamoru culture, having been colonized by Spain, went through a period where indigenous names and naming conventions were forcibly eradicated and replaced by what the conquering Spanish deemed acceptable.) Furthermore, using one's full name rather than simply the first and last is commonplace, if only for disambiguation purposes due to a relatively small pool of surnames. Therefore, middle names such as De Leon Guerrero and De La Cruz are frequently encountered. However, attempting to register such names as one's middle name results in a message telling users that "Names can't have too many words." Therefore, many Chamoru users are forced to either run all of the words together as if they were one single word, or to initialize each word to a common acronym such as DLG or DLC.

In cases where the acronym is employed, Facebook automatically changes to lower-case all letters except the first. (Use of periods, e.g. D.L.G., will result in a message telling users that "Profile names can't have too many periods.") Therefore, someone commonly known in real life by a name such as Mary De Leon Guerrero Mafnas would have to resort to using what on Facebook would end up being "Mary Dlg Mafnas". The message is not accompanied by an option to challenge/appeal the restriction or to send Facebook documentation that the format is how one normally formats their name in real life.

====Vietnamese====
In January 2015, a 23-year-old Australian bank employee claiming to be named Phuc Dat Bich posted a photo of his passport identification page to Facebook, protesting that the company had unfairly shut down his account for being "false and misleading".&lt;ref name=BBCBich&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-34897404|title=Phuc Dat Bich: Australian with 'misleading' name thanks supporters|date=November 23, 2015|accessdate=November 23, 2015|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Is it because I'm Asian? Is it?" he asked. The BBC reported that in Vietnamese the name is pronounced similarly to "Phoo Da Bi" (IPA: [[Help:IPA/Vietnamese|{{ipa|/fukp˦˥ ɗat˩ ɓic˦˥/}}]]).&lt;ref name=BBCBich/&gt; After his reinstatement, Bich posted a thank you note to supportive Facebook fans, stating he was "glad and honoured to be able to make people happy by simply making them laugh at something that appears outrageous and ridiculous".&lt;ref name=BBCBich/&gt; Subsequently "Phuc Dat" published a further message admitting it was a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Phuc Dat Bich admits hoax in Facebook name battle|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-34918491|accessdate=25 November 2015|publisher=BBC|date=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tamils====
Tamils do not have surnames: They have their father or mother or both father and mother's first name as initials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://bumpahead.net/tamil-name-structure-10dd63730563|title=Tamil name structure… |author=moulee|date=19 July 2009|publisher=bumpahead.net|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This standard naming practice has not been acknowledged by Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/facebook-should-scrap-its-regressive-real-names-policy/article7797302.ece|title=Really harassed by Facebook’s ‘real names’|author=G. Sampath|date=24 October 2015|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=15 April 2018|via=www.thehindu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transgender users===
Facebook's real-name policy does not reflect adopted names or [[pseudonym]]s used by the [[transgender]] community, and has led to suspending users with real names that might be thought to be fake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press| url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2009-05-25/business/20872135_1_accounts-with-fake-names-facebook-facebook-guidelines-and-features|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|first=Barbara|last=Ortutay|date=May 25, 2009|title=Real users caught in Facebook fake-name purge|accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A user via the anonymous [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] app [[Secret (app)|Secret]] began reporting "fake names" which caused user profiles to be suspended, specifically targeting the [[stage name]]s of [[drag queen]]s.&lt;ref name="Business Insider"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holpuck|first1=Amanda|title=Facebook still freezing accounts despite apology to drag queens over 'real names.'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/17/facebook-still-freezing-accounts-despite-apology-drag-queens-real-names|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transgender people have also been affected by the policy, including one former Facebook employee who initiated development on Facebook's custom gender options, who was suspended on the day the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in ''[[Obergefell v.

=== Users target of religious persecution ===
Secular, atheist, agnostic, humanist, or users who comment or blog expressing views critical of particular religions, sects or religion in general, as well as religious people who express the opposing views critical of atheism or agnosticism very often have a legitimate need to use an alias. Some of these users could suffer rejection, retaliation or violence if their views – contrary to those of their family, friends or community – are known. In some cases, secular bloggers are exposed to imprisonment by an intolerant government, violent attacks in the street or even being killed by religious fanatics. Examples are the incarceration of activist and blogger [[Raif Badawi]] in Saudi Arabia and a string of attacks and murders of secular activists in [[Attacks by Islamic extremists in Bangladesh|Bangladesh]] or Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/abdullah-sharif/pakistans-religious-extremism_b_9577338.html|title=Pakistan's Religious Extremism: A World Menace|first=Abdullah|last=Sharif|date=1 April 2016|website=huffingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reaction ==
International non-profit [[digital rights]] group [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] stated they were "alarmed to hear that Facebook's 'real name' policy is disproportionately affecting the LGBTQ community."&lt;ref name="EFF"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/09/facebooks-real-name-policy-can-cause-real-world-harm-lgbtq-community |title=Facebook's 'Real Name' Policy Can Cause Real-World Harm for the LGBTQ Community |last1=Kayyali |last2=York |first1=Nadia |first2=Jillian |date=September 16, 2014 |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Online magazine]] ''[[Queerty]]'' called Facebook's policy "a frankly creepy overreach of authority", adding "There are a million reasons why someone would choose to self-identify with a name other than the one that's printed on their birth certificate. And really, it's absolutely none of your business in the first place."&lt;ref name="Queerty"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.queerty.com/facebook-targeting-drag-queens-forcing-them-to-use-their-legal-names-20140911 |title=Facebook Targeting Drag Queens, Forcing Them To Use Their Legal Names |last=Tracer |first=Dan |date=September 11, 2014 |work=[[Queerty]] |accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview for MAGE Magazine, Second Life entrepreneur Jennifer Ceara Firehawk stated: "If we are not using our page to abuse or grief others they just need to leave us be. We are not hurting anyone…  FB does not realize some SL people earn lindens to turn into RL (real life) money and that is how they make a living. Once you force a person to change the SL name they will lose money due to not being able to find them on FB or SL as they may use FB for their buisness [sic] or advertise. So they end up losing buisness [sic] and money."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://0zymandius.wix.com/magemagazine#!September-18-The-Day-F-Book-killed-the-King-Part-1/c112t/55fc2bae0cf256c0bf936f60|title=The Day F Book killed the King : Part 1|date=September 18, 2015|first=Ian|last=Thomson|magazine=MAGE Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Compromise to protect those with special circumstances  ==
On December 15, 2015, Facebook announced in a press release&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/12/community-support-fyi-improving-the-names-process-on-facebook/|title=Community Support FYI: Improving the Names Process on Facebook |last1=Osofsky |first1=Jason |last2=Gage |first2=Todd |date=December 15, 2015 |website=Facebook Newsroom |publisher=Facebook |access-date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it would be providing a compromise to its real name policy after protests from groups such as the gay/lesbian community and abuse victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/facebook-modifies-real-names-policy-testing-use-of-assumed-names-1.2702400 |title=Facebook modifies 'real names' policy, testing use of assumed names |last=AFP |date=December 16, 2015 |website=CTV News |publisher=Bell Media |access-date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is developing a protocol that will allow members to provide specifics as to their "special circumstance" or "unique situation" with a request to use pseudonyms, subject to verification of their true identities. At that time, this was already being tested in the U.S. Product manager Todd Gage and vice president of global operations Justin Osofsky also promised a new method for reducing the number of members who must go through ID verification while ensuring the safety of others on Facebook. The fake name reporting procedure will also be modified, forcing anyone who makes such an allegation to provide specifics that would be investigated and giving the accused individual time to dispute the allegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/15/facebook-change-controversial-real-name-policy?subid=17310058&amp;CMP=EMCNEWEML6619I2 |title=Facebook changes controversial 'real name' policy in wake of criticism  |last1=Holpuch |first1=Amanda |date=December 15, 2015 |website=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |access-date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This measure was criticised by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who pointed out that it forces the most vulnerable users to reveal intimate details of their personal lives. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/changes-facebooks-real-names-policy-still-dont-fix-problem|title=Changes to Facebook’s "Real Names" Policy Still Don’t Fix the Problem}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, as of January 2018, there is no evidence in Facebook's policies that this measure was ever implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/help/229715077154790?helpref=related|title=What other names are allowed on Facebook?|publisher=Facebook|access-date=May 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Plaque on the Graves of the Forgotten Ten.jpg|thumb|Plaque placed by the Irish Government on the graves of the Volunteers]]
The '''Forgotten Ten''' ({{lang-ga|An Deichniúr Dearmadta}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wn.com/the_forgotten_ten__an_deichni%C3%BAr_dearmadta_part_1|title=The Forgotten Ten An Deichniúr Dearmadta Part 1|work=World News|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the term applied to ten members of the [[Irish Republican Army]] who were executed in [[Mountjoy Prison]], [[Dublin]] by British forces following [[court martial|courts martial]] from 1920–21 during the [[Irish War of Independence]].

Based upon military law at the time, they were buried within the prison precincts, their graves unmarked in the [[Consecration|unconsecrated ground]].  The names of the Forgotten Ten are [[Kevin Barry]], [[Patrick Moran (Irish republican)|Patrick Moran]], [[Frank Flood]], [[Thomas Whelan]], [[Thomas Traynor]], [[Patrick Doyle (Irish republican)|Patrick Doyle]], [[Edmond Foley]], Thomas Bryan, Bernard Ryan, and Patrick Maher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.ie/history.htm A Brief History Of The National Graves Association] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120173433/http://www.nga.ie/history.htm |date=November 20, 2007 }}, nga.ie; accessed 19 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign for reburial==
Following the [[Irish War of Independence]], Mountjoy Prison was transferred to the control of the [[Irish Free State]], which became the State of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] in 1937. In the 1920s, the families of the dead men requested their remains be returned to them for proper burial. This effort was joined in the later 1920s by the [[National Graves Association]].  Through the efforts of the Association, the graves of the men were identified in 1934, and in 1996 a [[Celtic cross]] was erected in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]] to commemorate them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.ie/history.htm Source 1. above] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120173433/http://www.nga.ie/history.htm |date=November 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State funeral==
[[Image:The Forgotten Ten.jpg|thumb|The grave of nine of the Forgotten Ten in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin]]
The campaign to rebury the men dragged on for 80 years from their deaths. Following an intense period of negotiations, the Irish government relented. Plans to exhume the bodies of the 10 men were announced on 1 November 2000, the 80th anniversary of the execution of Kevin Barry. On 14 October 2001, the Forgotten Ten were afforded full state honours, with a private service at Mountjoy Prison for the families of the dead, a [[requiem mass]] at [[St Mary's Pro-Cathedral]] and burial in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', 15 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', some criticised the event as glorifying militant [[Irish republicanism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/oct/15/northernireland.ireland Dublin State Funeral for IRA Men], Guardian.co.uk; accessed 1 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It coincided with the [[Fianna Fáil]] [[Ardfheis|party conference]].&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/oct/15/northernireland.ireland|title=Dublin state funeral for IRA men|author=Rosie Cowan|work=the Guardian|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The progress of the cortège through the centre of Dublin was witnessed by crowds estimated as being in the tens of thousands who broke into spontaneous applause as the coffins passed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ireland/1359518/Ahern-defends-1921-IRA-men's-state-funeral.html Ahern defends 1921 IRA men's state funeral ] 14 Oct 2001 Telegraph.co.uk : Accessed 1 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; On [[O'Connell Street]], a lone piper played a lament as the cortege paused outside the [[General Post Office (Dublin)|General Post Office]], the focal point of the 1916 [[Easter Rising]].&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; In his homily during the requiem mass, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Cahal Daly]], a long-time critic of [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|the IRA campaign]] in [[Northern Ireland]], insisted that there was a clear distinction between the conflict of 1916–22 and the paramilitary-led violence of the previous 30 years:

{{quote|
The true inheritors today of the ideals of the men and women of 1916 to 1922 are those who are explicitly and visibly committed to leaving the physical force tradition behind... Surely this state funeral can be an occasion for examination of conscience about the ideals of the men who died, and about our responsibility for translating those ideals into today's realities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06EFDD113FF936A25753C1A9679C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all Irish Rebury 10 Republicans Hanged by British in 1920s], New York Times; accessed 1 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his graveside oration the [[Taoiseach]] [[Bertie Ahern]] echoed these sentiments and also paid tribute to the Ten:{{quote|These 10 young men were executed during the War of Independence. The country was under tremendous pressure at the time. There was a united effort. Meanwhile, elected by the people, Dáil Éireann was developing, in spite of a war going on. Democracy was being put to work. Independent civic institutions, including the Dáil courts, were beginning to function. Before their deaths, the ten had seen the light of freedom. They understood that Ireland would be free and independent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage.eircom.net/~dankiely/pressreleases.html PRESS RELEASE: 17 October 2001], eircom.net; accessed 1 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In accordance with his wishes, and those of his family, he was reinterred in [[Ballylanders]], [[County Limerick]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/index.asp?locID=383&amp;docID=511 Patrick Maher reference] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202182547/http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/index.asp?locID=383&amp;docID=511 |date=December 2, 2007 }}, taoiseach.gov.ie; accessed 19 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

A feature length [[Irish language]] documentary on the re-interments, ''An Deichniúr Dearmadta'' (''The Forgotten Ten'') aired on [[TG4]] on 28 March 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2003marapr/biff.html|title=Harvard Film Archive|work=harvard.edu|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/irishfilm/showfilm.php?fid=51577|title=Irish Film &amp; TV Research Online - Trinity College Dublin|work=tcd.ie|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An episode of the BBC series ''[[Who Do You Think You Are? (UK TV series)|Who Do you Think You Are?]]'' with [[Boy George]] describes the life of Thomas Bryan, who was his great uncle.

'''Geert Adriaans Boomgaard''' (21 September 1788 &amp;ndash; 3 February 1899) was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[supercentenarian]]. He is accepted as the first validated supercentenarian case on record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grg.org/Adams/A.HTM |title=Table A - Verified Supercentenarians (Listed Chronologically By Birth Date)|accessdate=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grg.org/Gallery/Pre1850sGallery.html Gerontology Research Group&lt;/ref&gt; Since there is evidence that he served as a soldier in [[Napoleon]]'s [[Grande Armée]], in the 33rd Light Infantry Division, Boomgaard might in fact have been the oldest military veteran ever for several decades.&lt;ref name="derniersveterans.free.fr"&gt;[http://derniersveterans.free.fr/napoleon1.html Derniers vétérans de l'Armée napoléonienne, Premier Empire] {{fr-icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2016}}

==Life==
[[File:GeertAdriaansBoomgaard.jpg|thumb|left|Boomgaard later in life, in the 1890s]]
Little is known about Boomgaard's life. He was born in [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]], Netherlands, where he also died. His parents were Adriaan Jacobs Boomgaard (1763-1844) and Geesje Geerts Bontekoe (1762-1834).&lt;ref name="delpher"&gt;[http://www.delpher.nl/nl/kranten/view?query=Geert+Adriaans+Boomgaard&amp;coll=ddd&amp;identifier=ddd:011010387:mpeg21:a0422&amp;resultsidentifier=ddd:011010387:mpeg21:a0422 Nieuwsblad van het Noorden, 3 April 1982]&lt;/ref&gt; His father was captain on a boat, and civil records say that Geert did the same work.&lt;ref name=wiewaswie1&gt;[https://www.wiewaswie.nl/personen-zoeken/zoeken/document/a2apersonid/163990124/srcid/18794926/oid/31]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=November 2016}} Other sources&lt;ref name="derniersveterans.free.fr"/&gt; say that he had also served as a soldier in the 33rd Light Infantry Regiment in [[Napoleon]]'s [[Grande Armée]].

At the age of 29, on 4 March 1818, he married Stijntje Bus (baptized 19 February 1797 - died 24 March 1830&lt;ref name="delpher" /&gt;).&lt;ref name="wiewaswie1"/&gt; Stijntje died aged 33, a month after the birth of their 8th child. A year later, 17 March 1831, Boomgaard married Grietje Abels Jonker (baptized 19 May 1793 - 18 May 1864&lt;ref name="delpher" /&gt;), with whom he had four more children, for a total of 12. His last surviving child, Jansje Hinderika, died at the age of 57 in May 1885.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Boomgaard died at age 110 years 135 days in Groningen.

==Evidence==
{{Original research section|date=November 2016}}
Research on Boomgaard was published in three articles by E.J. Heeres in the genealogical periodical ''Gruoninga'' in 1976, 1977 and 1978. The website http://www.stehelene.org, which is dedicated to the rebuilding of the lost archives on the Médaille de Sainte-Hélène, shows his photograph, his (presumed) personal Sainte-Hélène medal, and a certificate which states that "Adriaans, Gerrit, à Groningue, Pays-Bas, received this medal" on behalf of his active military service during the reign of [[Napoleon I]]. The certificate is registered at la Grande Chancellerie No. 1871, and bears the stamped signature of the Duc de Plaisance Général {{ill|Anne-Charles Lebrun|fr}}, Grand Chancelier (1853&amp;ndash;1859).

'''Hans Heiling''' (Jan Svatoš in [[Czech language|Czech]]) is a legendary person in [[Germany|German]] and [[Bohemia]]n mythology.

The stories originate from German inhabitants of [[Loket (Sokolov District)|Loket]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]). The son of a water fairy from the river [[Ohře]], who taught him to master magic and command spirits. Once he had become rich and powerful, he ordered the spirits under his command to build a great city. The granite rocks above the Ohře, named [[Hans-Heiling-Felsen]] (Svatošské Skály in Czech), were believed to be the ruins of this city.&lt;ref name="cz"&gt;[http://www.cot.cz/zobrazcl.php?id=5492 COT.cz tourism site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011002443/http://www.cot.cz/zobrazcl.php?id=5492 |date=2007-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Hans Heiling discovered that he could not achieve human happiness even with his supernatural powers, he discarded them and died fighting a bear. Another variant of the story is that the rock formation is a [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|petrified]] wedding party. A notable [[opera]] of the [[Hans Heiling|same name]] was inspired by the tale.

The poem "Ballad", by [[Gerda Mayer]], is based on the wedding party variant and appears in The Oxford Book of Story Poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Book of Story Poems|year=1990|publisher=OUP|isbn=0 19 276087 4|pages=27–29|editor=Michael Harrison and Christopher Stuart-Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Irvine''' family were agricultural pioneers and prominent [[landowner]]s in California who gave their name to the city of [[Irvine, California]].

==James Irvine I==
'''James Irvine''' (1827–1886) was born in [[County Down]], [[Ireland]] on December 27, 1827, the second to the youngest of nine children. When [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Ireland's potato crop failed]] in 1845, James Irvine and his younger brother William were among those who left for the [[United States]]. The family name is Scottish, meaning that James would have been an [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scot]], or [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]]. Irvine worked for two years in [[New York City]]. In 1848 Irvine went to join the [[California Gold Rush]] as a merchant and miner. In 1854, he purchased an interest in a [[San Francisco]] commission house on Front Street, operated by a relative, John Lyons. The business was renamed "Irvine &amp; Co., wholesale produce and grocery merchants". He began investing his profits in income-producing San Francisco real estate and soon became a wealthy man. Irvine also became a silent partner in the sheep-raising venture [[Flint, Bixby &amp; Company]] of brothers Thomas and Benjamin Flint, and their cousin [[Bixby land companies|Llewellyn Bixby]]. The purchase of the {{convert|48800|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Rancho San Joaquin]] in 1864 and the {{convert|47200|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Rancho Lomas de Santiago]] in 1866 marked the beginning of their operations in Southern California. In 1867, Irvine married Henrietta Maria (Nettie) Rice, the daughter of prominent [[Cleveland, Ohio]], educator, writer, poet and State Senator [[Harvey Rice]], who was a direct descendant of [[Edmund Rice (1638)|Edmund Rice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt5779q2gb&amp;chunk.id=bioghist-1.8.3&amp;brand=oac Guide to the Rice Family Papers]&lt;/ref&gt; Nettie died in 1874, and Irvine married Margaret Byrne in 1880. He died March 15, 1886, and is buried in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;''Notables Of The West V2: Being The Portraits And Biographies Of The Progressive Men Of The West'', 1915, by International News Service&lt;/ref&gt;

==James Irvine II==
'''James Harvey Irvine, Sr.''' (1867–1947), son of James Irvine I and [[Harvey Rice|Henrietta Maria (Nettie) Rice]], was born October 16, 1867, in San Francisco.&lt;ref name=Blue&gt;[[Thomas William Herringshaw|Herringshaw, Thomas William]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=kykEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA293 ''American Elite and Sociologist Bluebook'', p. 293.] American Blue Book Publishers, 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother died when he was seven years old, and his father died when he was about eighteen. Between the time of James Irvine I's death in 1886 and James Irvine II's inheritance of the Southern California real estate holdings upon his twenty-fifth birthday in 1892, the properties were supervised by James Irvine I's brother, George Irvine. James II bought out Flint and the other partners, and formed the [[Irvine Company]]. He married Frances Anita Plum in 1892, and they had three children, "Jase", James Harvey Irvine Jr. (1894–1935), Katharine Helena Irvine (1894–1920) and Myford Plum Irvine (1898–1959). In 1931, James II married Mrs. Kathryn Brown White, who died in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Cleland, Robert Glass. The Irvine Ranch of Orange County: 1810-1950. San Marino, Calif.: The Huntington Library, 1952, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; James II lived in San Francisco until the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], when he relocated to the Irvine Ranch. He was a member of the [[Bohemian Club]], and kept a residence in San Francisco, at 2421 Pierce Street.&lt;ref name=Blue/&gt; He established the [[James Irvine Foundation]] in 1937, an entity dedicated to the "general well-being of the citizens and residents of the state of California." James II owned nearly a third of the land in present-day [[Orange County, California|Orange County]]. The city of [[Irvine, California|Irvine]] (formerly Myford) is named after him. He died of [[Bright's disease]] in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~npmelton/sfbirvi.htm James Irvine II]&lt;/ref&gt;

==James Irvine III==
'''James Harvey Irvine, Jr.''' (1894–1935) was groomed since a young man to take over the Ranch. He married Madeline Agassiz in 1914, but they were divorced in 1928. He married Athalie Richardson (1903–1993) in 1929, and they had one daughter, Athalie Anita "Joan" Irvine (1933– ). When James Irvine III died of tuberculosis in 1935, James II set up the James Irvine Foundation, a charitable organization to hold controlling stock in the Irvine Company. When James II died in 1947, Myford Plum Irvine (1898–1959),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSmid=1380347&amp;GRid=8286758&amp; Myford Plum Irvine @ find a grave]&lt;/ref&gt; James II's only surviving child, took over the presidency of the Irvine Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brower |first=Martin A |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Irvine Ranch : a time for people : a 50-year overview of the development of the Irvine Ranch |year=1994 |publisher= |quote= | url= |isbn=978-0-9641326-0-3 }}

'''Kupanta-Kurunta''' was the first recorded [[king]] of [[Arzawa]], in the late 15th century BC. He was defeated by [[Tudhaliya I]] and [[Arnuwanda I]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Routledge Handbook of The People and Places of Ancient Western Asia'' by Trevor Bryce&lt;/ref&gt; He then attacked Arnuwanda's restive vassal [[Madduwatta]] at [[Zippasla]]. He had a daughter, who married Madduwatta.

Another '''Kupanta-Kurunta''' was born in the 1330s or 1320s BC at [[Mira (Anatolia)|Mira]] in western [[Anatolia]], in one of the princely families. His father joined a coup against king [[Mašḫuiluwa]]. The [[Hittites|Hittite]] king [[Suppiluliuma I]] married Mašḫuiluwa to his daughter Muwatti and reinstalled him. Kupanta-Kurunta's father apparently died or was exiled soon after. Mašḫuiluwa then asked Suppiluliuma's successor [[Mursili II]] if he could adopt Kupanta-Kurunta as a son.

Mira remained a Hittite ally against [[Uhha-Ziti]] of Arzawa; but two years after [[Mursili's eclipse]] (which would mean 1310 BC) Mira rebelled under influence from "Great-House-Father" (probably an adventurer from Masa). Mursili quashed this rebellion, transferred Mašḫuiluwa to a priesthood in [[Hittites|Hittite]] territory, and installed Kupanta-Kurunta as king.

In the early 13th century BC, [[Muwatalli II]] signed a treaty with Alaksandu of [[Wilusa]]. In it, he informed Alaksandu that he viewed Kupanta-Kurunta as the son of Muwatti and so a member of the Hittite royal family.

Kupanta-Kurunta is possibly the recipient of the [[Milawata letter]].

Kupanta-Kurunta apparently supported [[Hattusili III]] over Hattusili's nephew Urhi-Tessup, "[[Mursili III]]". After Hattusili attained the kingdom, Kupanta-Kurunta received a letter from Pharaoh [[Rameses II]] which was copied to Hattusili. In it, the Pharaoh reassured Kupanta-Kurunta that [[Egypt]] remained a full ally of [[Hittite Empire|Hatti]] and entertained no plans to aid Urhi-Tessup in any further adventures.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters of the Great Kings of the Ancient Near East'' by [[Trevor Bryce]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6089">'''LOVEINT''' is the practice of [[intelligence service]] employees making use of their extensive monitoring capabilities to spy on their [[love interest]] or [[spouse]]. The term was coined in resemblance to intelligence terminology such as [[Signals Intelligence|SIGINT]], [[COMINT]] or [[HUMINT]].

== National Security Agency ==
The term LOVEINT originated at the [[National Security Agency|NSA]], where approximately one such incident has been reported per year.

On 21 November 2013 [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] from the [[National Crime Agency#Organisational Structure|Human Trafficking Unit]] arrested two suspects at a residential address in [[Lambeth]], [[South London]]. A 73-year-old ethnic Indian [[Singaporean]] man, Aravindan Balakrishnan, and a 67-year-old [[Tanzanian]]&lt;ref name = "growing up"/&gt; woman, his wife, Chanda Pattni, had been investigated for [[slavery]] and [[domestic servitude]].&lt;ref name="Halliday"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Standard"/&gt; The case centred around the [[Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought]] commune which was led by Balakrishnan. In the early 1980s after a police raid, Balakrishnan decided to move the group's activities underground. Balakrishnan's control over his followers intensified and the commune became a prison to his followers.  On 25 October 2013, three women were rescued from the commune. These were: a 69-year-old [[Malaysians in the United Kingdom|Malaysian]] woman (later revealed to be Aishah Wahab),&lt;ref name="Sawer"/&gt; a 57-year-old [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] woman (Josephine Herivel) and a 30-year-old [[United Kingdom|British]] woman (Katy Morgan-Davies).&lt;ref name="Standard"&gt;{{cite news |title=Women victims 'held for 30 years' |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/panewsfeeds/women-victims-held-for-30-years-8954976.html |publisher=London Evening Standard |date=21 November 2013 |accessdate=21 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Katy Morgan-Davies was born into the sect and hadn't experienced the outside world until her release.

==Perpetrator==
'''Aravindan Balakrishnan''' (known to his followers as "'''Comrade Bala'''") was born in [[Kerala]], [[India]] but migrated to  [[Singapore]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], where his father was a soldier, when he was 10.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ward|first1=Victoria|title=Aravindan Balakrishnan: the Maoist cult leader who used brutal violence and rape to strip women of their dignity|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/12031312/Aravindan-Balakrishnan-the-Maoist-cult-leader-who-used-brutal-violence-and-rape-to-strip-women-of-their-dignity.html|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balakrishnan was a student at [[Raffles Institution]] and later the [[University of Singapore]], where although gaining a reputation as a "quiet chap",&lt;ref name="Reuters-AO"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Reuters|title=UK Maoist cult leader raped followers, enslaved daughter|url=http://www.asiaone.com/world/uk-maoist-cult-leader-raped-followers-enslaved-daughter|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=AsiaOne|date=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; he became increasingly politically active and believed that he would have been imprisoned in Singapore had he openly admitted to being a [[communist]].&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; In 1977, while living in London, His Singaporean citizenship – which he gained in 1960 – was revoked due to his leadership of the [[Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought]], which the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] accused of engaging in "activities which are prejudicial to the security" of Singapore, and denounced him as a radical "closely associated with [[Eurocommunists]]".&lt;ref name="Reuters-AO" /&gt; The authorities claimed that Balakrishnan and others, many of them former Singaporean students he had associated with in London, were plotting to overthrow Singapore's leader, [[Lee Kuan Yew]].&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt;

Despite believing the United Kingdom to be a [[fascist state]] due to its treatment of the people of Singapore during the [[Malayan Emergency]], Balakrishnan emigrated to the UK in 1963 on a [[British Council]] scholarship to study at the [[London School of Economics]], and married his wife Chandra in 1971.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; Over the years he built up a following by giving lectures and staging various [[sit-in]]s and protests. He was a regular attendee at [[London]] demonstrations, where he waved banners depicting the Chinese leader [[Mao Zedong]] and addressed the crowds.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt;

In 1974, Balakrishnan and his "small clique" were expelled from the [[Communist Party of England (Marxist–Leninist)]] on account of "their pursuance of conspiratorial and [[wikt:splittist|splittist]] activities ... spreading [[social fascist]] slanders against the Party and the proletarian movement" and attempting "to put themselves above the discipline of the Party".&lt;ref name="CPE(M-L) statement"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.hightide/cpestatements.htm "Statements of the National Executive Committee, CPE (ML)"], ''The Marxist-Leninist'', 1:1, September 1974, reprinted at marxists.org. Quoted in Nick Cohen [http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/nick-cohen/2013/11/cultists-communists-too-close-to-us-for-comfort/ "Cultists &amp; communists – too close to us for comfort"], ''The Spectator'' (blog), 25 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The CPE(M–L) "repudiated the metaphysical logic harmfully promoted" by Balakrishnan in "opposition to dialectical materialism and the concrete analysis of concrete conditions".&lt;ref name="CPE(M-L) statement"/&gt; In response, Balakrishnan set up the Workers' Institute and launched his own publication, the ''South London Workers' Bulletin'', which accused the CPE(M–L) of being "fascists" and "agents of imperialism".&lt;ref name="Ford-WW-989"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ford|first1=Eddie|title=Maoist 'slaves': Combating the fascist state in Brixton  - Weekly Worker|url=http://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/989/maoist-slaves-combating-the-fascist-state-in-brixt/|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=Weekly Worker|issue=989|date=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1974 and 1976, his followers attempted to "build revolutionary stable base areas in working-class communities",&lt;ref name="On Building a"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Workers’ Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought|title=On Building a Revolutionary Stable Base Area|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.hightide/stable-base.htm|work=Encyclopedia of Anti-Revisionism On-Line|year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily [[South London]], and worked in ordinary jobs. Balakrishnan discouraged his followers from joining [[trade unions]], describing them as agents of the "imperialist fascist bourgeoisie".&lt;ref name="Smith-Conv"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Evan|title=Inside the paranoid Maoist cults of 1970s Britain|url=http://theconversation.com/inside-the-paranoid-maoist-cults-of-1970s-britain-20739|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=The Conversation|date=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, after the more liberal members of his group drifted away, a cult of around 10 female members formed around him. The collective moved to Brixton in 1976, under the title [[Workers Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought]].&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; Following [[Mao Zedong#Death and aftermath|Mao's death in 1976]], the Institute built the Mao Zedong Memorial Centre at 140 Acre Lane, [[Brixton]], which also functioned as a communist collective of "thirteen comrades", with "13 members living on the premises, half in paid work, six doing full-time revolutionary work, with a strong emphasis on women taking a leading role (apart from leading the Party Committee headed by Bala)".&lt;ref name="On Building a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith-Conv" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=High Tide: The Consolidation of Maoism by the Late 1970’s|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.hightide/|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=Encyclopedia of Anti-Revisionism On-Line}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members were handed a rota of chores and only allowed to go out in pairs, which Balakrishnan claimed was because the area they lived in was "notorious for violence" and "anything could happen".&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ward|first1=Victoria|title=Maoist 'cult' leader denies rape as he claims female commune members competed for his affections|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/12019410/Maoist-cult-leader-denies-rape-as-he-claims-female-commune-members-competed-for-his-affections.html|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=Telegraph|date=26 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a police raid on the Memorial Centre in March 1978, which the group claimed  involved "over 200 police", including officers from the [[Special Patrol Group]], "under the pretext of searching for drugs", the Workers' Institute effectively went underground, with the remaining members being convinced to end all contact with others and maintain an intense level of secrecy.&lt;ref name="Smith-Conv" /&gt; Family members were later branded fascist agents and ostracised,&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; and Balakrishnan and his captives moved to a number of properties during this time as a means for him to escape detection from the authorities.&lt;ref name="Smith-Conv" /&gt; Balakrishnan convinced his followers that everything was controlled by him from the sun, the moon, wind and fires; that he could overthrow governments, control natural disasters, and make people live or die.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; In order to progress his cause, Balakrishnan invented "JACKIE" (an acronym for [[Jehovah]], [[Allah]], [[Christ]], [[Krishna]] and [[Eknath Easwaran|Immortal Easwaran]]) – a type of dangerous, mystical machine that monitored all thought and could control minds.&lt;ref name="Cooke"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cooke|first1=Rachel|title=My 30 years as prisoner of a London cult|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/22/katy-morgan-davies-interview-balakrishnan-cult-brixton-survivor|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=The Guardian|date=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Balakrishnan began sexually abusing two of the women in 1979, often physically beating them and making others watch as he did so. All of the women were beaten and four (not including his wife) were said to have been sexually assaulted or engaged with sexual relations with him.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; Balakrishnan forced the women to swallow his ejaculate as it was "the elixir of life", and claimed the women he sexually abused had been trying to seduce him out of "jealousy" for his lover.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele2" /&gt;

==Victims==
*[[Katy Morgan-Davies]] - born in 1983, she was originally named Prem Maopinduzi Davies. She began calling herself "Rosie" in her teens. She has subsequently changed her name to Katy Morgan-Davies, after the American singer [[Katy Perry]]. She is the biological daughter of Balakrishnan and Sian Davies.&lt;ref name = "growing up"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-b0af7ef5-1031-4e1f-a3ac-b3c21ef0f932|title=Growing up a prisoner in a cult|date=26 January 2017|accessdate=28 January 2017|author=Vanessa Engle|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan-Davies was brought up entirely isolated from the outside world and never went to a nursery, school, dentist or doctor. She was not told who her parents were. The commune members taught her to read and write.&lt;ref name=bbc2&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-b0af7ef5-1031-4e1f-a3ac-b3c21ef0f932&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Sian Davies]] - in the early 1980s, after joining the commune, she had a sexual relationship with Balakrishnan.  On Christmas Eve 1996, Morgan-Davies remembered seeing Davies bound and gagged on the living room for trying to escape. Later, she fell out of a top floor bathroom window and was taken to hospital. In hospital she suffered a rapid decline in her mental health and fell into a coma. She died eight months later.  After the fall, her family were told she had gone to India to do charity work.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} At the time of Davie's death her daughter, Morgan-Davies, did not know she was her mother.

*[[Aishah Wahab]] - a [[Malaysians|Malaysian]] woman who moved to the United Kingdom at the age of 24 to study, joining the group shortly after.&lt;ref name = "growing up"/&gt; Aishah was reportedly so drawn in by Balakrishnan's Marxist rhetoric that she left her fiancé and moved in with the collective.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

*[[Oh Kar Eng]] - nurse from [[Malaysia]] who had followed Balakrishnan from the 1970s. She hit her head on a cupboard in 2001 and suffered a stroke. No medical treatment was allowed by the commune and she died the next day.{{r|bbc}} The police were not informed of the accident. Her family were not told about her cremation, and they were told the commune did not have their ashes when in fact they were in a lockup garage in West Norwood.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

*[[Josephine Herivel]] - known as Josie, was a violinist studying at the [[Royal College of Music]] before she joined the group.&lt;ref name = "growing up"/&gt; Her father, [[John Herivel]] was one of the [[Bletchley Park]] [[codebreakers]] who helped Britain and its allies win [[World War II]]. She is believed to have moved to London in the 1970s and disowned her family after becoming involved with the Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Herivel initiated the escape plan after becoming concerned with Morgan-Davies rapid weight loss (which was due to undiagnosed diabetes). Medical treatment was not permitted by the commune. Herivel secretly phoned a helpline after memorizing the number from a television program. Herivel has denounced the Balakrishnan sentencing, claiming he has been framed by the state.{{r|bbc}}

==Imprisonment and rescue==
The two older victims are believed to have met Balakrishnan in [[London]] through, according to police, a shared political ideology,&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Martin Evans [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/10472632/Slavery-case-suspects-named-as-former-Maoist-collective-leaders.html "Slavery case: suspects named as former Maoist collective leaders"], telegraph.co.uk, 25 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; as he was the leader of the [[Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/news/slave-house-couple-lambeth-leaders-1970s-political-cult 'Slave' house couple 'leaders of 1970s political cult'"], ''[[Channel 4 News]]'', 25 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  The women were not being physically restrained, but held by "invisible handcuffs" after being subjected to [[Mind control|brainwashing]], [[Psychological abuse|emotional abuse]] and [[physical abuse]] by their captors.&lt;ref name="Standard_2"&gt;{{cite news |title=London slave women endured 30 years of beatings, brainwashing and emotional control |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/london-slave-women-endured-30-years-of-beatings-brainwashing-and-emotional-control-8956001.html |publisher=London Evening Standard |date=22 November 2013 |accessdate=23 November 2013 |first=Justin |last=Davenport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 December 2014, it emerged that Balakrishnan had been charged with offences relating to cruelty to a person under 16, four counts of rape and 17 counts of indecent assault. Balakrishnan appeared before Westminster magistrates on 17 December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-30431988 "Man charged in London 'slavery' inquiry"], BBC News, 11 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, Chanda Pattni, was released earlier in 2014, as there was considered to be insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Halliday [https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/11/london-slavery-case-cps-charges-ravindan-alakrishnan "London ‘slavery’ case: CPS charges Aravindan Balakrishnan"], ''The Guardian'', 11 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15524">The entries in this tabulation cover some 150 years in the 17th and 18th centuries, when the private residents of [[Covent Garden]] included many people of rank and note. They ranged from [[Peerages in the United Kingdom|marquesses to barons]], foreign ambassadors and members of parliament to physicians, surgeons, antiquaries, artists, authors and dramatists. Some of the later arrivals were auctioneers, such as Christopher Cock and [[Abraham Langford]], who found rich sources for future sales amongst their neighbours. 

Most of the entries are derived from ''The Piazza: Notable private residents in the Piazza'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Piazza: Notable private residents in the Piazza | website = British History Online | publisher = Institute of Historical Research, University of London | date = | url = https://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol36/pp96-97 | access-date = 10 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn is based on Sheppard's ''Survey of London: Volume 36, Covent Garden''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Survey of London: Volume 36, Covent Garden | website = British History Online | publisher = Institute of Historical Research, University of London | date = | url = https://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol36 | access-date = 18 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources are noted where appropriate.

[[File:Navneforandring.jpg|thumb|right|Name change certificate issued by Christian X of Denmark in 1917]]
'''Name change''' generally refers to the legal act by a person of adopting a new name different from their name at birth, marriage or adoption.

The procedures and ease of a name change vary between jurisdictions. In general, [[common law]] jurisdictions have loose procedures for a name change while [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions are more restrictive.

A [[pseudonym]] is a name that differs from the original or true name and does not require legal sanction. It is generally adopted to conceal a person's identity, but can also be done for personal, social or ideological reasons.

==Reasons for changing one's name==
* Marriage or civil partnership. 
* To avoid a [[stalker]] or [[harassment|harassing]] person.
* To choose a surname associated with a hobby, interest, or accomplishment (e.g., old name Henry Schifberg, new name [[Henry Lizardlover]])
* To receive an inheritance conditional on adopting the name of the deceased (this reason was once quite common in landowning families in the UK)
* To replace a frivolous name given by their parents (e.g., old name Mikey Maus, new name Marcus Maus)
* To replace a name which might be considered undesirable with a more desirable one (e.g. old surname Lipschitz, new surname London)
* To dissociate oneself from a former religion (e.g., Ahmed Abdullah to Adel Karim) 
* To dissociate themselves from a famous or infamous person (e.g., old name [[Michael Jackson]] new name Martin Jackson)
* To identify with a famous or infamous person (e.g., old name Simon Johnson, new name Simon [[King Arthur|Pendragon]])
* To dissociate themselves from a family [[Black sheep (term)|black sheep]] (e.g., relatives of [[Adolf Hitler]]).
* To dissociate themselves from an ethnic origin (e.g. changing [[Battenberg family|Battenberg]] to [[Mountbatten]] or Jan Ludvik Hoch to [[Robert Maxwell]]).
* To revert to a former name (e.g., [[Cynthia Lennon]], first wife of [[John Lennon]], after her divorce from later husband John Twist).
* Commercial sponsorship (e.g., [[Jimmy White]] temporarily became Jimmy Brown for [[HP Sauce|HP brown sauce]],&lt;ref name="BBCBrown1"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/funny_old_game/4245973.stm "Jimmy Gets Saucy with Name Change"], no by-line, ''BBC News'' (online edition), "Sport: Fun and Games" section, 8 February 2005; accessed 14 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ashley Revell]] became Ashley blue square Revell for [[The Rank Group]]'s Blue Square service)
* Protest or activism (e.g., old name Jennifer Taylor, new name Jennifer [[Environmentalism|Save the Forests]])
* To change to a fictional character's name, (e.g. old name Tracy Darling, new name [[Tracy Beaker]])
* To make their name more attractive or "catchy" so as to increase their chance of success (see [[Stage name]])
* To change legal name to one used in everyday life, (e.g. where middle name has been used throughout life)
* To better fit one's [[gender identity]] as a [[transgender]] person (e.g., old name Bruce Jenner, new name [[Caitlyn Jenner]])

==United States==
In the United States, [[State law (United States)|state law]]s regulate name changes. Several federal court rulings have set precedents regarding both court decreed name changes and common law name changes (changing the name at will), including ''[[Lindon v. First National Bank]]''.

Usually a person can adopt any name desired for any reason. As of 2009, 46 states allow a person legally to change names by usage alone, with no paperwork, but a court order may be required for many institutions (such as banks or government institutions) to officially accept the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Julia Shear|last=Kushner|url=https://uclalawreview.org/pdf/57-1-7.pdf|title=The Right to Control One's Name|work=[[UCLA Law Review]]|issue=313|year=2009|pages=324–9}} The states which require a statutory name-change procedure are Hawaii, Louisiana, Maine, and Oklahoma.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the states (except Louisiana) follow common law, there are differences in acceptable requirements; usually a [[court order]] is the most efficient way to change names (which would be applied for in a [[State court (United States)|state court]]), except at marriage, which has become a universally accepted reason for a name change. It is necessary to [[pleading|plead]] that the name change is not for a [[fraud]]ulent or other illegal purpose, such as evading a [[lien]] or [[debt]] or for [[defamation|defaming]] someone else.

Applicants may be required to give a reasonable explanation for wanting to change their names. A fee is generally payable, and the applicant may be required to post legal notices in newspapers to announce the name change. Generally the judge has limited [[judicial discretion]] to grant or deny a change of name, usually only if the name change is for fraudulent, frivolous or [[Morality|immoral]] purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Edward J. Bander, ''Change of Name and Law of Names'' (Dobbs Ferry, New York: Oceana Publications, 1973) Ch. 2&amp;ndash;3.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2004, a [[Missouri]] man succeeded in changing his name to They.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/offbeat/2004-09-23-name-change_x.htm|work=USA Today|title=Missouri man legally changes his name to 'They'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Minnesota Supreme Court]] ruled that a name change to 1069 could be denied, but that Ten Sixty-Nine was acceptable (''Application of Dengler'', 1979); the [[North Dakota Supreme Court]] had denied the same request several years before (''Petition of Dengler'', 1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.court.state.nd.us/court/opinions/9205.htm|title=Petition of Dengler, 246 N.W.2d 758 (N.D. 1976)|work=state.nd.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In nearly all states, a person cannot choose a name that is intended to mislead (such as adopting a celebrity's name), that is intentionally confusing, or that incites violence; nor can one adopt, as a name, a [[racial slur]], a threat, or an [[obscene|obscenity]].

Some examples of typically allowed reasons for name changes in the U.S. include:
* Adopting a new surname upon marriage (typically the surname of the spouse, a [[hyphenated name|hyphenated surname]], or some combination of parts of both surnames).
* Returning to the use of a prior surname (e.g., a [[maiden name]]) upon divorce.
* Simplification or improved familiarity of spelling or pronunciation.

Under the federal immigration-and-nationality law, when aliens apply for [[naturalization]], they have the option of asking for their names to be changed upon the grants of citizenship with no additional fees. This allows them the opportunity to adopt more [[Cultural assimilation#Immigrant name changing as a form of assimilation|Americanized]] names.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.uscis.gov/files/form/n-400.pdf N-400 Application for Naturalization]", (US Citizenship and Immigration Services, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; During the naturalization interview, a petition for a name change is prepared to be forwarded to a [[United States federal courts|federal court]]. Applicants certify that they are not seeking a change of name for any unlawful purpose such as the avoidance of debt or evasion of [[Police|law enforcement]]. Such a name change would become final if within their jurisdiction, once a [[United States federal courts|federal court]] naturalizes an applicant.

To maintain a person's [[identity (social science)|identity]], it is desirable to obtain a formal order so there is continuity of personal records.

===Informal methods of legal name change===

====Assumed name====
The "open and notorious" use of a name is often sufficient to allow one to use an [[assumed name]]. In some jurisdictions, a trade name distinct from one's legal name can be registered with a county clerk, [[Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|secretary of state]], or other similar government authority. Persons who wish to publish materials and not to be associated with them may publish under [[pseudonym]]s; such a right is protected under [[case law]] pursuant to [[United States Constitution]].

====Usage method====
A common law name (i.e. one assumed for a non-fraudulent purpose) is a legal name.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', ''State v. Ford'', 172 P. 802; ''Bonnie Lee Daniels'', 337 A.2d 49; ''Elizabeth Marie Hauptly'' 312 N.E.2d 857; ''Piotrowski v. Piotrowski'', 247 N.W.2d 354; ''Thomas v. Thomas'', 427 N.E.2d 1009; ''Klein v. Klein'', 373 A.2d 86; ''Stuart v. Board of Elections'', 295 A.2d 223.&lt;/ref&gt; In most states a statutory method, while quick and definitive, only supplements the common law method,&lt;ref&gt;''In Matter of Linda A.'', 480 N.Y.S.2d 996.&lt;/ref&gt; unless the statute makes itself exclusive. Although a person may sue under a common law name.&lt;ref&gt;''Hoffman v. Bank of America'', (M.D. Florida 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[California]] the "usage method" (changing the name at will under common law) is sufficient to change the name.  Not all jurisdictions require that the new name be used exclusively.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Kreuter v US'', 201 F2d 33 (true name need not be abandoned), Florida Statute 322.22 (driver's licenses in two names), ''Loser v. Plainfield'', 128 N.W. 1101 (Iowa), ''Ludwinska v John Hancock'', 317 Pa 577 (may be used for just one nonfraudulent transaction).&lt;/ref&gt; Any fraudulent use or intent, such as changing the name to the same name as another person's name, may invalidate this type of name change.

Specifically in California, Code of Civil Procedure § 1279.5 and Family Code § 2082 regulate common law and court decreed name changes. Code of Civil Procedure § 1279.5 (a) reads, "Except as provided in subdivision (b), (c), (d), or (e), nothing in this title shall be construed to abrogate the common law right of any person to change his or her name." Subdivisions b through e preclude one from changing their name by common law if they are in state prison, on probation, on parole, or have been convicted of a serious sex offense. If a person is not in any of these categories, then a common law name change is allowed. (Family Code § 2082 also contains some of the same wording.)

====Preferred name====
Many universities, hospitals, and other institutions allow one to use a "preferred name" instead of one's legal name.  This name can show up on class rosters, online learning platforms, and student [[ID card]]s.  It provides a "transitional"
name change for those who have yet to, or cannot, receive a court-ordered name change.&lt;ref name="UC Davis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Preferred Name {{!}} Office of the University Registrar|url=https://registrar.ucdavis.edu/records/preferred-name.cfm|website=registrar.ucdavis.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leicester"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a preferred first name or preferred last name? — University of Leicester|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/hr/policies/ess/Questions/what-is-a-preferred-first-name-or-preferred-last-name|website=www2.le.ac.uk|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Official registration===
A legal name change is merely the first step in the name-change process. A person must officially register the new name with the appropriate authorities whether the change was made as a result of a court order, marriage, divorce, adoption, or any of the other methods described above. The process includes notifying various government agencies, each of which may require legal proof of the name change and that may or may not charge a fee. Important government agencies to be notified include the [[Social Security Administration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://faq.ssa.gov/link/portal/34011/34019/Article/3749/|title=How do I change or correct my name on my Social Security number card?|work=ssa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bureau of Consular Affairs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/passport/npic/agencies/agencies_913.html|title=U.S. Passports &amp; International Travel|work=state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for passports), the [[Federal Communications Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Forms/Form605/605.html|title=FCC Form 605|author=FCC Internet Services Staff|work=fcc.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422032207/http://transition.fcc.gov/Forms/Form605/605.html|archivedate=2014-04-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Selective Service System]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sss.gov/regisrantsbk.htm#RegistrantObligations|title=Selective Service System: Registrant Obligations|website=www.sss.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329020540/http://www.sss.gov/regisrantsbk.htm#RegistrantObligations|archivedate=2015-03-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Department of Motor Vehicles (for a new driver's license, learner permit, state identification card, or vehicular registration). Additionally the new name must be registered with other institutions such as employers, banks, doctors, mortgage, insurance and credit card companies. Online services are available to assist in this process either through direct legal assistance or automated form processing.

Although state requirements differ, it is generally recommended to first register a new name with the Social Security office as some state motor-vehicle departments require updated social security cards to make changes; [[Arizona]] is one of these states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azdot.gov/mvd/faqs/scripts/faqs.asp?section=dl#1|title=Motor Vehicle Services|work=azdot.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most states require name changes to be registered with their departments of motor vehicles (DMVs) within a certain amount of time. For example, [[South Carolina]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scdmvonline.com/DMVNew/default.aspx?n=general_driver_license_information#NameorAddressChanges {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228092155/http://www.scdmvonline.com/DMVNew/default.aspx?n=general_driver_license_information |date=2012-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wyoming]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dot.state.wy.us/Default.jsp?sCode=drvna] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919202553/http://dot.state.wy.us/Default.jsp?sCode=drvna|date=September 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; require a name change be registered with their office within ten days.

The forms, along with the state-specific requirements, can generally be obtained for free.

Many states will require reasons for wanting a name change. For example, in Florida, a court will not grant a petition for a change of name if it finds that (i) the petitioner has ulterior or illegal motives in seeking the name change, (ii) the petitioner's civil rights are suspended, or (iii) granting the name change will invade the property rights (''e.g.'', intellectual property rights) of others.&lt;ref&gt;see, e.g., [http://abcfamilylaw.com/practice-areas/change-of-name www.abcfamilylaw.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128015829/http://www.abcfamilylaw.com/practice-areas/change-of-name |date=2010-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], citizens and residents have the freedom to change their names with relative ease.

In theory, anyone who is at least 16 and resident in the United Kingdom can call themselves whatever they wish. However, over the past hundred years or so, formal procedures that are recognized by record holders such as government departments, companies and organizations have evolved, which enable a citizen legally to change the name recorded on their [[passport]], [[driving licence]], tax and [[National Insurance]] records, bank and credit cards, etc., provided that "documentary evidence" of a change of name is provided. Documents such as [[birth certificate|birth]], [[marriage certificate|marriage]] and educational certificates cannot be changed because these documents are "matters of fact", which means that they were correct at the time they were issued.

Documentary evidence of a change of name can be in a number of forms, such as a marriage certificate, [[decree absolute]], civil partnership certificate, [[statutory declaration]] or [[deed of change of name]]. Such documents are mere evidence that a change of name has occurred, however, and they do not themselves operate to change a person's name. Deeds of change of name are by far the most commonly used method of providing evidence of a change of name other than changing a woman's surname after marriage. A deed poll is a legal document that binds a single person to a particular course of action (in this case, changing one's name for all purposes). The term 'deed' is common to signed, written agreements that have been shown to all concerned parties. Strictly speaking, it is not a contract because it binds only one party and expresses an intention instead of a promise. 'Poll' is an old legal term referring to official documents that had cut edges (were polled) so that they were straight.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/files/deedpolls_notes_0308.doc ''Enrolling a Name Change in the Royal Courts of Justice''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002143613/http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/files/deedpolls_notes_0308.doc |date=2008-10-02 }} (March 2008).

===England and Wales===
People whose births are registered in England and Wales may have their deed poll enrolled at the [[Royal Courts of Justice]] in London.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; See also [[College of Arms#Change of names]].

====Historical usage====
{{See also|Double-barrelled name#British tradition}}
From the mediaeval age to the 19th century, the era of family dynasties, name changes were frequently demanded of heirs in the last wills and testaments, legacies and bequests, of members of the gentry and nobility who were the last males of their bloodline. Such persons frequently selected a younger nephew or cousin as the heir to their estates on condition that he should adopt the surname and armorials of the legator in lieu of his patronymic. Thus the ancient family otherwise destined to extinction would appear to continue as a great dynasty in the making. Such changes were also more rarely demanded by [[marriage settlement]]s, for example where the father of a sole daughter and heiress demanded that as a condition of his daughter's [[dowry]] her husband should adopt his father-in-law's surname and arms. Thus the progeny of the marriage would continue the otherwise extinct family's name. Such name changes were generally only demanded of younger sons, where an elder brother was available to inherit the paternal estates under primogeniture and carry on the name and arms abandoned by the younger brother. Such name changes were effected by obtaining a private [[Act of Parliament]] or by obtaining a Royal Licence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deedpolloffice.com/research#royal-licences|title=Researching a past change of name – D•P•O|work=Deed Poll Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; A less radical procedure adopted from the 18th century onwards was for the legator or settlor to demand only that the legatee or beneficiary should adopt his surname ''in addition to'' his patronymic, not in place of it, which gave rise to the "[[Double-barrelled name|double-barrelled]]", even the "triple-barrelled" name, frequently parodied in literature as epitomising the wealthy "[[squirearchy]]" with an embarrassment of inherited estates.

Well known examples are:
*Russell to Gorges (14th century). Ralph IV Gorges, 2nd Baron Gorges, died without issue in 1331. In an effort to preserve his family name and arms he made one of his younger nephews his heir, on condition that he should adopt the name and arms of Gorges. This nephew was William Russell, the second son of his second sister Eleanor de Gorges who had married Sir Theobald Russell (d.1341) of [[Kingston Russell]], Dorset. The event is referred to in one of the earliest heraldic law cases brought concerning English armory, [[Warbelton v. Gorges]] in 1347.
*Smithson to Percy (18th century). [[Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland|Sir Hugh Smithson, 4th Baronet]] (1715–1786) (c.1714–1786) in 1740 married [[Elizabeth Percy, Duchess of Northumberland|Lady Elizabeth Seymour]], daughter and sole heiress of [[Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset]], and granddaughter of Lady Elizabeth Percy (d.1722), daughter and sole heiress of [[Josceline Percy, 11th Earl of Northumberland]] (1644–1670). In 1740, by a private Act of Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deedpolloffice.com/research/private-acts-parliament/1749-23-Geo-2-14|title=Hugh Earl of Northumberland's name and arms. – D•P•O|work=Deed Poll Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smithson changed his surname to Percy and inherited the title [[Earl of Northumberland]] and was later created [[Duke of Northumberland]].

===Scotland===
People whose births are [[civil registration|registered]] in Scotland (or who were adopted in Scotland) can change their name in the same way as people from the rest of the United Kingdom.  However they can optionally apply to the [[Registrar General for Scotland]] to have their birth certificate amended to show the new name and have the respective register updated.

==Other common law countries==

=== Australia ===
Individuals may legally change their name through the [[States and territories of Australia|state and territory]] governments of Australia according to state or territory laws and regulations via agencies generally titled "Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australia.gov.au/information-and-services/family-and-community/births-deaths-and-marriages-registries|title=Births, deaths and marriages registries – australia.gov.au|first=Digital Transformation|last=Agency|website=www.australia.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Exceptions exist for some states such as restricted persons (e.g. jail inmate)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bdm.nsw.gov.au/Pages/change-of-name/change-of-name.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and in some states, changes may only be made once a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qld.gov.au/law/births-deaths-marriages-and-divorces/changing-your-name/changing-your-name/|title=Changing your name – Your rights, crime and the law|first=; c=AU; o=The State of Queensland; ou=Communication Services|last=Branch|website=www.qld.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutions such as banks,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.austrac.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/cip_form_ind_mar08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the Passports Office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.passports.gov.au/passportsexplained/theapplicationprocess/eligibilityoverview/Pages/confirmingidentity.aspx|title=Documents that confirm your Australian citizenship and identity|first=Australian Passports|last=Office|website=www.passports.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; and transport authorities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transport.wa.gov.au/licensing/change-my-name.asp|title=Change my name|first=|last=nw|website=www.transport.wa.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; require proof of identity, so people who change their names need to have proof of the change.

If a person's birth or adoption was registered in Australia, the change will also be noted (in most cases) on the person's birth or adoption registration, and in some states or territories, the name change can be evidenced either through a re-issued [[Birth certificate#Australia|birth certificate]] if born in Australia and/or "Change of Name Certificate".  These certificates are recognised secure [[Identity documents of Australia|identity documents]] and can be verified electronically through the [[Attorney-general of Australia]]'s Document Verification Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/IdentitySecurity/Pages/DocumentVerificationService.aspx|title=Document Verification Service|first=Attorney-General's|last=Department|website=www.ag.gov.au|access-date=2017-04-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321081501/https://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/IdentitySecurity/Pages/DocumentVerificationService.aspx|archive-date=2017-03-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada a person can informally call themselves whatever they want. In all provinces except [[Quebec]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/publications/generale/maria-a.htm#names {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123172016/http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/publications/generale/maria-a.htm |date=2010-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when someone gets married they can change their last name without legally changing their name by using their [[Marriage Certificate]] as verification of the name change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.programs.alberta.ca/Living/5962.aspx?Ns=364+6228&amp;N=770|title=Government of Alberta – Programs and Services – Getting Married|author=Government of Alberta|work=alberta.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is almost impossible for married women in Québec to take their husbands' names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=72ddc06b-4660-4b92-8b92-3a26ae24b377&amp;k=5969|title=Quebec newlywed furious she can't take her husband's name|work=Canada.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102072805/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=72ddc06b-4660-4b92-8b92-3a26ae24b377&amp;k=5969|archivedate=2016-01-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Like the United States, the requirements for a formal name change varies from province to province. Except for [[Ontario]], [[British Columbia]] and [[New Brunswick]], [[Canadians]] must be 18 to change their names and have lived in the province they are changing it in for at least 3 months to a year, depending on province. (In [[British Columbia]], Canadians must be 19 to change their names, in [[Ontario]] and [[New Brunswick]] 16.) People younger than the province's [[age of majority]] can change their names if they have their guardians' consent, are legally married, or have a [[common law marriage]].&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/name-change/how-to.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220124142/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/name-change/how-to.html|date=February 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; To change a name, a Name Change application must be submitted to either the Ministry of Government Services, Court of justice or Registrar of civil status. A document such as a birth certificate must be submitted. A statement as to why the name is being changed is needed in most areas and the reason has to be serious. In Canada, a name cannot cause confusion, be used for misrepresentation or fraud and in most cases the name change is announced in newspapers. There is a fee involved and it ranges from $10 to $185 depending on the territory or province.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt; [[British Columbia]], [[Alberta]] and [[Manitoba]] need [[Fingerprint recognition|fingerprints]] to be submitted before one changes their name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cba.org/BC/public_media/family/161.aspx] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023224732/http://www.cba.org/BC/public_media/family/161.aspx|date=October 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crcvc.ca/docs/How%20do%20I%20change%20my%20name.pdf|title=How do I change my name?|format=PDF|work=Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime|accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}
It is a common practice for ethnic Chinese residents of Hong Kong to adopt a western-style English name in addition to their transliterated Chinese name. As they often adopt western-style English names after being registered on the birth register, the fact that they want to include a western-style English name as part of their [[Legal name|legal English name]] is regarded as a name change which usually requires a deed poll.

However, the [[Immigration Department (Hong Kong)|Immigration Department]] which is responsible for processing applications for name change allows applicants to submit such applications without deeds poll; anyone who has a phonetic English name only and wishes to include a western-style English name as part of his or her legal English name can apply to the Immigration Department without a deed poll. Only one application of this kind is allowed for each applicant; any application for subsequent change(s) must be made with a deed poll.

===Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], a person earns their name by "use and repute". For most purposes it is enough to simply use the desired name and ask others to call you by that name. For some administrative purposes, such as changing a name on a driving licence or [[Legal aspects of transgenderism#Republic of Ireland|legally changing gender]], a [[deed of change of name]] must be registered with the [[Four Courts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth_family_relationships/problems_in_marriages_and_other_relationships/changing_your_name_by_deed_poll.html|title=Changing your name by deed poll|website=www.citizensinformation.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth_family_relationships/changing_to_your_preferred_gender.html|title=Changing to your preferred gender|website=www.citizensinformation.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
From September 1995, [[New Zealanders]] can change their name by making a [[statutory declaration]] and, if approved, the new name is registered with the Births, Deaths and Marriages section of the Department of Internal Affairs (Identity Services). Prior to September 1995, they changed their name by [[deed poll]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/Files/EOIStandard/$file/EOIStandard.pdf Evidence of Identity Standard] NZ Department of Internal Affairs, June 2006, Version 1.0, {{ISBN|0-478-24462-2}}, page 123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil law==
In general, unlike in [[common law]] countries, names cannot be changed at will in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions. Usually, a name change requires government approval and is only rarely granted, though legal name changes have become more common in some jurisdictions over the last years. The reason given for this system is usually the public interest in the unique identifiability of a person, e.g., in governmental registers, although with the advent of [[personal identification numbers]], that rationale may be in need of reconsideration.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Belgium===
In Belgian law, a name is in principle considered fixed for life, but under exceptional circumstances, a person may apply to the Ministry of Justice for a name change. This requires a Royal Decree (French: ''Arrêté royal'', Dutch: ''Koninklijk besluit'') for last names, but only a Ministerial Decree for first names. The new name must not cause confusion or cause damage to the bearer or others. Examples of requests that are usually considered favorably:
* A person of non-European origin who wants to adopt a less exotic name to further his/her integration in Belgian society
* A person stuck with a ridiculous last name that is causing him/her great embarrassment or emotional distress. Actual examples: Salami, Naaktgeboren ("born naked"), and Clooten ("sods of earth" in Middle Dutch, but "testicles" in modern Dutch)
* (for minor children) following legal adoption or recognition of paternity&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.just.fgov.be/nl_htm/informatie/htm_justitie_atotz/naamveranderen.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514153237/http://www.just.fgov.be/nl_htm/informatie/htm_justitie_atotz/naamveranderen.html|date=May 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
According to the Brazilian Civil Code and the Public Registries Act, the name registered after birth is definitive and immutable. However, there are some circumstances under which a name change is allowed: 
* If an obvious writing error is made while registering the name of the child.  
* In the first year after a person reaches the [[age of majority]] (18&amp;nbsp;years), they can request a change in their first names, but modification of surnames is not allowed.  
* If a person's name exposes them to ridicule and harms their everyday well-being.  
* If a person is recognized publicly by another name, they can request a name change or addition, by providing as support three testimonials of the change in name.  
* If a person has undergone a sex change, recent jurisprudence has allowed name modifications in most such cases.

===India===
In India, the person concerned submits a name change request to an appropriate authority, with supporting documents. Subsequently, an application must be made to the Government Printing Press, which issues an Official Gazette Notification certifying the change of name.&lt;ref&gt;http://goaprintingpress.gov.in/uploads/Change%20of%20Name%20and%20Surname%20Act.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}
Although it has always been relatively easy to change one's legal names in Norway, it used to require some kind of government approval. As late as 1830, local vicars were instructed to write both given (Christian) names, as well as last names, in the baptismal record. Earlier, only the given name of the child, birth date, baptismal date, and sex were written down, alongside the parents' names. It was not until the beginning of the 20th century, however, that the authorities required everyone to adopt a family surname. Until about 1980, the government still required that a name change applicant apply to the government regional representative (fylkesmann). The law has been replaced twice since then. Nowadays, the process is as easy as in common-law countries; the subject merely submits the names wanted (providing that the surname chosen is not in use or is not used by fewer than 200 persons) to the local authorities for the purposes of election rosters and census counts; there is no longer an application process.

===Philippines===
2001 RA 9048 amends Articles 376 and 412 of the [[Civil Code of the Philippines]], which prohibit the change of name or surname of a person, or any correction or change of entry in a civil register without a judicial order. Administrative Order No. 1 Series of 2001, implemented the law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/irr_ra9048.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621060551/http://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/irr_ra9048.html|date=June 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It authorizes the city or municipal civil registrar or the consul general to correct a clerical or typographical error in an entry or change the first name or nickname in the civil register without need of a judicial order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/primerra9048.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212183553/http://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/primerra9048.html|archivedate=February 12, 2012|website=census.gov.ph|title= Civil Registration – Primer for RA 9048}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno9048.htm|title=PHILIPPINE LAWS, STATUTES AND CODES – CHAN ROBLES VIRTUAL LAW LIBRARY|work=chanrobles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Name and gender change====
In case of controversial and substantial changes, [[Philippines]] [[jurisprudence]] requires full-blown court [[lawsuit]], that must include the local civil registrar in the petition, since RA 9048 and Rule 108 (Cancellation or correction of entries in the Civil Registry) of the Rules of Court do not allow the change of sex in a birth certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/rulesofcourtspecialproceedings.htm#RULE%20108|title=SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS|work=chanrobles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only landmark case in the Philippines on name and legal sex change is the Jeff Cagandahan case. The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] Justice [[Leonardo Quisumbing]] on September 12, 2008, allowed Cagandahan, 27, who has [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]], to change his [[birth certificate]] name from Jennifer to Jeff, and his legal gender from female to male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080917-161148/Call-him-Jeff-says-SC-he-used-to-be-called-Jennifer|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808193038/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080917-161148/Call-him-Jeff-says-SC-he-used-to-be-called-Jennifer|archivedate=August 8, 2014|title=Call him Jeff, says SC; he used to be called Jennifer|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,24359150-401,00.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216041937/http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,24359150-401,00.html|archivedate=February 16, 2009|title=Woman's body 'naturally' became male|work=[[News.com.au]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,423242,00.html|title=Rare Condition Turns Woman Into Man|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quebec===
Although as in other jurisdictions residents of [[Quebec]] may informally use whatever name they want, procedures for formal name change are very strict as Quebec (unlike the rest of Canada) operates under a [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system. The decision must be authorized by the Director of Civil Status, and requires a valid reason for changing the name, including long-term use of the new name (in the Montreuil case cited below, the Quebec appeals court has considered five years' use to be a sufficient reason), difficulty of use due to spelling or pronunciation, or bearing a name that another person has made infamous.

Only a judge may authorize a name change for a child for reasons of abandonment, deprivation of parental authority, or change in [[Paternity (law)|filiation]] such as [[adoption]].

This has occasionally led to controversy. A lawyer named Micheline Montreuil, a non-operative [[transgender]] woman, had to undergo a lengthy process to have her name legally changed. Initially, the director of civil status refused to permit the change on the grounds that a legal male could not bear a female name. According to Quebec law, Montreuil could not change her record of sex because this requires proof of a completed [[sex reassignment surgery]], which she has not had. On November 1, 1999, the provincial court of appeal ruled that nothing in the law prevented a person who was legally male from legally adopting a woman's name. (Montreuil was initially prevented from changing her name despite this ruling on the grounds that she had not established general use, as normally required for a name change; the Quebec appeals court finally authorized the change on November 7, 2002.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.micheline.ca/page034-batailles-e.htm#dictateur|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212004926/http://www.micheline.ca/page034-batailles-e.htm|archivedate=February 12, 2012|title=Micheline Anne Hélène Montreuil and his fights|website=micheline.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Director of Civil Status will amend a Quebec birth certificate if a name change certificate is issued by another province. Some have used that loophole by temporarily moving to one of Canada's other provinces, which follow the more permissive common-law rules, in order to get the legal documents.

===South Africa===
South Africa, which uses a mixture of common law and civil [[Roman Dutch law]], mostly uses common-law procedures with regard to name change. Name changes in [[South Africa]] are regulated by the Births and Deaths Registration Act (Act 51 of 1992, as amended). The personal information of all citizens and permanent residents is recorded on the Population Register, so any name changes must be registered.

A person can change their forenames by submitting a form to the [[South African Department of Home Affairs|Department of Home Affairs]]. An individual's surname, or that of a family, may be changed by applying to the Department and providing a "good and sufficient reason" for the change.

A married woman can change her surname to that of her husband or join her maiden name with her husband's surname, and a divorced woman may return to her previous surname, without applying or paying a fee; but she must notify the department so that the details in the Population Register can be changed. (It is possible that, if challenged, these provisions might be held to be unconstitutional because they apply only to women.)

South Africa has officially recognized same sex marriages since 2006 and in doing so now allows one or both partners to change their surnames in the marriage register on the day of the marriage. A new passport and ID book can then be applied for with the new married surname as well.

The surnames of minor children can also be changed under various circumstances involving the marriage, divorce or death of a parent, children born out of wedlock, and guardianship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.home-affairs.gov.za/personal_amendments.asp ''Personal Amendments.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911222143/http://www.home-affairs.gov.za/personal_amendments.asp |date=2008-09-11 }} (c. 1997). South African Department of Home Affairs. Retrieved May 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, a name change requires the approval of the respective [[Cantons of Switzerland|Cantonal]] government, if there are important reasons (''wichtige Gründe'' / ''justes motifs'') for the change, according to article 30 of the [[Swiss Civil Code]]. When aliens apply for naturalization, they have the option of asking for their names to be changed upon the grants of citizenship with no additional fees.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} According to the case law of the [[Swiss Federal Supreme Court]], such requests must be granted only if the petitioner shows that they suffer substantially from their present name, e.g., if it is the same as that of a notorious criminal.

===Taiwan===
{{Wikibooks|Annotated Republic of China Laws/Name Act}}
In [[Taiwan]], the government strictly regulates when one's surname, given name or both may or may not be changed, under the Name Act (姓名條例) since 1953 with 10 articles, totally amended into 14 articles in 2001, and the [[s:Enforcement Regulations of the Name Act|Enforcement Regulations of the Name Act]] (姓名條例施行細則).

Legally permitted reasons to change one's given name are:&lt;ref&gt;Article 6 of the Name Act (1953) ([[s:zh:姓名條例 (民國42年)|姓名條例 (民國42年)]]), amended into Article 7 of the Name Act (2001) ([[s:zh:姓名條例 (民國90年)|姓名條例 (民國90年)]]).&lt;/ref&gt;
#Having the same name when serving in an institution or studying in the same school.
#Since 1983, having the same name as one's parent, grandparent, or great-grandparent.&lt;ref&gt;Clause 2 of Article 6 of the Name Act (1983) ([[s:zh:姓名條例 (民國72年)|姓名條例 (民國72年)]]), amended into Clause 2 of Section 1 of Article 7 of the Name Act (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;
#Having the same name as someone else who lives in the same county or city and having lived there for at least 6 months.
#Having the same name as a wanted criminal, for example [[:zh:陳進興|陳進興 (Chén Jìnxīng)]], a common name used by not only a convicted kidnapper and murderer who was executed in Taiwan for major crimes in 1997 ([[:zh:陳進興 (台灣罪犯)]]) but also a Taiwanese statesman ([[:zh:陳進興 (台灣政治人物)]]).
#Having special reasons,&lt;ref&gt;Clause 6 of Section 1 of Article 7 of the Name Act (2001) effective 15 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; which is limited to twice in one's lifetime, while the second given name change of this type may not be done before reaching adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Section 2 of Article 7 of the Name Act (2001) effective 15 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name change on religious conversion==
{{further|Religious name}}
Adherents of various religions change their name upon [[Religious conversion|conversion]] or confirmation. The name adopted may not have any legal status but will represent their adopted religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Celia Emmelhainz, [http://works.bepress.com/emmelhainz/4/ ''Naming a New Self: Identity Elasticity and Self-Definition in Voluntary Name Changes.''] (c. 2012). Names, Vol. 60, Iss. 3. Retrieved April 4, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
* Individuals who attend a ceremony to officially become Buddhists are usually given a new "[[Dharma name]]", which marks their "[[Refuge (Buddhism)|taking refuge]]".

===Christianity===
* It has been historical Christian practice to adopt a name on [[baptism]] or (in some countries) [[confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/ce001006.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050428082432/http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/ce001006.htm|date=April 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The customary practice whereby persons entering a [[religious institute]] take on a [[name in religion]] is still observed by [[Eastern Orthodox]] and some traditional [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]]. Eastern Orthodox monastics are usually given the name of a prophet or a monastic saint.
* [[Pope]]s take a [[papal name]] upon their accession to office; for example, [[Jorge M. Bergoglio]] adopted the name [[Francis (given name)|Francis]].

===Hinduism===
There is no formal concept of conversion in Hinduism but converts to Hinduism are accepted, usually after a small ceremony called [[Shuddhi|Shudhikaran]] (purification). Individuals who attend a Shudhikaran ceremony to officially become [[Hindu]] may be optionally given a new [[Dharma]] (religious) name, which is usually based on [[Sanskrit]] or [[Indian name]] such as names based on [[Hindu deities]].

===Islam===
* Converts to Islamic faith may choose a new name; although it is not required, it may in some cases be preferable for personal reasons or because the name is of uncertain Islamicity (e.g. the person converting has a [[theophoric name]] in another religion, such as Christopher or Ganesh). Boxer Cassius Clay's adoption of the name [[Muhammad Ali]] is a well-known example, as is Cat Stevens' change to [[Yusuf Islam]] and Malcolm Little's adoption of the name [[Malcolm X]] and later ''El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz''.  On the other hand, converts may choose to keep their names, as did [[Dave Chappelle]].
*Women do not normally take their husbands' surnames as their own. Their maiden name continues to be their surname even after marriage. Sometimes their husbands first name becomes their surname, similar to the case of surname chains indicating someone's chain of fathers. 
* In Islamic tradition, there are two kinds of [[surname]].
:# The first kind comes from the father's first name, which means that the particular person is the child of. For example, a name such as ''ibn Abdullah'' means "son of Abdullah", or ''bint Abdullah'' means "daughter of Abdullah". Father descendant names can be chained, meaning that an individual can have the name of their father, followed by their paternal grandfather, followed by the father of that grandfather, to indicate a patrilineal lineage.
:# The second kind is associated with [[clan]], [[tribal]] or [[ethnic]] affiliation and is also solely dependant on the person's patrilineal line. In Islamic family law, the individual is required to keep the clan, tribal or ethnic affiliation of their father where it is known, whether the child be illegitimate, staying with their mother after divorce or adopted.
The last name cannot be changed in such a way as to reflect a heritage that is not that of one's biological father.

===Judaism===
* Jewish people in the Diaspora sometimes give their children two names: a secular name for everyday use and a Hebrew name for religious purposes.  [[Conversion to Judaism|Converts to Judaism]] choose a Hebrew name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judaism.about.com/library/3_lifecycles/names/bl_names.htm|title=Choosing a Hebrew Name – Naming a Jewish Baby|author=Ariela Pelaia|work=About.com Religion &amp; Spirituality}}&lt;/ref&gt; Full Jewish names include a [[patronym]]: converts take the patronym "ben/bat Avraham Avinu" (son/daughter of Our Father Abraham) as converts are held to be spiritual descendants of [[Abraham]], the forebear of Jews.

===Sikhism===
* Those in the [[Sikh]] faith adopt a new last name upon baptism into the [[Khalsa]]. Men adopt the last name [[Singh]], while women adopt the last name [[Kaur]].
* The Sikhs adopted the name Singh in 1699 during the Birth of the Khalsa.

===Wicca===
* Some wiccans have a [[Craft name]] that is used during coven gatherings and rituals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2861">The '''Ogoni Nine''' were a group of nine activists from the [[Ogoni]] region of [[Nigeria]] who opposed the operating practices of the Royal Dutch Shell oil corporation. Their members included outspoken author and playwright [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]], Saturday Dobee, Nordu Eawo, Daniel Gbooko, Paul Levera, Felix Nuate, Baribor Bera, Barinem Kiobel, and John Kpuine (Tripathi, p.189), who were executed by [[hanging]] in 1995 by the military dictatorship of General [[Sani Abacha]] and buried in [[Port Harcourt Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="cemetery1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/450161/NIGERIAS-MILITARY-LEADERS-HANG-PLAYWRIGHT-AND-8-OTHER-ACTIVISTS.html?pg=all|title=Nigeria's Military Leaders Hang Playwright And 8 Other Activists|work=Deseretnews.com|publisher=Deseret News Publishing Company|date=1995-11-11 |accessdate=2014-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The executions provoked international condemnation and led to the increasing treatment of Nigeria as a [[pariah state]] until General Abacha's mysterious death in 1998. Saro-Wiwa had previously been a critic of the [[Royal Dutch Shell]] oil corporation, and had been imprisoned for a year prior to the executions in November 1995.

At least two witnesses who testified that Saro-Wiwa was involved in the murders of the Ogoni elders later recanted, stating that they had been bribed with money and offers of jobs with Shell to give false testimony – in the presence of Shell’s lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiwavshell.org/the-case-against-shell/ The Case Against Shell] &lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]] sued Shell for its complicity in human rights abuses against the Ogoni people, such as colluding with the Nigerian government to bring about the arrest and execution of the Ogoni Nine. In June 2009, on the eve of trial, the parties agreed to a settlement providing a total of $15.5 million to compensate the plaintiffs, establish a trust for the benefit of the Ogoni people, and cover some of the legal costs and fees associated with the case.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Phillips, [http://activistdefense.wordpress.com/2013/11/10/today-we-remember-the-ogoni-nine-executed-for-struggling-against-shell-in-nigeria/ "Today We Remember the Ogoni Nine, Executed for Struggling Against Shell in Nigeria"], Activist Defense, November 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4226">A '''patrial name''' or '''geographical surname''' is a surname or second [[cognomen]] given to person deriving from a [[toponym]], the name for a geographical place. It was particularly common in ancient Greece and Rome.&lt;ref&gt;The New Century classical handbook Catherine B. Avery - 1962 "Toponyms (place names) also appear: Coriolanus, Norbanus, Sabinus, Soranus, Tusculanus.&lt;/ref&gt;
The lack of a family [[surname]] and use of a geographical cognomen as a surname may the sign of a lower class, such as courtesans when signing a contract.&lt;ref&gt;Molière: A Theatrical Life - Page 42 Virginia Scott - 2002 "Taviani identifies Lucrezia as a courtesan because of her name that, in the fashion of courtesans, joins a Roman first name to a geographical surname and because the contract was signed in a house owned or leased by her at a time when  "&lt;/ref&gt; With medieval writers, Christian, Jewish and Muslim, whose works circulated around many countries, geographical cognomens sometimes served to distinguish better than "son of," "ben" or "ibn." 

Roman Military commanders often took a second cognomen, an [[agnomen]], recalling a victorious campaign: Africanus, Asiaticus, Macedonicus, Numantinus. These may be inherited as in the case of [[Augustus]] who inherited the cognomen Thurinus.

==Formation==
Examples in formation of patrial names include:

1. definite article and noun - using a [[demonym]] (also called [[gentile name]] or [[gentilic]], from Latin ''[[nomen gentile]]'' or ''[[gentilicium]]'')
* [[Athenagoras of Athens|Athenagoras the Athenian]] (''Athenagoras o Athenaios,'' Ἀθηναγόρας ὁ Ἀθηναῖος).
* [[Saul of Tarsus]] "Saul the Tarsian" (''Saulos o Tarseus'', Σαῦλος [ὁ] Ταρσεύς)
* [[Lucius of Cyrene|Lucius the Cyrenian]] (''Loukios o Kurenaios'' Λούκιος ὁ Κυρηναῖος)
* [[Trophimus]] "called the Ephesian" (''Trofimos o Efesios'', Τρόφιμος ὁ Ἐφέσιος)
* [[Ibn Muʿādh al-Jayyānī|Ibn Muadh al-Jayyani]] (989-1079) "al Jayyani", the man of [[Jaén, Spain|Jaén]]
* [[Isaac Alfasi]] (1013-1103) "al Fasi", the man of [[Fez, Morocco]]

2. unclear: indefinite noun / adjectival forms
* [[Mary Magdalene]], "Mary of [[Magdala]]" (Greek ''Maria Magadelene,'' Μαρία Μαγδαληνή).
 
3. adjectives - a common Latin method for making a [[toponym]]ic adjective is to add -[i]ensis
* [[Giraldus Cambrensis]] "Gerald of [[Wales]]"
* [[Galfridus Monemutensis]], "Geoffrey of [[Monmouth]]"

4. genitive "of" constructions
* [[Jacopo da Bologna]] "Jacob of [[Bologna]]"
* [[Jacques de Vitry]] "James of [[Vitry-sur-Seine]]"

In examples 1 through 3, where the noun or adjective has case [[declension]] the partial name will typically decline in accordance with normal noun or adjective rules. For example, in ''Giraldi Cambrensis opera'' - "the works of [genitive] Gerald of Wales" - ''Giraldus'' declines to ''Giraldi'' (the genitive form of Gerald) and ''cambrensis'' (nominative adjective) declines to ''cambrensis'' (genitive adjective, but the same as nominative in this example). The declension is normally not followed when citing Latin patrial names in English, "of Giraldus Cambrensis," but may cause confusion when trying to identify the nominative spellings of patrial names from Latin or Greek sources.

==Modern era examples==
Modern era examples in Europe are generally limited to nicknames, or deliberate choices of a birthplace as a penname or stagename or change of name by deed poll:
* [[Bela Lugosi]] stagename "from [[Lugoj]]"&lt;ref&gt;Transylvania: Birthplace of Vampires - Page 32 Robert Z. Cohen - 2011  This onscreen Dracula was the creation of Transylvanian-Hungarian actor Bela Lugosi. Born Béla Blaskó in the western Transylvanian city of Lugoj (his stage name means “from Lugoj” in Hungarian&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[George Brassaï]] pseudonym "from [[Braşov]]"&lt;ref&gt;European culture: a contemporary companion Jonathan Law - 1993 "His professional name means 'from Brasso', his birthplace. After studying in Budapest and Berlin he moved to Paris in 1924, where he worked as a journalist; he did not take his first photograph until the age of 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''people''' is a plurality of [[person]]s considered as a whole, as is the case with an [[ethnic group]] or [[nation]]. Collectively, for example, the contemporary [[Frisians]] and [[Danes]] are two related [[Germanic peoples]], while various [[Middle East]]ern ethnic groups are often linguistically categorized as [[Semitic people]]s.

[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' by [[Eugène Delacroix]]]]

Various [[sovereign state|states]] govern, or claim to govern, in the name of ''the people''. Both the [[Roman Republic]] and the [[Roman Empire]] used the [[Latin]] term ''[[SPQR|Senatus Populusque Romanus]]'', (the Senate and People of Rome). This term was fixed to Roman legionary standards, and even after the [[Roman Emperor]]s achieved a state of total personal [[autarchy]], they continued to wield their power in the name of the Senate and People of Rome.

A [[People's Republic]] is typically a [[Marxism|Marxist]] or [[Socialism|socialist]] [[one-party state]] that claims to govern on behalf of the people even if it in practice often turns out to be a [[dictatorship]]. [[Populism]] is another umbrella term for various political tendencies that claim to represent the people, usually with an implication that they serve the ''common people'' instead of the [[Elitism|elite]].

Chapter One, Article One of the [[Charter of the United Nations]] states that peoples have the right to [[self-determination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter1.shtml |title=Charter of the United Nations: Chapter I: Purposes and Principles |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=22 April 2013 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6YNQicd2P?url=http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter1.shtml |archive-date=8 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[criminal law]], in certain jurisdictions, criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of ''the People''. Several U.S. states, including [[California]], [[Illinois]], and [[New York (state)|New York]], use this style.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''[[People v. Anderson|California v.

LEXIS 154 (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; Citations outside the jurisdictions in question usually substitute the name of the state for the words "the People" in the case captions.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, ''[[Bluebook|The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation]]'', rule 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Four states&amp;nbsp;— [[Massachusetts]], [[Virginia]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Kentucky]]&amp;nbsp;— refer to themselves as ''the [[Commonwealth]]'' in case captions and legal process.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Commonwealth (United States)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Other states, such as [[Indiana]], typically refer to themselves as ''the State'' in case captions and legal process. Outside the United States, criminal trials in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[Philippines]] are prosecuted in the name of the people of their respective states.

The political theory underlying this format is that criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the [[sovereignty|sovereign]]; thus, in these [[U.S. states]], the "people" are judged to be the sovereign, even as in the [[United Kingdom]] and other dependencies of the [[British monarchy|British Crown]], criminal prosecutions are typically brought in the name of [[the Crown]]. "The people" identifies the entire body of the [[citizen]]s of a jurisdiction invested with political power or gathered for political purposes.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'', 5th ed., "People".&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4943">'''Production babies''' are children born to anyone involved in the making of a film during its [[filmmaking|production]]. The phrase generally refers to a section of the [[closing credits]] of films, listing the babies' [[given name]]s. The custom of publishing lists of production babies began with [[animated film]]s, and is still chiefly found in that genre, reflecting the influence of family experiences on storytelling in such films.&lt;ref name=sfgate2010/&gt;

The first list of production babies was included by [[Pixar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dawson|first=Jonathan|title=Cars|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tasmania/stories/s1664829.htm|work=Review|publisher=[[ABC Tasmania]]|accessdate=January 16, 2012|date=June 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the credits of their first full-length movie ''[[Toy Story]]'' in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0114709|Toy Story}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lee Unkrich]], a film director with Pixar, explains that the production team and [[film crew]] indelibly associate the birth of each of their children with the film they were working on at the time. The listing in the end credits becomes a way for them to share these essential memories more widely. "It's like our family lives are permanently woven into the movies."&lt;ref name=sfgate2010&gt;{{cite web|last=Hartlaub|first=Peter|title=Pixar delivers, babies get credit|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-06-13/entertainment/21907955_1_toy-story-john-lasseter-pixar|publisher=[[SFGate]]|accessdate=January 8, 2012|date=June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twists added in film credits include a list of "Chameleon Babies" at the end of the 2010 animated film ''[[Tangled]]'', born to the real-life model for the pet in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Liu|first=Ed|title=A Virtual Roundtable with "Tangled" Co-Directors Byron Howard &amp; Nathan Greno|url=http://www.toonzone.net/news/articles/36987/a-virtual-roundtable-with-tangled-co-directors-byron-howard-amp-nathan-greno|publisher=ToonZone.net|accessdate=January 16, 2012|date=April 7, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822013323/http://www.toonzone.net/news/articles/36987/a-virtual-roundtable-with-tangled-co-directors-byron-howard-amp-nathan-greno|archivedate=August 22, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 animated film ''[[Winnie the Pooh (2011 film)|Winnie the Pooh]]'' lists the names under "Pooh Babies," with the credit knitted on a piece of fabric by the character [[Kanga (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Kanga]].

[[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] film director [[Byron Howard]] cites the listing of production babies as a pointer to the depth of personal relationships established during collaboration on an animated movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hucks|first=Dustin|title=Interviews: The Cast of'' 'Tangled' ''Gets Unraveled|url=http://www.filmschoolrejects.com/features/interviews-the-cast-of-tangled-gets-unraveled.php|publisher=FilmSchoolRejects.com|accessdate=January 8, 2012|date=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A star next to a baby's name honors a baby who passed away before production was complete.

In 2009, [[Ari Folman]] dedicated his [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Golden Globe Award]] to the eight production babies born during the making of ''[[Waltz with Bashir]]'', an animated anti-war documentary, and expressed hope that their lives would have no contact with the realities of conflict depicted in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel's 'Waltz with Bashir,' on 1982 Lebanon War, wins Golden Globe for best foreign film|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel-s-waltz-with-bashir-on-1982-lebanon-war-wins-golden-globe-for-best-foreign-film-1.267916|accessdate=January 8, 2012|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|date=January 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewers have noted that "production babies" credits indicate the creativity of film people in giving some unusual names to their children.&lt;ref name=sfgate2010/&gt;

An early, isolated instance in video games occurred with an [[Easter egg (media)#Software|easter egg]] message embedded in the ROM for the 1988 game ''Spiker! Super Pro Volleyball'' for Mattel [[Intellivision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The First Production Baby|url=http://daddytypes.com/2013/01/15/the_first_production_baby.php |date=January 15, 2013 |publisher=DaddyTypes |accessdate=January 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern custom spread to [[video game]] credits in the 2005 game ''[[Call of Duty 2]]'', and the 2009 game ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]'', which also listed the other parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2/credits|work=Credits|publisher=[[MobyGames]]|accessdate=January 8, 2012|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the list was changed to "Development Babies" in ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3]]''. A number of other games have since done the same.

[[File:Roma, repubblica, moneta di p. satrienus, 77 ac..JPG|thumb|350px|The she-wolf on a coin of the late Roman republic (c.77 BC)]]
In the [[Founding of Rome|Roman foundation myth]], it was a '''she-wolf''' that nursed and sheltered the twins [[Romulus and Remus]] after they were abandoned in the wild by order of [[Amulius|King Amulius]] of [[Alba Longa]]. She cared for the infants at her den, a cave known as the [[Lupercal]], until they were discovered by a shepherd, [[Faustulus]]. [[Romulus]] would later become the founder and first king of Rome. The image of the she-wolf suckling the twins has been a symbol of [[Rome]] since ancient times and is one of the most recognizable icons of ancient mythology.&lt;ref&gt; Wiseman ''Remus'' preface pg xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
There is evidence that the wolf held a special place in the world of the ancient inhabitants of Italy.  One legend claims that the [[Hirpini]] people were so-called because, when they set out to found their first colony,  they were led to its location by a wolf (from the Sabine word for wolf: ''hirpus'').&lt;ref&gt; Strabo Book V Ch.12 (''Loeb'' pg.467) &lt;/ref&gt;  The tale of the Lupercal is central to that of the twins, and probably predates theirs. To the Roman god [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] the wolf is a sacred animal.  There is an ongoing debate about a connection to the ancient Roman festival of the [[Lupercalia]].

In [[Greek mythology]], [[Apollo]]'s mother [[Leto]] is reported to have given birth to him as a she-wolf, to evade [[Hera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Aristotle]]|accessdate=5 December 2016|title=History of Animals|url=https://www.loebclassics.com/view/aristotle-history_animals/1965/pb_LCL438.345.xml?rskey=9mJ3UR&amp;result=1&amp;mainRsKey=S0vjOz|doi=10.4159/DLCL.aristotle-history_animals.1965}} {{Subscription needed|via=[[Loeb Classical Library|digital Loeb Classical Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary sources==
The 3 "canonical" versions of the myth--those of [[Livy]], [[Plutarch]] and [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]]--all draw heavily on [[Quintus Fabius Pictor]].&lt;ref&gt; Dionysius I 79&lt;/ref&gt;  He is considered one of Rome's earliest historians and his now lost work describes the she-wolf and her episode with the twins.  The twins were abandoned at the order of Amulius.  Some tales claim that they were to be left along the riverbank, others that they were to be cast into the water. The servant charged with the task either thought better of it, or could not get close enough to do the deed because of the flooding.  Instead, he left them in the standing water that had formed at the foot of [[Palatine Hill]].  The twins were found either after their basket had been left at the foot of the fig tree, or came to rest there after floating in the water.  In each case, the she-wolf rescued them and gently cared for them in or near the Lupercal.  Later, they were discovered by local shepherds.

Dionysius reports that rains had raised the water level such that when Amulius' servant arrived at the appointed spot (around a dozen miles from Alba Longa), they left the twins in the floodwaters because they couldn't go any further.  The basket they were in floated along until the waters receded and it struck a stone, tossing them out into the mud.  The she-wolf arrived and lowered her teats to the crying babes and licked them clean of the mud.

After a shepherd happened upon the scene in the course of tending his flock, he ran to tell his companions, and a group gathered to witness the remarkable sight. The twins were clinging to her as she was their true mother. The she-wolf was nonplussed when the men began making a ruckus to scare her off. She withdrew into a cave that was sacred to the [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Greek colonists]] who had formerly lived in the area and held an altar to the nature god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]].&lt;ref&gt; Dionysius I ch.79&lt;/ref&gt;

Livy claims that the servants of Amulius dropped the twins in the standing water out of simple laziness.  The fig tree just happened to be the first spot they came to and they figured the twins would drown no matter what.  The twins cried in their basket until the waters receded and left them back on land.  The she-wolf arrived from the hills looking for a drink of water when she heard their cries.&lt;ref&gt; Livy I pp.17-19&lt;/ref&gt;

The servant was too afraid of the torrential waters to fully carry out the king's orders, according to Plutarch.  After being left on the bank, the waters rose further and swept the twins away.  It gently carried them along and then dropped them at the fig tree.&lt;ref&gt; Plutarch ''Romulus'' IV pp.99&lt;/ref&gt;

The three relay accounts wherein the term "lupa" refers not to a she-wolf, but is a slang word for prostitute.  Plutarch tells two other stories not involving the she-wolf or abandonment.  In one, the twins are fathered by [[Hercules]] after he wins a dice game.  Their mother is the unwitting "prize".  In another, the twins are switched at birth by their grandfather for a different pair of infants and secreted out of the city to be raised by shepherds and later, educated in nearby [[Gabii]].&lt;ref&gt; Plutarch ''Romulus'' IV pp.101-105&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Scan of Figurehead from Geschichte der Kunst des Alterhums band 1 (1776).png|thumb|right|Figurehead from the title page of ''Geschichte der Kunst des Alterhums''  Vol. 1 (1776) by [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]].  Winckelmann was a pioneer in the study of Graeco-Roman art and [[ancient Roman art]] in particular.  He is center, with the she-wolf suckling the twins and [[Homer]] closest to him.  The [[Sphinx]] and an [[Etruscan art|Etruscan vase]] are in the background.]]

===Earliest representation===
The "Bolsena Mirror" features a depiction of the she-wolf and the twins surrounded by human and animal figures.  Differences in interpretation have precluded virtually any consensus regarding many of its features.&lt;ref&gt; Mazzoni pp173-178&lt;/ref&gt;  This includes its age.  However, it is consistent with other such mirrors, made as bridal gifts, in 4th century BC Euritria, perhaps circa 330-340.  The famous [[Capitoline Wolf]] may be of [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] or [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Old Latin]] origin.&lt;ref&gt; Tennant p.81&lt;/ref&gt;  But, a discovery during its restoration in 2000 and [[radiocarbon dating]] has cast doubt on an ancient origin.&lt;ref name="laregina2006"&gt;Adriano La Regina,"[http://www.repubblica.it/2006/11/sezioni/spettacoli_e_cultura/lupa-scultura-roma/lupa-scultura-roma/lupa-scultura-roma.html ''Roma, l'inganno della Lupa è "nata" nel Medioevo]'' "Rome: the phony She-Wolf wasn't born until the Middle-ages" La Republica. 17 November 2006, accessed 1 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[stele]] from [[Bologna]], dated to between 350-400 BC, depicts an animal, possibly a wolf, nursing a single infant.  By 269 BC, the silver [[drachm|didrachm]] is the earliest depiction of the complete icon, with the characteristic "turning of the she-wolf's head" backward and downward at the twins.&lt;ref&gt;Rissanen p.336&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinctive imagery of the she-wolf and the twins made it more recognizable than other symbols of the city, such as [[Roma (mythology)|Roma]], the patron deity of the city, or the [[Aquila (Roman)|Roman eagle]].  That was useful as the Roman world expanded and symbols of Rome became more important in maintaining unity.&lt;ref&gt;Rissanen p.336&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1st century AD, the she-wolf was common in both Rome and the provinces.  She and the twins were featured on the elaborate [[Ara Pacis]], built in honor of [[Augustus]] and dedicated to [[Pax (goddess)|Pax]], the goddess of peace.&lt;ref&gt; Rissanen p.336-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Coins with their depiction were minted and widely circulated.  They were also produced in Roman Colonies as a way to express their own "Roman-ness".&lt;ref&gt; Rissanen p.339&lt;/ref&gt;  They have been found on personal items such as swords, buckles, lamps and statuettes as well as monuments, mosaic floors and funerary stones that date from the 1st through the 3rd centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt; Rissanen p.343-7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early middle ages===
The [[Franks Casket]], an ornately carved, [[Anglo-Saxon]] chest from the 8th–9th century, probably crafted in a monastery in Northern France, features the she-wolf and twins, along with a [[Rune|Runic]] account of the lupercal.&lt;ref&gt;Rassanen pg.356 fn.148&lt;/ref&gt; Other Anglo-Saxon [[Undley bracteate|artifacts]] and coins from the same period also feature them.&lt;ref&gt;Rassanen pg.357&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Byzantine]]s continued to use the image, and coins attributed to them have been found in various locations in [[central Asia]] at sites located in modern [[Tadjikistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]] along with an 8th-century [[Sogdiana|Sogdian]] painted mural with a she-wolf, head turned back and down, suckling two infants.&lt;ref&gt;Compareti p.304&lt;/ref&gt;

===Siena She-Wolf===
The [[Siena|Sienese]] have a traditional tale that the city was founded by [[Senius and Aschius]], another pair of twins who were also suckled by a she-wolf.  They were the sons of Remus and fled Rome after his death at the hands of their uncle Romulus.  The legend cannot be attested to prior to the Renaissance.  However, depictions of a she-wolf and twins are common in the city and some can be dated earlier.

==Lupercalia==
The [[Lupercalia]] was a very ancient festival even during Roman times.  Roman historians speculated as to its origins.  It may be associated with the god [[Lupercus]], the god of [[Pastoralism|shepherds]] and protector of flocks.  Some historians link it to the she-wolf and the Lupercal.

'''"Sing girls"''' ({{zh|c=星女郎|p=''xīng nǚ láng''}}) is a nickname for actresses who starred alongside [[Stephen Chow]], often as the main character's romantic interest.&lt;ref name=eastday&gt;{{cite web | url=http://enjoy.eastday.com/e/20071012/u1a3160012.html | title=张雨绮亲述一夜成名:30秒搞定周星驰 (Zhang Yuqi's overnight fame: 30 seconds to win over Stephen Chow) | author=邱致理 (Qiu Zhili) | publisher=南都周刊 | date=10 December 2007 | accessdate=28 June 2009|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many are young, new actresses who go on to receive considerable media attention after appearing in one of Chow's films,&lt;ref name=dayoo&gt;{{cite web | publisher=大洋 (dayoo.com) | accessdate=28 June 2009 | url=http://life.dayoo.com/fashion/200906/09/33683_7956406_5.htm | title=从"翻版张柏芝"看女星整容是非 (From "New Cecilia Cheung", seeing if female stars are having makeovers or not) | editor=许慧健 (Xu Huijian) | date=9 June 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705203656/http://life.dayoo.com/fashion/200906/09/33683_7956406_5.htm | archivedate=5 July 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and their success is often attributed to the attention brought to them by Chow&amp;mdash;[[Zhang Yuqi]], for example, has been referred to as Chow's "[[:wikt:protégée|protégée]]" after appearing in the 2007 film ''[[CJ7]]''.&lt;ref name="ChowsPlay"&gt;&lt;!--This URL should not be linked, as it appears to be copyvio, but here it is for quick reference: http://www.wu-jing.org/happenings/archives/158-Stephen-Chows-Play-CJ7.html--&gt;{{cite news |work = [[Straits Times]]|author = Boon Cheng|title = Stephen Chow's Play: CJ7|date = 6 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese word 星 ''xīng'' refers both to Chow's nickname 星爷 (''Sing Yeh'', "Grandmaster Sing")&lt;ref name=dayoo/&gt; and to [[:wikt:明星|明星]], the word for a star or [[celebrity]].

Chow has not always chosen newcomer actresses to co-star with him; for example, [[Zhao Wei|Vicki Zhao]] already had a successful music and film career when she appeared as the female lead in ''[[Shaolin Soccer]]'',&lt;ref name=eastday/&gt; and [[Gong Li]] was already famous as an "Yimou girl" ([[:zh:谋女郎|谋女郎]]) for her frequent collaboration with director [[Zhang Yimou]] before she starred in two Stephen Chow films in the early 1990s. Many times, though, starring with Chow has been a "Sing girl"'s first major role and has kick-started her career, as ''[[King of Comedy (film)|King of Comedy]]'' did for [[Cecilia Cheung]]. [[Eva Huang]] and [[Kitty Zhang]] both gained considerable attention from media and [[netizens]] after appearing in ''[[Kung Fu Hustle]]'' and ''[[CJ7]]'', respectively, even though their roles were relatively small (Huang's role had no lines at all).&lt;ref name=eastday/&gt;

[[Kingdom Yuen]] appeared in numerous 1990s Stephen Chow films not as a lead female or romantic interest, but rather in minor roles as a comedic [[stock character]].&lt;ref name=kingdom&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=4 July 2009 | url=http://www.brns.com/hkactors/pages/page48.html | title=Yuen King-tan/Kingdom Yuen | work=Hong Kong Cinema: View from the Brooklyn Bridge | first=Yves | last=Gendron | date=5 October 2004}} {{Unreliable source?|date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The youngest "Sing girl" is 7 year old Zhang Yuwen, who appears in ''[[Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hunantv.com/c/20130218/0947217139.html|title=揭秘《西游》最小星女郎 张煜雯喊星爷哥哥|publisher=Hunan TV|accessdate=2013-03-28|date=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10905">[[File:Holy Matrimony.JPG|thumb|A religious [[marriage]].]]

A '''spouse''' is a [[life partner]] in a [[marriage]], [[civil union]], or [[common-law marriage]]. The term is [[gender neutral]], whereas a male spouse is a [[husband]] and a female spouse is a [[wife]]. Although a spouse is a form of [[significant other]], the latter term also includes non-marital partners who play a social role similar to that of a spouse, but do not have rights and duties reserved by law to a spouse.

==Legal status==
{{Further information|Coverture|Marital power}}
The legal status of a spouse, and the specific rights and obligations associated with that status, vary significantly among the jurisdictions of the world. These regulations are usually described in [[family law]] statutes. However, in many parts of the world, where [[civil marriage]] is not that prevalent, there is instead customary marriage, which is usually regulated informally by the community. In many parts of the world, spousal rights and obligations are related to the payment of [[bride price]], [[dowry]] or [[dower]]. Historically, many societies have given sets of rights and obligations to male marital partners that have been very different from the sets of rights and obligations given to female marital partners. In particular, the control of marital property, inheritance rights, and the right to dictate the activities of children of the marriage, have typically been given to male marital partners. However, this practice was curtailed to a great deal in many countries in the twentieth century, and more modern statutes tend to define the rights and duties of a spouse without reference to gender.  Among the last European countries to establish full [[gender equality]] in marriage were Switzerland,&lt;ref&gt;In 1985, a referendum guaranteed women legal equality with men within marriage.[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17988450][http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html] The new reforms came into force in January 1988.''Women's movements of the world: an international directory and reference guide, edited by Sally Shreir'', p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; Greece,&lt;ref&gt;In 1983, legislation was passed guaranteeing equality between spouses, abolishing [[dowry]], and ending legal discrimination against illegitimate children [https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/26/world/around-the-world-greece-approves-family-law-changes.html#]''Demos, Vasilikie. (2007) “The Intersection of Gender, Class and Nationality and the Agency of Kytherian Greek Women.” Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association. August 11''.&lt;/ref&gt; Spain,&lt;ref&gt;In 1981, Spain abolished the requirement that married women must have their husbands’ permission to initiate judicial proceedings {{cite web |url=http://wbl.worldbank.org/~/media/FPDKM/WBL/Documents/Reports/2014/Women-Business-and-the-Law-2014-Key-Findings.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824032832/http://wbl.worldbank.org/~/media/FPDKM/WBL/Documents/Reports/2014/Women-Business-and-the-Law-2014-Key-Findings.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and France &lt;ref&gt;Although married women in France obtained the right to work without their husbands' permission in 1965,[http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/explore/cmcf-vsi-women-in-france.pdf] and the paternal authority of a man over his family was ended in 1970 (before that parental responsibilities belonged solely to the father who made all legal decisions concerning the children), it was only in 1985 that a legal reform abolished the stipulation that the husband had the sole power to administer the children's property. [https://terapiadeparejaweb.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1980s. In various [[marriage laws]] around the world, however, the husband continues to have authority; for instance the Civil Code of [[Iran]] states at Article 1105: ''"In relations between husband and wife; the position of the head of the family is the exclusive right of the husband"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.alaviandassociates.com/documents/civilcode.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170311161504/http://www.alaviandassociates.com/documents/civilcode.pdf |archive-date=2017-03-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on jurisdiction, the refusal or inability of a spouse to perform the marital obligations may constitute a [[ground for divorce]], [[legal separation]] or [[annulment]]. The latter two options are more prevalent in countries where the dominant religion is [[Roman Catholicism]], some of which introduced divorce only recently (i.e. [[Italy]] in 1970, [[Portugal]] in 1975, [[Brazil]] in 1977,  [[Spain]] in 1981, [[Argentina]] in 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-07-12/news/mn-3473_1_divorce-law|title=Divorce Is Now Legal in Argentina but, So Far, Few Couples Have Taken the Break|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paraguay]] in 1991,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;''Sex and the State: Abortion, Divorce, and the Family Under Latin. American Dictatorships and Democracies'', by Mala Htun, pp 102&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colombia]] in 1991,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''note''': divorce between 1976-1991 was allowed for non-Catholics&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ireland]] in 1996, [[Chile]] in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Chile introduces right to divorce | date = November 18, 2004 | publisher = [[BBC]] | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4021427.stm | work = BBC News | accessdate = 2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Malta]] in 2011). In recent years, many Western countries have adopted [[no fault divorce]]. In some parts of the world, the formal dissolution of a marriage is complicated by the payments and goods which have been exchanged between families (this is common where [[arranged marriage|marriages are arranged]]). This often makes it difficult to leave a marriage, especially for the woman: in some parts of Africa, once the bride price has been paid, the wife is seen as belonging to the husband and his family; and if she wants to leave, the husband may demand back the bride price that he had paid to the girl's family. The girl's family often cannot or does not want to pay it back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.equalitynow.org/sites/default/files/Protecting_the_Girl_Child.pdf |title=Protecting the Girl Child: Using the Law to End Child, Early and Forced Marriage and Related Human Rights Violations |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-05-29 |website=equalitynow.org |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}

Regardless of legislation, personal relations between spouses may also be influenced by local [[culture]] and [[religion]], which may promote male authority over the wife: for instance the word [[Wiktionary:בעל|בעל]] (ba`al), Hebrew for ''husband'', used throughout the Bible, is synonymous with ''owner'' and ''master''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/library/90607132/religion-and-sexism-images-of-woman-in-the-jewish|title=Religion and Sexism: Images of Woman in the Jewish and Christian Traditions|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minimum age==
There is often a minimum legal [[marriageable age]]. The [[United Nations Population Fund]] stated the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/MarryingTooYoung.pdf |title=Marrying Too Young - End Child Marriage |author=United Nations Population Fund UNFPA |date=2012 |website=www.unfpa.org |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"In 2010, 158 countries reported that 18 years was the minimum legal age for marriage for women without parental consent or approval by a pertinent authority. However, in 146 countries, state or customary law allows girls younger than 18 to marry with the consent of parents or other authorities; in 52 countries, girls under age 15 can marry with parental consent. In contrast, 18 is the legal age for marriage without consent among males in 180 countries. Additionally, in 105 countries, boys can marry with the consent of a parent or a pertinent authority, and in 23 countries, boys under age 15 can marry with parental consent."

==Procreation==
[[File:Kustodiev Merchants Wife.jpg|thumb|180px|''The Merchant's Wife'' (1918) by [[Boris Kustodiev]]. A wife is a spouse.]]
Although in Western countries spouses sometimes [[Childfree|choose not to have children]], such a choice is not accepted in some parts of the world.  In some cultures and religions, the quality of a spouse imposes an obligation to have children. In [[northern Ghana]], for example, the payment of bride price signifies a woman's requirement to bear children, and women using birth control are at risks of threats and coercion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bawah | first1 = Ayaga Agula | last2 = Akweongo | first2 = Patricia | last3 = Simmons | first3 = Ruth | last4 = Phillips | first4 = James F. | title = Women’s fears and men’s anxieties: the impact of family planning on gender relations in Northern Ghana | journal = [[Studies in Family Planning]] | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 54&amp;ndash;66 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] on behalf of the [[Population Council]] | date = 1999 | url = https://www.popcouncil.org/research/womens-fears-and-mens-anxieties-the-impact-of-family-planning-on-gender-rel | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.popcouncil.org/uploads/pdfs/councilarticles/sfp/SFP301Bawah.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Choosing a spouse==
There are many ways in which a spouse is chosen, which vary across the world, and include [[love marriage]], [[arranged marriage]], and [[forced marriage]]. The latter is in some jurisdictions a [[void marriage]] or a [[voidable marriage]]. Forcing someone to marry is also a criminal offense in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/12/part/10/enacted|title=Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014|work=legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2279">The '''Texas Aces''' is a name colloquially given to five [[Miss Texas USA]] titleholders who went on to win the [[Miss USA]] beauty pageant in succession from 1985-1989.

Prior to the 1980s, no other state had won more than two [[Miss USA]] pageants in succession (the only two states to win twice in succession were [[Miss Virginia USA|Virginia]] in 1969-1970 and [[Miss Illinois USA|Illinois]] from 1973-1974).  The five Texan Miss USA winners were all coached by "GuyRex", Richard Guy and Rex Holt, who held the Texas franchise from 1975.  The term was first used in 1988 after Gibbs became their fourth consecutive titleholder, with Guy referring to the four queens as "four aces in a deck of cards", with their fifth titleholder, Kim Tomes (1977) as the "wildcard".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Miss USA Contest Rewards Winners, Gurus|publisher=Associated Press|date=1988-03-02|first=Holden|last=Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year Gretchen Polhemus became the fifth and final "ace".  The term is still in use.

As well as directing the Texas pageant, GuyRex also acquired the [[Miss California USA]] franchise in 1986.  In 1988, Diana Magaña of California placed first runner-up to Gibbs, the fourth ace.  The two had both undergone extensive preparation by GuyRex, and even lived together prior to the pageant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Miss California |publisher=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=1987-08-31|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bringing Up Beauty / In the months before the Miss USA Pageant, advisers work on Miss California |publisher=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=1987-10-01|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The five Aces were:
*1985 - [[Laura Harring|Laura Martinez-Herring]] ('''Miss USA''', Semi-finalist at Miss Universe 1985)
*1986 - [[Christy Fichtner]] ('''Miss USA''', 1st runner-up at Miss Universe 1986)
*1987 - [[Michelle Royer]] ('''Miss USA''', 2nd runner-up at Miss Universe 1987)
*1988 - [[Courtney Gibbs]] ('''Miss USA''', Semi-finalist at Miss Universe 1988)
*1989 - [[Gretchen Polhemus]] ('''Miss USA''', 2nd runner-up at Miss Universe 1989)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3026">'''''Theophanes Continuatus''''' ({{lang-el|συνεχισταί Θεοφάνους}}) or '''''Scriptores post Theophanem''''' ({{lang|grc|Οἱ μετὰ Θεοφάνην}}, "those after Theophanes") is the [[Latin]] name commonly applied to a collection of historical writings preserved in the 11th-century Vat. gr. 167 manuscript.&lt;ref name="ODB2061"&gt;Kazhdan (1991), p. 2061&lt;/ref&gt; Its name derives from its role as the continuation, covering the years 813–961, of the [[chronicle]] of [[Theophanes the Confessor]], which reaches from 285 to 813. The manuscript consists of four distinct works, in style and form very unlike the [[annals|annalistic]] approach of Theophanes.&lt;ref name="ODB"&gt;Kazhdan (1991), pp. 2061–2062&lt;/ref&gt;

The first work, of four books consists of a series of biographies of the emperors reigning from 813 to 867 (from [[Leo the Armenian]] to [[Michael III]]). As they were commissioned by Emperor [[Constantine VII]] (r. 913–959), they reflect the point of view of the reigning [[Macedonian dynasty]]. The unknown author probably used the same sources as [[Genesios]].&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt; The second work is known as the ''Vita Basilii'' (Latin for "Life of Basil"), a biography of [[Basil I the Macedonian]] (r. 867–886) written by his grandson Constantine VII probably around 950. The work is essentially a [[panegyric]], praising Basil and his reign while vilifying his predecessor, Michael III.&lt;ref&gt;Kazhdan (1991), pp. 2062, 2180–2181&lt;/ref&gt; The third work is a history of the years 886–948, in form and content very close to the history of [[Symeon Logothetes]], and the final section continues it until 961. It was probably written by [[Theodore Daphnopates]], shortly before 963.&lt;ref&gt;Kazhdan (1991), p. 2062&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker''' (abbreviated to '''ZAZ''') were an American comedy filmmaking trio consisting of [[Jim Abrahams]] and brothers [[David Zucker (filmmaker)|David Zucker]] and [[Jerry Zucker (film director)|Jerry Zucker]] who specialized in writing [[slapstick comedy]] films during the 1980s. The trio knew each other during their childhood years, growing up in [[Shorewood, Wisconsin]] and attending [[Shorewood High School (Wisconsin)|Shorewood High School]] which is sometimes referenced in their work. While attending the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], the trio founded a small theater known as The Kentucky Fried Theater in 1971 which led to their [[sketch comedy]] film ''[[The Kentucky Fried Movie]]''.

This was followed in 1980 by the trio's breakout hit ''[[Airplane!]]'', which remains a revered comedic milestone. Subsequent collaborations include the TV series ''[[Police Squad!]]'', its subsequent ''[[The Naked Gun|Naked Gun]]'' trilogy and the films ''[[Top Secret!]]'' and ''[[Ruthless People]]''. All of their projects relied heavily on [[Parody|parodies]], [[visual gag]]s and [[Fourth wall|breaking of the fourth wall]], and established a strong cult following. The notable stylistic exception is ''Ruthless People'', a more traditional farce that was directed by the trio but unlike their other productions, not written by them.

Prominent ZAZ actors and actresses include [[Leslie Nielsen]], [[Lloyd Bridges]], [[Robert Stack]], [[Rowan Atkinson]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]] and [[Charlie Sheen]]. The trio's status as a three-person team of co-directors is highly unusual, although some of their later projects were directed by David Zucker working solo and with Jerry Zucker and Abrahams credited only as producers and/or writers. Each member of the group also had individual solo careers:

* David Zucker directed ''[[BASEketball]]'', ''[[My Boss's Daughter]]'', ''[[Scary Movie 3]]'' and ''[[Scary Movie 4|4]]''.
* Abrahams directed ''[[Hot Shots!]]'' and ''[[Mafia!|Jane Austen's Mafia!]]''.
* Jerry Zucker directed ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'', ''[[First Knight]]'' and ''[[Rat Race (film)|Rat Race]]''. Of the three, Jerry Zucker has found the most mainstream non-comedic success including ''Ghost'' and ''First Knight'', which grossed $505 million and $127 million worldwide respectively.

==Filmography==
&lt;!--Do NOT add Police Squad! It's a TV show, not an actual film. Also do NOT add the Naked Gun movies. They were not directed by ZAZ, only written. Thank you.!--&gt;
