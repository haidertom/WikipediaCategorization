There are '''apocryphal biographies''' in the first edition (1885–1900) of the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (DNB), a major work on historical biography related to the [[United Kingdom]]. In other words, there is a biography that presents a life of a person asserted to have existed, but (in the light of later scholarship) the evidence for the person having lived has become regarded as tenuous or non-existent.

Examples are in [[:s:Category:Apocryphal biographies]], based on the updated ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (ODNB), where the corresponding article casts serious doubt on the DNB assertions.

==Kirkman Finlay==
'''Kirkman Finlay'''—supposed: (''c.'' 1802&amp;ndash;1828) was an alleged Scottish [[philhellene]].

The DNB has an article on this man,{{sfn|Goodwin|1889|p=32}} but more modern scholarship refutes its credibility. Monica Clough in the 21st century ODNB explains how the original source for the DNB probably confused fact with fiction and concludes by citing and quoting C. R. Fay (1951):
{{quote|
Perhaps, unless new evidence is found, more reliable than the obituary in the ''Gentleman's Magazine'' of April 1828 which called him into being,{{sfn|Gentlemen's Magazine staff|1828|p=372}} 'the second quite imaginary Kirkman Finlay of the [[Dictionary of National Biography]] "who was neither killed in Greece nor born anywhere"' can be safely buried.|Monica Clough&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clough|2004}} citing C. R. Fay, Huskisson and his age (1951)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

== Robert Bruce (died 1094?) ==
Robert de Brus [Bruce] supposed nobleman, based on late medieval lists of those who fought at Hastings,{{sfn|Mackay|1886|p=114}} which are wholly unreliable.{{sfn|Cownie |2004}}

==Macduff 'thane' of Fife==
"A half or wholly mythical personage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB |wstitle=Macduff |first=Thomas Finlayson |last=Henderson |volume=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; If he is not a literary invention, then he represents a supporter of [[Malcolm III of Scotland]], descended from [[Dub, King of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|first=Dauvit|last= Broun|title=Dubh  (d. 966)|id= 8166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ariel Castro kidnappings''' took place between 2002 and 2004 when three young women — Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry, and Georgina "Gina" DeJesus — were kidnapped by Ariel Castro and held captive in his home in the [[Tremont, Cleveland|Tremont]] neighborhood of [[Cleveland]], in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Ohio]].

DeJesus and her friend, Castro's daughter Arlene, had called Figueroa for permission to have a sleepover at DeJesus's house, but Figueroa replied they could not and the two girls parted ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/05/suspects_daughter_said_in_2004.html |title=Suspect's daughter said in 2004 she was the last to see Gina DeJesus |last1=Dissell |first1=Rachel |date=May 7, 2013 |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |accessdate=May 13, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Gk6Vrz5i?url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/05/suspects_daughter_said_in_2004.html |archivedate=May 19, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arlene was the last person to see DeJesus before her disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/cleveland-kidnapping-latest-police-twice-visited-house-in-ohio--but-missed-three-women-held-captive-for-a-decade-8605381.html |title=Cleveland kidnapping: Son reveals his father padlocked doors to basement because 'we weren't allowed to go there' |last1=Kumar |first1=Nikhil |last2=Usborne |first2=David |date=May 8, 2013 |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=May 13, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508011422/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/cleveland-kidnapping-latest-police-twice-visited-house-in-ohio--but-missed-three-women-held-captive-for-a-decade-8605381.html |archivedate=May 8, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeJesus was taken under the impression that she was being dropped off, and trusted Castro because she was friends with his teenage daughter. Because no one witnessed DeJesus's abduction, an [[AMBER Alert]] was not issued, which angered DeJesus's father. He said in 2006, "The Amber Alert should work for any missing child … Whether it's an abduction or a runaway, a child needs to be found. We need to change this law".&lt;ref name="3 missing women found"/&gt;

A year after DeJesus' disappearance, the FBI released a [[composite sketch]] and description of a male suspect, described as "Latino, 25 to 35 years of age, {{convert|5|ft|10|in}}, {{convert|165|to|185|lb}}, with green eyes, a [[goatee]] and possibly a pencil-thin beard".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Swaine |first=Jon |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10045464/Ohio-abductions-FBI-photofit-with-likeness-to-suspect-Ariel-Castro-held-for-seven-years-as-police-say-he-acted-alone.html |title=Ohio abductions: FBI photofit with likeness to suspect Ariel Castro held for seven years as police say he acted alone |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=May 9, 2013 |accessdate=September 4, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608063305/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10045464/Ohio-abductions-FBI-photofit-with-likeness-to-suspect-Ariel-Castro-held-for-seven-years-as-police-say-he-acted-alone.html |archivedate=June 8, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to court records, Castro was {{convert|5|ft|7|in}}, {{convert|179|lb}}; he had brown eyes and a goatee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wkyc.com/news/story.aspx?storyid=33093 |title=Printout: FBI releases sketch of Gina DeJesus' alleged kidnapper |date=April 15, 2005 |publisher=WKYC |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10882714 |title=FBI had sketch of suspect but missed the connection |date=May 10, 2013 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Captivity==
After Knight's kidnapping, Castro took her upstairs, tied her hands and feet together, and pulled her up using her hands, feet, and neck. He left her there for three days without food. Prosecutors at Castro's sentencing wrote that diaries kept by the women "speak of forced sexual conduct, of being locked in a dark room, of anticipating the next session of abuse, of the dreams of someday escaping and being reunited with family, of being chained to a wall, of being held like a [[prisoner of war]], of missing the lives they once enjoyed, of [[Psychological abuse|emotional abuse]], of his threats to kill, of being treated like an animal, of continuous abuse, and of desiring freedom".

A [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cuyahoga County]] [[grand jury]] returned a [[Indictment|true bill]] of indictment against Castro on June 7. It contained 329 counts, including two counts of aggravated murder (under different sections of the Ohio criminal code) for his alleged role in the termination of one of the women's pregnancies. The indictments covered only the period from August 2002 to February 2007. The county prosecutor, Timothy J. McGinty, stated that the investigation was ongoing, and that any further findings would be presented to the grand jury. McGinty said that pursuing a [[death penalty]] specification would be considered following completion of indictment proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/06/ariel_castro_indicted_on_charg.html |title=Ariel Castro indicted on aggravated murder, rape, kidnapping charges |last=McCarty |first=James F. |date=June 7, 2013 |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |accessdate=September 4, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907111035/http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/06/ariel_castro_indicted_on_charg.html |archivedate=September 7, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ohio grand jury indicts man accused of kidnapping Cleveland women |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/08/us-usa-missing-ohio-idUSBRE95619F20130608?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=topNews&amp;dlvrit=992637 |last1=Palmer |first=Kim |date=June 8, 2013 |agency=Reuters |accessdate=June 9, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608025533/http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/08/us-usa-missing-ohio-idUSBRE95619F20130608?feedType=RSS |archivedate=June 8, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After entering a not guilty plea for Castro on June 12, one of his attorneys, Craig Weintraub, said that although some of the charges against Castro were indisputable, "it is our hope that we can continue to work toward a resolution to avoid having an unnecessary trial about aggravated murder and the death penalty". He noted, "We are very sensitive to the emotional strain and impact that a trial would have on the women, their families and this community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-ariel-castro-plea-20130612,0,6763994.story |title=Ariel Castro's lawyer: Some kidnap charges 'cannot be disputed' |last=Pearce |first=Matt |date=June 12, 2013 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=June 19, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615022557/http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-ariel-castro-plea-20130612,0,6763994.story |archivedate=June 15, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Castro was found competent to stand trial on July 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Accused Cleveland kidnapper ruled capable of standing trial |url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/03/justice/ohio-castro-hearing/index.html |date=July 3, 2013 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=September 4, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907063712/http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/03/justice/ohio-castro-hearing/index.html |archivedate=September 7, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 12, a Cuyahoga County grand jury returned a true bill of indictment for the remainder of the period after February 2007.

Castro pleaded guilty on July 26 to 937 of the 977 charges against him, including charges of kidnapping, rape, and aggravated murder, as part of a [[plea bargain]] which called for consecutive sentences of [[life imprisonment|life in prison]] plus 1,000 years, all without [[parole]].&lt;ref name=usat072613/&gt; Under the plea deal, Castro forfeited his right to [[appeal]], and could not profit in any way due to his crimes.

At the sentencing hearing on August 1, Castro was sentenced to consecutive life terms in prison, plus 1,000 years, all without any possibility of parole. He was also fined $100,000. The court forfeited all of his property and assets to the Cuyahoga County government.&lt;ref name=pd130801&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/08/judge_sends_ariel_castro_to_pr.html |title=Judge sends Ariel Castro to prison for abduction, rape of Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight (slideshow) |date=August 1, 2013 |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |accessdate=August 6, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130804045059/http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/08/judge_sends_ariel_castro_to_pr.html |archivedate=August 4, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before his sentencing, Castro addressed the court for twenty minutes, in which he said he was "a good person" and "not a monster", but that he was addicted to sex and pornography, and had "practiced the art of [[masturbation]]" from a young age. He claimed that he had never beaten or tortured the women, and insisted that "most" of the sex he had with them "was consensual". He shifted between an apologetic tone and blaming the FBI for failing to catch him, as well as his victims themselves, insisting to the court that when he had sex with them he discovered they were not virgins. He would alternatively shift back into apologetic comments, saying: "I hope they can find in their hearts to forgive me because we had a lot of harmony going on in that home".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wkyc.com/news/article/308810/45/STATEMENT--Read-Ariel-Castros-final-remarks-in-court |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130806234708/http://www.wkyc.com/news/article/308810/45/STATEMENT--Read-Ariel-Castros-final-remarks-in-court |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 6, 2013 |title=Ariel Castro spoke for 20 minutes in court, read what he said here |date=August 1, 2013 |publisher=WKYC |accessdate=August 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sentencing judge also heard from Knight and family members of Berry and DeJesus. Knight told Castro: "You took eleven years of my life away. I spent eleven years in hell, now your hell is just beginning. I will overcome all that has happened, but you will face hell for eternity. I will live on, you will die a little every day as you think of the eleven years of atrocities that you inflicted on us... I can forgive you, but I will never forget."&lt;ref name=pd130801/&gt;

On the evening of September 3, 2013, one month into his life sentence, Castro was found hanging with a bed sheet in his detention cell at the [[Correctional Reception Center]] in [[Orient, Ohio]].&lt;ref name="AP suicide"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ohio-man-who-held-3-women-captive-found-dead |title=Cleveland man's suicide brings little sympathy |last1=Sheeran |first1=Thomas J. |last2=Welsh-Huggins |first2=Andrew |date=September 4, 2013 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=October 3, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20131004072333/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ohio-man-who-held-3-women-captive-found-dead |archivedate=October 4, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prison staff performed [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] on Castro before he was taken to the [[Wexner Medical Center at Ohio State University|Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], where he was pronounced dead shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="AP suicide"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Woods|first=Jim|title=Ariel Castro dies in apparent suicide|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/public/2013/09/04/ariel-castro-commits-suicide-in-prison.html|newspaper=The Columbus Dispatch|date=September 4, 2013|accessdate=September 4, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906090516/http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/public/2013/09/04/ariel-castro-commits-suicide-in-prison.html|archivedate=September 6, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/04/justice/ariel-castro-cleveland-kidnapper-death/?hpt=hp_t1 |last1=Mungin |first1=Lateef |last2=Alsup |first2=Dave |publisher=CNN |date=September 4, 2013 |title=Ariel Castro, Cleveland kidnapper, found hanged in prison cell |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6JNhFIjnY?url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/04/justice/ariel-castro-cleveland-kidnapper-death/?hpt=hp_t1 |archivedate=September 4, 2013 |accessdate=September 4, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, [[Franklin County, Ohio|Franklin County]] [[coroner]] Dr. Jan Gorniak announced that a preliminary [[autopsy]] had found the cause of Castro's death to be suicide by hanging.&lt;ref name="usatoday-Eversley"&gt;{{cite news|last=Eversley|first=Melanie|title=The Ohio kidnapper was not on suicide watch, but was checked on every 30 minutes by guards.|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/04/ariel-castro-hung-prison/2761177/|accessdate=September 4, 2013|newspaper=USA Today|date=September 4, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904195004/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/04/ariel-castro-hung-prison/2761177/|archivedate=September 4, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 10, 2013, the [[Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction]] released a report that suggested Castro may have died accidentally from auto-[[erotic asphyxiation]] rather than suicide. Gorniak rejected the possibility, standing by her ruling of suicide. The report also said two prison guards had falsified logs documenting their observation of Castro hours before he was found dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Castro suicide report: Officers falsified reports|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2013/10/10/Ariel-Castro-suicide-report.html|publisher=The Columbus Dispatch|accessdate=October 10, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010150554/http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2013/10/10/Ariel-Castro-suicide-report.html|archivedate=October 10, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castro was not on [[suicide watch]] at the time of his death, but had been subject to routine checks every thirty minutes due to his notoriety.&lt;ref name="AP suicide"/&gt;

A consultant's report was released on December 3, and officially concluded that "all available evidence pointed to suicide, including a shrine-like arrangement of family pictures and a Bible in Castro's cell, an increasing tone of frustration in his prison journal and the reality of spending the rest of his life in prison while subject to constant harassment." The [[Ohio State Highway Patrol]] also reviewed the case and reached the same conclusion.&lt;ref name="suiciderpt"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/03/consultants-ariel-castro-death-suicide/3850515/ |title=Consultants: Kidnapper Ariel Castro's death a suicide |last=Welsh-Huggins |first1=Andrew |date=December 3, 2013 |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=USA Today |accessdate=October 3, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206061146/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/03/consultants-ariel-castro-death-suicide/3850515/ |archivedate=December 6, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five of the fourteen captives in this group repatriated to Saudi captivity on November 9, 2007 were among the eleven former Guantanamo captives to be listed on the 85 men on the [[Saudi list of most wanted suspected terrorists]], published on February 3, 2009.
One of the cohort, [[Said Ali al-Shihri]], became second in command of [[Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]].

According to [[Peter Taylor (journalist)|Peter Taylor]], reporting for the ''BBC'', his team found that the cohort of Saudis repatriated in November 2007 problematic.&lt;ref name=Bbc2010-10-13/&gt;
He reported that many of these captives were not rehabilitated.
He reported that five of the fourteen men in batch 10 escaped to [[Yemen]], and joined jihadists there.
The version of the men's names were [[Mohammed al-Awfi]], [[Said al-Shihri]], [[Yussef al-Shihri]], [[Murtadha Ali Saeed Magram]] and [[Turki Meshawi Zayid al-Assiri]].
Said al-Shihri and Mohammed al-Awfi appeared in an alarming video in January 2009.  Said al-Shihri took a leadership role in [[Al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula]].
Yussef al-Shihri was killed in a shoot-out with Saudi security officials.  He is alleged to have tried to cross the Saudi border dressed in a [[Burkha]], an all-encompassing female garment, armed with a suicide belt.
Taylor reports that Murtadha Ali Saeed Magram and Turki Meshawi Zayid al-Assiri remain at large.
The other nine men repatriated in batch 10 were:
[[Zaid Muhamamd Sa'id Al Husayn]],
[[Sultan Ahmed Dirdeer Musa Al Uwaydha]],
[[Khalid Saud Abd Al Rahman Al Bawardi]],
[[Faha Sultan]],
[[Fahd Umr Abd Al Majid Al Sharif]],

The '''Bolton 7''' were a group of [[gay]] and [[bisexual]] men who were convicted on 12 January 1998 before Judge Michael Lever at [[Bolton]] Crown Court of the offences of gross indecency under the [[Sexual Offences Act 1956]] and of [[age of consent]] offences under the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]]. Although [[Gay sexual practices|gay sex]] was partially decriminalised by the [[Sexual Offences Act 1967]], they were all convicted under section 13 of the 1956 Act because more than two men had sex together, which was still illegal. One of the participants (Craig Turner) was also six months under the statutory [[age of consent]] for [[Gay sexual practices|gay sex]] which was 18 at the time. 

==Offences==
Under the provisions of the 1967 Act, the [[age of consent]] for [[Gay sexual practices|gay sex]] was different from that of the [[heterosexual]] [[age of consent]] of 16, and had only been reduced from 21 to 18 by the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]]. Equivalent [[heterosexual]] behaviour was not a crime.&lt;ref name=Dearden1999 &gt;{{Cite journal | last = Dearden | first = Nick | title = The Queen and the 'Bolton Seven' | journal = [[Feminist Legal Studies]] | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 317-332 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1023/A:1009218800557 | date = October 1999 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1009218800557 | quote= This note examines the case of a group of gay men who, having engaged in consensual sexual acts together, became known as the `Bolton Seven’ following their conviction in 1998 for offences of buggery and/or gross indecency. More particularly the note scrutinises the implications of the ages of the participants (one of whom, at 17 , was unable to give lawful consent to sexual intercourse with a man) in the light of the enactment of Part I of the Sex Offenders Act 1997 which introduces a system of compulsory registration by some convicted and cautioned sex offenders with the police (including men convicted of, or cautioned for, buggery or gross indecency). The note explores the justification for inclusion of these offences within the remit of the 1997 Act together with the cultural construction of gay men as predatory and as constituting a risk to younger members of society. It also analyses some of the effects of the registration requirement in terms of it constituting a potential violation of fundamental rights such as equality and respect for private life. This discussion is located particularly within the context of the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights and the introduction of the Human Rights Act 1998 in the U.K. | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The offences only came to light after police seized videos of the men having sex, which they had filmed for their own personal use. All the men were either lovers, ex-boyfriends, or friends of friends.

==Sentences==
During [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]] on 20 February 1998 Gary Abdie, David Godfrey, Mark Love and Jonathan Moore (all of whom were in their early 20s), and Craig Turner (17 at the time of the offences but 18 when he appeared in court) were given [[probation]] and [[community service]] orders. The Judge gave Norman Williams a two-year [[suspended sentence|suspended prison sentence]] and Terry Connell received a nine-month suspended sentence and was ordered to pay £500 towards the cost of the prosecution. Moore (20), Williams (33) and Connell (55) were also required to sign the Sex Offenders Register for the [[age of consent]] offences committed with Turner. Estimates of the overall cost of the prosecution were in the region of £500,000.

Despite their convictions, none of them received custodial sentences possibly as a  result of a high-profile campaign led by gay [[human rights]] group [[OutRage!]]. Over 400 letters were presented to the court in support of the men including those from MPs, Bishops and [[human rights]] groups. The letters urged the judge not to impose a custodial sentence, with one group, [[Amnesty International]], pledging to declare the men prisoners of conscience should they be imprisoned.

==Aftermath==
In 2000, six of the men appealed to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] arguing that the prosecutions against them had violated their rights under the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] by interfering with 'the right to respect for a private family life' enshrined in article 8  of the Convention. They were subsequently awarded compensation. As Williams was not part of the litigation, he was not deemed eligible by the Home Office for the compensation.

Legislation subsequently introduced by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Government has broadly equalised the treatment of [[homosexual]] and [[heterosexual]] behaviours in criminal law. The [[Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000]] equalised the [[age of consent]] for [[Gay sexual practices|gay sex]] with that of the [[heterosexual]] [[age of consent]] which is now 16 for both. The [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]], though subject to some controversy, introduced an overhaul in the way sexual offences are dealt with by the police and courts, replacing provisions that date as far back to the 1956 legislation. The offences of gross indecency and [[buggery]] have been repealed and sexual activity between more than two men is no longer a [[crime in the United Kingdom]].

The '''Chauffeurs de la Drome''' (The Heaters of Drome) was a gang of four French criminals who were responsible for a wave of [[theft]], [[torture]], and [[murder]] in the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Drôme]] in southeast France during the early years of the twentieth century.

Three were [[execution|executed]] in September 1909; the fourth died at the [[penal colony]] on [[Devil's Island]], [[French Guiana]], where he had been sentenced to [[life imprisonment]].

==Criminal career==
The four men were Octave-Louis David (b.1873), Pierre-Augustin-Louis Berruyer (b.1873), both shoemakers; Urban-Célestin Liottard (b.1863), a labourer, and Jean Lamarque.

David had a long criminal career and was claimed to be the ringleader. He had met Lamarque in prison, and through him met Berruyer. Beurruyer's house in [[Romans-sur-Isère]] was where Lamarque and the fourth man, Liottard, lived as boarders.&lt;ref name="romanshistorique" /&gt;

The gang typically carried out [[home invasion]]s on remote, rural dwellings, where they tortured householders into revealing the locations of hidden valuables by burning their feet. This form of [[banditry]] was not unknown in France; criminals who did this were widely known as ''[[Chauffeur (criminal)|chauffeurs]] (heaters).&lt;ref name="Anderson2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Malcolm Anderson|title=In Thrall to Political Change: Police and Gendarmerie in France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CYqKByxmueEC&amp;pg=PA53|date=25 August 2011|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-969364-1|pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Chauffeurs de la Drome'' were responsible for as many as 18 murders between 1905 and 1908.&lt;ref name="Anderson2011" /&gt; They were able to avoid suspicion by maintaining their legitimate occupations during the day, carrying out attacks at night.

==Arrest, trial and execution==
[[File:Execution of Liottard and Berruyer and David in 1909 2.jpg|thumb|right|David, the first to be executed, being led to the guillotine. Valence, 22 September 1909&lt;ref name="Le carnet de l'abolition" /&gt;]]
Berruyer was arrested on 22&amp;nbsp;October 1908 at his house; a search of the house revealed a large cache of stolen items. Liottard and David were arrested soon after but the fourth man, Lamarque, escaped. Their eight-day trial began at [[Valence, Drôme]] on 2&amp;nbsp;July 1909.&lt;ref name="romanshistorique"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.romanshistorique.fr/romans-sur-isere-la-maison-des-chauffeurs-de-la-drome-rue-pecherie | title=La maison des Chauffeurs de la Drôme, rue Pêcherie | publisher=Romans Historique | language=French | date=26 May 2010 | access-date=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; All four men were convicted and sentenced to death. [[Armand Fallières]], the [[President of France]] at the time, was personally opposed to the [[death penalty]], but the strength of public opinion made it impossible for him to accept their pleas for [[clemency]].

The executions by [[guillotine]] of David, Berruyer and Liottard took place at Valence, Drôme, on 22&amp;nbsp;September 1909&lt;ref name="Histoires de bourreaux" /&gt; at 6&amp;nbsp;am, within the space of a few minutes and before a cheering crowd. A number of photographs were taken despite this being against the law; postcards were widely sold, and there were newspaper advertisements for public showings of motion pictures of the executions.&lt;ref name="Histoires de bourreaux"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://histoiresdebourreaux.blogspot.co.uk/2009/09/22-septembre-1909-lexecution-des.html | title=Histoires de bourreaux |trans-title=| language=French | date=22 September 2009 | access-date=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lamarque was captured in 1910. He had been sentenced to death [[''in absentia'']], but after his capture his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment with [[hard labour]] in the penal colony at [[Devil's Island]].&lt;ref name="Le carnet de l'abolition"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://abolition.hypotheses.org/796 | title=Quatorze photos pour une exécution | language=French | publisher=Le carnet de l'abolition | date=10 September 2012 | access-date=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Ciguapa''' (pronounced see-GWAH-pah) is a mythological creature of [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] and [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] folklore. They are commonly described as having human female form with brown or dark blue skin, backward facing feet, and very long manes of smooth, glossy hair that covers their otherwise naked bodies. They supposedly inhabit the high mountains of the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.

== Overview ==
These creatures have nocturnal habits. Also, due to the position of their feet, one can never quite tell from which direction the beings are moving from by looking at their footprints. Some people believe that they bring death, and it is said that one should not look them in the eye,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Liza Phoenix| url=http://www.lizaphoenix.com/encyclopedia/ciguapa.shtml| title= Ciguapa| publisher= lizaphoenix| date=2007-03-05 | accessdate=2007-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; otherwise the person is at risk of being bewitched permanently. Also, the only vocalization made by ciguapas is said to be a kind of whine or chirping.

Ciguapas are considered to be magical beings, beautiful in appearance to some, yet horrendous to others. All sources agree that they are wild creatures. They are compared in many cases to mermaids: beautiful yet cruel, and far from innocent. Deceitful and ready to capture the wayward traveler, they are said that they are so beautiful as to lure men into the forest, even though following footprints is misleading, to make love with them only to kill them afterwards. Even today, one can still find inhabitants who confirm having sighted a ciguapa.

Lore states that the only way to capture a ciguapa is by tracking them at night, during a [[full moon]], with a black and white [[polydactylic]]  dog (called ''cinqueño'' dog).&lt;ref&gt;http://mipais.jmarcano.com/cultura/mitos/ciguapa.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Though many believe that the myth of the ciguapa is of [[Taíno people|Taino]] origin, it has been argued that is probably of more recent concoction, being possibly attributed to African beliefs brought to the island by enslaved peoples during the colonial period. More to the point, no known Taino artifacts or lore make reference to any creature even remotely similar to it.&lt;ref&gt;http://mipais.jmarcano.com/cultura/mitos/ciguapa.html&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the legend may have originated from other myths, as distant as the [[Guarani people|Guaraní]] ''Curupí'' or the [[Hindu]] [[Churel]], which was described by [[Rudyard Kipling]] in ''My Own True Ghost Story'' as having traits amazingly similar to those of the ciguapa. Nonetheless, the Hindu hypothesis may be far-fetched since there is no way to ascertain how this story got to the Dominican Republic during the nineteenth century, when no cultural exchange whatsoever occurred between these nations.

A Dominican film called "''El Mito de la Ciguapa''" (The Myth of the Ciguapa) is set to be produced by [[Xenda Films]].

The '''coat of arms of the [[Kingdom of Sweden]]''' ({{lang-sv|Sveriges riksvapen}}) has a lesser and a greater version.

== Regulated usage ==
The usage of the coats of arms is regulated by Swedish Law, [[Swedish Code of Statutes|Act]] [http://www.notisum.se/rnp/sls/lag/19700498.HTM 1970:498], which states (in unofficial translation) that "in commercial activities, the coats of arms, the flag or other official insignia of Sweden may not be used in a trademark or other insignias for products or services without proper authorisation. This includes any mark or text referring to the Swedish State which this can give the commercial mark a sign of official endorsement. This includes municipal coats of arms which are registered."

Any representation consisting of three crowns ordered two above one are considered to be the lesser coat of arms, and its usage is therefore restricted by law 1970:498.

==Variants==
The arms of Sweden were first formally codified by law in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/rikskal/1909/0002.html|title=i (Svensk rikskalender / 1909)|website=Runeberg.org|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law also formally codifies the differences between the "greater" and "lesser" arms. The present law prescribing the two arms dates from 1982.

===Greater version===
The greater coat of arms is blazoned in Swedish law as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''A shield [[azure (heraldry)|azure]], quartered by a cross [[Or (heraldry)|Or]] with outbent arms, and an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|inescutcheon]] containing the dynastic arms of the Royal House. In the first and fourth fields three [[Crown (heraldry)|open crowns]] Or, placed two above one. In the second and third fields three sinisterbendwise streams [[argent]], a [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]] crowned with an open crown Or armed [[gules]]. The inescutcheon is [[Division of the field|party per pale]] the arms for the [[House of Vasa]] (Bendwise azure, argent and gules, a ''vasa'' Or); and the [[House of Bernadotte]] (Azure, issuant from a wavy base a bridge with three arches and two towers embattled argent, in honor point an eagle regardant with wings inverted resting on thunderbolts Or, and in chief the Big Dipper constellation of the same). The main shield is crowned by a royal crown and surrounded by the insignia of the [[Order of the Seraphim]]. [[Supporters|Supported]] by two lions regardant, crowned and with forked tails Or armed gules, standing on a [[Compartment (heraldry)|compartment]] Or. All surrounded by [[Ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] mantling, crowned with a royal crown and tied up with tasseladorned strings Or.''&lt;ref&gt;Original text of Swedish statute 1982:268, 2 §, states: ''Stora riksvapnet utgörs av en blå huvudsköld, kvadrerad genom ett kors av guld med utböjda armar, samt en hjärtsköld som innehåller det kungliga husets dynastivapen. Huvudsköldens första och fjärde fält innehåller tre öppna kronor av guld, ordnade två över en. Huvudsköldens andra och tredje fält innehåller tre ginbalksvis gående strömmar av silver, överlagda med ett upprest, med öppen krona krönt lejon av guld med röd tunga samt röda tänder och klor. Hjärtskölden är kluven. Första fältet innehåller Vasaättens vapen: ett i blått, silver och rött styckat fält, belagt med en vase av guld. Andra fältet innehåller ätten Bernadottes vapen: i blått fält en ur vatten uppskjutande bro med tre valv och två krenelerade torn, allt av silver, däröver en örn av guld med vänstervänt huvud och sänkta vingar gripande om en åskvigg av guld samt överst Karlavagnens stjärnbild av guld. Huvudskölden är krönt med en kunglig krona och omges av Serafimer ordens insignier. Sköldhållare är två tillbakaseende, med kunglig krona krönta lejon med kluvna svansar samt röda tungor, tänder och klor. Lejonen står på ett postament av guld. Det hela omges av en med kunglig krona krönt hermelinsfodrad vapenmantel av purpur med frans av guld och uppknuten med tofsprydda snören av guld. Stora riksvapnet får brukas även utan ordensinsignier, sköldhållare, postament eller vapenmantel.''

The greater arms may also be displayed only with the crowned escutcheon. While the arms have undergone significant changes over the years, such as changing the inescutcheon with the ruling dynasty, they are based on arms created by King [[Charles VIII of Sweden|Karl Knutsson]] in 1448.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] used in the greater blazon has in total five elements: 4 [[Quartering (heraldry)|quarterings]] on the main escutcheon (two coats of arms duplicated), and three coat of arms incorporated into an escutcheon of pretense. However, Bernadotte never used any stars in the arms of Pontecorvo (neither as Prince of Pontecorvo, nor as King of Sweden and Norway). The stars were introduced as an element in the royal coat of arms in the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Berghman |first=Arvid |title=Dynastien Bernadottes vapen och det svenska riksvapnet |series=Skrifter / utgivna av Riksheraldikerämbetet, 99-2298099-1 ; 1 |year=1944 |publisher=Svensk litteratur |location=Stockholm |language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; chosen as a symbol of Sweden's eternal existence, as in the poem by [[Esaias Tegnér]]:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;As long as [[Charles's Wain]] still turns,
Its golden wheels around the Northern zone,
As long as the land still produces iron and heroes,
Intact shall stand the ancient Swedish throne.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

This symbol became especially popular through its allusion to the name that had been borne by so many famous Swedish kings. [[Ursa Major]], or as it is called in Swedish, ''Karlavagnen'' (Charles' Wain), adds a Swedish accent to the Bernadotte dynastic coat of arms much in the same way as do the Vasa arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theheraldrysociety.com/articles/early_history_of_heraldry/the_three_crowns_of_sweden.htm|title=The Heraldry Society|website=Theheraldrysociety.com|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Personal command-sign of the King of Sweden.svg|thumb|left|The personal command sign, for military use, of the King is a rendition of the emblazonment of the greater arms. Introduced by royal regulation in 1943, it has only been created once.]]

The arms are supported by two lions with forked tails (''queue fourchée''), facing away from the shield and crowned with Royal Crowns. For centuries, the lion has been an important element in Swedish heraldry and especially for the State Coat of Arms. The shield may be surmounted by the Collar of the [[Order of Seraphim]], the foremost order in Sweden, and the highest honour the Swedish state can bestow on an individual.&lt;ref&gt;See sections 2 and 3, Lag No. 268 om Sveriges Riksvapen of April 29, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides being the official national coat of arms, the greater coat of arms is also the personal coat of arms of the king, and as such he can decree its use as a personal coat of arms by other members of the [[House of Bernadotte|Royal House]], with the alterations and additions decided by him.

[[Blazon]]: "The greater state arms consist of a head shield azure, quartered by a cross or with outbent arms, and an [[inescutcheon]] containing the dynastic arms of the Royal House.

In the first and fourth fields three coronets or, placed two above one. In the second and third fields three sinisterbendwise streams argent, a lion crowned with an open crown or with armaments gules. The inescutcheon is party per pale the arms for the [[House of Vasa]] and the [[House of Bernadotte]]. The main shield is crowned by a royal crown and surrounded by the insignia of the [[Order of the Seraphim]]. Supported by two lions regardant or crowned, with parted tails and armaments gules, standing on a postament. All surrounded by hermine mantling crowned with a royal crown and tied up with tasseled strings or."

===Lesser version===
The lesser coat of arms is mainly used by the [[Government of Sweden]] and subordinate government authorities. As such it may be joined by insignias symbolising the activity of individual government agencies, following approval by the State Board of Heraldry. It is, for instance, embroidered on all [[Swedish police]] uniforms and in various coats of arms of the [[Swedish Armed Forces]].

Blazon: "Azure, with three coronets Or, ordered two above one." Crowned with a royal crown. The shield may also be surrounded by the insignias of the [[Order of the Seraphim]]."

The '''Coat of arms of the Prince of Spain''' was set out in the Spanish Decree 814 of 22 April 1971, by which the Rules for Flags, Standards, Guidons, Banners, and Badges were adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-1971-554 ''Spanish Decree 814 of 22nd April 1971''].

==Blazon==
The shield was divided into four quarters, blazoned as follows:

*1st, [[gules]] a castle [[Or (heraldry)|or]], triple-embattled and voided gate and windows, with three towers each triple-turreted, of the field, masoned [[sable]] and ajoure [[azure (heraldry)|azure]], which was for [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]];
*2nd, [[argent]] a lion [[rampant]] purpure crowned or, langued and armed, of the second, which was for [[Kingdom of León|León]];
*3rd, or, four pallets gules, which was for [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]];
*4th, gules a cross, saltire and orle of chains linked together or, a centre point vert, which was for [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]];

Argent enté en point, with a pomegranate proper seeded gules, supported, sculpted and leafed in two leaves vert, which was for [[Kingdom of Granada (Crown of Castile)|Granada]].

Inescutcheon [[azure (heraldry)|azure]] [[bordure]] gules, three [[fleurs-de-lys]] or, which was for [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon-Anjou]].

Joined to the shield, the red saltire of [[Cross of Burgundy|Burgundy]] and, to the dexter and sinister of the base point, the yoke gules in its natural position with ribbons, of the field, and the sheaf of five arrows gules with the arrowheads inverted and ribbons, of the field, which used to be the symbol of the [[Catholic Monarchs]] of Spain.

All surrounded by the chain of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece|Golden Fleece]] and crowned with a crown of the same metal and precious stones, with eight rosettes, five visible, and eight pearls interspersed, closed at the top by four diadems also adorned with pearls and surmounted by a cross on a globe, which is the crown of the prince.

A '''deed of change of name''' is a legal document—used in the United Kingdom, Ireland and some other countries with [[legal system]]s based on English [[common law]]—for an official [[name change]] by a person or family. It is one use of a [[deed poll]].

Some organisations, such as government departments issuing passports and driving licences, may not recognise a name change without documentation, such as a deed or [[statutory declaration]]. However, an official document is not a legal requirement for a valid name change&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/overview&lt;/ref&gt; according to common law.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1994/604/note/made&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal procedure==
===United Kingdom===
In [[England and Wales]], such a deed may be registered in the Central Office of the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales|High Court]]. Deeds so registered are advertised in the ''[[London Gazette]]''. A deed of name change on behalf of a minor must be approved by the [[Judiciary of England and Wales|Senior Master]] on behalf of the [[Master of the Rolls]] who will take into account the child's [[best interests]]. A deed poll can also be used to change a child's name, as long as everyone with parental responsibility for the child consents to it&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Change a child’s name|url=https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/change-a-childs-name|website=GOV.UK|accessdate=31 January 2015|quote=To change the name of a child aged under 16 (sometimes called a ‘minor’) you’ll need either: the agreement of everyone with parental responsibility [or] a court order}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the child does not object to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Changing your name|url=http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/england/relationships_e/relationships_birth_certificates_and_changing_your_name_e/changing_your_name.htm|website=AdviceGuide UK|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Registration of deeds is regulated by the ''Enrolment of Deeds (Change of Name) Regulations 1994'', [[Statutory Instrument|SI]] 1994/604&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legislation.data.gov.uk/cy/uksi/1994/604/made/data.htm?wrap=true |title=Enrolment of Deeds (Change of Name) Regulations 1994 |publisher=HM Government|website=legislation.data.gov.uk |date=4 July 2011 |accessdate=10 December 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; (as amended&lt;ref&gt;[https://deedpolloffice.com/change-name/enrolling/enrolment-regulations/1994 Enrolment of Deeds (Change of Name) Regulations 1994 SI 1994/604 (as amended)]&lt;/ref&gt;)
. Compared to some other European countries, for example Germany, a name change in the UK is easy and virtually unrestricted regarding choice.

Registration of a deed of change of name is not a legal requirement in the United Kingdom. A standard legal document, with stock wording, filled in by the person making the deed poll, and signed in presence of a [[witness]], carries sufficient legal [[authority]] to be recognised. The witness need not be a solicitor but can be anyone over the age of 18 independent of the person changing their name.

The procedure, requirements and law surrounding the issue in [[Northern Ireland]] are similar to those in England and Wales.
In England, Northern Ireland and Wales, a deed of change of name will not change the name on a birth certificate. For instance, when applying for a passport, both the certificate and the deed would need to be presented as documents of identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/614120/Guidance_Booklet_March_2017__ILB_44_03.17_.pdf |title=Applying for a Passport |publisher=HM Passport Office |accessdate=18 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Northern Ireland, for children between the ages of two and eighteen years, only one change of forename(s) and one change of surname may be recorded. In Scotland, it is also possible to record a change of name on the original birth register entry at the General Register Office.  However, only one change of forename and three changes of surname are permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files2/registration/rcn1.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614150953/http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files2/registration/rcn1.pdf |archivedate=14 June 2011 |title=Recording changes of forename(s) and surname(s) in Scotland |publisher=General Register Office for Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republic of Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], a deed poll of change of name ({{lang-ga|Athrú Ainm de réir Gníomhais Aonpháirtí}}) is obtainable from the Central Office of the [[Four Courts]], Dublin at a cost of €30. Like in the UK, there are very few restrictions on name changes. One is that foreign nationals must also obtain a change of name license from the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service. One of Ireland's most noted name changers was the politician [[Seán Dublin Bay Rockall Loftus|Seán Loftus]], who repeatedly added middle names referring to his political views so that they would appear on election ballot papers.

==History==
In ''re Parrott, Cox v Parrott'' [1946] Ch 183,&lt;ref&gt;[https://deedpolloffice.com/change-name/law/case-law/Re-Parrott-Cox-v-Parrott-1946-Ch-183 ''Re'' Parrott, Cox ''v'' Parrott &lt;nowiki&gt;[1946]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Ch 183]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harry Vaisey|Mr Justice Vaisey]] stated that he did not believe that a deed poll could be used to change a person's [[Christian name]] (first name) &amp;ndash; that could be done by only an [[Act of Parliament]]. Deeds that change a person's first name can be registered by the applicant in the Enrolment Books of the Senior Courts of England and Wales, which is located within the Royal Courts of Justice on Strand, London, and they are usually endorsed "Notwithstanding the decision of Mr Justice Vaisey in ''re Parrott, Cox v Parrott'', the applicant wishes the enrolment to proceed".

'''Edward Estlin''' "'''E.&amp;nbsp;E.'''" '''Cummings''' (October 14, 1894&amp;nbsp;– September 3, 1962), often styled as '''e&amp;nbsp;e&amp;nbsp;cummings''', as he is attributed in many of his published works,&lt;ref name="chicago84"/&gt; was an American poet, painter, essayist, author, and playwright. He wrote approximately 2,900 poems, two autobiographical novels, four plays, and several essays.

Cummings is associated with [[Modernist literature|modernist]] [[free verse|free-form poetry]]. Much of his work has original syntax and uses lower case spellings for poetic expression. His use of lower case extended to rendering even the personal pronoun ''I'' as ''i'', as in the phrase "i shall go". Cummings was politically neutral much of his life until the rise of the [[Cold War]] when he became a Republican and a supporter of [[Joseph McCarthy]]. He taught briefly at Harvard University in the 1950s, before his death in 1962.

==Life==

===Early years===
Edward Estlin Cummings was born on October 14, 1894, in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], to Edward Cummings and the former Rebecca Haswell Clarke, a well-known [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] couple in the city. His father was a professor at Harvard University and later became nationally known as the minister of South Congregational Church (Unitarian) in Boston, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Leo W. ''This is Our Church''. Boston, Massachusetts: Society of the First Church in Boston, 2005: 104.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, who loved to spend time with her children, played games with Cummings and his sister, Elizabeth. From an early age, Cummings' parents supported his creative gifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/cummings/cummings_life.htm|title=E. E. Cummings' Life|website=english.illinois.edu|access-date=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cummings wrote poems and also drew as a child, and he often played outdoors with the many other children who lived in his neighborhood. He grew up in the company of such family friends as the philosophers [[William James]] and [[Josiah Royce]]. Many of Cummings' summers were spent on [[Silver Lake (Madison, New Hampshire)|Silver Lake]] in [[Madison, New Hampshire]], where his father had built two houses along the eastern shore. The family ultimately purchased the nearby [[Joy Farm]] where Cummings had his primary summer residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wpkDRPueLiMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=E.E. Cummings: A Biography|first=Christopher|last=Sawyer-Lauçanno|date=January 1, 2004|publisher=Sourcebooks, Inc.|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He expressed [[transcendentalism|transcendental]] leanings his entire life. As he matured, Cummings moved to an [[I and Thou|"I, Thou"]] relationship with God. His journals are replete with references to ''"le bon Dieu"'', as well as prayers for inspiration in his poetry and artwork (such as "Bon Dieu! may I some day do something truly great. amen."). Cummings "also prayed for strength to be his essential self ('may I be I is the only prayer—not may I be great or good or beautiful or wise or strong'), and for relief of spirit in times of depression ('almighty God! I thank thee for my soul; &amp; may I never die spiritually into a mere mind through disease of loneliness')."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/unitarians/cummings.html |title=E.

Cummings wanted to be a poet from childhood and wrote poetry daily from age 8 to 22, exploring assorted forms. He graduated from [[Harvard University]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree ''[[magna cum laude]]'' and [[Phi Beta Kappa]] in 1915 and received a [[Master of Arts]] degree from the university in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/Co-Da/Cummings-E-E.html |title=E.

Cummings Biography – life, family, children, story, death, wife, mother, book, old, information, born |publisher=Notablebiographies.com |date=September 3, 1962 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his studies at Harvard, he developed an interest in modern poetry, which ignored conventional grammar and syntax, while aiming for a dynamic use of language. Upon graduating, he worked for a book dealer.&lt;ref Name="PoetryF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/e-e-cummings|title=E. E. Cummings|date=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Harvard Monthly vol 56.jpg|thumb|right|Masthead from volume 56 of ''[[The Harvard Monthly]]''; Cummings was an editor and contributor to this literary journal while at Harvard]]

===War years===
In 1917, with the First World War ongoing in Europe, Cummings enlisted in the [[AFS Intercultural Programs#WWI|Norton-Harjes Ambulance Corps]]. On the boat to France, he met William Slater Brown. They became fast friends. Due to an administrative mix-up, Cummings and Brown were not assigned to an ambulance unit for five weeks, during which time the two of them explored Paris. He fell in love with the city, to which he would return throughout his life.&lt;ref name=utexas&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.hrc.utexas.edu:8080/hrcxtf/view?docId=ead/00030.xml|title=E. E. Cummings: An Inventory of His Collection at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center|publisher=Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center |accessdate=May 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During their service in the ambulance corps, the two young writers sent letters home that drew the attention of the military censors. They were known to prefer the company of French soldiers over fellow ambulance drivers. The two openly expressed anti-war views; Cummings spoke of his lack of hatred for the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Norman "Cummings, E[dward] E[stlin]", in Steven Serafin, ''The Continuum Encyclopedia of American Literature'', 2003, Continuum, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 21, 1917, five months after starting his belated assignment, Cummings and William Slater Brown were arrested by the French military on suspicion of espionage and undesirable activities. They were held for three and a half months in a military detention camp at the ''[[La Ferté-Macé|Dépôt de Triage]]'', in [[La Ferté-Macé]], Orne, Normandy.&lt;ref name=utexas/&gt;

They were imprisoned with other detainees in a large room. Cummings' father failed to obtain his son's release through diplomatic channels, and in December 1917 he wrote a letter to President [[Woodrow Wilson]]. Cummings was released on December 19, 1917, and Brown was released two months later. Cummings used his prison experience as the basis for his novel, ''[[The Enormous Room]]'' (1922), about which [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] said, "Of all the work by young men who have sprung up since 1920 one book survives—''The Enormous Room'' by e e cummings... Those few who cause books to live have not been able to endure the thought of its mortality."&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, p. 1814.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Did F Scott Fitzgerald use upper- or lower-case for Cummings' name?  In a direct quote, it matters. --&gt;

Cummings returned to the United States on New Year's Day 1918. Later in 1918 he was drafted into the army. He served in the [[12th Division (United States)|12th Division]] at [[Camp Devens|Camp Devens, Massachusetts]], until November 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freepages.military.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~worldwarone/WWI/divisions.html#Twelfth|title=Data on U.S. Army Divisions during World War I, WWI, The Great War}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 |source ="Buffalo Bill's" (1920)}}

===Post-war years===
Cummings returned to Paris in 1921 and had lived there for two years before returning to New York. His collection ''Tulips and Chimneys'' was published in 1923 and his inventive use of grammar and syntax is evident. The book was heavily cut by his editor. ''XLI Poems'' was published in 1925. With these collections, Cummings made his reputation as an avant garde poet.&lt;ref Name="PoetryF"/&gt;

During the rest of the 1920s and 1930s, Cummings returned to Paris a number of times, and traveled throughout Europe, meeting, among others, artist [[Pablo Picasso]]. In 1931 Cummings traveled to the [[Soviet Union]], recounting his experiences in ''[[Eimi (book)|Eimi]]'', published two years later. During these years Cummings also traveled to Northern Africa and [[Mexico]]. He worked as an essayist and portrait artist for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine (1924–1927).

In 1926, Cummings' parents were in a car crash; only his mother survived, although she was severely injured. Cummings later described the crash in the following passage from his ''i: six nonlectures'' series given at Harvard (as part of the [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures]]) in 1952 and 1953:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A locomotive cut the car in half, killing my father instantly. When two brakemen jumped from the halted train, they saw a woman standing – dazed but erect – beside a mangled machine; with blood spouting (as the older said to me) out of her head. One of her hands (the younger added) kept feeling her dress, as if trying to discover why it was wet. These men took my sixty-six-year old mother by the arms and tried to lead her toward a nearby farmhouse; but she threw them off, strode straight to my father's body, and directed a group of scared spectators to cover him. When this had been done (and only then) she let them lead her away.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His father's death had a profound effect on Cummings, who entered a new period in his artistic life. He began to focus on more important aspects of life in his poetry. He started this new period by paying homage to his father in the poem "my father moved through dooms of love".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~richie/poetry/html/aupoem114.html |title=My father moved through dooms of love |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050315070117/http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~richie/poetry/html/aupoem114.html |archivedate=March 15, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Gary | last = Lane | authorlink =  | year = 1976 | title = I Am: A Study of E.

In 1952, his alma mater, [[Harvard University]], awarded Cummings an honorary seat as a guest professor. The [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures]] he gave in 1952 and 1955 were later collected as ''i: six nonlectures''.

Cummings spent the last decade of his life traveling, fulfilling speaking engagements, and spending time at his summer home, [[Joy Farm]], in [[Silver Lake, New Hampshire]]. He died of a stroke on September 3, 1962, at the age of 67 in [[North Conway, New Hampshire]] at the Memorial Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1962/09/04/archives/ee-cummings-dies-of-stroke-poet-stood-for-stylistic-liberty-unusual.html|url-access=subscription|title=E.&amp;nbsp;E.

==Personal life==

===Marriages===
[[File:EECummings pd4.jpg|thumb|upright|Sketched self-portrait circa 1920]]
Cummings was married briefly twice, first to Elaine Orr, then to Anne Minnerly Barton. His longest relationship lasted more than three decades, a common-law marriage to Marion Morehouse.

Cummings' first marriage, to Elaine Orr, began as a love affair in 1918 while she was still married to [[Scofield Thayer]], one of Cummings' friends from Harvard. During this time he wrote a good deal of his erotic poetry.&lt;ref name="Kennedy"&gt;''Selected Poems,'' Ed. Richard S. Kennedy, Liveright, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; After divorcing Thayer, Elaine married Cummings on March 19, 1924. The couple had a daughter together out of wedlock. However, the couple separated after two months of marriage and divorced less than nine months later.

Cummings married his second wife Anne Minnerly Barton on May 1, 1929, and they separated three years later in 1932. That same year, Anne obtained a [[Mexican divorce]]; it was not officially recognized in the United States until August 1934. Anne died in 1970 aged 72.

In 1934, after his separation from his second wife, Cummings met Marion Morehouse, a fashion model and photographer. Although it is not clear whether the two were ever formally married, Morehouse lived with Cummings in a [[common-law marriage]] until his death in 1962. She died on May 18, 1969,&lt;ref&gt;''Marion Morehouse Cummings, Poet's Widow, Top Model, Dies'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 19, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; while living at 4 [[Patchin Place]], [[Greenwich Village]], New York City, where Cummings had resided since September 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer-Lauçanno, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political views===
According to his testimony in ''[[Eimi (book)|EIMI]]'', Cummings had little interest in politics until his trip to the Soviet Union in 1931,&lt;ref name=Blumenkranz&gt;Carla Blumenkranz, [http://www.poetryfoundation.org/article/180437 "The Enormous Poem: When E.E. Cummings Repunctuated Stalinism."] Poetry Foundation. www.poetryfoundation.org/&lt;/ref&gt; after which he shifted rightward on many political and social issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://college.cengage.com/english/lauter/heath/4e/students/author_pages/modern/cummings_ee.html|title=Heath Anthology of American Literature E.E. cummings – Author Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his radical and [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] public image, he was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], and later, an ardent supporter of [[Joseph McCarthy]].&lt;ref&gt;Wetzsteon, Ross. 'Republic of Dreams: Greenwich Village: The American Bohemia, 1910–1960', pp. 449 [https://books.google.com/books?id=o2DB77ccf9sC&amp;pg=PA449 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

===Poetry===
Despite Cummings' familiarity with [[avant-garde]] styles (likely affected by the ''[[Calligrammes]]'' of French poet [[Apollinaire]], according to a contemporary observation&lt;ref&gt;Taupin, Rene, ''The Influence of French Symbolism on Modern American Poetry 1927'' (Trans. William Pratt), AMS Inc, New York 1985  {{ISBN|0404615791}}&lt;/ref&gt;), much of his work is quite traditional. Many of his poems are [[sonnet]]s, albeit often with a modern twist. He occasionally used the [[blues#Lyrics|blues]] form and [[acrostics]]. Cummings' poetry often deals with themes of love and nature, as well as the relationship of the individual to the masses and to the world. His poems are also often rife with satire.

While his poetic forms and themes share an affinity with the [[Romanticism|Romantic tradition]], Cummings' work universally shows a particular idiosyncrasy of [[syntax]], or way of arranging individual words into larger phrases and sentences. Many of his most striking poems do not involve any typographical or punctuation innovations at all, but purely syntactic ones.

&lt;!---NB **The typography is Cummings' original setting**---&gt;

As well as being influenced by notable [[Modernist literature|modernists]], including [[Gertrude Stein]] and [[Ezra Pound]], Cummings in his early work drew upon the [[Imagism|imagist]] experiments of [[Amy Lowell]]. Later, his visits to Paris exposed him to [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]], which he reflected in his work. He began to rely on symbolism and allegory, where he once had used simile and metaphor. In his later work, he rarely used comparisons that required objects that were not previously mentioned in the poem, choosing to use a symbol instead. Due to this, his later poetry is "frequently more lucid, more moving, and more profound than his earlier."&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Norman. ''E. E. Cummings the Art of His Poetry.'' Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 1967. p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Cummings also liked to incorporate imagery of nature and death into much of his poetry.

While some of his poetry is [[free verse]] (with no concern for [[rhyme]] or [[meter (poetry)|meter]]), many have a recognizable sonnet structure of 14 lines, with an intricate rhyme scheme. A number of his poems feature a typographically exuberant style, with words, parts of words, or punctuation symbols scattered across the page, often making little sense until read aloud, at which point the meaning and emotion become clear. Cummings, who was also a painter, understood the importance of presentation, and used typography to "paint a picture" with some of his poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Iain | last = Landles | authorlink = Iain Landles | year = 2001 | title = An Analysis of Two Poems by E. E. Cummings | journal=SPRING, the Journal of the E. E. Cummings Society | volume = 10 | pages = 31–43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seeds of Cummings' unconventional style appear well established even in his earliest work. At age six, he wrote to his father:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;FATHER DEAR. BE, YOUR FATHER-GOOD AND GOOD,&lt;br&gt;
HE IS GOOD NOW, IT IS NOT GOOD TO SEE IT RAIN,&lt;br&gt;
FATHER DEAR IS, IT, DEAR, NO FATHER DEAR,&lt;br&gt;
LOVE, YOU DEAR,&lt;br&gt;
ESTLIN.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Selected letters of E. E. Cummings'', (1972) Edward Estlin Cummings, Frederick Wilcox Dupee, George Stade. University of Michigan p. 3 {{ISBN|978-0-233-95637-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following his autobiographical novel, ''[[The Enormous Room]]'', Cummings' first published work was a collection of poems titled ''[[Tulips and Chimneys]]'' (1923). This work was the public's first encounter with his characteristic eccentric use of grammar and punctuation.

Some of Cummings' most famous poems do not involve much, if any, odd typography or punctuation, but still carry his unmistakable style, particularly in unusual and impressionistic word order.

{{Quote box |width=300px |align=right ||salign=right

Cummings' work often does not proceed in accordance with the conventional combinatorial rules that generate typical English sentences (for example, "they sowed their isn't"). In addition, a number of Cummings' poems feature, in part or in whole, intentional misspellings, and several incorporate phonetic spellings intended to represent particular dialects. Cummings also made use of inventive formations of compound words, as in "in Just"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/images/modeng/public/Cum2Dia/CumDi580.jpg |title=in Just}}&lt;/ref&gt; which features words such as "mud-luscious", "puddle-wonderful", and "eddieandbill." This poem is part of a sequence of poems titled ''Chansons Innocentes'';&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15398 |title=''Chansons Innocentes'' |access-date=October 10, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227115128/http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15398 |archive-date=December 27, 2005 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; it has many references comparing the "balloonman" to [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], the mythical creature that is half-goat and half-man. Literary critic [[R.P. Blackmur]] has commented that this use of language is "frequently unintelligible because [Cummings] disregards the historical accumulation of meaning in words in favour of merely private and personal associations."&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Norman. ''E. E. Cummings the Art of His Poetry''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1967. pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Cummings' poems are satirical and address social issues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15404 |title="why must itself up every of a park" |access-date=October 10, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813233241/http://poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15404 |archive-date=August 13, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but have an equal or even stronger bias toward romanticism: time and again his poems celebrate love, sex, and the season of rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15403 |title="anyone lived in a pretty how town" |access-date=October 10, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726121247/http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15403 |archive-date=July 26, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cummings also wrote children's books and novels. A notable example of his versatility is an introduction he wrote for a collection of the comic strip ''[[Krazy Kat]]''.

===Controversy===
Cummings is known for controversial subject matter, as he wrote numerous erotic poems. He also sometimes included ethnic slurs in his writing. For instance, in his 1950 collection ''Xaipe: Seventy-One Poems'', Cummings published two poems containing words that caused outrage in some quarters.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Norman, and Harry Thornton Moore. ''E. E. Cummings the Growth of a Writer''. Carbondale: Southern Illinois UP, 1964. pp. 153–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;poem&gt;
:one day a nigger
:caught in his hand
:a little star no bigger
:than not to understand

:i'll never let you go
:until you've made me white"
:so she did and now
:stars shine at night.&lt;ref name="Cummings, 1950"&gt;Cummings, ''Xaipe, Seventy-one Poems''. New York: Oxford UP, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

and

&lt;poem&gt;
:a kike is the most dangerous
:machine as yet invented

:ity(out of a jew a few
:dead dollars and some twisted laws)
:it comes both prigged and canted&lt;ref name="Cummings, 1950"/&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

Cummings biographer Catherine Reef notes of the controversy:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Friends begged Cummings to reconsider publishing these poems, and the book's editor pleaded with him to withdraw them, but he insisted that they stay. All the fuss perplexed him. The poems were commenting on prejudice, he pointed out, and not condoning it. He intended to show how derogatory words cause people to see others in terms of stereotypes rather than as individuals. "America (which turns Hungarian into 'hunky' &amp; Irishman into 'mick' and Norwegian into 'square- head') is to blame for 'kike,'" he said.&lt;ref Name="Reef"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[William Carlos Williams]] spoke out in his defense.&lt;ref Name="Reef"&gt;''E. Cummings'' (2006) by Catherine Reef, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt p. 115 {{ISBN|978-0-618-56849-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarification needed|reason=|date=April 2018}}

===Plays===
During his lifetime, Cummings published four plays. ''HIM'', a three-act play, was first produced in 1928 by the [[Provincetown Players]] in New York City. The production was directed by James Light. The play's main characters are "Him", a playwright, portrayed by [[William Johnstone (actor)|William Johnstone]], and "Me", his girlfriend, portrayed by [[Erin O'Brien-Moore]].

Cummings said of the unorthodox play:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Relax and give the play a chance to strut its stuff—relax, stop wondering what it is all 'about'—like many strange and familiar things, Life included, this play isn't 'about,' it simply is. . . . Don't try to enjoy it, let it try to enjoy you. &lt;small&gt;DON'T TRY TO UNDERSTAND IT, LET IT TRY TO UNDERSTAND YOU.&lt;/small&gt;"&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Anthropos, or the Future of Art'' is a short, one-act play that Cummings contributed to the anthology ''Whither, Whither or After Sex, What? A Symposium to End Symposium''. The play consists of dialogue between Man, the main character, and three "infrahumans", or inferior beings. The word ''[[Greek language|anthropos]]'' is the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for "man", in the sense of "mankind".

''Tom, A Ballet'' is a ballet based on ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''. The ballet is detailed in a "synopsis" as well as descriptions of four "episodes", which were published by Cummings in 1935. It has never been performed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gvsu.edu/english/cummings/Tom.html GVSU.edu The E. E. Cummings Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050423191607/http://www.gvsu.edu/english/cummings/Tom.html |date=April 23, 2005 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Santa Claus: A Morality]]'' was probably Cummings' most successful play. It is an allegorical Christmas fantasy presented in one act of five scenes. The play was inspired by his daughter Nancy, with whom he was reunited in 1946. It was first published in the Harvard College magazine, ''Wake''. The play's main characters are Santa Claus, his family (Woman and Child), Death, and Mob. At the outset of the play, Santa Claus' family has disintegrated due to their lust for knowledge (Science). After a series of events, however, Santa Claus' faith in love and his rejection of the materialism and disappointment he associates with Science are reaffirmed, and he is reunited with Woman and Child.

===Name and capitalization===
Cummings' publishers and others have often echoed the unconventional [[orthography]] in his poetry by writing his name in lowercase and without periods ([[full stop]]s), but normal orthography for his name (uppercase and periods) is supported by scholarship and preferred by publishers today.&lt;ref name="friedman92" /&gt; Cummings himself used both the lowercase and capitalized versions, though he most often signed his name with capitals.&lt;ref name="friedman92"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Friedman | first =  Norman | year = 1992 | title = Not "e. e. cummings" | journal=Spring | volume = 1 | pages = 114–21 | url = http://faculty.gvsu.edu/websterm/cummings/caps.htm | accessdate = December 13, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of lowercase for his initials was popularized in part by the title of some books, particularly in the 1960s, printing his name in lower case on the cover and spine. In the preface to ''E. E. Cummings: The Growth of a Writer'' by Norman Friedman, critic Harry T. Moore notes Cummings "had his name put legally into lower case, and in his later books the titles and his name were always in lower case."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Friedman | first = Norman | title = E. E. Cummings: The Growth of a Writer | location = Carbondale | publisher=Southern Illinois University Press | year = 1964 | isbn = 0-8093-0978-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cummings' widow, however, this is incorrect.&lt;ref name="friedman92" /&gt; She wrote to Friedman: "You should not have allowed H. Moore to make such a stupid &amp; childish statement about Cummings &amp; his signature." On February 27, 1951, Cummings wrote to his French translator D. Jon Grossman that he preferred the use of upper case for the particular edition they were working on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Friedman | first = Norman | year = 1995 | title = Not "e. e. cummings" Revisited | journal=Spring | volume = 5 | pages = 41–43 | url = http://faculty.gvsu.edu/websterm/cummings/caps2.html | accessdate = May 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One Cummings scholar believes that on the rare occasions that Cummings signed his name in all lowercase, he may have intended it as a gesture of humility, not as an indication that it was the preferred orthography for others to use.&lt;ref name="friedman92" /&gt; Additionally, the ''Chicago Manual of Style'', which prescribes favoring non-standard capitalizion of names in accordance with the bearer's strongly stated preference, notes "E. E. Cummings can be safely capitalized; it was one of his publishers, not he himself, who lowercased his name."&lt;ref name="chicago84"&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Chicago University Press|year=2010|title=Chicago Manual of Style|edition=16|section=Captalization of Personal Names|page=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
In 1943, modern dancer and choreographer [[Jean Erdman]] presented "The Transformations of Medusa, Forever and Sunsmell" with a commissioned score by [[John Cage]] and a spoken text from the title poem by E. E. Cummings, sponsored by the [[Arts Club of Chicago]]. Erdman also choreographed "Twenty Poems" (1960), a cycle of E. E. Cummings' poems for eight dancers and one actor, with a commissioned score by [[Teiji Ito]]. It was performed in the round at the [[Circle in the Square Theatre]] in Greenwich Village.

Numerous composers have set Cummings' poems to music:
* In 1961, [[Pierre Boulez]] composed "Cummings ist der dichter" from poems by E.E. Cummings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brahms.ircam.fr/works/work/6957/|title=cummings ist der dichter, Pierre Boulez}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Aribert Reimann]] set Cummings to music in "Impression IV" (1961) for soprano and piano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2743128|title=Impression IV : nach einem Gedicht von E.E.

* [[Morton Feldman]] (1926-1987) in 1951 composed "4 Songs to e.e. cummings" for soprano, piano and cello, using material from Cummings' "50 poems" of 1940: "!Blac", "Air", "(Sitting In A Tree-)" and "(Moan)".
* The Icelandic singer [[Björk]] used lines from Cummings's poem "I Will Wade Out" for the lyrics of "Sun in My Mouth" on her 2001 album ''[[Vespertine]].'' On her next album, ''[[Medúlla]]'' (2004), Björk used his poem "It May Not Always Be So" as the lyrics for the song "Sonnets/Unrealities XI."
* The American composer [[Eric Whitacre]] wrote a [[Eric Whitacre#SATB choral|cycle of works]] for choir titled ''The City and the Sea'', which consists of five poems by Cummings set to music.
* Others who have composed settings for his poems include [[Dominic Argento]], [[William Bergsma]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Marc Blitzstein]], [[John Cage]], [[Romeo Cascarino]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Serge de Gastyne]], [[David Diamond (composer)|David Diamond]], [[John Woods Duke|John Duke]], [[Margaret Garwood]], [[Daron Hagen]], [[Michael Hedges]], [[Richard Hundley]], [[Barbara Kolb]], [[Leonard Lehrman]], [[Robert Manno]], [[Salvatore Martirano]], [[William Mayer (composer)|William Mayer]], [[John Musto]], [[Paul Nordoff]], [[Tobias Picker]], [[Vincent Persichetti]], [[Ned Rorem]], [[Peter Schickele]], [[Elie Siegmeister]], [[Aki Takase]], [[Hugo Weisgall]], [[Dan Welcher]], and [[James Yannatos]], among many others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lieder.net/lieder/c/cummings/ "E.E.

'''Elaine''' is a name shared by several different female characters in [[Arthurian legend]].

==Elaine of Astolat==
{{Main|Elaine of Astolat}}

Elaine of [[Astolat]], also known in some texts as Elaine the Fair or the Fair Maid of Astolat and (as ''[[The Lady of Shalott]]'' in [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Lord Alfred Tennyson]]'s same-titled poem) is a maiden who falls in unrequited love with Sir [[Lancelot]].

==Elaine of Benoic==
Elaine of Benoic (or Benwick) is the wife of [[King Ban]] and the mother of [[Lancelot]]. She is the sister of [[Evaine]], wife of King Bors of Gaunnes and mother of [[Sir Lionel]] and Sir [[Bors]]. Her husband dies of grief when his enemy [[Claudas]] attacks his city, and Elaine goes to attend to him. She sets the infant Lancelot down, and he is taken by the [[Lady of the Lake]], who raises him. Elaine sees her son for the first time in years just before she dies.

==Elaine of Corbenic==
{{main|Elaine of Corbenic}}

Elaine of [[Corbenic]] (also known as Amite, Heliaebel, Helaine, Perevida or Helizabel; identified as "The Grail Maiden" or "Grail Bearer") is the daughter of [[Fisher King|King Pelles]] and the mother of Sir [[Galahad]] by Sir [[Lancelot]]. She first appears in the Prose Lancelot (the [[Vulgate Cycle]]), but fully emerges as a character in Sir [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte D'Arthur]]''. Her first significant action is showing the [[Holy Grail]] to Sir Lancelot.

==Elaine of Garlot==
Elaine of Garlot is the daughter of [[Gorlois]], [[List of legendary rulers of Cornwall|Duke of Cornwall]], and [[Igraine]]. She is a sister of [[Morgan le Fay]] and [[Morgause]] and a half-sister of [[King Arthur]]. She marries King [[Nentres of Garlot]] and has a son named [[Galeschin]], who becomes a [[Knight of the Round Table]], and a daughter named Elaine the Younger. 

Considering the actions of her sisters, she is remarkable in that she is otherwise unremarkable. It is assumed she stayed in her own lands and did little to help or hinder any of her siblings.

==Elaine of Listenoise==
Elaine of Listenoise is the daughter of King [[Pellinore]]. She kills herself after the death of her lover Sir Miles of the Laundes. 

Some modern authors, such as [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]] in ''[[The Mists of Avalon]]'', combine or conflate her with Elaine of Corbenic, due to their shared name and the similarity of their fathers' names.

==Elaine the Peerless==
Elaine the Peerless is the niece of the Lord of the Fens and wife of Persides the Red of the Castle of Gazevilte.

==Elaine the Younger==
Elaine the Younger is the daughter of Elaine of Garlot and (usually) [[King Nentres]], and a niece of [[King Arthur]]. In some versions of the legend, she falls in love with Sir [[Percival]]. Other versions cast her as a child of [[King Lot]].

'''Ethel Wood''' (16 January 1901 – 19 August 2011) was a [[Guernsey]] [[supercentenarian]]. At the age of 110, Wood was the ninth-oldest verified person who died in the United Kingdom following the death of 112-year-old [[Margaret Fish]] on 12 March 2011. Wood was not born in the United Kingdom, since Guernsey is a [[Crown dependencies|crown-dependency]], and legally never part of the Kingdom of England or the the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmjust/56/5604.htm |title=Crown Dependencies – Justice Committee |website=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] |date=30 March 2010 |accessdate=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
.

==Biography==

Ethel Wood was born in [[Saint Sampson, Guernsey]]. She was one of five children born to William and Lily Wood. Wood trained as a teacher in London prior to the [[German occupation of the Channel Islands|German occupation of Guernsey]]. Like her siblings, she never married or had children.

She moved to Essex in the 1990s to care for her younger sister, Edith. Wood lived in her own home until breaking her leg during a fall a month before her 110th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/local/clacton/8797400.Ethel__aged_110__says___I_don_t_feel_any_different_/ "Ethel, aged 110, says: "I don't feel any different""], ''Daily Gazette'' ([[Clacton-on-Sea|Clacton]], Frinton and Walton), 18 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eadt.co.uk/news/essex-amazing-ethel-celebrates-her-110th-birthday-1-776944|title=Essex: ‘Amazing’ Ethel celebrates her 110th birthday|first=By Chris|last=Harris|publisher=|accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethel died suddenly on 19 August 2011, aged 110 years, 215 days in England. If she had lived until December of that year, she would have surpassed the only other supercententenarian from Guernsey, [[Margaret Ann Neve]] (1792–1903).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3154">'''Generación del 51''' is a designation for one of a series of "generations" of Spanish composers, identifying a group born between 1924 and 1938.

Members of this group of composers from the Basque and Castilian-speaking regions of Spain include {{harv|Perez Castillo|2001}}:
*[[Carmelo Bernaola|Carmelo Alonso Bernaola]] (1929–2002)
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Miguel Alonso (composer)|es|3=Miguel Alonso Gómez|lt=Miguel Alonso}} (1925–2002)
*[[Angel Arteaga]]
*[[Cristóbal Halffter]] (b. 1930)
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Ramón Barce|es}} (1928–2008)
*[[Agustín Bertomeu]] (b. 1929)
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Amando Blanquer|es|3=Amando Blanquer Ponsoda}} (1935–2005)
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Francisco Calés|es|3=Francisco Calés Otero}} (1925–1985)
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Manuel Castillo|es}} (1930–2005)
*[[Juan José Falcón Sanabria]] (b. 1936)
*[[Antón García Abril]] (b. 1933)
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Agustín González Acilu|es}} (b. 1929)
*[[Juan Hidalgo Codorniu|Juan Hidalgo]] (b. 1927)
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Ángel Oliver|es|3=Ángel Oliver Pina}} (1937–2005)
*[[Luis de Pablo]] (b. 1930)
*[[Claudio Prieto]] (b. 1934)
In their earlier works, members of this generation tended toward the avant-garde, with post-Webernian [[serialism]] evident in the work of Halffter and Luis de Pablo in particular. By the end of the 1970s a mellowing of their language becomes apparent, and during the 1980s many of them began to turn to [[tonality]] of one sort or another {{harv|Perez Castillo|2001}}. 

The Catalan members of this generation are associated with the reforming and renewing tendencies that emerged after the post-Civil War isolation ({{harvnb|Gómez|2001}}; {{harvnb|Perez Castillo|2001}}):
* {{Interlanguage link multi|Xavier Benguerel i Godó|ca}} (b. 1931)
* {{Interlanguage link multi|Joan Guinjoan Gispert|ca}} (b. 1931)
* [[Josep Mestres Quadreny]] (b. 1929)
* [[Josep Soler i Sardà]] (b. 1935)
Soler's compositional palette involves serial techniques, and he is particularly noted for his dramatic music {{harv|Perez Castillo|2001}}.

Terms '''human–animal hybrid''' and '''animal–human hybrid''' refer to an entity that incorporates elements from both humans and non-human animals.&lt;ref name=arts/&gt;&lt;ref name=Columbus&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Alan|date=November 15, 2012|title=Human-animal mix might become illegal|publisher=''[[The Columbus Dispatch]]''|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/national_world/2012/11/15/human-animal-mix-might-become-illegal.html|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fone/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mott/&gt;&lt;ref name=wet/&gt;

==Description==
For thousands of years, these [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] have been one of the most common themes in [[storytelling]] about animals throughout the world. The lack of a strong divide between humanity and animal nature in multiple traditional and ancient cultures has provided the underlying historical context for the popularity of tales where humans and animals have mingling relationships, such as in which one turns into the other or in which some mixed being goes through a journey.&lt;ref name=Margo/&gt; [[Interspecies friendships]] within the animal kingdom, as well as between humans and their pets, additionally provides an underlying root for the popularity of such beings.&lt;ref name=arts/&gt;

In various mythologies throughout history, many particularly famous hybrids have existed, including as a part of Egyptian and Indian spirituality.&lt;ref name=Margo/&gt; The entities have also been characters in fictional media more recently in history such as in [[H. G. Wells]]' work ''[[The Island of Doctor Moreau]]'', adapted into the popular [[1932 in film|1932 film]] ''[[Island of Lost Souls (1932 film)|Island of Lost Souls]]''.&lt;ref name=fone/&gt; In legendary terms, the hybrids have played varying roles from that of trickster and/or villain to serving as divine heroes in very different contexts, depending on the given culture.&lt;ref name=Margo/&gt;

For example, [[Pan (god)|Pan]] is a deity in [[Greek mythology]] that rules over and symbolizes the untamed wild, being worshiped by hunters, fishermen, and shepherds in particular. The mischievous yet cheerful character is a [[Satyr]] who has the hindquarters, legs, and horns of a goat while otherwise being essentially human in appearance, with stories of his encounters with different gods, humans, and others being retold for centuries on after the days of early Greece by groups such as the [[Delphian Society]].&lt;ref name=delphian&gt;{{cite book|title=Hebrew literature. Greek mythology, life and art|pages=169–171|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WKIOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=%22pan,+oh,+great+god+Pan%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22pan%2C%20oh%2C%20great%20god%20Pan%22&amp;f=false|publisher=[[Delphian Society]]|date=1913|editor=Rev. J.K. Brennan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the human-animal hybrid has appeared in acclaimed works of art by figures such as [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]].&lt;ref name=wet&gt;{{cite book|pages=12.3|title=Wetwares: Experiments in Postvital Living|first=Richard|last=Doyle|url=https://books.google.com/?id=A0FPKNU7mrUC&amp;pg=PT26&amp;dq=%22just+you+watch!%22+pan#v=onepage&amp;q=%22just%20you%20watch!%22%20pan&amp;f=false|date=2003|publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]]|isbn=9781452905846}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional famous mythological hybrids include the Egyptian [[Psychopomp|god of death]], named [[Anubis]], and the fox-like Japanese beings that are called [[Kitsune]].&lt;ref name=Margo/&gt;

When looked at scientifically, outside of a fictional and/or mythical context, the real-life creation of human-animal hybrids has served as a subject of legal, moral, and technological debate in the context of recent advances in [[genetic engineering]].&lt;ref name=Columbus/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mott/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; Defined by the magazine ''[[Humanity+#H.2B Magazine|H+]]'' as "genetic alterations that are blendings [sic] of animal and human forms", such hybrids may be referred by other names occasionally such as "para-humans".&lt;ref name=arts&gt;{{cite web|title=Arts: The Parahuman Sculpture of Patricia Piccinini, Posthumanity and What It Really Means to be Human|publisher=''[[Humanity+#H.2B Magazine|H+]]''|date=October 11, 2013|accessdate=August 6, 2015|url=http://hplusmagazine.com/2013/10/11/arts-the-parahuman-sculpture-of-patricia-piccinini-posthumanity-and-what-it-really-means-to-be-human/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Columbus/&gt; They may additionally may be called "humanized animals".&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; Technically speaking, they are also related to "cybrids" ([[cytoplasmic hybrids]]), with "cybrid" cells featuring foreign human [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] inside of them being a topic of interest. Possibly, a real-world human-animal hybrid may be an entity formed from either a [[Egg cell|human egg]] fertilized by a nonhuman [[sperm]] or a nonhuman egg fertilized by a human sperm.&lt;ref name=Columbus/&gt; While at first being a concept in the likes of legends and [[thought experiment]]s, the first stable human-animal [[Chimera (genetics)|chimera]]s (not hybrids but related) to actually exist were first created by [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine|Shanghai Second Medical University]] scientists in 2003, the result of having fused human cells with rabbit eggs.&lt;ref name=Mott&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/01/0125_050125_chimeras.html|first=Mott|last=Maryann|date=January 25, 2005|title=Animal-Human Hybrids Spark Controversy|publisher=''[[National Geographic News]]''|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, a [[U.S. Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. patent]] has notably been granted for a mouse chimera with a human [[immune system]].&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt;

In terms of [[Bioethics|scientific ethics]], restrictions on the creation of human–animal hybrids have proved a controversial matter in multiple countries. While the state of [[Arizona]] banned the practice altogether in 2010, a proposal on the subject that sparked some interest in the [[United States Senate]] from 2011 to 2012 ended up going nowhere. Although the two concepts are not strictly related, discussions of experimentation into blended human and animal creatures has paralleled the discussions around [[Embryonic stem cell|embryonic stem-cell research]] (the '[[stem cell controversy]]').&lt;ref name=Columbus/&gt; The creation of [[genetically modified organism]]s for a multitude of purposes has taken place in the modern world for decades, examples being specifically designed foodstuffs made to have features such as higher crop yields through better disease resistance.&lt;ref name=foods&gt;{{cite news|last=Young|first=Caroline|date=February 2, 2014|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/builtlean/diet-and-nutrition_b_4323937.html|title=7 Most Common Genetically Modified Foods|publisher=''[[The Huffington Post]]''|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the legal and moral controversy over the possible real-life making of such beings,&lt;ref name=Columbus/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mott/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; then President [[George W.

==Legendary historical and mythological human-animal hybrids==

Beings displaying a mixture of human and animal traits while also having a similarly blended appearance have played a vast and varied role in multiple traditions around the world.&lt;ref name=Margo/&gt; Artist and scholar [[Pietro Gaietto]] has written that "representations of human-animal hybrids always have their origins in religion". In "successive traditions they may change in meaning but they still remain within spiritual culture", Gaietto has argued, when looking back in an [[evolution]]-minded point of view. The beings show up in both [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]], with various elements of [[ancient Egyptian]] society ebbing and flowing into those cultures in particular. Prominent examples in [[ancient Egyptian religion]], featuring some of the earliest such hybrid beings, include the [[Canidae|canine]]-like [[Psychopomp|god of death]] known as [[Anubis]] and the lion-like [[Sphinx]].&lt;ref name=beauty&gt;{{cite book|pages=190–192|title=Phylogensesis of Beauty|author=[[Pietro Gaietto]]|isbn=9781291842951|publisher=Lulu Press Inc|date=2014|url=https://books.google.com/?id=u8uwBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA191&amp;dq=Pietro+Gaietto+human-animal#v=onepage&amp;q=Pietro%20Gaietto%20human-animal&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=Self-published book|date=July 2018}} Other instances of these types of characters include figures within both [[Chinese mythology|Chinese]] and [[Japanese mythology]].&lt;ref name=Margo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mair/&gt; The observation of [[interspecies friendships]] within the animal kingdom, as well as the bonds existing between humans and their pets, have been a source of the appeal in such stories.&lt;ref name=arts/&gt;

A prominent hybrid figure that's internationally known is the [[Greek mythology|mythological Greek]] figure of Pan. A deity that rules over and symbolizes the untamed wild, he helps express the inherent beauty of the natural world as the Greeks saw things. He specifically received reverence by ancient [[hunter]]s, fishermen, shepherds, and other groups with a close connection to nature. Pan is a Satyr who possesses the hindquarters, legs, and horns of a goat while otherwise being essentially human in appearance; stories of his encounters with different gods, humans, and others have been [[Pan in popular culture|a part of popular culture]] in several different cultures for many years.&lt;ref name=delphian/&gt; The human-animal hybrid has appeared in acclaimed works of art by figures such as [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]],&lt;ref name=wet/&gt; also being mentioned in [[Poetry|poetic pieces]] such as in [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher's]] writings.&lt;ref name=delphian/&gt;

In [[Chinese mythology]], the figure of [[Zhu Bajie|Chu Pa-chieh]] undergoes a personal journey in which he gives up wickedness for virtue. After causing a disturbance in heaven from his licentious actions, he is exiled to Earth. By mistake, he enters the womb of a sow and ends up being born as a half-man/half-pig entity. With the head and ears of a pig coupled with a human body, his already animal-like sense of selfishness from his past life remains. [[Matricide|Killing and eating his mother]] as well as [[Fratricide|devouring his brothers]], he makes his way to a mountain hideout, spending his days preying on unwary travelers unlucky enough to cross his path. However, the exhortations of the kind [[goddess]] [[Guanyin|Kuan Yin]], journeying in China, persuade him to seek a nobler path, and his life's journey and the side of goodness proceeds on such that he even is ordained a priest by the goddess herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[E.T.C.

[[File:Tanuki-statues.jpg|thumb|This image depicts a set of [[Japanese raccoon dog|Tanuki]] statues on the side of a Japanese road.]]

Several hybrid entities have long played a major role in Japanese media and in traditional beliefs within the country. For example, a warrior god known as Amida received worship as a part of [[Japanese mythology]] for many years; he possessed a generally humanoid appearance while having a canine-like head. However, the god's devotional popularity fell in about the middle of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=beauty/&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=Self-published book|date=July 2018}} A [[Japanese raccoon dog|Tanuki]] resembles a [[raccoon]] or [[badger]], but its [[shape-shifting]] talents allow it to turn into humans for the purposes of trickery, such as impersonating [[Buddhist]] [[monk]]s.

Other examples include characters in ancient [[Anatolia]] and [[Mesopotamia]].

Many prominent pieces of children's literature over the past two centuries have featured humanized animal characters, often as [[protagonists]] in the stories. In the opinion of popular educator [[Lucy Sprague Mitchell]], the appeal of such mythical and fantastic beings comes from how children desire "direct" language "told in terms of images— visual, auditory, tactile, muscle images". Another author has remarked that an "animal costume" provides "a way to emphasize or even exaggerate a particular characteristic". The [[anthropomorphic]] characters in the seminal works by English writer [[Beatrix Potter]] in particular live an ambiguous situation, having human dress yet displaying many instinctive animal traits. Writing on the popularity of [[Peter Rabbit]], a later author commented that in "balancing humanized domesticity against wild rabbit foraging, Potter subverted parental authority and its built in hypocrisy" in Potter's child-centered books. Writer Lisa Fraustino has cited on the subject [[R. M. Lockley|R.M. Lockley]]'s tongue-in-cheek observation: "Rabbits are so human. Or is it the other way around— humans are so rabbit?"&lt;ref name=rabbit&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethics and Children's Literature

Writer [[H. G. Wells]] created his famous work ''[[The Island of Doctor Moreau]]'', featuring a mixture of [[Horror literature|horror]] and [[Science fiction literature|science fiction]] elements, to promote the anti-[[vivisection]] cause as a part of his long-time advocacy for [[animal rights]]. Wells' story describes a man stuck on an island ruled over by the titular Dr. Moreau, a morally depraved scientist who has created several human-animal hybrids even by combining parts of other animals. The story has been adapted into film several times, with varying success.  The most acclaimed version is the 1932 [[black-and-white]] treatment called ''[[Island of Lost Souls (1932 film)|Island of Lost Souls]]''.&lt;ref name=fone&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.moviefone.com/2013/09/06/leonardo-dicaprio-island-of-dr-moreau/

Wells himself wrote that "this story was the response of an imaginative mind to the reminder that humanity is but animal rough-hewn to a reasonable shape and in perpetual internal conflict between instinct and injunction," with the scandals surrounding [[Oscar Wilde]] being the impetus for the English writer's treatment of themes such as ethics and psychology. Challenging the [[Victorian era]] viewpoints of its time, the [[1896 in literature|1896 work]] presents a complex situation in which enhancing animals into hybrids involves both terrifying violence and pain as well as appears essentially futile, given the power of raw instinct. A pessimistic view towards the ability of human civilization to live by [[Rule of law|law-abiding]], [[Morality|moral standards]] for long thus follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=187–212|title=Compassion: The Culture and Politics of an Emotion|editor=Lauren Gail Berlant|author=Neville Hoad|date=2004|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YnkJYokNO2sC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=%22response+of+an+imaginative+mind+to+the+reminder+that+humanity+is%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22response%20of%20an%20imaginative%20mind%20to%20the%20reminder%20that%20humanity%20is%22&amp;f=false|isbn=9780415970525|publisher=[[Psychology Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brundle experiences drastic mutations as a result that horrify him. Movie critic Gerardo Valero has written that the famous horror work, "released at the dawn of the [[AIDS epidemic]]", "was seen by many as a metaphor for the disease" while also playing on bodily fears about [[dismemberment]] and coming apart that human beings inherently share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Valero|first=Gerardo|date=January 13, 2014|title=David Cronenberg's "The Fly"|publisher=[[rogerebert.com]]|accessdate=August 6, 2015|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/far-flung-correspondents/the-fly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[H.P. Lovecraft]] inspired movie ''[[Dagon (film)|Dagon]]'', released in 2001, additionally features grotesque hybrid beings. In terms of [[comic book]]s, examples of fictional human-animal hybrids include the characters in [[Charles Burns (cartoonist)|Charles Burns]]' ''[[Black Hole (comics)|Black Hole]]'' series.

===Background and technological analyses===
{{see also|History of genetic engineering}}

[[File:Bluetomato.jpg|thumb|right|upright|These [[Blue tomato|blue-colored tomatoes]] are an example of a [[genetically modified food]].]]

Broadly speaking, a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] being has one cell line throughout its entire body and came originally from a mix of entities, with different species involved to make a new genetic combination. For instance, a [[liger]] has a lion father and a [[tigress]] mother, such a creature only existing in [[Captivity (animal)|captivity]]. Such hybridization has frequently caused difficult health problems that caregivers for the captive animals struggle with.&lt;ref name=zonkey&gt;{{cite news|last=Palmer|first=Roxanne|date=July 25, 2013|title=Zonkey, Wholphin, Liger, Tigon: Fascinating Animal Hybrids|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/zonkey-wholphin-liger-tigon-fascinating-animal-hybrids-photos-1359907|publisher=''[[International Business Times]]''|accessdate=August 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[chimera (biology)|chimera]] is not the same thing as a hybrid because it is a being composed of two or more genetically distinct cell lines in one entity. The entity does not exist as a member of a separate species but has differing elements inside of it. An animal that has experienced an [[organ transplant]] or related surgery involving tissues from a different species is an example.&lt;ref name=Mott/&gt;

Throughout past [[human evolution]], hybridization occurred in many different instances, such as cross-breeding between [[Neanderthal]]s and ancient versions of what are now modern humans. Some scientists have believed that particular genes of the Neanderthal may have been key to ancient humans' adapting to the harsh [[climate]]s they faced [[Recent African origin of modern humans|when they left Africa]]. However, mixing between species in the wild both now and through natural history have generally resulted in [[Infertility|sterile offspring]], thus being a kind of dead end in reproductive terms.&lt;ref name=zonkey/&gt;

For much of modern history, the creation of [[genetically modified organism]]s in general was a topic rooted in fiction rather than practical research. This has changed significantly over the past few decades such that a number of plants and animals are commonly subject to [[genetic engineering]] for commercial purposes. For example, as of 2013 about 85% of the corn grown in the US as well as about 90% of its [[canola]] crops have been genetically modified.&lt;ref name=foods/&gt; As well, many Americans that have had cardiovascular surgery have had heart valves initially from pigs used in their procedures.&lt;ref name=Weiss&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A19781-2005Feb12.html|last=Weiss|first=Rick|date=February 13, 2005|title=U.S. Denies Patent for a Too-Human Hybrid|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|accessdate=August 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues relating to possible human-animal hybrids outside of a fictional, historical, or mythic context but as real, engineered beings received major international attention in 2003, after some Chinese scientists at the [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine|Shanghai Second Medical University]] managed to successfully fuse human cells with rabbit eggs. The embryos formed reportedly were the first stable human-animal chimeras in existence. Research in similar areas continued into 2004 and 2005, with the topic picking up coverage from publications such as ''[[National Geographic News]]''. The [[National Academy of Sciences]] soon began to look into the ethical questions involved.&lt;ref name=Mott/&gt; The [[U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] additionally stirred interest into the topic by granting a patent request for a genetically modified mouse with a human [[immune system]].&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; Scientists announced in 2017 that they successfully created the first human-animal chimeric embryo. The embryo consisted mostly pig cells and some human cells.  Scientists stated that they hope to use this technology to address the shortage of donor organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/01/human-pig-hybrid-embryo-chimera-organs-health-science/|title=Human-Pig Hybrid Created in the Lab—Here Are the Facts|date=2017-01-26|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal and moral discussions===
[[File:20080618 Bush Kempthorne oil exploration speech.jpg|thumb|right|[[POTUS|President]] [[George W.

{{see also|Bioethics|Regulation of genetic engineering}}

Advances in [[genetic engineering]] have generally caused a large amount of debates and discussion in the fields related to [[bioethics]], and research relating to the hypothetical creation of human-animal hybrids in the future has been no exception. The technical analyses of intermingling human-based and animal-based genetic material are ongoing; the ethical, moral, and legal issues arising from actual research using chimeras (rather than hybrids per se) at the moment also touch more speculative concerns as well. While laws against the creation of hybrid beings have been proposed in U.S. states and in the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]], several scientists have argued that legal barriers might go too far and prohibit medically beneficial studies into human modification.&lt;ref name=Columbus/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mott/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; Although the two topics are not strictly related, the debates involving the creation of human-animal hybrids have paralleled that of the debates around the stem-cell research controversy.&lt;ref name=Columbus/&gt;

The question of what line exists between a 'human' being and a 'non-human' being has been a difficult one for many researchers to answer. While animals having one percent or less of their cells originally coming from humans may clearly appear to be in the same boat as other animals, no consensus exists on how to think about beings in a genetic middle ground that have something like an even mix. "I don't think anyone knows in terms of crude percentages how to differentiate between humans and nonhumans," [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. patent office]] official John Doll has stated.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; Critics of increased government restrictions include scientists such as Dr. Douglas Kniss, head of the Laboratory of PeriNatal Research at [[Ohio State University]], who has remarked that formal laws aren't the best option since the "notion of animal–human hybrids is very complex." He's also argued that their creation is inherently "not the kind of thing we support" in his kind of research since scientists should "want to respect human life".&lt;ref name=Columbus/&gt; "There are chimeras out there that serve very valuable purposes in medical research, such as mice that make human antibodies," Michael Werner, the chief of policy for the [[Biotechnology Industry Organization]], has commented.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt;

In contrast, notable socio-economic theorist [[Jeremy Rifkin]] has expressed opposition to research that creates beings crossing species boundaries, arguing that it interferes with the fundamental 'right to exist' possessed by each animal species. "One doesn't have to be religious or into animal rights to think this doesn't make sense," he has argued when expressing support for anti-chimera and anti-hybrid legislation. As well, William Cheshire, associate professor of neurology at the [[Mayo Clinic]]'s Florida branch, has called the issue "unexplored biologic territory" and advocated for a "moral threshold of human neural development" to restrict the destroying a human embryo to obtain cell material and/or the creation of an organism that's partly human and partly animal." He has said, "We must be cautious not to violate the integrity of humanity or of animal life over which we have a stewardship responsibility".&lt;ref name=Mott/&gt;

In the U.S., efforts into creating a hybrid entity appeared to be legal when the topic first came up. The developmental biologist [[Stuart Newman]], a professor at [[New York Medical College]] in [[Valhalla, N.Y.]], applied for a patent on a human-animal chimera in 1997 as a challenge to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]], motivated by his moral and scientific opposition to the notion that living things can be patented at all. Prior legal precedent had established that genetically engineered entities in general could be patented, even if they were based on beings occurring in nature.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt;

After a seven-year process, Newman's patent finally received a flat rejection. The legal process had created a paper trail of arguments, giving Newman what he considered a victory. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' ran an article on the controversy that stated that it had raised "profound questions about the differences-- and similarities-- between humans and other animals, and the limits of treating animals as property."&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; President [[George W. Bush]] brought up the topic in his [[2006 State of the Union Address]], in which he called for the prohibition of "human cloning in all its forms", "creating or implanting embryos for experiments", "creating ''human-animal hybrids''", and also "buying, selling, or patenting human embryos". He argued, "A hopeful society has institutions of science and medicine that do not cut ethical corners and that recognize the matchless value of every life." He also stated that humanity "should never be discarded, devalued or put up for sale."&lt;ref name=Bush&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/31/AR2006013101468.html|title=President Bush's State of the Union Address – CQ Transcripts Wire|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|accessdate=August 8, 2015|date=January 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 appropriations bill passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Bush contained specific wording forbidding any patents on humans or human embryos.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; In terms of outright bans on hybrid research in the first place, a measure came up in the [[110th Congress]] entitled the ''Human-Animal Hybrid Prohibition Act of 2008''. Politician [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]], [[New Jersey's 4th congressional district|NJ-4]]) introduced it on April 24, 2008. The text of the proposed act stated that "human dignity and the integrity of the human species are compromised" if such hybrids exist and set up a punishment of imprisonment for up to ten years as well as a fine of over one million dollars. Though attracting support from many co-sponsors such as then [[United States House of Representatives|Representatives]] [[Mary Fallin]], [[Duncan Hunter]], [[Joseph R. Pitts]], and [[Rick Renzi]] among others, the Act failed to get through Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 5910 (110th): Human-Animal Hybrid Prohibition Act of 2008|publisher=[[GovTrack]]|accessdate=August 8, 2015|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/hr5910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related proposal had come up in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] the prior year, the ''Human–Animal Hybrid Prohibition Act of 2007'', and it also had failed. That effort was proposed by then Senator [[Sam Brownback]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]], [[Kansas|KS]]) on November 15, 2007. Featuring the same language as the later measure in the House, its bipartisan group of cosponsors included then Senators [[Tom Coburn]], [[Jim DeMint]], and [[Mary Landrieu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S. 2358 (110th): Human–Animal Hybrid Prohibition Act of 2007|publisher=[[GovTrack]]|accessdate=August 8, 2015|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/s2358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A localized measure designed to ban the creation of hybrid entities came up in the state of [[Arizona]] in 2010. The proposal was signed into law by then [[List of Governors of Arizona|Governor]] [[Jan Brewer]]. Its sponsor stated that it was needed to clarify important "ethical boundaries" in research.&lt;ref name=Columbus/&gt;

[[Image:Bride-groom-kiss.jpg|thumb|right|A newly [[wedding|wed]] husband kissing his bride]]
A '''husband''' is a [[male]] in a [[marriage|marital relationship]]. The rights and obligations of a husband regarding his [[spouse]] and others, and his status in the community and in law, vary between cultures and have varied over time.

In [[monogamy|monogamous]] cultures, there are only two parties to a marriage. This is enforced by legal codes that outlaw two ([[bigamy]]) or more ([[polygamy]]) female spouses. Similarly, [[polyandry]], marriage of one female partner with more than one male partner at the same time is not permitted. In polygamous and polyandrous cultures, there may be more than two parties to a marriage.

In marriages where both spouses are [[Man|men]], both may be referred to as husband.

In [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] marriages, the husband was traditionally regarded as the [[household|head of the household]] and was expected to be the sole provider or [[Breadwinner model|breadwinner]], a role that is still maintained in some cultures (sometimes described as [[paternalistic]]).

The term continues to be applied to such a man who has [[Legal separation|separated]] from his spouse and ceases to be applied to him only when his marriage has come to an end following a legally recognized [[divorce]] or the death of his spouse. On the death of his spouse, a husband is referred to as a [[widower]]; after a divorce a man may be referred to as the "ex-husband" of his former spouse.

In today's society a husband is not necessarily considered the [[Breadwinner model|breadwinner]] of the family,{{By whom|date=December 2017}} especially if his spouse has a more financially rewarding occupation or career.  In such cases, it is not uncommon for a husband to be considered a stay-at-home father if the married couple have children.

==Origin and etymology==
The term ''husband'' refers to [[Middle English]] ''huseband'', from [[Old English]] ''hūsbōnda'', from [[Old Norse]] ''hūsbōndi'' (''hūs'', "house" + ''bōndi'', ''būandi'', present participle of ''būa'', "to dwell", so, etymologically, "a householder").

==Related terms==
At the conclusion of a valid wedding, the marrying parties acquire the [[Social status|status]] of married person and, while the marriage persists, a man is called a husband.  In heterosexual marriages the woman is called a [[wife]]; in same-sex marriages between males, each male is called a husband; between females, each is called a wife. Regardless of gender, a married person is the spouse of the other party to the marriage.

Although "husband" is a close term to [[bridegroom|groom]], the latter is a male participant in a wedding ceremony, while a husband is a married man after the wedding and for the duration of the marriage. The term husband refers to the institutionalized role of the married male, while the term father refers to the male in context of his offspring, a state which may or may not indicate that a marriage ceremony has taken place.

In some cases of heterosexual marriage, before the marriage, he or his family may have received a [[dowry]], or have had to pay a [[bride price]], or both were exchanged. The dowry not only supported the establishment of a household, but also served as a condition that if the husband committed grave offenses upon his wife, he had to return the dowry to the wife or her family. For the time of the marriage, they were made inalienable by the husband.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica 2005, ''dowry''&lt;/ref&gt;  He might leave his wife (or wives), then widow (or widows), a dower (often a third or a half of his estate) to support her as [[dowager]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m-w.com/dictionary/dower|title=Dower - Definition of dower by Merriam-Webster|work=m-w.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Husband" further refers to the institutionalized form in relation to the spouse and offspring, unlike father, a term that puts a man into the context of his children. Also compare the similar [[husbandry]],&lt;ref&gt;See Wiktionary {{linktext|husbandry}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in the 14th century referred to the care of the household, but today means the "control or judicious use of resources", conservation, and in agriculture, the cultivation of plants and animals, and the science about its [[profession]].&lt;ref&gt;Merriam–Webster's Collegiate Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

As an external symbol of the fact that they are married, each spouse commonly wears a [[wedding ring]] on the ring finger; whether this is on the left or right hand depends on the country's tradition.

==Western culture==

===Historical status===
[[File:Seuso and his wife at Lake Balaton.jpg|thumb|Seuso and his wife]] 
In premodern heterosexual unions ([[ancient Roman]], [[medieval]], and early modern history), a husband was obliged to protect and support not only his wife and children, but servants and animals of his domain. The  father (as the "[[patron]]") was awarded with much [[authority]], differing from that of his wife (in these cultures, no polygamy existed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_text_mommsen_1_5_2.htm|title=The History of Rome, by Theodor Mommsen  Book I Chapter 5 Section 2|work=About.com Ancient/Classical History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Early Modern]] European history, it was unusual to marry out of love, but then doing so became an influential ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgn.org/sgnnews34_45/page6.cfm|title=SGN Page 6|author=|date=|website=www.sgn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William C. Horne, Making a heaven of hell: the problem of the companionate ideal in English marriage, poetry, 1650–1800 Athens (Georgia), 1993&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, a husband in a heterosexual marriage had more opportunities in society than his wife, who was not recognized as legally independent.&lt;ref&gt;William Blackstone, Commentaries upon the Laws of England&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary status===
In contemporary [[secularized]] Western culture, the rights of the spouses have been made equal. The [[civil marriage]] generally forces the wealthier spouse "''breadwinner''" to provide [[alimony]] to the former spouse, even after separation and also after a divorce (see also [[Law and divorce around the world]]).

The legal status of marriage allows each spouse to speak on the other's behalf when one is incapacitated (e.g., in a coma); a husband is also responsible for his spouse's child(ren) in states where he is automatically assumed to be the [[biological father]].&lt;ref&gt;Cuckoo's egg in the nest, Spiegel 07, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==

===Islam===
In [[Islamic marital jurisprudence]], husbands are considered protectors of the household and their wives. As protector, the husband has [[Rights and obligations of spouses in Islam|various rights and obligations]] that he is expected to fulfill and thus is offered opportunities different from that of his wife or wives, not only in legal and economical affairs of the family but within the family as well. As in most cases in Islam law and culture, everything is being related to the [[Qur'an]].

Many Muslims may agree on a perfectly equal relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[[Heba Kotb|Heba G. Kotb MD]], [http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/kotb2.htm Sexuality in Islam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709125251/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/kotb2.htm |date=9 July 2011 }}, PhD Thesis, Maimonides University, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Islam is the only major religion that puts a cap on [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]], limiting the number of a man's wives to four—provided the husband can do justice to all of them. Although some religions, such as Catholicism for instance, puts a cap on polygamy all together, or even serial monogamy, allowing one spouse until death does them apart, not even accepting divorce. According to the teachings of Islam a Muslim man should have a valid reason and have to get permission from his existing wife (without any force) if he requires to marry again. Islam vehemently abhors any intimate relationship outside the bond of marriage.

There is no external sign to show his status as a husband, unless he adopted the tradition of wearing a wedding ring.

===Hinduism===
{{See also|Marriage in Hinduism}}
A Hindu husband traditionally takes his wife to his home. He is expected to provide for her and to prove his abilities to do so. The marriage in Hinduism is a relationship for Seven births (सात जन्मों का रिश्ता). Before 1951 there was no divorce allowed in Hindu marriage. In past before 1750CE equal rights were given to both men and women and the same was extended in marriage as well.

In modern times once again after 1951, equal rights for women through society and law jurisdiction is given. In Hinduism, based on the different regions, marriage process is observed differently with the same Saat Pheras around agni kund (light pyre) to be taken to become a husband and wife.

The [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] mentions that "In Hindu law, the male members of a joint family, together with their wives, widows, and children, are entitled to support out of the joint property."&lt;ref&gt;Britannica, ''Economic aspects of family law (from family law)''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism and Chinese folk religions===
China's family laws were changed by the Communist revolution; and in 1950, the People's Republic of China enacted a comprehensive marriage law including provisions giving the spouses equal rights with regard to ownership and management of marital property.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica 2004, ''Legal limitations on marriage (from family law)''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christianity ===
In Christianity, according to the Bible, a husband in a heterosexual marriage has a number of honors:
* To present his bride to God throughout their lives as perfectly holy and virtuous as can be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%253A26-27&amp;version=ESV|title=Ephesians 53A26-27 ESV -  - Bible Gateway|website=www.biblegateway.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To protect his wife with his own life, physically, emotionally and "spiritually".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-28.htm|title=Ephesians 5:28 In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.|website=biblehub.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To "lay down" his life, counting her more important than himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-25.htm|title=Ephesians 5:25 Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her|website=biblehub.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To lead his wife and his family into the best things for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-29.htm|title=Ephesians 5:29 After all, no one ever hated their own body, but they feed and care for their body, just as Christ does the church--|website=biblehub.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To be the best that he can be in God's power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm|title=Galatians 5:22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,|website=biblehub.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To not withhold his body from her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-5.htm|title=1 Corinthians 7:5 Do not deprive each other except perhaps by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.|website=biblehub.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other cultures==
In Japan, before enactment of the [[Meiji Constitution|Meiji]] Civil Code of 1898, all of the woman's property such as land or money passed to her husband except for personal clothing and a mirror stand.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica, ''Legal limitations on marriages (from family law)''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expectation of fidelity==
{{Main article|Adultery|Open marriage}}
Although there is generally an expectation for a spouse not to have [[sexual relation]]s with anyone other than his spouse(s), historically, in most cultures, this expectation was not as strong as in the case of wives, a situation which was evident in legal codes which prohibited adultery, with male adultery often being criminalized only if "aggravating" circumstances existed, such as if he brought his mistress in the conjugal home, or if there was public scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=NtitRt1uUXMC |title=Women and Achievement in Nineteenth-Century Europe }}&lt;/ref&gt; The double standard was also evident in divorce laws of many countries, such as the UK or Australia, which differentiated between female adultery, which was a ground of adultery by itself, and male adultery, which was a ground only under certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aifs.gov.au/institute/seminars/finlay.html&lt;/ref&gt; This double standard continues to be seen today in many parts of the world. For instance, in the Philippines, a wife can be charged with the crime of a''dultery'' (for merely having one act of sexual intercourse with a man other than her husband), while a husband can only be charged with the related crime of c''oncubinage'', which is more loosely defined (it requires either keeping the mistress in the family home, or cohabiting with her, or having sexual relations under scandalous circumstances).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genderindex.org/country/philippines|title=Gender Equality in Philippines - Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI)|work=genderindex.org|access-date=22 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430025115/http://genderindex.org/country/philippines|archive-date=30 April 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jlp-law.com/blog/a-brief-discussion-on-infidelity-concubinage-adultery-and-bigamy/|title=A brief discussion on Infidelity, Concubinage, Adultery and Bigamy|work=Philippine e-Legal Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A breach of this expectation of [[fidelity]] is commonly referred to as [[adultery]] or [[extramarital sex]]. Historically, adultery has been considered a serious [[offense (law)|offense]], sometimes a crime. Even if that is not so, it may still have legal consequences, particularly a divorce. Adultery may be a factor to consider in a [[property settlement]], it may affect the status of children, the [[custody of children]], etc.

'''Jane Grossman Stern''' and '''Michael Stern''' (both born 1946) are American writers who specialize in books about travel, food, and popular culture. They are best known for their ''[[Roadfood]]'' books, website, and magazine columns, in which they find [[road food]] restaurants serving classic American regional specialties and review them. Starting their hunt for regional American food in the early 1970s they were the first food writers to regard this food as being as worthy to report on as the [[haute cuisine]] of other nations. 

Since the Sterns began documenting regional American food in the 1970s many other writers and television personalities have used their pioneering work as inspiration. In addition to their early work with regional American food the Sterns' book ''Square Meals'' (Knopf 1985) put "[[comfort food]]s" like mac and cheese, meatloaf, and mashed potatoes on the culinary map. ''Square Meals'' did an audacious reverse spin on the tricked up and precious nouvelle cuisine that was beloved by food critics at that time.     

Jane Grossman grew up in [[New York City]], where she attended the [[Walden School (New York City)|Walden School]] and received a BFA in graphic design at [[Pratt Institute]] in Brooklyn. Michael Stern grew up in [[Winnetka, Illinois]], and graduated from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1968. They met as graduate students in art at [[Yale University]] and their first date, at [[Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana|Pepe's Pizza]] in New Haven, had a food focus.&lt;ref name=Ephron&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple married in 1970. The following year, Jane earned an MFA in painting from Yale and Michael changed schools and earned an MFA from [[Columbia University]] in film. Neither found work in their fields of study.

After a short stint of producing documentaries for WNBC, a teaching job at [[Hunter College]] and another at [[Wesleyan University]] they began work on the book that eventually became the first ''Roadfood''. The book was conceived as a book on "truck-stop dining," funded with an advance from a publisher. The Sterns set out in their car to travel through the United States and eat up to 12 meals daily at diners and local cafes.&lt;ref name=Ephron/&gt; The resulting first edition of ''Roadfood'' was published in 1977; the most recent edition was released in 2017.

In addition to their food writing, the Sterns have written books on American popular culture, including [[New York Times bestseller list|''The New York Times'' bestselling]] ''Elvis World'' (1987) and ''The Encyclopaedia of Bad Taste'' (1990). In all, they have written over 30 books. They were staff writers for ''[[Gourmet (magazine)|Gourmet]]'' magazine for 18 years, have written for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', and are now contributing editors at ''[[Saveur]]''. 

They are regular guests on [[American Public Media]]'s public radio program, ''[[The Splendid Table]]''. They have won numerous awards, including [[James Beard award]]s, and were inducted into [[James Beard Foundation Award#Who's Who of Food and Beverage in America|Who's Who of Food and Beverage in America]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamesbeard.org/index.php?q=james_beard_awards_whos_who Who’s Who of Food &amp; Beverage in America], the James Beard Foundation website, accessed September 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Sterns founded Roadfood.com; the site was sold to Fexy Media in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Gordinier| first = Jeff| title = Serious Eats and Roadfood Are Sold to Fexy Media| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2017-11-13| date = 2015-06-02| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/dining/serious-eats-roadfood-websites-sold-to-fexy-media.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the sale, the Sterns remained in charge of editorial content of their website.&lt;ref name="eater-2015jun02"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.eater.com/2015/6/2/8704397/serious-eats-roadfood-seattle-fexy-media |title=Serious Eats Is Acquired by Seattle-Based Fexy Media: Roadfood has also been sold to Fexy Media. |website=Eater |date=June 2, 2015 |first=Daniela |last=Galarza}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Jane Stern published ''Ambulance Girl: How I Saved Myself by Becoming an EMT'', a memoir in which she described suffering from severe [[clinical depression]] when she was in her early 50s and overcame her depression by training and working as an [[emergency medical technician]] in Connecticut. In 2005 the book was made into a [[television movie]], ''[[Ambulance Girl]]'', for which actress [[Kathy Bates]] was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]]. The Sterns wrote a joint memoir, ''Two for the Road: Our Love Affair With American Food'', in 2006. 

The couple divorced in 2008; they still write as a team.&lt;ref&gt;Nanci G.

In 2011 the former couple published ''The Lexicon of Real American Food'', and Jane Stern published a book on her little known but long-standing career as a [[tarot card reader]]. &lt;ref&gt;Nanci G.

'''Kupanta-Kurunta''' was the first recorded [[king]] of [[Arzawa]], in the late 15th century BC. He was defeated by [[Tudhaliya I]] and [[Arnuwanda I]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Routledge Handbook of The People and Places of Ancient Western Asia'' by Trevor Bryce&lt;/ref&gt; He then attacked Arnuwanda's restive vassal [[Madduwatta]] at [[Zippasla]]. He had a daughter, who married Madduwatta.

Another '''Kupanta-Kurunta''' was born in the 1330s or 1320s BC at [[Mira (Anatolia)|Mira]] in western [[Anatolia]], in one of the princely families. His father joined a coup against king [[Mašḫuiluwa]]. The [[Hittites|Hittite]] king [[Suppiluliuma I]] married Mašḫuiluwa to his daughter Muwatti and reinstalled him. Kupanta-Kurunta's father apparently died or was exiled soon after. Mašḫuiluwa then asked Suppiluliuma's successor [[Mursili II]] if he could adopt Kupanta-Kurunta as a son.

Mira remained a Hittite ally against [[Uhha-Ziti]] of Arzawa; but two years after [[Mursili's eclipse]] (which would mean 1310 BC) Mira rebelled under influence from "Great-House-Father" (probably an adventurer from Masa). Mursili quashed this rebellion, transferred Mašḫuiluwa to a priesthood in [[Hittites|Hittite]] territory, and installed Kupanta-Kurunta as king.

In the early 13th century BC, [[Muwatalli II]] signed a treaty with Alaksandu of [[Wilusa]]. In it, he informed Alaksandu that he viewed Kupanta-Kurunta as the son of Muwatti and so a member of the Hittite royal family.

Kupanta-Kurunta is possibly the recipient of the [[Milawata letter]].

Kupanta-Kurunta apparently supported [[Hattusili III]] over Hattusili's nephew Urhi-Tessup, "[[Mursili III]]". After Hattusili attained the kingdom, Kupanta-Kurunta received a letter from Pharaoh [[Rameses II]] which was copied to Hattusili. In it, the Pharaoh reassured Kupanta-Kurunta that [[Egypt]] remained a full ally of [[Hittite Empire|Hatti]] and entertained no plans to aid Urhi-Tessup in any further adventures.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters of the Great Kings of the Ancient Near East'' by [[Trevor Bryce]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12331">'''Legal name''' is the [[name]] that identifies a person for legal, administrative and other official purposes. A person's first legal name generally is the name of the person that was given for the purpose of [[Civil registry|registration of the birth]] and which then appears on a [[birth certificate]] (see ''[[birth name]]''), but may change subsequently. Most [[Jurisdiction|jurisdictions]] require the use of a legal name for all legal and administrative purposes, and some jurisdictions permit or require a [[name change]] to be recorded at [[marriage]]. The legal name may need to be used on various government issued documents (e.g., a court order). The term is also used when an individual changes his/her first or full name, typically after reaching a certain legal age (usually eighteen or over, though it can be as low as fourteen in several European nations).

A person's legal name typically is the same as his/her [[personal name]], comprising a [[given name]] and a [[family name]]. The order varies according to culture and country. There are also country-by-country differences on changes of legal names by marriage. (See ''[[married name]]''.)

Most countries require by law the registration of a name for newborn children, and some can refuse registration of "undesirable" names. In 1991, a [[Sweden|Swedish]] couple refused to give their newborn a legal name, in protest of existing naming laws. In 1996, they were fined for not registering a name for their child for five years, after they unsuccessfully tried to register the child's name as [[Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Baby named Metallica rocks Sweden|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6525475.stm|accessdate=February 3, 2012|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=April 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then as "A".

==Jurisdiction by country==
===Canada===
====Quebec====
The ''[[Civil Code of Quebec]]'' states that "Every person exercises his civil rights under the name assigned to him and stated in his act of birth,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CCQ|5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spouses retain their legal names upon marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CCQ|393}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be changed, upon registration, only under prescribed conditions, and only where the person is a Canadian citizen who has been domiciled in Québec for at least one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CCQ|57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.etatcivil.gouv.qc.ca/en/change-name.html|title= Change of name|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= 1 December 2016|website= etatcivil.gouv.qc.ca|location=Quebec|publisher= Directeur de l'état civil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In Germany, names are regulated to a large extent. Apart from possibly [[Married name#Germany|adopting the partner's name]] upon marriage, German citizens may only change their name for a recognised important reason. Among other reasons, a change of names is permitted when the name can give rise to confusion, ridicule, unusual orthographic difficulties, or stigmatization. In certain situations, children's last names may also be changed to their natural, foster or adoptive parent's last name. Transgender people may change their first names. Foreign names in writing systems that are not based on Latin are transliterated according to rules which may conflict with the system of transcribing or transliterating names that is used in the country of origin. Former titles of nobility became integrated into the last names in 1919 but continue to be adapted according to gender and other circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Seeger|first=Bernhard|title=Der Ehe- und Lebenspartnerschaftsname in der notariellen Praxis|year=2002|journal=Mitteilungen des Bayerischen Notarvereins|url=http://www.notare.bayern.de/read.php?datei=UERGUy9NaXR0QmF5Tm90L21pdHRCYXlOb3Q0XzAyLnBkZg==|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320233430/http://www.notare.bayern.de/read.php?datei=UERGUy9NaXR0QmF5Tm90L21pdHRCYXlOb3Q0XzAyLnBkZg==|archivedate=2012-03-20|df=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, businesses that trade under names other than those of the owner or a corporate entity must display the name of owner and an address at which documents may be served, or the name and registered number of the corporate body and its registered address. The requirements apply to sole traders and partnerships, but there are special provisions for large partnerships where listing all partners would be onerous. 

The information must be shown on any trading premises where the public have access to trade and in documents such as order forms, receipts and, as of January 2007, corporate websites (to be extended later in 2007 to sole trader websites).

====England and Wales====
In strict English law, if there is such a thing as a "''legal''" surname, it is easily changed. In the words of ''A dictionary of American and English law'', "Any one may take on himself whatever surname or as many surnames as he pleases, without statutory licence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Rapalje|first1= Stewart|last2= Lawrence|first2= Robert L.|date= 1997|title= A Dictionary of American and English Law with Definitions of the Technical Terms of the Canon and Civil Laws|edition= 3rd|volume= 2|location= [[Clark, New Jersey]]|publisher=The Lawbook Exchange|page= 849|isbn= 978-1-886363-33-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This does not always seem to have applied to names given in [[baptism]]. As noted by [[Edward Coke|Sir Edward Coke]] in ''[[Institutes of the Lawes of England]]'', "a man may have divers names at divers times, but not divers Christian names."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Butler|editor1-first=Charles|last= Coke|first= Edward|date= 1832|title= The First Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England|url= https://books.google.ca/books?id=NOgyAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;f=false|edition=19th|volume=1|location= |publisher= |at= Lib.1 Cap.1 Sect. 1, at 3.a|isbn= |author-link= Edward Coke}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But in modern practice all names are freely changeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/overview|title= Change your name by deed poll |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |access-date= 12 April 2017|website= gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes of name are usually effected through [[deed of change of name|deed poll]], optionally enrolled either at the [[High Court of Justice]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite legislation UK | type = si| year = 1994| number = 604| si = Enrolment of Deeds (Change of Name) Regulations 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; or at the [[College of Arms]],&lt;ref name="CONCOA"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/services/name-change|title= Changes of name|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= college-of-arms.gov.uk|publisher= [[College of Arms]]|access-date=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a notice recorded in ''[[The London Gazette]]''. Changes may also be made by means of a Royal License obtained through the College of Arms, with similar notice.&lt;ref name="CONCOA"/&gt; These enrolment, licence and notice procedures are useful for having the new name appear in official documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/overview|title= Change your name by deed poll |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |access-date= 12 April 2017|website= gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scotland====
Scots Law allows anyone who wishes to do so to change their forename(s) or surname and such changes may be recorded in the official register held by the [[National Records of Scotland]].  Technically the Registrar General makes a correction to the entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/registration/about-registration-in-scotland|title=About registration in Scotland|last=|first=|date=21 July 2018|website=National Records of Scotland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A correction can be recorded where a birth has been registered in Scotland, or where a person is the subject in Scotland of an entry in the Adopted Children Register, the Parental Order Register or the Gender Recognition Register.&lt;ref name="NRS"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/registration/rcn1-leaflet.pdf |format=pdf |title=Leaflet RCN1: Recording changes of forename(s) and surname(s) in Scotland | publisher=National Records of Scotland |website=www.nrscotland.gov.uk |accessdate=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The above formalities are not necessary where a spouse/partner assumes the other spouse/partner's surname upon marriage or civil partnership, or reverts back to their original name upon separation, divorce or dissolution of the civil partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Recording Changes of Forename(s) and Surname(s) in Scotland|url=http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/registration/recording-change-of-forename-and-surname-in-scotland|website=www.nrscotland.gov.uk|publisher=National Records of Scotland|accessdate=16 April 2017|date=2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only one change of name is allowed in the register where a person has not yet reached the age of 16, and afterwards only one change of forename and three changes of surname may be granted during a person's lifetime, provided that at least five years have passed between changes of surname.&lt;ref name="NRS" /&gt; Name changes may also be recorded where:

* a decree or certificate has been granted by the [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]],
* a certified copy of a [[Will (law)|will]], [[Settlement (trust)|settlement]] or [[Trust instrument|deed of trust]] is produced, containing a condition that the person concerned takes a name different from his or her registered name, or
* an alternative forename or surname is used where the registered name is not in an English-language form.&lt;ref name="NRS" /&gt;

====Northern Ireland====
Anyone born or adopted in Northern Ireland is able to change their name with the [[General Register Office (Northern Ireland)|General Register Office of Northern Ireland]] in the following circumstances:&lt;ref name="GRONI"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/recording-change-name|title= Recording a change of name|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= 2015-10-26|website= nidirect.gov.uk|publisher= [[General Register Office (Northern Ireland)|General Register Office of Northern Ireland]]|access-date= 17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* a child's birth registration can be re-registered where its parents have subsequently married, or where a father that had not previously been identified is subsequently entered (whether by declaration, agreement or court order);
* a child's name can be changed once, before the age of 18, upon application by the parents (or adoptive parents, or guardian where the parents are deceased, as the case may be);
* a person aged 18 or over may apply to register one change of forename and three changes of surname during that person's lifetime, provided that at least five years have passed between changes of surname.

A deed poll can also be used in Northern Ireland for this purpose.&lt;ref name="GRONI"/&gt;

===United States===
Most states in the United States follow the [[common law]] which permits [[name change#United States|name changing]] for non-fraudulent purposes. This is actually the most common method, since most women who marry do not petition a court under the statutorily prescribed method, but simply use a new name (typically the husband's, a custom which started under the theory of [[coverture]] where a woman lost her identity and most rights when she married).&lt;ref&gt;''In re Natale'', 527 S.W.2d 402 (Mo. App. 1975); ''In re Kruzel'', 226 N.W.2d 458 (Wis. 1975).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most [[List of courts of the United States|state courts]] have held that a legally assumed name (i.e., for a non-fraudulent purpose) is a legal name and usable as their true name, though assumed names are often not considered the person's technically true name.&lt;ref&gt;''Stuart v. Board of Supervisors'', 295 A.2d 223 (Md. Ct. App. 1972); ''In re Hauptly'', 312 N.E.2d 857 (Ind. 1974); ''United States v. Cox'', 593 F.2d 46 (6th Cir. 1979).  ''See also'' 10 U.S.C. § 1551 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''legal name''' of a business is the name under which the business conducts its operations.

These mythological monarchs supposedly ruled Fib, the reigns of these monarchs are mostly legendary and begin in the 7th century BCE with king Fib. The reigns of these monarchs are attributed to the Pictish chronicles, written in the 10th century during the reign of King Kenneth II of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://anthonyadolph.co.uk/the-pictish-king-list/|title=Pictish King List|website=anthonyadolph.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For later monarchs see [[List of Pictish kings|List of Pictish Kings]]. Fib became a puppet state after the reign of the only true king Fib, it was a sub-kingdom from the 7th century BCE until the 9th Century CE (691 BCE - 837/843 CE) when Pictland was united under Kenneth MacAlpin, the last king to rule Pictland before Kenneth was Drest X thus making him the last king of the Fib puppet-state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kjhskj75z.talktalk.net/pictish.html|title=THE PICTISH CHRONICLE|website=www.kjhskj75z.talktalk.net|access-date=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of notable travelers''', consisting of people that are known for their travels or explorations. Travel is the movement of people between relatively distant geographical locations, and can involve travel by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, airplane, or other means, and can be one way or round trip.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/travel "Travel."] (definition).

[[File:King Henry VIII from NPG (3).jpg|thumb|220px|A portrait of Henry VIII, painted c. 1520]]

In legal terms, [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII of England]] had only three wives, because three of his putative marriages were annulled. Unlike a divorce, where a married couple chooses to end their union, [[annulment|annulments]] essentially declare that a true marriage never took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/11358279/Henry-VIII-didnt-really-have-six-wives-why-everything-you-know-about-the-Tudors-is-wrong.html|title=Did Henry VIII really have six wives?

==Overview==
The six women who were married to Henry VIII were, in chronological order:

{| class="wikitable" 
|- 
! No. !! Name !! Married from - through !! Fate of marriage !! Fate of wife and issue 
|- 
| 1 || [[Catherine of Aragon]] || 11 June 1509 – 23 May 1533 || Annulled || Died 7 January 1536 while detained in [[Kimbolton Castle]].&lt;br&gt;Mother of [[Mary I of England|Mary I]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Erickson |first1=Carolly |title=Great Harry: A Biography of Henry the VII |date=2007 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=0-312-16858-6 |page=48 |accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|- 
| 2 || [[Anne Boleyn]] || 28 May 1533 – 17 May 1536 ||  Annulled || Beheaded 19 May 1536 at the [[Tower of London]].&lt;br&gt;Mother of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]
|- 
| 3 || [[Jane Seymour]] || 30 May 1536 – 24 October 1537 || Died  || Died 24 October 1537, twelve days after giving birth due to complications.&lt;br&gt;Mother of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]

|- 
| 4 || [[Anne of Cleves]] || 6 January 1540 – 9 July 1540 || Annulled || Died possibly of cancer in 16 July 1557 
|- 
| 5 || [[Catherine Howard]] || 28 July 1540 – 23 November 1541 || Beheaded || Beheaded 13 February 1542 at the Tower of London

|- 
| 6 || [[Catherine Parr]] || 12 July 1543 – 28 January 1547 || Widowed || Survived Henry VIII. Later remarried to Thomas Seymour. Died 7 September 1548.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hanson |first1=Marilee |title=Katherine Parr --Facts, Information, Biography &amp; Portraits |url=https://englishhistory.net/tudor/monarchs/katharine-parr/ |website=English History |accessdate=23 September 2018 |date=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

Henry's first marriage lasted nearly 24 years; the five that followed less than 10 years combined.

A common [[mnemonic device]] to remember the fates of Henry's consorts is "Divorced, beheaded, died, divorced, beheaded, survived". There are also two rhymes:{{cn|date=June 2017}}{{year needed|date=June 2017}}

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;King Henry VIII,
To six wives he was wedded.
One died, one survived,
Two divorced, two beheaded.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

and

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Boleyn and Howard lost their heads,
Anne of Cleves he would not bed,
Jane Seymour gave him a son – but died before the week was done,
Aragon he did divorce,
Which just left Catherine Parr, of course!&lt;/poem&gt;}}

It is often noted that [[Catherine Parr]] "survived him." In fact, [[Anne of Cleves]] also survived the king, and was the last of his queens to die. Of the six queens, [[Catherine of Aragon|Katherine of Aragon]], [[Anne Boleyn]], and [[Jane Seymour]] each gave Henry one child who survived infancy: two daughters and one son. All three of these children would eventually ascend to the throne: [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]], [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]], and [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]].

Catherine Howard and Anne Boleyn, the two of Henry's queens who were beheaded, were first cousins. Several of Henry's wives worked in at least one of his other wives' service, typically as [[lady-in-waiting|ladies-in-waiting]]: Anne Boleyn worked in Catherine of Aragon's service, Jane Seymour worked in Catherine of Aragon's and Anne Boleyn's, and Catherine Howard worked in Anne of Cleves's.

Henry and at least four of his wives (Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour, and Catherine Parr) were portrayed in [[List of historical opera characters|opera]].

[[Catherine of Aragon|Katherine of Aragon]] (16 December 1485{{spaced ndash}}7 January 1536; {{lang-es|link=no|Catalina de Aragón}}) was Henry's first wife.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Although her name is sometimes spelled ''Catherine'', Katherine of Aragon spelled and signed her name with a "K," which was the accepted spelling in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_of_Aragon#Spelling_of_her_name|title=Catherine of Aragon|last=Wikipedia|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}{{circular inline|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-4891|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|last=Davies|first=C.S.L.|last2=Edwards|first2=John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=England|pages=|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/4891|chapter-url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-4891|doi-access=Free|chapter=Katherine [Catalina, Catherine, Katherine of Aragon] (1485-1536)}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of [[Arthur, Prince of Wales|Arthur]], her first husband and Henry's brother, a [[papal dispensation]] was obtained to enable her to marry Henry, though the marriage did not take place until after he came to the throne in 1509. Prospects were looking good when Katherine became pregnant in 1510, just 4 months after their marriage, but the girl was stillborn. Katherine became pregnant again in 1511, and gave birth to a boy, [[Henry, Duke of Cornwall]], who died almost two months later. In 1513, Katherine gave birth to a stillborn boy, and gave birth to a boy who died within hours in 1515. Finally, Katherine bore him a healthy daughter in 1516, [[Mary I of England|Mary]]. It took her two years to conceive again. This pregnancy ended in a short-lived girl. It is said that Henry truly loved Katherine of Aragon, as he himself professed it many times in declarations, etc.

Henry, at the time a Roman Catholic, sought the Pope's approval for an [[annulment]] on the grounds that his marriage was invalid because Katherine had first been his brother's wife, using a passage from the Old Testament (Leviticus Chapter 20 Verse 21) to justify his stance: "If a man shall take his brother’s wife, it is an impurity; he hath uncovered his brother’s nakedness; they shall be childless.” 
Henry had begun an affair with [[Anne Boleyn]], who is said{{by whom|date=July 2016}} to have refused to become his mistress (Henry had already consummated an affair then dismissed Anne's sister, [[Mary Boleyn]], and most historians believe that Anne wanted to avoid the same treatment){{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. Despite the pope's refusal, Henry separated from Katherine in 1531. In the face of the Pope's continuing refusal to annul his marriage to Katherine, Henry ordered the highest church official in England, [[Thomas Cranmer]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], to convene a court to rule on the status of his marriage to Katherine. On 23 May 1533,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lacey Baldwin Smith, Henry VIII: The Mask of Royalty, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Cranmer ruled the marriage to Katherine null and void. On 28 May 1533, he pronounced the King legally married to Anne (with whom Henry had already secretly exchanged wedding vows, probably in late January 1533). This led to the break from the Roman Catholic Church and the later establishment of the [[Church of England]].
 
[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] called Katherine "The Queen of Earthly Queens."

Marriage to Henry VIII: 11 June 1509 – 23 May 1533 (23 years, 11 months, 19 days); marriage annulled.

==Anne Boleyn==
{{Main article|Anne Boleyn}}
[[File:Anne boleyn.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Anne Boleyn]]
[[Anne Boleyn]] (c.1501/1507{{spaced ndash}}19 May 1536) was Henry's second wife and the mother of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. Henry's marriage to Anne, and her subsequent execution, made her a key figure in the political and religious upheaval that was the start of the [[English Reformation]]. The daughter of Sir [[Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire|Thomas Boleyn]] and his wife, [[Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire|Lady Elizabeth Boleyn]] (born Lady Elizabeth Howard), Anne was of nobler birth than [[Jane Seymour]], Henry's later wife. She was dark-haired, with beautiful features and lively manners; she was educated in Europe, largely as a [[lady-in-waiting]] to [[Claude of France|Queen Claude of France]].

Anne resisted the King's attempts to seduce her in 1526 and she refused to become his mistress, as her sister, [[Mary Boleyn]], had been. It soon became the one absorbing object of the King's desires to secure a divorce from his wife, [[Catherine of Aragon]], so he could marry Anne. Evidence of intimacy between the King and Anne is found in a love letter written by the King, in which he expressed admiration for her "pretty duckies" (breasts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/henrytoanne.htm|title=Love Letter of King Henry VIII to Anne Boleyn, 1533.|website=www.luminarium.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it became clear that [[Pope Clement VII]] was unlikely to give the king an annulment, the breaking of the power of the Roman Catholic Church in England began.

Henry had [[Thomas Wolsey]] dismissed from public office and later had the Boleyn family's chaplain, [[Thomas Cranmer]], appointed [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. In 1533, Henry and Anne went through a secret wedding service.&lt;ref name="wbe-boleyn"&gt;"Anne Boleyn 1507–1536." World Book Encyclopedia. "19th ed". 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; She soon became pregnant and there was a second, public wedding service, which took place in London on 25 January 1533. On 23 May 1533, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Catherine null and void. Five days later, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Anne to be good and valid. Soon after, the Pope launched sentences of [[excommunication]] against the King and the Archbishop. As a result of Anne's marriage to the King, the [[Church of England]] was forced to break with Rome and was brought under the king's control.&lt;ref name="wbe-boleyn" /&gt;
Anne was crowned [[List of English consorts|Queen Consort of England]] on 1 June 1533. Later that year, on 7 September, Anne gave birth to Henry's second daughter, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]. When Anne failed to quickly produce a male heir, her only son being stillborn, the King grew tired of her, annulled their marriage, and a plot was hatched by [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]] to execute her.

Although the evidence against her was unconvincing, Anne was beheaded on charges of [[adultery]], [[incest]], and [[high treason]] on 19 May 1536. Following her daughter [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]'s coronation as queen, Anne was venerated as a martyr and heroine of the English Reformation, particularly through the works of [[John Foxe]]. Over the centuries, Anne has inspired or been mentioned in numerous [[Anne Boleyn in popular culture|artistic and cultural works]].

Marriage to Henry VIII: 28 May 1533{{spaced ndash}}17 May 1536 (2 years, 11 months, 19 days); annulled, then beheaded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tudorhistory.org/boleyn/|title=Anne Boleyn|website=tudorhistory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jane Seymour==
{{Main article|Jane Seymour}}
[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - Jane Seymour, Queen of England - Google Art Project.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Jane Seymour]]
[[Jane Seymour]] (c.roughly 1508{{spaced ndash}}24 October 1537) was Henry's third wife. She served [[Catherine of Aragon]] and was one of [[Anne Boleyn|Anne Boleyn's]] ladies-in-waiting.&lt;ref&gt;Jokinen, Anniina. "[http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/sixwives.htm The Six Wives of King Henry VII]" 2007. Web. 7 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It is strongly believed{{who|date=December 2014}} that she is the mistress who disposed of Anne, who was executed just 10–11 days before Jane's marriage to the king. The daughter of a knight, she was of lower birth than most of Henry's wives. Finally, a year later, Jane gave birth to a healthy, legitimate male heir, [[Edward VI of England|Edward]], but she died twelve days later, presumably because of post-natal complications. This apparently caused her husband genuine grief, as she was the only queen to receive a proper Queen's burial; when the King died in 1547, he was buried next to her.

Marriage to Henry VIII: 30 May 1536{{spaced ndash}}24 October 1537 (1 year, 4 months, 24 days); death from complications of childbirth.

==Anne of Cleves==
{{Main article|Anne of Cleves}}
[[File:AnneCleves.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Anne of Cleves]]
[[Anne of Cleves]] (22 September 1515{{spaced ndash}}16 July 1557) was Henry's fourth wife, for only six months in 1540, from 6 January to 9 July. Anne of Cleves was a German princess.&lt;ref&gt;"Anne of Cleves." World Book Encyclopedia. "19th ed". 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been stated that Henry referred to her as "''A Flanders Mare''", which may or may not be true; nevertheless, the label has stuck with Anne.&lt;ref&gt;Burnett "History of the Reformation of England" Print&lt;/ref&gt; Her pre-contract of marriage with [[Francis I, Duke of Lorraine]], was cited as grounds for an annulment. Anne agreed to this, claiming that the marriage had not been consummated, and because she hadn't resisted the annulment, was given a generous settlement, including [[Hever Castle]], former home of Henry's former in-laws, the Boleyns. She was given the name "The King's Sister", and became a friend to him and his children until his death. She outlived both the King and his last two wives, making her the last of the six wives to die.

Marriage to Henry VIII: 6 January 1540{{spaced ndash}}9 July 1540 (6 months, 3 days); annulled.

==Catherine Howard==
{{Main article|Catherine Howard}}
[[File:HowardCatherine02.jpeg|150px|right|thumb|Catherine Howard]]
[[Catherine Howard]] (c.1521{{spaced ndash}}13 February 1542) was Henry's fifth wife between 1540–1542, sometimes known as "the rose without a
thorn". Henry was informed of her alleged adultery with [[Thomas Culpeper]] on 1 November 1541.&lt;ref&gt;"Catherine Howard." World Book Encyclopaedia. "19th ed". 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marriage to Henry VIII: 28 July 1540{{spaced ndash}}23 November 1541 (1 year, 3 months, 26 days); beheaded.

==Catherine Parr==
{{Main article|Catherine Parr}}
[[File:Catherine Parr from NPG.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Catherine Parr]]
[[Catherine Parr]] (1512{{spaced ndash}}5 September 1548), also spelled Kateryn, was the sixth and last wife of Henry VIII, 1543–1547. She was the daughter of [[Sir Thomas Parr]] of Kendal and his wife [[Maud Green]]. Through her father, Catherine was a descendant of [[John of Gaunt]], son of King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]. Through John of Gaunt's daughter [[Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmoreland]] (Henry's great-great grandmother), she was Henry's third cousin, once removed. By Henry's paternal descent from another of John of Gaunt's children, [[John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset]], the two were also fourth cousins once removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lundy |first=Darryl |url=http://www.thepeerage.com/e274.htm |title= e274.htm&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |publisher= The Peerage}}{{Unreliable source?|failed=y |date=February 2013}}&lt;!--Lundy is not a reliable source so cite Lundy's reliable source See [[WP:SAYWHEREYOUREADIT]]--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Catherine showed herself to be the restorer of Henry's court as a family home for his children. Catherine was determined to present the royal household as a close-knit one in order to demonstrate strength through unity to Henry's opposers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Perhaps Catherine's most significant achievement was Henry's passing of an [[Third Succession Act|act]] that confirmed both [[Mary I of England|Mary]]'s and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]'s line in succession for the throne, despite the fact that they had both been made illegitimate by divorce or remarriage. Such was Henry's trust in Catherine that he chose her to rule as Regent while he was attending to the [[Italian War of 1542–46|war in France]] and in the unlikely event of the loss of his life, she was to rule as Regent until nine-year-old [[Edward VI of England|Edward]] came of age.

Catherine also has a special place in history as she was the most married queen of England, having had four husbands in all; Henry was her third. She had been widowed twice before marrying Henry. After Henry's death, she married [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas Seymour]], uncle of [[Edward VI of England]], to whom she had formed an attachment prior to her marriage with Henry. She had one child by Seymour, [[Mary Seymour|Mary]], and died shortly after childbirth. Lady Mary's history is unknown, but she is not believed to have survived childhood.

Marriage to Henry VIII: 12 July 1543{{spaced ndash}}28 January 1547 (3 years, 6 months, 16 days); his death at the age of 55.

==Ancestry==
Henry was distantly related to all six of his wives through their common ancestor, King [[Edward I of England]],&lt;ref&gt;Antonia Fraser, ''The Wives of Henry VIII'', genealogical tables&lt;/ref&gt; through more than one ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tudorqueen6.com/2012/09/22/english-ancestry-of-the-six-wives-descent-from-edward-i/|title=English Ancestry of The Six Wives: Descent from Edward I|date=22 September 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The noted antiquarian and heraldist [[Charles Boutell]] commented that the: "Arms of Queen Anne Boleyn are the first which exemplify the usage, introduced by Henry VIII, of granting to his Consorts "Augmentations" to their paternal arms. It is a striking illustration of the degenerate condition of [[Heraldry]] under the second [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor Sovereign]]."&lt;ref name="Boutell 242"/&gt; The dexter supporter was intended to represent the leopard of [[Guyenne]] (Aquitaine). The sinister supporter was a [[Charge_(heraldry)#Animals|heraldic creature]] from the badge of the Boleyn, as descended from Earls of Ormond (Butler).&lt;ref name="Willment 69"&gt;Willement p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; The falcon badge was granted to Anne as Countess of Pembroke, this badge was also used by her daughter Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]].

The sinister supporter was inherited from her maternal grandfather William FitzHugh, 4th Baron FitzHugh. Her badge was granted by the King, it combined the Tudor rose badge of Henry with a previous one used by the Queen's family. The House of Parr has assumed as a badge "a maiden's head, couped below the breasts, vested in ermine and gold, her hair of the last, and her temples encircled with red and white roses." This they inherited from the badge of Ross, of Kendal.&lt;ref name="Willment 75"&gt;Willement p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6166">'''The Little Tough Guys''' (later billed as 'The Dead End Kids and Little Tough Guys') were a group of actors who made a series of films and serials released by [[Universal Studios]] from 1938 through 1943.  Many of them were originally part of [[Dead End Kids|The Dead End Kids]], and several of them later became members of [[East Side Kids|The East Side Kids]] and [[The Bowery Boys]].

==History==
{{main|Dead End Kids}}
The urban drama ''Dead End'' became both a successful play and a hit movie, featuring six young actors playing streetwise guttersnipes: [[Billy Halop]], [[Leo Gorcey]], [[Huntz Hall]], [[Gabriel Dell]], [[Bobby Jordan]], and [[Bernard Punsly]]. The troupe became known as [[The Dead End Kids]] and starred in a series of features for [[Warner Brothers]].

==Little Tough Guys==
In 1938, [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] borrowed the Dead End Kids (except Gorcey and Jordan) for a juvenile-delinquency drama called ''[[Little Tough Guy]]''. Universal adopted this as a brand name, and turned the film into a series of 'Little Tough Guys' features. The studio filled out the cast with David Gorcey (Leo's younger brother) and [[Hal E. Chester|Hally Chester]]. 

The next three films did not include any of the original Dead End Kids. ''Little Tough Guys in Society'' (1939) was more of a lightweight comedy, while the next two, ''Newsboys' Home'' and ''Code of the Streets'' (1939), were more dramatic. [[Jackie Cooper]] starred in ''Newsboys' Home'', but was not a member of the team. Only David Gorcey and Hally Chester remained from the first film, ''Little Tough Guy''. This was the beginning of the members of the team changing on almost a film-to-film basis. Eleven actors drifted in and out of the series, including [[Frankie Thomas]], Charles Duncan (who was originally hired to play Leo Gorcey's role in the play ''Dead End''), and [[Billy Benedict]]. 

When Warners released Bobby Jordan from his contract, Universal quickly signed him to join the rest of gang. Now, with five of the original six Dead End Kids on the payroll, Universal revised the billing to read "The Dead End Kids and Little Tough Guys". In total, the Little Tough Guys made 12 feature films, and three 12-chapter serials. Leading player Halop joined the armed forces and was replaced by Jordan for the final film in the series, ''Keep 'Em Slugging'', released in 1943.

[[Shemp Howard]] of the [[Three Stooges]] appeared in ''Give Us Wings'', ''Hit The Road'' and ''[[Keep 'Em Slugging]]''. Huntz Hall cited Howard as a major influence when his later "Bowery Boys" series shifted to all-out slapstick comedy.

There was still a market for these tough-teen films, and most of the Little Tough Guys principals wound up at [[Monogram Pictures]] as [[The East Side Kids]] and [[The Bowery Boys]].

'''Llwyd ap Cil Coed''' is a character in the Third Branch of The [[Mabinogi]], known also as the story of ''[[Four Branches of the Mabinogi#Manawyddan, son of Llyr|Manawydan ap Llŷr]]''. 

==Role in the Third Branch==

Llwyd is a friend of [[Gwawl]] ap Clud, who had been insulted by [[Pwyll]] in the First Branch. Llwyd decides to avenge this insult upon [[Pryderi]] son of Pwyll by making barren and empty the kingdom of [[Dyfed]]. Later, by means of an enchanted bowl in a mysterious fortress, he imprisons Pryderi and [[Rhiannon]], Pwyll's widow and Pryderi's mother. Llwyd apparently makes Rhiannon bear the yokes of his horses, while Pryderi had to carry the gate hammers, while they are in captivity. 

Only [[Manawydan]], Rhiannon's new husband, and Pryderi's wife [[Cigfa]] remain in Dyfed. They try to plant grain, but their crop is destroyed by mice. Manawydan chases the pests away, but catches one that is fat and slower than the others, and sets out to hang it for theft. A cleric, a priest, and a bishop come by one at a time and beg Manawydan to spare the mouse, but he refuses until the bishop agrees to remove the enchantment from Dyfed. He finally reveals himself as Llwyd in disguise, and admits that the mice were really his attendants magically transformed. The mouse is his pregnant wife, Gwenaby, but Manawydan refuses to free her until Llwyd also releases Rhiannon and Pryderi and pledges to take no further revenge. Llwyd agrees to these terms, and turns his wife back into a beautiful woman.

==Other appearances==

A character named '''Llwydeu ap Cilcoed''' appears in the early [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] tale ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'' in which he is named as one of the many knights of [[King Arthur|Arthur's]] court. After stealing a [[cauldron]] from Diwrnach the Irishman, Arthur and his men land at Llywdeu's house in Porth Cerddin in [[Dyfed]].

[[File:Man In The Moon2.png|thumb|200px|Some Pareidolias in the moon]]
'''Lunar pareidolia''' refers to the [[Pareidolia|pareidolic]] images seen by humans on the face of the [[Moon]]. The Moon's surface is a complex mixture of dark areas (the [[Lunar mare|lunar ''maria'']], or "seas") and lighter areas (the highlands). Many cultures have seen shapes in these dark and light areas that have reminded them of people, animals or objects, often related to their [[folklore]]; the most famous are the [[Man in the Moon]] in Western folklore and the [[Moon Rabbit]] of Asia and the Americas. Other cultures perceive the silhouette of a [[Chang'e (mythology)|woman]], a [[frog]], a [[moose]], a [[American Bison|buffalo]], or a [[dragon]] (with its head and mouth to the right and body and wings to the left) in the full moon. Alternatively, the vague shape of the overall dark and light regions can resemble a [[Taijitu|Yin Yang symbol]].

==The Man in the Moon==
{{Main article|Man in the Moon}}
[[File: Man in the Moon with key.jpg|thumb|left|200px|One possible interpretation of the Man in the Moon as seen from the Northern Hemisphere]]
The Man in the Moon is an imaginary figure resembling a human face, head or body, that observers from some cultural backgrounds typically perceive in the bright disc of the [[full moon]].

==Rabbit/hare==
{{Main article|Moon rabbit}}
[[File:Rabbit in the moon standing by pot.png|thumb|150px|Rabbit with a pot – making medicine, [[mochi]], or [[tteok]]]]

In [[Culture of China|Chinese culture]], the rabbit in the moon (a companion of [[Chang'e (mythology)|Chang'e]]) is pounding medicine. Similarly, in [[Japan]] and [[Korea]], popular culture sees a rabbit making [[mochi]] and [[tteok]], respectively, in the moon.

In [[Pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]] the rabbit is often associated with the moon, for example, [[Tecciztecatl]], the [[Aztec]] moon god, was pictured as an anthropomorphic rabbit; there is also a myth involving [[Quetzalcoatl]] and the moon rabbit.

==Female figures==
In [[Elizabethan England]], the spots of the Moon were supposed to represent a witch carrying sticks of wood on her back, or an old man with a lantern (which was illustrated by [[Shakespeare]] in his comedy ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''). A more recent Western image is the profile of a coiffed woman wearing a jeweled pendant, the jewel being the crater [[Tycho (crater)|Tycho]], which at full moon is very bright and has bright radiating lines ([[Ray system|rays]]). In New Zealand [[Māori mythology|Māori legend]], the moon shows a woman with a local tree, the ''[[Myoporum laetum#Maori legend|Ngaio]]''. However, throughout [[Melanesia]] and [[Polynesia]], the moon is seen to be a cook over a three-stone fire.

In [[Chinese Mythology]], [[Chang'e]] (various spellings) lives on the moon. She was mentioned in the conversation between Houston Capcom and [[Apollo 11]] crew just before the first moon landing:&lt;ref&gt;[http://anarchy-manga.com/Onions/onion-club-manga-emoticons-wallpapers.php Onion-Club, Chang-e, About the Moon Festival] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305233856/http://anarchy-manga.com/Onions/onion-club-manga-emoticons-wallpapers.php |date=2012-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toad==
"The toad was seen by Chinese Taoists as ... the moon, representing Chang-O, the transformed wife of Yi, the excellent archer. ... According to Robert M. DeGraaff, in some representations of the moon-toad, the ''ling chih'' fungus is shown growing out of the creature's forehead."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yXPXTbrJULgC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;lpg=PA157&amp;dq=Cheng-o+toad&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NVyvO2GFTz&amp;sig=WipE6K8JaB9Mrv8Yjl49349ab6Q&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=oZyhSaKlLZ6Dtwfsh836DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result Adrian Morgan : ''Toads and Toadstools''.

==Ali==
[[Shia Muslims]] believe that the name of [[Ali]] Ibne-Abi Talib ([[Muhammad]]'s son in law) is written on the moon. This interpretation has roots in several [[hadith]] by Muhammad where he compares Ali to the moon and himself to the sun. There are also other esoteric interpretations of this analogy in Islamic philosophy.

[[Image:FML names-2.png|thumb|300px|First/given, middle, and last/family/surname diagram with [[John Fitzgerald Kennedy]] as example. This shows a structure typical for English-speaking cultures (and some others). Other cultures use other structures for full names.]]
In several cultures, a '''middle name''' is a portion of a [[personal name]] that is written between the person's [[given name]] and their [[surname]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/middle%20name |title=Middle name - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person may be given a middle name regardless of whether it's necessary to distinguish them from other people with the same given name and surname. In cultures where a given name is expected to precede the surname, additional names are likely to be placed after the given name and before the surname,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/381383/middle-name |title=middle name (language) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus called middle names. In English-speaking American culture, that term is often applied (arguably mistakenly) to names occupying that position even if the bearer would insist that that name is being mistakenly called a "middle name", and is actually (to mention several types of common cases): 
* part of a two-word given name (e.g. ''[[Mary Anne]]'', about [[Mary Anne Clarke]], and "[[Joe Bob Briggs]]"), 
* a [[maiden name]] (e.g. [[Hillary Clinton|Rodham]]), 
* a [[patronymic]] (e.g. [[Nikita Khrushchev|Sergeyevich]]), 
* a [[baptismal name]] (e.g. "Christopher" invoking [[Saint Christopher]]), or
* a maternal [[surname]] (such as in Portuguese and Brazilian names).
 
In the [[United States]], such names are specifically referred to as middle names; in most other countries, as far as they are given names and not, for example, [[patronymic]]s, they would simply be regarded as second, third etc. given names. In the U.S., the "middle name" is often [[abbreviated]] to the '''middle initial''' (e.g. Mary Lee Bianchi becomes Mary L. Bianchi, which is usually standard for [[signature]]s{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}) or omitted entirely in everyday use (e.g. just Mary Bianchi). An individual may have more than one middle name, or none. In the United Kingdom, for comparison, she would usually be referred to as either Mary Bianchi, M. L. Bianchi or Mary Lee Bianchi, or she may choose Lee Bianchi, and informally there may be familiar shortenings.

It is debatable how long multiple given names have existed in English-speaking countries, but it is certain that among royalty and aristocracy the practice existed by the late 17th century (and possibly earlier), as exemplified in the name of the Stuart pretender [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (1688–1766).

Despite their relatively long existence in North America, the phrase "middle name" was not recorded until 1835, in the periodical ''[[Harvardiana]]''.

The use of multiple middle names has been somewhat impeded recently{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} by the increased use of [[software|computer]] [[database]]s that occasionally allow for only a single middle name or more commonly a middle initial in storing personal records, effectively preventing people with multiple middle names from being listed in such [[databases]] under their full name. This is worsened by longer compound names, like [[María del Pilar Pereyra]] or [[María de las Nieves García]].

The abbreviation "N.M.N." (no middle name) or "N.M.I." (no middle initial), with or without periods, is sometimes used in formal documents in the United States, where a middle initial or name is expected but the person does not have one. The middle name can also be a maiden name.

Since 1905, "middle name" has also developed a figurative usage meaning a notable or outstanding attribute of a person, as in the phrase "discretion is my middle name."

==English==
In countries that primarily speak English—such as [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Ireland]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United States]], and the [[United Kingdom]]—the forename of a relative is sometimes used as one's middle name to honor familial heritage.&lt;ref name=genfiles&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.genfiles.com/articles/middle-names/ | title=The Use of Middle Names| date=2013-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases in the United States, however, a person's middle name has little or no lineage-related context, and is used instead to honor close family friends or notable public figures.&lt;ref name=genfiles/&gt;

In the United States, those who choose to be known primarily by their middle name may abbreviate their first name as an [[initial]], e.g. [[J. Edgar Hoover]] (John Edgar Hoover). Others simply omit the first name, like [[Woodrow Wilson]] (Thomas Woodrow Wilson). A rare case of an individual being given only an initial as a middle name, with the initial not explicitly standing for anything, was [[Harry S. Truman]]. (He once told reporters—apparently at odds with his own practice—that the S should thus not be followed by period.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/speriod.htm | title=Truman: The "S" Period}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than two given names are fairly common. In England they are traditionally more common among the "upper classes" and "middle classes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nameberry.com/blog/british-baby-names-two-middle-names | title=British Baby Names: Two middle names| date=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[W.E.B. Du Bois]], [[George H. W. Bush]].

Middle names can also be used as first names. Major examples are [[Paul McCartney]], [[Mitt Romney]], [[Dakota Fanning]], [[Elle Fanning]], [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Jonathan Demme]], [[Riley Keough]], [[Reese Witherspoon]], [[Hayley Orrantia]], [[Brad Pitt]], [[Ashton Kutcher]], [[Meghan Markle]], [[Rihanna]], [[Scott Chandler (American football)|Scott Chandler]], [[Nomar Garciaparra]], [[Bill Mumy]], [[Roger Waters]] and [[Jim Acosta]].

=== Chinese ===
{{Further|Chinese name|Generation name|Courtesy name|Art name}}
Traditionally, Chinese names consisted of three characters—the surname, followed by a two-character given name (''ming''), which is not separated into a first and middle name in usage.  Two-character given names follow a naming tradition in which the first character of the given name (and thus the second character in the three-character full name) indicates the person's generation in his/her family.  For example, the [[Yongzheng Emperor]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] has the given name ''Yinzhen'' (胤禛) while his brothers' names all begin with the character "Yin" (胤).  His sons' and nephews' given names all begin with the character ''Hong'' (弘). Traditionally, the list of generational names may be decided many generations in advance by the ancestors.  In such naming systems, the de facto given name is the last character of a person's full name. Even if that was the case most of the time, sometimes the person's given name is the middle character and not the last. A three-character name is both patriarchal and hierarchical, as it would inform of a person's belonging and rank within a family. During the [[One-child_policy|One-child Policy]], there was no need for a generation name as there was only one child in each generation. Many names in Mainland China were shortened to two-characters during this time, and there are many adults with shorter names remnant from this era. This would not be found in Taiwan or Hong Kong.

A fading Chinese tradition is to use a [[courtesy name]], called ''zì'' (字) in place of a male's given name in adulthood.  Traditionally ''zì'' is given by one's father upon reaching the age of maturity at 20 years old.  This name is intended for use in formal situations and formal writing and confers a status of adulthood and respect.  Like the ''ming'', the ''zì'' is composed of two characters which usually reflect the meaning of the ''ming''.  Prior to the 20th century, sinicized Koreans, Vietnamese, and Japanese were also referred to by their ''zì''.  An alternative courtesy name is the ''hào'' ({{zh|s=号|t=號|p=hào|labels=no}}; Japanese gō; Korean: ho; Vietnamese: hiệu), which usually referred to as the pseudonym. A ''hào'' was usually self-chosen and it was possible to have more than one. It had no connection with the bearer's ''míng'' or ''zì''; rather it was often a personal choice and may have reflected a personal belief or philosophy. Chinese adults may more frequently use the ''hào'' to refer to themselves. The ''zì'' or ''hào'' can be used independently of the given name and of each other, but the given name is almost always used with the family name in official situations.

Some [[Chinese American]]s move their Chinese given name ([[Romanization of Chinese|transliterated]] into the [[Latin alphabet]]) to the middle name position and use an English first name, e.g. [[James Soong|James Chu-yu Soong]], [[Jerry Yang (entrepreneur)|Jerry Chih-Yuan Yang]], and [[Michelle Kwan|Michelle Wingshan Kwan]]. The Chinese given name usually has two characters which are usually combined into a single middle name for better organizational purposes, especially with [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] names, such as [[Bruce Lee]]'s middle name, Junfan. There are also some new immigrants whose Chinese given names are their first names followed by English middle names.

The practice of taking English and Chinese given names is also common in [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Taiwan]]. However, rather than placing the Chinese given name between the English given name and the family name, it is commonly placed after the family name in these places. Under such a system, Bruce Junfan Lee would have been Bruce Lee Junfan. This practice is consistent with both the Western convention of putting the given name before the family name and the Chinese convention of putting the given name after the family name.

==Scandinavia==
In [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]], the term middle name refers to names that are originally surnames, but not part of the last name of the name bearer. The term middle name does not refer to additional given names, which are instead referred to as given names. A middle name could be e.g. one's mother's maiden name or the last name of another recent ancestor (for instance a grandparent). One can have several middle names, but it is unusual to have more than one or two. In law, middle names have a separate status. In practice, their status is similar to that of additional given names, and middle names are often omitted in everyday use, just like a person with 3 or 4 given names would only use one of them in most situations. The historical purpose of middle names is to honour some related family or person, a godparent, or even a completely unrelated person, such as a locally or nationally prominent figure. Until the 19th century, it was not unusual to have the last name of a godparent as one's middle name, even when the godparent was not a blood relative. This practice, and the use of middle names in general, however, was mostly limited to the bourgeois class and the nobility, and was seldom seen among common people. In the 20th century, the use of middle names, especially one's mother's maiden name, was more widely adopted, although it is by no means mandatory. There are few set rules for how names are constructed today; people are required to have one given name and one family name, but can have as many additional given names and middle names as they like.

In the example [[Carl Viggo Manthey Lange]], the names Carl and Viggo are given names, while Manthey is a middle name and Lange is the family name. Manthey is his mother's maiden name. Unless his full name is used, he is correctly referred to as Mr. Lange, not as Mr. Manthey Lange. Carl Viggo Manthey Lange has a name typical of the Norwegian bourgeois class, with both his family name and his middle name being of foreign origin and being recognised surnames. Most Norwegians and Danes of the working class and peasant class used [[patronymic]]s until the 19th century, when permanent family names became mandatory, first in Denmark in the early 19th century and then in Norway around 1900. A middle name is usually a recognised surname and not a patronymic. One reason middle names have become popular in the 20th century, particularly in Denmark, is that most Danish surnames originated as patronymics and are shared by a large number of people. The use of middle names in modern times serves to differentiate them from other people. For example, Danish politician [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen]] has some of the most common given and last names in Denmark (Lars and Rasmussen); his mother's maiden name is the slightly more unusual name Løkke, derived from a small agricultural property, so he uses it as a middle name, which differentiates him from other people named Lars Rasmussen.

In [[Sweden]], the position is much the same as in Denmark. Middle names were inaugurated in the previous Name Act of 1963, then called "tilläggsnamn" (additional name), and are called "mellannamn" (middle name) as of the present Name Act of 1983. However, it had previously been more common to join e.g. the last names of both of a child's parents, or for a married woman to join her maiden name and the husband's last name, as a double name with a hyphen; and large portions of the Swedish population have not adapted to the official system to this day, i.e. for almost 50 years. People often use a hyphen between their middle name and last name themselves, and/or are spelled that way by other people and by mass media.

Furthermore, when the term middle name was introduced in Swedish ("mellannamn") the word was assumed by many to mean the additional given names (apart from the "name of address" (''tilltalsnamn'')), so since 1983 the word is being used more and more in this, officially, erratic meaning.

Occasionally, Scandinavians choose to use their middle name as their surname in everyday life. So [[Gottfrid Svartholm|Per Gottfrid Svartholm Warg]] has Per and Gottfrid as his given names, where Gottfrid, not Per, is his name of address, Svartholm as his middle name and Warg as his last name, but in practice he uses Svartholm as a surname. This usage, however, is unofficial. Historically, a middle name could become part of a double-barreled surname (family name) and hence cease to be a middle name, especially if used for several generations. There are many family names of this kind, which contributes to the confusion about middle names that shall not be hyphenated. Some of these double-barreled surnames are combined with a hyphen, while others are not, so a double surname without a hyphen can sometimes be indistinguishable from a middle name followed by a family name.

In Scandinavia, there is no limit on how many given names one can have. Given names have never been referred to as middle names, apart from many in Sweden believing so, as mentioned above. The use of more than two or three given names is generally associated with the upper class. The first given name is not necessarily the name of address. For the sake of completeness, Swedish forms often ask people to fill in all their given names and to indicate which one is their "name of address" (''tilltalsnamn'').

==Southeast Asia==

===Vietnam===

{{Further|Vietnamese name}}

Traditional middle names in Vietnamese are "Văn" for male names and "Thị" for female names. However, modern Vietnamese do not consider these to be attractive names, especially "Thị". Therefore, nowadays popular middle names also are popular first names. Middle names play an important role in Vietnamese full names; they could help creating beautiful names when combine with first names, distinguishing people who have the same first name (there are many common last names in Vietnam), and also distinguishing the gender of the names ([[unisex name]]s are used widely in Vietnam). Hence, Vietnamese rarely abbreviate their middle names.

===Philippines===
{{further information|Filipino name}}

For Filipinos, the middle name is usually the maternal surname, which is the maiden surname of a person's mother. The use of the maternal surname as middle name is from American influence, where Filipinos adopted English naming customs, when they once used [[Spanish naming customs]], that used two surnames (paternal and maternal) joined with the particle ''y'' (or ''e'', before "i"), which remains in use but became restricted to  very formal purposes, police records and legal proceedings. In the Spanish naming system, the middle name corresponds to the maternal surname. The middle name (or the maternal surname) is usually being abbreviated to a middle initial. Thus, a person with the full name ''Juan Santos Macaraig'', with ''Santos'' the middle name in the present order, may become ''Juan S. Macaraig'' with the middle name abbreviated, and ''Juan Macaraig y Santos'' in the Spanish system, such as those used in names on police records, especially those seen on name placards held by a convicted person on official [[mug shot]]s. The Philippine system, using "given name-middle name-surname" order (or "Christian name-mother's surname-father's surname") coincidentally follows the [[Portuguese name|Portuguese]] naming system that uses two surnames, the first being maternal and the second being paternal.

But, the maternal surname may not be the middle name at some cases. It may be a second given name, like what the term really means, as in ''[[Jose P.  Laurel]]'', where "P." (a middle initial)  corresponds to ''Paciano''.

In illegitimate children, the middle name is the maiden surname of the mother, and the middle name (maternal surname) of the mother as surname, but the surname become of the father's upon legal and administrative acknowledgement by his/her father. Children of a single father takes no middle name, even when the mother's identity is known. 

To illustrate that, the daughter of an unmarried couple named ''Ana Cristina dela Cruz Manansala'' and ''Jose Maria Panganiban Lozada'', named '"Maria Cristina'", will be named ''Maria Cristina Manansala dela Cruz'' (or ''Ma. Cristina M. dela Cruz''), with Ana Cristina's middle name,  ''dela Cruz'', as surname. But once Jose Maria wants to acknowledge her as his child legally and administratively, Maria Cristina will take the surname ''Lozada'', but keep the maternal surmame ''Manansala'' as middle name, thus, ''Maria Cristina Manansala Lozada'' (or ''Ma. Cristina M. Lozada''). As the daughter of only Jose Maria, Maria Cristina will be rather called ''Maria Cristina Lozada'' or ''Ma. Cristina Lozada'', even when the mother is known.

In married women, the middle name usually corresponds to the maiden surname, but on professional society, women usually add the husband's surname after their maiden name, keeping the maternal surname. A married woman may decline taking the husband's surname and keep her maiden name as no Philippine law compels women to take her husband's surname. Thus, a woman named ''Maria Concepcion Perez Limchauco'' (or ''Ma. Concepcion P. Limchauco''), once marrying ''Juan Pablo Sanchez Marasigan'' (or ''Juan Pablo S. Marasigan'') may take the name ''Maria Concepcion Perez Limchauco-Marasigan'' (or ''Ma. Concepcion P.  Limchauco-Marasigan''), maintaining the maternal surname ''Perez'', ''Maria Concepcion Limchauco Marasigan'' (or ''Ma. Concepcion L. Marasigan''), taking the maiden surname ''Limchauco'' as middle name and ''Marasigan'' as married surname, or keep her maiden names, remaining ''Maria Concepcion Perez Limchauco'' upon marriage.

== Latin America ==
In Argentina, most people have a middle name. According to a study, approximately 9 out of 10 Argentines born in 2010 had a middle name given to them. It used to be even more common in the past, as it is an old tradition. It's very common to use the name of a grandparent as middle name. It is termed "segundo nombre" (lit. second name). However, its widespread use is slowly shrinking due to the influence of neighboring countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/segundo-nombre-pasa-moda-usa-poner-solo_0_ryME5BGvb.html | title=El segundo nombre pasa de moda: Se usa poner sólo uno}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Actually, most of south-american, especially Hispanic citizens are acquainted with the use of compound given names, such as Maria + (second given name) or Juan + (given name), among others. This is often considered a useful way of distinguishing from similar or identical names considering that Spanish-derived surnames are strikingly common in some cultural regions (e.g. Luis Fernandez can be better distinguished if arranged as Luis Antonio Fernandez, José Luis Fernandez, Luis Eduardo Fernandez, etc.).

The '''Muan''', '''Moan''' or '''Mohan''' (moo-ahn), sometimes also known as '''Poira''' is a name applied to several mythological or otherwise supernatural creatures in [[South America|South]] and [[Latin American folklore|Central American folklore]]. The most common and widespread use of the term is to refer to the souls of the dead and the indigenous ancestors of old. The word is also used for [[shaman]]s or [[witch doctor]]s in some [[Colombia]]n indigenous cultures (such as the [[:es:Panche|Panche]]s).
[[File:Mohan pijao.JPG|thumb|right|Un muñeco de Mohán.]]
==History==
Various different legends exist about the Mohan, with many of them emerging from Colombia. In Colombia, Mohan can also mean a forest or barren land kind of supernatural being associated with natural forces such as the great rivers and the mysteries lying within the forests, beyond human reach and comprehension. In some legends, it is a [[satyr]]-like being who steals and rapes young women and lives in a cave-like grotto in the bottom of the great jungle rivers where he keeps his female captives. In others, it is depicted as the spirit of an old Indian, brawny and stout, with a terrifying grin and stare, with larger than human stature and proportions, who steals fishermen's bait, catch or nets, and has the power to change shape into a cat-like beast.

[[File:Navneforandring.jpg|thumb|right|Name change certificate issued by Christian X of Denmark in 1917]]
'''Name change''' generally refers to the legal act by a person of adopting a new name different from their name at birth, marriage or adoption.

The procedures and ease of a name change vary between jurisdictions. In general, [[common law]] jurisdictions have loose procedures for a name change while [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions are more restrictive.

A [[pseudonym]] is a name that differs from the original or true name and does not require legal sanction. It is generally adopted to conceal a person's identity, but can also be done for personal, social or ideological reasons.

==Reasons for changing one's name==
* Marriage or civil partnership. 
* To avoid a [[stalker]] or [[harassment|harassing]] person.
* To choose a surname associated with a hobby, interest, or accomplishment (e.g., old name Henry Schifberg, new name [[Henry Lizardlover]])
* To receive an inheritance conditional on adopting the name of the deceased (this reason was once quite common in landowning families in the UK)
* To replace a frivolous name given by their parents (e.g., old name Mikey Maus, new name Marcus Maus)
* To replace a name which might be considered undesirable with a more desirable one (e.g. old surname Lipschitz, new surname London)
* To dissociate oneself from a former religion (e.g., Ahmed Abdullah to Adel Karim) 
* To dissociate themselves from a famous or infamous person (e.g., old name [[Michael Jackson]] new name Martin Jackson)
* To identify with a famous or infamous person (e.g., old name Simon Johnson, new name Simon [[King Arthur|Pendragon]])
* To dissociate themselves from a family [[Black sheep (term)|black sheep]] (e.g., relatives of [[Adolf Hitler]]).
* To dissociate themselves from an ethnic origin (e.g. changing [[Battenberg family|Battenberg]] to [[Mountbatten]] or Jan Ludvik Hoch to [[Robert Maxwell]]).
* To revert to a former name (e.g., [[Cynthia Lennon]], first wife of [[John Lennon]], after her divorce from later husband John Twist).
* Commercial sponsorship (e.g., [[Jimmy White]] temporarily became Jimmy Brown for [[HP Sauce|HP brown sauce]],&lt;ref name="BBCBrown1"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/funny_old_game/4245973.stm "Jimmy Gets Saucy with Name Change"], no by-line, ''BBC News'' (online edition), "Sport: Fun and Games" section, 8 February 2005; accessed 14 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ashley Revell]] became Ashley blue square Revell for [[The Rank Group]]'s Blue Square service)
* Protest or activism (e.g., old name Jennifer Taylor, new name Jennifer [[Environmentalism|Save the Forests]])
* To change to a fictional character's name, (e.g. old name Tracy Darling, new name [[Tracy Beaker]])
* To make their name more attractive or "catchy" so as to increase their chance of success (see [[Stage name]])
* To change legal name to one used in everyday life, (e.g. where middle name has been used throughout life)
* To better fit one's [[gender identity]] as a [[transgender]] person (e.g., old name Bruce Jenner, new name [[Caitlyn Jenner]])

==United States==
In the United States, [[State law (United States)|state law]]s regulate name changes. Several federal court rulings have set precedents regarding both court decreed name changes and common law name changes (changing the name at will), including ''[[Lindon v. First National Bank]]''.

Usually a person can adopt any name desired for any reason. As of 2009, 46 states allow a person legally to change names by usage alone, with no paperwork, but a court order may be required for many institutions (such as banks or government institutions) to officially accept the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Julia Shear|last=Kushner|url=https://uclalawreview.org/pdf/57-1-7.pdf|title=The Right to Control One's Name|work=[[UCLA Law Review]]|issue=313|year=2009|pages=324–9}} The states which require a statutory name-change procedure are Hawaii, Louisiana, Maine, and Oklahoma.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the states (except Louisiana) follow common law, there are differences in acceptable requirements; usually a [[court order]] is the most efficient way to change names (which would be applied for in a [[State court (United States)|state court]]), except at marriage, which has become a universally accepted reason for a name change. It is necessary to [[pleading|plead]] that the name change is not for a [[fraud]]ulent or other illegal purpose, such as evading a [[lien]] or [[debt]] or for [[defamation|defaming]] someone else.

Applicants may be required to give a reasonable explanation for wanting to change their names. A fee is generally payable, and the applicant may be required to post legal notices in newspapers to announce the name change. Generally the judge has limited [[judicial discretion]] to grant or deny a change of name, usually only if the name change is for fraudulent, frivolous or [[Morality|immoral]] purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Edward J. Bander, ''Change of Name and Law of Names'' (Dobbs Ferry, New York: Oceana Publications, 1973) Ch. 2&amp;ndash;3.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2004, a [[Missouri]] man succeeded in changing his name to They.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/offbeat/2004-09-23-name-change_x.htm|work=USA Today|title=Missouri man legally changes his name to 'They'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Minnesota Supreme Court]] ruled that a name change to 1069 could be denied, but that Ten Sixty-Nine was acceptable (''Application of Dengler'', 1979); the [[North Dakota Supreme Court]] had denied the same request several years before (''Petition of Dengler'', 1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.court.state.nd.us/court/opinions/9205.htm|title=Petition of Dengler, 246 N.W.2d 758 (N.D. 1976)|work=state.nd.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In nearly all states, a person cannot choose a name that is intended to mislead (such as adopting a celebrity's name), that is intentionally confusing, or that incites violence; nor can one adopt, as a name, a [[racial slur]], a threat, or an [[obscene|obscenity]].

Some examples of typically allowed reasons for name changes in the U.S. include:
* Adopting a new surname upon marriage (typically the surname of the spouse, a [[hyphenated name|hyphenated surname]], or some combination of parts of both surnames).
* Returning to the use of a prior surname (e.g., a [[maiden name]]) upon divorce.
* Simplification or improved familiarity of spelling or pronunciation.

Under the federal immigration-and-nationality law, when aliens apply for [[naturalization]], they have the option of asking for their names to be changed upon the grants of citizenship with no additional fees. This allows them the opportunity to adopt more [[Cultural assimilation#Immigrant name changing as a form of assimilation|Americanized]] names.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.uscis.gov/files/form/n-400.pdf N-400 Application for Naturalization]", (US Citizenship and Immigration Services, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; During the naturalization interview, a petition for a name change is prepared to be forwarded to a [[United States federal courts|federal court]]. Applicants certify that they are not seeking a change of name for any unlawful purpose such as the avoidance of debt or evasion of [[Police|law enforcement]]. Such a name change would become final if within their jurisdiction, once a [[United States federal courts|federal court]] naturalizes an applicant.

To maintain a person's [[identity (social science)|identity]], it is desirable to obtain a formal order so there is continuity of personal records.

===Informal methods of legal name change===

====Assumed name====
The "open and notorious" use of a name is often sufficient to allow one to use an [[assumed name]]. In some jurisdictions, a trade name distinct from one's legal name can be registered with a county clerk, [[Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|secretary of state]], or other similar government authority. Persons who wish to publish materials and not to be associated with them may publish under [[pseudonym]]s; such a right is protected under [[case law]] pursuant to [[United States Constitution]].

====Usage method====
A common law name (i.e. one assumed for a non-fraudulent purpose) is a legal name.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', ''State v. Ford'', 172 P. 802; ''Bonnie Lee Daniels'', 337 A.2d 49; ''Elizabeth Marie Hauptly'' 312 N.E.2d 857; ''Piotrowski v. Piotrowski'', 247 N.W.2d 354; ''Thomas v. Thomas'', 427 N.E.2d 1009; ''Klein v. Klein'', 373 A.2d 86; ''Stuart v. Board of Elections'', 295 A.2d 223.&lt;/ref&gt; In most states a statutory method, while quick and definitive, only supplements the common law method,&lt;ref&gt;''In Matter of Linda A.'', 480 N.Y.S.2d 996.&lt;/ref&gt; unless the statute makes itself exclusive. Although a person may sue under a common law name.&lt;ref&gt;''Hoffman v. Bank of America'', (M.D. Florida 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[California]] the "usage method" (changing the name at will under common law) is sufficient to change the name.  Not all jurisdictions require that the new name be used exclusively.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Kreuter v US'', 201 F2d 33 (true name need not be abandoned), Florida Statute 322.22 (driver's licenses in two names), ''Loser v. Plainfield'', 128 N.W. 1101 (Iowa), ''Ludwinska v John Hancock'', 317 Pa 577 (may be used for just one nonfraudulent transaction).&lt;/ref&gt; Any fraudulent use or intent, such as changing the name to the same name as another person's name, may invalidate this type of name change.

Specifically in California, Code of Civil Procedure § 1279.5 and Family Code § 2082 regulate common law and court decreed name changes. Code of Civil Procedure § 1279.5 (a) reads, "Except as provided in subdivision (b), (c), (d), or (e), nothing in this title shall be construed to abrogate the common law right of any person to change his or her name." Subdivisions b through e preclude one from changing their name by common law if they are in state prison, on probation, on parole, or have been convicted of a serious sex offense. If a person is not in any of these categories, then a common law name change is allowed. (Family Code § 2082 also contains some of the same wording.)

====Preferred name====
Many universities, hospitals, and other institutions allow one to use a "preferred name" instead of one's legal name.  This name can show up on class rosters, online learning platforms, and student [[ID card]]s.  It provides a "transitional"
name change for those who have yet to, or cannot, receive a court-ordered name change.&lt;ref name="UC Davis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Preferred Name {{!}} Office of the University Registrar|url=https://registrar.ucdavis.edu/records/preferred-name.cfm|website=registrar.ucdavis.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leicester"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a preferred first name or preferred last name? — University of Leicester|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/hr/policies/ess/Questions/what-is-a-preferred-first-name-or-preferred-last-name|website=www2.le.ac.uk|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Official registration===
A legal name change is merely the first step in the name-change process. A person must officially register the new name with the appropriate authorities whether the change was made as a result of a court order, marriage, divorce, adoption, or any of the other methods described above. The process includes notifying various government agencies, each of which may require legal proof of the name change and that may or may not charge a fee. Important government agencies to be notified include the [[Social Security Administration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://faq.ssa.gov/link/portal/34011/34019/Article/3749/|title=How do I change or correct my name on my Social Security number card?|work=ssa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bureau of Consular Affairs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/passport/npic/agencies/agencies_913.html|title=U.S. Passports &amp; International Travel|work=state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for passports), the [[Federal Communications Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Forms/Form605/605.html|title=FCC Form 605|author=FCC Internet Services Staff|work=fcc.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422032207/http://transition.fcc.gov/Forms/Form605/605.html|archivedate=2014-04-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Selective Service System]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sss.gov/regisrantsbk.htm#RegistrantObligations|title=Selective Service System: Registrant Obligations|website=www.sss.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329020540/http://www.sss.gov/regisrantsbk.htm#RegistrantObligations|archivedate=2015-03-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Department of Motor Vehicles (for a new driver's license, learner permit, state identification card, or vehicular registration). Additionally the new name must be registered with other institutions such as employers, banks, doctors, mortgage, insurance and credit card companies. Online services are available to assist in this process either through direct legal assistance or automated form processing.

Although state requirements differ, it is generally recommended to first register a new name with the Social Security office as some state motor-vehicle departments require updated social security cards to make changes; [[Arizona]] is one of these states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azdot.gov/mvd/faqs/scripts/faqs.asp?section=dl#1|title=Motor Vehicle Services|work=azdot.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most states require name changes to be registered with their departments of motor vehicles (DMVs) within a certain amount of time. For example, [[South Carolina]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scdmvonline.com/DMVNew/default.aspx?n=general_driver_license_information#NameorAddressChanges {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228092155/http://www.scdmvonline.com/DMVNew/default.aspx?n=general_driver_license_information |date=2012-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wyoming]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dot.state.wy.us/Default.jsp?sCode=drvna] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919202553/http://dot.state.wy.us/Default.jsp?sCode=drvna|date=September 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; require a name change be registered with their office within ten days. [[Illinois]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberdriveillinois.com/publications/rules_of_the_road/rr_chap01.html#changing_name_address] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427004533/http://www.cyberdriveillinois.com/publications/rules_of_the_road/rr_chap01.html#changing_name_address|date=April 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Texas]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.txdps.state.tx.us/administration/driver_licensing_control/faq/answers_dl_id.htm#q18] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012023946/http://www.txdps.state.tx.us/administration/driver_licensing_control/faq/answers_dl_id.htm#q18|date=October 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vermont]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dmv.vermont.gov/licenses/change-name-address|title=Change Address or Name on Your License – Department of Motor Vehicles|website=dmv.vermont.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; require it be registered within 30&amp;nbsp;days, while [[North Carolina]] allows up to 60&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdot.org/dmv/driver_services/drivershandbook/chapter1/renewalLicense.html#RDNameChanges|title=NCDOT: License and ID|work=[[North Carolina Department of Transportation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York (state)|New York]] requires visiting a local motor vehicle office to change the name on all records and documents, but without a definite deadline to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dmv.ny.gov/dmvfaqs.htm#name|title=New York State DMV|work=New York State DMV|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626065446/http://www.dmv.ny.gov/dmvfaqs.htm#name|archivedate=2012-06-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fees for registering a new name vary from state to state. The forms, along with the state-specific requirements, can generally be obtained for free.

Many states will require reasons for wanting a name change. For example, in Florida, a court will not grant a petition for a change of name if it finds that (i) the petitioner has ulterior or illegal motives in seeking the name change, (ii) the petitioner's civil rights are suspended, or (iii) granting the name change will invade the property rights (''e.g.'', intellectual property rights) of others.&lt;ref&gt;see, e.g., [http://abcfamilylaw.com/practice-areas/change-of-name www.abcfamilylaw.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128015829/http://www.abcfamilylaw.com/practice-areas/change-of-name |date=2010-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], citizens and residents have the freedom to change their names with relative ease.

In theory, anyone who is at least 16 and resident in the United Kingdom can call themselves whatever they wish. However, over the past hundred years or so, formal procedures that are recognized by record holders such as government departments, companies and organizations have evolved, which enable a citizen legally to change the name recorded on their [[passport]], [[driving licence]], tax and [[National Insurance]] records, bank and credit cards, etc., provided that "documentary evidence" of a change of name is provided. Documents such as [[birth certificate|birth]], [[marriage certificate|marriage]] and educational certificates cannot be changed because these documents are "matters of fact", which means that they were correct at the time they were issued.

Documentary evidence of a change of name can be in a number of forms, such as a marriage certificate, [[decree absolute]], civil partnership certificate, [[statutory declaration]] or [[deed of change of name]]. Such documents are mere evidence that a change of name has occurred, however, and they do not themselves operate to change a person's name. Deeds of change of name are by far the most commonly used method of providing evidence of a change of name other than changing a woman's surname after marriage. A deed poll is a legal document that binds a single person to a particular course of action (in this case, changing one's name for all purposes). The term 'deed' is common to signed, written agreements that have been shown to all concerned parties. Strictly speaking, it is not a contract because it binds only one party and expresses an intention instead of a promise. 'Poll' is an old legal term referring to official documents that had cut edges (were polled) so that they were straight.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/files/deedpolls_notes_0308.doc ''Enrolling a Name Change in the Royal Courts of Justice''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002143613/http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/files/deedpolls_notes_0308.doc |date=2008-10-02 }} (March 2008).

===England and Wales===
People whose births are registered in England and Wales may have their deed poll enrolled at the [[Royal Courts of Justice]] in London.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; See also [[College of Arms#Change of names]].

====Historical usage====
{{See also|Double-barrelled name#British tradition}}
From the mediaeval age to the 19th century, the era of family dynasties, name changes were frequently demanded of heirs in the last wills and testaments, legacies and bequests, of members of the gentry and nobility who were the last males of their bloodline. Such persons frequently selected a younger nephew or cousin as the heir to their estates on condition that he should adopt the surname and armorials of the legator in lieu of his patronymic. Thus the ancient family otherwise destined to extinction would appear to continue as a great dynasty in the making. Such changes were also more rarely demanded by [[marriage settlement]]s, for example where the father of a sole daughter and heiress demanded that as a condition of his daughter's [[dowry]] her husband should adopt his father-in-law's surname and arms. Thus the progeny of the marriage would continue the otherwise extinct family's name. Such name changes were generally only demanded of younger sons, where an elder brother was available to inherit the paternal estates under primogeniture and carry on the name and arms abandoned by the younger brother. Such name changes were effected by obtaining a private [[Act of Parliament]] or by obtaining a Royal Licence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deedpolloffice.com/research#royal-licences|title=Researching a past change of name – D•P•O|work=Deed Poll Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; A less radical procedure adopted from the 18th century onwards was for the legator or settlor to demand only that the legatee or beneficiary should adopt his surname ''in addition to'' his patronymic, not in place of it, which gave rise to the "[[Double-barrelled name|double-barrelled]]", even the "triple-barrelled" name, frequently parodied in literature as epitomising the wealthy "[[squirearchy]]" with an embarrassment of inherited estates.

Well known examples are:
*Russell to Gorges (14th century). Ralph IV Gorges, 2nd Baron Gorges, died without issue in 1331. In an effort to preserve his family name and arms he made one of his younger nephews his heir, on condition that he should adopt the name and arms of Gorges. This nephew was William Russell, the second son of his second sister Eleanor de Gorges who had married Sir Theobald Russell (d.1341) of [[Kingston Russell]], Dorset. The event is referred to in one of the earliest heraldic law cases brought concerning English armory, [[Warbelton v. Gorges]] in 1347.
*Smithson to Percy (18th century). [[Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland|Sir Hugh Smithson, 4th Baronet]] (1715–1786) (c.1714–1786) in 1740 married [[Elizabeth Percy, Duchess of Northumberland|Lady Elizabeth Seymour]], daughter and sole heiress of [[Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset]], and granddaughter of Lady Elizabeth Percy (d.1722), daughter and sole heiress of [[Josceline Percy, 11th Earl of Northumberland]] (1644–1670). In 1740, by a private Act of Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deedpolloffice.com/research/private-acts-parliament/1749-23-Geo-2-14|title=Hugh Earl of Northumberland's name and arms. – D•P•O|work=Deed Poll Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smithson changed his surname to Percy and inherited the title [[Earl of Northumberland]] and was later created [[Duke of Northumberland]].

===Scotland===
People whose births are [[civil registration|registered]] in Scotland (or who were adopted in Scotland) can change their name in the same way as people from the rest of the United Kingdom.  However they can optionally apply to the [[Registrar General for Scotland]] to have their birth certificate amended to show the new name and have the respective register updated.

==Other common law countries==

=== Australia ===
Individuals may legally change their name through the [[States and territories of Australia|state and territory]] governments of Australia according to state or territory laws and regulations via agencies generally titled "Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australia.gov.au/information-and-services/family-and-community/births-deaths-and-marriages-registries|title=Births, deaths and marriages registries – australia.gov.au|first=Digital Transformation|last=Agency|website=www.australia.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Exceptions exist for some states such as restricted persons (e.g. jail inmate)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bdm.nsw.gov.au/Pages/change-of-name/change-of-name.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and in some states, changes may only be made once a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qld.gov.au/law/births-deaths-marriages-and-divorces/changing-your-name/changing-your-name/|title=Changing your name – Your rights, crime and the law|first=; c=AU; o=The State of Queensland; ou=Communication Services|last=Branch|website=www.qld.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutions such as banks,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.austrac.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/cip_form_ind_mar08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the Passports Office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.passports.gov.au/passportsexplained/theapplicationprocess/eligibilityoverview/Pages/confirmingidentity.aspx|title=Documents that confirm your Australian citizenship and identity|first=Australian Passports|last=Office|website=www.passports.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; and transport authorities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transport.wa.gov.au/licensing/change-my-name.asp|title=Change my name|first=|last=nw|website=www.transport.wa.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; require proof of identity, so people who change their names need to have proof of the change.

If a person's birth or adoption was registered in Australia, the change will also be noted (in most cases) on the person's birth or adoption registration, and in some states or territories, the name change can be evidenced either through a re-issued [[Birth certificate#Australia|birth certificate]] if born in Australia and/or "Change of Name Certificate".  These certificates are recognised secure [[Identity documents of Australia|identity documents]] and can be verified electronically through the [[Attorney-general of Australia]]'s Document Verification Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/IdentitySecurity/Pages/DocumentVerificationService.aspx|title=Document Verification Service|first=Attorney-General's|last=Department|website=www.ag.gov.au|access-date=2017-04-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321081501/https://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/IdentitySecurity/Pages/DocumentVerificationService.aspx|archive-date=2017-03-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada a person can informally call themselves whatever they want. In all provinces except [[Quebec]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/publications/generale/maria-a.htm#names {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123172016/http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/publications/generale/maria-a.htm |date=2010-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when someone gets married they can change their last name without legally changing their name by using their [[Marriage Certificate]] as verification of the name change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.programs.alberta.ca/Living/5962.aspx?Ns=364+6228&amp;N=770|title=Government of Alberta – Programs and Services – Getting Married|author=Government of Alberta|work=alberta.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is almost impossible for married women in Québec to take their husbands' names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=72ddc06b-4660-4b92-8b92-3a26ae24b377&amp;k=5969|title=Quebec newlywed furious she can't take her husband's name|work=Canada.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102072805/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=72ddc06b-4660-4b92-8b92-3a26ae24b377&amp;k=5969|archivedate=2016-01-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Like the United States, the requirements for a formal name change varies from province to province. Except for [[Ontario]], [[British Columbia]] and [[New Brunswick]], [[Canadians]] must be 18 to change their names and have lived in the province they are changing it in for at least 3 months to a year, depending on province. (In [[British Columbia]], Canadians must be 19 to change their names, in [[Ontario]] and [[New Brunswick]] 16.) People younger than the province's [[age of majority]] can change their names if they have their guardians' consent, are legally married, or have a [[common law marriage]].&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/name-change/how-to.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220124142/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/name-change/how-to.html|date=February 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; To change a name, a Name Change application must be submitted to either the Ministry of Government Services, Court of justice or Registrar of civil status. A document such as a birth certificate must be submitted. A statement as to why the name is being changed is needed in most areas and the reason has to be serious. In Canada, a name cannot cause confusion, be used for misrepresentation or fraud and in most cases the name change is announced in newspapers. There is a fee involved and it ranges from $10 to $185 depending on the territory or province.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt; [[British Columbia]], [[Alberta]] and [[Manitoba]] need [[Fingerprint recognition|fingerprints]] to be submitted before one changes their name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cba.org/BC/public_media/family/161.aspx] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023224732/http://www.cba.org/BC/public_media/family/161.aspx|date=October 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crcvc.ca/docs/How%20do%20I%20change%20my%20name.pdf|title=How do I change my name?|format=PDF|work=Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime|accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}
It is a common practice for ethnic Chinese residents of Hong Kong to adopt a western-style English name in addition to their transliterated Chinese name. As they often adopt western-style English names after being registered on the birth register, the fact that they want to include a western-style English name as part of their [[Legal name|legal English name]] is regarded as a name change which usually requires a deed poll.

However, the [[Immigration Department (Hong Kong)|Immigration Department]] which is responsible for processing applications for name change allows applicants to submit such applications without deeds poll; anyone who has a phonetic English name only and wishes to include a western-style English name as part of his or her legal English name can apply to the Immigration Department without a deed poll. Only one application of this kind is allowed for each applicant; any application for subsequent change(s) must be made with a deed poll.

===Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], a person earns their name by "use and repute". For most purposes it is enough to simply use the desired name and ask others to call you by that name. For some administrative purposes, such as changing a name on a driving licence or [[Legal aspects of transgenderism#Republic of Ireland|legally changing gender]], a [[deed of change of name]] must be registered with the [[Four Courts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth_family_relationships/problems_in_marriages_and_other_relationships/changing_your_name_by_deed_poll.html|title=Changing your name by deed poll|website=www.citizensinformation.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth_family_relationships/changing_to_your_preferred_gender.html|title=Changing to your preferred gender|website=www.citizensinformation.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
From September 1995, [[New Zealanders]] can change their name by making a [[statutory declaration]] and, if approved, the new name is registered with the Births, Deaths and Marriages section of the Department of Internal Affairs (Identity Services). Prior to September 1995, they changed their name by [[deed poll]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/Files/EOIStandard/$file/EOIStandard.pdf Evidence of Identity Standard] NZ Department of Internal Affairs, June 2006, Version 1.0, {{ISBN|0-478-24462-2}}, page 123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil law==
In general, unlike in [[common law]] countries, names cannot be changed at will in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions. Usually, a name change requires government approval and is only rarely granted, though legal name changes have become more common in some jurisdictions over the last years. The reason given for this system is usually the public interest in the unique identifiability of a person, e.g., in governmental registers, although with the advent of [[personal identification numbers]], that rationale may be in need of reconsideration.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Belgium===
In Belgian law, a name is in principle considered fixed for life, but under exceptional circumstances, a person may apply to the Ministry of Justice for a name change. This requires a Royal Decree (French: ''Arrêté royal'', Dutch: ''Koninklijk besluit'') for last names, but only a Ministerial Decree for first names. The new name must not cause confusion or cause damage to the bearer or others. Examples of requests that are usually considered favorably:
* A person of non-European origin who wants to adopt a less exotic name to further his/her integration in Belgian society
* A person stuck with a ridiculous last name that is causing him/her great embarrassment or emotional distress. Actual examples: Salami, Naaktgeboren ("born naked"), and Clooten ("sods of earth" in Middle Dutch, but "testicles" in modern Dutch)
* (for minor children) following legal adoption or recognition of paternity&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.just.fgov.be/nl_htm/informatie/htm_justitie_atotz/naamveranderen.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514153237/http://www.just.fgov.be/nl_htm/informatie/htm_justitie_atotz/naamveranderen.html|date=May 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
According to the Brazilian Civil Code and the Public Registries Act, the name registered after birth is definitive and immutable. However, there are some circumstances under which a name change is allowed: 
* If an obvious writing error is made while registering the name of the child.  
* In the first year after a person reaches the [[age of majority]] (18&amp;nbsp;years), they can request a change in their first names, but modification of surnames is not allowed.  
* If a person's name exposes them to ridicule and harms their everyday well-being.  
* If a person is recognized publicly by another name, they can request a name change or addition, by providing as support three testimonials of the change in name.  
* If a person has undergone a sex change, recent jurisprudence has allowed name modifications in most such cases.

===India===
In India, the person concerned submits a name change request to an appropriate authority, with supporting documents. Subsequently, an application must be made to the Government Printing Press, which issues an Official Gazette Notification certifying the change of name.&lt;ref&gt;http://goaprintingpress.gov.in/uploads/Change%20of%20Name%20and%20Surname%20Act.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}
Although it has always been relatively easy to change one's legal names in Norway, it used to require some kind of government approval. As late as 1830, local vicars were instructed to write both given (Christian) names, as well as last names, in the baptismal record. Earlier, only the given name of the child, birth date, baptismal date, and sex were written down, alongside the parents' names. It was not until the beginning of the 20th century, however, that the authorities required everyone to adopt a family surname. Until about 1980, the government still required that a name change applicant apply to the government regional representative (fylkesmann). The law has been replaced twice since then. Nowadays, the process is as easy as in common-law countries; the subject merely submits the names wanted (providing that the surname chosen is not in use or is not used by fewer than 200 persons) to the local authorities for the purposes of election rosters and census counts; there is no longer an application process.

===Philippines===
2001 RA 9048 amends Articles 376 and 412 of the [[Civil Code of the Philippines]], which prohibit the change of name or surname of a person, or any correction or change of entry in a civil register without a judicial order. Administrative Order No. 1 Series of 2001, implemented the law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/irr_ra9048.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621060551/http://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/irr_ra9048.html|date=June 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It authorizes the city or municipal civil registrar or the consul general to correct a clerical or typographical error in an entry or change the first name or nickname in the civil register without need of a judicial order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/primerra9048.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212183553/http://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/primerra9048.html|archivedate=February 12, 2012|website=census.gov.ph|title= Civil Registration – Primer for RA 9048}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno9048.htm|title=PHILIPPINE LAWS, STATUTES AND CODES – CHAN ROBLES VIRTUAL LAW LIBRARY|work=chanrobles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Name and gender change====
In case of controversial and substantial changes, [[Philippines]] [[jurisprudence]] requires full-blown court [[lawsuit]], that must include the local civil registrar in the petition, since RA 9048 and Rule 108 (Cancellation or correction of entries in the Civil Registry) of the Rules of Court do not allow the change of sex in a birth certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/rulesofcourtspecialproceedings.htm#RULE%20108|title=SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS|work=chanrobles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only landmark case in the Philippines on name and legal sex change is the Jeff Cagandahan case. The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] Justice [[Leonardo Quisumbing]] on September 12, 2008, allowed Cagandahan, 27, who has [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]], to change his [[birth certificate]] name from Jennifer to Jeff, and his legal gender from female to male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080917-161148/Call-him-Jeff-says-SC-he-used-to-be-called-Jennifer|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808193038/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080917-161148/Call-him-Jeff-says-SC-he-used-to-be-called-Jennifer|archivedate=August 8, 2014|title=Call him Jeff, says SC; he used to be called Jennifer|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,24359150-401,00.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216041937/http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,24359150-401,00.html|archivedate=February 16, 2009|title=Woman's body 'naturally' became male|work=[[News.com.au]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,423242,00.html|title=Rare Condition Turns Woman Into Man|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quebec===
Although as in other jurisdictions residents of [[Quebec]] may informally use whatever name they want, procedures for formal name change are very strict as Quebec (unlike the rest of Canada) operates under a [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system. The decision must be authorized by the Director of Civil Status, and requires a valid reason for changing the name, including long-term use of the new name (in the Montreuil case cited below, the Quebec appeals court has considered five years' use to be a sufficient reason), difficulty of use due to spelling or pronunciation, or bearing a name that another person has made infamous.

Only a judge may authorize a name change for a child for reasons of abandonment, deprivation of parental authority, or change in [[Paternity (law)|filiation]] such as [[adoption]].

This has occasionally led to controversy. A lawyer named Micheline Montreuil, a non-operative [[transgender]] woman, had to undergo a lengthy process to have her name legally changed. Initially, the director of civil status refused to permit the change on the grounds that a legal male could not bear a female name. According to Quebec law, Montreuil could not change her record of sex because this requires proof of a completed [[sex reassignment surgery]], which she has not had. On November 1, 1999, the provincial court of appeal ruled that nothing in the law prevented a person who was legally male from legally adopting a woman's name. (Montreuil was initially prevented from changing her name despite this ruling on the grounds that she had not established general use, as normally required for a name change; the Quebec appeals court finally authorized the change on November 7, 2002.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.micheline.ca/page034-batailles-e.htm#dictateur|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212004926/http://www.micheline.ca/page034-batailles-e.htm|archivedate=February 12, 2012|title=Micheline Anne Hélène Montreuil and his fights|website=micheline.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Director of Civil Status will amend a Quebec birth certificate if a name change certificate is issued by another province. Some have used that loophole by temporarily moving to one of Canada's other provinces, which follow the more permissive common-law rules, in order to get the legal documents.

===South Africa===
South Africa, which uses a mixture of common law and civil [[Roman Dutch law]], mostly uses common-law procedures with regard to name change. Name changes in [[South Africa]] are regulated by the Births and Deaths Registration Act (Act 51 of 1992, as amended). The personal information of all citizens and permanent residents is recorded on the Population Register, so any name changes must be registered.

A person can change their forenames by submitting a form to the [[South African Department of Home Affairs|Department of Home Affairs]]. An individual's surname, or that of a family, may be changed by applying to the Department and providing a "good and sufficient reason" for the change.

A married woman can change her surname to that of her husband or join her maiden name with her husband's surname, and a divorced woman may return to her previous surname, without applying or paying a fee; but she must notify the department so that the details in the Population Register can be changed. (It is possible that, if challenged, these provisions might be held to be unconstitutional because they apply only to women.)

South Africa has officially recognized same sex marriages since 2006 and in doing so now allows one or both partners to change their surnames in the marriage register on the day of the marriage. A new passport and ID book can then be applied for with the new married surname as well.

The surnames of minor children can also be changed under various circumstances involving the marriage, divorce or death of a parent, children born out of wedlock, and guardianship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.home-affairs.gov.za/personal_amendments.asp ''Personal Amendments.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911222143/http://www.home-affairs.gov.za/personal_amendments.asp |date=2008-09-11 }} (c. 1997). South African Department of Home Affairs. Retrieved May 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, a name change requires the approval of the respective [[Cantons of Switzerland|Cantonal]] government, if there are important reasons (''wichtige Gründe'' / ''justes motifs'') for the change, according to article 30 of the [[Swiss Civil Code]]. When aliens apply for naturalization, they have the option of asking for their names to be changed upon the grants of citizenship with no additional fees.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} According to the case law of the [[Swiss Federal Supreme Court]], such requests must be granted only if the petitioner shows that they suffer substantially from their present name, e.g., if it is the same as that of a notorious criminal.

===Taiwan===
{{Wikibooks|Annotated Republic of China Laws/Name Act}}
In [[Taiwan]], the government strictly regulates when one's surname, given name or both may or may not be changed, under the Name Act (姓名條例) since 1953 with 10 articles, totally amended into 14 articles in 2001, and the [[s:Enforcement Regulations of the Name Act|Enforcement Regulations of the Name Act]] (姓名條例施行細則).

Legally permitted reasons to change one's given name are:&lt;ref&gt;Article 6 of the Name Act (1953) ([[s:zh:姓名條例 (民國42年)|姓名條例 (民國42年)]]), amended into Article 7 of the Name Act (2001) ([[s:zh:姓名條例 (民國90年)|姓名條例 (民國90年)]]).&lt;/ref&gt;
#Having the same name when serving in an institution or studying in the same school.
#Since 1983, having the same name as one's parent, grandparent, or great-grandparent.&lt;ref&gt;Clause 2 of Article 6 of the Name Act (1983) ([[s:zh:姓名條例 (民國72年)|姓名條例 (民國72年)]]), amended into Clause 2 of Section 1 of Article 7 of the Name Act (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;
#Having the same name as someone else who lives in the same county or city and having lived there for at least 6 months.
#Having the same name as a wanted criminal, for example [[:zh:陳進興|陳進興 (Chén Jìnxīng)]], a common name used by not only a convicted kidnapper and murderer who was executed in Taiwan for major crimes in 1997 ([[:zh:陳進興 (台灣罪犯)]]) but also a Taiwanese statesman ([[:zh:陳進興 (台灣政治人物)]]).
#Having special reasons,&lt;ref&gt;Clause 6 of Section 1 of Article 7 of the Name Act (2001) effective 15 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; which is limited to twice in one's lifetime, while the second given name change of this type may not be done before reaching adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Section 2 of Article 7 of the Name Act (2001) effective 15 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name change on religious conversion==
{{further|Religious name}}
Adherents of various religions change their name upon [[Religious conversion|conversion]] or confirmation. The name adopted may not have any legal status but will represent their adopted religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Celia Emmelhainz, [http://works.bepress.com/emmelhainz/4/ ''Naming a New Self: Identity Elasticity and Self-Definition in Voluntary Name Changes.''] (c. 2012). Names, Vol. 60, Iss. 3. Retrieved April 4, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
* Individuals who attend a ceremony to officially become Buddhists are usually given a new "[[Dharma name]]", which marks their "[[Refuge (Buddhism)|taking refuge]]".

===Christianity===
* It has been historical Christian practice to adopt a name on [[baptism]] or (in some countries) [[confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/ce001006.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050428082432/http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/ce001006.htm|date=April 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The customary practice whereby persons entering a [[religious institute]] take on a [[name in religion]] is still observed by [[Eastern Orthodox]] and some traditional [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]]. Eastern Orthodox monastics are usually given the name of a prophet or a monastic saint.
* [[Pope]]s take a [[papal name]] upon their accession to office; for example, [[Jorge M. Bergoglio]] adopted the name [[Francis (given name)|Francis]].

===Hinduism===
There is no formal concept of conversion in Hinduism but converts to Hinduism are accepted, usually after a small ceremony called [[Shuddhi|Shudhikaran]] (purification). Individuals who attend a Shudhikaran ceremony to officially become [[Hindu]] may be optionally given a new [[Dharma]] (religious) name, which is usually based on [[Sanskrit]] or [[Indian name]] such as names based on [[Hindu deities]].

===Islam===
* Converts to Islamic faith may choose a new name; although it is not required, it may in some cases be preferable for personal reasons or because the name is of uncertain Islamicity (e.g. the person converting has a [[theophoric name]] in another religion, such as Christopher or Ganesh). Boxer Cassius Clay's adoption of the name [[Muhammad Ali]] is a well-known example, as is Cat Stevens' change to [[Yusuf Islam]] and Malcolm Little's adoption of the name [[Malcolm X]] and later ''El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz''.  On the other hand, converts may choose to keep their names, as did [[Dave Chappelle]].
*Women do not normally take their husbands' surnames as their own. Their maiden name continues to be their surname even after marriage. Sometimes their husbands first name becomes their surname, similar to the case of surname chains indicating someone's chain of fathers. 
* In Islamic tradition, there are two kinds of [[surname]].
:# The first kind comes from the father's first name, which means that the particular person is the child of. For example, a name such as ''ibn Abdullah'' means "son of Abdullah", or ''bint Abdullah'' means "daughter of Abdullah". Father descendant names can be chained, meaning that an individual can have the name of their father, followed by their paternal grandfather, followed by the father of that grandfather, to indicate a patrilineal lineage.
:# The second kind is associated with [[clan]], [[tribal]] or [[ethnic]] affiliation and is also solely dependant on the person's patrilineal line. In Islamic family law, the individual is required to keep the clan, tribal or ethnic affiliation of their father where it is known, whether the child be illegitimate, staying with their mother after divorce or adopted.
The last name cannot be changed in such a way as to reflect a heritage that is not that of one's biological father.

===Judaism===
* Jewish people in the Diaspora sometimes give their children two names: a secular name for everyday use and a Hebrew name for religious purposes.  [[Conversion to Judaism|Converts to Judaism]] choose a Hebrew name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judaism.about.com/library/3_lifecycles/names/bl_names.htm|title=Choosing a Hebrew Name – Naming a Jewish Baby|author=Ariela Pelaia|work=About.com Religion &amp; Spirituality}}&lt;/ref&gt; Full Jewish names include a [[patronym]]: converts take the patronym "ben/bat Avraham Avinu" (son/daughter of Our Father Abraham) as converts are held to be spiritual descendants of [[Abraham]], the forebear of Jews.

===Sikhism===
* Those in the [[Sikh]] faith adopt a new last name upon baptism into the [[Khalsa]]. Men adopt the last name [[Singh]], while women adopt the last name [[Kaur]].
* The Sikhs adopted the name Singh in 1699 during the Birth of the Khalsa.

===Wicca===
* Some wiccans have a [[Craft name]] that is used during coven gatherings and rituals.

According to the legend, a group of settlers led by a figure named Nunong Karugtong crossed the Sierra Madre Mountains from somewhere in what is now Rizal Province in search of better living conditions.  After examining multiple sites in what is now the Municipality of Infanta, they eventually settled on a site near the Bantilan River, where the discovery of a huge Yam root convinced them that the site was ideal for settlement.  This eventually became the site of the settlement which European colonizers would call "Binangonan de Lampon," which in turn would evolve into the Municipality of Infanta.&lt;ref name="infantagov"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4226">A '''patrial name''' or '''geographical surname''' is a surname or second [[cognomen]] given to person deriving from a [[toponym]], the name for a geographical place. It was particularly common in ancient Greece and Rome.&lt;ref&gt;The New Century classical handbook Catherine B. Avery - 1962 "Toponyms (place names) also appear: Coriolanus, Norbanus, Sabinus, Soranus, Tusculanus.&lt;/ref&gt;
The lack of a family [[surname]] and use of a geographical cognomen as a surname may the sign of a lower class, such as courtesans when signing a contract.&lt;ref&gt;Molière: A Theatrical Life - Page 42 Virginia Scott - 2002 "Taviani identifies Lucrezia as a courtesan because of her name that, in the fashion of courtesans, joins a Roman first name to a geographical surname and because the contract was signed in a house owned or leased by her at a time when  "&lt;/ref&gt; With medieval writers, Christian, Jewish and Muslim, whose works circulated around many countries, geographical cognomens sometimes served to distinguish better than "son of," "ben" or "ibn." 

Roman Military commanders often took a second cognomen, an [[agnomen]], recalling a victorious campaign: Africanus, Asiaticus, Macedonicus, Numantinus. These may be inherited as in the case of [[Augustus]] who inherited the cognomen Thurinus.

==Formation==
Examples in formation of patrial names include:

1. definite article and noun - using a [[demonym]] (also called [[gentile name]] or [[gentilic]], from Latin ''[[nomen gentile]]'' or ''[[gentilicium]]'')
* [[Athenagoras of Athens|Athenagoras the Athenian]] (''Athenagoras o Athenaios,'' Ἀθηναγόρας ὁ Ἀθηναῖος).
* [[Saul of Tarsus]] "Saul the Tarsian" (''Saulos o Tarseus'', Σαῦλος [ὁ] Ταρσεύς)
* [[Lucius of Cyrene|Lucius the Cyrenian]] (''Loukios o Kurenaios'' Λούκιος ὁ Κυρηναῖος)
* [[Trophimus]] "called the Ephesian" (''Trofimos o Efesios'', Τρόφιμος ὁ Ἐφέσιος)
* [[Ibn Muʿādh al-Jayyānī|Ibn Muadh al-Jayyani]] (989-1079) "al Jayyani", the man of [[Jaén, Spain|Jaén]]
* [[Isaac Alfasi]] (1013-1103) "al Fasi", the man of [[Fez, Morocco]]

2. unclear: indefinite noun / adjectival forms
* [[Mary Magdalene]], "Mary of [[Magdala]]" (Greek ''Maria Magadelene,'' Μαρία Μαγδαληνή).
 
3. adjectives - a common Latin method for making a [[toponym]]ic adjective is to add -[i]ensis
* [[Giraldus Cambrensis]] "Gerald of [[Wales]]"
* [[Galfridus Monemutensis]], "Geoffrey of [[Monmouth]]"

4. genitive "of" constructions
* [[Jacopo da Bologna]] "Jacob of [[Bologna]]"
* [[Jacques de Vitry]] "James of [[Vitry-sur-Seine]]"

In examples 1 through 3, where the noun or adjective has case [[declension]] the partial name will typically decline in accordance with normal noun or adjective rules. For example, in ''Giraldi Cambrensis opera'' - "the works of [genitive] Gerald of Wales" - ''Giraldus'' declines to ''Giraldi'' (the genitive form of Gerald) and ''cambrensis'' (nominative adjective) declines to ''cambrensis'' (genitive adjective, but the same as nominative in this example). The declension is normally not followed when citing Latin patrial names in English, "of Giraldus Cambrensis," but may cause confusion when trying to identify the nominative spellings of patrial names from Latin or Greek sources.

==Modern era examples==
Modern era examples in Europe are generally limited to nicknames, or deliberate choices of a birthplace as a penname or stagename or change of name by deed poll:
* [[Bela Lugosi]] stagename "from [[Lugoj]]"&lt;ref&gt;Transylvania: Birthplace of Vampires - Page 32 Robert Z. Cohen - 2011  This onscreen Dracula was the creation of Transylvanian-Hungarian actor Bela Lugosi. Born Béla Blaskó in the western Transylvanian city of Lugoj (his stage name means “from Lugoj” in Hungarian&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[George Brassaï]] pseudonym "from [[Braşov]]"&lt;ref&gt;European culture: a contemporary companion Jonathan Law - 1993 "His professional name means 'from Brasso', his birthplace. After studying in Budapest and Berlin he moved to Paris in 1924, where he worked as a journalist; he did not take his first photograph until the age of 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''people''' is a plurality of [[person]]s considered as a whole, as is the case with an [[ethnic group]] or [[nation]]. Collectively, for example, the contemporary [[Frisians]] and [[Danes]] are two related [[Germanic peoples]], while various [[Middle East]]ern ethnic groups are often linguistically categorized as [[Semitic people]]s.

{{Main article|Commoner}}
[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' by [[Eugène Delacroix]]]]

Various [[sovereign state|states]] govern, or claim to govern, in the name of ''the people''. Both the [[Roman Republic]] and the [[Roman Empire]] used the [[Latin]] term ''[[SPQR|Senatus Populusque Romanus]]'', (the Senate and People of Rome). This term was fixed to Roman legionary standards, and even after the [[Roman Emperor]]s achieved a state of total personal [[autarchy]], they continued to wield their power in the name of the Senate and People of Rome.

A [[People's Republic]] is typically a [[Marxism|Marxist]] or [[Socialism|socialist]] [[one-party state]] that claims to govern on behalf of the people even if it in practice often turns out to be a [[dictatorship]]. [[Populism]] is another umbrella term for various political tendencies that claim to represent the people, usually with an implication that they serve the ''common people'' instead of the [[Elitism|elite]].

Chapter One, Article One of the [[Charter of the United Nations]] states that peoples have the right to [[self-determination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter1.shtml |title=Charter of the United Nations: Chapter I: Purposes and Principles |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=22 April 2013 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6YNQicd2P?url=http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter1.shtml |archive-date=8 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In law ==
{{further information|Popular sovereignty}}
In [[criminal law]], in certain jurisdictions, criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of ''the People''. Several U.S. states, including [[California]], [[Illinois]], and [[New York (state)|New York]], use this style.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''[[People v. Anderson|California v. Anderson]]'' 6 Cal. 3d 628; 493 P.2d 880; 100 Cal. Rptr. 152; 1972 Cal. LEXIS 154 (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; Citations outside the jurisdictions in question usually substitute the name of the state for the words "the People" in the case captions.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, ''[[Bluebook|The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation]]'', rule 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Four states&amp;nbsp;— [[Massachusetts]], [[Virginia]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Kentucky]]&amp;nbsp;— refer to themselves as ''the [[Commonwealth]]'' in case captions and legal process.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Commonwealth (United States)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Other states, such as [[Indiana]], typically refer to themselves as ''the State'' in case captions and legal process. Outside the United States, criminal trials in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[Philippines]] are prosecuted in the name of the people of their respective states.

The political theory underlying this format is that criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the [[sovereignty|sovereign]]; thus, in these [[U.S. states]], the "people" are judged to be the sovereign, even as in the [[United Kingdom]] and other dependencies of the [[British monarchy|British Crown]], criminal prosecutions are typically brought in the name of [[the Crown]]. "The people" identifies the entire body of the [[citizen]]s of a jurisdiction invested with political power or gathered for political purposes.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'', 5th ed., "People".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Presidential Standard of Pakistan (1956-1967).svg|thumb|right|200px|Presidential Standard (1956-1967)]]

The '''Presidential Standard of Pakistan''' is the official flag of the [[President of Pakistan]].

== Design ==

The Presidential Standard consists of the background of the [[Flag of Pakistan]] with the gold Presidential Crest replacing the white crescent and star found in the Flag of Pakistan. The Presidential Crest consists of a smaller crescent and star flanked by wheat branches with the words "Pakistan" written in Urdu underneath.

== Use ==

The Presidential Standard is displayed only in the presence of the President of Pakistan, particularly in the office and official residence of the President of Pakistan. It is always displayed alongside the Flag of Pakistan. It is also flown alongside the Flag of Pakistan in the Presidential motorcade. The Presidential Standard is never flown atop any building.

== History ==

The Presidential Standard was first adopted in 1956 and has since been redesigned twice: in 1974 and 1998.

'''Prophets in Islam''' ({{lang-ar|الأنبياء في الإسلام}}) include "messengers" (''rasul'', pl. ''rusul''), bringers of a [[Revelation|divine revelation]] via an angel (Arabic: {{lang|ar|ملائكة}}, [[Islamic view of angels|malāʾikah]]);&lt;ref name=campo-2009-559/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shaatri, A. I. 2007"&gt;Shaatri, A. I. (2007). Nayl al Rajaa' bisharh' Safinat an'najaa'. Dar Al Minhaj.&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Prophet#Islam|prophet]]s" (''nabī'', pl. ''anbiyāʼ''), lawbringers that [[Muslim]]s believe were sent by [[God in Islam|God]] to every person, bringing God's message in a language they can understand.&lt;ref name=campo-2009-559&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campo|first1=Juan Eduardo|title=Encyclopedia of Islam|date=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9780816054541|pages=559–560|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZbyz_Hr-eIC&amp;pg=PA559&amp;dq=prophethood+in+islam+encyclopedia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pTKIVduAEobuoAS0-Yi4Ag&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=prophethood%20in%20islam%20encyclopedia&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|30|47|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge of the Islamic prophets is one of the [[Iman (concept)#The_Six_Articles_of_Faith|six articles of the Islamic faith]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/beliefs/beliefs.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Islam: Basic articles of faith|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180813005904/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/beliefs/beliefs.shtml|archive-date=13 August 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and specifically mentioned in the [[Quran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{quran-usc|2|285|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims believe that the first prophet was also the first human being, [[Adam]] ([[Adam in Islam|ادم]]), created by Allah (الله). Many of the revelations delivered by the 48 [[prophets in Judaism]] and many [[prophets of Christianity]] are mentioned as such in the Quran but usually in slightly different forms. For example, the Jewish [[Elisha]] is called [[Elisha#In Islam|Eliyas]], [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] is [[Job in Islam|Ayyub]], [[Jesus]] is [[Jesus in Islam|Isa]], etc. The [[Torah]] given to [[Moses]] ([[Moses in Islam|Musa]]) is called ''[[Torah in Islam|Tawrat]]'', the [[Psalms]] given to [[David]] ([[David in Islam|Dawud]]) is the ''[[Zabur]]'', the [[The gospel|Gospel]] given to Jesus is ''[[Gospel in Islam|Injil]]''.&lt;ref name=campo-2009-559/&gt;

Unique to Islam is [[Muhammad]] ([[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad ibn ʿAbdullāh]]), who Muslims believe is the "Seal of the Prophets" (''[[Khatam an-Nabiyyin]]'', i.e. the last prophet); and the [[Quran]], revealed to Muhammad but not written down by him,&lt;ref name=denffer&gt;{{cite book|last=Denffer|first=Ahmad von|title=Ulum al-Qur'an : an introduction to the sciences of the Qur an|year=1985|publisher=Islamic Foundation|isbn=0860371328|pages=37|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Muslims believe is unique among divine revelations as the only correct one protected by [[God in Islam|God]] from distortion or corruption,&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding the Qurán'' - Page xii, Ahmad Hussein Sakr - 2000&lt;/ref&gt; destined to remain in its true form until the [[End time|Last Day]].&lt;ref name="The Qur'an Surah 15:9"&gt;{{Cite quran|15|9|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims believe Muhammad to be the last prophet, although after the prophets there are still [[Wali|saints]]&lt;ref&gt;Neal Robinson ''Christ in Islam and Christianity'' SUNY Press 1990 {{ISBN|978-0-791-40558-1}} page 58&lt;/ref&gt; (though some modern schools, such as [[Salafism]] and [[Wahhabism]], reject the theory of sainthood&lt;ref&gt;Radtke, B., Lory, P., Zarcone, Th., DeWeese, D., Gaborieau, M., F. M. Denny, Françoise Aubin, J. O. Hunwick and N. Mchugh, "Walī", in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C. E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W. P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt;).

In Muslim belief, every prophet in Islam preached the same main Islamic beliefs, the [[Tawhid|Oneness of God]], worshipping of that one God, avoidance of [[Shirk (Islam)|idolatry]] and [[Islamic views on sin|sin]], and the belief in the [[Islamic eschatology|Day of Resurrection]] or the [[Last Judgment|Day of Judgement]] and life after death. Each came to preach Islam at different times in history and some told of the coming of the final ''Islamic prophet and messenger'' of [[God in Islam|God]], who would be named "[[Ahmad|Ahmed]] and Muhammad". 

This narrative is found in "Chapter of the Ranks", Qur'an, 61:6 as Allah asked Jesus to remind the Children of Israel but they accused him of the prophecy:

&lt;big&gt;وَإِذْ قَالَ عِيسَى ٱبْنُ مَرْيَمَ يَـٰبَنِى إِسْرَٰعِيلَ إِنِّى رَسُولُ ٱللهِ إِلَيْكُم مُّصَدِقًا لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَىَّ مِنَ ٱلتَّوْرىٰةِ وَمُبَشِّرًا بِرَسُولٍ يَأْتِى مِن بَعْدِى ٱسْمُهُ أَحْمَدُ فَلَمَّا جَآءَهُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَـٰتِ قَالُواْ هَـٰذَا سِحْرٌ مُّبينٌ&lt;/big&gt;  

''wa-idh qāla ‘Īsā ’b·nu Maryama: "yā Banī Israā‘īla innī Rasūlu ’llāhi ilay-kum muṣaddiqal li-mā bayna yadayya mina ’t-Tawraāti wa-mubash·shiram bi-Rasūlin ya’tī mim ba‘dī ’s·mu-huū Aḥmadu, fa-lammā jaā’a-hum bi’l-bayyināti, qālū "hādhā siḥrum mubīn!"''

{{quote|&lt;nowiki&gt;And remember, Jesus, the son of Mary, said: "O Children of Israel! I am the messenger of Allah (sent) to you, confirming the Law [=Torah] (which came) before me, and giving Glad Tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad." But when he came to them with Clear Signs, they said, "this is evident sorcery!"&lt;/nowiki&gt;|Quran, sura 61 (As-Saf), ''[[ayah]]'' 6|source=}}

== Etymology ==
In Arabic and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]],&lt;ref&gt;The Hebrew root [[Nun (letter)|nun]]-[[Bet (letter)|vet]]-[[Aleph|alef]] ("navi") is based on the two-letter root nun-vet which denotes hollowness or openness; to receive transcendental wisdom, one must make oneself "open". Cf. [[Rashbam]]'s comment to {{Bibleverse||Genesis|20:7|105}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term ''nabī'' (Arabic plural form: &lt;big&gt;أَنْبِيَاء&lt;/big&gt; ''anbiyāʼ'') means "prophet". Forms of this noun occur 75 times in the Quran. The term ''[[nubuwwah]]'' ([[Arabic]]: &lt;big&gt;نُبُوَّة&lt;/big&gt; meaning "prophethood") occurs five times in the Quran. The terms ''rasūl'' ([[Arabic]] plural: &lt;big&gt;رُسُل&lt;/big&gt; ''rusul'') and  ''mursal'' ([[Arabic|ِArabic]] singular: &lt;big&gt;مُرْسَل&lt;/big&gt; ''mursal''; plural: &lt;big&gt;مُرْسَلُون&lt;/big&gt; ''mursalūn'') denote "messenger with law given/ received by GOD" and occur more than 300 times. The term for a prophetic "message" ([[Arabic|ِArabic]] singular: &lt;big&gt;رِسَالَة&lt;/big&gt; ''risālah''; plural: &lt;big&gt;رِسَالَات&lt;/big&gt; ''risālāt''), appears in the [[Quran]] in ten instances.&lt;ref name="EoQP"&gt;Uri Rubin, "Prophets and Prophethood", ''[[Encyclopedia of the Qur'an]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Syriac language|Syriac form]] of ''rasūl Allāh'' (literally: "messenger of God"), ''s̲h̲eliḥeh d-allāhā'', occurs frequently in the [[New Testament apocrypha|apocryphal]] ''[[Acts of Thomas|Acts of St. Thomas]]''. The corresponding verb for ''s̲h̲eliḥeh''—''s̲h̲alaḥ'', occurs in connection with the prophets in the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|3:13-14|1000}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Exodus|4:13|1000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Isaiah|6:8|1000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Jeremiah|1:7|1000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EoI"&gt;A. J. Wensinck, "Rasul", ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The words "prophet" (Arabic: {{lang|ar|نبي}} {{transl|ar|''nabī''}}) and "messenger" (Arabic: {{lang|ar|رسول}} {{transl|ar|''rasūl''}}) appear several times in the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]].

In the Hebrew Bible, the word ''[[Nevi'im|nabi]]'' ("spokesperson, prophet") occurs more commonly, and the Hebrew word ''mal'akh'' ("messenger") refers to [[Angels in Judaism]]. According to Judaism, [[Haggai]], [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zaqariah]], and [[Malachi]] were the last prophets, all of whom lived at the end of the 70-year [[Babylonian exile]]. With them, the authentic period of ''[[Prophecy#Judaism|Nevuah]]'' ("prophecy") died,&lt;ref&gt;According to the [[Vilna Gaon]], based on the opinion that [[Nechemyah]] died in Babylon before 9th Tevet 3448 (313 BCE). Nechemya was governor of [[Yehud Medinata|Persian Judea]] under [[Artaxerxes I of Persia]] in the 5th century BCE. The [[Book of Nehemiah]] describes his work in rebuilding Jerusalem during the [[Second Temple period]]. {{Cite journal | title = Babylonian Talmud | first = Vilna |last=Gaon |authorlink=Vilna Gaon| volume = San.11a, Yom.9a/Yuch.1.14/Kuz.3.39,65,67/Yuch.1/Mag.Av.O.C.580.6 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nowadays only the "[[Bath Kol]]" (בת קול, lit. ''daughter of a voice'', "voice of God") exists ([[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] 11a).

In the New Testament, however, the word "messenger" becomes more frequent, sometimes in association with the concept of a prophet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] {{bibleverse-nb||Hebrews|3:1|1000}}; [[Gospel of John|John]] {{bibleverse-nb||John|17:3|1000}}; [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|11:10|1000}}; [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|1:2|1000}}; [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] {{bibleverse-nb||Ephesians|3:5|1000}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Ephesians|4:11|1000}}; [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] {{bibleverse-nb||1Corinthians|28:12|1000}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Messenger" may refer to Jesus, to his [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] and to John the Baptist. But the last book of the Old Testament, the [[Book of Malachi]], speaks of a messenger that Christian commentators interpret as a reference to the future prophet [[John the Baptist]] (Yahya).&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Barnes (theologian)|Albert Barnes]] under {{bibleverse||Malachi|2:7|1000}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Malachi|3:1|1000}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
{{Religious text primary|section|date=June 2018}}
In Muslim belief, every Islamic prophet preached Islam. The beliefs of [[Charity (practice)|charity]], prayer, pilgrimage, worship of God and fasting are believed to have been taught by every prophet who has ever lived.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The Quran itself calls Islam the "religion of [[Abraham]]" ([[Abraham in Islam|Ibrahim]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|67|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to [[Jacob]] ([[Jacob in Islam|Yaqub]]) and the [[Israelites|Twelve Tribes of Israel]] as being Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|2|123|e=133|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran says
{{quote|The same religion has He established for you as that which He enjoined on Noah—the which We have sent by inspiration to thee—and that which We enjoined on Abraham, Moses, and Jesus: Namely, that ye should remain steadfast in religion, and make no divisions therein:...|Quran, sura 42 ([[Ash-Shura]]), ayah 13&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|42|13|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Status ===
Islam teaches that prophets were "protected from sin" by God, so unlike lesser human beings they cannot commit a sin.&lt;ref name="Auda-2016"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Auda |first1=Jasser |title=Were Prophets and Companions Infallible? |url=http://aboutislam.net/counseling/ask-about-islam/prophets-companions-infallible/ |website=About Islam |accessdate=8 July 2018 |date=Nov 17, 2016 |quote=Regarding the issue of the prophets being sinless or infallible, there is an agreement among scholars that prophets are protected from sins. The protection of all prophets from sins is an Islamic belief, which is a precondition to trusting the prophets’ message and following their example.
However, there is a debate among scholars on whether prophets (peace be upon them all) are subject to error in judgments in “human” matters. The word `issmah (literally: protection) is mentioned in the Quran in the context of the Prophet being protected from people’s whims and Satan’s delusions while he conveys the message of God.
However, the Quran did correct Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) on a few occasions in matters of human judgment (Quran 8:67; 9:43; and 80:1-3).
Nevertheless, some scholars rejected the possibility of erring in any prophetic decision whatsoever (for example, Al-Amedi, Al-Ihkaam fi Usul Al-Ahkam, vol.4, p. 99, Dar Al-Kitab Al-Arabi, Beirut, AH 1404}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IQA"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Saalih al-Munajjid |first1=Muhammad |title=248875: Infallibility of the Prophets |url=https://islamqa.info/en/248875 |website=Islam Question and Answer |accessdate=8 July 2018 |date=4 January 2017 |quote=The Prophets were infallible in conveying the message from Allah, may He be exalted, so their words could not be but true and they did not make any mistake, whether deliberate or otherwise, in conveying the message.  They were also infallible and protected from committing major sins such as zina (adultery) and theft.  They were also infallible and protected from committing minor sins that are indicative of baseness, such as stealing a morsel of food or giving short measure.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran speaks of the ''Islamic prophets'' as being the greatest human beings of all time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Wheeler, ''Historical Dictionary of Prophets in Islam and Judaism'', "Prophets"&lt;/ref&gt; A prophet, in the Muslim sense of the term, is a person whom God specially chose to teach the faith of Islam.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Some were called to prophesy late in life, in Muhammad's case at the age of 40.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, ''Historical Dictionary of Prophets in Islam and Judaism'', "Noah"&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as John the Baptist, were called to prophesy while still at a young age and Jesus prophesied while still in his cradle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|19|30|e=33|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Quran verse 4:69 lists various virtuous groups of human beings, among whom prophets (including messengers) occupy the highest rank. Verse 4:69 reads:&lt;ref name="EoQP"/&gt;

{{quote|All who obey [[Allah]] and the messenger are in the company of those on whom is the Grace of Allah—of the prophets (who teach), the sincere (lovers of Truth), the witnesses (who testify), and the Righteous (who do good): Ah! what a beautiful fellowship!|Quran, sura 4 (An-Nisa), ''[[ayah]]'' 69&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|4|69|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Biblical stories retold in the Quran in the Arabic language (e.g., Job, Moses, [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]] ([[Joseph in Islam|Yusuf]]) etc.) certainly differ from the Jewish [[Hebrew Bible]], the [[Greek Old Testament]] and the Greek [[New Testament]], in that the Quran always demonstrates that it is "God's practice" (''[[sunnat Allah]]'') to make faith triumph finally over the forces of evil and adversity. "We have made the [[Shaitan|evil ones]] friends to those without faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|7|27|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Assuredly God will defend those who believe."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|22|49|e=133|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eoi-84&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosskeen Gibb,|first1=Hamilton Alexander|last2=Pellat|first2=Charles|last3=Schacht|first3=Joseph|last4=Lewis,|first4=Bernard|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam|date=1973|publisher=Brill|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus the [[Islamic view of Jesus' death|Islamic Isa]] did not die on the cross like the Christian thought about Jesus, but deceived his enemies and ascended to heaven.

The prophets and messengers "share no divine attributes", and possess "no knowledge or power" other than that granted to them by God.&lt;ref name=EHHoF&gt;{{cite book|last1=Al-Amriki|first1=Yusuf Talal Ali|last2=Ullah|first2=Qazi Thanaa|title=Essential Hanafi Handbook of Fiqh|date=1985|publisher=Kazi Publications|location=Lahore, Pakistan|pages=23–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Numbers ===
Muslims believe that many prophets existed, including many not mentioned in the Quran. The Quran states: "There is a Messenger for every community"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Quran|10|47|t=[[Muhammad Abdel-Haleem|Muhammad A. S.

But Abu’l-Faraj ibn al-Jazwi disagreed with him and included this hadeeth in his book ''al-Mawdoo‘aat'' (the fabricated hadeeths) and accused Ibraaheem ibn Hishaam of fabricating the hadeeth. There is no doubt that more than one of the imams of ''al-jarh wa’t-ta‘deel'' (evaluation of hadeeth narrators) criticised him because of this hadeeth. "&lt;/ref&gt; and Shu'ayb al-Arna'oot&lt;ref&gt;''Tahqeeq Saheeh Ibn Hibbaan'', 2/79, "Shu‘ayb al-Arna’oot said: Its ''isnaad'' is ''da‘eef jiddan'' (very weak) – and he quoted the comments of the scholars about Ibraaheem ibn Hishaam."&lt;/ref&gt; the narration is weak, if not fabricated.

=== Female prophets ===
Most mainstream [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] scholars agree that prophets were males only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = There were no female prophets - Islam web - English|url = http://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/index.php?page=showfatwa&amp;Option=FatwaId&amp;Id=31788|website = www.islamweb.net|accessdate = 2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2018}} Still, some like [[Ibn Hazm]], [[Al-Qurtubi|Qartubi]], [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajir]], and [[Ash'ari|al Ash‘ari]] thought that the verses that mention angels speaking to Mary are proofs of her prophethood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Surat 'Ali `Imran [3:42] - The Noble Qur'an - القرآن الكريم|url = http://legacy.quran.com/3/42|website = legacy.quran.com|accessdate = 2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://islamqa.info/en/158044&lt;nowiki/&gt;With regard to Prophethood, some of the scholars – such as Abu’l-Hasan al-Ash‘ari, al-Qurtubi and Ibn Hazm – were of the view that there were some female Prophets! including Maryam bint ‘Imraan. Their evidence is the verses in which it says that Allah, may He be exalted, sent revelation to the mother of Moosa, for example, and what it says about the angels speaking to Maryam (peace be upon her), and also what it says about Allah, may He be exalted, having chosen her above the women of the world.
&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2018}}  Also, [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajir]] interprets the Hadith "Many among men attained perfection but among women none attained the perfection except Mary, the daughter of `Imran; and Asiya, the wife of Pharaoh." He said perfection is prophethood, hence his claim that Mary and [[Asiya]] were prophets.&lt;ref&gt;http://islamqa.info/en/7181&lt;nowiki/&gt;The scholars differed as to the meaning of the perfection of women. Some said, it refers to Prophethood.

Ibn Hajar said in "''al-Fath''":

"… it is as if he said: No women attained Prophethood except for So and so and So and so." (''al-Fath'', 6/447).
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scriptures and other gifts ==

=== Holy books ===
{{See also|Islamic holy books}}
The revealed books are the records which Muslims believe were dictated by God to various Islamic prophets throughout the history of mankind, all these books promulgated the code and laws of Islam. The belief in all the revealed books is an [[Creed#Islamic creed|article of faith]] in Islam and Muslims must believe in all the scriptures to be a Muslim. Muslims believe the Quran, the final holy scripture, was sent because all the previous holy books had been either [[Tahrif|corrupted]] or lost.&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Encyclopedia of Islam'', Cyril Glasse, "Holy Books"&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Islam speaks of respecting all the previous scriptures, even in their current forms.&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Encyclopedia of Islam'', Cyril Glasse{{page needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran mentions some Islamic scriptures by name, which came before the Quran:
* ''[[Torah in Islam|Tawrat]]'' ([[Torah]]): According to the Quran, the Tawrat (Torah) was revealed to Moses,&lt;ref name="Q5336"&gt;{{Cite quran|53|36|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Muslims believe that the current Pentateuch, although it retains the main message,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|87|18|e=19|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; has suffered corruption over the years. Moses and his brother Haroon ([[Aaron]]) used the Torah to preach the message to the Children of Israel. The Quran implies that the Torah is the longest-used scripture, with the [[Jews|Jewish]] people still using the Torah today, and that all the [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] prophets would warn the people of any corruptions that were in the scripture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|5|44|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus, in Muslim belief, was the last prophet to be taught the [[Law of Moses|Mosaic Law]] in its true form.
* ''[[Zabur]]'' ([[Psalms]]): The Quran mentions the Psalms as being the holy scripture revealed to David. Scholars have often understood the Psalms to have been holy songs of praise.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', "Psalms"&lt;/ref&gt; The current Psalms are still praised by many Muslim scholars,&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah Yusuf Ali, ''Holy Quran: Text, Translation and Commentary''{{page needed|date=January 2015}}; Martin Lings, ''Mecca''{{page needed|date=January 2015}}; Abdul Malik, ''In Thy Seed''{{page needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Muslims generally assume that some of the current Psalms were written later and are not divinely revealed.
* Book of Enlightenment ([[Arabic]]: &lt;big&gt;كِتَابُ ٱلْمُنِير&lt;/big&gt; ''Kitābu ’l-Munīr''): The Quran mentions a ''Book of Enlightenment'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|184|s=ns}} and {{Cite quran|35|25|s=ns|b=n}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has alternatively been translated as ''Scripture of Enlightenment'' or the ''Illuminating Book''. It mentions that some prophets, in the past, came with clear signs from God as well as this particular scripture.
* Books of Divine Wisdom ([[Arabic]]: possibly identified as &lt;big&gt;الْزُبُر&lt;/big&gt; ''az-Zubur''): The Quran mentions certain ''Books of Divine Wisdom'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|184|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; translated by some scholars as ''Books of Dark Prophecies'', which are a reference to particular books vouchsafed to some prophets, wherein there was wisdom for man. Some scholars have suggested that these may be one and the same as the Psalms as their root Arabic word, ''Zubur'' (Quran 35:25) - the plural for the word "Scriptures", comes from the same source as the Arabic ''Zabur'' for the Psalms.
* ''[[Gospel in Islam|İnjil]]'' ([[Gospel]]): The İnjil (Gospel) was the holy book revealed to Jesus, according to the Quran. Although many lay Muslims believe the ''Injil'' refers to the entire New Testament, scholars have clearly pointed out that it refers not to the New Testament but to an original Gospel, which was sent by God, and was given to Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah Yusuf Ali, ''Holy Quran: Text, Translation and Commentary'', Appendix: "On the Injil"&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, according to Muslim belief, the Gospel was the message that Jesus, being divinely inspired, preached to the Children of Israel. The current [[Development of the New Testament canon|canonical Gospels]], in the belief of Muslim scholars, are not divinely revealed but rather are documents of the life of Jesus, as written by various contemporaries, disciples and companions. These Gospels contain portions of Jesus's teachings but do not represent the original Gospel, which was a single book written not by a human but was sent by God.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', "Injil"&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Scrolls of Abraham]]: ([[Arabic]]: الْصُّحُفِ ٱلْأُولَى ''aṣ-Ṣuḥufi ’l-Ūlā'' - "Books of the Earliest Revelation" and/or [[Arabic]]: الْصُّحُفِ إِبْرَهِيم ''aṣ-Ṣuḥufi ’Ibrahīm'') The Scrolls of Abraham are believed to have been one of the earliest bodies of scripture, which were vouchsafed to Abraham,&lt;ref name="quran8719"&gt;{{Cite quran|87|19|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later used by Ishmael and Isaac. Although usually referred to as 'scrolls/ manuscript', many translators have translated the Arabic ''Suhuf'' as 'the Scriptures'.&lt;ref&gt;Marmaduke Pickthall, ''The Meaning of the Glorious Quran''{{page needed|date=January 2015}}; Abdullah Yusuf Ali, ''The Holy Quran: Text, Translation and Commentary''{{page needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Scrolls of Abraham are now considered lost rather than corrupted, although some scholars{{who ?|date=May 2018}} have identified them with the [[Testament of Abraham]], an [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic piece of literature]] available in Arabic at the time of Muhammad{{source needed|date=May 2018}}. The verse mentioning the "Scriptures" is in Quran 87:18-19 where they are referred to "Books of the Earliest Revelation".
* [[Scrolls of Moses]]: ([[Arabic]]: الْصُّحُفِ ٱلْأُولَى ''aṣ-Ṣuḥufi ’l-Ūlā'' - "Books of the Earliest Revelation" and/or [[Arabic]]: الْصُّحُفِ مُوسَى ''aṣ-Ṣuḥufi ’l-Mūsā'') These scrolls, containing the revelations of Moses, which were perhaps written down later by Moses, Aaron and [[Joshua]], are understood by Muslims to refer not to the Torah but to revelations aside from the Torah. Some scholars have stated that they could possibly refer to the [[Book of the Wars of the Lord]],&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah Yusuf Ali, ''The Holy Quran: Text, Translation and Commentary''{{page needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a lost text spoken of in the Hebrew Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers 21:14&lt;/ref&gt; The verse mentioning the "Scriptures" is in Quran 87:18-19 where they are referred to "Books of the Earliest Revelation".

=== Holy gifts ===
{{Religious text primary|section|date=June 2011}}
The Quran mentions various divinely-bestowed gifts given to various prophets. These may be interpreted as books or forms of celestial knowledge. Although all prophets are believed by Muslims to have been immensely gifted, special mention of "wisdom" or "knowledge" for a particular prophet is understood to mean that some secret knowledge was revealed to him. The Quran mentions that Abraham prayed for wisdom and later received it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|26|83|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also mentions that Joseph&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|10|22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Moses&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|28|14|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; both attained wisdom when they reached full age; David received wisdom with kingship, after slaying [[Goliath]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|2|251|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]] ([[Lot in Islam|Lut]] received wisdom whilst prophesying in [[Sodom and Gomorrah]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|21|74|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; John the Baptist received wisdom while still a mere youth;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|19|14|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jesus received wisdom and was vouchsafed the Gospel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|48|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To believe in God's messengers (Rusul) means to be convinced that God sent men as guides to fellow human beings and [[jinn]] (khalq) to guide them to the truth.

=== Prophethood in Ahmadiyya ===
{{main article|Prophethood (Ahmadiyya)}}
The [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadiyya Community]] does not believe that messengers and prophets are different individuals. They interpret the Quranic words ''warner'' (''[[nadhir]]''), ''prophet'', and ''messenger'' as referring to different roles that the same divinely appointed individuals perform. Ahmadiyya distinguish only between law-bearing prophets and non-law-bearing ones. They believe that although law-bearing prophethood ended with Muhammad, non-law-bearing prophethood subordinate to Muhammad continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brand|first=Alexa|date=2016|title=Placing the Marginalized Ahmadiyya in Context with the Traditional Sunni Majority|url=https://journals.gmu.edu/jmgr/article/download/1330/1142|dead-url=no|journal=3|publisher=Journal of Mason Graduate Research|volume=3|pages=122-123|issn=2327-0764|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20181006041014/https://journals.gmu.edu/jmgr/article/download/1330/1142|archive-date=2018-10-06|via=Mason Publishing Journals (at [[George Mason University]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e85|title=Ahmadis - Oxford Islamic Studies Online|website=www.oxfordislamicstudies.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ahmadiyya Community recognizes [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] also known as Mirza Qadiani (1835–1908) as such a “prophet” of gods and the promised [[Messiah]] and [[Imam]] [[Mahdi]] of the latter days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mirza-Ghulam-Ahmad|title=Mirza Ghulam Ahmad {{!}} Biography &amp; Facts|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement for the Propagation of Islam|Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement]] rejects his status as a prophet, instead considering him to be a renewer of the faith.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, all other Muslims and their scholars argue and firmly establish that the Ahmadiyya community are not even Muslim due to the fact their beliefs violate the Muslim belief in Muhammad as the "Seal of the Prophets" (Khatam an-Nabiyyin).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Other persons ==
The Quran mentions 25 prophets by name but also tells that God (Allah) sent many other prophets and messengers, to all the different nations that have existed on Earth. Many verses in the Qur'an discuss this:
* "We did aforetime send messengers before thee: of them there are some whose story We have related to thee, and some whose story We have not related to thee...."&lt;ref name="quran4078"&gt;{{cite quran|40|78|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "For We assuredly sent amongst every People a messenger, ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|16|36|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other special persons in the Qur'an ===
* [[Caleb#Quranic account|Caleb (Kaleb)]]: In the Quran, Caleb is mentioned in the 5th [[surah]] of the Quran (5:20-26).
* [[Dhul-Qarnayn]]: Dhul-Qarnayn.  
* [[Joachim#In Islam|Joachim (Imran)]]: The [[Al Imran|Family of Imran]] ([[Arabic]]: '''آل عمران''') is the 3rd chapter of the Quran. ''Imran'' is [[Arabic]] for the biblical figure [[Amram]], the father of Moses and Aaron, who is regarded by Muslims as being the ancestor of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] ([[Mary in Islam|Maryām]]) and Jesus through his son Aaron. In Muslim belief, however, the [[Christian]] Joachim has been attributed the name Imran as well.
* [[Khidr]]: The Quran also mentions the mysterious Khidr (but does not name him), identified at times with [[Melchizedek]], who is the figure that Moses accompanies on one journey. Although most Muslims regard him as an enigmatic saint or an angel,&lt;ref&gt;Jill Caskey, Adam S. Cohen, Linda Safran ''Confronting the Borders of Medieval Art'' BRILL 2011 {{ISBN|978-9-004-20749-3}} page 124&lt;/ref&gt; some see him as a prophet as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/863824465|title=The A to Z of Prophets in Islam and Judaism|last=Noegel|first=Scott B.|last2=Wheeler|first2=Brannon M.|date=2010-04-01|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9781461718956|location=Lanham|pages=196-197|oclc=863824465}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Luqman]]: The Quran mentions the [[Wise old man|sage]] Luqman in [[Luqman (sura)|the chapter]] named after him, but does not clearly identify him as a prophet. The most widespread Islamic belief&lt;ref&gt;''A-Z of Prophets in Islam'', B. M. Wheeler, "Luqman"&lt;/ref&gt; views Luqman as a [[saint]], but not as a prophet. The Arabic term ''[[wali]]'' (Arabic ولي, plural Awliyā' أولياء) is commonly translated into English as "Saint". However, the wali should not be confused with the Christian tradition of sainthood. A key difference is that the wali continues what a prophet taught without any change. However, other Muslims regard Luqman as a prophet as well.&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Encyclopaedia of Islam'', Cyril Glasse, "Prophets in Islam"&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mary in Islam|Mary (Maryam)]]: A few scholars (such as [[Ibn Hazm]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalwebpost.com/farooqm/study_res/islam/gender/women_prophethood.html|title=Imam Ibn Hazm: On Prophethood of Women|last=Farooq|first=Mohammad Omar|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050312084433/http://www.globalwebpost.com/farooqm/study_res/islam/gender/women_prophethood.html|archive-date=2005-03-12|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ibrahim|first=Mohammed Zayki|date=2015|title=Ibn Ḥazm’s theory of prophecy of women: Literalism, logic, and perfection|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.831.1259&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|dead-url=no|journal=Intellectual Discourse|publisher=IIUM Press|volume=23|issue=1|pages=76-77|issn=0128-4878|eissn=2289-5639|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20181006035648/http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.831.1259&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|archive-date=2018-10-05|via=[[CiteSeerX]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; see Maryam (Mary) as a ''nabi'' and a prophetess, since God sent her a message via an angel. The Quran, however, does not explicitly identify her as a prophet. Islamic belief regards her as one of the holiest of women, but not as a prophet.&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond The Exotic: Women's Histories In Islamic Societies'', p. 402. Ed. Amira El-Azhary Sonbol. [[Syracuse University Press]], 2005. {{ISBN|9780815630555}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[People of Ya-Sin|Three persons of the town]]: These three unnamed person, who were sent to the same town, are referenced in [[Ya Sin|chapter 36]] of the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|36|13|e=21|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Original research inline|date=October 2018}}
* [[Saul#In Islam|Saul]] ([[Talut]]): Saul is not considered a prophet, but a divinely appointed king.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2115|title=Saul - Oxford Islamic Studies Online|last=|first=|date=|website=www.oxfordislamicstudies.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jacob#Children of Jacob|Sons of Jacob]]: These men are sometimes not considered to be prophets, although most exegesis scholars consider them to be prophets, citing the hadith of Muhammad and their status as prophets in Judaism. The reason that some do not consider them as prophets is because of their behaviour with Yusuf (Joseph) and that they lied to their father.

=== Other people mentioned in Islamic literature ===
Numerous other people have been mentioned by scholars in the Hadith, [[exegesis]], [[Tafsir|commentary]]. These people include:
* [[Cain and Abel in Islam|Habil]] ([[Abel]])&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

'''Salome Sellers''' (''née'' '''Sylvester'''; January 1{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}, 1800 &amp;ndash; January 9, 1909) was an American centenarian who was the last known survivor from the [[18th century]].

==Biography==
Salome Sylvester was born in [[Deer Isle, Maine]] (then part of [[Massachusetts]]), the daughter of Edward and Deborah (''née'' Cushman) Sylvester. She grew up on Deer Isle and married Joseph Sellers on 23 December 1830. The couple had six children together, Salome outliving all but her oldest son, William. She was widowed in 1865.

Due to her unusually long life, Salome was often featured in local newspapers and visited by people interested in her long life, something Salome once expressed as, "I've lived too long. I'm only a curiosity now for people to come and stare at".

Salome Sellers died in the same house she and her husband had built in 1830 in Deer Isle, Maine on 9 January 1909, aged 109 years, 8 days. Her house is now known as the [[Salome Sellers House]] and home to the Deer Isle-Stonington Historical Society. There has also been a book written about her life: "An Island Woman: Salome Sylvester Sellers, 1800-1909".

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Scaea''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: Σκαιήν means "left, on the left hand"), was one of the [[Daughters of Danaus|Danaids]].

==Family==
Scaea was the daughter of [[Danaus]], king of [[Libya]] and of [[Europa (Greek myth)|Europe]], a queen. She was the full sister of other Danaids namely Automate, [[Amymone]] and [[Agave (mythology)|Agave]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[Pseudo-Apollodorus]]. ''Bibliotheca, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+2.1.5&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022 Book 2.1.5]''&lt;/ref&gt; Scaea was married to [[Daiphron]], son of [[Aegyptus]] and later to [[Archander]] of whom she had begotten a son, [[Metanastes]].

==Mythology==
Scaea like her other sisters, except [[Hypermnestra]], killed their husbands on their wedding night at the behest of their father Danaus.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because of the murder, later on, Scaea and her sisters were punished in afterlife, being forced to carry a jug to fill a bathtub (pithos) without a bottom (or with a leak) to wash their sins off. The water was always leaking that they would forever try to fill the tub.

In some accounts, Scaea remarried Archander while her sister Automate took as husband his brother [[Architeles]]. These two were sons of [[Achaeus (son of Xuthus)|Achaeus]], coming from [[Phthiotis]] to settle in [[Argos]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].

[[File:Roma, repubblica, moneta di p. satrienus, 77 ac..JPG|thumb|350px|The she-wolf on a coin of the late Roman republic (c.77 BC)]]
In the [[Founding of Rome|Roman foundation myth]], it was a '''she-wolf''' that nursed and sheltered the twins [[Romulus and Remus]] after they were abandoned in the wild by order of [[Amulius|King Amulius]] of [[Alba Longa]]. She cared for the infants at her den, a cave known as the [[Lupercal]], until they were discovered by a shepherd, [[Faustulus]]. [[Romulus]] would later become the founder and first king of Rome. The image of the she-wolf suckling the twins has been a symbol of [[Rome]] since ancient times and is one of the most recognizable icons of ancient mythology.&lt;ref&gt; Wiseman ''Remus'' preface pg xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
There is evidence that the wolf held a special place in the world of the ancient inhabitants of Italy.  One legend claims that the [[Hirpini]] people were so-called because, when they set out to found their first colony,  they were led to its location by a wolf (from the Sabine word for wolf: ''hirpus'').&lt;ref&gt; Strabo Book V Ch.12 (''Loeb'' pg.467) &lt;/ref&gt;  The tale of the Lupercal is central to that of the twins, and probably predates theirs. To the Roman god [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] the wolf is a sacred animal.  There is an ongoing debate about a connection to the ancient Roman festival of the [[Lupercalia]].

In [[Greek mythology]], [[Apollo]]'s mother [[Leto]] is reported to have given birth to him as a she-wolf, to evade [[Hera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Aristotle]]|accessdate=5 December 2016|title=History of Animals|url=https://www.loebclassics.com/view/aristotle-history_animals/1965/pb_LCL438.345.xml?rskey=9mJ3UR&amp;result=1&amp;mainRsKey=S0vjOz|doi=10.4159/DLCL.aristotle-history_animals.1965}} {{Subscription needed|via=[[Loeb Classical Library|digital Loeb Classical Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary sources==
The 3 "canonical" versions of the myth--those of [[Livy]], [[Plutarch]] and [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]]--all draw heavily on [[Quintus Fabius Pictor]].&lt;ref&gt; Dionysius I 79&lt;/ref&gt;  He is considered one of Rome's earliest historians and his now lost work describes the she-wolf and her episode with the twins.  The twins were abandoned at the order of Amulius.  Some tales claim that they were to be left along the riverbank, others that they were to be cast into the water. The servant charged with the task either thought better of it, or could not get close enough to do the deed because of the flooding.  Instead, he left them in the standing water that had formed at the foot of [[Palatine Hill]].  The twins were found either after their basket had been left at the foot of the fig tree, or came to rest there after floating in the water.  In each case, the she-wolf rescued them and gently cared for them in or near the Lupercal.  Later, they were discovered by local shepherds.

Dionysius reports that rains had raised the water level such that when Amulius' servant arrived at the appointed spot (around a dozen miles from Alba Longa), they left the twins in the floodwaters because they couldn't go any further.  The basket they were in floated along until the waters receded and it struck a stone, tossing them out into the mud.  The she-wolf arrived and lowered her teats to the crying babes and licked them clean of the mud.

After a shepherd happened upon the scene in the course of tending his flock, he ran to tell his companions, and a group gathered to witness the remarkable sight. The twins were clinging to her as she was their true mother. The she-wolf was nonplussed when the men began making a ruckus to scare her off. She withdrew into a cave that was sacred to the [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Greek colonists]] who had formerly lived in the area and held an altar to the nature god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]].&lt;ref&gt; Dionysius I ch.79&lt;/ref&gt;

Livy claims that the servants of Amulius dropped the twins in the standing water out of simple laziness.  The fig tree just happened to be the first spot they came to and they figured the twins would drown no matter what.  The twins cried in their basket until the waters receded and left them back on land.  The she-wolf arrived from the hills looking for a drink of water when she heard their cries.&lt;ref&gt; Livy I pp.17-19&lt;/ref&gt;

The servant was too afraid of the torrential waters to fully carry out the king's orders, according to Plutarch.  After being left on the bank, the waters rose further and swept the twins away.  It gently carried them along and then dropped them at the fig tree.&lt;ref&gt; Plutarch ''Romulus'' IV pp.99&lt;/ref&gt;

The three relay accounts wherein the term "lupa" refers not to a she-wolf, but is a slang word for prostitute.  Plutarch tells two other stories not involving the she-wolf or abandonment.  In one, the twins are fathered by [[Hercules]] after he wins a dice game.  Their mother is the unwitting "prize".  In another, the twins are switched at birth by their grandfather for a different pair of infants and secreted out of the city to be raised by shepherds and later, educated in nearby [[Gabii]].&lt;ref&gt; Plutarch ''Romulus'' IV pp.101-105&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Scan of Figurehead from Geschichte der Kunst des Alterhums band 1 (1776).png|thumb|right|Figurehead from the title page of ''Geschichte der Kunst des Alterhums''  Vol. 1 (1776) by [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]].  Winckelmann was a pioneer in the study of Graeco-Roman art and [[ancient Roman art]] in particular.  He is center, with the she-wolf suckling the twins and [[Homer]] closest to him.  The [[Sphinx]] and an [[Etruscan art|Etruscan vase]] are in the background.]]

===Earliest representation===
The "Bolsena Mirror" features a depiction of the she-wolf and the twins surrounded by human and animal figures.  Differences in interpretation have precluded virtually any consensus regarding many of its features.&lt;ref&gt; Mazzoni pp173-178&lt;/ref&gt;  This includes its age.  However, it is consistent with other such mirrors, made as bridal gifts, in 4th century BC Euritria, perhaps circa 330-340.  The famous [[Capitoline Wolf]] may be of [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] or [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Old Latin]] origin.&lt;ref&gt; Tennant p.81&lt;/ref&gt;  But, a discovery during its restoration in 2000 and [[radiocarbon dating]] has cast doubt on an ancient origin.&lt;ref name="laregina2006"&gt;Adriano La Regina,"[http://www.repubblica.it/2006/11/sezioni/spettacoli_e_cultura/lupa-scultura-roma/lupa-scultura-roma/lupa-scultura-roma.html ''Roma, l'inganno della Lupa è "nata" nel Medioevo]'' "Rome: the phony She-Wolf wasn't born until the Middle-ages" La Republica. 17 November 2006, accessed 1 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[stele]] from [[Bologna]], dated to between 350-400 BC, depicts an animal, possibly a wolf, nursing a single infant.  By 269 BC, the silver [[drachm|didrachm]] is the earliest depiction of the complete icon, with the characteristic "turning of the she-wolf's head" backward and downward at the twins.&lt;ref&gt;Rissanen p.336&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinctive imagery of the she-wolf and the twins made it more recognizable than other symbols of the city, such as [[Roma (mythology)|Roma]], the patron deity of the city, or the [[Aquila (Roman)|Roman eagle]].  That was useful as the Roman world expanded and symbols of Rome became more important in maintaining unity.&lt;ref&gt;Rissanen p.336&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1st century AD, the she-wolf was common in both Rome and the provinces.  She and the twins were featured on the elaborate [[Ara Pacis]], built in honor of [[Augustus]] and dedicated to [[Pax (goddess)|Pax]], the goddess of peace.&lt;ref&gt; Rissanen p.336-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Coins with their depiction were minted and widely circulated.  They were also produced in Roman Colonies as a way to express their own "Roman-ness".&lt;ref&gt; Rissanen p.339&lt;/ref&gt;  They have been found on personal items such as swords, buckles, lamps and statuettes as well as monuments, mosaic floors and funerary stones that date from the 1st through the 3rd centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt; Rissanen p.343-7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Siena She-Wolf===
The [[Siena|Sienese]] have a traditional tale that the city was founded by [[Senius and Aschius]], another pair of twins who were also suckled by a she-wolf.  They were the sons of Remus and fled Rome after his death at the hands of their uncle Romulus.  The legend cannot be attested to prior to the Renaissance.  However, depictions of a she-wolf and twins are common in the city and some can be dated earlier.

The [[Lupercalia]] was a very ancient festival even during Roman times.  Roman historians speculated as to its origins.  It may be associated with the god [[Lupercus]], the god of [[Pastoralism|shepherds]] and protector of flocks.  Some historians link it to the she-wolf and the Lupercal.

A '''shield-maiden''' ({{lang-non|skjaldmær}}), in [[Scandinavian folklore]] and [[Norse mythology|mythology]] was a female warrior. They are often mentioned in [[saga]]s such as ''[[Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks]]'' and in ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''. Shield-maidens also appear in stories of other [[Germanic peoples]]: [[Goths]], [[Cimbri]], and [[Marcomanni]].&lt;ref name="nordisk"&gt;[http://runeberg.org/nfce/0728.html The article ''Sköldmö''] in ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'' (1917).&lt;/ref&gt; The mythical [[valkyrie]]s may have been based on the shield-maidens.&lt;ref name="nordisk"/&gt;

==Historical existence==
The historical existence of shield-maidens is heavily debated, but scholars including [[Neil Price (archaeologist)|Neil Price]],&lt;ref name="history.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/shows/vikings/videos/secrets-of-the-vikings-shield-maidens|title=Secrets of the Vikings: Shield Maidens|website=www.history.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125132543/http://www.history.com/shows/vikings/videos/secrets-of-the-vikings-shield-maidens|archivedate=25 January 2016|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that they existed while others, like scholar Judith Jesch disagree, citing a lack of hard evidence for trained or regular women warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/04/19/viking-women-warriors-and-valkyries/|title=Viking women, warriors, and valkyries|website=blog.britishmuseum.org|date=19 April 2014|first=Judith|last=Jesch|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194313/http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/04/19/viking-women-warriors-and-valkyries/|archivedate=3 March 2016|deadurl=yes|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/world/europe/sweden-viking-women-warriors-dna.html|title=A Female Viking Warrior?

==Historical accounts==
There are few historic attestations that [[Viking Age]] women took part in warfare, but the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] historian [[John Skylitzes]] records that women fought in battle when [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev]] attacked the Byzantines in [[Bulgaria]] in 971.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; When the [[Varangians]] (not to be confused with the Byzantine [[Varangian Guard]]) had suffered a devastating defeat in the [[Siege of Dorostolon]], the victors were stunned at discovering armed women among the fallen warriors.&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;Harrison, D. &amp; Svensson, K. (2007). ''Vikingaliv''. Fälth &amp; Hässler, Värnamo. {{ISBN|978-91-27-35725-9}}. p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Leif Erikson]]'s pregnant half-sister [[Freydís Eiríksdóttir]] was in [[Vinland]], she is reported to have taken up a sword, and, bare-breasted, scared away the attacking [[Skræling]]s.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; The fight is recounted in the ''[[Greenland saga]]'', though Freydís is not explicitly referred to as a shield-maiden in the text.&lt;ref name=Thorsson&gt;Thorsson, Ö. (Ed.) ''The Sagas of the Icelanders.'' Penguin Books, 1997. Anyway a mention of a single woman picking up a sword once can not be considered evidence of actual trained  female warriors.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saxo Grammaticus reported that shield-maidens fought on the side of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] at the [[Battle of Brávellir]] in the year 750:
{{quote|Now out of the town of Sle, under the captains [[Heiðr|Hetha]] (Heid) and Wisna, with Hakon Cut-cheek came Tummi the Sailmaker. On these captains, who had the bodies of women, nature bestowed the souls of men. [[Webiorg]] was also inspired with the same spirit, and was attended by Bo (Bui) Bramason and Brat the Jute, thirsting for war.|[[Saxo Grammaticus]]&lt;ref name=Saxo&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elton|first1=Oliver|title=THE DANISH HISTORY,  BOOKS I-IX by  Saxo Grammaticus|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1150|website=Project Gutenberg|publisher=Project Gutenberg|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Legendary accounts==
Examples of shield-maidens mentioned by name in the Norse sagas include [[Brynhildr]] in the ''[[Vǫlsunga saga]]'', [[Hervor]] in ''[[Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks]]'', the Brynhildr of the ''[[Bósa saga ok Herrauðs]]'', the Swedish princess Thornbjǫrg in ''[[Hrólfs saga Gautrekssonar]]'' and Princess Hed, Visna and [[Veborg]] in ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''.

Two shield-maidens appear in certain translations of the ''Hervarar saga''. The first of these Hervors was known to have taken up typically masculine roles early in her childhood and often raided travelers in the woods dressed as a man. Later in her life, she claimed the cursed sword [[Tyrfing]] from her father's burial site and became a seafaring raider.  She eventually settled and married. Her granddaughter was also named Hervor and commanded forces against attacking [[Huns]]. Although the saga remarks on her bravery she is mortally wounded by enemy forces and dies on the battlefield.&lt;ref name=Tolkien&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars Judith Jesch and Jenny Jochens theorize that shield-maidens' often grim fates or their sudden return to typically female roles is a testament to their role as figures of both male and female fantasy as well as emblematic of the danger of abandoning gender roles.&lt;ref name=Tolkien&gt;{{cite web|last=Tolkien|first=Christopher|title=The Saga of King Heidrik the Wise|url=http://vsnrweb-publications.org.uk/The%20Saga%20Of%20King%20Heidrek%20The%20Wise.pdf|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons Ltd.|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brynhildr Buðladóttir and Guðrún Gjúkadóttir===
{{Main|Brynhildr}}
Brynhildr of the ''Vǫlsunga saga'', along with her rival in love, [[Gudrun|Guðrún Gjúkadóttir]], provides an example of how a shield-maiden compares to more conventional aristocratic womanhood in the sagas.  Brynhildr is chiefly concerned with honor, much like a male warrior.  When she ends up married to Gudrun's brother [[Gunther|Gunnarr]] instead of [[Sigurd|Sigurðr]], the man she intended to marry, Brynhildr speaks a verse comparing the courage of the two men:
{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;Sigurd fought the dragon
And that afterward will be
Forgotten by no one
While men still live.
Yet your brother
Neither dared
To ride into the fire
Nor to leap across it.&lt;ref name=Byock&gt;Byock, Jesse L. (Trans.) ''Saga of the Volsungs.''University of California Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Brynhildr is married to Gunnarr and not Sigurðr because of deceit and trickery, including a potion of forgetfulness given to Sigurðr so he forgets his previous relationship with her.&lt;ref name=Byock/&gt; Brynhildr is upset not only for the loss of Sigurðr but also for the dishonesty involved. Similar to her male counterparts, the shield-maiden prefers to do things straightforwardly, without the deception considered stereotypically feminine in much of medieval literature. She enacts her vengeance directly, resulting in the deaths of herself, Sigurðr, and Sigurð's son by Guðrún. By killing the child, she demonstrates an understanding of feud and filial responsibility; if he lived, the boy would grow up to take vengeance on Brynhildr's family.

Guðrún has a similar concern with family ties, but at first does not usually act directly. She is more inclined to incite her male relatives to action than take up arms herself. Guðrún is no shield-maiden, and Brynhildr mocks her for this, saying, "Only ask what is best for you to know. That is suitable for noble women. And it is easy to be satisfied while everything happens according to your desires."&lt;ref name=Byock/&gt; In her later marriages, however, she is willing to kill her children, burn down a hall, and send her other sons to avenge the murder of her daughter, Svanhildr. In the world of the sagas, women can be both honorable and remorseless, much like the male heroes. While a shield-maiden does not fill a woman's typical role, her strength of character is found in even the more domestic women in these stories.

==Archaeology==
Graves of female settlers containing weapons have been uncovered, but scholars do not agree how these should be interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencenordic.com/don’t-underestimate-viking-women|title=Don’t underestimate Viking women|date=2 January 2013|first=Arild S.|last=Foss|website=sciencenordic.com|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norse immigrant graves in [[England]] and chemical analysis of the remains suggested a somewhat equal distribution of men and women, suggesting husbands and wives, while some of the women were buried with weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Warriors and women: the sex ratio of Norse migrants to eastern England up to 900 AD | last = McLeod | first = Shane | work = Early Medieval Europe | publisher = Wiley | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 332–353 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0254.2011.00323.x/full | doi=10.1111/j.1468-0254.2011.00323.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Invasion of the Viking women unearthed | url = http://content.usatoday.com/communities/sciencefair/post/2011/07/invasion-of-the-viking-women-unearthed/1?csp=34news#.U6xrxBwcqs8 | date = July 19, 2011 | publisher = [[USA Today]] | last = Vergano | first = Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a tie-in special to the TV series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'' Neil Price showed that a 10th Century [[Birka]]-burial excavated in the 1970s containing a large number of weapons and the bones of two horses turned out to be the grave of a woman upon bone analysis by Anna Kjellström.&lt;ref name="history.com"/&gt; In 2017, DNA analysis confirmed that the person was female&lt;ref name=jonson2017&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ajpa.23308|title=A female Viking warrior confirmed by genomics|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|year=2017|last1=Hedenstierna-Jonson|first1=Charlotte|last2=Kjellström|first2=Anna|last3=Zachrisson|first3=Torun|last4=Krzewińska|first4=Maja|last5=Sobrado|first5=Veronica|last6=Price|first6=Neil|last7=Günther|first7=Torsten|last8=Jakobsson|first8=Mattias|last9=Götherström|first9=Anders|last10=Storå|first10=Jan}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the so called [[Birka female Viking warrior]], but others including respected scholar of the Vikings, Judith Jesch says that conclusion is premature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/world/europe/sweden-viking-women-warriors-dna.html|title=A Female Viking Warrior?

==In popular culture==
While women warriors are a staple of [[fantasy]], they are not often referred to as shield-maidens. Some who are include [[Éowyn]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and Thorgil in [[Nancy Farmer]]'s ''[[The Sea of Trolls]]'' trilogy.

In the 2013 TV series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'', the legendary Viking shield-maiden [[Lagertha]], played by [[Katheryn Winnick]], is a principal character.

They fought to have women legally considered persons so that women could be appointed to the Senate. The petition was filed on August 27, 1927,&lt;ref name="Alberta1999"&gt;{{cite book| title=Alberta History| volume=47–49| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jL06AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=famous+five+persons+case+august+27&amp;dq=famous+five+persons+case+august+27| accessdate=May 10, 2013| year=1999| publisher=Historical Society of Alberta}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on April 24, 1928, Canada's Supreme Court summarized its unanimous decision that women are not such "persons".&lt;ref name = Brennan/&gt;

The last line of the judgement reads, "Understood to mean 'Are women eligible for appointment to the [[Senate of Canada]],' the question is answered in the negative." This judgement was overturned by the British [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] on October 18, 1929. This case came to be known as the "[[Persons Case]]". Although Canadian women (those who were British/Canadian citizens) had the vote in many provinces and in federal elections by 1929, the case was part of a continent-wide drive for political equality, coming seven years after discrimination against women's voting rights was prohibited in the United States through the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], and thus had important ramifications.

Some saw this as "radical change"; others saw it as a restoration of the original framing of the English constitutional documents, including the [[1689 Bill of Rights]], which uses only the term "person", not the term "man" (or "woman" for that matter).

Some others have interpreted the Privy Council rule as causing a change in the Canadian judicial approach to the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]], an approach that has come to be known as the "[[living tree doctrine]]".

==The Five==
The famous five women were:

* [[Emily Murphy]] (1868–1933), the [[British Empire]]'s first female judge;
* [[Irene Parlby|Irene Marryat Parlby]] (1868–1965), farm women's leader, political activist and first female [[Cabinet minister]] in Alberta, still serving in that capacity at the time of the court case;
* [[Nellie McClung|Nellie Mooney McClung]] (1873–1951), a [[suffragist]] and author, member of the Alberta Legislature 1921–1926;
* [[Louise McKinney|Louise Crummy McKinney]] (1868–1931), the first woman elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]], or any legislature in Canada or the rest of the British Empire, but no longer MLA at the time of the court case;
* [[Henrietta Muir Edwards]] (1849–1931), an advocate for working women, author and a founding member of the [[Victorian Order of Nurses]].

===Emily Murphy===
{{Main|Emily Murphy}}
Emily Murphy stood out in the famous five, bringing them to a victory in 1929. Emily was appointed to the office of Magistrate of the Edmonton Juvenile Court in 1916 and later became the magistrate of the newly created Women's Court. At the time, no woman had held such a position and many men objected.&lt;ref name=MacEwan&gt;{{cite book |first=Grant| last=MacEwan| title=...and Mighty Women too: Stories of Notable Western Canadian Women| year=1975| publisher= Western Producer Prairie Books| isbn=978-0919306653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her career as a writer, Murphy used the pen name "Janey Canuck". In 1922, she wrote ''The Black Candle'' which detailed her beliefs on race and drug use in Canada and strongly influenced the drug policy of the day. Murphy came from a privileged background in which white women were protected from many topics.&lt;ref name="Millar"&gt;{{cite book |first=Nancy |last=Millar |title=The Famous Five: Five Canadian Women and Their Fight to Become Persons |year=1999 |publisher=Western Heritage Centre| isbn=978-0920109168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irene Parlby===
{{Main|Irene Parlby}}
In 1916, Irene Parlby was elected as the first president of the United Farm Women of Alberta and in 1921, was elected to the Alberta legislature and received a cabinet post in the United Farmers of Alberta government, becoming the second woman in the British Empire to hold ministerial rank. She served as cabinet minister until the downfall of the government in 1935. Parlby worked with the Red Cross during [[World War I]] and later served on the Board of Governors of the [[University of Alberta]].&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

===Nellie McClung===
{{Main|Nellie McClung}}
Nellie McClung's jobs in her lifetime included teacher, author, public speaker, temperance activist, internationally known women's rights activist, and politician {Warne, Literature as Pulpit].

She represented Canada at the Ecumenical Council of the Methodist church in 1921 and was the first woman on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] Board of the Governors.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;  In 1921, McClung was elected to the Alberta legislature as an MLA in Edmonton for the Liberal Party.&lt;ref name=Millar/&gt; She served one term, not being re-elected in 1926. She was a member of the Political Equality League of Manitoba, and she played the leading role in the Mock Parliament held on January 29, 1914, at the Walker Theatre in Winnipeg, which humorously discussed Votes for Men.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

===Louise McKinney===

Louise McKinney became one of the first two women elected to a legislature in the British Empire, and the first to take her seat. She was a founder of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] in Alberta and the West – she served as the organization's vice-president for more than 22 years beginning in 1906 – and regularly attended World Meetings of the WCTU. She signed the appeal to the Privy Council in 1929. In 1931, she became president of the Canadian Union, Woman's Christian Temperance Union. McKinney was also named to be Commissioner for the first General Council of the [[United Church of Canada]], and was the only woman to sign the Basis of Union.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

===Henrietta Muir Edwards===
{{Main|Henrietta Muir Edwards}}
Henrietta Muir Edwards, author and researcher on women's topics, held an influence within the National Council of Women&lt;ref name = Brennan/&gt; and held chairmanship of the Committee in Law in the National Council of Women for more than 35 years. She was also a Red Cross leader during the war years. Edwards was the secretary of the National Subcommittee which focused on thrift and economy in Canadian homes.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

==Legacy==

===Honorary senators===
None of the five became [[Senate of Canada#Senators|senators]]; the first female senator was Quebecer [[Cairine Reay Wilson]], appointed four months after the ruling. Nearly 80 years later, on October 8, 2009, the Senate voted to make the five the first "honorary senators".&lt;ref name=cbc&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/story/2009/10/10/calgary-famous-five-honourary-senators.html |title='Famous 5' named honorary senators |work=[[CBC News]] |publisher=CBC.ca |date=October 10, 2009 |accessdate=May 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hansard&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/common/..%5C40%5C2%5Cparlbus%5Cchambus%5Csenate/deb-E/059db_2009-10-08-e.htm?Language=E&amp;Parl=40&amp;Ses=2#53|title=Senate of Canada – Debates|first=Senate of|last=Canada|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The achievement of personhood for women had been a monumental change which gave more power to women.

Some might well question the overall significance of the decision, noting that by the 1920s the Senate of Canada was a largely powerless body. The more powerful [[House of Commons of Canada]] had elected its first female member ([[Agnes Macphail]]) in 1921, well before the Persons Case. However, the precedent did establish the principle that women could hold any political office in Canada. Moreover, the Five clearly did devote their energies to increasing women's participation on legislative bodies with greater power: three had been members of the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|Alberta legislature]]. The controversy surrounding the women has made commemoration difficult.{{Citation needed|date = August 2012}} The five women were activists in a variety of areas in their pursuit to better the conditions for women and children.

===Opinions on the Famous Five===
Opinions on the Famous Five vary considerably. Many laud them as trailblazers for women. Others are disturbed by the opinions of some of the women on other issues, such as opposition to non-white immigration and their successful campaigns to have [[eugenics]] legislation introduced in Canadian provinces, which resulted in the sterilization of thousands of those deemed "mentally deficient" or "insane" in Alberta and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/eugenics-keeping-canada-sane-feature/&lt;/ref&gt; Emily Murphy was not shy with her opinions and her outspoken nature had a tendency to give her a negative reputation. She wrote letters of her opinions to police chiefs, government officials, social service agencies and judicial officials about the extent of drug traffic and possible cures. Nellie McClung was known as the most memorable and popular of the famous five. Her causes included women's right to vote, prohibition, women in the church and women in public life.&lt;ref name=Millar/&gt;  Henrietta Muir Edwards was described as "tenacious" with her work with prohibition.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

The five women were activists in a variety of areas in their pursuit to better the conditions for women and children. Emily Murphy dealt with single mothers and issues of child support, child welfare, and adoption by lobbying for women's rights.&lt;ref name = Sharpe&gt;{{cite book| first=Robert J.| last=Sharpe| title=The Persons Case: The Origins and Legacy of the Fight for Legal Personhood| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HOwC1vcGgcEC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4| isbn=978-0802096289| year=2007| publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nellie McClung favoured free medical and dental treatment for school children as well as mothers' allowances and better property rights for women. She was open to divorce and birth control but opposed the sale and use of liquor. Louise McKinney believed strongly in the "evils of alcohol" and pushed to enact prohibition measures. She advocated excluding cigarettes from parcels sent to soldiers in World War&amp;nbsp;I in 1917. She supported reasonable measures for social welfare and health as well as introducing bills intended to make prohibition more effective, to improve the lot of immigrants and bring better security to widows. She was responsible for the introduction of a motion which led to the [[Dower Act]]. Irene Parlby in her position as cabinet minister in Alberta pursued these goals expressed by McKinney. Henrietta Edwards worked with property law and sought to protect women and children.&lt;ref name=Millar/&gt;

===Commemorations===
The Famous Five have been commemorated with individual and group plaques in the [[Centre Block#Senate foyer|foyer]] and antechamber of Canada's Senate, and two identical sculptures by Canadian artist [[Barbara Paterson]], one on [[Parliament Hill]] in [[Ottawa]], the other at the [[Olympic Plaza (Calgary)|Olympic Plaza]] in [[Calgary]]. The sculpture on Parliament Hill was unveiled on October 18, 2000, in a public ceremony that included [[French language in Canada|French]] and [[Canadian English|English]] singers, [[Inuit]] dancers, and speeches by [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Adrienne Clarkson]] and [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Jean Chrétien]]. A sculpture of the Famous Five by sculptor Helen Granger Young stands on the grounds of the Manitoba Legislature in Winnipeg. Commissioned by the Nellie McClung Foundation, it was unveiled at a ceremony on June 18, 2010.

The City of [[Edmonton]] has named one park in its River Valley Parks System after each of the "Famous Five".&lt;ref name="edmonton"&gt;{{cite web| title=Alphabetical Park Listing| url=http://www.edmonton.ca/attractions_recreation/parks_rivervalley/alphabetical-park-listing.aspx| publisher=City of Edmonton| date=May 14, 2012| accessdate=May 14, 2012| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127115516/http://edmonton.ca/attractions_recreation/parks_rivervalley/alphabetical-park-listing.aspx| archivedate=November 27, 2012| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murphy had many accomplishments, such as becoming the first president of the Federated Women's Institute of Canada, vice-president of [[National Council of Women]] of Canada, president of [[Canadian Women's Press Club]], director of the Canadian Council of Child Welfare, vice-president of the Canadian Association of Child Protection, first president of the Women's Canadian Club of Edmonton and vice-president of the Social Service Council of Canada. Emily Murphy also received many honours for her life's work including being decorated by King [[George V]] to be a Lady of Grace of the [[Order of Saint John (chartered 1888)|Order of St. John of Jerusalem]].

Irene Parlby was honoured in 1935 at spring convocation at the [[University of Alberta]] with an honorary LL.D. degree. Tributes in honour of Henrietta Edwards can be found on a plaque in the Senate Chamber in Ottawa and another in the post office in Fort Macleod. Nellie McClung spoke in Calgary after Edwards' passing and spoke of Edwards, "who for 40 years was convener of laws for the National Council of Women" should not be forgotten.&lt;ref name="MacEwan" /&gt;

Along with [[Thérèse Casgrain]], the Five were commemorated in the 2001 [[Journey Series (banknotes)|Journey Series]] of Canada's [[Canadian fifty-dollar bill|fifty-dollar bill]].&lt;ref name=Brennan/&gt;  In December 2011, the [[Bank of Canada]] announced that the Famous Five would not appear on the redesigned $50 [[Frontier Series]] banknote that it issued in 2012.&lt;ref name="50dollars"&gt;{{cite news| title=Should the new $50 bill show an Arctic research boat instead of the Famous Five?| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/yourcommunity/2011/12/should-the-new-50-bill-show-an-arctic-research-boat-instead-of-the-famous-five.html| work=CBC News| date=December 7, 2011| publisher=cbc.ca| accessdate=May 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The achievement of personhood for women had been a monumental change which gave more power to women. To honour the Five and continue to involve women in leadership roles in Canada, Frances Wright and others established the non-profit Famous Five Foundation on October 18, 1996, the 70th anniversary of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council's decision.&lt;ref name="5foundation"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.famous5.ca/index.php/about-us/about-us| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225022456/http://www.famous5.ca/index.php/about-us/about-us| dead-url=yes| archive-date=December 25, 2012| title=About Us| publisher=Famous 5 Foundation| date=| accessdate=May 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''Thirty-Six Immortals of Poetry'''|三十六歌仙|Sanjūrokkasen}} are a group of Japanese poets of the [[Asuka period|Asuka]], [[Nara period|Nara]], and [[Heian period]]s selected by [[Fujiwara no Kintō]] as exemplars of [[waka (poetry)|Japanese poetic ability]]. The eldest surviving collection of the 36 poets' works is ''[[Nishi Honganji Sanjū-rokunin Kashu]]'' ("Nishi Honganji 36 poets collection") of 1113. Similar groups of Japanese poets include the [[Kamakura period]] ''Nyōbō Sanjūrokkasen'' (女房三十六歌仙), composed by court ladies exclusively, and the {{nihongo|''Chūko Sanjūrokkasen''|中古三十六歌仙}}, or Thirty-Six Heian-era Immortals of Poetry, selected by [[Fujiwara no Norikane]] 藤原範兼 (1107–1165). This list superseded an older group called the [[Six Immortals of Poetry]].

Sets of portraits (essentially imaginary) of the group were popular in [[Japanese painting]] and later [[woodblock printing in Japan|woodblock prints]], and often hung in temples.

[[File:Trauco.jpg|thumb|Artist's representation of the Trauco]]

In the traditional [[Chilota mythology]] of [[Chiloé]], the '''Trauco''' is a humanoid creature of small stature - similar to a [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]] or [[goblin]] - who lives in the deep forests. It has an ugly face, and legs without feet.

== Legend ==
The '''Trauco''' is a mythical entity who inhabits the woods of [[Chiloé]], an island in the south of [[Chile]]. It has a powerful magnetism that attracts young and middle-aged women. According to myth, the Trauco's wife is the wicked and ugly '''Fiura'''. The trauco carries a small stone-headed hatchet that he uses to strike trees in the forest to symbolize his sexual potency.

Whomever the Trauco chooses will go to him, even if she is sleeping, and fall enraptured at his feet. No woman can resist his magical attraction; all have sexual intercourse with him. Some men of Chiloé fear the Trauco, as his gaze can be deadly.

When a single woman is pregnant and no one steps forward as the father, people assume that the Trauco is the father. Because the Trauco is irresistible, the woman is considered blameless. The Trauco is sometimes invoked to explain sudden or unwanted pregnancies, especially in unmarried women.

== Media ==

The Trauco appears in [[The Luke Coles Book Series]] by [[Josh Walker (author)|Josh Walker]] where he functions as an antagonist in some of the subplots.

'''Winamac''' was the name of a number of [[Potawatomi]] leaders and warriors beginning in the late 17th century. The name derives from a man named Wilamet, a Native American from an eastern tribe who in 1681 was appointed to serve as a liaison between [[New France]] and the natives of the [[Lake Michigan]] region. Wilamet was adopted by the Potawatomis, and his name, which meant "Catfish" in his native [[Eastern Algonquian]] language, was soon transformed into "Winamac", which means the same thing in the [[Potawatomi language]]. The Potawatomi version of the name has been spelled in a variety of ways, including Winnemac, Winamek, and Winnemeg.

The Winamac name became associated with prominent members of the Fish clan of the Potawatomi tribe. In 1701, Winamac or Wilamet was a chief of the Potawatomi villages along the [[St. Joseph River (Lake Michigan)|St. Joseph River]] in what is now the U.S. state of [[Michigan]]. This man or another of the same name was an ally of New France who helped negotiate an end to the [[Fox Wars]] in the 1730s. Two other Winamacs were prominent during the [[War of 1812]]. One was active opponent of the United States, while the other was a U.S. ally. These two Winamacs have often been confused with each other.

In 1681, a group of Native Americans from several [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes of [[New England]] accompanied French explorer [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] on an expedition to the west.&lt;ref name="Clifton, 19-20"&gt;Clifton, 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt; One of these Natives, Wilamet (or Ouilamette or Wilamek), was appointed by La Salle to serve as a laison between [[New France]] and the natives of the [[Lake Michigan]] region.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilamet was adopted by the [[Potawatomi]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Susan Sleeper-Smith, ''Indian Women and French Men: Rethinking Cultural Encounter in the Western Great Lakes'' (Amherst: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 2001), 175n35.&lt;/ref&gt; and his name, which meant "Catfish" in his native [[Eastern Algonquian]] language, was eventually transformed into "Winamac", which means the same thing in the [[Potawatomi language]].&lt;ref name="Clifton, 19-20"/&gt; Before long, he was recognized by the French as the "chief" of the Potawatomi villages along the [[St. Joseph River (Lake Michigan)|St. Joseph River]] in what is now the U.S. state of [[Michigan]].&lt;ref name="Clifton, 78"&gt;Clifton, 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilamet was therefore not a traditional Potawatomi leader (or ''okama''&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 57.&lt;/ref&gt;), but was instead a "chief" appointed by the French.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 85-86.&lt;/ref&gt; French-appointed chiefs were a common feature of the [[Franco-Indian alliance]]. According to historian [[Richard White (historian)|Richard White]], "as the French singled out certain leaders to be the channels by which French power entered the villages, they created a new kind of chief which can best be distinguished as an alliance chief".&lt;ref&gt;White, 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilamet helped La Salle promote French policies while countering [[Iroquois]] influence in the Lake Michigan region.&lt;ref name="Clifton, 78"/&gt; In 1694, a man named Ouilamek, probably the same Wilamet, led 30 Potawatomis in an expedition under [[Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac|Cadillac]] against the Iroquois.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1701, Wilamet and [[Onanghisse]] (or Onangizes), another prominent Potawatomi alliance chief,&lt;ref&gt;White, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; represented the Potawatomis at the great [[Treaty of Montreal]], which ended the war with the Iroquois.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Fox Wars]] (1712–1733), a Wilamek was a leader of the Fish clan of the St. Joseph Potawatomis.&lt;ref name="Clifton, 89"&gt;Clifton, 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian David Edmunds portrays this man as the same one who had attended the 1701 treaty, although Richard White writes that a Wilamek of this era was of a man of [[Sauk people|Sauk]] and [[Meskwaki]] (Fox) parentage who had married into the Potawatomi tribe.&lt;ref&gt;White, 171.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1719, Wilamek traveled to Montreal with a group of Meskwaki leaders in an effort to make peace.&lt;ref name="Clifton, 89"/&gt; The following year, his son was captured by the Meskwakis, but he was later released.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 89; Edmunds, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==War of 1812 era==
{{further|Indiana in the War of 1812|Illinois Territory in the War of 1812}}
During the [[War of 1812]] era, the Potawatomis, like other tribes, were divided over whether to oppose the expansion of the United States or to seek peaceful accommodation. Two men named Winamac were prominent in this era. One was an active opponent of the United States, while the other became a U.S. ally. These two men have often been confused with each other.&lt;ref name="Edmunds, 307n66"&gt;Edmunds, 307n66.&lt;/ref&gt; American historians have often distinguished them by referring to the "anti-American" or "hostile" Winamek and the "pro-American" or "friendly" Winamek.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 528; Edmunds, 307n66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-American Winamac===
The "anti-American" Winamac was a Potawatomi leader who first appears in the historical record in 1810. That year, while returning from an unsuccessful raid against the [[Osage people|Osages]], Winamac's party stole horses from some white Illinois settlers. The settlers pursued the raiders, and the Potawatomis attacked, killing four men. Governor [[Ninian Edwards]] demanded that the Potawatomis surrender the raiders, but chief [[Chief Gomo|Gomo]] informed U.S. officials that the raiders had gone to [[Prophetstown (village)|Prophetstown]] in Indiana, headquarters of the anti-American resistance movement led by the [[Tenskwatawa|Shawnee Prophet]] and his brother [[Tecumseh]].&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, 172-73.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with chiefs [[Shabbona]] and [[Waubonsie]], Winamac led the Potawatomi contingent against the Americans at the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]] at Prophetstown in 1811.&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

Winamac began the organization for the 1812 [[siege of Fort Wayne]]. Late in August, Winamac called together a war party from northern Indiana and Michigan. First attempting to convince Captain Rhea of their friendly intent, they sought entry to the post. Rebuffed, on August 28, 1812 the warriors killed a clerk who left the post for the Ohio.  What followed were occasional firing of outbuildings and shots aimed at any and all movement seen from the outside. On September 4, Winamac approached under a flag of truce.  Making no offer, Winamac found the fort susceptible to attack. The next day, two soldiers were killed outside the fort.  Late in the afternoon, Winamac approached the fort with a small delegation and sought admittance to see the commander.  Inside, they were heavily guarded, ending their ploy to kill the commander and attack from inside. The following day, September 6, saw the greatest action in the siege, but without help, the fort could not be taken. On September 11, a relief column under Governor Harrison arrived from Piqua and the siege ended.

After the siege of Fort Wayne, Winamac served as a scout under British Indian agent [[Matthew Elliott (loyalist)|Matthew Elliott]]. On November 22, 1812, Winamac was with a scouting party that captured several Indians, including Shawnee chief Logan ([[Spemica Lawba]]), a U.S. ally. Winamac was killed in an exchange of gunfire when Logan and his companions escaped; Logan died later from his wounds.&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pro-American Winamac===
The "pro-American" Winamek was a chief from the Tippecanoe Potawatomi on the Wabash.  Beginning in 1807 he and [[Five Medals]] and [[Topinabee (I)|Topinabee]] continued to ask the American government for agricultural help.  The equipment that was sent was never used, as only these chiefs were interested in agriculture, not their people.  In 1807, President Monroe wanted to acquire more Indian land.  A council was called at [[Fort Wayne]] in September.  Winamac led the Potawatomi delegation. When the other chiefs and the Miami refused to negotiate land cessions, it was Winamac who persuaded first the Miami and then the Potawatomi to agree to the cession.  When {{convert|3|e6acre|km2}} were agreed to, none were lands of the Potawatomi.  Winamac and the Potawatomi received a generous share of the payment for these lands.  The months following the treaty found Winamac at Detroit settling disputes for the lands in northwest Ohio.  Because of the Fort Wayne Treaty, discontent was growing and the number of warriors at Prophetstown was increasing.  Winamac provide information to Governor Harrison on the plans and activities at Prophetstown.  Harrison invited the Prophet to Washington and in June, Tecumseh led a delegation to Vincennes to meet with Harrison.  Here, [[Tecumseh]] denounced Winamac as a 'black dog' for supporting the American interests.&lt;ref name=McPherson&gt;'''Indian Names in Indiana''' by Alan McPherson, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the winter of 1811-1812, Potawatomi raids were launched against settlements in southern Indiana and Illinois.  To end the destruction, councils where held at [[Cahokia]] and [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]]. Winamac and Five Medals assured the agents that the few anti-American warriors were not representative of the Potawatomi. Because of the influence of the pro-British chiefs, Winamac and Five Medals refused a trip to Washington. Tecumseh the [[Shawnee]] spoke at the council blaming Winamac and Five Medals for not controlling their warriors.  When [[William Henry Harrison|Gov. Harrison]] marched north to [[Prophetstown State Park|Prophetstown]] on the [[Tippecanoe River|Tippecanoe]] in November 1811, Winamac marched with him.  When they were a short march from Prophetstown, Winamac went ahead to talk with the Prophet.  Winamac returned south to meet Harrison, but was on the far side of the Wabash and passed him by.  On the night of November 6, Gov. Harrison encamped for the night, planning on entering Prophetstown the next day.  When the sun rose, the confederacy had surrounded the troops.  The Potawatomi were led by [[Shabbona]] with [[Waubonsie|Waubansee]] and Winamac (2nd another chief among the Potawatomi).  The defeat of the Indian confederacy scattered the tribes to their home villages.  The dispersal of the Indian confederacy did not end the raids among the settlements.  Tension was so bad, even Winamac was warned to stay out of the settlements.  His unfailing support of the Americans would not protect him from harm.&lt;ref name="McPherson"/&gt;

When the war between the United States and England was known, Winamac continued to support the Americans and led a delegation to the Lake Peoria villages seeking the warriors accused of raiding the settlements.  He was ridiculed by the Potawatomi warriors and left unsuccessful. It was Winamac who carried William Hulls orders from Detroit to Fort Dearborn (Chicago) to evacuate, an attack was eminent. Winamac told Commander Heald that they must leave that day to save themselves, this was on August 9. On August 13, an escort of 13 Miami Indians arrived.  On August 15, Mad Sturgeon and Blackbird led the Potawatomi ambush of 500+ warriors against the 62 soldiers and 27 civilians in the dunes of Lake Michigan.  Fifty-three of the Americans died that day. Fifteen of the Indians died.&lt;ref name="McPherson"/&gt; [[Fort Dearborn]] fell on August 15, 1812 to an ambush, then Mackinac. These were followed by the siege of Detroit, which surrendered to the British on August 16.

In September 1817, Winamac and [[Metea]] represented the eastern Potawatomis at the [[treaty of Fort Meigs]], in which they sold lands in Ohio and south central Michigan to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Winamac died in 1821.&lt;ref name="Edmunds, 307n66"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13788">The '''Witches of Warboys''' were Alice Samuel and her family, who were accused of, and executed for [[witchcraft]] between 1589 and 1593 in the village of [[Warboys]], in the [[fens]] of England.&lt;ref name="The Most Strange and Admirable..."&gt;{{cite book|title=The Most Strange and Admirable Discouerie of the Three Witches of Warboys Arraigned, Conuicted, and Executed at the Last Assises at Huntington, for the Bewitching of the Fiue Daughters of Robert Throckmorton Esquire, and Other Persons (1593), Reprint|year=2010|publisher=BiblioBazaar}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of many [[witch trials in the early modern period]], but scholar Barbara Rosen claims it "attracted probably more notice than any other in the sixteenth century".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosen |first=Barbara |title=Witchcraft in England 1558–1618 |location=Amherst |publisher=University  of Massachusetts |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The trials of the witches occurred during the sixteenth century at [[Warboys]] in Huntingdonshire. The first allegations were made in November 1589 by Jane Throckmorton, the 10-year-old daughter of Robert Throckmorton the [[Squire]] of Warboys when she started suffering from fits (see Initial Allegations below). She accused the 76-year-old Alice Samuel of being the cause; this was echoed by Jane’s four sisters and some household servants who began exhibiting similar symptoms. When Alice Samuel was brought forward to the children, they became more ill and had the urge to scratch her.{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=For all the information in the paragraph}}

Robert Throckmorton was a close friend of [[Henry Williams (alias Cromwell)|Sir Henry Cromwell]], one of the wealthiest commoners in England and the grandfather of [[Oliver Cromwell]].  In March 1590, Lady Cromwell came to Warboys to visit. At the Throckmorton house, she interviewed Alice Samuel and what came after the interview served to confirm the suspicions the Throckmortons had. Lady Cromwell was tormented by Alice Samuel in her dreams, and after some time she became ill and died (buried 1592). This was enough proof to put Alice Samuel through a trial that would find her and the rest of her family guilty.{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=For all the information in the paragraph}}

==Initial allegations==

===Throckmorton family===
The first allegations declaring Alice as a practitioner of witchcraft were made in November 1589.  Following this, there were a total of twelve maid-servants of the Throckmorton household (in addition to the five daughters) who experienced fits and the torment of Alice Samuell’s witchcraft. Jane’s fits were described as such: "Sometimes she would neese [sneeze] very loud and thick for the space of half an hour together; and evidently as one in a great trance and sound lay quietly as long, soon after would begin to swell and heave up her belly so as none was able to bend her or keep her down, sometime thee would shake one leg and no other part of her, as if the palsie had been in it, sometimes the other, presently she would shake one of her arms and then the other, and soon after her head, as if she had been infected with the running palsie".&lt;ref name="Anonymous 1593"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anonymous |title=The most strange and admirable discouerie of the three Witches of Warboys |location=London |year=1593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jane's mother and grandmother were by the child’s side while other neighbors came to see her. When Alice Samuel came in, the child proclaimed: "Grandmother look where the old witch sitteth (pointing to Samuell) did you ever see one more like a witch than she is: Take off her black thrumbed [shaggy or fringed] cap, for I cannot abide to look on her". Jane's mother  thought nothing of this at first, thinking her child was sleep deprived and sick.  However, because Jane continued to get worse, her parents sent her urine to Doctor Barrow of Cambridge, who sent medicine to Jane three separate times thinking it would heal her.  It did not.  After the third time, the Doctor inquired whether there were any signs of sorcery or witchcraft involved that the parents could see. Jane’s urine was then sent to a family acquaintance, Master Butler, for examination and he sent back the same remedies that Doctor Barrow had sent. Exactly a month later, on the same day almost to the hour, two more of Master Throckmorton’s daughters fell sick to the same illness  that was afflicting Jane.&lt;ref name="Anonymous 1593"/&gt;

These daughters, two to three years older than Jane, cried out: "Take her away, look where she standeth here before us in a black thrumbed cap it is she that hath bewitched us and she will kill us if you do not take her away".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anonymous |title=The most strange and admirable discovery of the three Witches of Warboys |location=London |year=1593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parents were then worried, but could not understand why any such harm would come to them, for they had only moved into the town the "Michaelmas before" (September 29, 1588).{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=quotation}} Their youngest daughter, nine years old, fell sick less than a month later. Soon after this, the oldest daughter, fifteen years old, fell sick. She was sickest out of the five. Both cried out against Alice Samuell. Their eldest sister, having been the strongest, strived with the spirit, and was grievously tortured not being able to overcome it. This caused her to "(neefe), screech and groan very fearfully, sometimes it would heave up her belly and bounce up her body with such violence that she was not kept upon her bed".{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=quotation}}   When sitting in a chair, her fits often caused her to break that chair.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The daughters could not see, hear or feel while in these fits. They accused Mother Samuell, asking for her to be taken away. These fits would sometimes last for half a day and happened up to six or seven times a day.  They believed that God freed them of this [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] and afterwards, the sisters remembered nothing of what they had been saying.{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=For all the information in the paragraph}}

===Lady Cromwell===
In March 1590, Lady Cromwell and Alice had a discussion regarding the accusations made against Alice.  During this conversation, Lady Cromwell reportedly grabbed a pair of [[scissors]] and cut a lock of hair off Alice, and gave it to Mrs. Throckmorton to burn (a [[folk tradition|folk]] remedy believed to weaken a witch's power). That night, Lady Cromwell had nightmares, became ill and later died in 1592.&lt;ref name="Luke Matin"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Matin |first1=Luke |title=The Witch Trials – Witches of Warboys Witch Trials |url=http://www.witchcraftandwitches.com/trials_warboys.html|publisher=Luke Matin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
Following the death of Lady Cromwell, a local parson convinced Alice to admit to witchcraft, which she retracted the very next day.  However, she confessed again when she was brought before the [[Bishop of Lincoln]], and taken to [[Huntingdon]] where she was imprisoned with her daughter and husband.  The family was tried in April 1593 for the murder by witchcraft of Lady Cromwell. Alice’s words to Lady Cromwell ("Madam, why do you use me thus? I never did you any harm as yet") were used against her at the trial, and all three were found guilty and eventually hanged.&lt;ref name="The Most Strange and Admirable..." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Luke Matin" /&gt;

==Posthumous proof==
The jailer and his wife examined the corpses.
{{quote|[H]e found upon the body of the old woman Alice Samuel a little lump of flesh, in manner sticking out as if it had been a teat, to the length of half an inch; which both he and his wife perceiving, at the first sight thereof meant not to disclose because it was adjoining so secret a place which was not decent to be seen. Yet in the end, not willing to conceal so strange a matter, and decently covering that privy place a little above which it grew, they made open show thereof unto diverse that stood by.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Witch in History: Early Modern and Twentieth-Century Representations |first=Diane |last=Purkiss |publisher=Routledge |year=2013|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Historian Jim Kermode argues that the discovery of a [[witches' mark]] (also known as a "devil's mark") was important legal proof at this period in England. "[I]t gradually became accepted that the mark, with women, most commonly took the form of a teat-like growth in the pudenda".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kermode |first=J.I. |last2=Walker |first2=Garthine |title=Women, crime and the courts in early modern England |date=1994 |publisher=UCL Press |location=London |isbn=1857281403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This tale of the jailer's postmortem examination has been widely quoted in modern scholarship, for example with reference to the animal/human divide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Creager |editor-first=Angela N.H. |last=Jordan|first=William Chester |title=The animal-human boundary: historical perspectives |date=2002 |publisher=University of Rochester Press |location=Rochester, N.Y |isbn=9781580461207 |page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "sado-erotic fascination of the witches' teat",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Words like daggers: violent female speech in early modern England |date=2015 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=[S.l.] |isbn=978-0-8032-5488-6 |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; and particularly in [[feminist interpretations of the Early Modern witch trials]]. It is also cited by writers such as [[Lynn Picknett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Picknett |first1=Lynn |title=The secret history of Lucifer: the ancient path to knowledge and the real Da Vinci code |date=2005 |publisher=Robinson |location=London |isbn=978-1845292638 |edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The scholar [[George Lyman Kittredge|George Kittredge]] (1860–1941) called the Warboys trial "the most momentous witch-trial that had ever occurred in England", partially because it had "demonstrably produced a deep and lasting impression on the class that made laws". He makes a case that the Warboys trial influenced the passage of the [[Witchcraft Acts#Witchcraft Act 1604|Witchcraft Act of 1604]].

Following the hangings, Robert Throckmorton left Warboys hastily, his wife allegedly dying shortly before his departure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=DeWindt |first=Anne |title=Witchcraft and Conflicting Visions of the Ideal Village Community |journal=Journal of British Studies |volume=34 |year=1995 |pages=427–463}} JSTOR.
