An '''articled clerk'''  is someone who is studying to either be an accountant or a lawyer. In doing so they are put under the supervision of someone already in the profession, usually for two years. This can be compared as being an intern for a company; the only difference is once the two years is over the trainee becomes the trainer.  Trainees are obligated to sign a contract agreeing to the terms of being an articled clerk. The articled clerk signs a contract, known as "articles of clerkship", committing to a fixed period of employment. ''Wharton's Law Lexicon'' defines an articled clerk as "a pupil of a solicitor, who undertakes, by articles of clerkship, continuing covenants, mutually binding, to instruct him in the principles and practice of the profession".{{sfn|Burrill|1859|p=134}} The contract is with a specific [[partnership|partner]] in the firm and not with the firm as a whole.

Apprentice [[architect]]s can also be articled. [[Henry Percy Adams (architect)|Henry Percy Adams]] articled to Britwen Binyon (1846&amp;ndash;1909), architect.&lt;ref name=adamspainter&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.suffolkartists.co.uk/index.cgi?choice=painter&amp;pid=15 |title=ADAMS, (Harry) Percy |publisher=www.suffolkartists.co.uk |date= |accessdate=October 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== India ==
In India, the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of India]] undergo an articleship programme for a period of 3/3.5 years as the case may be, CA Students after clearing CA-IPCC/Intermediate/Inter Group 1 or Both Group are required to registered himself with a partner of a CA Firm duly registered with the Institute. Those Students during the period of articleship are also known as Articled Clerk.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Sri Lanka ==
In Sri Lanka, student members of the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka]] are required to serve as a clerk serving under articles with a member of the Institute in practice or with a member of the Institute who is a salaried employee in the service of a firm of accountants for a minimum three-year practical training period. They are known as Articled clerks during this period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.casrilanka.com/casl/images/pdf/members/parliament_act.pdf Act of Incorporation And Regulations Of The Institute Of Chartered Accountants Of Sri Lanka]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Asia Commons''' is an attempt to see how ideas of the [[Commons]] are specifically applicable to [[Asia]]n conditions, and may be distinctive from other forms.

It is also the name of a conference, held in early June 2006 in [[Bangkok]], the capital in [[Thailand]].  The event was attended by over a hundred people, mostly from Asia.

==The Concept of an 'Asia Commons'==

There are some theses on why the [[Commons]] idea in Asia would be different from those elsewhere. For example: 
* common village land is still in existence in Asia, not in the West;
* the problems of access are more serious in most Asian countries;
* unauthorized copying/sharing of software, music and audio CDs or DVDs is more common than in the West.
 
More specifically, the term Asia Commons is the movement to create and sustain the Commons in Asia.

== The Commons, as a concept ==

There are many type of commons, but the focus could be divided basically into two—natural resources, and man-made resources.

The commons is: 
* any common resource that is available to all (but can be defined locally, or specifically as 'everybody in category x')
* a series of specific institutional formats used to manage such
* the movement that promotes them.

The open/free, [[participatory]]/p2p, and commons are a related the three-legged stool of paradigms: 
* ''Free and open'' - ensures access to the raw material to build the common
* ''Participatory'' - refers to the process of broad participation in order to actually build it
* The commons is the ''institutional format'' - used to prevent private appropriation of said creations
* ''Cyclical'' - The circle is closed when commons-generated material is again free/open raw material for the next cycle of the circulation of the commons.

==The Asia Commons Conference: June 6–8, 2006==

Asia Commons, or the Asian Conference on the Digital Commons, was a conference held between June 6 to 8, 2006 in Bangkok, Thailand. Its website says that during the past two decades, the "''level, scope, territorial extent, and role of copyrights and patents have expanded into new sectors, often without development considerations''".&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20070928191031/http://www.asia-commons.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference discussed issues pertaining to the Asian Digital Commons, [[free software|Free/Libre and Open Source Software]], business models and collaborative models, Intellectual Property Rights, patents, copyrights, copylefts, the grey economy and its impact on the Asian "developing world", ideas of the Creative Commons, alternate law practices, [[A2K|access to knowledge (a2k)]], Open Access, open alternatives, peer-to-peer (P2P) practices and open standards.

===Goal, purpose===

The Asia Commons event was aimed at creating "many opportunities where deep discussions and exchange can happen". The conference organisers said they "recognise that all participants have experience and ideas that are relevant and as a result, expect them to contribute to the discussions on issues and topics of interest."

Organisers said (in a conference kit presented to participants) that through an exchange of experience and knowledge, the Asia Commons conference aimed at bringing participants together to:

* Increase understanding of the effects of copyrights and patents, specially software patents, on access to knowledge and culture in Asia.
* Conceptualise locally-relevant models for collaborative creation and dissemination of knowledge and culture.
* Enhance partnerships to build collaboration through collaborative projects.
* Identify information gaps and further areas of research.
* Contribute towards the production of material for wider dissemination and decision-making.

===Participation===

Some 137 participants were listed to take part in the event. They came in from a range of countries from Asia ([[Bangladesh]], [[Cambodia]], China, [[Hong Kong]] (PRC), India, [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Mongolia]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]], [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]],  [[Sri Lanka]], [[Taiwan]], [[Thailand]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Vietnam]]) and beyond (Australia, [[Brazil]], Canada, [[Chile]], [[Ecuador]], [[Fiji]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Ghana]], Israel, [[Kenya]], [[Malawi]], [[South Africa]], [[Uganda]], UK, the United States, [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]]).

===Speakers===

Some of the speakers included [[Peter Drahos]] of the [[Australian National University]] and [[James Love (NGO director)|Jamie Love]] of the [[Consumer Project on Technology]], both of whom were joint keynote speakers. [[Bangalore]] based lawyer of the [http://www.altlawforum.org Alternate Law Forum] [https://web.archive.org/web/20060822150554/http://wikis.bellanet.org/asia-commons/index.php/Lawrence_Liang Lawrence Liang], independent writer and researcher [https://web.archive.org/web/20060822205601/http://wikis.bellanet.org/asia-commons/index.php/Vijayalakshmi_Balakrishnan Vijayalakshmi Balakrishnan] of New Delhi, [https://web.archive.org/web/20060822090910/http://wikis.bellanet.org/asia-commons/index.php/Dr._N.S._Gopalakrishanan Dr N.S.

The participatory spectogram session on "Patents and Innovation" included as keynote speakers, FOSS advocate [https://web.archive.org/web/20060822150841/http://wikis.bellanet.org/asia-commons/index.php/Fouad_Riaz_Bajwa Fouad Riaz Bajwa] of [https://web.archive.org/web/20060804082653/http://fossfp.org/ Free and Open Source Foundation of Pakistan (FOSSFP)] and advocate [https://web.archive.org/web/20060614153420/http://wikis.bellanet.org/asia-commons/index.php/Rahul_Matthan Rahul Matthan] of [[Trilegal]], India with the session led by [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20110718234259/http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-63152-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html Laurent Elder] of [[International Development Research Centre|IDRC]].

There were sessions on "History of the Commons, Evolution of Copyright and the Emergence of the Digital Economy: Exploring the Relationships", "Copyright and the Information Grey Economy: A Regional Comparison", "Patents and Innovation", and "Open Business Models".

Using the "speed sharing" model, there was also a session on collaborative projects. Each speaker, talked to small groups of participants, and had just three minutes in which to explain their work and concepts. This was followed by a session of 'round tables' on the issue of collaborative models: factors that lead to successful collaborations, opportunities and challenges.

Towards the end, the focus shifted to building an overview of the Asia Commons—ideas and issues, issues and opportunities, what could be done to move forward, and what is being moved forward.

===Organisers===

This event was organised at the Chaophya Park Hotel and organised by [[Bellanet|Bellanet International Secretariat]], the Delhi-based [[Centre for Science, Development and Media Studies (CSDMS)]], [[South Asia Partnership International]], and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] [[Asia Pacific Development Information Programme]]'s [[International Open Source Network]] (IOSN).

This event was financially supported by the [[International Development Research Centre|International Development Research Centre (IDRC)]] of Canada and UNDP APDIP's [[International Open Source Network]] (IOSN). Local partners in organising the event were the [[Asian Institute of Technology]] based in Bangkok and the [[Thai Rural Net]] (TRN).

It was a [[Global Knowledge Partnership]] (GKP) members' event.

===Open Space===

This event used the 'open space' approach to focus on issues of relevance.

As defined [[Open Space Technology|elsewhere]] in the Wikipedia: "Open Space Technology enables groups of any size to address complex, important issues and achieve meaningful results quickly. It is at its best where more traditional meeting formats fail: when there is conflict, complexity, diversity of thought or people and short decision times. It has been used in widely diverse settings, from designing airplane doors at a large airplane manufacturing company to engaging street kids in defining a sustainable jobs program. Originated by Harrison Owen in 1986, Open Space has been used in over 100 countries and in diverse settings, industries, cultures and situations - for program and product design, knowledge exchange, interdisciplinary thinking, conflict resolution and conferences."

Organisers of the event were quoted as saying that [https://web.archive.org/web/20071020234236/http://www.asia-commons.net/asiaopenspace they had doubts] whether the Open Space approach would be suitable in Asia. But it was.

===Emergent issues ===

One of the issues to emerge from the meeting was a regional (Asia-wide) focus on  Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS, or FOSS). Diosdado "Dong" Calmada of the Philippines held a session with this concern. He was keen to look at why Asia had so many GNU/Linux user groups, but seldom seemed to  care about the big picture. This region, he suggested, was too concerned about its own technical problems. "There's a need to broaden the perspective of our groups. After all, LUGs (Linux-user groups) are potent forces," he was quoted as saying. It was felt that Asia, with all its tech skills and software talent, is all but invisible in the world of Free Software and Open Source. People do not link up with one another, within countries or across borders. There's little communication happening within the otherwise successful FOSS movement across this vast continent.

[[Michel Bauwens]] of the [http://www.p2pfoundation.net P2PFoundation], which has a wide variety of links to P2P or peer-to-peer networking examples, explained his perspective saying, "The basic idea I had was that there's a new social movement emerging, which is really about extending the realm of participation to the whole of life. We live in a representative democracy, which says you can vote every four years, and choose which people who exercise power on your behalf... now we're building tools and resources which say everybody needs to be involved, and everybody should have a voice (in other areas too, apart from just voting)."

[[Paola di Maio]], another participant, narrated her experiences in deploying technology to cope with the fury of nature, as reflected in the December 26, 2004 [[Asian tsunami]]. She commented: "Our emergency collaboration model emerged after we became familiar with the tsunami. I was in Thailand then. My internet was working but all the phone were down. So I got online via my tiny mobile, and was looking for information. We knew something big had happened, but there was simply no news emerging. One or two hours after the wave hit, there were headlines reporting an 'earthquake'."

Sacha of [[Indymedia]] in the US shared his group's experience with building alternatives from the grassroots. Currently, the [[Indymedia]] global network of participatory journalism has local units in 160 cities in 80 countries, and every continent. He said: "Indymedia was created in 1999 to cover the WTO ([[World Trade Organization|World Trade Organisation]]) Ministerial and protests against it in Seattle. There were some 5000 activists taking part. Many strands from the [[Global Justice Movement]] joined in."

[[Lawrence Liang]], a lawyer trained at the prestigious [[National Law School of India]], had a session along with others on "countering IP propaganda". [[Ronaldo Lemos]] from [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s [[Fundação Getúlio Vargas]] school of law referred to [[Yochai Benkler]]'s book, ''[[The Wealth of Networks]]''. He also pointed to [[Jimmy Wales]], who has said that in the foreseeable future there would be 12 fields that would become free. These things are: the encyclopedia, the dictionary, academic curriculum, music, art in general, file formats, maps, product identifiers, search engines, production made by communities, TV listings, academic publishing. [[Ronaldo Lemos]] felt that things lacking in this list included news and software.

Said Delhi-based independent writer and researcher Vijayalakshmi "Viju" Balakrishnan: "In Asia, the history of (colonial) trade has largely been sea-based trade. And the language and philosophy now governing the way cyberspace is being controlled has strong parallels to what we saw in the seventeenth century. Free trade has functioned through pirate-based models. There were cartels or guild-power. For us in India it was the East India Company. For our friends in South East Asia, it was the VOC or the Dutch East India Company. Today, it is the Wintel (Windows-Intel) combo. In comparison to the state-control model of the past, we now have the story of how Google enters China."

A number of other issues also emerged from the conference, which are aptly captured in the conference [https://web.archive.org/web/20060813091257/http://access5.bellanet.org/asia-commons.net/arc/participants discussion list], [http://wikis.bellanet.org/asia-commons wiki]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} and multiple blogs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11913">{{about|authority as a concept of political philosophy||}}

'''Authority''' is the [[Legitimacy (political)|right]] to exercise [[Power (social and political)|power]], which can be formalized by a [[State (polity)|state]] and exercised by way of judges, appointed executives of government, or the ecclesiastical or priestly appointed representatives of a God or other [[deity|deities]]. 

A governing body may be labelled an authority e.g. the [[Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority]] or the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]]. ''Authority'' can also mean the right to complete an action or execute an order.

In [[government]], ''authority'' is often used interchangeably with ''power''. However, their meanings differ: while ''power'' is the ability to order or accomplish a goal or to influence others, ''authority'' refers to a claim of [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]], the justification and right to exercise that power. For example, while a [[Crowd|mob]] may have the power to punish a criminal by beating or [[lynching]], the [[rule of law]] indicates that only a [[court]] of law has the authority to determine and refer a criminal for punishment. In this sense, authority is a matter of not only the ability or power to [[Decision-making|make decisions]], but the right to make these decisions and execute them with commensurate power. Appropriate authority is the basis of good government in the [[Republicanism|republican]] conception of government, which finds much of its theoretical origins in [[ancient Rome]].

== History ==
[[Ancient history|Ancient]] understandings of authority trace back to [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and draw later from Catholic ([[Thomism|Thomistic]]) thought and other [[Tradition|traditional]] understandings. In more modern terms, forms of authority include transitional authority exhibited in for example [[Cambodia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC)|last=Widyono|first=Benny|date=Oct 2014|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; public authority in the form of [[Popular Power|popular power]], and, in more administrative terms, bureaucratic or managerial techniques. In terms of bureaucratic governance, one limitation of the governmental agents of the executive branch, as outlined by George A. Krause, is that they are not as close to the popular will as elected representatives are.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Legislative Delegation of Authority to Bureaucratic Agencies|last=Krause|first=George A.|date=2010|work=The Oxford Handbook of American Bureaucracy|access-date=|publisher=Oxford University Press|editor-last=Durant|editor-first=Robert F.|location=New York, NY|page=524}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claims of authority can extend to national or individual [[sovereignty]], which is broadly or provisionally understood as a claim to political authority that is [[Legitimation|legitimated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Sovereignty|last=Glanville|first=Luke|date=|work=The Oxford Handbook of the Responsibility to Protect|access-date=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|editor-last=Bellamy|editor-first=Alex J.|location=New York, NY|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Historical applications of authority in political terms include the formation of the city-state of [[Geneva]], and experimental treatises involving the topic of authority in relation to education include ''[[Emile, or On Education|Emile]]'' by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. As David Laitin defines, authority is a key concept to be defined in determining the range and role of political theory, science and inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laitin|first=David|date=1998|title=Toward a Political Science Discipline: Authority Patterns Revisited|url=|journal=Comparative Political Studies|volume=31|issue=4|pages=423-443|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relevance of a grounded understanding of authority includes the basic foundation and formation of political, civil and/or ecclesiastical institutions or representatives. In recent years, however, authority in political contexts has been challenged or questioned.

== Political philosophy ==
There have been several contributions to the debate of [[political authority]]. Among others, [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Alexandre Kojève]] and [[Carl Schmitt]] have provided some of the most remarkable texts.

In [[political philosophy]], the jurisdiction of political authority, the location of [[sovereignty]], the balancing of freedom and authority,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hegel on Freedom and Authority|last=Cristi|first=Renato|publisher=University of Wales Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=Cardiff, Wales|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the requirements of political obligations have been core questions from the time of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] to the present. Most [[democracy|democratic]] societies are engaged in an ongoing discussion regarding the legitimate extent of the exercise of [[government]]al authority. In the [[United States]], for instance, there is a prevailing belief that the political system as instituted by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] should accord the populace as much freedom as reasonable, and that government should limit its authority accordingly, known as [[limited government]].

In the discussion regarding the legitimacy of political authority, there are two beliefs at the respective ends of the spectrum. The first is the belief in the absolute freedom of the individual, otherwise known as [[Philosophical anarchism|political anarchism]]. The second is the belief that there must be a central authority in the form of a sovereign that claims ownership and control over the masses. This belief is known as [[statism]]. Sovereignty, in modern terms, can refer either to the adherence to a form of sovereign rule or the individual sovereignty, or autonomy, of a nation-state. The argument for political anarchy and anti-statism is made by [[Michael Huemer]] in his book ''[[The Problem of Political Authority]]''. On the other side, one of the main arguments for the legitimacy of the state is some form of the “[[Social contract|social contract theory]]” developed by [[Thomas Hobbes]] in his 1668 book, [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|''Leviathan'']], or by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in his political writings on [[The Social Contract|the social contract]]. 

== Sociology ==
Since the emergence of the [[social sciences]], authority has become a subject of research in a variety of [[empirical]] settings: the family (parental authority), small groups (informal authority of [[leadership]]), intermediate organizations such as schools, churches, armies, industries and bureaucracies (organizational and bureaucratic authorities), and society-wide or inclusive organizations, ranging from the most primitive tribal society to the modern nation-state and intermediate organization (political authority).

The definition of authority in contemporary social science remains a matter of debate. [[Max Weber]] in his essay "[[Politics as a Vocation]]" (1919) divided legitimate authority into [[Authority (sociology)|three types]]. Others, like [[Howard Bloom]], suggest a parallel between authority and [[Veneration of the dead|respect/reverence for ancestors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| quote                 = To validate an argument, we refer back to our ancestors - or to someone who, while still alive, has already garnered the sort of authority only ancestors normally have.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== The United States ==
The understanding of political authority and the exercise of [[Political power in the United States over time|political powers]] in the American context traces back to the writings of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]], including the arguments put forward in ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' by [[James Madison]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] and the First Chief Justice of the United States [[John Jay]], and later speeches by the 16th President of the United States [[Abraham Lincoln]]. "Our government rests in public opinion," President Abraham Lincoln said in 1856 Related to the Authority of the Sanatana Kingdom .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lincoln Speeches|last=Guelzo|first=Allen C.|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1854 Speech at Peoria, Illinois, Lincoln espoused "the proposition that each man should do precisely as he pleases with all which is exclusively his own," a principle existing "at the foundation of the sense of justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lincoln Speeches|last=Guelzo|first=Allen C.|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sense of personal ownership and stewardship was integral to the practice of [[Limited government|self-government]] as Abraham Lincoln saw it by a [[Republicanism|Republican]] nation and its people. This was because, as Abraham Lincoln also declared, "No man is good enough to govern another man, without that other's consent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lincoln Speeches|last=Guelzo|first=Allen C.|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2576">A '''ballot measure''' is a piece of proposed [[legislation]] to be approved or rejected by eligible [[voter]]s. Ballot measures are also known as "propositions" or simply "questions".

Ballot measures differ from most legislation passed by [[representative democracies]]; ordinarily, an [[election|elected]] [[legislature]] develops and passes laws. Ballot measures, by contrast, are an example of [[direct democracy]].

In the [[United States]] ballot measures may be established by several different processes which vary amongst the states:&lt;ref&gt;[[Initiative &amp; Referendum Institute]] (2013). [http://www.iandrinstitute.org/Quick%20Fact%20-%20What%20is%20I&amp;R.htm What are ballot propositions, initiatives, and referendums?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725175114/http://www.iandrinstitute.org/Quick%20Fact%20-%20What%20is%20I%26R.htm |date=2010-07-25 }}. USC.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Initiative]], in which any citizen or organization may gather a predetermined number of [[signature]]s to qualify a measure for the [[ballot]];
* [[Popular referendum]], in which a predetermined number of signatures (typically lower than the number required for an initiative) qualifies a ballot measure repealing a specific act of the legislature;
* [[Legislative referral]] (a.k.a. "legislative referendum"), in which the legislature puts proposed legislation up for popular vote (either voluntarily or, in the case of a [[constitutional amendment]] as a required procedure).
[[File:MedicaidForIdahoVan.jpg|thumb|A [[Initiative|initiative]] [[canvassing]] campaign, Medicaid for Idaho, to put [[Medicaid]] expansion on the ballot; the [[Methodism|Methodist]] [[Cathedral of the Rockies]] hosted the [[volunteering|volunteers&lt;ref name="In This Red State, Progressives Are Taking Matters Into Their Own Hands"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/in-this-red-state-progressives-are-taking-matters-into-their-own-hands_us_5aadb598e4b0337adf8449fa |title=In This Red State, Progressives Are Taking Matters Into Their Own Hands Amateur activists, sick of being ignored by the GOP, are fighting to cover the uninsured. |last=Young |first=Jeffrey |date=2018-03-21 |website=Huffington Post |access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]]]

In [[Switzerland]], same kind of ballot measures are known as ''[[votations]]''.

The term '''break/fix''' refers to the fee-for-service method of providing [[information technology]] (IT) services to businesses.  Using this method an IT solution provider performs services as needed and bills the customer only for the work done.  The service may include repairs, upgrades or installation of systems, components, peripheral equipment, networking or software.

The alternative to break/fix is '''managed services''', which is a [[service plan]], where the customer pays a fixed amount for services covered in the plan and pays additional amounts for repairs or other work which is not covered in the plan. 

The equivalent practice in the consumer market is that of out-of-warranty appliances, where the customer can pay for repairs as needed (break/fix) or they can buy an [[extended warranty]] (managed services).

'''Advantages:'''

Possible lower cost (at first).

'''Disadvantages:'''

Since problems are only addressed when they arise, maintenance is reactive rather than proactive.  Small problems left unaddressed due to shortsightedness because of cost can balloon to major failures.

Unscrupulous providers are incentivized to use inefficient or malicious means to increase break/fix work and thus increase their revenue.

The [[Anglican Communion]] as a whole, unlike the [[Roman Catholic Church]], does not have a centralised [[canon law]] of its own.{{sfn|Skyes|Booty|1988|p=206}}  Each of the autonomous member churches of the communion, however, does have a canonical system.  Some, such as the [[Church of England]] have an ancient, highly developed [[Canon law (Church of England)|canon law]] while others, such as the [[Episcopal Church in the United States]] have more recently developed canonical systems originally based on the English canon law.

'''Ceremonial marriage''' is a common form of [[marriage]] in which a couple follows laws and procedures specified by the state in order to gain recognition of their marriage (ex. buying a [[marriage license]], participating in a ceremony led by an authorized official, having witnesses at a ceremony). They are often accompanied by [[wedding]]s, and have different forms, reflecting particular religious and philosophical views of the couple.

Ceremonial marriage is an opposite to [[common-law marriage]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2548">A '''certificate of public convenience and necessity''' or '''certificate of public convenience''' is a type of [[regulatory compliance]] certification for [[public service]] industries. [[Private companies]] wishing to provide essential public services in certain countries must be granted a CPCN before constructing facilities and offering services.

==Philippines==
In the Philippines, a certificate of public convenience (CPC) is required for private provision of public services for which no franchise, either municipal or legislative, is required by law, such as a [[common carrier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.batasnatin.com/law-library/mercantile-law/transportation-laws/2218-certificate-of-public-convenience-cpc.html|title=What is a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC)?|work= Philippine Law Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
The first [[U.S. state]] statutes for certificate of public convenience (CPCN) were issued in 1870, and the [[U.S. Congress]] included a certification provision in [[U.S. federal law]] in the [[Transportation Act of 1920]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/1121802?sid=21105515254613&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4|title=Origins of the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity: Developments in the States, 1870 - 1920|last=Jones|first=William K.|journal=[[Columbia Law Review]]|volume=79|number=3|pages=426–516|doi=10.2307/1121802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of industries requiring a CPCN from a U.S. state include the provision of [[telecommunications]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.dps.ny.gov/W/PSCWeb.nsf/All/C78F4BE884AA2FA885257687006F3964?OpenDocument|title=CPCN: Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity|publisher=[[New York State Public Service Commission]]|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; transportation of [[natural gas]] in [[Alaska]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/720a|title=15 U.S. Code § 720a - Issuance of certificate of public convenience and necessity|work=[[Legal Information Institute]]|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a range of public services in [[Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/fulltext.asp?DocName=022000050K8-406|title= Illinois Compiled Statutes: Sec. 8-406.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5189">In [[consumer rights]] legislation and practice, a '''cooling-off period''' is a period of time following a purchase when the purchaser may choose to cancel a purchase, and [[returning|return goods]] which have been supplied, for any reason, and obtain a full refund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/ago/consumer-resources/consumer-information/retail-rights/cancel-a-sale.html|title=Cooling-Off Periods, Right to Cancel a Sale|author=[[Martha Coakley]]|publisher=Attorney General of Massachusetts|accessdate=2013-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laws==
Many nations have passed laws that create cooling off periods for specific transactions, although the conditions under which they may apply and the transactions covered by the laws varies significantly by jurisdiction. For example, within the United States, the federal government imposes 72-hour cooling down periods for many consumer transactions completed at home or away from the seller's traditional place of business.&lt;ref name=lars&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=How Can You Get Out of a Contract|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/canceling-contracts|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=16 March 2018|date=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many U.S. states impose versions of those cooling down period laws, and offer similar laws for an additional range of transactions, such as time share purchases and health club contracts.&lt;ref name=lars/&gt; For example, California provides cooling-off periods for many consumer transactions, including insurance purchases, car warranties, dental services, and weight-loss services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blaine|first1=Tristan|title=Contract Cancellation periods or “Cooling off periods”|url=http://la.lawsoup.org/legal-guides/laws-by-role/consumer/contract-cancellation-cooling-off-periods/|website=LawSoup LA|publisher=Law Offices of Tristan D. Blaine|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Union]] allows residents of member states to seek refunds for goods and services purchased outside of a shop, such as by telephone, mail order or in response to a door-to-door sales pitch, to cancel the transaction, return any purchase and obtain a refund within fourteen days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guarantees and returns|url=https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/consumers/shopping/guarantees-returns/index_en.htm|website=Your Europe|publisher=European Union|accessdate=16 March 2018|date=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Refund policies ==
Although not technically cooling off periods, many retailers voluntarily grant purchasers a defined period of time during which they may return products that have not been damaged and remain in salable condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collins|first1=Kelvin|title=Refunds and Exchanges: What to Know Before You Go Shopping|url=https://www.bbb.org/central-georgia/news-events/news-releases/2017/12/refunds-and-exchanges-what-to-know-before-you-go-shopping/|website=Better Business Bureau|accessdate=16 March 2018|date=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some jurisdictions require retailers to offer return policies. For example, in the European Union the [[Consumer Rights Directive]] of 2011 obliges [[Member state of the European Union|member states]] to give purchasers the right to return goods or cancel services purchased from a business away from a normal commercial premises, such as [[e-commerce|online]], [[mail order]], or [[door-to-door]], with limited exceptions, within two weeks or one year if the seller did not clearly inform the purchaser of their rights from the receipt of the goods, for a full refund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-11-450_en.htm?locale=en|title=Consumer Rights: 10 ways the new EU Consumer Rights Directive will give people stronger rights when they shop online|publisher=[[European Commission]]|date=2011-06-23|accessdate=2013-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Consumer Rights Directive is implemented in the [[United Kingdom]] by the Consumer Contracts (information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013.

== Experimental economics ==
The effects of cooling-off periods have been studied in [[experimental economics]] in the context of the so-called [[ultimatum game]]. In this game, one party makes an offer to divide a pie (say, 10 dollars). Then another party can accept or reject the offer. When the offer (say, 8 dollars for the first party and 2 dollars for the second party) is accepted, the parties get the respective payments. When the offer is rejected, both parties get zero. Cooling-off periods can reduce the rejection rates of unfair offers when the parties perceive the stakes to be large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oechssler|first=Jörg|last2=Roider|first2=Andreas|last3=Schmitz|first3=Patrick W.|date=2015|title=Cooling Off in Negotiations: Does it Work?|url=https://doi.org/10.1628/093245615X14307212950056|journal=Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics JITE|language=en|volume=171|issue=4|pages=565–588|doi=10.1628/093245615x14307212950056|issn=0932-4569|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2529">'''Correlative''' ("corelative," UK spelling) is the term adopted by [[Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld]] to describe the philosophical relationships between fundamental legal concepts in [[jurisprudence]].

== Hohfeldian analysis ==

Hohfeld was concerned that there was some ambiguity in the explanation of the similarities and differences between concepts in law. Hence, with the focus on the nature of ''rights'', he proposed a system of analysis based on "jural correlatives" and "jural opposites". A correlative is where two concepts are [[logically consistent]] and the one necessarily implies the other. When two concepts are Hohfeldian opposites (technically, logical contradictions), they are mutually exclusive.

Thus, if A has a right with regard to B, an analysis of their relationship from B's point of view must imply that B has a duty to A. An owner of land may hold four distinct entitlements: rights, privileges, powers, and immunities. Hohfeld linked each entitlement to a corelative and its opposite:

{| style="width:250px; height:200px" border="1"
|- 
| '''Elements'''
| '''Correlatives'''
| '''Opposites'''
|- style="height:100px" 
| Right
| style="width:250px" |Duty
| No Right
|-
| Privilege or Liberty
| No Right
| Duty

| style="width:250px" |Liability
| Disability
|- style="height:100px" 
| Immunity
| style="width:250px" |Disability
| Liability
|-
|-
|}

==In practice==
Jurists such as [[Mickey Dias]] and [[Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld#Hohfeldian analysis|Hohfeld]] have declared that rights and duties are ''jural corelatives'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dias |title=Jurisprudence |year=1976 |first=Reginald Walter Michael |oclc=2668655 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which means that if someone has a right, ''someone else'' owes a duty to him. This reasoning of Dias' was used in ''[[Murphy v Brentwood DC|Murphy v Brentwood District Council]]'' (1991) to disapprove  [[Alfred Denning|Lord Denning]] [[Master of the Rolls|MR]]'s judgment in ''[[Dutton v Bognor Regis UDC|Dutton v Bognor Regis Urban District Council]]'' (1972).&lt;ref&gt;Denning had argued, wrongly, that when a local council has a right to inspect a building under construction, the council has a corresponding duty of care to "inspect properly".&lt;/ref&gt;

In The [[United States]] [[criminal justice system]], a '''Courtroom Workgroup''' is an informal arrangement between a criminal [[prosecutor]], [[criminal defense attorney]], and the [[judicial officer]]. This foundational concept in the academic discipline of [[criminal justice]] recharacterizes the seemingly adversarial courtroom participants as collaborators in "doing justice." The courtroom workgroup was proposed by Eisenstein and Jacob in 1977 to explain their observations of the ways courts, especially lower level courts, actually come to decisions.

Because the courtroom workgroup deviates from the public consensus of how justice works, it has developed a deviant set of rules to continue its work and facilitate daily life for its participants. The academic theory of the courtroom workgroup has four cornerstone concepts that recognize this fact: Speed, Pragmatic Cynicism, Collegiality, and Secrecy. Efficient courtroom workgroups seek to process cases rather than dispense justice. This has been confirmed to greater and lesser extents in different courts.  [[Defendant]]s are assumed to be guilty. The procedural merits of the case are the true determinative factors of an outcome. Prosecutors and defense attorneys engage in a comparison of charges against possible procedural flaws and possible defenses to arrive at the going rate for a crime.  These factors are used to determine how much punishment the plea bargain will offer.  For example, group relationships and the desire to "maintain" a healthy working relationship are important to group members. The workings of the courtroom group and the "going rate" for given crimes are not matters for public disclosure. Estimates can be given to clients, but usually couched in terms of the prosecution's willingness to negotiate. (Summarized by O'Connor, T.R., 2005)

The courtroom workgroup is a mechanism for [[prosecutorial discretion]].  Various techniques are used to convince the defendant that the evidence against him or her is overwhelming.  “Charge stacking” is a process by which police and prosecutors create a case with numerous charges or numerous instances of the same charge to convince the defendant that the risk of not pleading guilty is intolerable.  The defendant may be convinced to plead guilty to a few of the charges in return for not being prosecuted for the remaining charges.

The courtroom workgroup is, in some sense, a response to a lack of resources for public defenders.  Defense attorneys in public defender offices often do not have sufficient time to prepare a case in detail for all of their clients.  Further, they often do not have the budget to fully investigate the facts of a case through either staff or private investigators.  They often must rely solely on police reports for such information.  In some jurisdictions, clients do not meet their attorneys until they are in court.  Typically, public defenders will meet briefly with clients in holding facilities or jails.  The defense attorney defends his or her client by seeking less punishment.  Huemann (1977) indicates that many defense attorneys feel pressured to keep up with their caseloads.  This pressure can manifest in the courtroom through rebukes by the judge for delays.  Many subtle pressures combine to encourage participation in the courtroom workgroup.

The concept of a courtroom workgroup is associated with plea bargaining. The courtroom workgroup shows remarkable explanatory power in overburdened courts dealing with large caseloads.  The courtroom workgroup model is best suited to explain jurisdictions where defense attorneys are more or less permanently assigned, but even occasionally appointed lawyers can participate in these practices. While many of the higher level prosecutions still follow the adversarial model, there is evidence that lower-level proceedings follow the courtroom workgroup model. Boland, Brady, Tyson, &amp; Bassler (1983) indicate that approximately 90 percent of criminal cases are settled by plea bargain. This figure appears to be stable over the last twenty years (Rainville &amp; Reaves, 2003). Some collaborative efforts on the part of the courtroom workgroup simply must be present to facilitate this high percentage of pleas.

The '''Crown of Ireland Act 1542'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Short title]] as conferred in [[Northern Ireland]] by the [[Short Titles Act (Northern Ireland) 1951]]; the Act lacks a short title in the [[Republic of Ireland]].&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of Ireland]] (33 Hen. 8 c. 1) which created the title of [[King of Ireland]] for King [[Henry VIII of England]] and his successors, who previously ruled the island as [[Lord of Ireland]].

The [[long title]] of the Act was "An Act that the King of England, his Heirs and Successors, be Kings of Ireland". Among the 18th-century [[Irish Patriot Party]] it was called the '''Act of Annexation'''.&lt;ref name="Grattan1822"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grattan|first=Henry|title=The Speeches of the Right Honourable Henry Grattan in the Irish, and in the Imperial Parliament |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=WdU9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA114|accessdate=22 February 2016|year=1822|publisher=Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme and Brown|page=114|chapter=Regency: Feb. 11, 1789|quote=The act of Henry VIII., commonly called the act of annexation, proves and ascertains what the member's arguments would deny, the existence, properties, and prerogatives of the Irish crown. |volume=II}}; {{cite book|title=A Review of Mr. Grattan's Answer to the Earl of Clare's Speech |url=http://opac.oireachtas.ie/Data/Library3/Library3/DCT081003.pdf#page=6|volume=Part the first|year=1800|publisher=J.

VIII. c. 1.) was in truth no more than an alteration in the Royal style.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
One of the earlier Christian overkingdoms, the [[Holy See]] of Rome, in 1171 abolished the [[High King of Ireland|High Kingship of Ireland]] ([[Máel Sechnaill mac Máele Ruanaid|of 9th-century origin]], successor to the [[Kingship of Tara]]) and devalued the ancient [[Kingdoms of Ireland]].

Under a [[Laudabiliter|Papal Bull]], the ancient realm was disestablished and turned into a feudal Province of the [[Secretariat of State (Vatican)|Secretariat of State]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] under the [[State (polity)|temporal power]] of the monarch of [[Kingdom of England|England]] who henceforth held the title [[Lord of Ireland]], relinquishing to the Papacy annual the tribute levied upon the nobility and people of Ireland.

The Act was passed in the [[Parliament of Ireland]], meeting in [[Dublin]], on 18 June 1541, being read out to parliament in English and [[Irish language|Irish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Moody, T. W.|title=A New History of Ireland. '''8''': A Chronology of Irish History|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1989|isbn=978-0-19-821744-2|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further developments in the 16th century==
The secession of various European rulers during the [[Protestant Reformation]], including Henry VIII, inspired the [[Papacy]] to initiate the [[Counter-Reformation]]. One consequence of this was that the Papacy required all Roman Catholic rulers to consider [[Protestant]] rulers (and their loyal subjects) as [[heresy|heretics]], thus making their realms illegitimate under customary Roman Catholic international law.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}  Consequently, the title "King of Ireland" was not initially recognised by Europe's Catholic monarchs and the Papacy. Instead, they remained committed in considering Ireland a feudal fief of the Papacy, to be granted to any Catholic sovereign who managed to secure the island Kingdom from the control of its Protestant monarchs.

After the death of Henry VIII's only legitimate son, [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], the throne passed to his oldest daughter, [[Mary I of England|Mary I]], who was a devout Roman Catholic. Mary shortly thereafter married [[Philip II of Spain|Philip of Spain]], who was also staunchly Catholic.  The new monarch restored papal authority in both England and Ireland. However, the status of Ireland as a kingdom remained in question: would the Papacy recognise Ireland's existence as a kingdom in its own right or maintain some fiction of temporal papal power in the land? To rectify this, [[Pope Paul IV]] issued a [[papal bull]] in 1555, ''{{lang|la|Ilius, per quem Reges regnant}}'', recognising Philip and Mary as King and Queen of England and its dominions including Ireland. Although this did not explicitly recognise Ireland as a kingdom, it represents the surrender of most of the Papacy's declared authority over Ireland, elevating it from a mere province of the Holy See to one that united Ireland's and England's crowns in one person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/national/ireland_docs.htm#act1542|title=Crown of Ireland Act 1542|work=Heraldica|date=25 July 2003|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary died without issue in 1558, and the thrones of England and Ireland passed to her half-sister, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], who was a Protestant. Once again, both kingdoms were removed from papal authority. In reply, [[Pope Pius V]] issued a papal bull in 1570, ''[[Regnans in Excelsis]]'', declaring "Elizabeth, the pretended Queen of England and the servant of crime" to be a heretic and releasing all her subjects from any allegiance to her and excommunicating any that obeyed her orders.

==Subsequent developments==

Over the course of the next two centuries, the Papacy and Europe's Catholic rulers continued to recognise Ireland as a Kingdom in its own right, whilst at the same time asserting its Protestant monarchy as illegitimate. Simultaneously, they would incite Catholic rebellion to Protestants in the island as a means of recovering Ireland to a Catholic sovereign, preceding the establishment of a Catholic sovereign on the English and Scottish thrones. In reply, British diplomacy concentrated on receiving the recognition of the sovereignty of Ireland from Catholic Europe in the hope of thereby ending future Catholic sovereign incitements of the larger Catholic peasantry and securing the western flank of Great Britain from Catholic invasion. 

Until 1801, Ireland continued to exist as a Kingdom in its own right, with its own Parliament. The government of Ireland, however, remained in English hands even after [[Constitution of 1782|Grattan's constitution]] came into effect in the 1780s. Most of the country's population remained Catholic, but its Protestant minority remained socially, politically, and economically dominant; and even many Protestants were excluded from power as not being members of the [[Established church|established]] [[Church of Ireland]]. The [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]] preserving the position of the [[Protestant Ascendancy]] began to be dismantled in the 1780s and 1790s. However, fear of revolutionary violence in the wake of the [[French Revolution]] and the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and subsequent republican [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]] led the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] government to seek the [[Acts of Union 1800|union of Ireland with Great Britain]]; this resulted in the formation of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].

==The 20th century==
As a result of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] that ended the [[Irish War of Independence]], Ireland left the United Kingdom in 1922 and became the [[Irish Free State]], a mostly self-governing [[Dominion]] that still retained the British monarch as its head of state. Shortly thereafter, the six north-eastern counties ([[Northern Ireland]]) seceded from the Free State and rejoined the United Kingdom, but with [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|their own parliament]] and system of government. Despite these fundamental changes, the 16th-century Act remained unamended on the statute books. 

From a British perspective, the Irish Free State became legislatively independent with the passage in the British parliament of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]]. However, the Irish Free State considered itself legislatively independent before its passage and did not recognize its legal situation as being changed. The country thereafter shared the person of its monarch with the United Kingdom and the other [[Dominion]]s of the then-called [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]].

The Irish Free State adopted a [[Constitution of Ireland|new constitution in 1937]], although the [[Monarchy of Ireland|Irish monarchy]] was not abolished in UK law until the [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948]]. The Tudor Act remained on the republic's statute books until formally repealed in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Statute Law Revision (Pre-Union Irish Statutes) Act 1962]], [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1962/en/act/pub/0029/sec0001.html section 1] and [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1962/en/act/pub/0029/sched1.html Schedule].&lt;/ref&gt;

==The act today==
{{As of|2017}}, Northern Ireland remains a constituent part of the United Kingdom; the Henrician Act remains law there. However, the offence in the act making it treason to endanger the sovereign or her possession of [[the Crown]] now carries only a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, following the completion of the abolition of [[capital punishment in the United Kingdom]] in 1998.

An '''eternity clause''' in the [[constitution]] or [[basic law]] of a country is a clause intended to ensure that the law or constitution cannot be changed by amendment. Eternity clauses are a type of [[entrenched clause]] in the constitutions of the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic|Czech Republic]],&lt;ref name=CECEE/&gt; [[Constitution of Germany|Germany]], [[Constitution of Turkey|Turkey]], [[Constitution of Greece|Greece]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hellenicparliament.gr/UserFiles/f3c70a23-7696-49db-9148-f24dce6a27c8/001-156%20aggliko.pdf The official English language translation of the Greek Constitution as of May 27, 2008], Article 110 §1, p. 124, source: Hellenic Parliament, "The provisions of the Constitution shall be subject to revision with the exception of those which determine the form of government as a Parliamentary Republic and those of articles 2 paragraph 1, 4 paragraphs 1, 4 and 7 , 5 paragraphs 1 and 3, 13 paragraph 1, and 26."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constitution of Italy|Italy]],&lt;ref name=weakcon&gt;{{cite book|title=Weak Constitutionalism: Democratic Legitimacy and the Question of Constituent Power (Routledge Research in Constitutional Law|author=Joel Colón-Ríos|isbn=978-0415671903|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TqqQAzH2zxEC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ac5BHQMPUf&amp;sig=W94bSY1hO-OioXESL7MR08Hp_gI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8LVJUP-bAYnb0QXhuoDQCA|year=2012|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constitution of Morocco|Morocco]],&lt;ref name=EWC/&gt; [[Constitution of Iran|the Islamic Republic of Iran]], [[Constitution of Brazil|the Federative Republic of Brazil]] and [[Constitution of Norway|Norway]].&lt;ref name=weakcon/&gt;

The [[Constitution of India]] and the [[Constitution of Colombia]] contain similar provisions aimed at making it difficult, but not impossible, to change their basic structure.&lt;ref name=weakcon/&gt;

==Brazil==
Article 60 paragraph 4th of the [[Constitution of Brazil|Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil]], lists four subject areas of the Constitution that cannot be amended:&lt;ref&gt;[[:pt:Constituição brasileira de 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Federal form of the state; 
# direct, secret universal and periodic voting; 
# separation of powers; and 
# individual rights and guarantees.

There are other clauses that implicitly cannot be amended, mostly because they are dependent of the subjects above.

==Czech Republic==
The [[Czech Constitution]] contains an explicit eternity clause, whereby the [[Czech constitutional court]] assumes the role of ultimate arbiter of the effect of [[European law]] on the constitution.&lt;ref name=CECEE&gt;{{cite book|title=Constitutional Evolution in Central and Eastern Europe (Studies in Modern Law and Policy) |author=Kyriaki Topidi and Alexander H.E. Morawa|isbn=978-1409403272|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IhLKZKm7zGgC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6I3qdcCgv7&amp;sig=-N5b6wCU8dqfjiKGSAe1xWgxBmA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8LVJUP-bAYnb0QXhuoDQCA|year=2010|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
The German eternity clause (German: ''Ewigkeitsklausel'') is Article 79 paragraph (3) of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] (German: ''Grundgesetz''). The eternity clause establishes that certain fundamental principles of [[Germany]]'s democracy can never be removed, even by [[parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/304634/defending-german-democracy-andrew-stuttaford|title=Defending German Democracy|publisher=[[National Review]]|date=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental principles, (i.e., "the basic principles" of Articles 1 and 20), are as follows:

* '''Duty of all state authority''': "The dignity of man is inviolable. To respect and protect it is the duty of all state authority." Art. 1;
* '''Acknowledgement of human rights''': "The German people therefore acknowledge inviolable and inalienable human rights as the basis of every community, of peace and of justice in the world." Art. 1 Para. (2);
* '''Directly enforceable law''': "The following basic rights bind the legislature, the executive and judiciary as directly enforceable law." Art. 1 Para. (3);
* '''Republic''' (form of government): Art. 20 Para. (1);
* '''Federal state''' ''(Länder)'': Art. 20 Para. (1);
* '''Social state''' (welfare state): Art. 20 Para. (1);
* '''Sovereignty of the People''': "All state authority emanates from the People." Art. 20 Para. (2);
* '''Democratic''': "All state authority is exercised by the people by means of elections and voting and by specific legislative, executive and judicial organs." Art. 20 Para. (2);
* '''Rule of law''' (Rechtsstaat): "Legislation is subject to the constitutional order. The executive and judiciary are bound by the law." Art. 20 Para. (3);
* '''Separation of powers''': "Specific legislative, executive and judicial organs," each "bound by the law." Art. 20 Paras. (2) and (3).

The ''[[Parlamentarischer Rat]]'' (Parliamentary Council) included the eternity clause in its Basic Law specifically to prevent a new "legal" pathway to a dictatorship as was the case in the [[Weimar Republic]] with the [[Enabling Act of 1933]].&lt;ref name="iiea"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiea.com/publications/challenges-to-the-esm-treaty-and-the-fiscal-compact-treaty-before-the-german-constitutional-court|title=The Euro Crisis: Challenges to the ESM Treaty and the Fiscal Compact Treaty before the German Constitutional Court|publisher=[[Institute of International and European Affairs]]|date=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not possible for any political party, any legislation or any national commitment to violate "the basic principles" of "this Basic Law" laid down in Articles 1 and 20. Furthermore, the only way that Articles 1 and 20 can be removed is through Article 146, which requires "a constitution that is adopted by a free decision of the German People."&lt;ref name="iiea" /&gt;  So long as the principles of Articles 1 and 20 are retained, they may be amended (as Article 20 has indeed been amended to establish a 'right of resistance'), but the full protection of the eternity clause does not extend to such amendments.

Unlike the [[Weimar Constitution]], which made human rights only an objective, the eternity clause and Articles 1 and 20 make specific demands of "all state authority" regarding "human rights" (that is, "the basic rights" guaranteed in "this Basic Law") and have established specific [[Legislature|legislative]], [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[judicial]] organs in "the constitutional order" of "this Basic Law", each with separate functions bound by the [[law]]. These are "the basic principles" of the [[rule of law|democratic rule of law]] (German: ''[[Rechtsstaat]]'') and the [[separation of powers]], which are principles endorsed by three [[United Nations resolution]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/ruleoflaw/index.shtml|title=United Nations and the Rule of Law |publisher=Un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Vague|date=September 2018}}

==Greece==
The Greek eternity clause is Article 110 of the [[Constitution of Greece|Greek Constitution]]. This article states that every article of the [[Constitution of Greece|Constitution]] can be revised by the [[Hellenic Parliament|Parliament]], except of the fundemental ones, which establish [[Greece]] as a [[parliamentary republic]] and those of articles 2 paragraph 1, article 4 paragraphs 1, 4 and 7, article 5 paragraphs 1 and 3, article 13 paragraph 1 and article 26&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hellenicparliament.gr/UserFiles/f3c70a23-7696-49db-9148-f24dce6a27c8/001-156%20aggliko.pdf|title=Constitution of Greece in English|publisher= [[Hellenic Parliament]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These fundamental articles include:

* '''Republic''' (form of government): Art. 1 Para. (1);
* '''Sovereignty of the People''': "All state authority emanates from the People." Art. 1 Para. (2);
* '''Democratic''': "All state authority is exercised by the people, exist for the perople and the nation and are exercised as the Constitution suggests." Art. 1 Para. (3);
* '''Duty of all state authority''': "The dignity of man is inviolable. To respect and protect it is the duty of all state authority." Art. 2 Para. (1);
* '''Rule of law''': "Every Greek is equal to the law." Art. 4 Para. (1);
* '''About Public Function''': "Only Greek citizens are acceptable to all public functions, except of the exceptions in special laws." Art. 4 Para (4);
* '''About nobility titles''': "Noble or excellence titles are not given and not reconised on Greek citizens." Art. 4 Para (7);
* '''Acknowledgement of free personality''': "All people shall have the right to develop freely their personality and to participate in the social, economic and political life of the country, insofar as they do not infringe the rights of others or violate the Constitution and the good usages." Art. 5 Para (1);
* '''Personal Liberty''': "Personal liberty is inviolable. No one shall be prosecuted, arrested, imprisoned or otherwise confined except when and as the law provides." Art. 5 Para. (3);
* '''Freedom of Religion''': "Freedom of religious conscience is inviolable. The enjoyment of civil rights and liberties does not depend on the individual’s religious beliefs." Art. 13 Para. (1)
* '''Separation of powers''': "Specific legislative, executive and judicial organs," Art. 26;

==India==
The [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] has developed the [[basic structure doctrine]] which holds that certain features of the [[Constitution of India|constitution]] are fundamental in nature and cannot be modified through parliamentary amendment. The Supreme Court has yet to clearly delimit the components of the basic structure.

==Iran==
The final Article of the [[Constitution of Iran|Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran]], Art. 177, ensures that particular aspects of the Constitution are unalterable. These include the Islamic character of government and laws, the objectives of the republic, the democratic character of the government, “the absolute wilayat al-'amr and the leadership of the Ummah,” the administration of the country by referendum, and the official religion of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iranchamber.com/government/laws/constitution_ch13.php The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morocco==
In the [[Constitution of Morocco]], eternity clauses exist that ensure certain provisions cannot be amended, including the role of [[Islam]] in the nation's law, and the role of the [[List of rulers of Morocco|King of Morocco]] in law.&lt;ref name=EWC&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of World Constitutions|author=Gerhard Robbers|isbn=978-0816060788|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M3A-xgf1yM4C&amp;pg=PA626&amp;lpg=PA626&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YdnxLlYGpo&amp;sig=6JeZzSC2H1Ms2nzztB6w7F1N7H8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CLNJULKMOYXL0AWJ6YHICw|year=2006|page=626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European civil code''' (ECC) is a proposed harmonisation of private law across the [[European Union]]. 

The ultimate aim of a European [[civil code]] is, like a national [[civil code]], to deal comprehensively with the core areas of private law. Private law typically covered in a civil code includes the [[family law]], the law of [[inheritance]], [[property law]] and the [[Law of Obligations]]. The law of obligations includes the law of contracts, [[delicts]] (or [[tort]]s) and [[restitution]]. It was from work on European contract law that the push for a comprehensive European civil code arose. The development of a European civil code has primarily focused on creating a unified law of contracts. Thus, the term 'European civil code' is often used in specific reference to the harmonisation of contract law throughout the EU.

== History ==
=== The Lando Commission ===
The idea of a unified European civil code can be traced to the idea of a unified Europe and the creation of the European Union. The European Parliament requested the creation of a European civil code in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;''Official Journal of the European Communities'', 1989, N. C 158/400.&lt;/ref&gt; 1994 and 2000.  A pragmatic approach has seen the proponents of a European civil code develop uniform laws in discrete areas before working towards a comprehensive European civil code.

Development of a European code for contract law began in 1982 with the formation of the Commission on European Contract Law. This became known as the Lando Commission after its chairman [[Ole Lando]]. At the same time [[UNIDROIT]] began similar studies leading to their 1994 publication Principles for International Commercial Contracts. The Lando Commission focused on creating their ''[[Principles of European Contract Law]]'' (PECL). The first part of the PECL was published in 1995, followed by Part II in 1999 and the final Part III in 2003. These Principles of European Contract Law may eventually form one part of the European civil code.

=== ''Towards a European Civil Code'' ===
In 1997 the Dutch Government, as then Chair of the European Union, held a conference titled 'Towards a European Civil Code'. The conference considered the feasibility of such a code and led to the creation of a book titled ''Towards a European Civil Code''. The third edition was published in 2004 and although the primary focus is European contract law, it considers other areas of private law that may form part of a European civil code as well. The years following this conference have seen the development of many academic groups focusing on different areas of private law. These include: 

* The Study Group on a European Civil Code,&lt;ref name="Hondius14"&gt;Hondius et al. (2004), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; formed in 1997 and chaired by Professor [[Christian von Bar]] at the [[University of Osnabrück]].
* The Acquis Group (official name: Research Group on EC Private Law) at the [[University of Münster]] focuses on existing European Community private law.&lt;ref name="Hondius15"&gt;Idem, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Commission on European Family Law]] based at [[Utrecht University]].
* The [[European Group on Tort Law]], also called the Spier/Koziol group, in association with the [[European Centre of Tort and Insurance Law]] in Vienna.&lt;ref name="Hondius14"/&gt;
* The Common Core of European Private Law project conducted by [[Mauro Bussani]] and [[Ugo Mattei]] at the [[University of Trento]].&lt;ref name="Hondius14"/&gt;
* The Académie des Privatistes Européens at the [[University of Pavia]], headed by Giuseppe Gandolfi. It published a Draft Code ('avant-projet') in 2002.&lt;ref name="Hondius14"/&gt;
* The Leuven Centre for a Common Law of Europe, founded in 2001 by professor [[Walter Van Gerven]], who wrote a number of European casebooks together with [[Basil Markesinis]].&lt;ref name="Hondius15"/&gt;
* The Joint Network on European Private Law  has also been created and includes several of the above groups.

=== ''Common Frame of Reference'' ===
On 11 July 2001, the European Commission issued a Communication in relation to possible developments in European contract law. Following the review of submissions on the Communication, the Commission released an Action Plan for a more coherent European contract law in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;von Bar et al. (2009), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The Action Plan began the process of creating what is known as the ''[[Common Frame of Reference]]'' (CFR). This was followed in 2004 by the publication of “European Contract Law and revision of the acquis: the way forward”. The CFR is intended to provide a structure and guideline for the development of harmonised European private law but has a specific focus on contract law. It was hoped that the creation of a unified European contract law would be achieved by 2010.

The ''Draft Common Frame of Reference'' (DCFR), a joint project of the Study Group and Acquis Group (funded by the European Commission for €4.3 million), was published in December 2007. Although the European Commission downplayed the CFR's expected future importance in a July 2006 report, a March 2006 European Parliament resolution stated that "Even though the Commission denies that this is its objective, it is clear that many of the researchers and stakeholders working on the project believe that the ultimate long-term outcome will be a European code of obligations or even a full-blown European Civil Code."&lt;ref name="Beunderman"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://euobserver.com/institutional/24979 |title=Academic handbook could form basis for EU civil code |author=Mark Beunderman |work=[[EUobserver]] |date=22 October 2017 |accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economist Gerhard Wagner hailed "the drafting of a coherent set of rules" for all of Europe, such as the DCFR, as "an immense scientific achievement".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wagner |first=Gerhard |date=2009 |title=The Common Frame of Reference: A View from Law &amp; Economics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oii7E0IVsAs |location=Munich |publisher=Sellier. European Law Publishers |page=204 |isbn=9783866531109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents of a European civil code ==
A comprehensive European civil code would cover the major areas of private law in much the same way as domestic civil codes. The major areas that have been suggested are contract law, torts, property, restitution and also company law.  

Although family law and inheritance law are normally covered by domestic civil codes there is doubt over whether it is possible to include them in a broad European code. Family and Inheritance law is often closely tied to a nation’s culture. For this reason it may not be possible or suitable to create a uniform code to cover the entire European Union. 
As previously stated, contract law is perhaps the most suited for harmonisation, followed by other areas of the law of obligations and the law of property.
The creation of individual codes for discrete areas of private law is considered the most feasible and realistic goal. For this reason efforts have concentrated on creating a unified European contract law before attempting a more comprehensive European civil code. 

An example of a modern comprehensive code is the Dutch ''[[Burgerlijk Wetboek]]'' which came into force in 1992. The ''Burgerlijk Wetboek'' covers civil, commercial law, consumer law and labour law and was almost 40 years in the making. This gives an indication of how long it may take to create a complete unified European civil code. The March 2006 European Parliament resolution recommended taking the new Dutch civil code as a model as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P6-TA-2006-0109+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN |title=European Parliament resolution on European contract law and the revision of the acquis: the way forward |author=European Parliament |work=europarl.europa.eu |date=23 March 2006 |accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arguments for and against a European civil code ==
Many arguments have been raised both supporting and rejecting the idea of a European civil code. Included in this are claims that the creation of a civil code binding across the European Union will be impossible to achieve. As a much broader project, the creation of a European civil code is more easily dismissed than attempts at unifying discrete areas such as contract law.

=== For ===
Arguments supporting a unified European civil code relate to the emergence of the European Union and an increasingly globalised economy. Proponents also point out that Europe, including England, shares a long legal history in the form of the ''[[ius commune]]'' before the 18th and 19th century national codifications.&lt;ref name="Lesaffer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hesselink"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2007/10/10/een-europees-burgerlijk-wetboek-is-juist-goed-idee-11408152-a522709 |title=Een Europees Burgerlijk Wetboek is juist goed idee |author=Martijn W. Hesselink |work=[[NRC Handelsblad]] |date=10 October 2007 |accessdate=1 September 2017 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, except for England and Ireland, all of Europe shares the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law tradition]] which began with the [[Napoleonic Code]] of 1804.&lt;ref name="Lesaffer"/&gt;

# The European Union represents a unification of Europe and a reduction in the significance of national borders. The creation of a European civil code can be seen as a further step in this process of unification.&lt;ref name="Lesaffer"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lesaffer |first=Randall C.H. |date=2008 |title=Inleiding tot de Europese Rechtsgeschiedenis |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=aniyulpSVVoC&amp;pg=PA5 |location=Leuven |publisher=Leuven University Press |page=4–5 |isbn=9789058676795 |accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# There is no particular reason to assume the national level is the 'natural' level to regulate matters such as contract law on, because it was nearly the same across Europe for centuries up until the 19th century (when nation-states were formed), and if it would be somehow better regulated 'closer to the citizens', one might as well take it to the provincial or municipal level instead of the national level.&lt;ref name="Hesselink"/&gt;
# Differences in national laws may create problems of efficacy in the ever more globalised economy. A uniform civil code will help overcome these problems and reduce barriers to increased trade within the European Union.&lt;ref name="Lesaffer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hesselink"/&gt;
# European integration has rapidly increased the mobility of private persons, be they employees, students, migrants or tourists. Harmonisation of European civil law will facilitate citizens' mobility by increasing their legal security.&lt;ref name="Lesaffer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hesselink"/&gt;
# The increasing use of standard form contracts is also said to indicate a desire for a European civil code or at least a harmonisation of European contract law.&lt;ref name="Hesselink"/&gt;
# Anticipated obstacles, such as the alleged incompatibility between the continental civil law tradition and the English common law tradition, shouldn't be too much of a problem to overcome, since the underlying legal concepts and rules aren't really all that different.&lt;ref name="Lesaffer"/&gt;
# Some argue for an 'optional' European Civil Code, alongside the national civil codes, leaving the contracting parties the freedom to choose and thus opening up more possibilities.&lt;ref name="Hesselink"/&gt;
# Contracting parties will no longer need to hire expensive experts from the countries involved to explain to judges how the respective countries' law is to be understood on numerous matters. A policy aimed at the development of a European civil code will easily pass the [[Proportionality_(law)#European_Union_law|proportionality test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} {{Cite book |last=Nieuwenhuis |first=Hans  |date=2015 |title=Een steeds hechter verbond: Europa op weg naar Europa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rj2yCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT156 |location= |publisher=Uitgeverij Balans |page=156 |isbn=9789460030819 |accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Against ===
The feasibility of a European civil code has been questioned on both political and legal grounds. Cultural differences and the lack of a common European legal culture are often cited by opponents. The connection between law, language, culture and national history forms one small aspect of the arguments against replacing national [[civil code]]s with a European code. Arguments based upon cultural differences are, however, difficult to establish.

More substantive difficulties, which for some are reasons why it is neither feasible nor desirable to create a European civil code, include: 

# The process by which Community instruments are now produced leads almost inevitably to second-rate law. For example, within private international law, which is harmonised within the European Union, the Rome II Regulation is an unhappy political compromise between Parliament, Council and Commission.
# Once a Civil Code is in place any errors it contains will take years, if not decades, to correct as agreement from all participating parties will be required.
# Any Civil Code will be a piecemeal replacement of part of each member state's legal system. Laws within nations form a system: one part is shaped by and dependent upon another. Replacing part of each system's law, without altering the rest, will introduce incoherence.
# If the European Court of Justice is given jurisdiction over the interpretation of any code, even more disputes will be subject to the gross delays to which appeals to that court are already subject.
# The draft principles in existence are not, substantively, satisfactory. For example, the draft Principles of Liability for Non-Contractual Damage define "causation" in a way that is transparently circular: "A person causes legally relevant damage to another if the damage is to be regarded as a consequence of that person’s conduct or the source of danger for which that person is responsible." 
# It is impossible within a few brief code provisions to capture the many technical and minor points which are thrown up in private law disputes. Within member states these have long been settled, although not uniformly. A new Code will lead to immense litigation and disruption as these points are re-litigated anew.
# There is also the issue regarding the differences between common law and civil law and which principles to adopt, an issue which can be underrated. Opponents argue the two systems vary greatly at times and any successful civil code would have to take this into consideration due to the UK's status as compared to the rest of the EU. This makes introducing "harmonised" or "standardised" principles difficult in both theory and practice where some jurisdictions do not recognise certain practices (i.e. the right to specific performance, the inclusion of prior negotiations in contract interpretation etc.) or approach concepts in different ways (i.e. "good faith", "equity"). It would not be easy to reconcile such differences.&lt;ref name="Lesaffer"/&gt;

In April 2017, after [[Theresa May]] triggered [[Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|Article 50]] [[United Kingdom invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|for the UK]], [[Guy Verhofstadt]] remarked that "it was naïve, maybe, to reconcile the legal system of Napoleon with the common law of the British Empire, and perhaps it was never meant to be. But our predecessors should never be blamed for having tried to."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhpnVKxCfUw |title=Guy Verhofstadt 05 Apr 2017 plenary speech on BREXIT Negotiations with the UK |author=Guy Verhofstadt |work=ALDE Group |date=5 April 2017 |accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether the European Union has the legal power to create a European civil code has also been an issue. Article 95 of the [[EC Treaty]] is considered the means through which a code would be created. However, many people{{who?|date=August 2017}} believe that the EU lacks the constitutional competence to enact a comprehensive code. Others argue that this does not defeat the idea of a European civil code and is merely a political issue. If a general consensus were to be reached in favour of a European civil code, it might be politically possible to expand the constitutional competence of the European Union or create an international treaty giving effect to the code. According to professor Christian von Bar "it fully depends on a political decision of the European Commission, the [EU] Council and the European Parliament if in the end, the ''Common Frame of Reference'' will be adopted as an EU instrument."&lt;ref name="Beunderman"/&gt;

== European contract law ==
As previously stated, the discussion of a European civil code has had a primary focus on the development of a unified European contract code. Proponents of a European code of contract law have largely been divided into two groups. One group favours the use of the [[acquis communautaire]] (the body of European Union law) as the basis of a unified European contract law. The other has preferred a foundation in the field of comparative law and analysis of the domestic contract law of member states of the EU. The latter view was the initially dominant opinion in the field, but more recently the Acquis position has come to the fore.

Both options were provided for in the Commission of European Communities 2001 Communication on European contract law. Although there were many submissions supporting both fields of thought, most favoured a review of the Acquis as a basis for developing European contract law. The subsequent Action Plan and its follow up Way Forward paper have progressed the development of a European code of contract law as well as a more comprehensive European civil code. The intended outcome of this new stage is the publication of the Common Frame of Reference. The CFR is hoped by some to form the central part of a future unified European contract law, although this is not its purpose. It is expected to be published in 2009/10.{{update after|2010|12|31}}

Professor European Private Law Martijn W. Hesselink (director of the Amsterdam Centre for the Study of European Contract Law at the [[University of Amsterdam]]) argued in October 2007 that the development of a European contract code, or more broadly, civil code, should happen transparently, and with the participation and consent of citizens, consumers and smaller companies, lest big businesses will be able to obtain too much power over the others.&lt;ref name="Hesselink"/&gt;

A '''fair trade law''' was a [[statute]] in any of various states of the United States that permitted manufacturers the right to specify the minimum retail price of a commodity, a practice known as "[[Resale price maintenance|price maintenance]]".  Such laws first appeared in 1931 during the [[Great Depression]] in the state of [[California]].  They were ostensibly intended to protect small businesses to some degree from competition from very large chain stores during a time when small businesses were suffering.  Many people objected to this on the grounds that if the manufacturers could set the price, consumers would have to pay more even at large discount stores.  The complexity of the market also made the enforcement of these laws almost impractical.  As the chain stores became more popular, and bargain prices more common, there was a widespread repeal of the laws in many jurisdictions.  By 1975, the laws had been repealed completely&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/fair-trade-law&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.factmonster.com/ce6/bus/A0818158.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8257">'''Forensic rhetoric''', as coined in [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[On Rhetoric]]'', encompasses any discussion of past action including legal discourse—the primary setting for the emergence of [[rhetoric]] as a discipline and theory. This contrasts with [[deliberative rhetoric]] and [[epideictic|epideictic rhetoric]], which are reserved for discussions concerning future and present actions respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, On Rhetoric, 1.3.10-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary times, the word ''forensic'' is commonly associated with [[Criminal law|criminal]] and [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] referring specifically to [[forensic science]]. It is important to note that the term ''forensic'' associated with criminal investigation exists because forensic (or judicial) rhetoric first existed.&lt;ref&gt;George Kennedy, Aristotle On Rhetoric: A Theory of Civic Discourse, (New York: Oxford University Press, 1991), 87-118.&lt;/ref&gt;

==References in ''On Rhetoric''==

An introduction of the three types of rhetoric (forensic, deliberative, and epideictic) occurs in Book I Chapter III of Aristotle's ''On Rhetoric''.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy 1991, 87.&lt;/ref&gt;  Discussion of forensic rhetoric is found in Book I Chapters X-XV, outlined as follows:

* Chapter 10: "Topics about [[Wrongdoing]]" asserts: "Let wrongdoing be defined as doing harm willingly in contravention of the law."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, 1.3.10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle also defines three considerations of forensic rhetoric: 1. For what purposes persons do wrong 2. How these persons are mentally disposed 3. What kind of persons they wrong and what these persons are like.
* Chapter 11: "Topics about Pleasure" categorizes pleasure as natural, not compulsive, and can be the cause of crime: gaining revenge, winning, or restoring honor.
* Chapter 12: "Topics about Wrongdoers and Those Wronged" includes many features of both the wrongdoers and the wronged that relate to criminalities:
**Wrongdoers: believe they will not be detected or punished, are likely to go unsuspected if their appearance is inconsistent with the charges (a weak man charged with assault), have either no enemy or many enemies.
**Those who are wronged: have something the wrongdoer lacks, do not live cautiously, have never been wronged, or have been often wronged with no retaliation.
* Chapter 13: "Topics about [[Justice]] and [[Injustice]]" discusses the [[law]] in two ways: specific (that which has been defined for each person) and common (that which is based on nature or common principle).
* Chapter 14: "The Koinon of Degree of Magnitude" proposes: "A wrong is greater insofar as it is caused by greater injustice. Thus the least wrong can sometimes be the greatest."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''On Rhetoric'', 1.3.14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle asserts that varying degrees of wrong exist based on the accessibility of retribution from the wronged and [[punishment]] for the wrongdoer.
* Chapter 15: "Atechnic Pisteis in Judicial Rhetoric: Laws, Witnesses, Contracts, Tortures, Oaths" summarizes the objects listed in its title, including evidence that supports or refutes a case. These summaries and guidelines are very practical in law both in Aristotle's and in modern times. Aristotle also focuses on fairness and introduces the possibility that the [[defendant]] could be legally guilty yet morally justified.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy 1991, 87-118.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early connection between law and rhetoric==

According to [[George A. Kennedy (classicist)|George A. Kennedy]], rhetoric emerged as a response to legal freedoms introduced in Greece around 467BC. "Citizens found themselves involved in [[litigation]]... and were forced to take up their own cases before the courts. A few clever [[Sicilians]] developed simple techniques for effective presentation and [[argumentation]] in the law courts and taught them to others."&lt;ref name="Jasinski"&gt;James Jasinski, "Forensic Discourse," ''Sourcebook on Rhetoric'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, trained capacity in speech-making and the theory about such speech-making exists because of legal exigencies.

The Stasis Doctrine, proposed by [[Hermagoras of Temnos|Hermagoras]], is an approach to systematically analyze legal cases, which many scholars include in their treatises of rhetoric, most famously in [[Cicero]]’s "[[De Inventione]]."&lt;ref&gt;Jakes Jasinski, "Stasis," ''Sourcebook on Rhetoric'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  Encyclopedia author [[James Jasinski]] describes this doctrine as taxonomy to classify relevant questions in a debate and the existence or nonexistence of a fact in law.&lt;ref name="Jasinski-p530"&gt;Jasinski 2001, 530.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Stasis Doctrine is incorporated in rhetoric handbooks today.&lt;ref name="Jasinski-p530" /&gt;

==Traditional connection between law and rhetoric==
Since forensic rhetoric’s original purpose was to win courtroom cases, legal aids have been trained in it since legal [[freedoms]] emerged. Because in early law [[courts]], citizens were expected to represent themselves and training in forensic rhetoric was very beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;George A. Kennedy, Classical Rhetoric &amp; its Christian and Secular Tradition from Ancient to Modern Times, (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 1999), 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient Athens, litigants in a private law suit and defendants in a criminal prosecution were expected to handle their own case before the court - a practice that Aristotle approved of. The hearings would consist of questions addressed to the litigant/defendant and were asked by a member of the Court, or the litigants could ask one another; these circumstances did not call for legal or oratorical talent - therefore oratory or legalism was not expected, encouraged, or appreciated. After the time of Solon, the Court of Areopagus was replaced and the litigant/defendant would deliver a prepared speech before the courts to try and sway the jury; they expected dramatic and brilliant oratorical displays. Now, listeners appreciated oratorical and even legalistic niceties, such as appeals to passion, piety, and prejudice. It was at this point in Athens history where the forensic speech-writer made his first appearance. The speech-writer would prepare an address which the litigant/defendant memorized and delivered before the court. Forensic speech-writing and oratory soon became an essential part of general rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anton-Hermann Chroust]], Legal Profession in Ancient Athens, 29 Notre Dame L. Rev. 339 (1954).&lt;/ref&gt;  After the nineteenth century, forensic rhetoric “became the exclusive province of lawyers,” as it essentially remains today.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy 1999, 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  These people were experts in the court system and dominated forensic rhetoric, since it is tied to past events—thus the relationship between law and rhetoric was solidified.&lt;ref&gt;Laurent Pernot, Rhetoric in Antiquity, (Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University of America Press, 2005), 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary connection between law and rhetoric==

The [[critical legal studies]] movement occurred because as [[John Lucaites|John L. Lucaites]], a prominent author on the subject, concluded both [[legal studies]] and rhetorical scholars desire to demystify complex law discourse.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Lucaites, "Between Rhetoric and "The Law": Power, Legitimacy, and Social Change,"Quarterly Journal, 76 (1990): 379-96.&lt;/ref&gt;  His task was to "explore how 'the law'—conceptualized as a series of institutional procedures and relationships—functions within a larger 'rhetorical culture'."&lt;ref name="Jasinski" /&gt;

Author [[James Boyd White]] cultivated the [[law and literature]] movement, promoting the relationship between law and rhetoric at the constitutive level of discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Jasinski 2001, 262.&lt;/ref&gt;  The name ''law and literature'' relates to both the study of law in literature (such as legal fiction) and law as literature (the community built from a discourse community).&lt;ref&gt;Steven Mailloux, ''Rhetorical Power'', (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; This movement asserts that the process of interpretation, both in law and literature, is rhetorical: "interpretation is a process of constructing arguments and the meaning of a text emerges through rhetorical interaction."&lt;ref name="Jasinski" /&gt;

Historically, forfeiture of a convict’s land and other assets followed on from conviction for certain serious offences (and thus resulted from criminal activity rather than from a failure to act).  A striking illustration of the practical effects of this rule is [[Giles Corey]]’s refusal to plead, in the [[Salem Witch Trials]], instead dying under ''[[peine forte et dure]]''.  By refusing to plead he avoided the jurisdiction of the court and thus avoided conviction and the consequent forfeiture of his estate.  Instead it passed to his sons.{{citation needed |date=November 2018}}

In the early 21st century, the [[United States Government]] began to seize [[domain name]]s, on the legal theory that they were property used in [[criminal activity|criminal activities]] and thus subject to forfeiture.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1708">'''Geojurisprudence''' is "a [[system]]ic approach to the connections of [[legal science]] to [[geography]] and [[geopolitics]]" ([[Manfred Langhans-Ratzeburg]] - ''Begriff und Aufgaben der Geographischen Rechtswissenshaft (Geojurisprudenz)'' published by Kurt Vowinkel in 1928 as a companion volume to [[Karl Haushofer]]'s ''Zeitschrift für Geopolitik'' (ZfG).

Haushofer opened the topic in his essay "Geopolitik und Geojurisprudenz" which appeared in ''Zeitschrift für Völkerrecht'' in 1928. Here he lamented the lack of geographical understanding in [[Germany|German]] legal studies. 

He said this contributed towards the general failure of the German populace to understand the nature of the [[First World War]]. He heralded Langhans-Ratzeburg as the chief representative of this new discipline, which he suggested would overcome the "thin, sterile air of legal scientific concepts and the fraudulent, political scientific, treaty-waving political posture of the so-called central powers". 

With a return to putatively "German" concepts of legal relations between states, invigorated by incorporating a geographical perspective, then borders as durable legal structures rooted in geography would emerge.

With this introduction, ''Langhans-Ratzeburg'' in turn praised not only Haushofer, but also [[Alfred Hettner]], [[Walther Vogel]] and [[Albert von Hoffmann]] for their attempts to link geography, history, politics and culture.

{{Other uses|Golden Rule (disambiguation)}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}
The '''Golden Rule''' is the principle of treating others as one's self would wish to be treated. It is a [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] that is found in many religions and [[culture]]s.&lt;ref name="Flew"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=golden rule|editor =[[Antony Flew]] | encyclopedia=A Dictionary of Philosophy |publisher = [[Pan Books]] in association with [[Macmillan Publishers|The MacMillan Press]] | year = 1979 | location = London | page = 134 | isbn=0-330-48730-2}} This dictionary of philosophy contains the following quote under the entry for "golden rule": "The maxim 'Treat others how you wish to be treated'.

Various expressions of the rule exist in the tenets of most religions and creeds through the ages, testifying to its universal applicability." (end quote).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Terence Stace]] argued that the Golden Rule was much more than simply an [[ethics|ethical code]]. Instead, he posits, it "express[es] the essence of a universal [[morality]]." The rationale for this crucial distinction occupies much of his book ''The Concept of Morals'' (1937). See:
 {{cite book

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Golden Rule can be considered an '''ethic of reciprocity''' in some [[religion]]s, although other religions treat it differently. The maxim may appear as either a positive or negative [[injunction]] governing conduct:

* One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself (positive or directive form).
* One should ''not'' treat others in ways that one would ''not'' like to be treated (negative or prohibitive form).&lt;ref name="Flew" /&gt;
* What you wish upon others, you wish upon yourself (empathic or responsive form).&lt;ref name="Flew" /&gt;

The idea dates at least to the early [[Confucian]] times (551–479 BCE) according to [[Rushworth Kidder]], who identifies that this concept appears prominently in [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Judaism]], [[Taoism]],  [[Zoroastrianism]], and "the rest of the world's major religions".&lt;ref name="W.A. Spooner 1914 pp. 310"&gt;W.A. Spooner, "The Golden Rule," in James Hastings, ed.

Kidder, ''How Good People Make Tough Choices: Resolving the Dilemmas of Ethical Living'', Harper, New York, 2003. {{ISBN|0-688-17590-2}}. p. 159.

Yet, as with any historically prominent maxim, the Golden Rule is not without its controversy (as seen in [[Golden_Rule#Criticism|the Criticism section]] below).

== Ancient history ==

=== Ancient Egypt ===
Possibly the earliest affirmation of the maxim of reciprocity, reflecting the ancient Egyptian goddess [[Ma'at]], appears in the story of [[The Eloquent Peasant]], which dates to the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (c. 2040–1650 BC): "Now this is the command: Do to the doer to make him do."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/wsrp/information/REL499_2011/Eloquent%20Peasant.pdf Eloquent Peasant PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925125920/http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/wsrp/information/REL499_2011/Eloquent%20Peasant.pdf |date=25 September 2015 }} "Now this is the command: do to the doer to make him do"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="John Albert Wilson p. 121"&gt;''"The Culture of Ancient Egypt"'', John Albert Wilson, p. 121, [[University of Chicago Press]], 1956, {{ISBN|0-226-90152-1}} "Now this is the command: Do to the doer to cause that he do"&lt;/ref&gt; This proverb embodies the ''[[do ut des]]'' principle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/wsrp/information/REL499_2011/Eloquent%20Peasant.pdf Eloquent Peasant PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925125920/http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/wsrp/information/REL499_2011/Eloquent%20Peasant.pdf |date=25 September 2015 }} "The peasant quotes a proverb that embodies the do ut des principle"&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]] (c. 664–323 BC) papyrus contains an early negative affirmation of the Golden Rule: "That which you hate to be done to you, do not do to another."&lt;ref&gt;"''[http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/saoc52.pdf A Late Period Hieratic Wisdom Text: P. Brooklyn 47.218.135"]'', Richard Jasnow, p. 95, University of Chicago Press, 1992, {{ISBN|978-0-918986-85-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient India ===

==== Sanskrit tradition ====
In ''[[Mahabharata|Mahābhārata]]'', the ancient epic of India, there is a discourse in which the wise minister Vidura advises the King Yuddhiśhṭhira
{{quote|Listening to wise scriptures, austerity, sacrifice, respectful faith, social welfare, forgiveness, purity of intent, compassion, truth and self-control—are the ten wealth of character (self). O king aim for these, may you be steadfast in these qualities. These are the basis of prosperity and rightful living. These are highest attainable things. All worlds are balanced on ''dharma'', ''dharma'' encompasses ways to prosperity as well. O King, ''dharma'' is the best quality to have, wealth the medium and desire (''kāma'') the lowest. Hence, (keeping these in mind), by self-control and by making ''dharma'' (right conduct) your main focus, treat others as you treat yourself.| ''Mahābhārata Shānti-Parva'' 167:9}}

==== Tamil tradition ====
In Chapter 32 in the [[Aram (Kural book)|Part on Virtue]] of the [[Tirukkuṛaḷ]] (c. 200 BC – c. 500 AD), [[Tiruvalluvar]] says: "Do not do to others what you know has hurt yourself" (K. 316.); "Why does one hurt others knowing what it is to be hurt?" (K. 318). He furthermore opined that it is the determination of the spotless (virtuous) not to do evil, even in return, to those who have cherished enmity and done them evil. (K. 312) The (proper) punishment to those who have done evil (to you), is to put them to shame by showing them kindness, in return and to forget both the evil and the good done on both sides (K. 314)

=== Ancient Greece ===
The Golden Rule in its prohibitive (negative) form was a common principle in [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[Greek philosophy|philosophy]]. Examples of the general concept include:
* "Avoid doing what you would blame others for doing."&amp;nbsp;– [[Thales]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laërtius]], "The Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers", I:36&lt;/ref&gt;  (c. 624 BC – c. 546 BC)
* "What you do not want to happen to you, do not do it yourself either. "&amp;nbsp;– [[Sentences of Sextus|Sextus the Pythagorean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/sent.html|title=The Sentences of Sextus}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest extant reference to Sextus is by Origen in the third century of the common era.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sentences of Sextus|''The Sentences of Sextus Article'']]&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Do not do to others that which angers you when they do it to you."&amp;nbsp;– [[Isocrates]]&lt;ref&gt;Isocrates, ''Nicocles or the Cyprians''&lt;!--not to be confused with the work ''To Nicocles''--&gt;, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0144%3Aspeech%3D3%3Asection%3D61 Isoc 3.61] ([https://archive.org/stream/2139247.0001.001.umich.edu#page/70/mode/2up original text in Greek]); cf.

=== Ancient Persia ===
The [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi Texts]] of [[Zoroastrianism]] (c. 300 BC–1000 AD) were an early source for the Golden Rule: "That nature alone is good which refrains from doing to another whatsoever is not good for itself." Dadisten-I-dinik, 94,5, and "Whatever is disagreeable to yourself do not do unto others."

[[Seneca the Younger]] (c. 4 BC–65 AD), a practitioner of [[Stoicism]] (c. 300 BC–200 AD) expressed the Golden Rule in his essay regarding the treatment of slaves: "Treat your inferior as you would wish your superior to treat you."&lt;ref&gt;"''[https://www.amazon.com/Stoic-Philosophy-Seneca-Essays-Letters/dp/0393004597/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1461574923&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+stoic+philosophy+of+seneca 41.

According to [[Simon Blackburn]], the Golden Rule "can be found in some form in almost every ethical tradition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|page= 101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Judaism ====
{{See also|Judaism|Jewish ethics}}
A rule of altruistic reciprocity was first stated positively in a well-known Torah verse (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|ואהבת לרעך כמוך}}):
{{quote|You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against your kinsfolk. Love your neighbor as yourself: I am the LORD.|{{bibleverse||Leviticus|19:18|JP}}}}

[[Hillel the Elder]] (c. 110 BC – 10 AD),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=730&amp;letter=H Jewish Encyclopedia: Hillel]: "His activity of forty years is perhaps historical; and since it began, according to a trustworthy tradition (Shab. 15a), one hundred years before the destruction of Jerusalem, it must have covered the period 30 BC–10 AD&lt;!--B.C. in the original--&gt;"&lt;/ref&gt; used this verse as a most important message of the [[Torah]] for his teachings. Once, he was challenged by a gentile who asked to be converted under the condition that the Torah be explained to him while he stood on one foot. Hillel accepted him as a candidate for [[conversion to Judaism]] but, drawing on {{bibleverse||Leviticus|19:18|JP}}, briefed the man:
{{quote|What is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow: this is the whole Torah; the rest is the explanation; go and learn.|{{sourcetext|source=Babylonian Talmud|version=|book=Shabbath|chapter=folio|verse=31a}}|[[Babylonian Talmud]]}}

Hillel recognized brotherly love as the fundamental principle of Jewish ethics. [[Rabbi Akiva]] agreed and suggested that the principle of love must have its foundation in Genesis chapter 1, which teaches that all men are the offspring of Adam, who was made in the image of God ([[Sifra]], Ḳedoshim, iv.; Yer. Ned. ix. 41c; [[Genesis Rabba]] 24).&lt;ref name="a" /&gt; According to [[Adam in rabbinic literature|Jewish rabbinic literature]], the first man [[Adam]] represents the ''unity of mankind''. This is echoed in the modern preamble of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights#Preamble|Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Sanhedrin.4?lang=en|title=Mishnah Seder Nezikin Sanhedrin 4.5|publisher=sefaria.org|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toseftaonline.org/Tractate-Sanhedrin-chapter-8-tosefta-4|title=Tosefta on Mishnah Seder Nezikin Sanhedrin 8.4–9 (Erfurt Manuscript)|publisher=toseftaonline.org|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; And it is also taught, that Adam is last in order according to the evolutionary character of God's creation:&lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=758&amp;letter=A&amp;search=adam#1 |title=ADAM |publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com |accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Why was only a single specimen of man created first? To teach us that he who destroys a single soul destroys a whole world and that he who saves a single soul saves a whole world; furthermore, so no race or class may claim a nobler ancestry, saying, 'Our father was born first'; and, finally, to give testimony to the greatness of the Lord, who caused the wonderful diversity of mankind to emanate from one type. And why was Adam created last of all beings? To teach him humility; for if he be overbearing, let him remember that the little fly preceded him in the order of creation.&lt;ref name="a" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Jewish Publication Society's edition of [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]] states:&lt;blockquote&gt;Thou shalt not hate thy brother. in thy heart; thou shalt surely rebuke thy neighbour, and not bear sin because of him. 18 Thou shalt not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Torah|publisher=Jewish Publication Society|page=19:17|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/jps/lev019.htm|chapter=Leviticus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This Torah verse represents one of several versions of the ''Golden Rule'', which itself appears in various forms, positive and negative. It is the earliest written version of that concept in a positive form.&lt;ref name="Plaut p. 892"&gt;[[Gunther Plaut|Plaut]], ''The Torah&amp;nbsp;– A Modern Commentary''; Union of American Hebrew Congregations, New York 1981; p. 892.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the eras, the Jewish rabbis were discussing the scope of the meaning of Leviticus 19:18 and 19:34 extensively:

{{quote|The [[Ger toshav|stranger who resides with you]] shall be to you as one of your citizens; you shall love him as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt: I the LORD am your God.|{{bibleverse||Leviticus|19:34|JP}}}}

Commentators summed up foreigners (= Samaritans), proselytes (= 'strangers who resides with you') (Rabbi Akiva, bQuid 75b) or Jews (Rabbi Gamaliel, yKet 3, 1; 27a) to the scope of the meaning.

On the verse, "Love your fellow as yourself," the classic commentator [[Rashi]] quotes from Torat Kohanim, an early Midrashic text regarding the famous dictum of Rabbi Akiva: "Love your fellow as yourself&amp;nbsp;– Rabbi Akiva says this is a great principle of the Torah."&lt;ref&gt;Kedoshim 19:18, Toras Kohanim, ibid. See also Talmud Yerushalmi, Nedarim 9:4; Bereishis Rabbah 24:7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Postage stamps and postal history of Israel|Israel's postal service]] quoted from the previous Leviticus verse when it commemorated the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] on a 1958 [[postage stamp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://marbl.library.emory.edu/DigitalExhibits/stamps/015.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407164111/http://marbl.library.emory.edu/DigitalExhibits/stamps/015.html |archivedate=7 April 2008 |title=Sol Singer Collection of Philatelic Judaica |publisher= [[Emory University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Golden Rule" was given by [[Jesus of Nazareth]] ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+7%3A12&amp;version=NCV Matthew 7:12 NCV], see also [[s:Bible (King James)/Luke#6:31|Luke 6:31]]). The common English phrasing is "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you".

The Golden Rule is stated positively numerous times in the [[Old Testament]]:  {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Leviticus|chapter=19|verse=18}} ("Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD."; see also [[Great Commandment]]) and {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Leviticus|chapter=19|verse=34}} ("But treat them just as you treat your own citizens. Love foreigners as you love yourselves, because you were foreigners one time in Egypt. I am the Lord your God.").

The [[Old Testament]] [[Deuterocanonical]] books of [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]] and [[Sirach]], accepted as part of the Scriptural canon by [[Catholicism|Catholic Church]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]], and the [[Non-Chalcedonian]] Churches, express a negative form of the golden rule:

{{quote|"Do to no one what you yourself dislike."|Tobit 4:15}}
{{quote|"Recognize that your neighbor feels as you do, and keep in mind your own dislikes."|Sirach 31:15}}

Two passages in the [[New Testament]] quote [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] espousing the positive form of the Golden rule:

[[Matthew 7:12]]
{{quote|Do to others what you want them to do to you. This is the meaning of the law of Moses and the teaching of the prophets.}}

{{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Luke|chapter=6|verse=31}}
{{quote|Do to others what you would want them to do to you.}}

A similar passage, a parallel to the [[Great Commandment]], is {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=New International Readers Version|book=Luke|chapter=10|verse=25|range=-28}}

{{quote|&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;And one day an authority on the law stood up to put Jesus to the test. "Teacher," he asked, "what must I do to receive eternal life?"
&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;What is written in the Law?" Jesus replied. "How do you understand it?"
&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;He answered, " ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul. Love him with all your strength and with all your mind.’(Deuteronomy 6:5) And, ‘Love your neighbor as you love yourself.’ "
&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;"You have answered correctly," Jesus replied. "Do that, and you will live.".}}

The passage in the book of Luke then continues with Jesus answering the question, "Who is my neighbor?", by telling the parable of the [[Good Samaritan]], indicating that "your neighbor" is anyone in need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christnotes.org/commentary.php?b=42&amp;c=10&amp;com=wes |title=John Wesley's Explanatory Notes on Luke 10 |publisher=Christnotes.org |accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This extends to all, including those who are generally considered hostile.

Jesus' teaching goes beyond the negative formulation of not doing what one would not like done to themselves, to the positive formulation of actively doing good to another that, if the situations were reversed, one would desire that the other would do for them. This formulation, as indicated in the parable of the Good Samaritan, emphasizes the needs for positive action that brings benefit to another, not simply restraining oneself from negative activities that hurt another.&lt;ref&gt;Moore: Judaism in the First Centuries of the Christian Era; Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 1927–1930; Vol. 2, p. 87, Vol. 3, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

In one passage of the [[New Testament]], [[Paul the Apostle]] refers to the golden rule:

{{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Galatians|chapter=5|verse=14 | Galatians 5:14 }}
{{quote|&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.}}

==== Islam ====
{{See also|Islamic ethics}}

The Arabian peninsula was known to not practice the golden rule prior to the advent of Islam.  "Pre-Islamic Arabs regarded the survival of the tribe, as most essential and to be ensured by the ancient rite of blood vengeance"{{according to whom|date=May 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Th.

However, this all changed when Muhammad came on the scene:
{{quote|Fakir al-Din al-Razi and several other Qur'anic commentators have pointed out that Qur'an 83:1-6 is an implicit statement of the Golden Rule, which is explicitly stated in the tradition, "Pay, Oh Children of Adam, as you would love to be paid, and be just as you would love to have justice!" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Th.

{{quote|Similar examples of the golden rule are found in the hadith of the prophet Muhammad.

From the [[hadith]], the collected oral and written accounts of Muhammad and his teachings during his lifetime:
{{quote|A Bedouin came to the prophet, grabbed the stirrup of his camel and said: O the messenger of God! Teach me something to go to heaven with it. Prophet said: "As you would have people do to you, do to them; and what you dislike to be done to you, don't do to them. Now let the stirrup go!"

==== Jainism ====
{{See also|Jainism|Ahimsa in Jainism}}

The Golden Rule is paramount in the Jainist philosophy and can be seen in the doctrines of [[Ahimsa in Jainism|Ahimsa]] and [[Karma in Jainism|Karma]]. As part of the prohibition of causing any living beings to suffer, Jainism forbids inflicting upon others what is harmful to oneself.

The following quotation from the [[Acaranga Sutra]] sums up the philosophy of Jainism:
{{Quote|Nothing which breathes, which exists, which lives, or which has essence or potential of life, should be destroyed or ruled over, or subjugated, or harmed, or denied of its essence or potential.

In support of this Truth, I ask you a question – ''"Is sorrow or pain desirable to you ?"'' If you say ''"yes it is"'', it would be a lie. If you say, ''"No, It is not"'' you will be expressing the truth. '''Just as sorrow or pain is not desirable to you, so it is to all which breathe, exist, live or have any essence of life.''' To you and all, it is undesirable, and painful, and repugnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Jacobi | first =Hermann | title =Ācāranga Sūtra, Jain Sutras Part I, Sacred Books of the East, Vol. 22. | year= 1884 | url =http://www.sacred-texts.com/jai/sbe22/index.htm}} Sutra 155–6&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|A man should wander about treating all creatures as he himself would be treated. | [[Sutrakritanga]] |''1.11.33''}}

{{Quote|In happiness and suffering, in joy and grief, we should regard all creatures as we regard our own self.|Lord Mahavira|24th Tirthankara}}

Dixit | title ={{IAST|Samaṇ Suttaṁ}} | publisher =Bhagwan Mahavir memorial Samiti | year= 1993 | location =New Delhi }}&lt;/ref&gt; gives further insight into this precept:-

{{Quote|Just as pain is not agreeable to you, it is so with others. Knowing this principle of equality treat other with respect and compassion.|Suman Suttam|''verse 150''}}

{{Quote|Killing a living being is killing one's own self; showing compassion to a living being is showing compassion to oneself. He who desires his own good, should avoid causing any harm to a living being. |Suman Suttam|''verse 151''}}

The same idea is also presented in V.12 and VI.30 of the ''[[Analects]]'' (c. 500 BC), which can be found in the online [[Chinese Text Project]]. The phraseology differs from the Christian version of the Golden Rule. It does not presume to do anything unto others, but merely to avoid doing what would be harmful. It does not preclude doing good deeds and taking moral positions, but there is slim possibility for a Confucian missionary outlook, such as one can justify with the Christian Golden Rule.

Mozi regarded the golden rule as a corollary to the cardinal virtue of impartiality, and encouraged [[egalitarianism]] and selflessness in relationships.

In the view of [[Greg M. Epstein]], a [[Secular humanism|Humanist]] [[chaplain]] at [[Harvard University]], " 'do unto others'&amp;nbsp;... is a concept that essentially no religion misses entirely. ''But not a single one of these versions of the golden rule requires a God''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Good Without God: What a Billion Nonreligious People Do Believe|edition= |last= Esptein|first= Greg M.|year= 2010|publisher= HarperCollins|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-06-167011-4|page= 115}} Italics in original.&lt;/ref&gt; Various sources identify the Golden Rule as a humanist principle:&lt;ref name="Thinkhumanism.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkhumanism.com/the-golden-rule.html |title=Thinkhumanism.com |publisher=Thinkhumanism.com |accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.ubc.ca/Clubs/humanist/ |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020914042919/http://www.ams.ubc.ca/clubs/humanist/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 September 2002 |title=UBC.ca |date=15 March 2008 |accessdate=12 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Trying to live according to the Golden Rule means trying to empathise with other people, including those who may be very different from us. Empathy is at the root of kindness, compassion, understanding and respect&amp;nbsp;– qualities that we all appreciate being shown, whoever we are, whatever we think and wherever we come from. And although it isn’t possible to know what it really feels like to be a different person or live in different circumstances and have different life experiences, it isn’t difficult for most of us to imagine what would cause us suffering and to try to avoid causing suffering to others. For this reason many people find the Golden Rule’s corollary&amp;nbsp;– "do not treat people in a way you would not wish to be treated yourself"&amp;nbsp;– more pragmatic.&lt;ref name="Thinkhumanism.com" /&gt;|sign=Maria MacLachlan|source=Think Humanism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkhumanism.com/ |title=Think Humanism |publisher=Think Humanism |accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|Do not do to others what you would not want them to do to you. ''[is] (…)'' the single greatest, simplest, and most important moral axiom humanity has ever invented, one which reappears in the writings of almost every culture and religion throughout history, the one we know as the Golden Rule.

Moral directives do not need to be complex or obscure to be worthwhile, and in fact, it is precisely this rule's simplicity which makes it great. It is easy to come up with, easy to understand, and easy to apply, and these three things are the hallmarks of a strong and healthy moral system. The idea behind it is readily graspable: before performing an action which might harm another person, try to imagine yourself in their position, and consider whether you would want to be the recipient of that action. If you would not want to be in such a position, the other person probably would not either, and so you should not do it. It is the basic and fundamental human trait of empathy, the ability to vicariously experience how another is feeling, that makes this possible, and it is the principle of empathy by which we should live our lives.|sign=Adam Lee|source=Ebon Musings, "A decalogue for the modern world"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebonmusings.org/atheism/new10c.html |title=A decalogue for the modern world |publisher=Ebonmusings.org |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Other contexts ==

=== Human rights ===
According to [[Marc H. Bornstein]], and William E. Paden, the Golden Rule is arguably the most essential basis for the modern concept of [[human rights]], in which each individual has a right to just treatment, and a reciprocal responsibility to ensure justice for others.&lt;ref&gt;Defined another way, it "''refers to the balance in an interactive system such that each party has both rights and duties, and the subordinate norm of complementarity states that one's rights are the other's obligation.''"{{cite book|last=Bornstein |first=Marc H.|title=Handbook of Parenting|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|year=2002|page=5|isbn=978-0-8058-3782-7}} See also: {{cite book|last=Paden |first=William E.|title=Interpreting the Sacred: Ways of Viewing Religion|publisher=Beacon Press|year=2003|pages=131–132|isbn=978-0-8070-7705-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However [[Leo Damrosch]] argued that the notion that the Golden Rule pertains to "rights" per se is a contemporary interpretation and has nothing to do with its origin. The development of human "rights" is a modern political ideal that began as a philosophical concept promulgated through the philosophy of [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] in 18th century France, among others. His writings influenced [[Thomas Jefferson]], who then incorporated Rousseau's reference to "inalienable rights" into the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] in 1776. Damrosch argued that to confuse the Golden Rule with human rights is to apply contemporary thinking to ancient concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Science and economics ==
{{further information|Reciprocity (social psychology)|Reciprocal altruism}}

There has been research published arguing that some 'sense' of fair play and the Golden Rule may be stated and rooted in terms of [[Neuroscience|neuroscientific]] and [[Neuroethics|neuroethical]] principles.&lt;ref&gt;Pfaff, Donald W., "The Neuroscience of Fair Play: Why We (Usually) Follow the Golden Rule", Dana Press, The Dana Foundation, New York, 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-932594-27-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Golden Rule can also be explained from the perspectives of psychology, philosophy, sociology, human evolution, and economics. Psychologically, it involves a person [[Empathy|empathizing]] with others. Philosophically, it involves a person perceiving their neighbor also as "I" or "self".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Golden Rule |last1=Wattles | first1=Jeffrey | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologically, "love your neighbor as yourself" is applicable between individuals, between groups, and also between individuals and groups.  In evolution, "[[reciprocal altruism]]" is seen as a distinctive advance in the capacity of human groups to survive and reproduce, as their exceptional brains demanded exceptionally long childhoods and ongoing provision and protection even beyond that of the immediate family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vogel| first1=Gretchen|title=The Evolution of the Golden Rule|journal=Science|volume=303|issue=Feb 2004|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Golden Rule#Economics|economics]], Richard Swift, referring to ideas from [[David Graeber]], suggests that "without some kind of reciprocity society would no longer be able to exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swift|first1=Richard|title=Pathways &amp; possibilites|journal=New Internationalist|volume=484|issue=July/August 2015|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Philosophers, such as [[Immanuel Kant]]&lt;ref name="Kant" /&gt; and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2007/05/the_golden_rule.html |title=Only a Game: The Golden Rule |publisher=Onlyagame.typepad.com |date=24 May 2007 |accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; have objected to the rule on a variety of grounds. The most serious among these is its application. How does one know how others want to be treated? The obvious way is to ask them, but this cannot be done if one assumes they have not reached a particular and relevant understanding.

=== Differences in values or interests ===
[[George Bernard Shaw]] wrote, "Do not do unto others as you would that they should do unto you. Their tastes may be different."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=George Bernard|title=Man and Superman|date=1903|publisher=Archibald Constable &amp; Co.|page=227|url=https://archive.org/stream/mansupermancomed00shawrich#page/226/mode/2up|accessdate=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that if your values are not shared with others, the way you want to be treated will not be the way they want to be treated. Hence, the Golden Rule of "do unto others" is "dangerous in the wrong hands,"&lt;ref&gt;Source: p. 76 of ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'', [[Iain King]], 2008, Continuum, {{ISBN|978-1-84706-347-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; according to philosopher [[Iain King]], because "some fanatics have no aversion to death: the Golden Rule might inspire them to kill others in suicide missions."&lt;ref&gt;Source: p. 76 of ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'', Iain King, 2008, Continuum, {{ISBN|978-1-84706-347-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Differences in situations ===
[[Immanuel Kant]] famously criticized the golden rule for not being sensitive to differences of situation, noting that a prisoner duly convicted of a crime could appeal to the golden rule while asking the judge to release him, pointing out that the judge would not want anyone else to send him to prison, so he should not do so to others.&lt;ref name="Kant"&gt;Kant, Immanuel ''Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals'', footnote 13. Cambridge University Press (28 April 1998). {{ISBN|978-0-521-62695-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kant's ''[[Categorical imperative|Categorical Imperative]]'', introduced in ''[[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]]'', is often [[Categorical imperative#The Golden Rule|confused with the Golden Rule.]]

=== Cannot be a sole guide to action ===
In his book ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'', philosopher [[Iain King]] has argued that "(although) the idea of mirroring your treatment of others with their treatment of you is very widespread indeed… most ancient wisdoms express this negatively – advice on what you should not do, rather than what you should."&lt;ref&gt;Source: p. 110 of ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'', Iain King, Continuum, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-84706-347-2}}. Accessed 20 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues this creates a bias in favour of inertia which allows bad actions and states of affairs to persist. The positive formulation, meanwhile, can be "incendiary",&lt;ref name="Source 2008"&gt;Source: p. 112 of ''How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time'', Iain King, Continuum, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-84706-347-2}}. Accessed 20 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; since it "can lead to cycles of tit-for-tat reciprocity," unless it is accompanied by a corrective mechanism, such as a concept of forgiveness.&lt;ref name="Source 2008" /&gt; Therefore, he concludes that there can be no viable formulation of the Golden Rule, unless it is heavily qualified by other maxims.&lt;ref&gt;Source: p. 114 of ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'', Iain King, Continuum, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-84706-347-2}}.

=== Responses to criticisms&lt;!--linked from [[The Platinum Rule]]; [[Platinum Rule (principle)]] redirects here--&gt; ===
[[Walter Terence Stace]], in ''The Concept of Morals'' (1937), wrote:

{{quote|Mr. Bernard Shaw's remark "Do not do unto others as you would that they should do unto you. Their tastes may be different" is no doubt a smart saying. But it seems to overlook the fact that "doing as you would be done by" includes taking into account your neighbor's tastes as you would that he should take yours into account. Thus the "golden rule" might still express the essence of a universal morality ''even if no two men in the world had any needs or tastes in common''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Marcus George Singer]] observed that there are two importantly different ways of looking at the golden rule: as requiring (1)&amp;nbsp;that you perform specific actions that you want others to do to you or (2)&amp;nbsp;that you guide your behavior in the same general ways that you want others to.&lt;ref&gt;M. G. Singer, The Ideal of a Rational Morality, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; Counter-examples to the golden rule typically are more forceful against the first than the second.

In his book on the golden rule, Jeffrey Wattles makes the similar observation that such objections typically arise while applying the golden rule in certain general ways (namely, ignoring differences in taste, in situation, and so forth). But if we apply the golden rule to our own method of using it, asking in effect if we would want other people to apply the golden rule in such ways, the answer would typically be no, since it is quite predictable that others' ignoring of such factors will lead to behavior which we object to. It follows that we should not do so ourselves—according to the golden rule. In this way, the golden rule may be self-correcting.&lt;ref&gt;Wattles, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; An article by Jouni Reinikainen develops this suggestion in greater detail.&lt;ref&gt;Jouni Reinikainen, "The Golden Rule and the Requirement of Universalizability." Journal of Value Inquiry. 39(2): 155–168, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible, then, that the golden rule can itself guide us in identifying which differences of situation are morally relevant. We would often want other people to ignore any prejudice against our [[Race (human categorization)|race]] or nationality when deciding how to act towards us, but would also want them to not ignore our differing preferences in food, desire for aggressiveness, and so on. This principle of "doing unto others, wherever possible, as ''they'' would be done by..." has sometimes been termed the [[platinum rule]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Popper]], ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', Vol. 2 (1966 [1945]), p. 386. Dubbed "the platinum rule" in business books such as Charles J. Jacobus, Thomas E. Gillett, ''Georgia Real Estate: An Introduction to the Profession'', Cengage Learning, 2007, p. 409 and Jeremy Comfort, Peter Franklin, ''The Mindful International Manager: How to Work Effectively Across Cultures'', Kogan Page, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gujarat Control of Organised Crime Act (GUJCOCA)''' is a controversial [[anti-terrorism]] legislation passed by the state [[legislature]] of [[Gujarat]], India, in April 2003. It is awaiting [[President of India|Presidential]] approval.

==Introduction and presidential assent==
The bill was drawn on the lines of the [[Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act]] (for [[Maharashtra]]) and Karnataka Control of Organised Crime Act (for [[Karnataka]]).&lt;ref name="expressindia1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/united-against-terror-bjp-deserters-back-modi-stance-on-gujcoc-bill/360759/ |title=BJP deserters back Modi stance on GUJCOC Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then sent to the office of the [[President of India]] for assent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/jaipur-blasts-revive-debate-over-gujcoc-bill/310482/ |title=Jaipur blasts revive debate over GUJCOC Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was returned to the state legislature suggesting certain  amendments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=187342 |title=You can’t sit on GUJCOC Bill, State tells Centre |publisher=expressindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://in.rediff.com/news/2004/jun/02guj.htm |title=Gujarat gets new anti-terror law |publisher=rediff.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was passed again by the state legislature after deleting the provisions relating to interception of communication as suggested by the then President, [[A. P. J. Abdul Kalam|Dr. A P J Kalam]] and sent back for approval.

The bill was sent back to the state in December 2008 with suggestions of further amendments, but the President's office recalled the file back shortly in January 2009 saying it wanted to have another look.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/home-wants-to-have-another-look-at-gujarat-antiterror-law-recalls-file/409607/ |title=Home wants to have another look at Gujarat anti-terror law, recalls file}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009&lt;ref name="gujcoc_change_june_2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Centre-returns-GUJCOC-Bill--asks-state-to-amend-3-clauses/478913 |title=Centre returns GUJCOC Bill, asks state to amend 3 clauses}}&lt;/ref&gt; the bill was returned to the state with recommendations to make following amendments to 3 clauses.

# Delete Clause 16 - Clause 16 relates to the confession made before a police officer being admissible in court&lt;ref name="gujcoc_change_june_2009" /&gt;
# Substitute the word “may” for “shall” after the words Special Court occurring in clause 20(2) and bring the proviso in line with the proviso to Section 43 D (2) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act(Amendment), 2008,  - Clause 20 (2) deals with the extension of the detention period&lt;ref name="gujcoc_change_june_2009" /&gt;

In July 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-07-28/india/28166240_1_gujarat-control-gujcoc-bill-anti-terror-bill |title=Gujarat passes anti-terror bill, rejects President's suggestions |publisher=Times of India | date=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the bill was re-introduced in the state legislature without the changes suggested by the President and passed.

The phrase '''Her Majesty's Government''' (''His Majesty's Government'' during the reign of a male monarch) is a formal term referring to the [[government]] of a [[Commonwealth realm]] or one of constituent provinces, states or territories. In use since at least the height of the [[British Empire]], the phrase has been inherited and integrated into the countries that emerged from that polity.

==History==
In the [[British Empire]], the term ''His (or Her) Majesty's Government'' was originally only used by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|imperial government]] in [[London]]. As the Empire developed into the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the former [[Dominion]]s came to be seen as realms of the sovereign equal in status to the [[United Kingdom]], and, from the 1920s and 1930s, the form ''His Majesty's Government in...'' began to be used by the United Kingdom and Dominion governments to differentiate between independent jurisdictions, such as [[His Majesty's Government in the Irish Free State]].&lt;ref name=Walshe&gt;{{Citation| last=Walshe| first=Joseph P.| author-link=Joe Walshe| title=Documents on Irish Foreign Policy &gt; Despatch from Joseph P.

Today, however, most Commonwealth realm governments, other than that of the UK (where the abbreviation ''HMG'' is frequently used), have reverted to predominantly using the form ''Government of [region]'', with ''Her Majesty's Government'' being typically employed in formal circumstances. Within federations, such as [[Canada]] and [[Australia]], disambiguation between federal, provincial, or state governments is sometimes required—for instance, a 1989 [[Supreme Court of Canada|Canadian Supreme Court]] decision refers to "Her Majesty's Government for the Province of [[Nova Scotia]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court| url=http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1989/1989rcs2-796/1989rcs2-796.html| litigants=Mackeigan v.

'''Information policy''' is the set of all public laws, regulations and policies that encourage, discourage, or regulate the creation, use, storage, access, and communication and dissemination of [[information]].&lt;ref&gt;Weingarten, F.W. (1989) Federal Information Policy Development: The Congressional perspective. In C. McClure, P. Hernon and H. Relyea (eds), United States Government Information Policies: views and Perspectives (Ablex, Norwood, NJ).&lt;/ref&gt; It thus encompasses any other decision-making practice with society-wide constitutive efforts that involve the flow of information and how it is processed.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"&gt;Braman, S. (2011). Defining information policy. Journal of Information Policy 1-5. http://jip.vmhost.psu.edu/ojs/index.php/jip/article/view/19/14.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several fundamental issues that comprise information policy. Most prominent are [[public policy]] issues concerned with the use of information for democratization and commercialization of social life. These issues include, inter alia, digital environment, such as [[intellectual property]], economic regulations, freedom of expression, confidentiality or privacy of information, [[information security]], access management, and regulating how the dissemination of public information occurs.

== Overview ==

Information policy became a prominent field of study during the latter half of the 20th century as the shift from an industrial to an information society transpired.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt; It has since then evolved from being seen as relatively unimportant to having a much more overarching strategic significance since it establishes the conditions “under which all other decision making, public discourse, and political activity occur.”&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt; The growing awareness in the importance of information policy has sparked an interest in various groups to further study and analyze its magnitude. The most common audience for information policy analysis includes undergraduate and graduate students, scholars, policymakers, policy analysts, as well as those members of the public who have taken an interest in understanding the effects of the laws and regulations involving information.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt;

Although information policy generally has a broader definition and encapsulates a multitude of components, its scope and impact can vary depending on the context. For example, in the context of an information lifecycle, information policy refers to the laws and policies that deal with the stages information goes through beginning with its creation, through its collection, organization, dissemination, and finally to its destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, Marilyn Gell. (1983). The federal role in library and information services. White Plains, N.Y.: Knowledge Industry Publishers Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in the context of public administration, information policy is the means by which government employees, institutions, and information systems adapt themselves to an environment in rapid fluctuation and use information for decision-making (e.g., Andersen and Dawes, 1991; also see Bozeman and Bretschneider, 1986, and Stevens and McGowan, 1985). One can see how these two contexts offer varying scopes for the phrase “ information policy.”

Information policy is in fact, a combination of several varying disciplines including [[information sciences|information science]], [[economics]], law, and public policy.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt; Thus, its scope may differ when each of these disciplines analyses or uses it. The information sciences may be more concerned with technical advances and how this impacts information policy, while from a law perspective, issues such as privacy rights and intellectual property may be of greatest focus.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, M. W. (1995) Information Policies: premonitions and prospects. Journal of Information Science 21(4) 273-282.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History==

The earliest sight of information policy was present around the mid-1900s.  The stages to begin evolving from an industrial society to an information society sparked several other transformations.  The common industrial technologies were beginning to be replaced by informational meta-technologies.  Organizations began changing their form, several new architectures of knowledge developed, and most importantly, the information economy replaced industrial and agricultural economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pantherfile.uwm.edu/braman/www/bramanpdfs/027_Braman_Chapt1.pdf |title=University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee |publisher=Pantherfile.uwm.edu |date= |accessdate=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s, the concept of national information policy was created to protect the data and information that was used in creating public policies. The earliest adopters of information policy included the United States, Australia, as well as several European countries who all recognized the importance for a more standardized governance of information.

Elizabeth Orna contributed to a paper on information policies by providing a brief history of the development of ideas surrounding national and organizational information policies, from the beginning when the [[United Kingdom]] Ministry of Information was established in the [[World War I|First World War]] to present day. The history of information policy is reflected in this chart.

In the 20th century, to cope with the privacy problems of databases, information policy evolved further safeguards. In the USA, the federal [[Privacy Act of 1974|Privacy Act]] provides individuals the right to inspect and correct personal information in federal datafiles.

== Types and importance ==

The types of information policy can be separated into two different categories.  It can be discussed in the short-term focus exclusively on information science.  It can also have a much broader context in relation to different subjects and be within a larger time period, for example dating back to Roman civilization, the Bill of Rights, or the Constitution.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt;

The obvious reason for the need of information policy deals with the legal issues that can be associated with the advancement of technology.  More precisely, — the digitization of the cultural content made the cost of the copy decreasing to nearly zero and increased the illegal exchange of files, online, via sharing web site or [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|P2P]] technologies, or off line (copy of hard disks).  As a result, there are many grey areas between what users can and cannot do, and this creates the need for some sort of regulation.  Today, this has led to the creation of SOPA ([[Stop Online Piracy Act]]).  Information policy will mark the boundaries needed to evaluate certain issues dealing with the creation, processing, exchange, access, and use of information.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt;

1. for avoiding risks (financial losses from incomplete and uncoordinated exploitation of information, wasted time, failures of innovation, and reputation loss);

2. for positive benefits, including negotiation and openness among those responsible for different aspects of information management
 
3. productive use of IT in supporting staff in their use of information

4. ability to initiate change to take advantage of changing environments

== Issues ==

There are some issues around organizational information policies,&lt;ref&gt;Orna Elizabeth, Information Policies, yesterday, today and tomorrow, Journal of Information Science, 34 (4) 2008, pp 547-565, apud N. Moore and J. Steel, Information-Intensive Britain. British Library R &amp; D report No. 6038 (The Policy Studies Institute/British Library Board, London, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; which are the interaction between human beings and technology for using information, the issue to proceed information policy itself, whether top-down or middle-up-down, is the best way to approach information policy in an organization. Also, issues that information tends to be influenced by organization’s culture that result in complexity of information flow. Moreover, the concern about valuing information is discussed by Orna, the fact that value of information is dependant on the user, and it can’t be measured by price. Considering that information is an asset or intellectual capital that becomes valuable when it is used in productive ways.

== Convergence==
Convergence essentially combines all forms of media, telecommunications, broadcasting, and computing by the use of a single technology: digital computers.&lt;ref name="MacInnes 2002"&gt;(Garcia-Murillo and MacInnes, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  It integrates diverse technological systems in the hopes of improving performance of similar tasks.  Convergence is thought to be the result of the need for expansion into new markets due to competition and technological advances that have created a threat of new entrants into various segments of the value chain.&lt;ref name="MacInnes 2002"/&gt; As a result, previously disparate technologies interact with one other synergistically to deliver information in new and unique ways and allow for inventive solutions to be developed.

Nearly every innovative trend in the social industry involves adding data or layers of connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;(Stanchak, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Social networking sites have begun interacting with e-mail functionalities, search engines have begun integrating Internet searches with Facebook data, Twitter along with various other social media platforms have started to play a prominent role in the emergency management framework (mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery) among several others.

In 2012 a prominent issue arose that deals with the convergence of social media with copyright infringement monitoring systems.&lt;ref name="Reisinger, 2012"&gt;(Reisinger, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;  The growing interest in this topic can be largely attributed to the recent anti-piracy bills: the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] and the [[PROTECT IP Act]]. Various officials from all over the world have expressed an interest in forcing social networks to install and utilize monitoring systems to determine if users are illegally obtaining copyrighted material.&lt;ref name="Reisinger, 2012"/&gt; For example, if implemented, these filters could prevent the illegal sharing of music over social networking platforms. The convergence of search engines and social networks could make this process even easier. Search engines such as Google, Yahoo, and Bing have begun to merge with social media platforms to link Internet searches to your social networking sites such as Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;(Houck, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; This poses an even greater threat to users since their Internet searches can be monitored via their social networks.

The issue of converging social networks with piracy monitoring systems becomes controversial when it comes to protecting personal data and abiding by [[privacy law]]s. In order for a synergy such as this one to take place, regulatory convergence would need to be considered. Regulatory convergence is the merging of previously disparate industry-based laws and regulations into a single legal and regulatory framework.&lt;ref name="MacInnes 2002"/&gt;

== Internet governance ==

Internet governance has both narrow and broad definitions, thus, making it a complex concept to understand. When most people think of Internet governance, they think of the regulations of the content and conduct that are communicated and acted on through the Internet.&lt;ref name="Solum, 2008, p. 50"&gt;Solum, 2008, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Although this is certainly a broad component of Internet governance, additionally, there are more narrow elements to the definition that are often overlooked. Internet governance also encompasses the regulation of Internet infrastructure and the processes, systems, and institutions that regulate the fundamental systems that determine the capabilities of the Internet.&lt;ref name="Solum, 2008, p. 50"/&gt;

Architecture is the foundation of the Internet. The fundamental goal of the Internet architecture is to essentially create a network of networks by interconnecting various computer network systems globally.&lt;ref name="Solum, 2008, 68"&gt;(Solum, 2008, 68)&lt;/ref&gt; Protocols such as TCP/IP as well as other network protocols serve as the rules and conventions by which computers can communicate with each other.&lt;ref&gt;(Solum, 2008, 67)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, TCP/IP is often viewed as the most important institution of Internet governance.&lt;ref name="Solum, 2008, 68"/&gt; It serves as the backbone to network connectivity.
 
Organizations such as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ([[ICANN]]) coordinate the various systems within the Internet on a global level to help preserve the operational stability of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;(Solum, 2008, 48)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, coordination of IP addresses and managing the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) ensure computers and devices can correctly connect to the Internet and can communicate effectively globally. If regulation of these crucial elements of the Internet such as TCP/IP and DNS were governed by disparate principles, the Internet would no longer exist as it does today. Networks, computers, and peripherals would not be able to communicate and have the same accessibility if these foundational elements varied.

== Government roles ==

Like with any policy, there needs to be an agent to govern and regulate it. With information policy in a broader sense, the government has several roles and responsibilities. Some examples include providing accurate information, producing and maintaining information that meets the specific needs of the public, protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personal and sensitive information, and making informed decisions on which information should be disseminated and how to distribute it effectively, among others.&lt;ref&gt;Browne, M. (1997) The Field of Information Policy: 1. Fundamental Concepts, Journal of Information Science 23(4) 261-275&lt;/ref&gt; Although the government plays an active role in information policy, the analysis of information policy should not only include the formal decision making processes by government entities, but also the formal and informal decisions of both the private and public sector of governance.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt;

=== Security vs freedom of information ===

A persistent debate concerning the government role in information policy is the separation of security and freedom of information.  Legislation such as the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USAPATRIOT or USAPA) Act of 2001 is an example of security taking precedence over civil liberties.  The USAPA affected several surveillance and privacy laws to include:&lt;ref name=EPIC&gt;{{cite web|title=USA PATRIOT Act|url=http://epic.org/privacy/terrorism/usapatriot|accessdate=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Wire Tapping (Title III) which requires there be probable cause for real-time interception of voice and data communication.&lt;ref name="EPIC"/&gt;
* Electronic Communications Privacy Act(ECPA) regulates government access to email and other electronic communications.&lt;ref name="EPIC"/&gt;
* Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) authorizes the government to carry out electronic surveillance against any person, including Americans.&lt;ref name="EPIC"/&gt;
The USAPA was passed in October 2001, not long after 9/11 and without much contention from congress.  Civil liberties advocates argue that the changes made to the standing surveillance laws were done in an abrupt manner and without consideration to basic rights as outlined in the US constitution, specifically [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|fourth amendment]] rights which protects against unreasonable search and seizure.

== Research methods and tools ==

The five broad methodological strands that Rowlands (1996) identified are current tools for information policy study:

Classification: The tool demonstrates a wide range of issues and subjects on information policy. It helps research to understand the breadth of the subject. The published materials are reasonably well documented and described. It is also good for start-up literature review and research purposes.

Identification of policy issues and options: This tool relies on inputs for information; for example, interviews and questionnaires targeting policy makers and other stakeholders. It is a commonly used in the studies of on-the-job policy makers in government or industry (Moore and Steele, 1991; McIntosh, 1990; Rowlands, 1997).

Reductionism: The reductionist approach control factors to reduce ambiguity. The factors include constraining data collection, analysis and interpretation within the framework of a specific discipline. It helps researchers to notice how a specific factor relates to the overall environment. 
Forecasting and scenario-building: The commonly used model is [[PEST analysis|STEEP framework]]. It helps in reducing uncertainties for a topic that is under studies.

Process-oriented research and cases studies: It provides detailed contextual analyses of particular events. It helps researcher to experience the policy process in semi-real situation and study its outcome.

== The future ==

In regards to the future of information policy, it should be flexible and changing to different circumstances as the ability to access, store, and share information grows.&lt;ref&gt;Galvin, T.J. (1994). Rights in Conflict: public policy in an information age. In: New Worlds in Information and Documentation : Proceedings of the 46th FID Conference and Congress&lt;/ref&gt;  Galvin suggests that information policy might include setting a boundary to the uncertainty in this field.  As information policy becomes a larger and more important topic, it will also become a greater subject to governmental regulation in regards to the future of technology as well.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt;  It will also include the studies of these subjects: information science, communications, library science, and technology studies.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt;

The information policies will earn more advantages for national and organizational, such as getting the best from development of [[Web 2.0]] nationally and in organization, influence people for paying attention to the socio aspect and socio-technical system, for securing preservation of digital content, bringing out information product, also respecting all users and making thinking time respectable.

In order to achieve this national organization, it will be important to focus not only on a domestic level but also nationally. Making domestic agencies cooperate internationally (and vice versa) though, will not be overly successful. A single nation can take the lead in establishing communication-based relationships specifically regarding the internet. These relations will need to be slowly and consistently established in order to truly unify any kind of information policy and decision-making. If information policy can be established and guided on a semi-national level, the degree of communication and cooperation throughout the world will increase dramatically. As information policy continues to shape many aspects of society, these international relations will become vital (Harpham, 2011).

Information policy is playing a greater role in the economy leading to the production of goods and services, as well as selling them directly to consumers (UCLA, 2009).  The cost of information varies from a tangible good in that initial costs of the first unit are large and fixed; however, after that, marginal costs are relatively low (MacInnes, 2011).  As an increase from the information services, information can be paralleled to that of manufacturing several years ago (UCLA, 2009).  The digitalization of information allows businesses to make better justified business decisions (MacInnes, 2011).

: ''This article is about the history of ethnic Jews and political radicalism. For the antisemitic canard, see [[Jewish Bolshevism]].''

The historical contribution of Jews to the political Left has been well documented. Both as individual theorists and activists of the stature of [[Karl Marx]], [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]], [[Léon Blum]] and [[Emma Goldman]], and as organised mass labour movements in, for example, revolutionary Russia and early-mid twentieth century Warsaw, Amsterdam, Paris, Toronto, New York and London, Jews have been conspicuous for their socialist and communist affiliations.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Historical analysis of the dynamics of this Jewish/Left alliance, however, has been far less conclusive. Considerable dissonance exists, for example, concerning the factors which attracted Jews to the Left, the extent to which leading Jewish Left activists were originally motivated by or subsequently influenced by explicitly Jewish concerns, and the degree to which one can reasonably speak of a specific or unique Jewish contribution to the international Left. In addition, discussion of these factors has often been inhibited by concerns regarding the use of the alleged Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy by the Nazis and other anti-Semitic groups.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

According to Paul Johnson, Jewish society in the last 1,500 years has been designed to produce and support intellectuals who largely focused their talents on rabbinical studies.  Johnson asserts that "quite suddenly, around the year 1800, this ancient and highly efficient social machine for the production of intellectuals began to shift its output. Instead of pouring all its products into the closed circuit of rabbinical studies, . . . it unleashed a significant and ever-growing proportion of them into secular life. This was an event of shattering importance in world history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of the Jews |first=Paul |last=Johnson |year=1988 |pages=340–341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[French Revolution|French Revolution of 1789]] promised equality, freedom, and an end to discrimination for all including the Jews. The subsequent political emancipation of the Jews in most of Western and Central Europe provoked an anti-modern and specifically anti-Jewish backlash from traditional conservative groupings. In response, Jews allied themselves with the modern liberalist forces, and played an important role in the 1848 European revolutions which sought to entrench the gains of liberalism. However, the ensuing failure of liberalism to protect Jewish rights led many Jews to seek new allies within the growing working-class movement. The international character of the socialist movement seemingly offered Jews protection from old religious and national hatreds. Thus in contrast to most other national groups, Jews had a double reason to join the proletarian revolution. They were discriminated against both on class grounds and on racial grounds.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Not surprisingly, many Jews made a rational decision to join a movement which promised to defend and extend the equal rights granted by the French Revolution. The prominence of Jews in the Left can, therefore, be attributed to reasons of self-interest as much as to any idealistic motivation. Equally, the subsequent decline of Jewish involvement in the Left can be attributed to relatively objective factors such as the creation of the State of Israel which transformed Jewish dependence from international to national forces.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==20th century==
Many young Jews rejected the Orthodoxy of their parents and turned to the great Jewish secular movements of [[Zionism]], [[socialism]], and [[Bundism]] [a Jewish labor movement founded in Eastern Europe in the 19th century]. They viewed their parents' faith in the eventual coming of the Messiah as a dangerous passivity in the face of imminent danger to the Jewish people. They took their fate into their own hands and created new forms of secular Jewish messianic activity. Their concern for changing the world by rejecting their religious background shows how deeply they were immersed in the Jewish search for redemption.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Jewish Bolshevism===
A persistent theme among critics of Jews—particularly those on the pre-World War II right—has been that the [[Bolshevik]] revolution was a Jewish revolution and that the Soviet Union was dominated by Jews. This theme appears in a wide range of writings, from Henry Ford's [[The International Jew|International Jew]], to published statements by a long list of British, French, and American political figures in the 1920s (Sir [[Winston Churchill]], [[Woodrow Wilson]], and [[David Lloyd George]]), and, in its most extreme form, by [[Adolf Hitler]], who wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Now begins the last great revolution. By wresting political power for himself, the Jew casts off the few remaining shreds of disguise he still wears. The democratic plebeian Jew turns into the blood Jew and the tyrant of peoples. In a few years he will try to exterminate the national pillars of intelligence and, by robbing the peoples of their natural spiritual leadership, will make them ripe for the slavish lot of a permanent subjugation. The most terrible example of this is Russia."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Jury''' or '''juror research''' is an umbrella term for the use of research methods in an attempt to gain some understanding of the juror experience in the courtroom and how jurors individually and collectively come to a determination about the 'guilt' or otherwise of the accused.

==Brief history==
Historically, juries have played a significant role in the determination of issues that could not be managed via 'general social interactions' or ones which required punitive measures, retribution and/or compensation. The role of jurors and juries however, has changed over the centuries and have generally been moulded by social and cultural forces embedded in the wider communities in which they have evolved.&lt;ref name= "Richardson"&gt;[Richardson, C.R. (2007). [https://www120.secure.griffith.edu.au/rch/file/187be0fc-0a99-5e1c-ecb0-07f556d1777a/1/02Whole.pdf Symbolism in the Courtroom: An examination of the influence of non-verbal cues in a District Court Setting on juror ability to focus on the evidence]. VDM: Germany]&lt;/ref&gt; "Although the role of juries and jurors has a somewhat chequered history, 'the jury, in one form or the other, became the formal method of proof of the guilt or [otherwise] of a person on trial{{'"}},&lt;ref name= "Richardson" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Qld Law Reform Commission"&gt;[http://www.qlrc.qld.gov.au/reports/r35.pdf], (1985), Brisbane, Author.&lt;/ref&gt; and juries remain one of the 'cornerstones' of the criminal justice system in many countries.&lt;ref name="Findlay"&gt;[Findlay, M. (1988) The role of the jury in a fair trial. In M. Findlay &amp; P. Duff (Eds.). The jury under attack (pp. 140-160). North Ryde. Butterworths]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are however, many debates about the efficacy of the jury system and the ability of jurors to adequately determine the guilt or otherwise of the accused.  Some argue that lay individuals are incapable of digesting the often complex forensic evidence presented during a trial, others argue that any misunderstanding of the evidence is a flaw in legal cross examination and summing up. Many observe that the juror and the accused seldom can be considered 'peers' which is historically considered a fundamental precept of jury makeup. Others consider the jury system to be inherently flawed as a result of the humanity of jurors. They cite incidents in which the Judiciary have become aware of Juror assumptions made in the absence of supporting evidence, the unidentified effect on Jurors of stereotyping, culture, gender, age, education etc., which can and have influenced their ability to make a decision from an objective stance. These arguments and debates are founded in legal and psychological practice and made by social scientists and legal practitioners,&lt;ref name="Richardson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Findlay &amp; Duff"&gt;[Findlay, M. &amp; Duff, P. (Eds.). (1988) The jury under attack. North Ryde. Butterworths]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kerr"&gt;[Kerr, JF. (1987). A presumption of wisdom: An exposé of the jury system of injustice. North Ryde. Angus &amp; Robinson]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moran &amp; Comfort"&gt;[Moran, G. Comfort, JC. (1982). Scientific juror selection:Sex as a moderator of demographic and personality predictors of empanelled felony juror behaviour. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 43(5), pp.1052-1063&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reifman, Gusick &amp; Ellsworth"&gt;[ Reifman, A., Guick, S.M. &amp; Ellsworth, P.C. (1992) Real jurors' understanding of the law in real cases. Journal of Law &amp; Human Behaviour. 16 (5), pp539-554]&lt;/ref&gt;

The juror however has a very personal and different perspective.&lt;ref name="Richardson" /&gt;  The role played by the juror is an extraordinary one which is distinctive with minimal resemblance to  their 'normal daily experiences/activities'. In effect the juror is plucked from their life, sometimes for considerable periods of time, they are deposited into an environment about which they generally have little knowledge or ability to negotiate, the language and behaviours of which are foreign and they are expected to make sense of their internal and external environments.&lt;ref name="Richardson" /&gt; As a result of their jury experience many in Australia and New Zealand have reported feeling stressed, anxious, frustrated, overwhelmed and a variety of other emotions, cognitions and behaviours which to varying degrees surprised them.&lt;ref name="Richardson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deborah Wilson Consulting Services"&gt;[ (2000) Regional reports survey of Queensland Jurors, Brisbane, Author]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Young, Cameron &amp; Tinsley"&gt;[ Young, W., Cameron, N. &amp; Tinsley, Y. (1999a) Juries in criminal trials: A discussion paper. Preliminary paper 37, Volume 1. Wellington N.Z. Law Commission]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Young et al"&gt;[ Young, W., Cameron, N. &amp; Tinsley, Y. (1999b) Juries in criminal trials: A summary of research findings Preliminary paper 37, Volume 2. Wellington N.Z. Law Commission]&lt;/ref&gt;

The above factors are but a few of the many and varied variables that can impose on the juror when in the Courtroom and/or the Juryroom. Such a complex and unique experience is the jury deliberation process the outcome of which is profound and potentially lethal. Quite rightfully therefore,  the focus on jury research by legal professionals and social scientists has become, in the last 50 years or so a burgeoning area of investigation.

==Research methods==

As can be seen from the above, there are a number of reasons juries and jurors have become the target of investigation by legal practitioners and social scientists. Often overlooked is that correlation between the focus of investigation role played in the criminal justice system of the investigator or instructing organisation/individual(s) funding the research. The terms of reference, for example, for jury research performed on behalf of a trial lawyer seeking a beneficial outcome for his or her client,&lt;ref name="Courson &amp; Ausburn"&gt;[http://www.lookingglassjuries.com/images/corson-ausburn-taylor-english-article.pdf], Courson, G. &amp; Ausgurn, D., (2011), Taking the guesswork out of case assessment.&lt;/ref&gt; will most probably differ to those of a psychologist investigating the influence of say gender, demographic and personality variables on trial outcomes,&lt;ref name="Moran &amp; Comfort" /&gt; which again will most probably differ from an examination by concerned members of the Judiciary about the ability of jurors to understand the legal argument, complex forensic evidence and instructions by the legal representatives in the courtroom,.&lt;ref name="Kerr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reifman et al"&gt;[Reifman, A., Guick, S.M. &amp; Ellsworth, P.C. (1992) Real jurors' understanding of the law in real cases. Journal of Law &amp; Human Behaviour. 16 (5), pp539-554]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly methodology will differ depending on terms of reference, level of peer review, experience and ability of researchers and attitudes of funding organisations. Today, there are many companies and individuals providing services as jury consultants or trial strategists [See for example [http://juryresearchinstitute.com/services/], [http://www.magnals.com/jury_consulting.shtml] &amp; [http://www.lookingglassjuries.com/] for links to three randomly selected organisations that provide such services]. Jury consultants use market research techniques in an attempt to bolster the client's chances of a positive outcome by 'gaining an understanding of the current and environment/location specific trends that might impact the attitudes of jurors. Their job is to shape trial team strategy so as to moderate or take advantage of jurors' preexisting beliefs and experiences by way of how the evidence is presented.  Regular market research techniques are used in such instances (e.g., phone surveys, focus groups, feedback sessions etc.). Surrogate or mock jurors are selected carefully so that they are statistically representative of the 'general population in the particular  region'  and they are presented relevant information, visual exhibits, witness statements, legal cases, timelines etc. in an attempt to elicit a variety of responses, thus allowing the lawyers to prepare adequately for any possibility before it causes difficulty to their case. Jury consultants also use pre-trial techniques such as focus groups when preparing for settlement negotiations. Post-trial juror interviews sometimes allow for better understanding of mistakes or good arguments made in a trial, and that knowledge could be used for future trials or for an appeal. A recent innovation in this type of research is using electronic resources where lawyers 'pitch their submissions to online jurors'. More information about this resource can be found by following this link [http://www.lookingglassjuries.com/]. Also on these pages are papers which outline some of the perceived benefits of this type of research along with the issues which are still topics of debate.

Jury consultancy is a growing industry{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and one which uses current technologies in innovative ways{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}. However, this type of investigation makes up a relatively small proportion of Jury Research, the balance of which is generally conducted by psychologists, criminologists and other interested social scientists. As indicated above [[#Brief history|in discussions about the personal perspective of jurors]], the interaction between the juror and other jurors, the Courtroom environment, etc. is extraordinarily complex and unusual in that the behaviours and expectations of jurors performing jury duty are different from everyday experiences. The tools of the social scientist have evolved over recent decades thus allowing more variables to be considered when investigating phenomena. This is augmented by the continuous development of computer programs that can perform complex multivariate and multilevel analyses of data and models. Nonetheless, flaws inherent in social research must be considered, identified and moderated, and this is particularly relevant in Jury research.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Jury research can be done with 'real jurors' or 'mock jurors'. Each of these methods have their downfalls and each provides a different slant on the juror experience.

Access to 'real jurors' is difficult to attain, and observation of jurors whilst performing their duty is prohibited for a variety of reasons, the most prominent of which is a reluctance to allow any imposition on the jurors whilst performing their duty, which might affect the trial's result. As such access to jurors, if allowed, is generally after they have been dismissed which raises difficulties with issues such as memory distortion, overload from stress or other factors which were more pertinent to the juror while on the jury; inability to recognise the influence of demographic factors on their deliberations, etc. These are all factors or variables which are difficult to tease out of the data, but the influence of which can be adjusted in the analysis of the data if the model is theoretically  sound.

Research on mock jurors does not provide an avenue for the investigation of the 'Gestalt' of the juror experience. Mock Jurors are not 'in the midst of the experience', they are not imposed upon by the reality that the future of the person sitting before them will in some respects be influenced by them, their ability to concentrate, their attention to detail, their ability to negotiate with other jurors, and other factors which do impose on 'real jurors'.  Although mock juror research may be sufficient for examinations of the general attitudes and beliefs of a community by jury consultants{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}, when investigating the nuances of the internal processes involved in deliberating an outcome of a Court matter, mock jury research techniques fall short in terms of validity. However, again, Mock jury research has provided a significant pool of investigative pursuits and "since the 1970s as a result of considerable debate surround the issues associated with simulated research, the design and methodological parameters of simulated jury research have been made more robust.&lt;ref name="Richardson" /&gt;

'''Legal executives''' are a form of trained persons in the legal professional in certain jurisdictions. They often specialise in a particular area of [[law]]. The training that a  Legal Executive undertakes usually includes both vocational training (a minimum of 3 years for those in England and Wales) and academic qualifications.

Legal executives are associated with different membership bodies and different rights according to geographical regions. Legal executives are recognised in both [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[Singapore]],  [[Hong Kong]] and The Bahamas. There is no direct equivalent to a legal executive in [[Scotland]]. In England and Wales they hold Chartered status and are members of the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives (CILEx).

==England and Wales==
Chartered Legal Executives in England and Wales are lawyers.  They can become partners in law firms and are eligible to become judges and advocates subject to meeting eligibility requirements. As lawyers, they are subject to stringent regulation and a code of ethics as with barristers and solicitors.

Chartered Legal Executives (formerly known as Fellows of CILEx) qualify after completing their CILEX training followed by a minimum of 3 years qualifying employment. Chartered Legal Executives may do a wide range of legal work although, like solicitors, they generally specialise in one area:

* residential and commercial [[conveyancing]]
* [[will (law)|wills]] probate work and [[trusts]]
* personal injury
* family law
* criminal law
* employment law
* immigration law
* [[litigation]]
* practice management
 
After completing their academic training, trainee Legal Executives often occupy paralegal roles to satisfy the 3 year vocational stage of qualifying as Chartered Legal Executives.

===History===
The modern chartered legal executive evolved from the 19th-century managing clerk. When solicitor firms started to grow in the 19th century, they increasingly relied on an ever-expanding number of law clerks for drafting and organizing documents.  Some of these clerks in turn became knowledgeable about the law and were allowed to manage their fellow clerks; hence, they were called managing clerks.

In the 1950s and 1960s England suffered a shortage of solicitors when [[Post-World War II baby boom|population growth]] unexpectedly exceeded the number of entrants into the profession.  To improve the availability of legal services, the Law Society began aggressive recruitment efforts to convince young people to choose law as a career.  As part of this effort, the Law Society decided to turn the managing clerk into a true legal profession of its own and sponsored the ILEX's creation in 1963 as well as the change in title to legal executive. In the Law Society's own words, ILEX was intended "to stimulate recruitment to the unadmitted ranks of the professional status [...] and would offer [...] a career with proper incentives."&lt;ref&gt;Brian Abel-Smith and Robert Stevens, ''Lawyers and the Courts: A Sociological Study of the English Legal System, 1750-1965'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1967), 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute of Legal Executives was granted a royal charter to chartered professional body status in October 2011 and on 30 January 2012, officially received its charter, from the Minister of Justice, Jonathan Djanogly and was officially launched as the 'Chartered Institute of Legal Executives'.

===CILEx===
The Chartered [[Institute of Legal Executives]] (CILEx) was founded in 1892 as the Solicitors Managing Clerks' Association and became the Institute of Legal Executives, a company limited by guarantee, in 1963 with the support of the [[Law Society of England and Wales]].  In England and Wales the Institute of Legal Executives received a Royal Charter in early 2012 to become the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives (CILEx). Fully qualified members of CILEx in England and Wales are now therefore referred to as "Chartered Legal Executives".

CILEx is a professional body which represents Chartered legal executive lawyers and other legal practitioners and law staff. It has around 20,000 members.  All members of CILEx are independently regulated by ILEX Professional Standards (IPS), regardless of grade.

To qualify as a Chartered Legal Executive, aspiring Chartered Legal Executives undertake a series of training courses and are required to pass qualifications relevant to the area of practice in which they intend to specialise. The first stage for the full vocational route to qualifying is called the CILEx Level 3 Professional Diploma in Law and Practice&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cilex.org.uk/study/lawyer_qualifications/level_3_qualifications/diploma_in_law_and_practice.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; and is set at the equivalent to A-level law. The second and final qualifications are equivalent to an honours degree course - the CILEx Level 6 Diploma in Law and Practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cilex.org.uk/study/lawyer_qualifications/level_6_qualifications/level_6_diploma_law__practice.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; Trainees will often work at the same time as studying in order to acquire practical skills. The courses can be undertaken at a college, university or through an open learning programme. The courses are open to graduates and non-graduates.

A trainee must also gain 3 years' vocational experience before being admitted as a Fellow.

====Membership Grades====

=====Fellows=====
Only Fellows of CILEx (FCILEx) can lawfully hold themselves out as Chartered Legal Executives and are qualified by law (by way of CILEx) to be [[commissioner of oaths|commissioners of oaths]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cilex.org.uk/professional_issues/comm_oaths.asp]&lt;/ref&gt; able to take [[Deposition (law)|depositions]] and [[affidavits]]. Fellows also can bring action in [[court]] and appear for clients in certain courts. Appearance in courts requires a separate CILEx qualification to become a Chartered Legal Executive Advocate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cilex.org.uk/about_cilex_lawyers/cilex_advocates.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Fellows (that is, Chartered Legal Executives) are also eligible to apply and compete with barristers and solicitors for appointment to certain judicial offices, such as the position of deputy or district judge.

=====Membership levels=====
In September 2009, the CILEx training in England and Wales changed.  The CILEx qualification now emphasises and examines the practical work of the law as well as continuing with the necessary academic examinations. At the same time, a number of new membership grades were introduced by CILEx. CILEx now offers the following membership categories which can be joined according to experience and qualifications held:

*student member - for those wishing to enter the legal profession, who have no relevant legal qualification, or those with less than three years’ work experience of a predominantly legal nature. 
*affiliate member - for those with at least one CILEx level-3 unit-qualifications, or who have completed a relevant level-2 legal qualification, or gained at least three years’ work of a predominantly legal nature. 
*associate member – for those who have completed their CILEx level-3 Professional Diploma in Law and Practice (the first stage of CILEx qualifications), or who are graduates with qualifying law degrees. Associate members will be entitled to use the designatory letters ACILEx after their name and be required to undertake [[continuing professional development]] (CPD). 
*graduate member - for those who have completed both their CILEx level-3 Professional Diploma in Law and Practice and their CILEx level-6 Professional Higher Diploma in Law and Practice (including the CILEx Graduate ‘Fast-Track’ Diploma,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cilex.org.uk/study/lawyer_qualifications/graduate_fast_track_diploma.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; or who are Legal Practice Course (LPC) or Bar Vocational Course (BVC) graduates. Graduate members will be entitled to use the designatory letters GCILEx after their name and be required to undertake CPD.

Students already holding a [[Legal Practice Course]] (LPC) or [[Bar Professional Training Course]] (BPTC) qualifications are exempt from the CILEx academic qualifications and can immediately apply to become a graduate member. Graduate members must then work under the supervision of a qualified legal executive or a solicitor at a firm, either in-house at a private company or in government (provided their work is substantially of a legal rather than administrative nature). To apply to become a Fellow of the Chartered Institute they must have a minimum of three years' practical legal experience.

Once a student has successfully completed a period of qualifying employment, he or she will become a Fellow of CILEx, a qualified lawyer and will be allowed to hold themselves out as a Chartered Legal Executive and use the designatory letters FCILEx. Fellows (and other member grades) are required to maintain and improve their knowledge by undertaking CPD each year.  A proportion of those hours must relate to their area of specialism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cilex.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Fellows are issued an annual practising certificate. Only qualified and practicing Fellows of the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives may use the designatory title 'Chartered Legal Executives' which is a protected designation for practicing Fellows under its Royal Charter.

A CILEx Fellow who wishes to go on to qualify as a solicitor is usually allowed to forego the training contract aspect. For this exemption to apply, they must have attained fellowship level by the time they complete the vocational stage of solicitor training, i.e. the LPC. It goes without saying they must also have completed the academic stage; however, having come through the CILEx route to qualification, this usually means taking advanced modules of the CILEx level-6 qualification.

In The Bahamas, Legal Executives, like other members of the legal profession, are governed by and regulated in accordance with the provisions of the Legal Profession Act. The Legal Profession Act tasks the Registrar of the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas with keeping a register which is known simply as the Register of Legal Executives.

Whereas Legal Executives practising in England and Wales now enjoy certain rights of audience, in The Bahamas, Legal Executives may only appear before a particular tribunal or authority after the attorney-general has had consultations with the Bar Council of the Bahamas Bar Association.

In The Bahamas, under the Legal Profession Act, it is unlawful for a person to hold himself or herself out as a Legal Executive if their name does not appear on the Register of Legal Executives. Any person who is found to be guilty of pretending to be a Legal Executive can be liable upon conviction to a fine of B$5,000.00, or imprisonment for a period of three years, or both.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5240">'''Legal opportunity structure''' or '''legal opportunity''' is a concept found in the study of law and [[social movements]]. It was first used in order to distinguish it from [[political opportunity structure]] or [[political opportunity]], on the basis that law and the courts deserved to be studied in their own right rather than being lumped together with political institutions.&lt;ref name="HilsonChris"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Hilson | first = Chris | title = New social movements: the role of legal opportunity | journal = [[Journal of European Public Policy]] | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 238–255 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/13501760110120246 | date = January 2002 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13501760110120246 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal opportunities are made up of: access to the courts, which may be affected in particular by the law on standing or ''locus standi'', and costs rules; 'legal stock' or the set of available precedents on which to hang a case;&lt;ref name="AndersenEllen"&gt;{{cite book | last = Andersen | first = Ellen Ann | title = Out of the closets &amp; into the courts: legal opportunity structure and gay rights litigation | publisher = University of Michigan Press | location = Ann Arbor | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780472021574 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and judicial receptiveness. Some of these are more obviously structural than others - hence the term legal opportunity is sometimes preferred over legal opportunity structure.

Legal opportunity has been used as an [[independent variable]] to help to explain strategy choice by social movement organisations (SMOs) - e.g. why SMOS adopt litigation rather than protest or political lobbying as a strategy. Other variables or explanatory frameworks it is commonly found alongside include [[framing (social sciences)|framing]],&lt;ref name="VanhalaLisa"&gt;{{cite book | last = Vanhala | first = Lisa | title = Making rights a reality?: disability rights activists and legal mobilization | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781107000872 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[resource mobilization]] and grievance.

The following list compares the size of national police forces and police per head. Note that in some countries, particularly those organised under a federal system, such as the US and Canada, the total number of police officers may be much greater because sub-national governments employ significant numbers. In 2006, an analysis by the [[United Nations]] indicates an approximate median of 300 police officers per 100,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref name="unodc"&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/commissions/CCPCJ_session19/ACONF213_3eV1050608.pdf Twelfth United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, p. 19] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140211174006/http://www.unodc.org/documents/commissions/CCPCJ_session19/ACONF213_3eV1050608.pdf |date=11 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only nine countries disclosed values lower than 100 officers per 100,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref name="unodc"/&gt; The highest median of police officers – around 400 – was observed in [[West Asia]], [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Southern Europe]].&lt;ref name="unodc"/&gt; The median of police officers per population remained stable between 2002–2006, after an increase between 1995 and 2002.&lt;ref name="unodc"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="110908">An '''enacting clause''', or '''enacting formula''', is a short phrase that introduces the main provisions of a [[law]] [[Coming into force|enacted]] by a [[legislature]]. It usually declares the source from which the law claims to derive its authority. In many countries, an enacting formula is not considered necessary and is simply omitted.

The simplest enacting clauses merely cite the legislature by which the law has been adopted; for example the enacting clause used in [[Australia]] since 1990 is "The Parliament of Australia enacts".&lt;ref name="aust"/&gt; Alternatively an enacting clause may invoke the ultimate sovereign. For example, California, based on the principle of [[popular sovereignty]], has the following enacting clause: "The People of the State of California do enact as follows."{{ref|US-CA}}

===Belgium===

In Belgium the enacting formula appears in the official journal (Belgisch Staatsbald/Moniteur belgue) when the law is promulgated and published, but is usually thereafter not included when the law is printed in compilations, or stored in internet databases, even official ones. The enacting clause is as follows.

{{quote|N. (e.g. PHILIPPE), King of the Belgians: To all, present and to come, greeting. The Chambers have adopted and We sanction the following: (the articles of the law then follow. After the last article of the law the enacting formula continues). We promulgate the present law, order it to be sealed with the State Seal and published in the Moniteur belge/Belgisch Staatsbald}}
{{quote|{{lang-fr|N. (PHILIPPE), Roi des Belges, A tous, présents et à venir, Salut. Les Chambres ont adopté et Nous sanctionnons ce qui suit (...) Promulguons la présente loi, ordonnons qu’elle soit revêtue du sceau de l’Etat et publiée par le Moniteur belge.}}}}

===Brazil===
'''[[National Congress of Brazil]]''':

{{quote|"THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: I make it known that the National Congress decrees and I sanction the following Law:"}}
{{quote|{{lang-pt|"O PRESIDENTE DA REPÚBLICA: Faço saber que o Congresso Nacional decreta e eu sanciono a seguinte Lei:"'}}}}

In Brazil the presidential assent to a bill is called "sanction". After passing both Houses of Congress (the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Senate), the final version of the bill, duly signed by the presiding officers of both Houses, is sent to the President of the Republic. The document is still called a "proposed law", with a bill number, and with the header "''The National Congress decrees:''" (In Portuguese: ''"O Congresso Nacional decreta:"''). If the President approves the bill, a different copy of the act is prepared by the Presidency of the Republic, with the official number of the Law and the date of enactment of the law, and also with the replacement of the clause "The National Congress decrees:" with the above mentioned formula "''THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: I make it known that the National Congress decrees and I sanction the following Law:''". The signatures of the presiding officers of Congress are therefore not present in this version of the act. This is the version of the statute that is published in the Official Journal and that is included in the statute books. When granting his approval to a bill, the President signs both the bill sent to him by Congress and the final version of the statute with the presidential enacting formula. The signed Bill is returned to Congress by means of a presidential message; the signed statute with the presidential enacting formula is printed in the Official Journal, and the original is thereafter sent to the National Archive.
Thus, in Brazil, the President is always seen signing two different documents at bill signing ceremony (the two documents are called the "autographs"): one is the text of the proposed law, the other is the final text of the statute. Technically, the first signature (on the Bill) is the "sanction to the proposed law", that is, the approval of the bill, that transforms it in a Law, and the second signature (on the statute with the presidential enacting formula) is the promulgation, the announcement to the people that the Law has been adopted. While the signature of the President on the bill includes the addition of the formula "I sanction it" (in Portuguese: "Sanciono") above the signature, this is not seen in the final "promulgation" version of the statute. On the other hand, the promulgated statute contains not only the signature of the president, but also the countersignatures of his ministers principally charged with applying the law.

When the president vetoes a bill, and the veto is overridden, the Bill is returned by Congress to the President not for sanction (approval), but merely for promulgation. In that case, the president is expected to promulgate the bill in 48 hours. In that situation, the enacting formula that appears in the final text of the adopted statute is as follows:

{{quote|"THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: I make it known that the National Congress maintained and I promulgate the following Law:"}}
{{quote|{{lang-pt|"O PRESIDENTE DA REPÚBLICA: Faço saber que o Congresso Nacional manteve e eu promulgo a seguinte Lei:"}}}}

Tacit sanction (i.e. implicit approval) is deemed to take place if the president fails to sign or veto a bill within the constitutionally mandated timeframe of fifteen working days from receiving the bill. Once the bill is considered implicitlly sanctioned, the president is expected to promulgate the new law and the same 48-hour timeframe applies. The formula in this case is:

{{quote|"THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: I make it known that the National Congress decrees and I promulgate the following Law:"}}
{{quote|{{lang-pt|"O PRESIDENTE DA REPÚBLICA: Faço saber que o Congresso Nacional decreta e eu promulgo a seguinte Lei:"}}}}

Should the president refuse to promulgate, or fail to promulgate in the period of 48 hours, a bill, after his veto has been overridden by Congress, then the authority to promulgate the bill passes to the President of the Senate. In that case, the formula of promulgation is:

{{quote|"The President of the FEDERAL SENATE promulgates, in accordance with art. 66 §7, of the Federal Constitution, the following Law, that results from bill vetoed by the President of the Republic and maintained by the National Congress:"}}
{{quote|{{lang-pt|"O Presidente do SENADO FEDERAL promulga, nos termos do art. 66, § 7, da Constituição Federal, a seguinte Lei, resultante de Projeto vetado pelo Presidente da República e mantido pelo Congresso Nacional:"}}}}

Should the president of the Republic refuse to promulgate, or fail to promulgate in the period of 48 hours, a bill, after the bill has been implicitly sanctioned due to his failure to sign or veto it within the constitutionally mandated timeframe, then the authority to promulgate the bill passes to the President of the Senate. In that case, the formula of promulgation is:

{{quote|"I make it known that the NATIONAL CONGRESS enacted, the President of the Republic, in accordance with the provisions of §3 of the art. 66 of the Constitution, sanctioned, and I, (NAME IN CAPITAL LETTERS), President of the Federal Senate, in accordance with the §7 of the same article, do promulgate the following Law:"}}
{{quote|{{lang-pt|"Faço saber que o CONGRESSO NACIONAL aprovou, o Presidente da República, nos termos do § 3o do art. 66 da Constituição, sancionou, e eu, (NAME IN CAPITAL LETTERS), Presidente do Senado Federal, nos termos do § 7o do mesmo artigo promulgo a seguinte Lei:"}}}}

Whenever the president adopts a provisional measure and the provisional measure is approved by Congress with changes, a normal bill is sent to the president for approval or veto, and the same formulas used for other bills are employed; once enacted, the new statute replaces the provisional measure. However, if the provisional measure adopted by the president is approved by Congress without changes, the bill does not need to be presented for approval or veto; in that case, the law that both corresponds fully to the provisional measure and replaces it is promulgated directly by the President of the Senate, with the following words:

{{quote|"I make it known that the President of the Republic adopted the Provisional Measure number NNN of YYYY, that the National Congress approved, and I, (NAME IN CAPITAL LETTERS), President of the Federal Senate, for the effects of the provision of the sole paragraph of art. 62 of the Federal Constitution, do promulgate the following Law:"}}
{{quote|{{lang-pt|"Faço saber que o Presidente da República adotou a Medida Provisória no NN, de YYYY, que o Congresso Nacional aprovou e eu, (NAME IN CAPITAL LETTERS), Presidente do Senado Federal, para os efeitos do disposto no parágrafo único do art. 62 da Constituição Federal, promulgo a seguinte Lei:"}}}}

'''General Assembly of the Empire of Brazil''' (1822-1889)

Whenever the General Assembly of the Empire (made up of a Senate and of a Chamber of Deputies) passed a bill, a decree of the General Assembly containing the articles of the approved bill was sent to the Emperor for sanction or veto. The Decree of the General Assembly began with the following formula (that did not appear in the final version of the statute, after the imperial sanction): "''The General Assembly decrees:''" (in Portuguese: "''A Assembleia Geral decreta:''"). The decree was still only a proposed law, that would become an actual law if sanctioned by the Emperor. The General Assembly sent its decree to the Emperor for sanction or veto by means of a message with the words following: "''The General Assembly sends to the Emperor the enclosed decree, that it considers advantageous, and useful to the Empire, and it asks that His Imperial Majesty may be pleased to grant it His sanction''" (in Portuguese: "''A Assembleia Geral dirige ao Imperador o decreto incluso, que julga vantajoso e útil ao Império, e pede a Sua Majestade Imperial, se digne dar a Sua sanção"''). If the Emperor decided to sanction the decree, then he sent the message of the General Assembly back to the Legislature, adding after the text of the Decree of the General Assembly the following words, together with the date and his signature: ""''The Emperor consents''" (in Portuguese: "''O Imperador consente''"). Then, the Executive branch prepared a formal document to promulgate the new law, and this document was known in the imperial period as a ''Charter of Law'' (in Portuguese: ''Carta de Lei''). It was the chartered version of the law that was included in the statute books and that was printed and published for the knowledge of the people. Thus, the Charter of Law was the final version of the statute as adopted. It was signed by the Emperor and countersigned by his responsible Ministers, and contained an enacting formula as follows:

{{quote|NAME OF THE EMPEROR PRECEDED BY THE TITLE "DOM" (e.g. "DOM PETER THE SECOND"), by the grace of God and unanimous acclamation of the peoples, Constitutional Emperor and Perpetual Defender of Brazil: We make it known to all Our subjects that the General Assembly has decreed and We will the following law: 
(the provisions of the Law then followed, and after the last article of the Law the text of the statute finished with a continuation of the enacting formula, as follows). 
We command, therefore, all the authorities whom the knowledge and execution of this present Law may concern, that they comply with it and that they make it be complied with and kept, as faithfully and as fully as provided herein. The Secretary of State of the Affairs of... (title of the responsible Minister of the Crown who countersigns the Act with the Emperor and who heads the Department principally charged with applying the Law) is to make this Law be printed, published and circulated. Given at the Palace of... on (day) of (month) of (year), in the (year) of the Independence and of the Empire.}}

{{quote|{{lang-pt|NAME OF THE EMPEROR PRECEDED BY THE TITLE "DOM" (e.g. "DOM PEDRO SEGUNDO"), por graça de Deus e unânime aclamação dos povos, Imperador Constitucional e Defensor Perpétuo do Brasil: Fazemos saber a todos os Nossos súditos que a Assembleia Geral decretou e Nós queremos a seguinte lei:
(the provisions of the Law then followed, and after the last article of the Law the text of the statute finished with a continuation of the enacting formula, as follows)

Dada no palácio... no (day) de (month) de (year), no (year) da Independência e do Império.}}}}

When the powers of the Emperor were discharged by Regents on behalf of the monarch the formula was as follows:

{{quote|The Regency (or "The Regent"; or "The Princess Imperial Regent"), in the Name of His Majesty the Emperor, the Lord (name of the Emperor preceded by the title "Dom", e.g., "Dom Pedro II"), makes it known to all the subjects of the Empire that the General Assembly has decreed and it (or "He" or "She") sanctioned the following law:

(He, She, It) commands, therefore, all the authorities whom the knowledge and execution of this present Law may concern, that they comply with it and that they make it be complied with and kept, as faithfully and as fully as provided herein.

'''The National Institute for Trial Advocacy''' (referred to as "NITA") is a not for profit organization that was initially formed in 1969 in an effort to provide lawyers with better trial skills training, and was spurred on by criticisms within the judicial system of the apparent lack of trial preparation occurring within law schools. This initial group of law professors and lawyers worked with the intention of addressing this problem and came to the conclusion that [[Experiential learning|learning-by-doing]] trial training was the best approach. This group spent two more years improving their trial material and in 1972 NITA's inaugural National Session was held at the University of Colorado in Boulder. This program brings together participants from all across the country who are taught through a learning by doing approach how to better represent their clients in the courtroom. The national session has been held every year since 1972&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nita.org/page.asp?id=7&amp;catid=32&amp;prodid=362 NITA Web Site | Building Trial Skills: National Session&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and NITA has since expanded its scope, holding public service trial training sessions in a variety of specialties across the country as well as other skills courses including deposition and courtroom technology skills.

{{legal status}}
'''Naturalization''' (or '''naturalisation''') is the legal act or process by which a non-citizen in a country may acquire [[citizenship]] or [[nationality]] of that country. It may be done by a statute, without any effort on the part of the individual, or it may involve an application and approval by legal authorities. The rules of naturalization vary from country to country and typically include a minimum legal [[Permanent residency|residency]] requirement, and may specify other requirements such as knowledge of the national dominant language or culture, a promise to obey and uphold that country's laws. An oath or pledge of allegiance is also sometimes required. Some countries also require that the person renounce any other citizenship that they currently hold, forbidding [[Multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]], but whether this renunciation actually causes [[loss of citizenship|loss of the person's original citizenship]], as seen by the host country and by the original country, will again depend on the laws of the countries involved.

The massive increase in population flux due to [[globalization]] and the sharp increase in the numbers of [[refugee]]s following World War I created a large number of  [[stateless person]]s, people who were not citizens of any state. In some rare cases, laws for mass naturalization were passed. As naturalization laws had been designed to cater for the relatively few people who had voluntarily moved from one country to another (expatriates), many western democracies were not ready to naturalize large numbers of people. This included the massive influx of stateless people which followed massive denationalizations and the expulsion of [[ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]] from newly created [[nation states]] in the first part of the 20th century, but they also included the mostly [[aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] [[History of Russia|Russians]] who had escaped the 1917 [[October Revolution]] and the [[war communism]] period, and then the [[Spanish Civil War|Spanish refugees]]. As [[Hannah Arendt]] pointed out, [[internment camps]] became the "only nation" of such stateless people, since they were often considered "undesirable" and were stuck in an illegal situation, wherein their country had expelled them or deprived them of their nationality, while they had not been naturalized, thus living in a judicial [[no man's land]].

Since [[World War II]], the increase in [[Human migration|international migrations]] created a new category of refugees, most of them [[Foreign worker|economic refugees]]. For economic, political, humanitarian and pragmatic reasons, many states passed laws allowing a person to acquire their citizenship after birth, such as by marriage to a national – ''[[jus matrimonii]]'' – or by having ancestors who are nationals of that country, in order to reduce the scope of this category. However, in some countries this system still maintains a large part of the immigrated population in an illegal status, albeit with some massive regularizations, for example, in Spain by [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero|José Luis Zapatero]]'s government and in Italy by [[Silvio Berlusconi|Berlusconi]]'s government.

== Laws by country ==
==={{flag|China}}===
{{Main|Nationality law of the People's Republic of China}}

The [[China|People's Republic of China]] gives citizenship to persons with one or two parents with Chinese nationality who have not taken residence in other countries. The country also gives citizenship to people born on its territory to [[statelessness|stateless people]] who have settled there. Furthermore, individuals may apply for nationality if they have a near relative with Chinese nationality, if they have settled in China, or if they present another legitimate reason.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.hk/en/residents/immigration/chinese/law.htm Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China], GovHK.hk&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, only few people gain Chinese citizenship; as of 2010, China had only 1,448 naturalised Chinese in total.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21710264-worlds-rising-superpower-has-particular-vision-ethnicity-and-nationhood-has Who is Chinese? The upper Han], ''[[The Economist]]'', 19 November 2016 (page visited on 19 November 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

The naturalization process starts with a written application. Applicants must submit three copies, written with a ball-point or fountain pen, to national authorities, and to provincial authorities in the Ministry of Public Security and the Public Security Bureau. Applicants must also submit original copies of a foreign passport, a residence permit, a permanent residence permit, and four two-and-a-half inch long pictures. According to the conditions outlined in the [[Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China]], authorities may also require "any other material that the authority believes are related to the nationality application".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enghengyang.gov.cn/showdetail.aspx?typeid=&amp;newsid=1394 "Guide and Instructions of Naturalization of Chinese Nationality"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522164847/http://www.enghengyang.gov.cn/showdetail.aspx?typeid=&amp;newsid=1394 |date=2012-05-22 }}, Hengyang, China website&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Indian nationality law}}
The [[India]]n citizenship and nationality law and the [[Constitution of India]] provides single citizenship for the entire country. The provisions relating to citizenship at the commencement of the Constitution are contained in [https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/India_2014#50 Articles 5 to 11] in Part&amp;nbsp;II of the Constitution of India. Relevant [[India]]n legislation is the Citizenship Act 1955, which has been amended by the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 1986, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 1992, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060425230738/http://rajyasabha.nic.in/legislative/amendbills/XXXIX_2003.pdf Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2003], and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110514150614/http://www.manupatra.com/downloads/2005-data/Citizenship%20Amendment%20Ordinance%202005/Citizenship%20Amendment%20Ordinance%202005.htm Citizenship (Amendment) Ordinance 2005]. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2003 received the assent of the President of India on 7 January 2004 and came into force on 3 December 2004. The Citizenship (Amendment) Ordinance 2005 was promulgated by the President of India and came into force on 28 June 2005.

Following these reforms, Indian nationality law largely follows the ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' (citizenship by right of blood) as opposed to the ''[[jus soli]]'' (citizenship by right of birth within the territory).

==={{flag|Indonesia}}===
{{Main|Indonesian nationality law}}
[[Indonesia]]n nationality is regulated by Law No. 12/2006 (UU No. 12 Tahun 2006). The Indonesian nationality law is based on [[jus sanguinis]] and [[jus soli]]. The Indonesian nationality law does not recognize [[dual citizenship]] except for persons under the age of 18 (single citizenship principle). After reaching 18 years of age individuals are forced to choose one citizenship (limited double citizenship principle).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Indonesia's New Immigration Law Confuses One and All|publisher= [[Jakarta Globe]]|date= |url= http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/new-immigration-law-confuses-one-and-all/472829|accessdate= 2012-06-15|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120603061637/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/new-immigration-law-confuses-one-and-all/472829|archive-date= 2012-06-03|dead-url= yes|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A foreign citizen can apply to become an Indonesian citizen with the following requirements:
* Age 18 or older, or married
* Resided in Indonesia for a minimum of 5 consecutive years or 10 non-consecutive years
* Physically and mentally healthy
* Ability to speak [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] and acknowledge [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] and [[Constitution of Indonesia|Undang-Undang Dasar Negara Republik Indonesia Tahun 1945]]
* Never convicted of a crime for which the punishment is imprisonment for one year or more
* If having Indonesian citizenship will not give the person dual citizenship
* Employed or have fixed income
* Pay citizenship fee

Any application for citizenship is granted by the [[President of Indonesia]].

==={{flag|Israel}}===
[[Israel]]'s [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] was made on 14 May 1948, the day before the British Mandate was due to expire as a result of the United Nations Partition Plan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0514.html "Zionists Proclaim New State of Israel; Truman Recognizes it and Hopes for Peace"], ''[[New York Times]]'', 15 May 1948&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli parliament created two laws regarding immigration, citizenship and naturalization: the [[Law of Return]] and the [[Israeli nationality law]].&lt;ref name ="Warsoff"&gt;Warsoff, Louis A. "Citizenship in the State of Israel – a Comment", ''New York University Law Review'' 33(1958): 857–862. Web. 28 Nov. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Law of Return, enacted on July 15, 1950, gives [[Jews]] living anywhere in the world the right to immigrate to Israel. This right to immigrate did not and still does not grant citizenship. In fact, for four years after Israel gained independence, there were no Israeli citizens.&lt;ref name ="Warsoff" /&gt;

On July 14, 1952, the Israeli parliament enacted the Israeli Nationality Law.&lt;ref name ="Warsoff" /&gt; The Nationality Law naturalized all citizens of Mandated Palestine, the inhabitants of Israel on July 15, 1952, and those who had legally resided in Israel between May 14, 1948, and July 14, 1952. The law further clarified that naturalization was available to immigrants who had arrived before Israel's creation, immigrants who arrived after statehood was granted, and those who did not come to Israel as immigrants but have since expressed desire to settle in Israel, with restriction. Naturalization applicants must also meet the following requirements: be over 18 years of age, have resided in Israel for three out of the five preceding years, have settled or intend to settle permanently in Israel, have some knowledge of Hebrew, and have renounced prior nationality or demonstrated ability to renounce nationality after becoming a citizen of Israel.&lt;ref name ="Warsoff" /&gt;

Because of Israel's relatively new and culturally mixed identity, Israel does not grant citizenship to persons born on Israeli soil. Instead, the government chose to enact a jus sanguinis system, with the naturalization restrictions listed above. There is currently no legislation on second-generation immigrants (those born in Israel to immigrant parents). Furthermore, foreign spouses can apply for citizenship through the Minister of the Interior, but have a variety of restrictions and are not guaranteed citizenship.&lt;ref name ="Weil"&gt;Weil, Patrick.

==={{flag|Russia}}===
Naturalization in [[Russia]] is guided by articles 13 and 14 of the federal law “About Citizenship of Russian Federation” passed on May 31, 2002. Citizenship of Russia can be obtained in general or simplified order. To become a citizen in general order, one must be 18 years of age or older, continuously live in Russia as a permanent resident for at least five years (this term is limited to one year for valued specialists, political asylum seekers and refugees), have legal means of existence, promise to obey the laws and [[Constitution of Russia]] and be fluent in the [[Russian language]].

There is also a possibility to naturalize in a simplified order, in which certain requirements will be waived. Eligible for that are persons, at least one parent of whom is a Russian citizen living on Russian territory; persons, who lived on the territories of the former [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]] but never obtained citizenships of those nations after they gained independence; persons, who were born on the territory of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|RSFSR]] and formerly held [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] citizenship; persons married to Russian citizens for at least 3 years; persons, who served in [[Russian Armed Forces]] under contract for at least 3 years; parents of mentally incapacitated children over 18 who are Russian citizens; participants of the State Program for Assisting Compatriots Residing Abroad; and some other categories.&lt;ref name="Russia"&gt;[http://archive.mid.ru//dks.nsf/mnsdoc/04.03.02.02 About Citizenship of Russian Federation], 31 May 2002 N 62-ФЗ&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{flag|South Africa}}===
Chapter 2 of the South African Citizenship Act, enacted on October 6, 1995, defines who is considered a naturalized citizen at the time of the act and also outlines the naturalization process for future immigrants.&lt;ref name="South"&gt;South African Citizenship Act. Pub. L. 1547. 6 Oct. 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Any person who immediately prior to the commencement of the act had been a South African citizen via naturalization, had been deemed to be a South African citizen by registration, or had been a citizen via naturalization of any of the former states now composing South Africa is now considered to be a naturalized citizen of South Africa.&lt;ref name ="South" /&gt;

Those wishing to apply for naturalization in the future must apply to the Minister of Home Affairs and must meet a slew of requirements. First, naturalization applicants must be over the age of 18 and must have been a permanent resident of South Africa for one year prior to application and for four out of the eight years prior to application. Applicants must also demonstrate good character and knowledge of the basic responsibilities and privileges of a South African citizen. The ability to communicate in one of the official languages of South Africa is also required. Applicants must show the intention to reside in South Africa after naturalization, and they are required to make a declaration of allegiance.&lt;ref name ="South" /&gt;According to [https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/South_Africa_2012#30 Article 3], subsection 3 of the South African constitution, national legislation must provide for the acquisition, loss and restoration of citizenship. 

Being a naturalized South African citizen is a privilege, not a right. Even after meeting all the requirements and going through the naturalization process, the minister holds the right to deny citizenship.&lt;ref name ="Minister"&gt;"South African Citizenship Through Naturalization." Immigration Assistant. N.p., 21 July 2009. Web. 1 Dec. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign spouses of South African citizens can apply for naturalization after two years of marriage, but is subject to potential denial of the minister. The minister can also grant citizenship to minors, if their parent applies for them.&lt;ref name ="South" /&gt;

The minister also holds the power to revoke naturalization at any time for specific reasons listed in the Act. Reasons for revoking the naturalization certificate include marrying someone who is a citizen of another country and holding citizenship in another country, or applying for citizenship of another country without prior authorization for retention of citizenship.&lt;ref name ="Minister" /&gt; If a permanent resident is denied naturalization, he or she must wait at least one year before reapplying.&lt;ref name ="South" /&gt;

==={{flag|United Kingdom}}===
{{Main|British nationality law}}
There has always been a distinction in the [[law of England and Wales]] between the subjects of the monarch and aliens: the monarch's subjects owed the monarch allegiance, and included those born in his or her dominions (natural-born subjects) and those who later gave him or her their allegiance (naturalised subjects). Today, the requirements for naturalisation as a citizen of the [[United Kingdom]] depend on whether or not one is the spouse or [[Civil partnership in the United Kingdom|civil partner]] of a citizen. An applicant who is a spouse or civil partner of a British citizen must:
* hold [[indefinite leave to remain]] in the [[UK]] (or an equivalent such as [[Right of Abode (United Kingdom)|Right of Abode]] or Irish citizenship)
* have lived legally in the UK for three years
* been outside of the UK no more than 90 days during the one-year period prior to filing the application.
* show sufficient knowledge of life in the UK, either by passing the [[Life in the United Kingdom test]] or by attending combined English language and citizenship classes. Proof of this must be supplied with one's application for naturalisation. Those aged 65 or over may be able to claim exemption.
* meet specified [[English language|English]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]] or [[Scottish Gaelic language]] competence standards.  Those who pass the ''Life in the UK test'' are deemed to meet English language requirements.

For those not married to or in a civil partnership with a British citizen, the requirements are:
* Five years legal residence in the UK
* Indefinite leave to remain or "equivalent" for this purpose (see above) must have been held for 12&amp;nbsp;months
* the applicant must intend to continue to live in the UK or work overseas for the UK government or a British corporation or association
* the same "good character" standards apply as for those married to British citizens
* the same language and knowledge of life in the UK standards apply as for those married to British citizens.

{{See also|History of laws concerning immigration and naturalization in the United States}}
[[File:Naturalization ceremony at Kennedy Space Center.jpg|thumb|New citizens at a naturalization ceremony at [[Kennedy Space Center]] in 2010]]

In the [[United States|United States of America]], the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] gives Congress the power to prescribe a uniform rule of naturalization, which is administered by state courts. There was some confusion about which courts could naturalize; the final ruling was that it could be done by any "court of record having common-law jurisdiction and a clerk ([[prothonotary]]) and seal."

The Constitution also mentions "[[Natural-born citizen|natural born citizen]]". The first naturalization Act (drafted by Thomas Jefferson) used the phrases "natural born" and "native born" interchangeably.

The Constitution does not mandate race-neutral naturalization, and the First Congress passed a naturalization act that limited eligibility for naturalization to “free white persons.” Shortly after the Civil War, Congress also extended racial eligibility for naturalization to “aliens of African nativity and persons of African descent.” Racial eligibility for naturalization was limited to these racial categories until 1940, after which eligibility for naturalization was also extended to “descendants of races indigenous to the Western Hemisphere,” “Filipino persons or persons of Filipino descent,” “Chinese persons or persons of Chinese descent,” and “persons of races indigenous to India.” The racial eligibility provisions were removed from the naturalization act in 1952, but while they remained in place many federal and state courts as well as the United States Board of Immigration Appeals interpreted the phrase “free white person” in a variety of cases involving the contested naturalization applications of immigrants from Asia and the Pacific Rim who some claimed were racially ineligible for naturalization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunypress.edu/p-6435-race-nation-and-refuge.aspx Doug Coulson, ''Race, Nation, and Refuge: The Rhetoric of Race in Asian American Citizenship Cases'' (Albany: SUNY Press, 2017).]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Naturalization is also mentioned in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. The Supreme Court, in the case of ''[[Minor v. Happersett]]'' explained who the citizens of the United States were before its adoption, the Court said, Before the 14th Amendment, "the Constitution of the United States did not in terms prescribe who should be citizens [of the United States] or of the several states, yet there were necessarily such citizens without such provision. Additions might always be made to the citizenship of the United States in two ways: first, by birth, and second, by naturalization". Before the U.S. Constitution was adopted, individual states set their own standards for citizenship; After adoption, all state citizens "became ipso facto a citizen" of the United States and all children born in the United States "of parents who were its citizens became themselves, upon their birth, citizens [of the United States]. These were natives or natural-born citizens, as distinguished from aliens or foreigners.". The 14th Amendment states that "all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof shall be citizens of the United States and of the State in which they reside". The ''Minor v. Happersett'' Court went on to say, "Some authorities go further and include as citizens children born within the jurisdiction without reference to the citizenship of their parents. As to this class there have been doubts, but never as to the first". The Supreme Court later, in the case of ''[[Afroyim v. Rusk]]'', interpreted this clause to imply that a naturalized citizen cannot be subsequently deprived of U.S. citizenship involuntarily.

[[File:US Navy 090528-N-3207B-034 Sailors, Marines, Soldiers and Airmen recite the pledge of allegiance during a naturalization ceremony at the USS Midway Museum.jpg|thumb|upright|Service members are sworn in as citizens aboard the [[USS Midway (CV-41)|USS ''Midway'']] in 2009]]

The [[Naturalization Act of 1795]] set the initial rules on naturalization: "free, White persons" who had been resident for five years or more. The [[Naturalization Act of 1798]], part of the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]], was passed by the [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] and extended the residency requirement from five to fourteen years. It specifically targeted [[Irish ethnicity|Irish]] and [[France|French]] immigrants who were involved in [[Democratic-Republican Party]] politics. It was repealed in 1802.

An 1862 law allowed honorably discharged Army veterans of any war to petition for naturalization, without having filed a declaration of intent, after only one year of residence in the United States. An 1894 law extended the same privilege to honorably discharged five-year veterans of the Navy or Marine Corps. Over 192,000 aliens were naturalized between May 9, 1918, and June 30, 1919, under an act of May 9, 1918. Laws enacted in 1919, 1926, 1940, and 1952 continued preferential treatment provisions for veterans.&lt;ref&gt;Schulze, Lorine McGinnis (2003). [http://www.naturalizationrecords.com/usa/ Naturalization Records in the USA"], Retrieved April 23, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Passage of the Fourteenth Amendment meant that, in theory, all persons born in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens regardless of race. Citizenship by birth in the United States, however, was not initially granted to [[Asians]] until 1898, when the Supreme Court, in the case of ''[[United States v. Wong Kim Ark]]'' held that the Fourteenth Amendment did apply to Asians born in the United States to Alien parents who have a permanent domicile and residence in the United States.

The enabling legislation for the naturalization aspects of the Fourteenth Amendment was the [[Naturalization Act of 1870]], which allowed naturalization of "aliens of [[Africa]]n nativity and to persons of African descent", but is silent about other races. The 1882 [[Chinese Exclusion Act (United States)|Chinese Exclusion Act]] banned Chinese workers and specifically barred them from naturalization. The [[Immigration Act of 1917]], (Barred Zone Act) extended those restrictions to almost all Asians.

The 1922 [[Cable Act]] specified that women marrying aliens ineligible for naturalization lose their US citizenship. At the time, all Asians were ineligible for naturalization. The [[Immigration Act of 1924]] barred entry of all those ineligible for naturalization, which again meant non-Filipino Asians.

Following the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898, [[Philippines|Philippine]] residents were classified as U.S. nationals, and the 1917 [[Jones–Shafroth Act]] granted U.S. citizenship to citizens of [[Puerto Rico]]. But the 1934 [[Tydings–McDuffie Act]] (or Philippine Independence Act) reclassified Filipinos as aliens, and set a quota of 50 immigrants per year, and otherwise applying the Immigration Act of 1924 to them. The quotas did not apply to Filipinos who served in the [[United States Navy]], which actively recruited in the Philippines at that time.

Chinese persons were first permitted naturalization by the 1943 [[Magnuson Act]], which repealed the Chinese Exclusion Act. [[India]] and the Philippines were allowed 100 annual immigrants under the 1946 [[Filipino Naturalization Act]]. The [[War Brides Act]] of 1945 permitted soldiers to bring back their foreign wives and established precedent in naturalization through [[marriage]]. The 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act (better known as the [[McCarran–Walter Act]]) lifted racial restrictions, but kept the quotas in place. The [[Immigration Act of 1965]] finally allowed Asians and all persons from all nations be given equal access to immigration and naturalization.

[[Illegal immigration]] became a major issue in the United States at the end of the 20th century. The [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986]], while tightening border controls, also provided the opportunity of naturalization for illegal aliens who had been in the country for at least four years. Today, lawful permanent resident aliens can apply for naturalization in the  United States after five years, unless they continue to be married to a U.S. citizen, in which case they can apply after three years of permanent residency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.immigrationamerica.org/citizenship/naturalization "Citizenship Through Naturalization"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824103202/http://www.immigrationamerica.org/citizenship/naturalization |date=2011-08-24 }}, ImmigrationAmerica&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Child Citizenship Act of 2000]] streamlined the naturalization process for children [[adoption in the United States|adopted]] [[international adoption|internationally]]. A child under age 18 who is adopted by at least one U.S. citizen parent, and is in the custody of the citizen parent(s), is now automatically naturalized once admitted to the United States as an immigrant or when legally adopted in the United States, depending on the visa under which the child was admitted to the United States. The Act also provides that the non-citizen minor child of a newly naturalized U.S. citizen, whether by birth or adoption, also automatically receives U.S. citizenship

== Mass naturalizations ==
A few rare mass naturalization processes have been implemented by nation states. In 1891, Brazil granted naturalization to all aliens living in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituiçao91.htm Constituição Da República Dos EstadosUnidos Do Brasil (De 24 De Fevereiro De 1891)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130804130509/http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constitui%C3%A7ao91.htm |date=2013-08-04 }}, Presidência da República – Casa Civil, art. 69&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, [[History of Greece|Greece]] massively naturalized all the Greek refugees coming back from [[History of the Republic of Turkey|Turkey]]. The second massive naturalization process was in favor of Armenian refugees coming from Turkey, who went to [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]] or other former [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman countries]]. Reciprocally, Turkey massively naturalized the refugees of Turkish descent or other ethnic backgrounds in Muslim creed from these countries during a redemption process.

[[Canada]] instituted a mass naturalization by [[Act of Parliament]] with the enactment of the [[Canadian Citizenship Act 1946]].

After [[annexation]] of the territories east of the [[Curzon line]] by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1945, Soviets naturalized ''en masse'' all the inhabitants of those territories—including ethnic [[Poles]], as well as its other citizens who had been deported into the Soviet Union, mainly to [[Kazakhstan]]. Those persons were forcibly naturalized as Soviet citizens.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Later on, [[Germany]] granted to the ethnic [[Germans|German]] population in [[Russia]] and Kazakhstan full citizenship rights. Poland has a limited [[repatriation]] program in place.

The most recent massive naturalization case resulted from the [[Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002)|Argentine economic crisis]] in the beginning of the 21st century. Existing or slightly updated [[right of return]] laws in [[Spain]] and [[Italy]] allowed many of their [[diaspora|diasporic]] descendants to obtain—in many cases to regain—naturalization in virtue of ''[[jus sanguinis]]'', as in the Greek case. Hence, many Argentines acquired European nationality.

Since the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] grants citizenship only to those "born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof", and the original [[United States Constitution]] only grants Congress the power of naturalization, it could be argued that all acts of Congress that expand the right of citizenship are cases of mass naturalization.  This includes the acts that extended U.S. citizenship to citizens of [[Puerto Rico]], the [[United States Virgin Islands]], [[Guam]], and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], as well as the [[Indian Citizenship Act of 1924]] which made all [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] citizens (most of them were previously excluded under the "jurisdiction" clause of the 14th Amendment).

In the eastern Malaysian state of [[Sabah]], mass naturalisation also happened during the administration of [[United Sabah National Organisation]] (USNO) and [[Sabah People's United Front]] (BERJAYA's) Muslim-dominated political parties to increase the Muslim population in the territory by naturalising immigrants and refugees from the mainly-Muslim dominated areas of [[Mindanao]] and [[Sulu Archipelago]] of the Philippines and [[Sulawesi]] of Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kamal Sadiq|title=Paper Citizens: How Illegal Immigrants Acquire Citizenship in Developing Countries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xDa6LrF1yCIC&amp;pg=PA49|date=2 December 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-970780-5|pages=49–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ww2.sabah.gov.my/lbk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=79&amp;Itemid=538|title='Mustapha Bertanggungjawab Ubah Demografi Sabah'|author=Nigel|language=Malay|work=Sabah State Government|publisher=Kudat Town Board|date=16 August 2013|accessdate=1 June 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601030334/http://ww2.sabah.gov.my/lbk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=79&amp;Itemid=538 |archivedate=1 June 2016|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.usm.my/km/33(2)2015/km33022015_01.pdf |title=Patronage, Power and Prowess: Barisan Nasional's Equilibrium Dominance in East Malaysia |author=Faisal H.

=== In occupied territories ===
The mass naturalization of native persons in occupied territories is illegal under the laws of war (Hague and Geneva Conventions).  However, there have been many instances of such illegal mass naturalizations in the 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

{{main|Loss of citizenship}}
'''Denaturalization''' is the reverse of naturalization, when a state deprives one of its citizens of his or her [[citizenship]]. From the point of view of the individual, denaturalization means [[revocation]] or [[loss of citizenship]]. Denaturalization can be based on various legal justifications. The most severe form is the "stripping of citizenship" when denaturalization takes place as a penalty for actions considered criminal by the state, often only indirectly related to nationality, for instance for having served in a foreign military. In countries that enforce [[multiple citizenship|single citizenship]], voluntary naturalization in another country will lead to an automatic loss of the original citizenship; the language of the law often refers to such cases as "giving up one's citizenship" or (implicit) [[renunciation of citizenship]]. In another case, affecting only foreign-born citizens, denaturalization can refer to the loss of citizenship by an [[annulment]] of naturalization, also known as "administrative denaturalization" where the original act of naturalization is found to be invalid, for instance due to an [[Administrative Error|administrative error]] or if it had been based on [[fraud]] (including [[bribery]]). In the US, the [[Bancroft Treaties]] in the 19th century regulated legislation concerning denaturalization.

In 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Mark Rockwell|url=https://fcw.com/articles/2018/01/12/janus-dhs-biometrics.aspx|title=DHS pursues cases exploiting biometric data gaps|website=fcw.com|date=2018-01-12|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; the U.S. government launched a program (''Operation Janus'') “to prevent aliens who received a final removal order under a different identity from obtaining immigration benefits”.&lt;ref name="snopes-2018-07-12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/denaturalization-task-force/|title=Has the Trump Administration Launched an Immigrant ‘Denaturalization’ Task Force|website=snopes.com|date=2018-07-12|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, for the first time, a denaturalization was performed as a result of this program,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Jeff Mordock|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jan/9/first-denaturalization-occurs-under-dojs-operation/|title=For first time, Justice Dept. yanks naturalized citizenship in new 'Operation Janus' crackdown|publisher=Washington Times|date=2018-01-09|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a further program (''Operation Second Look'') was initiated by the [[Homeland Security Investigations|HSI]] specifically to address leads received from Operation Janus. In June 2018, UCSIS announced an increase of the efforts to detect fraudulent naturalization cases, aiming at the revocation of the citizenship of individuals who had applied under false pretense.&lt;ref name="snopes-2018-07-12"/&gt;

=== After World War II ===
==== In the United States ====
{{see also|List of denaturalized former citizens of the United States}}
Loss of U.S. citizenship was a consequence of foreign military service based on Section 349(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act until its provisions were found unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[https://travel.state.gov/law/citizenship/citizenship_780.html "Advice about Possible Loss of U.S. Citizenship and Foreign Military Service"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202070748/http://www.travel.state.gov/law/citizenship/citizenship_780.html |date=2011-02-02 }}, Travel.State.Gov&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/15032.html|title=The Sovereign Citizen {{!}} Patrick Weil|website=www.upenn.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yaser Esam Hamdi]] was a U.S. citizen captured in Afghanistan in 2001. He was fighting against U.S. and [[Afghan Northern Alliance]] forces, siding with the [[Taliban]]. He was named by the Bush administration as an [[illegal enemy combatant]], and militarily detained in the country for almost three years without receiving any charges. On September 23, 2004, the [[U.S. Justice Department]] agreed to release Hamdi to Saudi Arabia on the condition that he give up his U.S. citizenship, though since it was done under duress it is possible that he can later reclaim it.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}&lt;!-- it "may" be possible? --&gt;

==== In the United Kingdom ====
Section 4 of the British [[Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5fFEHFs8o?url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2002/ukpga_20020041_en_2 Part 1 Nationality], Office of Public Sector Information, at Web Cite.org&lt;/ref&gt; gave power to the [[Home Secretary]] to ‘deprive a person of a citizenship status if the Secretary of State is satisfied that the person has done anything seriously prejudicial to the vital interests’ of the United Kingdom etc., except in the case where such might render the person [[statelessness|stateless]].&lt;ref&gt;For a comparative analysis of modes of loss of citizenship of 30 European states, see De Groot, G.R. and M. Vink (2010). [http://eudo-citizenship.eu/docs/Loss.pdf  "Loss of Citizenship: Trends and Regulations in Europe"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302113736/http://eudo-citizenship.eu/docs/Loss.pdf |date=2012-03-02 }}. Comparative Report RSCAS/EUDO-CIT-Comp. 2010/4. Florence: EUDO Citizenship Observatory, pp. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In Canada ====
Under Canadian citizenship law citizenship can be revoked by an order from the federal cabinet if:

* Naturalized Canadians is convicted of fraud in relation to their citizenship application or original admission to Canada as an immigrant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawa-revoking-citizenship-of-more-than-3000-after-fraud-investigation/article4532222/ |title=Ottawa revoking citizenship of more than 3,000 after fraud investigation |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past (pre-1977) revoking citizenship was more broad:

* Naturalization in another country
* Long residence overseas (before 1967)
* Lost based on parent's loss of Canadian citizenship

Those who are revoked can appeal to the [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court of Canada]].

==== In South Africa ====
[[File:Bantustans in South Africa.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Map of the [[bantustan|black homelands]] in [[South Africa]] at the end of [[Apartheid]] in 1994]]
{{main|Bantustan}}
In [[Apartheid]]-era South Africa, the [[Bantu Homelands Citizenship Act, 1970]], removed South African citizenship from [[Black South Africans]], making them citizens of nominally-independent or self-governing tribal "homelands", the [[Bantustan]]s — none of which achieved international recognition. In parallel with the creation of the homelands, South Africa's black population was subjected to a massive programme of forced relocation. It has been estimated that 3.5 million people were forced from their homes from the 1960s through the 1980s, many being resettled in the Bantustans.&lt;!-- unsourced in [[Bantustan]] --&gt;

With the demise of the apartheid regime in South Africa in 1994, the Bantustans were dismantled and their territory reincorporated into the Republic of South Africa. The drive to achieve this was spearheaded by the [[African National Congress]] as a central element of its programme of reform. The Bantu Homelands Citizenship Act itself was repealed by the [[South African Constitution of 1993|1993 Interim Constitution]], with all citizens being restored to their South African citizenship.

=== Between World Wars ===
Before [[World War I]], only a small number of countries had laws governing denaturalization that could be enforced against citizens guilty of "lacking [[patriotism]]". Such denaturalized citizens became [[stateless person]]s. During and after the war, most European countries passed amendments to revoke naturalization.&lt;ref name="Arendt"&gt;[[John Hope Simpson]], ''The Refugee Problem'', [[Institute of International Affairs]], October 1939, quoted by [[Hannah Arendt]], ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' (1951), section 2 on [[Imperialism]], last chapter&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Homo Sacer|Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power or Bare Life]]'' (1998), philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] mentioned a number of denaturalization laws that were passed after World War I by most European countries:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is important to note that starting with the period of World War&amp;nbsp;I, many European states began to introduce laws which permitted their own citizens to be denaturalized and denationalized. The first was France, in 1915, with regard to naturalized citizens of "enemy" origins; in 1922 the example was followed by Belgium, which revoked the naturalization of citizens who had committed "anti-national" acts during the war; in 1926 the Fascist regime in Italy passed a similar law concerning citizens who had shown themselves to be "unworthy of Italian citizenship"; in 1933 it was Austria's turn, and so forth, until in 1935 the [[Nuremberg Laws]] divided German citizens into full citizens and citizens without political rights. These laws—and the mass statelessness that ensued—mark a decisive turning point in the life of the modern nation-state and its definitive emancipation from the naive notions of "people" and "citizen"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 1915 French denaturalization law applied only to naturalized citizens with "enemy origins" who had kept their original nationality. Later under [[Raymond Poincaré]]'s government, another law was passed in 1927 which entitled the government to denaturalize any new citizen who committed acts contrary to the [[national interest]].

In 1916, Portugal passed a law which automatically denaturalized all citizens born to a German father.

In 1922, Belgium enacted a law revoking the naturalization of persons accused of having committed "antinational acts" during the war; this was supplemented in 1934 by a new decree against people "in dereliction of their duties as Belgian citizens."

After 1926 in Italy, people who were deemed not to deserve the Italian citizenship or who were considered to represent a threat to the [[public order]] could lose their naturalization.

Egypt in 1926 and Turkey in 1928 enacted laws authorizing denaturalization of any person threatening the public order. Austria passed a similar law in 1933 by which it could denaturalize any citizen who participated in a hostile action against the state. Russia also passed several similar decrees after 1921.&lt;ref name="Arendt"/&gt;

In 1933, [[Nazi Germany]] passed a law authorizing it to denaturalize any person "living abroad" and began restricting the citizenship rights of naturalized citizens of Jewish origin, followed in 1935 by citizens by birth on the basis of the [[Nuremberg laws]].

During [[Vichy France]], 15,000 persons, mostly Jews, were denaturalized (between June 1940 and August 1944), following the setting up, in July 1940, of a Commission charged of revision of naturalizations since the 1927 reform of the nationality law.&lt;ref&gt;François Masure, "''Etat et identité nationale. Un rapport ambigu à propos des naturalisés'', in ''Journal des anthropologues'', hors-série 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;39–49 (see p.&amp;nbsp;48) (in French).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Before World War I ===
In the United States, the proposed, but never ratified, [[Titles of Nobility amendment]] of 1810 would revoke the American citizenship of anyone who would "accept, claim, receive or retain, any title of nobility" or who would receive any gifts or honors from a foreign power.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2590">An '''obligation''' is a course of action that someone is required to take, whether [[legal obligation|legal]] or [[moral obligation|moral]].  There are also obligations in other normative contexts, such as obligations of [[etiquette]], [[social]] obligations, [[religious]] and possibly in terms of [[politics]], where obligations are requirements which must be fulfilled. These are generally [[legal]] obligations, which can incur a penalty for non-fulfilment, although certain people are obliged to carry out certain actions for other reasons as well, whether as a [[tradition]] or for social reasons.

Obligations vary from person to person: for example, a person holding a political office will generally have far more obligations than an average adult citizen, who themselves will have more obligations than a child.&lt;ref&gt;Old Bear, ''Sacred Journey of the Medicine Wheel'' (2008), p. 393: "Adults have more obligations and are held to higher standards of accountability than children are".&lt;/ref&gt; Obligations are generally granted in return for an increase in an individual's rights or power.  For example, obligations for health and safety in a workplace from employer to employee maybe to ensure the fire exit is not blocked or ensure that the plugs are put in firmly.

The word "obligation" can also designate a written obligation, or such things as bank notes, coins, checks, bonds, stamps, or securities.

==Other uses==
The term obligate can also be used in a biological context, in reference to species which must occupy a certain niche or behave in a certain way in order to survive. In biology, the opposite of obligate is [[facultative]], meaning that a species is able to behave in a certain way and may do so under certain circumstances, but that it can also survive without having to behave this way. For example, species of salamanders in the family [[Proteidae]] are obligate [[paedomorphs]], whereas species belonging to the [[Ambystomatidae]] are facultative paedomorphs.

In the Catholic Church, [[Holy Days of Obligation]] or Holidays of Obligation, less commonly called Feasts of Precept, are the days on which, as canon 1247 of the [[Code of Canon Law]] states, the faithful are obliged to participate in the [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]].

'''Political philosophy''', also known as '''political theory''', is the study of topics such as [[politics]], [[liberty]], [[justice]], [[property]], [[rights]], [[law]], and the enforcement of laws by [[authority]]: what they are, why (or even if) they are needed, what, if anything, makes a [[The purpose of government|government legitimate]], what rights and freedoms it should protect and why, what form it should take and why, what the law is, and what duties citizens owe to a legitimate government, if any, and when it may be legitimately overthrown, if ever.

In a [[vernacular]] sense, the term "political philosophy" often refers to a general view, or specific ethic, political belief or attitude, about politics, synonymous to the term "[[political ideology]]".

Political philosophy is a branch of [[philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Leo (1959). An introduction to Political Philosophy. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Within [[political science]], a strong focus has historically been placed on the role of political philosophy (also known as [[normative theory]]), [[moral philosophy]] and the [[humanities]], although in recent years there has been increased focus to political theory based on [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] methodological approaches as well as [[economic theory]], the [[natural sciences]] and [[behaviouralism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Savigny |first1=Heather |last2=Marsden |first2=Lee |title=Doing Political Science and International Relations: Theories in Action |date=2011 |publisher=Macmillan International Higher Education |isbn=9780230344136 |page=13 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CaUcBQAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient traditions ===

==== Ancient India ====
[[Indian political philosophy]]  in ancient times demarcated a clear distinction between (1) nation and state (2) religion and state. The constitutions of Hindu states evolved over time and were based on political and legal treatises and prevalent social institutions. The institutions of state were broadly divided into governance, administration, defense, law and order. ''Mantranga,'' the principal governing body of these states, consisted of the King, Prime Minister, Commander in chief of army, Chief Priest of the King. The Prime Minister headed the committee of ministers along with head of executive (Maha Amatya).

[[Chanakya]] was a 4th-century BC Indian political philosopher. The ''[[Arthashastra]]'' provides an account of the science of politics for a wise ruler, policies for foreign affairs and wars, the system of a spy state and surveillance and economic stability of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Roger Boesche|last=Boesche|first=Roger|title=The First Great Political Realist: Kautilya and His Arthashastra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K85NA7Rg67wC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=isbn%3A0739106074&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2002|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=0-7391-0401-2|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chanakya quotes several authorities including Bruhaspati, Ushanas, Prachetasa Manu, Parasara, and Ambi, and described himself as a descendant of a lineage of political philosophers, with his father Chanaka being his immediate predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rangarajan|first1=L N|title=The Arthashastra |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3jbzZkoR36QC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PT22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2000|publisher=Penguin UK|isbn=9788184750119|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another influential extant Indian treatise on political philosophy is the Sukra Neeti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=D.

==== Ancient China ====
Chinese political philosophy dates back to the [[Spring and Autumn period]], specifically with Confucius in the 6th century BC. Chinese political philosophy was developed as a response to the social and political breakdown of the country characteristic of the Spring and Autumn period and the [[Warring States period]]. The major philosophies during the period, [[Confucianism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], [[Mohism]], [[School of Agrarianism|Agrarianism]] and [[Taoism]], each had a political aspect to their philosophical schools. Philosophers such as [[Confucius]], [[Mencius]], and [[Mozi]], focused on political unity and political stability as the basis of their political philosophies. Confucianism advocated a hierarchical, [[meritocracy|meritocratic]] government based on empathy, loyalty, and interpersonal relationships. Legalism advocated a highly [[authoritarian]] government based on [[wikt:draconian|draconian]] punishments and laws.

==== Ancient Greece ====
Western political philosophy originates in the philosophy of [[ancient Greece]], where political philosophy dates back to at least Plato.&lt;ref name="Sahakian 1993 59"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sahakian|first=Mabel Lewis|title=Ideas of the great philosophers|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Vi7cQMw8SwYC&amp;pg=PA59|year=1993|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Publishing|isbn=978-1-56619-271-2|page=59|quote=...

One of the first, extremely important classical works of political philosophy is Plato's ''Republic'',&lt;ref name="Sahakian 1993 59"/&gt; which was followed by [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' and [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kraut|first=Richard|title=Aristotle: political philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9BDmX3FBbS4C&amp;pg=PA3|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-878200-1|page=3|quote=To understand and assess Aristotle's contributions to political thought ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roman political philosophy was influenced by the [[Stoics]] and the Roman statesman [[Cicero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Radford|first=Robert T.|title=Cicero: a study in the origins of republican philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1cKLGcvuYxQC&amp;pg=PA1|year=2002|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-420-1467-1|page=1|quote=His most lasting political contribution is in his work on political philosophy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Saint Augustine ====

The early [[Christian philosophy]] of [[Augustine of Hippo]] was heavily influenced by Plato. A key change brought about by Christian thought was the moderation of the [[Stoicism]] and theory of [[justice]] of the Roman world, as well emphasis on the role of the state in applying [[mercy]] as a [[moral example]]. Augustine also preached that one was not a member of his or her city, but was either a citizen of the [[City of God (book)|City of God]] (Civitas Dei) or the City of Man ([[Civitas]] Terrena). Augustine's ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' is an influential work of this period that attacked the thesis, held by many Christian Romans, that the Christian view could be realized on [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schall|first=James V.|title=At the Limits of Political Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yZK79kiFFtsC&amp;pg=PA40|year=1998|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-0922-7|page=40|quote=In political philosophy, St. Augustine was a follower of Plato ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== St. Thomas Aquinas ====
{{main|Treatise on Law}}

[[Thomas Aquinas]] meticulously dealt with the varieties of [[philosophy of law|law]]. According to Aquinas, there are four kinds of law:

# Eternal law ("the divine government of everything")
# Divine positive law (having been "posited" by God; external to human nature)
# [[Natural law]] (the right way of living discoverable by natural reason; what cannot-not be known; internal to human nature)
# Human law (what we commonly call "[[law]]"—including [[customary law]]; the law of the ''[[Communitas Perfecta]]'')

Aquinas never discusses the nature or categorization of [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]]. There is scholarly debate surrounding the place of canon law within the Thomistic jurisprudential framework.

Aquinas was an incredibly influential thinker in the [[Natural law|Natural Law tradition]].

The rise of [[Islam]], based on both the [[Qur'an]] and [[Muhammad]] strongly altered the power balances and perceptions of origin of power in the Mediterranean region. [[Early Islamic philosophy]] emphasized an inexorable link between [[science]] and [[religion]], and the process of [[ijtihad]] to find [[truth]]—in effect ''all'' philosophy was "[[Political aspects of Islam|political]]" as it had real implications for governance. This view was challenged by the "rationalist" [[Mutazilite]] philosophers, who held a more [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenic]] view, reason above revelation, and as such are known to modern scholars as the first [[speculative philosophy|speculative]] theologians of Islam; they were supported by a secular aristocracy who sought freedom of action independent of the [[Caliphate]]. By the late ancient period, however, the "traditionalist" [[Asharite]] view of Islam had in general triumphed. According to the Asharites, reason must be subordinate to the Quran and the Sunna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aslan|first=Reza|authorlink=Reza Aslan|title=No god but God|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AkyupJn81RMC&amp;pg=PA153|year=2005|publisher=Random House Inc.|isbn=978-1-58836-445-6|page=153|quote=By the ninth and tenth centuries... }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islamic philosophy|Islamic political philosophy]], was, indeed, rooted in the very sources of [[Islam]]—i.e., the [[Qur'an]] and the [[Sunnah]], the words and practices of Muhammad—thus making it essentially theocratic. However, in the Western thought, it is generally supposed that it was a specific area peculiar merely to the great philosophers of Islam: [[al-Kindi]] (Alkindus), [[al-Farabi]] (Abunaser), [[Avicenna|İbn Sina]] (Avicenna), [[Ibn Bajjah]] (Avempace) and [[Averroes|Ibn Rushd]] (Averroes). The political conceptions of Islam such as kudrah (power), [[sultan]], [[ummah]], cemaa (obligation)-and even the "core" terms of the Qur'an—i.e., [[ibadah]] (worship), din (religion), rab (master) and [[ilah]] (deity)—is taken as the basis of an analysis. Hence, not only the ideas of the Muslim political philosophers but also many other [[Fiqh|jurists]] and [[Ulema|ulama]] posed political ideas and theories. For example, the ideas of the [[Kharijites|Khawarij]] in the very early years of [[Muslim history|Islamic history]] on [[Caliphate|Khilafa]] and [[Ummah]], or that of [[Shia Islam]] on the concept of [[Imamah]] are considered proofs of political thought. The clashes between the [[Sunni Islam|Ehl-i Sunna]] and [[Shia Islam|Shia]] in the 7th and 8th centuries had a genuine political character. Political thought was not purely rooted in theism, however. [[Aristotelianism|Aristotleanism]] flourished as the Islamic Golden Age saw rise to a continuation of the [[Peripatetic school|peripaetic]] philosophers who implemented the ideas of [[Aristotle]] in the context of the Islamic world. Abunaser, Avicenna and Ibn Rushd where part of this philosophical school who claimed that human reason surpassed mere coincidence and revelation. They believed, for example, that natural phenomena occurs because of certain rules (made by god), not because god interfered directly (unlike Al-Ghazali and his followers).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/al-Farabi|title=Al-Fārābī {{!}} Muslim philosopher|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/avicenna/#H5|title=Avicenna (Ibn Sina) {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-04-22|title=Averroes|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Averroes&amp;oldid=837663527|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/al-Ghazali|title=Al-Ghazālī {{!}} Muslim jurist, theologian, and mystic|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable political philosophers of the time include [[Nizam al-Mulk]], a Persian scholar and [[vizier]] of the Seljuq Empire who composed the ''[[Siyasatnama]]'', or the "Book of Government" in English. In it, he details the role of the state in terms of political affairs (i.e. how to deal with political opponents without ruining the government's image), as well as its duty to protect the poor and reward the worthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-06-30|title=Siyasatnama|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Siyasatnama&amp;oldid=788295179|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his other work, he explains how the state should deal with other issues such as supplying jobs to immigrants like the [[Turkmens]] who were coming from the north (present day southern Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nizam-al-Mulk-Seljuq-vizier|title=Niẓām al-Mulk {{!}} Seljuq vizier|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ibn Khaldun ====

The 14th-century [[Arab]] scholar [[Ibn Khaldun]] is considered one of the greatest political theorists. The British philosopher-anthropologist [[Ernest Gellner]] considered Ibn Khaldun's definition of [[government]], "...an institution which prevents injustice other than such as it commits itself," the best in the history of political theory. For Ibn Khaldun, government should be restrained to a minimum for as a necessary evil, it is the constraint of men by other men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gellner|first=Ernest|authorlink=Ernest Gellner|title=Plough, Sword, and Book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WwduQjFiB7kC&amp;pg=PA239|year=1992|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-28702-7|page=239|quote=Ibn Khaldun's definition of government probably remains the best: ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval Europe ===
[[Medieval]] political philosophy in [[Europe]] was heavily influenced by [[Christian]] thinking. It had much in common with the Mutazilite [[Islamic]] thinking in that the [[Roman Catholic]]s though subordinating [[philosophy]] to [[theology]] did not subject reason to revelation but in the case of contradictions, subordinated reason to faith as the Asharite of Islam. The Scholastics by combining the philosophy of Aristotle with the Christianity of St. Augustine emphasized the potential harmony inherent in reason and revelation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koetsier|first=L. S.|title=Natural Law and Calvinist Political Theory|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7uLE3DynB0YC&amp;pg=PA19|year=2004|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=978-1-4122-1440-7|page=19|quote=...the Medieval Scholastics revived the concept of natural law. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most influential political philosopher of medieval Europe was St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] who helped reintroduce [[Aristotle]]'s works, which had only been transmitted to [[Catholic]] [[Europe]] through [[Muslim]] [[Spain]], along with the commentaries of [[Averroes]]. Aquinas's use of them set the agenda, for [[scholasticism|scholastic]] political philosophy dominated European thought for centuries even unto the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Copleston|first=Frederick|title=A history of philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=y_382o-fpOsC&amp;pg=PA346|volume=3|year=1999|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-86012-296-8|page=346|quote=There was, however, at least one department of thought ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval political philosophers, such as Aquinas in ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', developed the idea that a king who is a tyrant is no king at all and could be overthrown.

[[Magna Carta]], viewed by many as a cornerstone of Anglo-American political liberty, explicitly proposes the right to revolt against the ruler for justice sake. Other documents similar to Magna Carta are found in other European countries such as Spain and Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Valente|first=Claire|title=The theory and practice of revolt in medieval England|url=https://books.google.com/?id=B8yRrtm0LicC&amp;pg=PA14|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-0901-8|page=14|quote=The two starting points of most medieval discussions ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Renaissance ===
During the [[Renaissance]] secular political philosophy began to emerge after about a century of theological political thought in Europe. While the Middle Ages did see secular politics in practice under the rule of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the academic field was wholly [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] and therefore Christian in nature.

==== Niccolò Machiavelli ====

One of the most influential works during this burgeoning period was [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]'', written between 1511–12 and published in 1532, after Machiavelli's death. That work, as well as ''[[Discorsi sopra la prima deca di Tito Livio|The Discourses]]'', a rigorous analysis of the [[Classical antiquity|classical period]], did much to influence modern political thought in the West. A minority (including [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]) interpreted The Prince as a satire meant to be given to the Medici after their recapture of Florence and their subsequent expulsion of Machiavelli from Florence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnston|first=Ian|title=Lecture on Machiavelli's The Prince|publisher=[[Malaspina University College]]|date=February 2002|url=http://www.mala.bc.ca/~Johnstoi/introser/machiavelli.htm|accessdate=2007-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the work was written for the di Medici family in order to perhaps influence them to free him from exile, Machiavelli supported the [[Republic of Florence]] rather than the [[oligarchy]] of the di [[Medici]] family. At any rate, Machiavelli presents a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] and somewhat [[consequentialist]] view of politics, whereby good and evil are mere means used to bring about an end—i.e., the secure and powerful state. [[Thomas Hobbes]], well known for his theory of the [[social contract]], goes on to expand this view at the start of the 17th century during the [[English Renaissance]]. Although neither Machiavelli nor Hobbes believed in the divine right of kings, they both believed in the inherent selfishness of the individual. It was necessarily this belief that led them to adopt a strong central power as the only means of preventing the disintegration of the social order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Copleston|first=Frederick|title=A history of philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=y_382o-fpOsC&amp;pg=PA310|volume=3|year=1999|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-86012-296-8|pages=310–12|quote=...we witness the growth of political absolutism ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Enlightenment ===
[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|right|upright=1.45|thumb|Eugène Delacroix's ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' (1830, Louvre), a painting created at a time when old and modern political philosophies came into violent conflict.]]During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period, new theories about what the human was and is and about the definition of reality and the way it was perceived, along with the discovery of other societies in the Americas, and the changing needs of political societies (especially in the wake of the [[English Civil War]], the [[American Revolution]], the [[French Revolution]]), and the [[Haitian Revolution]] led to new questions and insights by such thinkers as [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]], [[Montesquieu]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].

These theorists were driven by two basic questions: one, by what right or need do people form states; and two, what the best form for a state could be. These fundamental questions involved a conceptual distinction between the concepts of "state" and "government." It was decided that "state" would refer to a set of enduring institutions through which power would be distributed and its use justified. The term "government" would refer to a specific group of people who occupied the institutions of the state, and create the laws and ordinances by which the people, themselves included, would be bound. This conceptual distinction continues to operate in [[political science]], although some political scientists, philosophers, [[history|historians]] and [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]] have argued that most political action in any given society occurs outside of its state, and that there are societies that are not organized into states that nevertheless must be considered in political terms. As long as the concept of [[natural order (philosophy)|natural order]] was not introduced, the [[social sciences]] could not evolve independently of [[theistic]] thinking. Since the cultural revolution of the 17th century in England, which spread to France and the rest of Europe, society has been considered subject to natural laws akin to the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barens|first1=Ingo|last2=Caspari|first2=Volker|last3=Schefold|first3=Bertram|editor1-last=Barens|editor1-first=Ingo|others=Volker Caspari ed., Bertram Schefold ed.|title=Political events and economic ideas|url=https://books.google.com/?id=x6C5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA206|year=2004|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84542-152-6|pages=206–07|quote=Economic theory as political philosophy: the example of the French Enlightenment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political and economic relations were drastically influenced by these theories as the concept of the [[guild]] was subordinated to the theory of [[free trade]], and [[Roman Catholic]] dominance of theology was increasingly challenged by [[Protestant]] churches subordinate to each [[nation-state]], which also (in a fashion the Roman Catholic Church often decried angrily) preached in the vulgar or native language of each region. However, the enlightenment was an outright attack on religion, particularly Christianity. The most outspoken critic of the church in France was [[François Marie Arouet de Voltaire]], a representative figure of the enlightenment. After Voltaire, religion would never be the same again in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Byrne|first=James M.|title=Religion and the Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FcEy8SF63TgC&amp;pg=PA1|year=1997|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-25760-6|pages=1–2|quote=... there emerged groups of freethinkers intent on grounding knowledge on the exercise of critical reason, as opposed to ... established religion ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Ottoman Empire]], these ideological reforms did not take place and these views did not integrate into common thought until much later. As well, there was no spread of this doctrine within the [[New World]] and the advanced civilizations of the [[Aztec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Inca]], [[Mohican]], [[Delaware]], [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and especially the [[Iroquois]]. The [[Iroquois]] philosophy in particular gave much to Christian thought of the time and in many cases actually inspired some of the institutions adopted in the [[United States]]: for example, [[Benjamin Franklin]] was a great admirer of some of the methods of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]], and much of early American literature emphasized the political philosophy of the natives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johansen|first=Bruce Elliott|title=Native American political systems and the evolution of democracy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H593mgxQNu4C&amp;pg=PA69|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30010-3|page=69|quote=... the three-tier system of federalism ... is an inheritance of Iroquois inspiration }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== John Locke ====

[[John Locke]] in particular exemplified this new age of political theory with his work ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''. In it Locke proposes a state of nature theory that directly complements his conception of how political development occurs and how it can be founded through contractual obligation. Locke stood to refute Sir [[Robert Filmer]]'s paternally founded political theory in favor of a natural system based on nature in a particular given system. The theory of the [[divine right of kings]] became a passing fancy, exposed to the type of ridicule with which John Locke treated it. Unlike Machiavelli and Hobbes but like Aquinas, Locke would accept Aristotle's dictum that man seeks to be happy in a state of social harmony as a social animal. Unlike Aquinas's preponderant view on the salvation of the soul from [[original sin]], Locke believes man's mind comes into this world as [[tabula rasa]]. For Locke, knowledge is neither innate, revealed nor based on authority but subject to uncertainty tempered by reason, tolerance and moderation. According to Locke, an absolute ruler as proposed by Hobbes is unnecessary, for natural law is based on reason and seeking peace and survival for man.

=== Industrialization and the Modern Era ===
The [[Karl Marx|Marxist]] critique of capitalism—developed with [[Friedrich Engels]]—was, alongside liberalism and fascism, one of the defining ideological movements of the twentieth century. The [[industrial revolution]] produced a parallel revolution in political thought. [[Urbanization]] and [[capitalism]] greatly reshaped society. During this same period, the [[History of Socialism|socialist movement]] began to form. In the mid-19th century, [[Marxism]] was developed, and [[socialism]] in general gained increasing popular support, mostly from the urban working class. Without breaking entirely from the past, Marx established principles that would be used by future revolutionaries of the 20th century namely [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Mao Zedong]], [[Ho Chi Minh]], and [[Fidel Castro]]. Though [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s philosophy of history is similar to [[Immanuel Kant]]'s, and [[Karl Marx]]'s theory of revolution towards the common good is partly based on Kant's view of history—Marx declared that he was turning Hegel's dialectic, which was "standing on its head", "the right side up again".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/p3.htm|title=Capital Volume One, Afterword to the Second German Edition|last=Marx|first=Karl|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Marx who believed in [[historical materialism]], Hegel believed in the ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kain|first=Philip J.|title=Marx and modern political theory|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kvG8DVBeT9QC&amp;pg=PA1|year=1993|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8476-7866-2|pages=1–4|quote=Some of his texts, especially the ''Communist Manifesto'' made him seem like a sort of communist Descartes ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 19th century, [[socialism]] and [[trade union]]s were established members of the political landscape. In addition, the various branches of [[anarchism]], with thinkers such as [[Mikhail Bakunin]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] or [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[syndicalism]] also gained some prominence. In the Anglo-American world, [[anti-imperialism]] and [[pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] began gaining currency at the turn of the 20th century.{{Citation needed|reason=Pluralism possibly earlier|date=April 2017}}

[[World War I]] was a watershed event in human history, changing views of governments and politics. The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] (and similar, albeit less successful, revolutions in many other European countries) brought [[communism]]—and in particular the political theory of [[Leninism]], but also on a smaller level [[Luxemburgism]] (gradually)—on the world stage. At the same time, [[social democracy|social democratic]] parties won elections and formed governments for the first time, often as a result of the introduction of [[universal suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aspalter|first=Christian|title=Importance of Christian and Social Democratic movements in welfare politics|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vouKut-RAYoC&amp;pg=PA70|year=2001|publisher=Nova Publishers|isbn=978-1-56072-975-4|page=70|quote=The pressing need for universal suffrage ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary ==
From the end of [[World War II]] until 1971, when [[John Rawls]] published ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', political philosophy declined in the Anglo-American academic world, as analytic philosophers expressed skepticism about the possibility that normative judgments had cognitive content, and political science turned toward statistical methods and [[behavioralism]]. In continental Europe, on the other hand, the postwar decades saw a huge blossoming of political philosophy, with [[Marxism]] dominating the field. This was the time of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Louis Althusser]], and the victories of [[Mao Zedong]] in [[China]] and [[Fidel Castro]] in [[Cuba]], as well as the events of [[May 1968]] led to increased interest in revolutionary ideology, especially by the [[New Left]]. A number of continental European émigrés to Britain and the United States—including [[Karl Popper]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Leo Strauss]], [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Eric Voegelin]] and [[Judith Shklar]]—encouraged continued study in political philosophy in the Anglo-American world, but in the 1950s and 1960s they and their students remained at odds with the analytic establishment.

[[Communism]] remained an important focus especially during the 1950s and 1960s. [[Colonialism]] and [[racism]] were important issues that arose. In general, there was a marked trend towards a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] approach to political issues, rather than a philosophical one. Much academic debate regarded one or both of two pragmatic topics: how (or whether) to apply [[utilitarianism]] to problems of political policy, or how (or whether) to apply economic models (such as [[rational choice theory]]) to political issues. The rise of [[feminism]], [[LGBT social movements]] and the end of colonial rule and of the political exclusion of such minorities as [[African Americans]] and sexual minorities in the developed world has led to feminist, [[postcolonial]], and [[multicultural]] thought becoming significant. This led to a challenge to the [[social contract]] by philosophers [[Charles W. Mills]] in his book ''[[The Racial Contract]]'' and [[Carole Pateman]] in her book ''[[The Sexual Contract]]'' that the social contract excluded persons of colour and women respectively.

In Anglo-American academic political philosophy, the publication of [[John Rawls]]'s ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' in 1971 is considered a milestone. Rawls used a [[thought experiment]], the [[original position]], in which representative parties choose principles of justice for the basic structure of society from behind a veil of ignorance. Rawls also offered a criticism of utilitarian approaches to questions of political justice. [[Robert Nozick]]'s 1974 book ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'', which won a [[National Book Award]], responded to Rawls from a [[libertarianism|libertarian]] perspective and gained academic respectability for libertarian viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;David Lewis Schaefer, [http://www.nysun.com/sports/reconsiderations-robert-nozick-and-coast-utopia Robert Nozick and the Coast of Utopia], [[The New York Sun]], April 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporaneously with the rise of analytic ethics in Anglo-American thought, in Europe several new lines of philosophy directed at critique of existing societies arose between the 1950s and 1980s. Most of these took elements of Marxist economic analysis, but combined them with a more cultural or ideological emphasis. Out of the [[Frankfurt School]], thinkers like [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimer]], and [[Jürgen Habermas]] combined Marxian and Freudian perspectives. Along somewhat different lines, a number of other continental thinkers—still largely influenced by Marxism—put new emphases on [[structuralism]] and on a "return to [[Hegel]]". Within the (post-) structuralist line (though mostly not taking that label) are thinkers such as [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Claude Lefort]], and [[Jean Baudrillard]]. The [[Situationist International|Situationists]] were more influenced by Hegel; [[Guy Debord]], in particular, moved a Marxist analysis of [[commodity fetishism]] to the realm of consumption, and looked at the relation between consumerism and dominant ideology formation.

Another debate developed around the (distinct) criticisms of liberal political theory made by [[Michael Walzer]], [[Michael Sandel]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]. The [[Liberalism|liberal]]-[[communitarian]] debate is often considered valuable for generating a new set of philosophical problems, rather than a profound and illuminating clash of perspective.These and other communitarians (such as [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] and [[Daniel A. Bell]]) argue that, contra liberalism, communities are prior to individuals and therefore should be the center of political focus. Communitarians tend to support greater local control as well as economic and social policies which encourage the growth of [[social capital]].

A pair of overlapping political perspectives arising toward the end of the 20th century are [[republicanism]] (or neo- or civic-republicanism) and the [[capability approach]]. The resurgent republican movement aims to provide an alternate definition of liberty from [[Isaiah Berlin]]'s positive and negative forms of liberty, namely "liberty as non-domination." Unlike the American liberal movement which understands liberty as "non-interference," "non-domination" entails individuals not being subject to the arbitrary will of any other person. To a liberal, a slave who is not interfered with may be free, yet to a republican the mere status as a slave, regardless of how that slave is treated, is objectionable. Prominent republicans include historian [[Quentin Skinner]], jurist [[Cass Sunstein]], and political philosopher [[Philip Pettit]]. The capability approach, pioneered by economists [[Mahbub ul Haq]] and [[Amartya Sen]] and further developed by legal scholar [[Martha Nussbaum]], understands freedom under allied lines: the real-world ability to act. Both the capability approach and republicanism treat choice as something which must be resourced. In other words, it is not enough to be legally able to do something, but to have the real option of doing it.

Current emphasis on "commoditization of the everyday" has been decried by many contemporary theorists, some of them arguing the full brunt of it would be felt in ten years' time. "Pricing" such ethical categories like personal relations or sex, though always present, pushed by media agenda, is thus seen as crossing boundaries and having adverse societal and philosophical consequences.

A prominent subject in recent political philosophy is the theory of [[deliberative democracy]]. The seminal work was done by Jurgen Habermas in [[Germany]], but the most extensive literature has been in English, led by theorists such as [[Jane Mansbridge]], Joshua Cohen, Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson.&lt;ref&gt;Gutmann, Amy, and Dennis Thompson, ''Democracy and Disagreement'' (Princeton University Press, 1996). Also see Gutmann and Thompson, ''Why Deliberative Democracy?'' (Princeton University Press, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influential political philosophers ==
A larger [[list of political philosophers]] is intended to be closer to exhaustive. Listed below are some of the most [[Archetype|canonical]] or important thinkers, and especially philosophers whose central focus was in political philosophy and/or who are good representatives of a particular school of thought.
* [[Thomas Aquinas]]: In synthesizing Christian theology and Peripatetic (Aristotelian) teaching in his ''[[Treatise on Law]]'', Aquinas contends that God's gift of higher reason—manifest in human law by way of the divine virtues—gives way to the assembly of righteous government.
* [[Aristotle]]: Wrote his ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' as an extension of his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''. Notable for the theories that humans are social animals, and that the [[polis]] (Ancient Greek city state) existed to bring about the good life appropriate to such animals. His political theory is based upon an ethics of [[perfectionism (philosophy)|perfectionism]] (as is [[Marx]]'s, on some readings).
* [[Mikhail Bakunin]]: After [[Pierre Joseph Proudhon]], Bakunin became the most important political philosopher of [[anarchism]]. His specific version of anarchism is called [[collectivist anarchism]].
* [[Jeremy Bentham]]: The first thinker to analyze social justice in terms of maximization of aggregate individual benefits. Founded the philosophical/ethical school of thought known as [[utilitarianism]].
* [[Isaiah Berlin]]: Developed the distinction between positive and negative liberty.
* [[Edmund Burke]]: Irish member of the British parliament, Burke is credited with the creation of conservative thought. Burke's ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' is the most popular of his writings where he denounced the French revolution. Burke was one of the biggest supporters of the American Revolution.
* [[Confucius]]: The first thinker to relate ethics to the political order.
* [[William E. Connolly]]: Helped introduce postmodern philosophy into political theory, and promoted new theories of [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|Pluralism]] and [[agonistic democracy]].
* [[John Dewey]]: Co-founder of [[pragmatism]] and analyzed the essential role of education in the maintenance of democratic government.
* [[Han Feizi]]: The major figure of the Chinese Fajia ([[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalist]]) school, advocated government that adhered to laws and a strict method of administration.
* [[Michel Foucault]]: Critiqued the modern conception of power on the basis of the [[prison–industrial complex|prison complex]] and other prohibitive institutions, such as those that designate sexuality, madness and knowledge as the roots of their infrastructure, a critique that demonstrated that subjection is the power formation of subjects in any linguistic forum and that revolution cannot just be thought as the reversal of power between classes.
* [[Antonio Gramsci]]: Instigated the concept of ''[[hegemony]]''. Argued that the [[Sovereign state|state]] and the ruling class uses [[culture]] and [[ideology]] to gain the consent of the classes it rules over.
* [[Thomas Hill Green]]: Modern liberal thinker and early supporter of [[positive freedom]].
* [[Jürgen Habermas]]: Contemporary democratic theorist and sociologist. He has pioneered such concepts as the [[public sphere]], [[communicative action]], and [[deliberative democracy]]. His early work was heavily influenced by the [[Frankfurt School]].
* [[Friedrich Hayek]]: He argued that central planning was inefficient because members of central bodies could not know enough to match the preferences of consumers and workers with existing conditions. Hayek further argued that [[command economy|central economic planning]]—a mainstay of socialism—would lead to a "total" state with dangerous power. He advocated [[free-market]] capitalism in which the main role of the state is to maintain the [[rule of law]] and let spontaneous order develop.
* [[G. W. F. Hegel]]: Emphasized the "cunning" of history, arguing that it followed a rational trajectory, even while embodying seemingly irrational forces; influenced Marx, [[Kierkegaard]], [[Nietzsche]], and [[Michael Oakeshott|Oakeshott]].
* [[Thomas Hobbes]]: Generally considered to have first articulated how the concept of a [[social contract]] that justifies the actions of rulers (even where contrary to the individual desires of governed citizens), can be reconciled with a conception of sovereignty.
* [[David Hume]]: Hume criticized the social contract theory of John Locke and others as resting on a myth of some actual agreement. Hume was a realist in recognizing the role of force to forge the existence of states and that [[consent of the governed]] was merely hypothetical. He also introduced the concept of [[utility]], later picked up on and developed by [[Jeremy Bentham]].
* [[Thomas Jefferson]]: Politician and political theorist during the [[American Enlightenment]]. Expanded on the philosophy of Thomas Paine by instrumenting [[republicanism]] in the United States. Most famous for the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].
* [[Immanuel Kant]]: Argued that participation in civil society is undertaken not for self-preservation, as per [[Hobbes|Thomas Hobbes]], but as a moral duty. First modern thinker who fully analyzed structure and meaning of obligation. Argued that an international organization was needed to preserve world peace.
* [[Peter Kropotkin]]: One of the classic anarchist thinkers and the most influential theorist of [[anarcho-communism]].
* [[John Locke]]: Like Hobbes, described a social contract theory based on citizens' fundamental rights in the [[state of nature]]. He departed from Hobbes in that, based on the assumption of a society in which moral values are independent of governmental authority and widely shared, he argued for a government with power limited to the protection of personal property. His arguments may have been deeply influential to the formation of the [[United States Constitution]].
* [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]: First systematic analyses of: (1) how consent of a populace is negotiated between and among rulers rather than simply a naturalistic (or theological) given of the structure of society; (2) precursor to the concept of ideology in articulating the epistemological structure of commands and law.
* [[James Madison]]: American politician and protege of Jefferson considered to be "Father of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]" and "Father of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]" of the United States. As a political theorist, he believed in [[separation of powers]] and proposed a comprehensive set of [[Separation of powers#Checks_and_balances|checks and balances]] that are necessary to protect the rights of an individual from the [[tyranny of the majority]].
* [[Herbert Marcuse]]: Called the father of the [[new left]]. One of the principal thinkers within the [[Frankfurt School]], and generally important in efforts to fuse the thought of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Karl Marx]]. Introduced the concept of "[[repressive desublimation]]", in which social control can operate not only by direct control, but also by manipulation of desire. His work [[Eros and Civilization]] and notion of a non-repressive society was influential on the 1960s and its counter-cultural social movements.
* [[Karl Marx]]: In large part, added the historical dimension to an understanding of society, culture and economics. Created the concept of ''ideology'' in the sense of (true or false) beliefs that shape and control social actions. Analyzed the fundamental nature of class as a mechanism of governance and social interaction. Profoundly influenced world politics with his theory of communism.
* [[Mencius]]: One of the most important thinkers in the Confucian school, he is the first theorist to make a coherent argument for an obligation of rulers to the ruled.
* [[John Stuart Mill]]: A [[utilitarian]], and the person who named the system; he goes further than Bentham by laying the foundation for liberal democratic thought in general and modern, as opposed to classical, liberalism in particular. Articulated the place of individual liberty in an otherwise utilitarian framework.
* [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]]: Analyzed protection of the people by a "balance of powers" in the divisions of a state.
* [[John Rawls]]: Revitalized the study of normative political philosophy in Anglo-American universities with his 1971 book [[A Theory of Justice]], which uses a version of [[social contract theory]] to answer fundamental questions about [[justice]] and to criticise [[utilitarianism]].
* [[Mozi]]: Eponymous founder of the Mohist school, advocated a form of [[Mohist consequentialism|consequentialism]].
* [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]: Philosopher who became a powerful influence on a broad spectrum of 20th-century political currents in [[Marxism]], [[anarchism]], [[fascism]], [[socialism]], [[libertarianism]], and [[conservatism]]. His interpreters have debated the content of his political philosophy.
* [[Robert Nozick]]: Criticized Rawls, and argued for [[libertarianism]], by appeal to a hypothetical history of the [[State (polity)|state]] and of [[property]].
* [[Thomas Paine]]: [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] writer who defended [[liberal democracy]], the [[American Revolution]], and [[French Revolution]] in ''[[Common Sense]]'' and The ''[[Rights of Man]]''.
* [[Plato]]: Wrote a lengthy dialog ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' in which he laid out his political philosophy: citizens should be divided into three categories. One category of people are the rulers: they should be philosophers, according to Plato, this idea is based on his [[Theory of Forms]].
* [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]: Commonly considered the father of modern [[anarchism]], specifically [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]].
* [[Ayn Rand]]: Founder of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] and prime mover of the Objectivist and Libertarian movements in mid-twentieth-century America. Advocated a complete, laissez-faire capitalism. Rand held that the proper role of government was exclusively the protection of individual rights without economic interference. The government was to be separated from economics the same way and for the same reasons it was separated from religion. Any governmental action not directed at the defense of individual rights would constitute the initiation of force (or threat of force), and therefore a violation not only of rights but also of the legitimate function of government.
* [[Murray Rothbard]]: The central theorist of [[anarcho-capitalism]] and an [[Austrian School]] economist.
* [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]: Analyzed the social contract as an expression of the [[general will]], and controversially argued in favor of absolute [[democracy]] where the people at large would act as [[Sovereignty|sovereign]].
* [[Carl Schmitt]]: German political theorist, tied to the Nazis, who developed the concepts of the Friend/Enemy Distinction and the State of exception. Though his most influential books were written in the 1920s, he continued to write prolifically until his death (in academic quasi-exile) in 1985. He heavily influenced 20th-century political philosophy both within the Frankfurt School and among others, not all of whom are philosophers, such as [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Hannah Arendt]], and [[Giorgio Agamben]].
* [[Adam Smith]]: Often said to have founded modern [[economics]]; explained emergence of economic benefits from the self-interested behavior ("the invisible hand") of artisans and traders. While praising its efficiency, Smith also expressed concern about the effects of industrial labor (e.g., repetitive activity) on workers. His work on moral sentiments sought to explain social bonds which enhance economic activity.
* [[Socrates]]: Widely considered the founder of Western political philosophy, via his spoken influence on Athenian contemporaries; since Socrates never wrote anything, much of what we know about him and his teachings comes through his most famous student, Plato.
* [[Baruch Spinoza]]: Set forth the first analysis of ''[[rational egoism]]'', in which the rational interest of self is conformance with pure reason. To Spinoza's thinking, in a society in which each individual is guided by reason, political authority would be superfluous.
* [[Max Stirner]]: Important thinker within [[anarchism]] and the main representative of the anarchist current known as [[individualist anarchism]].
* [[Leo Strauss]]: Famously rejected modernity, mostly on the grounds of what he perceived to be modern political philosophy's excessive self-sufficiency of reason and flawed philosophical grounds for moral and political normativity. He argued instead we should return to pre-modern thinkers for answers to contemporary issues. His philosophy was influential on the formation of [[Neo-Conservativism]], and a number of his students later were members of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]].
* [[Henry David Thoreau]]: Influential American thinker on such diverse later political positions and topics such as [[pacifism]], [[anarchism]], [[environmentalism]] and [[civil disobedience]] who influenced later important political activists such as [[Martin Luther King]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]].
* [[Voltaire|François-Marie Arouet (Voltaire)]]: French Enlightenment writer, poet, and philosopher famous for his advocacy of civil liberties, including freedom of religion and free trade.
* [[Bernard Williams]]: A British moral philosopher whose posthumously published work on political philosophy ''In the Beginning was the Deed'' has been seen—along with the works of [[Raymond Geuss]]—as a key foundational work on political realism.
* [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]: A French political scientist and diplomat, known for his works ''[[Democracy in America]]'' and ''[[The Old Regime and the Revolution]]''.

'''Polycentric law''' is a legal structure in which providers of [[legal system]]s compete or overlap in a given [[jurisdiction]], as opposed to [[monopoly| monopolistic]] [[statutory law]] according to which there is a sole provider of [[law]] for each jurisdiction. [[Devolution]] of this monopoly occurs by the principle of jurisprudence in which they [[rule according to higher law]].

==Overview==
Tom W. Bell, former director of telecommunications and technology studies at [[Cato Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.cis.org.au/app/uploads/2015/04/images/stories/policy-magazine/1999-autumn/1999-15-1-tom-bell.pdf |title=Polycentric Law in the New Century |last=Bell |first=Tom |periodical=Policy Magazine |date=Autumn 1999 |publisher=[[Centre for Independent Studies]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201231229/http://www.cis.org.au/images/stories/policy-magazine/1999-autumn/1999-15-1-tom-bell.pdf |archive-date=2014-02-01 |accessdate=2018-10-20 |deadurl=no}} An [http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/policy-report/1998/11/polycentric-law-new-century.pdf earlier version] was published by the [[Cato Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt; now a professor of law at [[Chapman University School of Law]] in [[California]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chapman.edu/our-faculty/thomas-bell|title=Faculty Profile|website=www.chapman.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote "Polycentric Law", published by the [[Institute for Humane Studies]], when he was a law student at the [[University of Chicago]]. In it he notes that others use phrases such as "non-monopolistic law" to describe these polycentric alternatives.&lt;ref name="Bell1991"&gt;Tom W. Bell, [http://osf1.gmu.edu/~ihs/w91issues.html Polycentric Law], [[Institute for Humane Studies]] Review, Volume 7, Number 1 Winter 1991/92.&lt;/ref&gt; He outlines traditional [[customary law]] (also known as [[consuetudinary]] law) before the creation of [[State (polity)|states]], including as described by [[Friedrich A. Hayek]], [[Bruce L. Benson]], and [[David D. Friedman]]. He mentions [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[customary law]], [[Canon law|church law]], guild law, and [[law merchant| merchant law]] as examples of polycentric law. He notes that customary and statutory law have co-existed through history, as when [[Roman law]] applied to Romans throughout the [[Roman Empire]], but indigenous legal systems were permitted for non-Romans.&lt;ref name="Bell1991"/&gt; In "Polycentric Law in the New Millennium," which won first place in the [[Mont Pelerin Society]]'s 1998 Friedrich A. Hayek Fellowship competition, Bell predicts three areas where polycentric law might develop: alternative dispute resolution, private communities, and the Internet.

The [[University of Helsinki]] ([[Finland]]) funded a "Polycentric Law" research project from 1992 to 1995, led by professor Lars D. Eriksson. Its goal was to demonstrate "the inadequacy of current legal paradigms by mapping the indeterminacies of both the modern law and the modern legal theory. It also addressed the possibility of legal and ethical alternativies to the modern legal theories" and "provided openings to polycentric legal theories both by deconstructing the idea of unity in law and re-constructing legal and ethical differences". The project hosted two international conferences. In 1998 the book ''Polycentricity: The Multiple Scenes of Law'', edited by Ari Hirvonen, collected essays written by scholars involved with the project.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110720182508/http://savotta.helsinki.fi/halvi/keho/researce.nsf/504ca249c786e20f85256284006da7ab/4a21f65be414c8a4c2256769004fa548?OpenDocument Research project on polycentric law].&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[Randy Barnett]], who originally wrote about "non-monopolistic" law, later used the phrase "polycentric legal order". He explains the advantages of such a system in his book ''The Structure of Liberty: Justice and the Rule of Law.''&lt;ref&gt;Randy E. Barnett, [http://www.randybarnett.com E/TOC.htm ''The Structure of Liberty: Justice and the Rule of Law,''] Chapters 12 -14, [[Oxford University Press]], 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce L. Benson also uses the phrase, writing in a Cato Institute publication in 2007: "A customary system of polycentric law would appear to be much more likely to generate efficient sized jurisdictions for the various communities involved—perhaps many smaller than most nations, with others encompassing many of today’s political jurisdictions (e.g., as [[international commercial law]] does today)."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce L. Benson]], "[http://www.cato-unbound.org/2007/08/16/bruce-l-benson/polycentric-governance/ Polycentric Governance]", ''[[Cato Institute|Cato Unbound]]'', August 16th, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

John K. Palchak and Stanley T. Leung in "No State Required? A Critical Review of the Polycentric Legal Order," criticize the concept of polycentric law.&lt;ref&gt;John K. Palchak and Stanley T. Leung, "[http://blogs.gonzaga.edu/gulawreview/files/2011/02/PalchakLeung.pdf No State Required? A Critical Review of the Polycentric Legal Order]," 38 ''Gonzaga Law Review'', 289, (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal scholar [[Gary Chartier]] in "Anarchy and Legal Order" elaborates and defends the idea of law without the state. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/archives/2013/03/22/is-anarchism-socialist-or-capitalist|title=Is Anarchism Socialist or Capitalist?|date=22 March 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animated by a vision of peaceful, voluntary cooperation as a social ideal and building on a careful account of [[non-aggression]], the book seeks to explain why the state is illegitimate, dangerous, and unnecessary. It proposes an understanding of how law enforcement in a [[stateless society]] could be legitimate and what the optimal substance of law without the state might be, suggests ways in which a stateless legal order could foster the growth of a culture of freedom, and situates the project it elaborates in relation to [[leftist]], [[anti-capitalist]], and [[socialist]] traditions.

'''Private jurisdiction''' is the right of an individual or a [[Legal person|legal entity]] to establish [[Court|courts of law]]. It was prevalent during [[feudalism]].

A [[Exclusive right|franchise]], such as a [[corporation]], a jurisdiction, or a right to collect certain tolls or taxes, was, in effect, a kind of property: an "[[incorporeal hereditament]]". Under [[English law]] incorporeal hereditaments (including jurisdictions) were either granted or recognized in [[charter]]s. 

Franchise jurisdictions included those of [[manorial court]]s, secular courts of ecclesiastical corporations (in addition to the Church's own jurisdiction over [[family law]]), [[borough courts]] of [[municipal corporation]]s, merchant courts established on markets and fairs, and mining courts of mines and mining villages.

In medieval England franchises could also be established for jurisdiction over partially or entirely privatized administrative territories such as "[[Hundred (county subdivision)|hundreds]]" and [[county|counties]]. Broad jurisdictional powers were also granted to many colonial corporations (such as the [[East India Company]]). 

In medieval England for many substantive areas of law the king's courts only reviewed whether the franchise courts stayed within their jurisdictional and certain procedural bounds and not the substance of the case. Generally, the only way to remove or undo the remedy of a franchise court case in royal court was to bring one of several varieties of lawsuits for [[trespass]] ([[tort]]) against the franchise court.

'''Private law''' is that part of a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] [[legal system]] which is part of the ''[[jus commune]]'' that involves relationships between individuals, such as the law of [[contract]]s or [[tort]]s&lt;ref name="Mattei"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.common-core.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=46&amp;Itemid=34 |title=The Project - Delivered at the first general meeting on July 6, 1995 - The Trento Common Core Project |last=Mattei |first=Ugo|author2=Bussani, Mauro |date=18 May 2010|work=The Common Core of European Private Law|publisher=Common Core Organizing Secretariat, [[The International University College of Turin]] |accessdate=8 September 2011|location=Turin, Italy}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as it is called in the [[common law]]), and the [[law of obligations]] (as it is called in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil legal systems]]). It is to be distinguished from [[public law]], which deals with relationships between both [[natural person|natural]] and [[Juristic person|artificial persons]] (i.e., organizations) and the [[State (polity)|state]], including regulatory [[statute]]s, [[penal law]] and other law that affects the [[public order]]. In general terms, private law involves interactions between private citizens, whereas public law involves interrelations between the state and the general population.

==Private law in common law jurisdictions==
The concept of private law in common law countries is a little more broad, in that it also encompasses private relationships between governments and private individuals or other entities. That is, relationships between governments and individuals based on the law of contract or torts are governed by private law, and are not considered to be within the scope of public law.

'''Public opinion''' consists of the desires, wants, and thinking of the majority of the people; it is the collective opinion of the people of a society or state on an issue or problem.

This [[concept]] came about through the process of [[urbanization]] and other political and social forces. For the first time, it became important what people thought, as forms of political contention changed.

==Etymology==
The term ''public opinion'' was derived from the French ''opinion publique'' which was first used in 1588 by [[Michel de Montaigne]] in the second edition of his ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essays]]'' (ch. XXII).&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Braatz, ''Friedrich Nietzsche: Eine Studie zur Theorie der Öffentlichen Meinung'', Walter de Gruyter, 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French term also appears in the 1761 work ''[[Julie, or the New Heloise]]'' by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].&lt;ref&gt;The term ''opinion publique'' appears in the chapter: "Lettre XXIV à Julie" of the book.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Speier&gt;Hans Speier, "Historical Development of Public Opinion", ''American Journal of Sociology'', Vol. 55, No. 4 (Jan., 1950), pp. 376–388. {{doi|10.1086/220561}}. {{jstor|2772299}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Precursors of the phrase in English include [[Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet|William Temple]]'s "general opinion" (appearing in his 1672 work ''On the Original and Nature of Government'') and [[John Locke]]'s "law of opinion" (appearing in his 1689 work ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'').&lt;ref name=Speier/&gt;

==History==
The emergence of public opinion as a significant force in the political realm can be dated to the late 17th century. However, opinion had been regarded as having singular importance since far earlier. Medieval ''fama publica'' or ''vox et fama communis'' had great legal and social importance from the 12th and 13th centuries onward.&lt;ref&gt;See {{fr}} [http://books.openedition.org/pur/15839?lang=fr Julien Théry, "''Fama'' : l'opinion publique comme preuve judiciaire. Aperçu sur la révolution médiévale de l'inquisitoire (XIIe-XIVe s.)", in B. Lemesle (ed.), ''La preuve en justice de l'Antiquité à nos jours'', Rennes, PUR, 2003, pp. 119–147, available online], and Daniel Smail, Thelma Fernster (ed), Fama. ''The Politics of Talk and Reputation'', Ithaca, Cornell University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[William Shakespeare]] called public opinion the 'mistress of success' and [[Blaise Pascal]] thought it was 'the queen of the world.'

[[John Locke]] in his treatise ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' considered that man was subject to three laws: the [[divine law]], the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], and most importantly in Locke's judgement, the law of [[opinion]] or [[reputation]]. He regarded the latter as of the highest importance because dislike and ''ill opinion'' force people to conform in their behaviour to social norms, however he didn't consider public opinion as a suitable influence for governments.

[[Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet|William Temple]] in his essay of 1672, ''On the Original and Nature of Government'' gave an early formulation of the importance of public opinion. He observed that "...when vast numbers of men submit their lives and fortunes absolutely to the will of one, it...must be force of custom, or opinion...which subjects power to authority."

Temple disagreed with the prevalent opinion that the basis of government lay in a [[social contract]] and thought that government was merely allowed to exist due to the favour of public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Historical Development of Public Opinion|last=Speier|first=Hans|journal=[[American Journal of Sociology]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|issn=1537-5390|volume=55|issue=4|year=1950|pages=376–88|jstor=2772299|registration=y|doi=10.1086/220561|url=http://www.raco.cat/index.php/Analisi/article/download/15081/189532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prerequisites for the emergence of a public sphere were increasing levels of literacy which was spurred on by the [[Reformation]], which encouraged individuals to read the [[Bible]] in the vernacular, and the rapidly expanding printing presses. During the 18th century religious literature was replaced with secular literature, novels and pamphlets. In parallel to this was the growth in reading societies and clubs. At the turn of the century the first circulating library opened in London and the [[public library]] became widespread and available to the public.

===Coffee-houses===
[[File:17th century coffeehouse england 1-580x400.jpg|thumb|right|Coffeehouse in [[London]], 17th century]]
An institution of central importance in the development of public opinion, was the [[coffee-house]], which became widespread throughout Europe in the mid-17th century. Although [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] later tried to suppress the London coffeehouses as "places where the disaffected met, and spread scandalous reports concerning the conduct of His Majesty and his Ministers", the public flocked to them. For several decades following the Restoration, the [[Wit]]s gathered round [[John Dryden]] at [[Will's Coffee House]], in Russell Street, Covent Garden.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gk8OAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=%22places%20where%20the%20disaffected%20met%2C%20and%20spread%20scandalous%20reports%20concerning%20the%20conduct%20of%20His%20Majesty%20and%20his%20Ministers%22&amp;pg=PA531#v=onepage&amp;q=%22places%20where%20the%20disaffected%20met,%20and%20spread%20scandalous%20reports%20concerning%20the%20conduct%20of%20His%20Majesty%20and%20his%20Ministers%22&amp;f=false An historical and chronological deduction of the origin of commerce, from the earliest accounts. : Containing an history of the great commercial interests of the British Empire. To which is prefixed an introduction, exhibiting a view of the ancient and modern state of Europe ; of the importance of our colonies ; and of the commerce, shipping, manufactures, fisheries, &amp;c., of Great-Britain and Ireland ; and their influence on the landed interest. With an appendix, containing the modern politico-commercial geography of the several countries of Europe. Author:	Adam Anderson; William Combe; John Walter; Logographic Press.]&lt;/ref&gt; The coffee houses were great social levellers, open to all men and indifferent to social status, and as a result associated with equality and republicanism.

More generally, coffee houses became meeting places where business could be carried on, news exchanged and ''[[The London Gazette]]'' (government announcements) read. [[Lloyd's of London]] had its origins in a coffeehouse run by [[Edward Lloyd (coffeehouse owner)|Edward Lloyd]], where underwriters of ship insurance met to do business. By 1739, there were 551 coffeehouses in London; each attracted a particular clientele divided by occupation or attitude, such as [[Tory|Tories]] and [[Whig (British political faction)|Whigs]], wits and [[stockjobber]]s, merchants and lawyers, booksellers and authors, men of fashion or the "cits" of the [[City of London|old city center]]. [[Joseph Addison]] wanted to have it said of him that he had "brought philosophy out of closets and libraries to dwell in clubs and assemblies, at tea tables and in coffee houses." According to one French visitor, [[Antoine François Prévost]], coffeehouses, "where you have the right to read all the papers for and against the government," were the "seats of English liberty."&lt;ref&gt;Prévost, Abbé (1930) ''Adventures of a man of quality'' (translation of ''Séjour en Angleterre'', v. 5 of ''Mémoires et avantures d'un homme de qualité qui s'est retiré du monde'') G. Routledge &amp; Sons, London, {{OCLC|396693}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gentleman clubs===
[[File:Joseph Highmore - A Club of Gentlemen - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''A Club of Gentlemen'' by [[Joseph Highmore]] c. 1730.]]
[[Gentlemen's club]]s proliferated in the 18th century, especially in the [[West End of London]]. Clubs took over the role occupied by coffee houses in 18th century London to some degree, and reached the height of their influence in the late 19th century – some notable names were [[White's]], [[Brooks's]], [[Arthur's]], and [[Boodle's]] which still exist today.

These social changes, in which a closed and largely illiterate public became an open and politicized one, was to become of tremendous political importance in the 19th century as the mass media was circulated ever more widely and literacy was steadily improved. Governments increasingly recognized the importance of [[propaganda|managing and directing public opinion]]. This trend is exemplified in the career of [[George Canning]] who restyled his political career from its aristocratic origins to one of popular consent when he contested and won the parliamentary seat in [[Liverpool]]; a city with a growing and affluent middle class, which he attributed to the growing influence of "public opinion."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen M. Lee, "George Canning and Liberal Toryism, 1801–1827" Woodbridge: Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeremy Bentham]] was an impassioned advocate of the importance of public opinion in the shaping of constitutional governance. He thought it important that all government acts and decisions should be subject to the inspection of public opinion, because "to the pernicious exercise of the power of government it is the only check."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482436/public-opinion/258764/Public-opinion-and-government|title=public opinion}}&lt;/ref&gt; He opined that public opinion had the power to ensure that rulers would rule for the greatest happiness of the greater number. He brought in [[Utilitarianism|Utilitarian philosophy]] in order to define theories of public opinion.

==Concepts==

The German sociologist [[Ferdinand Tönnies]], by using the conceptional tools of his theory of [[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft]], argued (''Kritik der öffentlichen Meinung'', 1922), that 'public opinion' has the equivalent [[social function]] in societies (''Gesellschaften'') which [[religion]] has in communities (''Gemeinschaften'').&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Fechner/[[Lars Clausen]]/Arno Bammé (eds.): ''Öffentliche Meinung zwischen neuer Religion und neuer Wissenschaft. Ferdinand Tönnies' "Kritik der öffentlichen Meinung" in der internationalen Diskussion'', in: ''Tönnies im Gespräch'', tom. 3, Munich/Vienna: Profil 2005, {{ISBN|3-89019-590-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

German social theorist [[Jürgen Habermas]] contributed the idea of "[[Public sphere]]" to the discussion of public opinion. The Public Sphere, or bourgeois public, is according to Habermas, where "something approaching public opinion can be formed" (2004, p.&amp;nbsp;351). Habermas claimed that the Public Sphere featured universal access, rational debate, and disregard for rank. However, he believes that these three features for how public opinion are best formed are no longer in place in western [[Liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] countries. Public opinion, in western democracy, is highly susceptible to elite manipulation.

The American sociologist [[Herbert Blumer]] has proposed an altogether different conception of the "public". According to Blumer, public opinion is discussed as a form of [[collective behavior]] (another specialized term) which is made up of those who are discussing a given public issue at any one time. Given this definition, there are many publics; each of them comes into being when an issue arises and ceases to exist when the issue is resolved. Blumer claims that people participate in public in different capacities and to different degrees. So, public opinion polling cannot measure the public. An educated individual's participation is more important than that of a drunk. The "mass", in which people independently make decisions about, for example, which brand of toothpaste to buy, is a form of collective behavior different from the public.

Public opinion plays an important role in the political sphere. Cutting across all aspects of relationship between government and public opinion are studies of voting behavior. These have registered the distribution of opinions on a wide variety of issues, have explored the impact of special interest groups on election outcomes and have contributed to our knowledge about the effects of government propaganda and policy.

Contemporary, quantitative approaches to the study of public opinion may be divided into 4 categories:
# quantitative measurement of opinion distributions;
# investigation of the internal relationships among the individual opinions that make up public opinion on an issue;
# description or analysis of the public role of public opinion;
# study both of the communication media that disseminate the ideas on which opinions are based and of the uses that propagandists and other manipulators make of these media.

The rapid spread of public opinion measurement around the world is reflection of the number of uses to which it can be put. Public opinion can be accurately obtained through [[survey sampling]]. Both private firms and governments use [[opinion poll|surveys]] to inform public policies and public relations.

==Formation==
Numerous theories and substantial evidence exists to explain the formation and dynamics of individuals' opinions. Much of this research draws on psychological research on [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]]. In [[communications studies]] and [[political science]], [[mass media]] are often seen as influential forces on public opinion. Additionally, [[political socialization]] and [[behavioral genetics]] sometimes explain public opinion.

===Mass media effects===
The formation of public opinion starts with [[Agenda-setting theory|agenda setting]] by major media outlets throughout the world. This agenda setting dictates what is newsworthy and how and when it will be reported. The media agenda is set by a variety of different environmental and newswork factors that determines which stories will be newsworthy.

Another key component in the formation of public opinion is [[Framing (social sciences)|framing]]. Framing is when a story or piece of news is portrayed in a particular way and is meant to sway the consumers attitude one way or the other. Most political issues are heavily framed in order to persuade voters to vote for a particular candidate. For example, if Candidate X once voted on a bill that raised income taxes on the middle class, a framing headline would read "Candidate X Doesn't Care About the Middle Class". This puts Candidate X in a negative frame to the news reader.

[[Social desirability]] is another key component to the formation of public opinion. Social desirability is the idea that people in general will form their opinions based on what they believe is the prevalent opinion of the social group they identify with. Based on media agenda setting and media framing, most often a particular opinion gets repeated throughout various news mediums and [[social network]]ing sites, until it creates a false vision where the perceived truth can actually be very far away from the actual truth.

Public opinion can be influenced by [[public relations]] and the [[political media]]. Additionally, [[mass media]] utilizes a wide variety of [[advertising]] techniques to get their message out and change the minds of people. Since the 1950s, [[television]] has been the main [[mass media|medium]] for molding public opinion.&lt;ref name="Diggs-Brown2011p53"&gt;Diggs-Brown, Barbara (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=7c0ycySng4YC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53 ''Strategic Public Relations: Audience Focused Practice''] p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of influentials==
{{see also|Two-step flow of communication}}
There have been a variety of academic studies investigating whether or not public opinion is influenced by "[[Social influence|influentials]]," or persons that have a significant effect on influencing opinion of the general public regarding any relevant issues.  Many early studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elihu Katz and Paul Felix Lazarsfeld|title=Personal Influence: the Part Played by People in the Flow of Mass Communications|year=1955|isbn=1-4128-0507-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lazarsfeld et al., 1968&lt;/ref&gt; have modeled the transfer of information from [[mass media]] sources to the general public as a "two-step" process.  In this process, information from mass media and other far-reaching sources of information influences influentials, and influentials then influence the general public as opposed to the mass media directly influencing the public.

While the "two-step" process regarding public opinion influence has motivated further research on the role of influential persons, a more recent study by Watts and Dodds (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Watts, D.J. and P.S. Dodds|year=2007|title=Influentials, Networks, and Public Opinion Formation|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=34|issue=4|pages=441–458|url=https://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/research/papers/others/2007/watts2007a.pdf|doi=10.1086/518527}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that while influentials play some role in influencing public opinion, "non-influential" persons that make up the general public are also just as likely (if not more likely) to influence opinion provided that the general public is composed of persons that are easily influenced.  This is referred to in their work as the "Influential Hypothesis."  The authors discuss such results by using a model to quantify the number of people influenced by both the general public and influentials.  The model can be easily customized to represent a variety of ways that influencers interact with each other as well as the general public.  In their study, such a model diverges from the prior paradigm of the "two-step" process.  The Watts and Dodds model introduces a model of influence emphasizing lateral channels of influence between the influencers and general public categories.  This thus leads to a more complex flow of influence amongst the three parties involved in influencing public opinion (i.e., media, influencers and general public).

==Relationship with public policy==
The most pervasive issue dividing theories of the opinion-policy relation bears a striking resemblance to the problem of [[monism]]-[[pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]] in the history of philosophy. The controversy deals with the question of whether the structure of [[socio-political]] action should be viewed as a more or less centralized process of acts and decisions by a class of key leaders, representing integrated hierarchies of influence in society or whether it is more accurately envisaged as several sets of relatively autonomous opinion and influence groups, interacting with representative [[decision maker]]s in an official structure of differentiated [[governmental authority]]. The former assumption interprets individual, group and official action as part of a single system and reduces politics and governmental policies to a derivative of three basic analytical terms: society, culture and [[personality]].

Despite philosophical arguments regarding public opinion, social scientists (those in [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[economics]] and [[social psychology]]) present compelling theories to describe how public opinion shapes public policy and find myriad effects of opinion on policy using various empirical research methods. Moreover, researchers find that causal relationships likely run in both directions from opinion to policy and from policy to opinion. On the one hand, public opinion signals public preferences and potential voting behaviors to policymakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pierson|first1=Paul|title=Coping with Permanent Austerity: Welfare State Restructuring in Affluent Democracies|journal=Revue Française de Sociologie|date=2002|volume=43|issue=2|pages=369–406|jstor=3322510|doi=10.2307/3322510}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Soroka|first1=Stuart|last2=Wlezien|first2=Christopher|title=Degrees of Democracy: Politics, Public Opinion and Policy|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; This impact should be greater under more stable democratic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Papadakis|first1=Elim|title=Public Opinion, Public Policy and the Welfare State|journal=Political Studies|date=1992|volume=40|issue=1|pages=21–37|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9248.1992.tb01758.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be greatest in the realm of social policy because the public are highly motivated by potential goods and services they get from the state. On the other hand, social policy impacts public opinion. The goods and services the public gets via social policy builds normative expectations that shape public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mau|first1=Steffen|title=Welfare Regimes and the Norms of Social Exchange|journal=Current Sociology|date=2004|volume=52|issue=1|pages=53–74|doi=10.1177/0011392104039314}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Oorschot|first1=Wim|title=Culture and Social Policy: A Developing Field of Study|journal=International Journal of Social Welfare|date=2007|volume=16|issue=2|pages=129–139|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2397.2006.00451.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plus, social policy constitutes the largest share of state spending budgets, making it an active and contentious political area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Expenditures Database|url=https://www.oecd.org/social/expenditure.htm|publisher=OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together these theories suggest that causal effects are part of a feedback loop between opinion and policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=Andrea Louise|title=Policy Makes Mass Politics|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|date=2012|volume=15|issue=1|pages=333–351|doi=10.1146/annurev-polisci-012610-135202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wlezien|first1=Christopher|last2=Soroka|first2=Stuart|title=Relationships between Public Opinion and Policy|journal=Oxford Handbook of Political Behavior|date=2007|pages=799–817|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199270125.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199270125-e-043?mediaType=Article}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shapiro|first1=Robert|title=Public Opinion and American Democracy|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|date=2011|volume=75|issue=5|pages=982–1017|doi=10.1093/poq/nfr053}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using increasingly sophisticated methods, scholars are beginning to grasp and identify the feedback of opinion and policy and use this phenomenon to explain the path dependency of institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Breznau|first1=Nate|title=Positive Returns and Equilibrium: Simultaneous Feedback Between Public Opinion and Social Policy|journal=Policy Studies Journal|date=14 July 2016|doi=10.1111/psj.12171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wlezien|first1=Christopher|title=The Public as Thermostat: Dynamics of Preferences for Spending|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=1995|volume=39|issue=4|pages=981–1000|jstor=2111666|doi=10.2307/2111666}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pierson|first1=Paul|title=Increasing Returns, Path Dependence, and the Study of Politics|journal=The American Political Science Review|date=2000|volume=94|issue=2|pages=251–267|jstor=2586011|doi=10.2307/2586011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with foreign policy==
As with public policy, public opinion also has a close relationship with [[foreign policy]]. There is much debate concerning what the relationship is, and the study of foreign policy's relationship with public opinion has evolved over time, with the Almond-Lippmann Consensus being one of the first attempt to define this relationship. Published before the Vietnam War, Almond and Lippmann argued that public opinion about foreign policy was unstructured, incoherent, and highly volatile, and that public opinion shouldn't influence foreign policy.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;Holsti, Ole R. "Public Opinion and Foreign Policy: Challenges to the Almond-Lippmann Consensus Mershon Series: Research Programs and Debates." International Studies Quarterly, vol. 36, no. 4, 1992, pp. 439–466. {{jstor|2600734}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies have rebuked the Almond-Lippmann Consensus, showing how people's opinions are generally stable, and that while individuals may not be entirely informed about every issue, they still act efficiently and rationally.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew A. Baum and Philip B. K. Potter, "The Relationships Between Mass Media, Public Opinion, and Foreign Policy: Toward a Theoretical Synthesis," ''Annual Review of Political Science'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

People’s judgments about issues are often based on heuristics, which are mental shortcuts that allow rational decisions to be made quickly. [[Heuristics]] apply to public opinion about domestic as well as foreign policy. The deductive heuristic is one that relies on a person's core values and social groups. Delegative heuristics are influenced by figures of authority such as the media or president.&lt;ref&gt;Sniderman, Paul. Reasoning and Choice. ''Explorations in Political Psychology''&lt;/ref&gt;

Another key theory about how people form their opinions on foreign policy issues is Hurwitz and Peffley's hierarchical attitudes model. They argue that it is structured, with core values providing the basis for postures which further influence the ultimate issue position.&lt;ref&gt;Hurwitz, Jon, and Mark Peffley. "How Are Foreign Policy Attitudes Structured? A Hierarchical Model." The American Political Science Review, vol. 81, no. 4, 1987, pp. 1099–1120. {{jstor|1962580}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public opinion about foreign policy is measured in the same way that all public opinion is measured. Through [[Opinion poll|polls]] and surveys, respondents are asked about their issue positions. Conclusions are drawn by researchers by applying the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/12/methods-101-random-sampling/ pewresearch.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with U.S. Presidency==
According to Robert Shapiro, public opinion and policy-making are fundamental to a democracy, which is linked to electoral accountability, meaning that the leader who was elected "will not deviate far from voters’ opinion".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A problem that arises when analyzing the data collected by researchers is how these issues that are "important" are selected when collecting the data about public opinion. It is hard to determine if there has been underdevelopment of certain issues. Another concern is how elites influence public opinion by persuasion and rhetoric, ultimately shaping policy-making. These two variables are ambiguous by nature and are hard to get to any conclusions, in most cases beyond the limits of research. Other variables to look at when analyzing the opinion-policy effect are the size of the majority public, election cycle time, degree of electoral competition, and the type of issue. For example, domestic affairs public opinion will be of greater importance than that of foreign affairs, because of the complexity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shapiro|first1=Robert|date=2011|title=Public Opinion and American Democracy|url=https://academic.oup.com/poq/article-abstract/75/5/982/1826441|journal=The Public Opinion Quarterly|volume=75|issue=5|pages=982–1017|doi=10.1093/poq/nfr053|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since presidents have the ability to influence their political agenda, it is easier for them to respond to public opinion. Also, since they are not an institution (like Congress) they can "shift the standards by which the public evaluates their performance in office – away from policy concerns and towards more symbolic activities, image, and personality."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A study by James N. Druckman and Lawrence R. Jacobs discusses how presidents collect their information for policymaking. They found that on one hand, they collect data about the public's preference on salient matters like crime and economy. This reflects a populist type of democracy where the government portrays respect toward the people's views and they are connected. On the other hand, government institutions and elites believe the general populations’ understanding of certain issued is limited, therefore they exercise autonomy when making these decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Druckman|first1=J.N.|date=2009|title=Presidential Responsiveness to public opinion|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238859.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199238859-e-8|journal=The Oxford Handbook of American Presidency|volume=|page=454|pages=|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238859.003.0008|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Baum and Kernell have stated that a challenge that modern presidents face when trying to persuade public opinion is that there is so many different types of media, that getting people's attention is hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baum and Kernell|first1=M.A., S|title=Has Cable Ended the Golden Age of Presidential Television?|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=93|pages=99–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; New media alternatives has also caused on effect on Presidential leadership as they now use them to be able to communicate younger generations, but targeting small groups of people.

{{Conflict of laws}}
In [[Conflict of laws|private international law]], the '''public policy doctrine''' or '''{{lang|fr|ordre public}}''' (French: lit. "public order") concerns the body of principles that underpin the operation of legal systems in each [[Jurisdiction (area)|state]]. This addresses the social, moral and economic values that tie a [[society]] together: values that vary in different [[culture]]s and change over time. [[Law]] regulates behaviour either to reinforce existing social expectations or to encourage constructive change, and laws are most likely to be effective when they are consistent with the most generally accepted societal norms and reflect the collective [[morality]] of the [[society]].

In performing this function, Cappalli{{who?|date=November 2018}} has suggested that the critical values of any legal system include impartiality, neutrality, certainty, equality, openness, flexibility, and growth. This assumes that a state's courts function as ''[[dispute resolution]] systems'', which avoid the violence that often otherwise accompanies private resolution of disputes.  That is, [[citizen]]s have to be encouraged to use the [[Judiciary|court system]] to resolve their disputes. The more certain and predictable the outcome of a court action, the less incentive there is to go to court where a loss is probable. But certainty must be subject to the needs of individual [[justice]], hence the development of [[Equity (law)|equity]].

A [[judge]] should always consider the underlying policies to determine whether a rule should be applied to a specific factual dispute. If laws are applied too strictly and mechanically, the law cannot keep pace with social innovation. Similarly, if there is an entirely new situation, a return to the policies forming the basic assumptions underpinning potentially relevant rules of law identifies the best guidelines for resolving the immediate dispute. Over time, these policies evolve, becoming more clearly defined and more deeply embedded in the legal system.

== Fundamental principles ==
=== Ignorance of the law is not an excuse ===
The fundamental policy in the operation of a legal system is that ''[[ignorantia juris non excusat]]'' (''ignorance of the law is no excuse''). It would completely undermine the enforcement of any law if the person potentially at fault was able to raise as a successful defence that he or she had not been aware of the particular law. For this reason, all the main [[legislature]]s publish their laws freely whether in hard copy or on the [[Internet]], while others offer them for sale to the public at affordable prices. Because everyone is entitled to access the laws as they affect their personal lives, all adults are assumed responsible enough to research the law before they act. If they fail to do so, they can hardly complain if their acts prove unlawful, no matter how transiently they may be within the [[jurisdiction]]. The only exception to this rule excuses those of reduced [[capacity (law)|capacity]], whether as [[minor (law)|infants]] or through mental illness (for example, see the principle of ''[[doli incapax]]'' which raises an irrebuttable presumption in [[criminal law]] that an infant is incapable of committing a crime).

=== Sanctity of life ===
Underpinning most social, moral and religious systems is the policy of ''sanctity of life'' (also [[culture of life]]). In English criminal law, for example, [[duress]] is not allowed as a defence to [[murder]] because no threat is supposed to overcome a person's moral aversion to taking the life of another. Lord Jauncy in ''R v Gotts'' [1992]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lawteacher.net/cases/r-v-gotts.php&lt;/ref&gt; 2 AC 412 stated:

{{quote|The reason why duress has for so long been stated not to be available as a defence to a murder charge is that the law regards the sanctity of human life and the protection thereof as of paramount importance ... I can therefore see no justification in logic, morality or law in affording to an attempted murderer the defence which is withheld from a murderer.}}

In refusal of treatment and [[euthanasia]], commission and [[omission (criminal law)|omission]] by [[Physician|doctors]] and [[hospital]] authorities resulting in the death of [[patient]]s has become of increasing significance as societies debate whether the duty to preserve life outweighs the right of the autonomous patient to choose death. More contentious are those situations in which the patient is unable to make the choice personally, e.g. because in a [[persistent vegetative state]] or ''[[en ventre sa mere]]'', i.e. a child in the womb.

=== Doctrine of evasion ===
Similarly, in many branches of law, the [[Evasion (law)|doctrine of evasion]] prevents persons, both natural and artificial, from evading the application of obligations and liabilities already attaching to them. This represents a practical application of the policy that, as an outcome of the [[social contract]], all persons owing [[allegiance]] to a state should be entitled to assume that everyone will receive fair and equal treatment before the law, i.e. there will be no favouritism or preferential treatment to any person by virtue of their [[social rank|rank]] or [[social status|status]] within [[society]]. As such, this is an exception to the policy in the [[Contract|law of contract]] which usually allows the parties autonomy to enter into whatever agreement they want and which might otherwise be taken to permit the parties to exclude the normal operation of the law as between themselves (see the policy of [[freedom of contract]]).

=== Children ===
There are policies specific to all the main branches of law. Hence, one of the policies in [[family law]] is ''[[parens patriae]]'', i.e. that the state is the default [[parent]] for all those [[child]]ren within its [[jurisdiction]] and that, if it is necessary to protect the interests of the child, the state will usurp the rights of the natural parents and assert its own rights as every child's [[legal guardian]]. Within the [[European Union|EU]], the right of the child to be heard in any proceedings is a fundamental right provided in Article 24 [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]]. The views of the child shall be considered on matters which concern him or her in accordance with age and maturity. It also provides that the child's [[best interest]] shall be the primary consideration in all actions relating to children, whether taken by public authorities or private institutions.

=== Marriage ===
A policy which overlaps between family law and [[contract law]] is ''[[favor matrimonii]]'' which requires that any marriage entered into with a genuine commitment should be held valid unless there is some good reason to the contrary, matching contract law, where the preference is always to give effect to the genuine expectation of the parties.

== Discussion ==
{{Politics|expanded=Policy}}
The policies adopted by states have come into being for several reasons. Some are aspects of the concept of [[sovereignty]] and reflect the essence of territoriality. Thus, [[public law]]s which either define the [[constitution]] of the state or regulate its powers can only apply within the boundaries agreed as a part of the process of ''[[de jure]]'' recognition of statehood by the international community. Other policies are aspects of the social contract, and they define and regulate the relationship between a state and those [[citizens]] who owe it allegiance. To that extent, these policies interact with (and sometimes overlap) [[civil rights]] and [[human rights]]. A number of these rights are defined at a [[supranationalism|supranational]] level and it will necessary for states to consider the extent to which international principles of law are to be allowed to influence the operation of law within their territories. Independently of the work of the international community to produce harmonised principles, the [[court]]s in one state may sometimes be faced with [[lawsuits]] which either seek to evade the operation of foreign laws through [[forum shopping]] or seek the enforcement of "foreign" laws. This is becoming increasingly common as people now move with reasonable freedom between states and international trade routinely services markets in different states. Such lawsuits will not be troublesome if the "foreign" law is the same as the forum law. But serious difficulties will arise if the application of the "foreign" law would produce a different result. These issues are resolved under the systems of law known as "[[conflict of laws]]".

In conflict cases, no court will apply a "foreign" law if the result of its application would be contrary to public policy. This is problematic because excluding the application of foreign laws would defeat the purpose of conflict of laws by giving automatic preference to the forum court's domestic law. Thus, for the most part, courts are slower to invoke public policy in cases involving a foreign element than when a domestic legal issue is involved. That said, in those countries that have adopted [[treaty]] obligations involving [[human rights]] (e.g. the states who submit to jurisdiction of the [[European Court of Human Rights]]) broader concepts of public policy may now apply. Thus, courts may have to consider the "justice" implicit in a law that allows a husband to divorce his wife, but not ''vice versa'', as an aspect of [[sexual discrimination]]. Similarly, it would be possible to question the propriety of [[polygamy|polygamous]] marriages, the ''[[Talaq (conflict)|talaq]]'' system of [[divorce]] which is available in some Islamic states, and Jewish divorce known as the ''[[get (conflict)|get]]'', but it is likely that the courts would be cautious to avoid any implication that they were discriminating against religions. Equally difficult are the family laws which regulate [[incest]]uous relationships and [[capacity (law)|capacity]]. For example, it is probable that one state should not be too quick to condemn another because it allows a [[marriage]] between an uncle and a niece, or allows a marriage with a girl of 13 (e.g. as in Northern Nigeria), particularly if the parties are not proposing residence in the forum state.

Less controversial is the exclusion of foreign laws that are [[Penal law|penal]] or territorial because they seek to collect taxes due to another state, e.g. in [[English law]], if foreign exchange control legislation is used as "an instrument of oppression", it may be denied extraterritorial enforcement (''Re Helbert Wagg &amp; Co Ltd'' [1956] Ch 323, 351). Similarly, otherwise valid contracts may be denied enforcement if to do so would assist an enemy of the forum state or would damage the political relationship with a friendly state. When considering questions of [[status (law)|status]], English courts have held that incapacities imposed on account of [[slavery]] (''[[Somerset v Stewart|Somersett's Case]]'' [1771] 20 St Tr 1), [[religion]] (''Re Metcalfe's Trusts'' [1864] 2 De G J &amp; S 122), alien [[nationality]] (''Re Helbert Wagg &amp; Co Ltd'' [1956] Ch 323 at pp.&amp;nbsp;345/46), [[race (classification of human beings)|race]] (''[[Oppenheimer v Cattermole]]'' [1976] A C 249 at pp.&amp;nbsp;265, 276/78, 282/83), divorce (''Scott v Attorney-General'' [1886] 11 PD 128), physical incompetence (''Re Langley's Settlement Trusts'' [1962] Ch 541 at pp.&amp;nbsp;556/57) and [[spendthrift|prodigality]] (''Worms v De Valdor'' [1880] 49L J Ch. 261 and ''Re Selot's Trusts'' [1902] 1 Ch. 488) will be disregarded. Policy is also a key component to the process for the [[enforcement of foreign judgments]].

'''Sexual and reproductive health and rights''' or ''SRHR'' is an  of [[human rights]] applied to [[sexuality]] and [[reproduction]]. It is a combination of four fields that in some contexts are more or less distinct from each other, but less so or not at all in other contexts. These four fields are [[sexual health]], [[Universal Declaration of Sexual Rights|sexual rights]], [[reproductive health]] and [[reproductive rights]]. In the concept of SRHR, these four fields are treated as separate but inherently intertwined.

Distinctions between these four fields are not always made. Sexual health and reproductive health are sometimes treated as synonymous to each other, as are sexual rights and reproductive rights. In some cases, sexual rights are included in the term sexual health, or vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ippf.org/resource/IPPF-Charter-Sexual-and-Reproductive-Rights|title=IPPF Charter on Sexual and Reproductive Rights Guidelines | date = 22 November 2011 | publisher= IPPF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only do different [[non-governmental organisation]]s (NGOs) and governments{{cn|date=May 2018}} use different terminologies, but different terminologies are often used within the same organization.

Some of the notable global NGOs that fight for sexual and reproductive health and rights include [[International Planned Parenthood Federation|IPPF]] (International Planned Parenthood Federation), [[ILGA]] (International Lesbian and Gay Alliance), WAS ([[World Association for Sexual Health]] - formerly known as World Association for Sexology), and International HIV/AIDS Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aidsalliance.org/TechnicalThemeDetails.aspx?Id=10 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131206105333/http://www.aidsalliance.org/TechnicalThemeDetails.aspx?Id=10 | archive-date = 6 December 2013 | dead-url = yes | title = SRHR and HIV | publisher = International HIV/AIDS Alliance | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurongos.org/Default.aspx?ID=1495 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110616041715/http://www.eurongos.org/Default.aspx?ID=1495 | archive-date = 16 June 2011 | dead-url = yes | title = Members of EuroNGOs | publisher = EuroNGOs | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual health==
The [[World Health Organization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/sexual_health/en/|title=Sexual health|website=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines sexual health as: "Sexual health is a state of physical, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality. It requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence."

Unlike the other three aspects of SRHR, the struggle for sexual rights include, and focus on, sexual pleasure and emotional sexual expression. One platform for this struggle is the [[World Association for Sexual Health|WAS]] Declaration of Sexual Rights.

The Platform for Action from the [[1995 Beijing Conference on Women]] established that human rights include the right of women freely and without coercion, violence or discrimination, to have control over and make decisions concerning their own sexuality, including their own sexual and reproductive health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/platform/ | title = Beijing Platform for Action, paragraphs 92, 93 and 96 | publisher = United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women | date = September 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This paragraph has been interpreted by some countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Sweden's international policy on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights" | url = http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/574/a/61489 | website = www.regeringen.se | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140509001157/http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/574/a/61489 | archivedate = 2014-05-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the applicable definition of women’s sexual rights. The UN Commission on Human Rights has established that if women had more power, their ability to protect themselves against violence would be strengthened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Human Rights Resolution E/CN.4/RES/2005/84: The protection of human rights in the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) | url = http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/CHR/resolutions/E-CN_4-RES-2005-84.doc | date = 21 April 2005 | author = The Commission on Human Rights | publisher = The United Nations  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = 20 April 2005 | title = Human Rights Resolution E/CN.4/RES/2005/41: Elimination of violence against women | url = http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/CHR/resolutions/E-CN_4-RES-2005-41.doc | author = The Commission on Human Rights | publisher = The United Nations }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 14th World Congress of Sexology (Hong Kong, 1999), the WAS adopted the [[Declaration of Sexual Rights]], which originally included 11 sexual rights. It was heavily revised and expanded in March 2014 by the WAS Advisory Council to include 16 sexual rights:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsexology.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/declaration_of_sexual_rights_sep03_2014.pdf |title=Declaration of sexual rights' |publisher=Worldsexology.org |date=2014-03-01 |access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This Declaration influenced [[The Yogyakarta Principles]] (which were launched as a set of international principles relating to sexual orientation and gender identity on 26 March 2007), especially on the idea of each person's [[integrity]], and right to sexual and [[reproductive health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://yogyakartaprinciples.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/A5_yogyakartaWEB-2.pdf | title = The Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity | work = Yogyakartaprinciples.org | date = 10 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the U.S. government said it would begin using the term "sexual rights" in discussions of human rights and global development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/us-government-says-it-will-now-use-the-term-sexual-rights/ar-AAer3sZ?li=AAa0dzB&amp;ocid=HPCDHP |title=US government says it will now use the term 'sexual rights' |publisher=Msn.com |date=2015-06-26 |access-date=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproductive health==
{{Main article|Reproductive health}}
Within the framework of the [[World Health Organization]]'s (WHO) definition of [[health]] as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, '''reproductive health''', or '''sexual health'''/'''hygiene''', addresses the reproductive processes, functions and system at all stages of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/reproductive_health/en/|title=WHO: Reproductive health|access-date=2008-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reproductive health, therefore, implies that people are able to have a responsible, satisfying and [[Safer sex|safer sex life]] and that they have the capability to reproduce and the [[Family planning|freedom to decide]] if, when and how often to do so. One interpretation of this implies that men and women ought to be [[sex education|informed]] of and to have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of [[birth control]]; also access to appropriate [[reproductive medicine|health care services]] of [[sexual medicine|sexual]], [[reproductive medicine]] and implementation of health education programs to stress the importance of [[maternal health|women to go safely]] through [[pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]] could provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant. On the other hand, individuals do face inequalities in reproductive health services. Inequalities vary based on socioeconomic status, education level, age, ethnicity, religion, and resources available in their environment. It is possible for example, that low income individuals lack the resources for appropriate health services and the knowledge to know what is appropriate for maintaining reproductive health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hall KS, Moreau C, Trussell J | title = Determinants of and disparities in reproductive health service use among adolescent and young adult women in the United States, 2002-2008 | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 102 | issue = 2 | pages = 359–67 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22390451 | pmc = 3483992 | doi = 10.2105/ajph.2011.300380 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproductive Rights==
{{Main article|Reproductive rights}}
'''Reproductive rights''' are [[legal right]]s and freedoms relating to [[human reproduction|reproduction]] and [[reproductive health]].&lt;ref name="Cook_1996"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cook | first1 = Rebecca J. | last2 = Fathalla | first2 = Mahmoud F. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Advancing Reproductive Rights Beyond Cairo and Beijing|journal=International Family Planning Perspectives | date = September 1996 | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 115 | doi = 10.2307/2950752 | jstor = 2950752 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] defines reproductive rights as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Reproductive rights rest on the recognition of the basic right of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children and to have the information and means to do so, and the right to attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health. They also include the right of all to make decisions concerning reproduction free of [[discrimination]], [[coercion]] and [[violence]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://who.int/reproductive-health/gender/index.html|title=Sexual and reproductive health | publisher = World Health Organization }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Goals and objectives ==
Despite frequent changes to frameworks, overall goals for SRHR remain little changed. As first stipulated at the ICPD, universal reproductive health care remains the ultimate objective, and with each new framework, targets are developed to progress towards this.&lt;ref name="Tangcharoensathien_2015" /&gt; In the original ICPD Program of Action, the primary call was for universal access to healthcare, including reproductive healthcare, family planning and sexual health.&lt;ref name="Fincher_1994" /&gt; Over time, these have expanded to include the right to access education regarding sexual and reproductive health, an end to [[female genital mutilation]], and increased women's empowerment in social, political, and cultural spheres.&lt;ref name="Glasier_2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fincher_1994" /&gt;

Special goals and targets were also created to address adolescent sexual and reproductive health needs. Adolescents are often the most vulnerable to risks associated with sexual activity, including HIV, due to personal and social issues such as feelings of isolation, child marriage, and stigmatization.&lt;ref name="Hindin_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hindin MJ, Fatusi AO | title = Adolescent sexual and reproductive health in developing countries: an overview of trends and interventions | journal = International Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 58–62 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19620089 | doi = 10.1363/ipsrh.35.058.09 | jstor = 40233805 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments realized the importance of investing in the health of adolescents as a means of establishing future well-being for their societies.&lt;ref name="Chandra-Mouli_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chandra-Mouli V, Svanemyr J, Amin A, Fogstad H, Say L, Girard F, Temmerman M | title = Twenty years after International Conference on Population and Development: where are we with adolescent sexual and reproductive health and rights? | language = English | journal = The Journal of Adolescent Health | volume = 56 | issue = 1 Suppl | pages = S1-6 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25528975 | doi = 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2014.09.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the [[Commission on Population and Development]] developed a series of fundamental rights for adolescents including the right to comprehensive sex education, the right to decide all matters related to their sexuality, and access to sexual and reproductive health services without discrimination (including safe abortions wherever legal).&lt;ref name="Chandra-Mouli_2015" /&gt;

'''''The Sri Lanka Gazette''''', officially '''''The Gazette of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka''', ''({{lang-si|ශ්‍රී ලංකා ප්‍රජාතාන්ත්‍රික සමාජවාදී ජනරජයේ ගැසට් පත්‍රය|translit=Shrī Laṁkā Prajātāntrika Samājavādī Janarajayē Gæsaṭ Patraya|}}; {{lang-ta|இலங்கை ஜனநாயக சோசலிச குடியரசின் வர்த்தமானி|translit=Ilaṅkai Jaṉanāyaka Cōcalica Kuṭiyaraciṉ Varttamāṉi}}) is a [[public journal]] of the Government of [[Sri Lanka]]. It prints certain statutory notices from the government. Modeled after the ''[[London Gazette|Oxford Gazette]]'', the ''Sri Lanka Gazette'' is the oldest surviving newspaper in Sri Lanka, having been published continuously since 1802.&lt;ref name="priu"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/Current_Affairs/ca200203/20020315sri_lanka_gazette.htm | title=Sri Lanka Gazette celebrates 200 years today | publisher=[[Presidential Secretariat|Presidential Secretariat of Sri Lanka]] | date=15 March 2002 | accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.natlib.lk/mow/ | title=Sri Lanka Memory of the World National Committee&amp;nbsp;– Introduction | publisher=Sri Lanka Memory of the World National Committee. | accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lake"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lakehouse.lk/main/about-us/History.htm | title=Inception of Lake House | publisher=[[Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited]] | accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pressreference.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pressreference.com/Sa-Sw/Sri-Lanka.html | title=Sri Lanka | publisher=pressreference.com | accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:The Ceylon Government Gazette front page.jpg|thumb|upright|Front page of ''The Ceylon Government Gazette'' first issue on 15 March 1802.]]
The British captured some of the coastal areas of Sri Lanka in 1796.&lt;ref name="kmds"&gt;{{Cite book| last = De Silva | first = K.  M. | title = A history of Sri Lanka| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dByI_qil26YC | publisher = [[University of California Press]] | year = 1981 | pages = 234–235 | isbn = 978-0-520-04320-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1802, they launched ''The Ceylon Government Gazette'' to publish British government notices in the areas under their control. This was one of the series of papers launched by the British in their crown colonies, including ''Calcutta Gazette'' (1784), ''St. Lucia Gazette'' (1780), ''Cape Town Gazette'' and ''African Advertiser'' (1800) etc.&lt;ref name="black"&gt;{{cite book | title=Europe and the World, 1650–1830 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sCUqI_vPX0gC | publisher=[[Routledge]] | author=Black, Jeremy | authorlink=Jeremy Black (historian) | year=2002 | location=[[United Kingdom]] | page=98 | isbn=978-041-5255-69-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first issue of the ''Ceylon Gazette'' appeared on 15 March 1802.&lt;ref name="sundt1"/&gt;
It was printed by Frans de Bruin at the renovated press built in 1737 by the Dutch, who controlled the [[Dutch Ceylon|coastal areas of the island]] until 1796.&lt;ref name="sundat3"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sundaytimes.lk/060312/funday/3.html | title=It happened in March: Weekly news in the Government Gazette | publisher=[[The Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)|The Sunday Times]] | date=12 March 2006 | accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sundat2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sundaytimes.lk/020310/plusm.html | title=Rolling out the words | publisher=[[The Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)|The Sunday Times]] | date=10 March 2002 | accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A [[Tamil language|Tamil]] version of the ''Gazette'' was started in 1806, and a [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] version in 1814.&lt;ref name="priu"/&gt;

In 1972  the Sri Lankan government of [[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]] adopted a new Sri Lankan constitution and repudiated [[Dominion of Ceylon|Dominion status]].
The paper ceased publication that year after issue 15,011. Publication started again after adoption of the 1978 constitution by the [[Junius Richard Jayewardene|J. R. Jayewardene]] government.&lt;ref name="priu"/&gt; In 2011, the Sri Lankan government announced that it would revoke a ''Gazette'' notification by the British government dating back to 1818, which named and shamed the key conspirators of the [[Great Rebellion of 1817–1818]], the first struggle by Ceylonese to gain [[Sri Lankan independence movement|independence from Britain]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sinhala/news/story/2011/03/110312_brownrigg.shtml | title=Colonial gazette notification to be revoked | work=[[BBC]] | date=12 March 2011 | accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
The ''Gazette'' is published in Sinhalese, Tamil, and English which are three official languages of Sri Lanka. It publishes [[promulgation|promulgated]] bills, [[President of Sri Lanka|presidential]] decrees, governmental ordinances, major legal acts as well as vacancies, government exams, [[Request for tender|requests for tender]], changes of names, company registrations and deregistrations, land restitution notices, liquor licence applications, transport permits and auctions announced by various government departments.

'''Wex''' is a collaboratively built, freely available [[legal dictionary]] and encyclopedia.

Wex is an initiative to construct a collaboratively-created, public-access law dictionary and encyclopedia. It is sponsored and hosted by the [[Legal Information Institute]] ("LII") at the [[Cornell Law School]]. Much of the material that appears in Wex was originally developed for the LII's "Law about..." pages, to which Wex is the successor.

Wex accepts contributions from qualified experts. It screens editors before allowing them to contribute.
