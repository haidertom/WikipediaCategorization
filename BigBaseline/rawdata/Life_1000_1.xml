==Music==

===2003-2006: Early Career===
360 made his first official appearance in 2003 on fellow Australian rapper Infallible's EP ''A Burning Ambition'', on the track "Situation Critical" along with MCs [[Hunter (rapper)|Hunter]] and Versa. The following year, he released his debut solo EP, titled ''Rarities'', in which three of its four tracks featured his rap partner and best friend [[Pez (musician)|Pez]].

In 2005, Pez and 360 released a song called "Nutcase", which 360 described as a "fuck around track [that was] written and recorded in one day. Trying to make you laugh, or cringe". 360 was featured on Sydney producers Weapon X and Ken Hell's 2006 mixtape ''Scar-Non III: Kick To The Head'' with the song "In Da Chub", a remix of [[50 Cent]]'s 2003 hit [[In da Club|"In Da Club"]].

===2007–2012: ''What You See Is What You Get'', ''Falling &amp; Flying''===
In February 2007, he signed to Soulmate Records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soulmaterecords.wordpress.com/artists/ |title=Soulmate Records Artist Profiles |publisher=Soulmate Records |accessdate=13 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.grounduphiphop.com/2007/02/04/360-signs-with-soulmate-records/ |title=360 signs with Soulmate Records |publisher=Ground Up Hip-Hop |date=4 February 2007 |accessdate=27 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921181046/http://www.grounduphiphop.com/2007/02/04/360-signs-with-soulmate-records/ |archivedate=21 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He released his debut album, ''What You See Is What You Get'', on 22 March 2008. An ''InTheMix'' reviewer found 360 "not only showcases his hilariously funny comedic side but demonstrates his ability to approach more serious and personal issues, producing a well rounded album".&lt;ref name="InTheMix"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.inthemix.com.au/whatson/melbourne/event/44096/360_What_You_See_Is_What_You_Get_Album_Launch | title = 360 ''What You See Is What You Get'' Album Launch | work = InTheMix | publisher = [[Sound Alliance]] | date = 12 April 2008 | accessdate = 2 December 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130927015013/http://www.inthemix.com.au/whatson/melbourne/event/44096/360_What_You_See_Is_What_You_Get_Album_Launch | archive-date = 27 September 2013 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a video interview for ''Peak Street Magazine'', 360 described his musical style as a combination of "some [[pop music|pop]] influences, [[electro (music)|electro]], [[dubstep]], and unintelligent rhymes".&lt;ref name=ps-video&gt;{{cite web | last=James | first=Sam | title=360 Interview with ''Peak Street'' | url=http://peakstreet.com/post/9094918957/360-vs-peak-street-interview | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130131061052/http://peakstreet.com/post/9094918957/360-vs-peak-street-interview | dead-url=yes | archive-date=31 January 2013 | work=Peak Street Magazine | accessdate=2 December 2012 | first2=Danny | last2=Haneman | first3=Aisha | last3=Glen | date=19 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 January 2008, 360 released a music video of "Mamma Mia", which depicts his desire for [[Bec Hewitt]] and mocked her husband, [[Lleyton Hewitt]], which was the Video of the Week on MySpace.com's Australian hip hop page.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/song-slams-trophy-wife-bec/story-e6frf96x-1111115315578 | title=Rapper 360 makes Bec Hewitt lustful object of lyrics | publisher=[[The Herald and Weekly Times]] ([[News Corporation]]) |work=[[Herald Sun]] | date=14 January 2008 | accessdate=27 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/rapper-360-targets-bec-and-lleyton-hewitt-in-myspace-video/story-e6frewyr-1111115314399 | title=Rapper 360 targets Bec and Lleyton Hewitt in MySpace video | date=14 January 2008 | publisher=[[News Limited]] ([[News Corporation]]) | work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate=27 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 360 described it as a comedic effort, "I wanted to take the piss out of them ... It's not meant to be taken too seriously she's not really my type". Management for the couple dismissed the rapper's effort as "a publicity stunt".&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

By March 2010, he remained signed with Soulmate Records, which had signed a distribution deal with [[EMI Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://soulmaterecords.wordpress.com/2010/03/15/soulmate-records-x-emi-partnership// |title=Soulmate Records partners with EMI |publisher=Soulmate Records | date=15 March 2010 | accessdate=13 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December that year, his single, "Just Got Started" (featuring [[Pez (musician)|Pez]]), was released.&lt;ref name="iTunes10"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://itunes.apple.com/nz/album/just-got-started-feat.-pez/id406702982 | title = 'Just Got Started' (feat.

===2012–present: ''Utopia'' &amp; ''Vintage Modern''===
In June 2012, 360 revealed to national youth broadcaster [[Triple J]] that he was already working on his third album, describing the upcoming release as "quite a dark album". He described it further, "No one sees behind the scenes and there's been a lot of bad (expletive) going on in my family life and personal life". 360 hinted at a diverse production line-up for the album, saying he has "been getting a gang of beats from all different people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=360 readies "dark" new album|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s3518538.htm|website=triple j|publisher=ABC|accessdate=20 October 2014|date=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A video, published on 21 November 2013, served as the official press release for the launch of Forthwrite Records, a music label created by 360 and Pez. 360 then confirmed the announcement on his Facebook page the following day, stating that the label will release ''Don't Look Down'', by Pez, ''[[Utopia (360 album)|Utopia]]'', by 360, and the debut, yet untitled Forthwrite album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=360|title=22 November 2013|url=https://en-gb.facebook.com/3ree6ixty/posts/10153511253795367|website=360 on Facebook|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=2 November 2014|date=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FORTHWRITE RECORDS Media Release 21 Nov 2013|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRkQ8OvXr3A|website=FORTHWRITE on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=2 November 2014|format=Video upload|date=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his performance at the 2013 Sprung Hip Hop Festival, held in [[Brisbane]], Australia, 360 garnered media attention for the manner in which he introduced a new song titled "On A Planet No One Knows". According to 360, the song, which also features a vocal sample from [[Joss Whedon]] regarding gender equality, is "about racism in Australia."&lt;ref name="Plan"&gt;{{cite web|title=WATCH: 360 – 'On A Planet No One Knows’|url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/tv/watch-360-on-a-planet-no-one-knows/|website=Music Feeds|publisher=Music Feeds|accessdate=20 October 2014|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 360 exclaimed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There's a lot of racist cunts in this country [Australia]. I don't know if people are proud to admit it, or what—but there is. No matter what colour or background we are, there are fuckheads in every single race. Generalising everyone is fucking ignorant and uneducated and stupid.

In February 2014, 360 supported the Australian tour of American rapper [[Eminem]], alongside [[Kendrick Lamar]]. 360 described the tour as a career highlight and explained to the media in January 2014 that it would be his first tour sober—he had previously struggled with drug addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Lisa Visentin|title=360 announces tour of Australia|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/360-announces-tour-of-australia-20140527-zrpdp.html|accessdate=20 October 2014|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the release of the artist's third album, ''Utopia'', on 13 June 2014, three singles were released: "Impossible", "On A Planet No One Knows" and "Sixavelli". "Impossible" is a collaboration with [[Daniel Johns]], of Australian band [[Silverchair]], and Johns also appears in the music video, in which he is a passenger in a car driven by 360.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=360 - Impossible (Ft Daniel Johns) Official Video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xU78NDpJt08|website=3ree6ixty on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=20 October 2014|format=Video upload|date=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A music video was also released for the second single and was published on the artist's YouTube channel during the week before [[Australia Day]].&lt;ref name="Plan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=360 - ON A PLANET NO ONE KNOWS|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUWJZSbGF7s|website=3ree6ixty on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=20 October 2014|format=Video upload|date=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music video for "Sixavelli" was directed by Claudia Sangiorgi Dalimore and was published in March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=360 - Sixavelli (Feat.

In 2010, 360 started an online musical project in the Australian hip hop scene, called "Rapper Tag", on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rappertag.com:80/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712043422/http://www.rappertag.com/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 July 2012 |title=Rapper Tag |publisher=360 |accessdate=4 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapper Tag involves one person recording a portion of rap over a looped beat, and then nominating ("tagging") another person to add further rapping over the same loop. The process continued in accordance with the nomination of the next rapper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s3076379.htm |title=Triple J: 360 Rapper Tag Phenomenon |accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.optimising.com.au/blog/interview-on-social-media-with-melbourne-rapper-360/|date=9 March 2011|author=Daniel  |title=Interview on Social Media with Melbourne Rapper 360 |accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian hip hop duo [[Diafrix]] collaborated with 360 for the song "I'm A Dreamer", which appears on the 2012 album ''Pocket Full Of Dreams''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diafrix feat. 360 - I'm A Dreamer (Official Video)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXTRCDRkz34|website=diafrix lion on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=2 November 2014|format=Video upload|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 360 appeared on the self-titled debut album by Canberra producer, Ghosts in the Room, released on 14 September 2012 through Mudd Music.

==Media appearances==
360 was a panel member for the 20 October 2014 edition of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) program ''[[Q&amp;A (Australian talk show)|Q&amp;A]]''. He appeared alongside [[Brian Cox (physicist)|Brian Cox]], a particle physicist, [[Richard Gill (conductor)|Richard Gill]], renowned conductor, and [[Nalini Joshi]], a notable Australian mathematician, to discuss the topic of "passion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=gregmoskovitch|title=Get The Popcorn, 360 Is A Panelist On Next Monday's Q&amp;A|url=http://www.tonedeaf.com.au/421594/360-will-appear-next-mondays-qa.htm|website=Tone Deaf|publisher=Tone Deaf|accessdate=20 October 2014|date=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 360 garnered media attention for his comments on the television program regarding racism in relation to Australia, Australian hip hop and the Australian flag. When questioned by the presenter, 360 replied:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
On Australia Day, you see dudes walking around with their tops off, and they're getting on the drink and all that. And they've got an Australian flag wrapped around their neck. I've seen it so many times; like, I've been in a taxi where we've pulled up because these dickheads have been walking across the road—they just start yelling at the taxi driver, like: "Get out of the country! This is not your country!" ... And they're wearing Australian flags. I've seen it so much, like, growing up ... still today, you know what I mean?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian flag represents racism: 360|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dndT4vq5CpE|website=ABC News (Australia) on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=21 October 2014|format=Video upload|date=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This response caused controversy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=#BBCTrending: Has Australia's flag been co-opted by racists?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-29712614|accessdate=27 October 2014|work=BBC News|date=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the transference of the media spotlight onto Pez, who made comments on social media following 360's appearance. In addition to a message of support for his friend and musical collaborator, Pez also wrote that he also "got a bit offended"; however, he subsequently removed the sentence "To be honest, even I got a bit offended." from his original Facebook post. As of 24 October 2014, 360 had not retracted his ''Q&amp;A'' comments and explained after the airing of the episode: "If you are not racist then you have nothing to be offended about."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Nastassia Baroni|title=Pez Admits To Being "Offended" By 360's 'Q&amp;A' Comments|url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/pez-admits-to-being-offended-by-360s-qa-comments/|website=Music Feeds|publisher=Music Feeds|accessdate=2 November 2014|date=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
{{outdated section|date=September 2016}}
At the age of 18 years, 360 contracted a disease of his right eye, a [[cornea transplant]], which "left him with fuzzy vision" in that eye.&lt;ref name="Adams"/&gt; A July 2014 feature article in ''Rolling Stone Australia'' stated that he is "legally blind in his right eye", while his left eye is "slowly deteriorating due to the degenerative eye disease Keratoconus".&lt;ref name="Jam" /&gt;

On 18 July 2010, 360 was involved in a [[go-kart]]ing accident while celebrating his birthday with Sydney-based hip hop artists [[Bliss n Eso]].

'''Adam Carter''', known by the [[stage name]], '''A-Plus''', is an [[United States|American]] [[rapping|rapper]] and [[Record producer|producer]].  He is one of the founding four members of the [[Oakland, California]]-based [[Alternative hip hop|underground hip hop]] group [[Souls of Mischief]], and, with Souls of Mischief, a part of the eight-person, alternative hip hop [[musical collective|collective]], the [[Hieroglyphics (band)|Hieroglyphics]].

== Biography ==
Born in [[Denver, Colorado]] as the son of [[Jamaica]]n [[immigration|immigrants]], A-Plus moved to [[Oakland, California]] with his family when he was 5 years old.&lt;ref name="Public Service Announcement: A-Plus"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.soundslam.com/articles/interviews/interviews.php?interviews=in051214aplus|accessdate = 2007-02-03|author = Fruchter, Alexander|title = Public Service Announcement: A-Plus|publisher = ''SoundSlam.com''|year = 2003|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090323144248/http://soundslam.com/articles/interviews/interviews.php?interviews=in051214aplus|archivedate = 23 March 2009|deadurl = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[kindergarten]], A-Plus met future [[Hieroglyphics (band)|Hieroglyphics]] member, [[Casual (rapper)|Casual]], and in [[elementary school]], met fellow [[Souls of Mischief]] member [[Tajai]].&lt;ref name="Interview: Casual"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/hiphopinterview/casualint.html |accessdate=2007-02-03 |author=Jones, Todd E. |title=Interview: Casual |publisher=''Hip-Hop Interviews'' |year=2002 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kkmuUQ9A?url=http://www.geocities.com/hiphopinterview/casualint.html |archivedate=2009-10-24 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tajai eventually introduced A-Plus to future Souls of Mischief members [[Phesto]] and [[Opio]], and the group formed in [[high school]] before releasing their debut album, ''[[93 'til Infinity]]'' on [[Jive Records]] in 1993.&lt;ref name="Phesto Interview"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ensim.hieroglyphics.com/artists/souls/phesto-interview.html | accessdate = 2007-02-03 | author = StinkE | title = Phesto Interview | publisher = ''StinkE Productions'' | date = 1996-07-18 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060719094917/http://ensim.hieroglyphics.com/artists/souls/phesto-interview.html | archive-date = 2006-07-19 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After A-Plus and the Souls of Mischief were dropped by Jive, the group was incorporated into the Hieroglyphics in 1995, at the urging of [[Del tha Funkee Homosapien]].&lt;ref name="Phesto Interview"/&gt;

A-Plus has contributed to all four Souls of Mischief albums, as well as the two Hieroglyphic studio albums.  He has also produced or performed on solo projects of various Hieroglyphics' members.

In 2005, A-Plus released a [[remix]] album, ''Pleemix, Vol. 1'', through [[Hieroglyphics Imperium Recordings]].

On May 1, 2007, A-Plus released his debut [[solo album]], ''My Last Good Deed'' through [[Hieroglyphics Imperium Recordings]]. The debut single is "Patna Please."

'''Animat''' (''third-person indicative present of the [[Latin]] verb '''animō'''''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verbix.com/webverbix/go.php?D1=9&amp;H1=109&amp;T1=animo "Animo" at Verbix Latin Verb Conjugator]. Retrieved July 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning to "animate, give or bring life".&lt;ref&gt;[http://latin-dictionary.net/search/latin/animo "Animo" at Latdict Latin Dictionary and Grammar Resources]. Retrieved July 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Animats''' are artificial [[animal]]s, a contraction of [[animal]]-materials. The term includes physical robots and virtual simulations.  Animat research, a subset of [[Artificial Life]] studies, has become rather popular since [[Rodney Brooks]]' seminal paper "Intelligence without representation". The word was coined by S.W. Wilson in 1985,
in "Knowledge growth in an artificial animal", published in the first ''Proceedings'' 
''of an International Conference on Genetic Algorithms and Their Applications''.

An example using the Animat model as proposed by Wilson is discussed at some length in chapter 9 of [[Stan Franklin]]'s book, [[Artificial Minds]]. In this implementation, the animat is capable of independent learning about its environment through application and evolution of pattern-matching rules called "taxons".

In 2001 Thomas DeMarse performed studies on '[[neurally controlled animat]]'.  Every two years, the Society of Adaptive Behaviour meets and produces a proceedings on this topic.  They also have a journal, ''[[Adaptive Behavior]]''.

[[Alan H Goldstein]] has proposed that, because [[nanobiotechnology]] is in the process of creating real animal-materials, speculative use of this term should be discouraged and its application become purely phenomenological.  Based on the Animat Test (contained in the reference  "I, Nanobot.") any nonbiological material or entity that exhibits the minimum set of behaviors that define a life form is, de facto, an Animat.  Goldstein's basic premise is that in the age of nanobiotechnology it is necessary to follow the chemistry and molecular engineering rather than watching for the emergence of some pre-conceived minimum level of 'intelligence' such as an artificial neural network capable of adaptive phenomena.   Goldstein has cautioned that there is a serious disconnect between the fields of nanobiotechnology and A-life based on profound differences in scientific training, experimental systems, and the different sets of terminology (jargon) these two fields have produced.  Nanobiotechnologists (really molecular engineers who work with both biological and nonbiological molecules) are generally not concerned with complex systems per se; even when they are building molecular interconnects between such systems, e.g. neuroelectronic splices.  A-Life researchers mainly take a systems-level approach.  The enormous transformative power of novel molecular engineering has the potential to create Animats, true nonbiological life forms, whose relatively simple behavior would not fit into most standard A-Life paradigms.  As a result, Goldstein argues, the first Animats may come into being completely unrecognized by either scientific community.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3902">{{about|the hypothetical self-replicating spacecraft concept|the side game from Space Quest III|Astro Chicken}}

'''Astrochicken''' is the name given to a [[thought experiment]] expounded by [[theoretical physicist]] [[Freeman Dyson]]. In his book ''Disturbing the Universe'' (1979), Dyson contemplated how humanity could build a small, [[Self-replication|self-replicating]] automaton that could explore space more efficiently than a manned craft could. He attributed the general idea to [[John von Neumann]], based on a lecture von Neumann gave in 1948 titled ''The General and Logical Theory of Automata''. Dyson expanded on von Neumann's [[Automata theory|automata theories]] and added a biological component to them.

Astrochicken, Dyson explained, would be a one-kilogram [[spacecraft]] unlike any before it. It would be a creation of the intersection of biology, [[artificial intelligence]] and modern microelectronics&amp;mdash;a blend of organic and electronic components. Astrochicken would be launched by a conventional spacecraft into space, like an egg being laid into space. Astrochicken would then hatch and start growing a solar-energy collector. The solar collector would feed an [[ion drive]] engine that would power the craft. Once Astrochicken entered a planet's vicinity, it would collect material from the moons and rings of the planet, taking in nutrients. It could land and take off using an auxiliary chemical rocket similar to that used by [[bombardier beetle]]s. It would periodically transmit details of its journey when it could make radio contact with Earth.

The term "astrochicken" does not occur in Dyson's earliest essays regarding [[Self-replicating_spacecraft#Von_Neumann_probes|von Neumann-inspired automata]]. The concept was announced in a lecture Dyson was giving in [[Adelaide, Australia]] on the subject of space exploration with [[biotechnology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/ccc/cc121802.html|title=Cambridge Conference Correspondence|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An audience member called out "Oh, you mean this is an astro-chicken." and the whimsical name caught on, with Dyson beginning to use it himself in subsequent essays he wrote on his theoretical biotechnology spacecraft.

Today, Dyson's Astrochicken resonates with several theories of how space exploration might proceed in the future. Computer scientist [[Rodney Brooks]] has proposed sending a multitude of cheap, bug-like robots to explore Mars instead of solitary, expensive rovers. Cheaper and smaller means of studying space have also been the primary design philosophy of [[NASA]] for many years, perhaps best exemplified by the [[Mars Pathfinder]] mission. Physicist and noted author [[Michio Kaku]] wrote in his work ''Hyperspace'', "Small, lightweight, and intelligent, Astrochicken is a versatile space probe that has a clear advantage over the bulky, exorbitantly expensive space missions of the past, which have been a bottleneck to space exploration. ... It will not need huge quantities of rocket fuel; it will be bred and programmed to 'eat' ice and hydrocarbons found in the rings surrounding the outer planets".

As a noted author of essays on the possibilities of science in the future, Dyson's theories, such as the [[Dyson sphere]] and the [[Dyson tree]], have become popular in the scientific and [[science fiction]] communities. The more whimsically named "Astrochicken" has not achieved this same level of fame.

[[File:Baopuzi.JPG|thumb|First Page of ''Baopuzi'' Inner Chapter 9]]
[[File:Laojunfu.gif|thumb|''Laojun rushan fu'' 老君入山符 "Lord [[Laozi|Lao]]'s amulet for entering mountains" from ''Baopuzi'' Inner Chapter 17]]
The '''''Baopuzi''''' ({{zh|s=抱朴子|t=抱朴子|p=Bàopǔzǐ|w=Pao-p'u-tzu|l=[Book of the] Master Who Embraces Simplicity}}), written by the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] scholar [[Ge Hong]] 葛洪 (283-343), is divided into esoteric ''Neipian'' 內篇 "Inner Chapters" and exoteric ''Waipian'' 外篇 "Outer Chapters". The [[Daoist]] Inner Chapters discuss topics such as techniques for [[Xian (Taoism)|''xian'']] 仙 "immortality; transcendence", [[Chinese alchemy]], elixirs, and demonology. The [[Confucianist]] Outer Chapters discuss [[Chinese literature]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], politics, and society.

==Title==
The [[eponymous]] title ''Baopuzi'' derives from Ge Hong's [[Art name|''hao'']] 號 "sobriquet; pseudonym" Baopuzi (lit. "embrace simplicity master"), which compounds ''bao'' [[Wikt:抱|抱]] "embrace; hug; carry; hold in both arms; cherish", ''[[Pu (Daoism)|pu]]'' or [[Wikt:朴|朴]] "uncarved wood, [a [[Taoism#Pu|Daoist metaphor]] for a] person's original nature; simple; plain", and ''zi'' [[Wikt:子|子]] "child; offspring; master [title of respect]". ''Baopu'' is a classical allusion to the ''[[Daodejing]]'' (19, tr. Mair 1990:181), "Evince the plainness of undyed silk, embrace the simplicity of the unhewn log; lessen selfishness, diminish desires; abolish learning and you will be without worries."

Ge Hong's autobiography explains choosing his [[pen name]] Baopuzi.
&lt;blockquote&gt;It has been my plan to preserve regularity and not to follow the whims of the world. My speech is frank and sincere; I engage in no banter. If I do not come upon the right person, I can spend the day in silence. This is the reason my neighbors call me Simplex (''Pao-p'u''), which name I have used as a sobriquet in my writings. (tr. Ware 1966:10) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Compare these autobiography translations: (Davis and Ch'en 1941:301) "people all call me a ''pao-p'u'' scholar (i.e., one who keeps his basic nature, one who is unperturbed by the desires of the world)"; (Sailey 1978:251) "among the people of his district there were those who called him "The Scholar Who Embraces Simplicity"."  Wu and Davis (1935:224) noted, "This name has been translated ''Old Sober-Sides'', but Dr. Wu considers that it has no satirical intent and would better be translated ''Solemn-Seeming Philosopher''." Fabrizio Pregadio (2006:2) translates "Master Who Embraces Spontaneous Nature".

==History==
Compared with many other Daoist texts, the origins of the ''Baopuzi'' are well documented. Ge completed the book during the Jianwu 建武 era (317–318), when [[Emperor Yuan of Jin]] founded the Eastern Jin Dynasty, and revised it during the Xianhe 咸和 era (326-334).

Ge Hong's autobiography (Outer Chapter 50) records writing the ''Baopuzi''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In my twenties I planned to compose some little things in order not to waste my time, for it seemed best to create something that would constitute the sayings of one sole thinker. This is when I outlined my philosophical writing, but it was also the moment when I became involved in armed rebellion and found myself wandering and scattered even farther afield, some of my things getting lost. Although constantly on the move, I did not abandon my brush again for a dozen or so years, so that at the age of 37 or 38 [A.D. 317-18] I found my work completed. In all, I have composed ''Nei p'ien'' in 20 scrolls, ''Wai p'ien'' in 50; … [list of other writings, totaling 310 scrolls] My ''Nei p'ien'', telling of gods and genii, prescriptions and medicines, ghosts and marvels, transformations, maintenance of life, extension of years, exorcising evils, and banishing misfortune, belongs to the Taoist school. My ''Wai p'ien'', giving an account of success and failure in human affairs and of good and evil in public affairs, belongs to the Confucian school. (tr. Ware 1966:17, cf. Sailey 1978:264)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Compare the more literal translation of Davis and Ch'en (1941:301), "I left off writing for ten and odd years, for I was constantly on the road, until the era Chien-wu 建武 (317-318 A.D.) when I got it ready."

Ge's autobiography mentions his military service fighting rebels against the Jin Dynasty, and successfully defending his hometown of Jurong 句容 (in modern [[Zhenjiang]], [[Jiangsu]]). In 330 (tr. Ware 1966:20), [[Emperor Cheng of Jin]] granted Ge the fief of "Marquis of [[Guanzhong]]" with income from 200 Jurong households. Scholars believe Ge revised the ''Baopuzi'' during this period, sometime around 330 (Komjathy 2004:22) or 332 (Wu and Davis 1935:224).

The ''Baopuzi'' consists of 70 ''pian'' 篇 "chapters; books" divided between the 20 "Inner Chapters" and 50 "Outer Chapters" (cf. the ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' textual division). [[Nathan Sivin]] (1969:389) described it as "not one book but two, considerably different in theme". The ''Neipian'' and ''Waipian'' "led entirely separate physical existences; they were not combined under a single title until a millennium after Ko's time".

The (1444–1445) [[Ming Dynasty]] ''[[Daozang]]'' "Daoist canon" first printed the two ''Baopuzi'' parts together. This ''Zhengtong Daozang'' 正統道藏 "Daoist Canon of the [[Zhengtong Emperor|Zhengtong]] Era (1436-1450)" bibliographically categorized the ''Baopuzi'' under the ''Taiqing'' 太清 "Supreme Clarity" section for alchemical texts. ''Daozang'' editions encompass six ''juan'' (卷 "scrolls; fascicles; volumes"), three each for the Inner and Outer Chapters. Most received versions of ''Baopuzi'' descend from this Ming ''Daozang'' text.

==Content==
The ''Baopuzi'' Inner and Outer Chapters discuss miscellaneous topics ranging from [[esotericism]] to [[social philosophy]]. The Inner Chapters discuss techniques of [[Xian (Taoism)|''xian'']] 仙 "immortality; transcendence", [[Chinese alchemy]], meditation, [[Daoist yoga]], [[Daoyin]], [[Taoist sexual practices|sexual techniques]], [[Chinese herbology]], demons, and [[Fulu|''fu'']] 符 "magic talismans". The Outer Chapters discuss [[Chinese philosophy]], [[Confucianism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], government, politics, literature, scholarship, and include Ge's autobiography, which Waley (1930:10) called "the fullest document of this kind that early China produced".

According to Ge Hong's autobiography, he divided the Inner and Outer Chapters on the distinction between [[Daoism]] and [[Confucianism]]. Ge philosophically described Daoism as the ''ben'' 本 "root; trunk; origin" and Confucianism as the ''mo'' 末 "tip; branch; end" (Inner Chapter 10, tr. Ware 1966:165). When asked, "Which has the priority, Confucianism or Taoism?" – Baopuzi replies, "Taoism is the very trunk of Confucianism, but Confucianism is only a branch of Taoism."

While the ''Baopuzi'' Inner and Outer Chapters differ in content, they share a general format with an unnamed interlocutor posing questions and Ge Hong providing answers. The conventional syntax is ''Huowen yue'' 或問曰 "Someone asked, saying" and ''Baopuzi da yue'' 抱樸子答曰 "Baopuzi answered, saying".

===Inner Chapters===
The twenty ''Neipian'' "Inner Chapters" record arcane techniques for achieving ''xian'' "transcendence; immortality". These techniques span two types of Chinese alchemy that [[Tang Dynasty]] scholars later differentiated into ''[[neidan]]'' 內丹 "internal elixir; internal alchemy" and ''[[waidan]]'' 外丹 "external elixir; external alchemy". The word ''dan'' [[Wikt:丹|丹]] "[[cinnabar]]; red; pellet; [Chinese medicine] pill" means  "[[Pill of Immortality|pill of immortality]], or [[elixir of life]]. Ge Hong details his researches into the arts of transcendence and immortality. "Internal alchemy" concerns creating an "immortal body" within the corporeal body through both physiological methods (dietary, respiratory, sexual, etc.) and mental practices (meditation, visualization, etc.). "External" or "laboratory alchemy" concerns compounding elixirs (esp. from minerals and metals), writing ''fu'' talismans or amulets, herbalism, and exorcism.

Lai outlines the Inner Chapters subjects:
&lt;blockquote&gt; (1) proofs of the ''per se'' existence of immortals and transcendent states of immortality of the body; (2) stipulation of the accessibility to the perfect state of long life to everyone, irrespective of one's social status but dependent on whether one could study deeply and strenuously cultivate the necessary esoteric methods; (3) elaboration of diverse esoteric techniques leading one to become a ''hsien''-immortal; and (4) descriptions and criticism of the diverse contemporary Taoist discourses and sects. (1998:191-2) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Several chapters have specific themes. Chapters 4, 8, 11, and 16 describe ''waidan'' "external alchemy". Inner Chapter 18 details meditation practices. In Chapter 19, Ge Hong praises his master Zheng Yin 鄭隱 (ca. 215-ca. 302), catalogues Daoist books, and lists talismans (see Ware 1966:379-385).

Many scholars have praised the Inner Chapters. [[Joseph Needham]] (1954:437), who called Ge Hong "the greatest alchemist in Chinese history", quoted the following passage about medicines from different biological categories.
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Interlocutor'': Life and death are predetermined by fate and their duration is normally fixed. Life is not something any medicine can shorten or lengthen. A finger that has been cut off cannot be joined on again and expected to continue growing. Blood from a wound, though swallowed, is of no benefit. Therefore, it is most inappropriate to approve of taking such nonhuman substances as pine or thuya [cypress] to protract the brief span of life. &lt;br&gt;
''Ko'': According to your argument, a thing is beneficial only if it belongs to the same category as that which is treated. … If we followed your suggestion and mistrusted things of a different type, we would be obliged to crush flesh and smelt bone to prepare a medicine for wounds, or to fry skin and roast hair to treat baldness. Water and soil are not of the same substance as the various plants; yet the latter rely upon them for growth. The grains are not of the same species as living men; yet living men need them in order to stay alive. Fat is not to be classed with fire, nor water with fish, yet when there is no more fat the fires dies, and when there is no more water, fish perish. (3, tr. Ware 1966:61-62) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Needham (1954:439) evaluated this passage, "Admittedly there is much in the ''Pao Phu Tzu'' which is wild, fanciful and superstitious, but here we have a discussion scientifically as sound as anything in Aristotle, and very much superior to anything which the contemporary occident could produce."

In addition to quoting early alchemical texts, the Inner Chapters describe Ge Hong's laboratory experiments. Wu and Davis mention  the ''Baopuzi'' formula for making [[mosaic gold]] "a golden crystalline powder used as a pigment" from ''chiyan'' 赤塩 "red crystal salt" (produced from [[amethyst]], [[calcite]] [[crystal]], and [[alum]]; Ware 1966:273) and ''huizhi'' 灰汁 "[[limewater]]".
&lt;blockquote&gt;The description of one process deserves special discussion, for it evidently concerns the preparation of stannic sulfide or "mosaic gold" and is perhaps the earliest known description of the preparation of this interesting substance. Mosaic gold exists in flakes or leaflets which have the color and the luster of gold, it does not tarnish, and is used at present for bronzing radiators, gilding picture frames and similar purposes. As Ko Hung describes the process, "tin sheets, each measuring six inches square by one and two-tenths inches thick, are covered with a one-tenth inch layer of a mud-like mixture of ''Ch'ih Yen'' (Red Salt) and ''Huei Chih'' (potash-water, limewater), ten pounds of tin to every four of ''Ch'ih Yen''." They are then heated in a sealed earthenware pot for thirty days with horse manure (probably with a smouldering fire of dried manure). "All the tin becomes ash like and interspersed with bean-like pieces which are the yellow gold." The large portion of the metallic tin is converted into some ash-like compound or possibly into the ash-like allotropic modification, gray tin. A small portion of the tin is converted into bean-sized aggregates of flaky stannic sulfide. The yield is poor, for the author says that "twenty ounces of gold are obtained from every twenty pounds of tin used." (1935:232) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The authors add, "It seems likely that Ko Hung was personally experienced in the chemistry of tin, for the Chinese say that he was the first to make [[tin foil]] and that he made magic or spirit money out of it."

===Outer Chapters===
The fifty ''Waipian'' "Outer Chapters" are more diffuse than the Inner ones. Ge Hong diversely wrote essays on Jin Dynasty issues in philosophy, morality, politics, and society. This ''Baopuzi'' portion details everyday problems among Han Dynasty northerners who fled into south China after the fall of [[Luoyang]].

Some of the Outer Chapters are thematically organized. Ge Hong wrote chapters 46, 47, and 48 to dispute three adversaries. Guo Tai 郭太 (128-169) founded of the ''[[Qingtan]]'' "pure conversation" school; Ni Heng 禰衡 (173-198) was an infamously arrogant official of [[Cao Cao]]; and [[Pao Ching-yen|Bao Jingyan]] 鮑敬言 (ca. 405-ca. 466) was an early anarchist philosopher.

==Translations==
The Chinese ''Baopuzi'' has been translated into English, Italian, German, and Japanese. There are more English translations of the twenty Inner Chapters than the fifty Outer Chapters.

The Inner Chapters have several partial translations. Tenney L. Davis, professor of organic chemistry at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], collaborated on first translations of the Inner Chapters relevant to the [[history of alchemy]]. Wu and Davis (1935) translated chapters 4 "On the Gold Medicine" and 16 "On the Yellow and White" (i.e., gold and silver). Davis and Ch'en (1941) translated chapters 8 "Overcoming Obstructions" and 11 "On ''hsien'' Medicines", and provided paraphrases or summaries of the remaining Inner Chapters. The French sinologist Eugene Feifel made English translations of chapters 1-3 (1941), 4 (1944), and 11 (1946). More recently, excerpts from the Inner Chapters are quoted by Verellen (1999) and Pregadio (2006).

The Inner Chapters have one complete translation by James R. Ware (1966), which also includes Ge Hong's autobiography from Outer Chapter 50 (1966:6-21). Several reviewers censured the quality of Ware's translation, for instance, Kroll (1982:139) called it "at times misguided". Huard's and Wong's (1968) critical assessment of Ware was criticized in turn by Sivin (1969:388). "Their review, nonetheless, can only be described as perfunctory. Only the forematter and endmatter of Ware's book are evaluated, and that in a curiously cursory fashion."

Translating the fundamental Daoist word ''[[Tao|Dao]]'' or ''Tao'' "way; path; principle" as English ''[[God]]'' is a conspicuous peculiarity of Ware's ''Baopuzi'' version. The Introduction gives a convoluted Christian justification, first quoting J.J.L. Duyvendak's translation of ''[[Daodejing]]'' 25, "Its rightful name I do not know, but I give It the sobriquet ''Tao'' (= God). If a rightful name is insisted upon, I would call It Maximal." 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Then, upon noticing that ''Tao Te Ching'', verse 34, is willing to call the Something "Minimal," every schoolman would have understood that the Chinese author was talking about God, for only in God do contraries become identical! Accordingly, the present translator will always render this use of the term Tao by ''God''. In doing so, he keeps always in mind as the one and only definition the equation establishable from ''Exod''. 3:13-15 and ''Mark'' 12:26-27, to mention only two very clear statements. It will be recalled that in the first God says, "My name is I am, I live, I exist," while the second reads, "God is not of the dead but of the living." Therefore, God = Life or Being. (1966:1-2) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Ware admitted his ''God'' for ''Dao'' translation cannot be applied consistently.
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is clear that the word ''tao'' appears frequently in this text not as a designation of God but of the process by which God is to be approximated or attained. In such cases I shall translate it as "the divine process." In instances where either this or "God" would be appropriate, a translator is obliged to be arbitrary. The term ''tao shih'' is rendered "processor"; ''hsien'' is translated "genie" rather than "immortal". (1966:3) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
These Chinese words are ''daoshi'' [[Wikt:道士|道士]] "Daoist priest; Daoist practitioner" and [[Xian (Taoism)|''xian'']] [[Wikt:仙|仙]] "immortal; transcendent". Ho Peng-Yoke, an authority in the [[History of science and technology in China]], criticized Ware's mistranslations. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;It may be true that in certain areas the concept of Tao overlaps with the definition and attributes of God, or for that matter with those of Allah, for example oneness and eternity. However, there is the danger of the analogy being pushed too far. Similarly, the reader might be warned that "Genii," as used for rendering the word ''hsien'', does not convey the concept of some supernatural slaves as found in the lamp and the ring of the ''Thousand-and-One Nights''. The reviewer prefers the terminology used by Tenny L. Davis, i.e. ''Tao'' left untranslated and "immortal" for ''hsien''. (1967:145) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Nevertheless, Ho's review concluded with praise. "Professor Ware is to be congratulated for bringing out the translation of a most difficult Chinese Taoist text in a very readable form. One cannot find another text that gives so much useful and authoritative information on alchemy and Taoism in fourth-century China."

Ge Hong wrote the ''Baopuzi'' in elegant [[Classical Chinese grammar]] and terminology, but some Inner Chapter contexts are difficult to translate. Comparing three versions of this passage listing ''xian'' medicines illustrates the translational choices.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The best ''hsien'' medicine is cinnabar. Others in the order of decreasing excellence are gold, silver, ''chih'', the five jades, mica, pearl, realgar, ''t'ai i yü yü liang'', ''shih chung huang tzu'' 石中黄子 (literally yellow nucleus in stone), ''shih kuei'' 石桂 (stony cinnamon), quartz, ''shih nao'' 石腦, ''shih liu huang'' 石硫黄 (a kind of raw sulfur), wild honey and ''tseng ch'ing''. (11, tr. Davis and Ch'en 1941:311) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Medicines of superior quality for immortality are: cinnabar; next comes gold, then follows silver, then the many ''chih'', then the five kinds of jade, then mica, then ''ming-chu'', then realgar, then brown hematite, then conglomerate masses of brown hematite, then stone cassia (?), then quartz, then paraffin, then sulphur, then wild honey, then malachite (stratified variety) (tr. Feifel 1946:2) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;At the top of the genie's pharmacopoeia stands cinnabar. Second comes gold; third, silver, fourth, excresences; fifth, the jades; sixth, mica; seventh, pearls; eighth, realgar; ninth, brown hematite; tenth, conglomerated brown hematite; eleventh, quartz; twelfth, rock crystal; thirteenth, geodes; fourteenth, sulphur; fifteenth, wild honey; and sixteenth, laminar malachite. (tr. Ware 1966:178) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Baoppuzi'' Outer Chapters have one partial translation into English. Jay Sailey (1978) translated 21 of the 50 chapters: 1, 3, 5, 14-15, 20, 24-26, 30-34, 37, 40, 43-44, 46-47, and 50. In addition, Sailey (1978:509-545) included appendices on "Buddhism and the ''Pao-p'u-tzu''", "Biography of Ko Hung" from the ''[[Jin Shu]]'', and "Recensions" of lost ''Baopuzi'' fragments quoted in later texts. Kroll (1982:139) gave a mixed review, "Although Sailey's renderings frequently obscure Ko Hung's carefully polished diction and nuance, they reliably convey the sense of the original and should be a substantial boon to Western students of medieval Chinese thought and culture."

For centuries, traditional scholars have revered the ''Baopuzi'' as a canonical Daoist scripture – but in recent years, modern scholars have reevaluated the text.

Traditional scholarship viewed the ''Baopuzi'', especially the Inner Chapters, as a primary textual source for early Chinese ''waidan'' "external alchemy". Wu and Davis described it as, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;probably the widest known and highest regarded of the ancient Chinese treatises on alchemy. It has been preserved for us as part of the Taoist canon. It shows us the art matured by five or six centuries of practice, having its traditional heroes and an extensive literature, its technique and philosophy now clearly fixed, its objectives and pretentions established. This art the author examines in a hardheaded manner and expounds in language which is remarkably free from subterfuge. (1935:221) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Arthur Waley]] praised Ge Hong's rational attitude toward alchemy.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nowhere in Pao P'u Tzu's book do we find the hierophantic tone that pervades most writings on alchemy both in the East and in the West. He uses a certain number of secret terms, such as 金公 "metal-lord" and 河車 "river chariot", both of which mean lead; and 河上她女 "the virgin on the river", which means mercury … But his attitude is always that of a solidly educated layman examining claims which a narrow-minded orthodoxy had dismissed with contempt. (1930:13) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the estimation of Ho (1967:145), the ''Baopuzi'' is a "more important" alchemical text than [[Wei Boyang]]'s (ca. 142) ''[[Cantong qi]]'' 參同契 "The Kinship of the Three". The ''Baopuzi'' mentions a ''Neijing'' 內經 "Inner Classic" by Wei Boyang, but curiously does not mention Wei's ''Cantong ji''.

Modern scholarship has taken another look at the ''Baopuzi''. Sivin demeans the text's significance.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Inner Chapters are anything but the writings of a Taoist man of wisdom or organizer for his disciples or for other initiates. This book is a vast trove of commonplaces and hearsay about popular beliefs in which Ko's few incontestably Taoist texts play an essential but small part. Its goal is not to catalogue, synthesize, or provide a handbook of techniques. It is rather a dialogue in which Ko hurls scattershot against a skeptical anonymous interlocutor. The Inner Chapters are a one-issue book. Ko seeks to convince his questioner, and thereby his readers, that immortality is a proper object of study and is attainable – not only by the ancients but in his own time, not only by a destined few but by anyone with enough faith to undertake arduous and dangerous disciplines. The devotion that Ko calls for implies wholesale acceptance of legends, myths, tales of prodigies, magical beliefs, religious faiths – practically every belief current in the popular imagination of Ko's time and the inverse in almost every sense of what "fundamentalist Confucian" humanists considered worthy of thought (but then they were no longer setting the intellectual style). (1978:345) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Sivin sarcastically compares Ge Hong, "an obsessed bookman and indiscriminate lore-collector", with [[Alan Watts]]. "Ko's style was rather than of a pedantic purveyor of occultism to the upper class. I can only think of him as the Alan Watts of his time."  However, James Benn (2003:139) observes, "This judgement is perhaps not as damning as Professor Sivin intended. Certainly, one would not now go to Watts in the hope of learning much about Taoism, but a close study of his work would tell us a great deal about perceptions and presuppositions concerning Asian religions in mid-twentieth century America. Like Watts and others of his generation it is true that Ge Hong did see religion as a personal matter, and he seems to have approached it from the point of view of a fan or enthusiast more than as an initiate."

Chi-Tim Lai (1998:199) interprets the Inner Chapters as a "new discourse" on ''xian''-immortality through personal salvation and perfection, contrasting with the traditional "imperial discourse" that only the rich could afford ''xian''-hood. For example, histories record that both [[Qin Shi Huang]] and [[Emperor Wu of Han]] dispatched imperial naval expeditions to obtain the "elixir of immortality" from mythical [[Mount Penglai]]. "That is, an individual's self-perfection is only dependent upon ascetic, mystic, and ethical behavior. Since it is a new religious discourse supposedly open to all people, the quest for a prolonged life is no longer the preserve of the wealthy and powerful."
&lt;blockquote&gt;According to Ko Hung, the ''hsien''-immortals who can achieve the complete avoidance of death rarely come from the social groups of worthies, emperors, or sages. Hence, he implies that ''hsien''-immortality are distinctive "human" ideal values to be pursued and potentially achieved by anyone. In the first, in order to differentiate the ideal values of ''hsien''-immortal from this worldly worthies and powers, Ko Hung says, "Those who attained immortal were almost all poor and lowly. They were not men of position and power."' Second, in placing the ideal of ''hsien''-immortality out of the reach of imperial figures, Ko Hung rebukes emperors such as the First Emperor of the Ch'in and Emperor Han-wu-ti, who were "models" of seeking for immortality in ancient Chinese history and literature, by saying, "These two emperors had a hollow reputation for wanting immortality, but they never experienced the reality of cultivating the Tao." (Lai 1998:210) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ge Hong quotes his teacher Zheng Yin explaining that poverty forces ''daoshi'' "Daoist practitioners" seeking ''xian'' techniques to engage in the difficulties and dangers of alchemy.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Then I asked further, "Why should we not eat the gold and silver which are already in existence instead of taking the trouble to make them? What are made will not be real gold and silver but just make-believes."

Said Cheng Chun in reply, "The gold and silver which are found in the world are suitable for the purpose. But ''Tao-shih'' are all poor; witness the adage that ''Hsien'' are never stout and ''Tao-shih'' never rich. ''Tao-shih'' usually go in groups of five or ten, counting the teacher and his disciples. Poor as they are, how can they be expected to get the necessary gold and silver? Furthermore they cannot cover the great distances to gather the gold and silver which occur in nature. The only thing left for them to do is to make the metals themselves". (16, tr. Wu and Davis 1935:260-1) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Ware (1966:268) translates this adage, "There are no fat genii and no rich processors".

For a wealthy person seeking ''xian''-transcendence, Ge Hong recommends compounding ''jinye'' 金液 (lit. "gold liquid/fluid") "golden liquor" in a ''huachi'' 花池 (lit. "flower pond") "a vinegar solvent" (fortified with [[saltpeter]]; Ware 1966:347). This is simpler to produce than traditional ''jiuding'' 九鼎 "nine tripods" elixirs (attributed to the [[Yellow Emperor]]), but expensive – eight doses cost 400,000 [[Cash (Chinese coin)|cash]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;True it is that the nine medicines are the best of ''Hsien'' medicines. Yet the materials for their compounding are quite numerous. They are easily procurable only in large cities which have good facilities for communication, but are not to be obtained at other places. Furthermore, in the compounding of the medicines, the fires should be tended for tens of days and nights with industrious application and close adjustment, which is a great difficulty. The compounding of the Gold Fluid is much easier. There the only thing which is difficult is to get the gold. One pound in the old measure is equivalent to two in our contemporary measure. Such a quantity of gold would cost only some three hundred thousand cash. The other auxiliary materials are easy to procure. In the compounding, no fire is required. All that needs to be done is to have the mixture in a ''Hua Ch'ih'' (Flower Pond) for the necessary number of days. A total expenditure of four hundred thousand cash will make an amount large enough to transform eight persons into ''Hsien''. Just as no wine is formed by the fermentation of small quantities of rice, so small quantities of materials will not be able to interact to give the medicine. (4, tr. Wu and Davis 1935:251) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pregadio (2006:215) says recent studies show Ge's intent was "glorifying the religious and ritual legacy of [[Jiangnan]] 江南 (the region south of the lower Yangzi River), emphasizing the superiority of certain traditions over others, and enhancing their prestige among the social elite to which Ge Hong belonged." Nonetheless, Pregadio concludes, &lt;blockquote&gt;Ge Hong's testimony deserves attention as a valuable overview of the religious traditions of Jiangnan just before the Way of the Celestial Masters ([[Tianshi dao]]) spread to that area, soon followed by the [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] and [[Lingbao School|Lingbao]] revelations. From this point of view, the ''Baopu zi'' documents important links between the earlier and later history of Taoism, as it also does for medicine and other fields. (2006:217) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Shimmering bees drive hornet away.ogv|thumb|A population of bees shimmers in response to a predator.]]

'''Biological organization''' is the [[hierarchy]] of [[complex systems|complex]] [[biology|biological]] [[structures]] and [[systems]] that define [[life]] using a [[Reductionism|reductionistic]] approach.&lt;ref name="Solomon intro"&gt;{{harvnb|Solomon|Berg|Martin|2002|pp=9&amp;ndash;10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional hierarchy, as detailed below, extends from [[atom]]s to [[biosphere]]s. The higher levels of this scheme are often referred to as an '''ecological organization''' concept, or as the [[Branches of science|field]],  [[#Fundamentals|hierarchical ecology]].

Each level in the hierarchy represents an increase in organizational [[wikt:complexity|complexity]], with each "object" being primarily composed of the previous level's basic unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pavé|2006|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic principle behind the organization is the concept of ''[[emergence]]''—the properties and functions found at a hierarchical level are not present and irrelevant at the lower levels.

The biological organization of life is a fundamental premise for numerous areas of [[scientific research]], particularly in the [[Medicine|medical sciences]]. Without this necessary degree of organization, it would be much more difficult—and likely impossible—to apply the study of the effects of various [[physical phenomenon|physical]] and [[chemical phenomenon|chemical]] phenomena to [[diseases]] and [[physiology]] (body function). For example, fields such as [[cognitive neuroscience|cognitive]] and [[behavioral neuroscience]] could not exist if the brain was not composed of specific types of cells, and the basic concepts of [[pharmacology]] could not exist if it was not known that a change at the cellular level can affect an entire organism. These applications extend into the [[ecological]] levels as well. For example, [[DDT]]'s direct [[insecticide|insecticidal]] effect occurs at the [[subcellular]] level, but affects higher levels up to and including multiple [[ecosystem]]s. Theoretically, a change in one [[atom]] could change the entire [[biosphere]].

==Levels==
[[File:Levels of Organization.svg|thumb|The simplest unit of life is the atom, like oxygen. Two or more atoms is a molecule, like a dioxide. Many small molecules may combine in a chemical reaction to make up a macromolecule, such as a phospholipid. Multiple macromolecules form a cell, like a club cell. A group of cells functioning together as a tissue, for example, Epithelial tissue. Different tissues make up an organ, like a lung. Organs work together to form an organ system, such as the Respiratory System. All of the organ systems make a living organism, like a lion. A group of the same organism living together in an area is a population, such as a pride of lions. Two or more populations interacting with each other form a community, for example, lion and zebra populations interacting with each other.  Communities interacting not only with each other but also with the physical environment encompass an ecosystem, such as the Savanna ecosystem. All of the ecosystems make up the biosphere, the area of life on Earth.]]
The simple standard biological organization scheme, from the lowest level to the highest level, is as follows:&lt;ref name="Solomon intro"/&gt;

More complex schemes incorporate many more levels. For example, a molecule can be viewed as a grouping of [[chemical element|elements]], and an atom can be further divided into [[subatomic particle]]s (these levels are outside the scope of biological organization). Each level can also be broken down into its own hierarchy, and specific types of these biological objects can have their own hierarchical scheme. For example, [[genome]]s can be further subdivided into a hierarchy of [[gene]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pavé|2006|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each level in the hierarchy can be described by its lower levels. For example, the organism may be described at any of its component levels, including the atomic, molecular, cellular, histological (tissue), organ and organ system levels. Furthermore, at every level of the hierarchy, new functions necessary for the control of life appear. These new roles are not functions that the lower level components are capable of and are thus referred to as ''[[Emergence#Emergent properties and processes|emergent properties]]''.

Every organism is organised, though not necessarily to the same degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Postlethwait|Hopson|2006|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; An organism can not be organised at the [[histological]] (tissue) level if it is not composed of tissues in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Witzany | first1 = G | year = 2014 | title = Biological Self-organization | url = | journal = International Journal of Signs and Semiotic Systems | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 1–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fundamentals ==
Empirically, a large proportion of the (complex) biological systems we observe in nature exhibit hierarchic structure. On theoretical grounds we could expect complex systems to be hierarchies in a world in which complexity had to evolve from simplicity. [[Systems theory|System]] hierarchies analysis performed in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; laid the empirical foundations for a [[Branches of science|field]] that would be, from the 1980s, '''hierarchical ecology'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Margalef|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wicken|Ulanowicz|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pumain|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jordan|Jørgensen|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theoretical foundations are summarized by thermodynamics.
When [[biological systems]] are modeled as [[physical system]]s, in its most general abstraction, they are [[Thermodynamic system#Open system|thermodynamic open systems]] that exhibit [[self-organization|self-organised]] behavior, and the [[Set theory|set/subset]] relations between [[dissipative structures]] can be characterized in a hierarchy.

A simpler and more direct way to explain the fundamentals of the "hierarchical organization of life", was introduced in [[Ecology]] by [[Howard T. Odum|Odum]] and others as the "[[Herbert A. Simon|Simon]]'s hierarchical principle";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simon|1969|pp=192–229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simon&lt;ref&gt;Simon's texts at {{doi|10.1207/S15327809JLS1203_4}}, [http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/simon.html polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/simon]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705161014/http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/simon.html |date=July 5, 2015 }} or [http://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/08/29/hierarchical-organization-and-biological-evolution-part-1/ johncarlosbaez/2011/08/29 transcriptions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531145800/https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/08/29/hierarchical-organization-and-biological-evolution-part-1/ |date=2015-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasized that hierarchy "''emerges almost inevitably through a wide variety of evolutionary processes, for the simple reason that &lt;u&gt;hierarchical structures are stable&lt;/u&gt;''".

To motivate this deep idea, he offered his "parable" about imaginary watchmakers.

:{|
!Parable of the Watchmakers
|-
|
There once were two watchmakers, named Hora and Tempus, who made very fine watches. The phones in their workshops rang frequently; new customers were constantly calling them. However, Hora prospered while Tempus became poorer and poorer. In the end, Tempus lost his shop. What was the reason behind this?

The watches consisted of about 1000 parts each. The watches that Tempus made were designed such that, when he had to put down a partly assembled watch (for instance, to answer the phone), it immediately fell into pieces and had to be reassembled from the basic elements.

Hora had designed his watches so that he could put together subassemblies of about ten components each. Ten of these subassemblies could be put together to make a larger sub-assembly. Finally, ten of the larger subassemblies constituted the whole watch. Each subassembly could be put down without falling apart.

'''Bjørn Skogstad Aamo''' (born 21 January 1946) is a Norwegian [[economist]] and [[politician]] for the [[Norwegian Labour Party|Labour Party]]. He was [[State Secretary#Norway|State Secretary]] for three non-consecutive terms between 1973 and 1993, and served as Director of the [[Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway]] from 1993 to 2011.

==Career==
===Political career===
Born in [[Oslo]],&lt;ref name="snl"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title=Aamo, Bjørn Skogstad |encyclopedia=Aschehoug og Gyldendals Store norske leksikon |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location= |url=http://www.snl.no/article.html?id=811613 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aamo grew up in [[Mandal, Norway|Mandal]]. He became involved in politics at an early age, and was appointed chairman of the local [[Workers' Youth League (Norway)|Workers' Youth League]] chapter in 1962. He then moved back to the capital to enroll at the [[University of Oslo]]. He became chairman of the Workers' Youth League chapter there. Situated on the left wing of the organization, he became a vocal opponent of the [[Vietnam War]] as well as the Norwegian [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] membership, much to the dismay of party secretary [[Haakon Lie]]. However, Aamo found support from fellow economist [[Per Kleppe]],&lt;ref name=aamo&gt;{{Cite news|first=Helge |last=Røed |title=En viktig nasjonal strateg |work=Fædrelandsvennen |date=21 January 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at that time a deputy member of the party central committee and head of the [[think tank]] ''Arbeiderbevegelsens utredningskontor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{stortingetbio|PEKL|name=Per Kleppe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aamo graduated with the degree [[cand.oecon.]] in [[economics]] in 1970, and from 1971 to 1972 he worked as personal secretary (today known as political adviser) in the [[Norwegian Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development|Ministry of Local Government and Labour]]. He was then promoted to [[State Secretary (Norway)|State Secretary]] in the [[Norwegian Ministry of Finance|Ministry of Finance]] from 1973 to 1979, serving under Per Kleppe who had become [[Minister of Finance (Norway)|Minister of Finance]].&lt;ref name=aamo-2&gt;{{Cite news|agency=Norwegian News Agency |title=60 år 21. januar: Kredittilsynsdirektør Bjørn Skogstad Aamo |date=30 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was then head of the department of economics in the [[European Free Trade Association]] from 1979 to 1981, and director{{Clarify|date=September 2010}} of the [[Regional Development Fund]] from 1981 to 1986. He then returned as State Secretary from 1986 to 1989 under Minister of Finance [[Gunnar Berge]] in [[Brundtland's Second Cabinet]]. He lost his job when Brundtland's Second Cabinet fell in 1989, and briefly returned to Regional Development Fund. In 1990 as the short-lived [[Syse's Cabinet]] fell and [[Brundtland's Third Cabinet]] assumed office, Aamo was appointed State Secretary at the [[Norwegian Office of the Prime Minister|Office of the Prime Minister]].&lt;ref name="aamo-2"/&gt;

===Financial Supervisory Authority===
In 1993 he was appointed Director of the [[Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway|Financial Supervisory Authority]], succeeding [[Svein Aasmundstad]]. This decision was criticized by the political opposition.&lt;ref name=negative&gt;{{Cite news|first=Line Noer |last=Borrevik |title=Skogstad Aamo ikke ønsket av politikerne |work=Dagens Næringsliv |date=5 March 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aamo belonged to the same political party as [[Minister of Finance (Norway)|Minister of Finance]] [[Sigbjørn Johnsen]] and the rest of Brundtland's Third Cabinet. Since Aamo came directly from a government position, that of state secretary, parliament member [[Lars Gunnar Lie]] cited concern about a perceived lack of distance between the third cabinet Brundtland and the Financial Supervisory Authority. This would put the independence of the latter at odds, he claimed. However, most of the criticism was directed at Sigbjørn Johnsen, who at that time was under scrutiny for his involvement with private corporation [[Storebrand|UNI Storebrand]]. The Financial Supervisory Authority would have a role in this scrutiny, and several people, including parliament member [[Kristin Halvorsen]], asked for the appointment of Johnsen's party fellow be postponed until after the case was closed. Parliament member [[Carl I. Hagen]] called for Johnsen to resign.&lt;ref name="negative"/&gt; On the other hand, conservative newspaper ''[[Aftenposten]]'' defended the decision in an op-ed the next day, citing Aamo's strong qualifications for the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first= |last= |title=Omstridt, men vel kvalifisert |work=Aftenposten |date=6 March 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism did not hinder the appointment of Aamo, and Sigbjørn Johnsen remained in his seat.

Aamo applied for the position as [[Norges Bank#List of Central Bank Governors|Governor]] of the [[Norges Bank|Central Bank of Norway]] in 1999, but [[Svein Gjedrem]] was appointed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|agency=Norwegian News Agency |title=Jakt på Statoil-sjef og Børs-sjef |url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=7149736 |date=9 August 1999 |accessdate=12 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[economic crisis of 2008]], Aamo stated that banks are safer in Norway than in any other country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author= |title=Vil ha kraftigere lut |url=http://www.orapp.no/bors_og_aksjetips/20081010/vil_ha_kraftigere_lut/ |work=Økonomisk Rapport |date=10 October 2008 |accessdate=12 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014055816/http://www.orapp.no/bors_og_aksjetips/20081010/vil_ha_kraftigere_lut/ |archivedate=14 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The matters are complicated by Norway's close relations to Iceland, whose [[2008–2012 Icelandic financial crisis|national crisis]] had consequences for Norwegian customers in the banks [[Glitnir Bank|Glitnir]] and [[Kaupthing Bank|Kaupthing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author= |title=Redder norske sparepenger i islandske krisebanker |url=http://www.aftenbladet.no/innenriks/926521/Redder_norske_sparepenger__i_islandske_krisebanker.html |work=Stavanger Aftenblad |date=10 October 2008 |accessdate=12 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011074644/http://www.aftenbladet.no/innenriks/926521/Redder_norske_sparepenger__i_islandske_krisebanker.html |archivedate=11 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aamo is himself a board member of the [[Norwegian Banks' Guarantee Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bankenessikringsfond.no/no/hoved/om-oss/styre/|title=Styre|date=|publisher=Norwegian Banks' Guarantee Fund|language=Norwegian|accessdate=20 November 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218230817/http://www.bankenessikringsfond.no/no/hoved/om-oss/styre/|archive-date=18 December 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carbone lewis.svg|thumb|100px|The [[Lewis structure]] of a [[carbon]] atom, showing its four [[valence electrons]]]]

[[Carbon]] is a key component of all known [[life]] on [[Earth]], representing approximately 45-50% of all dry biomass.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fao.org/forestry/17111/en/&lt;/ref&gt; Complex [[molecule]]s are made up of [[carbon]] [[chemical bond|bonded]] with other [[chemical element|elements]], especially [[oxygen]] and [[hydrogen]] and frequently also with [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]] and [[sulfur]]. Carbon is abundant on Earth. It is also lightweight and relatively small in size, making it easier for enzymes to manipulate carbon molecules.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} It is frequently assumed in [[astrobiology]] that if life exists elsewhere in the [[universe]], it will also be carbon-based.&lt;ref name=BC&gt;{{cite web | url = http://biocab.org/Astrobiology.html | title = Astrobiology | accessdate = 2011-01-17 | date = September 26, 2006 | publisher = Biology Cabinet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C003763/index.php?page=interview07 |title=Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons: An Interview With Dr. Farid Salama |accessdate=2008-10-20 |year=2000 |work=Astrobiology magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620075201/http://library.thinkquest.org/C003763/index.php?page=interview07 |archivedate=2008-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics refer to this assumption as [[carbon chauvinism]].&lt;ref name =darling&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/C/carbon-based_life.html |title=Carbon-based life |accessdate=14 September 2007 |first=David|last=Darling |publisher=Encyclopedia of Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Carbon forms a vast number of [[chemical compound|compounds]], more than any other element, with almost ten million compounds described to date,&lt;ref name=lanl&gt;"There are close to ten million known carbon compounds, many thousands of which are vital to organic and life processes." {{cite web|author=Chemistry Operations|date=December 15, 2003|url=http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/6.html|title=Carbon|publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory|accessdate=2008-10-09|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913063402/http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/6.html |archivedate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and yet that number is but a fraction of the number of theoretically possible compounds under standard conditions. For this reason, carbon has often been referred to as the "king of the elements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Deming |first=Anna |date=2010 |title=King of the elements? |journal=Nanotechnology |volume=21 |issue=30 |pages=300201 |doi=10.1088/0957-4484/21/30/300201 |pmid=20664156 |bibcode=2010Nanot..21D0201D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon is the 15th [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|most abundant element in the Earth's crust]], and the [[Abundance of the chemical elements|fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass]] after [[hydrogen]], [[helium]], and [[oxygen]]. Carbon's abundance, its unique diversity of [[organic compound]]s, and its unusual ability to form [[polymer]]s at the temperatures commonly encountered on [[Earth]] enables this element to serve as a common element of all known life. It is the second most abundant element in the [[human body]] by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Campbell Biology|last=Reece|first=Jane B.|date=31 October 2013|publisher=[[Pearson Education|Pearson]]|isbn=9780321775658|edition=10|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"What we normally think of as 'life' is based on chains of carbon atoms, with a few other atoms, such as nitrogen or phosphorus", per [[Stephen Hawking]] in a 2008 lecture, "carbon [...] has the richest chemistry." &lt;ref name=nasa&gt;{{cite web|author1=Stephen Hawking|title=Life in the Universe, 50th anniversary celebration of NASA|url=http://www.dailygalaxy.com/my_weblog/2011/05/stephen-hawking-on-non-carbon-based-alien-life.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=28 August 2015|date=1 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The most important characteristics of carbon as a basis for the [[chemistry]] of life are, that it has four valence bonds, and that the energy required to make or break a bond is at an appropriate level for building molecules, which are stable and reactive.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Carbon atoms bond readily to other carbon atoms; this allows the building of arbitrarily long complex molecules and [[polymers]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Other candidates==
There are not many other elements which even appear to be promising candidates for supporting life, for example, processes such as [[metabolism]]. The most frequently suggested alternative is [[silicon]].&lt;ref name="Pace"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pace | first1 = NR | title = The universal nature of biochemistry. | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/98/3/805.full.pdf | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 98 | issue = 3 | pages = 805–8 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11158550 | pmc = 33372 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.98.3.805 | bibcode=2001PNAS...98..805P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silicon is in the same group in the [[Periodic Table]] of [[chemical element|elements]], and has four [[valence bond theory|valence bonds]], and bonds to itself, generally in the form of [[crystal lattice]]s rather than long chains.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} It is considerably more electropositive than carbon. Silicon compounds do not readily [[Recombination_(chemistry)|recombine]] into different permutations in a manner that would plausibly support lifelike processes.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

== Key  molecules ==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
The most notable groups of chemicals used in the processes of living organisms include:

* [[Protein]]s, which are the building blocks from which the structures of living organisms are constructed (this includes almost all [[enzyme]]s, which [[catalyst|catalyse]] organic chemical reactions)
* [[Nucleic acid]]s, which carry [[Genetics|genetic]] information
* [[Carbohydrate]]s, which store energy in a form that can be used by living [[cell (biology)|cells]]
* [[Lipid]]s, which also store energy, but in a more concentrated form, and which may be stored for extended periods in the bodies of animals

==Fiction==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
Silicon has been a theme of non-carbon-based-life since it is somewhat similar to carbon in its chemical characteristics.  
In cinematic and literary [[science fiction]], when man-made machines cross from non-living to living, this new form would be an example of non-carbon-based life. Since the advent of the [[microprocessor]] in the late 1960s, these machines are often classed as "silicon-based life". Another example of "silicon-based life" is the episode "The Devil in the Dark" from [[Star Trek: The Original Series]], in which a living rock creature's biochemistry is based on silicon. Also in The X-Files episode "Firewalker" where silicon based organism was discovered in a volcano.

In the [[2010_(film)|movie adaptation of Arthur C. Clarke's "2010" (1984)]] a character argues, "Whether we are based on carbon or on silicon makes no fundamental difference; we should each be treated with appropriate respect"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2010: Quotes|url=https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002895/quotes|website=IMDb|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This quote may be the basis of [[Steve Jobs]]'s quip when he introduced [[Carbon (API)|Carbon within MacOS X]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WWDC '98|url=http://www.noteskey.com/events/1998_05.html|website=NotesKey|date = May 11, 1998|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, "Carbon. All life forms will be based on it."

The '''Coda''' is a group of [[fictional]] female [[warrior]]s in [[Wildstorm]] [[comic book|comics]]. The Coda first appeared in ''[[WildC.A.T.S.]]'' volume 1 #1 (August, 1992) and were created by [[Brandon Choi]] and [[Jim Lee]]. 

==Fictional background==
The Coda are a particular race of all female aliens who live on the planet Khera. They are trained in their own unique form of martial arts. Their weapon of choice is the Clef Blade, a weapon resembling a harpoon or a lance, though they often wield swords or even modern firearms. Coda warriors usually wear red markings on their face.  A sign (usually a circle) on the forehead and stripes on the cheeks) depicting their ranking within the sisterhood. A second class group of Coda warriors of different species have formed on various planets, carrying the blood of original Coda warriors only.

===Khera===
The Coda was founded on the planet Khera, home to the [[Kherubim]]. The Kherubim were a race blessed with longevity, but the downside was that they had become nearly infertile. Childbirth was a great honor and therefore every Kheran had to participate in a ritual in which a Kheran female and a Kheran male had to couple once. Should the female become pregnant and give birth, she would go on to become a priestess. Otherwise she could do with her life as she pleased. [[Zealot (Wildstorm)|Lady Zannah]] had been selected to mate with [[Mister Majestic|Majestros]] and their union did result in childbirth, the child [[Savant (Wildstorm)|Kenesha]]. Zannah, though, loved being a warrior; so her mother, Harmony, proposed a plan: She would tell her people that Zannah's child had died, and would raise Kenesha as her own daughter. Zannah accepted, and Harmony became a figure of legend, the only Kherubim to have given birth to more than one child in ages. This legend was the foundation of the Sisterhood known as the Coda, a completely female [[caste]] of warriors, devoted to the honor of combat. Their male counterpart is known as the Brotherhood of the Sword. Over the millennia, the Coda would grow in power, and at present they are the second largest political faction within Kherubim society. Only the Pantheon is slightly larger. The Coda's headquarters is Zealot's former home, the Tower of Red Lament. Among the Coda on Khera, there is a small cell of elite assassins called the Skein. They have no known counterpart among the Earthborn Coda. The first rule of The Coda is: ''The weapon is the extension of the flesh, the flesh of the mind, the mind of the soul''.

===Earth===
The Kherubim were at war with the [[Daemonite]]s, another spacefaring race. During a ship-to-ship combat, a Kheran and a Daemonite vessel crashlanded on Earth. Both Zannah and Kenesha were on board this vessel. The Kherubim were physically identical to humans and quickly integrated within human society, inspiring tales of superhuman heroes, gods and angels. The Daemonites had the ability to possess human hosts and inspired tales of possession, demons and monsters. Their war continued underground. 

To aid them in their war, Zannah, now called Zealot and two of her fellow Coda generals, Andromache and Artemis, started training human Coda Warriors, giving birth to the myth of the Amazons. They established a hidden Coda city on Mt. Themyscira in [[Greece]]. Kenesha took the name [[Savant (Wildstorm)|Savant]], but had no desire to join the Coda. As the Earthborn sisterhood are not born immortals, the immortal members take part in a ''Blood Dance'' with the newer members worthy of being called Coda Warriors. In the ritual they cut each other in a ritualistic dance and rub each other's wounds, thus mingling the blood, transferring the immortal blood into the non-immortal. The blood of a Kherubim, mingled with a human's during a special ritual, gave the gift of longevity to normal humans and this became an important ritual for Earth's Coda. The Kheran Coda sisterhood have been shown to perform this ritual also, but as they are all immortal, their reasons have more to do with the symbolic than with the need for survival. The Coda's Cleft Blades, both on Khera and on Earth, are considered very sacred to the sisterhood. They are only to be used in a death duel or in their ritual Blood Dance. During a battle near Troy (presumably the [[Trojan War]]), Zealot's actions branded her as a traitor to the rest of the Coda, to be killed on sight. The Coda general Andromache took over the role of [[Majestrix]]. Under her rule the Coda began selling their skills to the highest bidders and became less noble warriors and more power hungry conquerors. They also began establishing smaller Coda bases around the world. Though Mt. Themyscira still proved to be the oldest and most sacred of homes to the Amazons, the Coda have also been shown to reside in a massive island off the coast of Africa which they refer to as the Coda Citadel, as discovered by members of [[Gen¹³]].&lt;ref&gt;''Gen¹³'' (vol. 2), #3-5&lt;/ref&gt;  As Zealot was seen as a traitor to the sisterhood, she became a constant target of The Coda for several centuries.

[[Image:CodaWarrior.JPG|thumb|[[Zealot (Wildstorm)|Zealot]] displays standard Coda weapons, such as the Cleft Blade]]
In the mid 20th century, Zealot trained [[Grifter (comics)|Grifter]] in the fighting style of the Coda, making him the first male Coda. When the Coda discovered this they marked Grifter a target for extermination as they believed the Coda ways are only to be carried by women. By now many Coda were working for the Cabal, an organisation founded by the Daemonites. Zealot, Grifter and Savant all were part of the [[WildC.A.T.s]] and Zealot also eventually trained WildC.A.T.s member [[Voodoo (Wildstorm)|Voodoo]] in the Coda martial arts. The WildC.A.T.s and Coda fought often. The WildC.A.T.s returned once to Khera where Zealot was nearly assassinated by her own Coda Sisters, just to make her a martyr for their cause. Zealot was disgusted with the Sisters betrayal of their ideals and returned to Earth with the other WildC.A.T.s.

Several months later on Earth, Zealot apparently died on a mission causing the WildC.A.T.s to disband. She decided that the actions of the Coda on Earth and on Khera proved that the Coda had become corrupt and decided that the corruption had to be destroyed. She set out to single-handedly erase the Coda from the face of the Earth. She killed all Coda in America she could find, but spared Grifter, because of their shared romantic past. She warned him not to follow her.

Zealot continued her quest in Europe and destroyed most of the Coda there, but was captured by their top agent, The Grand Sarin. Grifter gathered several allies to save her, resulting in a war between his forces and the Coda. In the end, his small group turned out not to be enough, but Grifter called in the help of former WildC.A.T.s member and his current employer, [[Spartan (comics)|Jack Marlowe]], who used his powers to teleport part of the Mediterranean Sea on top of the Coda, drowning many of them. Majestrix Andromache survived and with her surviving troops she faced Grifter and his friends. At the same time FBI-agent Chandler, whose partner had been killed by the Coda, had found the Coda's armory. Chandler detonated the armory, blowing up the entire Coda base. Grifter and his friends were teleported away by Marlowe in time, but Andromache and her soldiers were caught in the blast.

Currently there are only few Earth-born Coda left. Majestrix Andromache was among the Coda fighting Grifter and his allies and died in the explosion. Recently, in the pages of ''Majestic'', [[Mister Majestic]] and Zealot have encountered Kherubim Coda Warriors on Earth. Also the Coda-traitor Charis (known as [[Nemesis (Wildstorm)|Nemesis]]) recently joined forces with the former WildC.A.T.s in the pages of ''Wildcats: Nemesis''. During the ''Wildstorm Armageddon'' story line The few remaining Coda were gathered up by the thought long dead Devin, formerly excommunicated acolyte of their order who survived into obscurity until the end of the world occurred. Gathering up the few remaining Coda survivors of the Post Apocalyptic world to create her own sisterhood, with her as Majestrix, which expanded its numbers through the weary travelers and soccer moms looking for safe respite that only her sect could provide, all while keeping any capable males captured as breeding labor in order to proliferate their ranks; Devin would eventually come into conflict with a past [[Caitlin Fairchild]] and her weathered survivor friends of [[Gen 13]].

==Notable members==
*Andromache, Kheran Majestrix of the Coda on Earth. Presumed dead.
*Artemis, a Kheran general who followed Zealot to Earth.
*Olympia Atreides, WildC.A.T.S. member and possibly the sole [[Daemonite]] Coda.
*Baroness Destine, killed by Zealot.
*Christine Blaze, Agent of [[International Operations]], infiltrated the Coda.
*Cassandra, Coda warrior stationed in the Himalayas. She killed Susanna Chaste and in return was killed by [[Divine Right (comic)|Max Faraday]] using her life-energy to resurrect Susanna. 
*Cordelia, Matriarch of the Coda and ruler of Melanesia. Former ally of [[Team 7]].
*Delphae, the Coda mystic/shaman with the power to open teleportation portals.
*Devin, disfigured assassin charged to capture Voodoo. Thought to have been expired in the second attempt but survives unto the future World's End event as Majestrix of remaining coda.
*The Grand Sarin, Coda assassin in special powered armour. Said to be the best assassin among the Earth-born Coda. Killed by Grifter in [[Ladytron (comics)|Ladytron]]'s body.
*[[Grifter (comics)|Grifter]], sole male Coda.
*Lady Harmony, mother of Lady Zannah and head of the Kheran Coda sect called the Skein. She was killed in battle.
*Sister Maxima is the only known over-weight Coda warrior. She's an earth born Coda and resides at the Coda Citadel off the coast of Africa.
*[[Nemesis (Wildstorm)|Nemesis]] (real name: Charis), a member of the Adrastea class from [[Kherubim|Khera]].
*[[Zealot (Wildstorm)|Zealot]], former Majestrix of the Coda of Earth

Note: both [[Savant (Wildstorm)|Savant]] and [[Voodoo (Wildstorm)|Voodoo]] have had Coda-training, but neither have devoted themselves enough to be considered true Coda warriors.

'''Critterding''' is an artificial life simulator created by Bob Winckelmans and released as open source under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]].

== Simulation ==
Critterding is a 3D/Physics based simulator, in which critters try to survive by developing a form of locomotion, find food and reproduce. Critters are made up of two types of body parts which are linked together by joints. The head, coloured red, is where the vision and mouth is located. The body segments are used for locomotion and display the colour of the critter. On an initial run, random seed critters are generated in a food rich environment, eventually a seed critter is generated that is able to eat and reproduce before dying. The new offspring have a chance to receive a mutation to either the body or neural network, some of which will be detrimental, causing the critter to fail and die while other mutations will be beneficial allowing it and its offspring to flourish over their siblings. Once the critter population reaches a preset maximum, the population is halved and the available food in the system is slightly reduced.

== Vision ==
Critters see with a 16 x 16 retina grid by default, though this value may be changed. Each pixel in the grid is able to see red, green, blue and alpha channels.

== Environment ==
Critterding supports 2 main environment types. A tray/petri dish style flatworld with walls to keep critters from falling into the void and the roundworld environment where critters and food are held on with planet like gravity. Beta 14 introduces .obj loading for fully customisable terrain, critter and food skins, skydome and dynamic lighting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5232">'''Delta 6 desaturase''' (D6D or Δ-6-desaturase) is a [[desaturase]] enzyme that converts between types of fatty acids (termed ''6'' after [[omega-6 fatty acids]]), which are [[essential fatty acids|essential]] nutrients in the human body.  The enzyme is molecularly identical across all living things (preserved across [[Kingdom (biology)]]) it is present in animals, plants, and [[cyanobacteria]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee JM, Lee H, Kang S, Park WJ | title = Fatty Acid Desaturases, Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Regulation, and Biotechnological Advances | journal = Nutrients | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 23 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26742061 | pmc = 4728637 | doi = 10.3390/nu8010023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nakamura"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakamura MT, Nara TY | title = Structure, function, and dietary regulation of delta6, delta5, and delta9 desaturases | journal = Annual Review of Nutrition | volume = 24 | pages = 345–76 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15189125 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.nutr.24.121803.063211 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   

D6D is one of the 3 [[fatty acid desaturase]]s present in humans along with Δ-5 and [[Delta-9 desaturase|Δ-9]], named so because it was thought to convert only [[omega-6]] fatty acids, but actually converts some others also, and is obligatory to build the longer chain [[omega-3 fatty acids]] from other simpler fatty acids in humans {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}.  In humans, it is encoded by the [[FADS2]] gene {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}.

==Molecular activity==
D6D is an [[desaturase]] enzyme, i.e. introduces a double bond in a specific position of long-chain fatty acids.  Among them, it converts between various forms of [[Omega-3]] and [[Omega-6]] fatty acids{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}:
* primarily (in humans):
** cis-[[linoleic acid]] to [[gamma-linolenic acid]] (GLA)
** [[Palmitic acid]] to [[Sapienic acid]]
* less efficiently in humans:
** [[alpha-Linolenic acid|ALA]] to [[Stearidonic acid]], along with an [[elongase]] to provide EPA. 
** Tetracosatetranoic acid to tetracosapentanoic acid, an intermediate step between EPA to DHA synthesis.

D6D is obligatory along with various [[elongase]]s to convert to longer chain omega-3's, such as between ALA to EPA as well as EPA to [[Docosahexanoic acid|DHA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Dharmendra Kumar | last = Meena | name-list-format = vanc | title = HUFA and PUFA: Structures, Occurrence, Biochemistry And Their Health Benefits | url = http://aquafind.com/articles/HUFA-and-PUFA.php | work = Aquafind Aquatic Fish Database }} &lt;/ref&gt;

GLA deficiencies in animals including humans have shown wide effects down the line -- [[Dihomo-γ-linolenic acid|Dihomogamma-linolenic acid]] (DGLA) and [[Prostaglandin E1]] deficiency.  PGE1 activates [[T lymphocytes]], inhibits smooth muscle proliferation and thrombosis, is important in gonadal function and raises [[cyclic AMP]] levels in many tissues. It is a good candidate for a key factor lost in aging.&lt;ref name=pmid6270521/&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}  It also affects viability of [[sperm]].&lt;ref name="ncbi2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roqueta-Rivera M, Stroud CK, Haschek WM, Akare SJ, Segre M, Brush RS, Agbaga MP, Anderson RE, Hess RA, Nakamura MT | title = Docosahexaenoic acid supplementation fully restores fertility and spermatogenesis in male delta-6 desaturase-null mice | journal = Journal of Lipid Research | volume = 51 | issue = 2 | pages = 360–7 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 19690334 | pmc = 2803238 | doi = 10.1194/jlr.M001180 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[dermatitis]].&lt;ref name="ncbi2010"/&gt;

==Variability==
Levels of D6D rapidly fall rapidly in the testes and more slowly in the liver in aging rats.&lt;ref name=pmid6270521&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Horrobin DF | title = Loss of delta-6-desaturase activity as a key factor in aging | journal = [[Medical Hypotheses]] | volume = 7 | issue = 9 | pages = 1211–20 | date = September 1981 | pmid = 6270521 | doi = 10.1016/0306-9877(81)90064-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}  D6D is a long chain [[PUFA]] rate limiter, has greater affinity for ALA than for linoleic acid, nevertheless many diets have far more linoleic acid present, resulting in reduced levels of [[alpha-Linolenic acid]] to [[Eicosapentaenoic acid|EPA]] conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Mardi A. | last = Parelman | name-list-format = vanc | journal =  Today's Dietitian | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 14  | date = May 2015 | url = http://www.todaysdietitian.com/newarchives/050515p14.shtml | title = Omegas: Dissecting the Science on Omega-3 Supplements }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women tend to have higher levels of D6D due to the effects of [[estrogen]] {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}.

==Inhibiting factors==
* alcohol, radiation, diabetes
* lack of zinc, pyridoxine, ascorbic acid, the pineal hormone, melatonin, and possibly vitamin B3.&lt;ref name=pmid6270521/&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12815">'''Digital immortality''' (or "'''virtual immortality'''") is the hypothetical concept of storing (or transferring) a person's personality in more durable media, i.e., a computer.

A considerable portion of [[transhumanists]] and [[singularitarians]] place great hope into the belief that they may become [[Immortality|immortal]] by the year 2045,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cohan|first1=Peter|title=Google's Engineering Director: 32 Years To Digital Immortality|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2013/06/20/googles-engineering-director-32-years-to-digital-immortality/|accessdate=7 June 2015|date=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; by creating one or many non-biological functional copies of their brains, thereby leaving their "biological shell". These copies may then "live eternally" in a version of digital "heaven" or paradise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lewis|first1=Tanya|title=The Singularity Is Near: Mind Uploading by 2045?|url=http://www.livescience.com/37499-immortality-by-2045-conference.html|website=livescience.com|accessdate=7 June 2015|date=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Strickland|first1=Jonathan|title=How Digital Immortality Works|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/gadgets/high-tech-gadgets/digital-immortality.htm|website=howstuffworks.com|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The realism of the concept ==
The [[National Science Foundation]] has awarded a half-million-dollar grant to the universities of Central Florida at Orlando and Illinois at Chicago to explore how researchers might use [[artificial intelligence]], archiving, and computer imaging to create convincing, digital versions of real people, a possible first step toward virtual immortality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bioethics.com/?p=2717 US Government funds virtual reality research], bioethics.com, 14 June 2007 &lt;/ref&gt;

The Digital Immortality Institute explores three factors necessary for digital immortality. First, at whatever level of implementation, avatars require guaranteed [[Internet]] accessibility. Next, avatars must be what users specify, and they must remain so. Finally, future representations must be secured before the living users are no more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digital-immortality.org/whatis.html |title=What is Digital Immortality? |publisher=Digital-immortality.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of [[Dmitry Itskov]]'s [[2045 Initiative]] is to "create technologies enabling the transfer of an individual’s personality to a non-biological carrier, and extending existence, including to the point of immortality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eördögh|first1=Fruzsina|title=Russian Billionaire Dmitry Itskov Plans on Becoming Immortal by 2045|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/russian-billionaire-dmitry-itskov-plans-on-becoming-immortal-by-2045|accessdate=7 June 2015|date=7 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524041430/http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/russian-billionaire-dmitry-itskov-plans-on-becoming-immortal-by-2045|archivedate=24 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==
Reaching digital immortality is a two-step process:
#  archiving and [[digitizing]] people,
#  making the avatar live

=== Archiving and digitizing people ===
According to [[Gordon Bell]] and [[Jim Gray (computer scientist)|Jim Gray]] from [[Microsoft Research]], retaining every conversation that a person has ever heard is already realistic: it needs less than a [[terabyte]] of [[computer data storage|storage]] (for adequate quality).&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/69927/tr-2000-101.pdf Digital Immortality], by Gordon Bell and Jim Gray, Microsoft Research&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bainbridge|first1=William Sims|title=Personality Capture and Emulation|date=November 2013|isbn=978-1-4471-5604-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hiq8BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=digital+immortality}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[speech recognition|speech]] or [[optical character recognition|text recognition]] technologies are one of the biggest challenges of the concept.

A second possibility would be to archive and analyze social Internet use to map the personality of people. By analyzing social Internet use during 50 years, it would be possible to model a society's culture, a society's way of thinking, and a society's interests.

Rothblatt envisions the creation of "mindfiles" – collections of data from all kinds of sources, including the photos we upload to Facebook, the discussions and opinions we share on forums or blogs, and other social media interactions that reflect our life experiences and our unique self.&lt;ref name="vhum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esc"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Desat|first1=Marla|title=Would You Clone Your Mind to Live Forever? Virtually Human|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/scienceandtech/12297-Review-Maxime-Rothblatt-s-Virtually-Human-Digital-Immortality|publisher=The Escapist|accessdate=7 June 2015|date=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Grandmorin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/soon_immortal |title=soon immortal (@soon_immortal) op Twitter |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; summarized the concept of digital immortality by the following equation: "semantic analysis + social internet use + Artificial Intelligence = immortality".

Some find that photos, videos, soundclips, social media posts and other data of oneself could already be regarded as such an archiving.&lt;ref name="sterkul"&gt;{{cite book|title=Computertechnik und Sterbekultur|isbn=978-3-643-11071-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=chnMBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=caprica+digital+immortality|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vhum"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McQuade|first1=Zan|title=What happens to us on the internet when we die?|url=https://theweek.com/articles/554466/what-happens-internet-when-die|publisher=The Week|accessdate=7 June 2015|date=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="esc"/&gt;

Susanne Asche states:
{{pull quote|text=As a hopefully minimalistic definition then, digital immortality can be roughly considered as involving a person-centric repository containing a copy of everything that a person sees, hears, says, or engenders over his or her lifespan, including photographs, videos, audio recordings, movies, television shows, music albums/CDs, newspapers, documents, diaries and journals, interviews, meetings, love letters, notes, papers, art pieces, and so on, and so on; and if not everything, then at least as much as the person has and takes the time and trouble to include. The person’s personality, emotion profiles, thoughts, beliefs, and appearance are also captured and integrated into an artificially intelligent, interactive, con-versational agent/avatar. This avatar is placed in charge of (and perhaps "equated" with) the collected material in the repository so that the agent can present the illusion of having the factual memories, thoughts, and beliefs of the person him/herself.|author=Susanne Asche|source=Kulturelles Gedächtnis im 21. Jahrhundert: Tagungsband des internationalen Symposiums, Digital Immortality &amp; Runaway Technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Asche|first1=Susanne|title=Kulturelles Gedächtnis im 21. Jahrhundert: Tagungsband des internationalen Symposiums|date=23 April 2005|publisher=KIT Scientific Publishing|url=http://digbib.ubka.uni-karlsruhe.de/volltexte/documents/3296701|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Making the avatar alive ===
{{unclear|date=March 2016}}

Defining the avatar to be alive allows it to communicate with the future in the sense that it continues to learn, evolve and interact with people, if they still exist. Technically, the operation exists to implement an artificial intelligence system to the avatar.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} This artificial intelligence system is then assumed to think and will react on the base of the archive.

Rothblatt proposes the term "mindware" for software that is being developed with the goal of generating conscious AIs. Such software would read a person's "mindfile" to generate a "mindclone." Rothblatt also proposes a certain level of governmental approval for mindware, like an FDA certification, to ensure that the resulting mindclones are well made.&lt;ref name="vhum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esc"/&gt;

=== Calibration process ===

An '''energy being''' or '''astral being''' is a theoretical [[life form]] that is composed of [[energy]] rather than [[matter]]. They appear in [[myth]]s/[[legend]]s, [[paranormal]]/[[UFO]] accounts, and in various works of [[speculative fiction]].

Energy beings are typically rendered as a translucent glowing fluid or as a collection of flames or electrical sparks or bolts; somewhat in common with the representations of [[ghost]]s.

Energy beings have a variety of capacities. The Taelons (from ''[[Earth: Final Conflict]]'') are barely more powerful than mortals, while others such as ''[[Star Trek]]''{{'}}s [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]], ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''{{'}}s Ascended Ancients/Ori, ''[[Ben 10: Alien Force]]''{{'}}s [[List of Ben 10 characters#Verdona Tennyson|Anodites]], or the Meekrob from ''[[Invader Zim]]'' possess god-like powers.

In [[philosophy]], '''essence''' is the property or set of properties that make an entity or [[substance theory|substance]] what it fundamentally is, and which it has by [[metaphysical necessity|necessity]], and without which it loses its [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]]. Essence is contrasted with [[accident (philosophy)|accident]]: a property that the entity or substance has [[metaphysical contingency|contingently]], without which the substance can still retain its identity.  The concept originates rigorously with Aristotle (although it can also be found in Plato)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/euthyfro.html|title=The Internet Classics Archive {{!}} Euthyphro by Plato|website=classics.mit.edu|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;, who used the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] expression ''to ti ên einai'' (τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι,&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', 1029b&lt;/ref&gt; literally meaning "the what it was to be" and corresponding to the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] term [[quiddity]]) or sometimes the shorter phrase ''to ti esti'' (τὸ τί ἐστι,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'', 1030a&lt;/ref&gt; literally meaning "the what it is" and corresponding to the scholastic term [[haecceity]]) for the same idea. This phrase presented such difficulties for its Latin translators that they coined the word ''essentia'' (English "essence") to represent the whole expression. For Aristotle and his scholastic followers, the notion of essence is closely linked to that of definition (ὁρισμός ''[[horismos]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-metaphysicys/ S. Marc Cohen, "Aristotle's Metaphysics"], [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], accessed 20 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the history of western thought, essence has often served as a vehicle for doctrines that tend to individuate different forms of existence as well as different identity conditions for objects and properties; in this logical meaning, the concept has given a strong theoretical and common-sense basis to the whole family of logical theories based on the "possible worlds" analogy set up by [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] and developed in the intensional logic from [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]] to [[Saul Kripke|Kripke]], which was later challenged by "extensionalist" philosophers such as [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]].

==Ontological status&lt;!--Linked from 'Étienne Gilson'--&gt;==
In his dialogues [[Plato]] suggests that concrete beings acquire their essence through their relations to "[[Theory of Forms|Forms]]"{{mdash}}abstract universals logically or ontologically separate from the objects of sense perception. These Forms are often put forth as the models or paradigms  of which sensible things are "copies". When used in this sense, the word form is often capitalized.&lt;ref&gt;"Chapter 28: Form" of ''The Great Ideas: A Synopticon of Great Books of the Western World'' (Vol. II). ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (1952), p. 526-542. This source states that Form or Idea get capitalized according to this convention when they refer "to that which is separate from the characteristics of material things and from the ideas in our mind."&lt;/ref&gt; Sensible bodies are in constant flux and imperfect and hence, by Plato's reckoning, less real than the Forms which are eternal, unchanging and complete. Typical examples of Forms given by Plato are largeness, smallness, equality, unity, goodness, beauty and justice.

[[Aristotle]] moves the Forms of Plato to the nucleus of the individual thing, which is called ''[[ousia]]'' or substance. Essence is the ''ti'' of the thing, the ''[[to ti en einai]]''. Essence corresponds to the ''ousia'''s definition; essence is a real and physical aspect of the ''ousia'' (Aristotle, ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', I).

According to [[nominalists]] ([[Roscelin of Compiègne]], [[William of Ockham]], [[Bernard of Chartres]]), universals aren't concrete entities, just voice's sounds; there are only individuals: "''nam cum habeat eorum sententia nihil esse praeter individuum [...]''" (Roscelin, ''De gener. et spec.'', 524). Universals are words that can to call several individuals; for example the word "homo". Therefore, a universal is reduced to a sound's emission (Roscelin, ''De generibus et speciebus'').

[[John Locke]] distinguished between "real essences" and "nominal essences". Real essences are the thing(s) that makes a thing a thing, whereas nominal essences are our conception of what makes a thing a thing.&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/real-essence/&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Edmund Husserl]] essence is ''ideal''. However, ''ideal'' means that essence is an intentional object of consciousness. Essence is interpreted as ''sense'' (E. Husserl, ''Ideas pertaining to a pure phenomenology and to a phenomenological philosophy'', paragraphs 3 and 4).

==Existentialism==
{{main|Meaning (existential)}}
[[Existentialism]] was coined by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s endorsement of [[Martin Heidegger|Martin Heidegger's]] statement that for human beings "[[existence precedes essence]]."  In as much as "essence" is a cornerstone of all [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] philosophy and of [[Rationalism]], Sartre's statement was a repudiation of the philosophical system that had come before him (and, in particular, that of [[Husserl]], [[Hegel]], and [[Heidegger]]).  Instead of "is-ness" generating "actuality," he argued that existence and actuality come first, and the essence is derived afterward. For [[Kierkegaard]], it is the individual person who is the supreme moral entity, and the personal, subjective aspects of human life that are the most important; also, for Kierkegaard all of this had religious implications.&lt;ref&gt;''The Story of Philosophy'', Bryan Magee, Dorling Kindersley Lond. 1998, {{ISBN|0-7513-0590-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In metaphysics==
"Essence," in metaphysics, is often synonymous with the [[soul]], and some existentialists argue that individuals gain their souls and spirits after they exist, that they develop their souls and spirits during their lifetimes.  For Kierkegaard, however, the emphasis was upon essence as "nature."  For him, there is no such thing as "human nature" that determines how a human will behave or what a human will be.  First, he or she exists, and then comes property.  [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s more materialist and skeptical existentialism furthered this existentialist tenet by flatly refuting any metaphysical essence, any soul, and arguing instead that there is merely existence, with attributes as essence.

Thus, in existentialist discourse, essence can refer to physical aspect or property to the ongoing being of a person (the character or internally determined goals), or to the infinite inbound within the human (which can be lost, can atrophy, or can be developed into an equal part with the finite), depending upon the type of existentialist discourse.

==Marxism's essentialism==

[[Karl Marx]] was a follower of [[Hegel]]'s thought, and he, too, developed a philosophy in reaction to his master. In his early work, Marx used [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] style [[teleology]] and derived a concept of humanity's essential nature. Marx's [[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]] describe [[Marx's theory of alienation|a theory of alienation]] based on human existence being completely different from human essence.  Marx said human nature was social, and that humanity had the distinct essence of free activity and conscious thought.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Some scholars, such as Philip Kain, have argued that Marx abandoned the idea of a human essence, but many other scholars point to Marx's continued discussion of these ideas despite the decline of terms such as essence and alienation in his later work.

==Buddhism==
Within the [[Madhyamaka]] school of [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhism]], [[Candrakirti]] identifies the [[Atman (Buddhism)|self]] as:{{quote|an essence of things that does not depend on others; it is an intrinsic nature. The non-existence of that is [[Anatta|selflessness]].| {{IAST|'''Bodhisattvayogacaryācatuḥśatakaṭikā'''}} 256.1.7&lt;ref name="Lam Rim"&gt;Translations from "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment", Vol. 3 by Tsong-Kha-Pa, Snow Lion Publications {{ISBN|1-55939-166-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Buddhapālita]] adds, while commenting on [[Nagarjuna|Nagārjuna]]'s [[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]], {{quote|What is the reality of things just as it is? It is the absence of essence. Unskilled persons whose eye of intelligence is obscured by the darkness of delusion conceive of an essence of things and then generate attachment and hostility with regard to them.|{{IAST|''Buddhapālita-mula-madhyamaka-vrtti''}}, P5242, 73.5.6-74.1.2&lt;ref name="Lam Rim"/&gt;}}

For the [[Madhyamaka]] Buddhists, '[[Shunyata|Emptiness]]' (also known as [[Anatta|Anatta or Anatman]]) is the strong assertion that all phenomena are empty of any essence, and that anti-essentialism lies at the root of Buddhist praxis and it is the innate belief in essence that is considered to be an afflictive obscuration which serves as the root of [[Samsara|all suffering]]. However, the [[Madhyamaka]] also rejects the tenets of [[Idealism]], [[Materialism]] or [[Cārvāka#No life after death|Nihilism]]; instead, the ideas of ''truth'' or ''existence'', along with any assertions that depend upon them are limited to their function within the contexts and conventions that assert them, possibly somewhat akin to [[Relativism]] or [[Pragmatism]]. For the [[Madhyamaka]], replacement paradoxes such as [[Ship of Theseus]] are answered by stating that the Ship of Theseus remains so (within the conventions that assert it) until it ceases to function as the Ship of Theseus.

In [[Nagarjuna]]'s [[Mulamadhyamakakarika]] Chapter XV examines essence itself.

==Hinduism==

In understanding any individual personality, a distinction is made between one's ''Swadharma'' (essence) and ''Swabhava'' (mental habits and conditionings of ego personality). Svabhava is the nature of a person, which is a result of his or her samskaras (impressions created in the mind due to one's interaction with the external world). These samskaras create habits and mental models and those become our nature. While there is another kind of svabhava that is a pure internal quality — [[Simran (Sanskrit word)|smarana]] — we are here focusing only on the svabhava that was created due to samskaras (because to discover the pure, internal svabhava and smarana, one should become aware of one's samskaras and take control over them). [[Dharma]] is derived from the root ''dhr'' "to hold." It is that which holds an entity together. That is, Dharma is that which gives integrity to an entity and holds the core quality and identity (essence), form and function of that entity. Dharma is also defined as righteousness and duty. To do one's dharma is to be righteous, to do one's dharma is to do one's duty (express one's essence).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prasadkaipa.com/blog/archives/2005/07/svabhava_and_sv.php Prasadkaipa.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Solomon 1974, pp. 1"&gt;Robert C.

== Etymology ==
The term "existentialism" (French: ''L'existentialisme'') was coined by the [[Roman Catholicism in France|French Catholic]] philosopher [[Gabriel Marcel]] in the mid-1940s.&lt;ref&gt;D.E. Cooper ''Existentialism: A Reconstruction'' (Basil Blackwell, 1990, p. 1)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas R. Flynn 2006, page 89"&gt;Thomas R. Flynn, ''Existentialism: A Very Short Introduction'' (Oxford University Press), 2006, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christine Daigle 2006, page 5"&gt;Christine Daigle, ''Existentialist Thinkers and Ethics'' (McGill-Queen's press, 2006, p. 5)&lt;/ref&gt; At first, when Marcel applied the term to him at a colloquium in 1945, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] rejected it.&lt;ref&gt;
Ann Fulton, Apostles of Sartre: Existentialism in America, 1945–1963 (Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 1999) 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Sartre subsequently changed his mind and, on October 29, 1945, publicly adopted the existentialist label in a lecture to the ''Club Maintenant'' in [[Paris]]. The lecture was published as ''[[L'existentialisme est un humanisme]]'' (''[[Existentialism is a Humanism]]''), a short book that did much to popularize existentialist thought.&lt;ref&gt;''L'Existentialisme est un Humanisme'' (Editions Nagel, 1946); ''English'' Jean-Paul Sartre, ''Existentialism and Humanism'' (Eyre Methuen, 1948)&lt;/ref&gt; Marcel later came to reject the label himself in favour of the term Neo-Socratic, in honor of Kierkegaard's essay "On The Concept of Irony".

Some scholars argue that the term should be used only to refer to the cultural movement in Europe in the 1940s and 1950s associated with the works of the philosophers [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], and [[Albert Camus]].&lt;ref name="Crowell-SEoP"/&gt; Other scholars extend the term to Kierkegaard, and yet others extend it as far back as [[Socrates]].&lt;ref&gt;Crowell, Steven. ''The Cambridge Companion to Existentialism'', Cambridge, 2011, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term is often identified with the philosophical views of Jean-Paul Sartre.&lt;ref name="Crowell-SEoP"/&gt;

==Definitional issues and background==
The labels ''existentialism'' and ''existentialist'' are often seen as historical conveniences in as far as they were first applied to many philosophers in hindsight, long after they had died. In fact, while existentialism is generally considered to have originated with Kierkegaard, the first prominent existentialist philosopher to adopt the term as a self-description was [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. Sartre posits the idea that "what all existentialists have in common is the fundamental doctrine that [[existence precedes essence]]", as scholar [[Frederick Copleston]] explains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Existentialism | journal = Philosophy | first = F.C. | last = Copleston | volume = 23 | issue = 84 | pages = 19–37 | jstor = 4544850 | doi = 10.1017/S0031819100065955 | year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to philosopher [[Steven Crowell]], defining existentialism has been relatively difficult, and he argues that it is better [[understanding|understood]] as a general approach used to reject certain systematic philosophies rather than as a systematic philosophy itself.&lt;ref name="Crowell-SEoP"/&gt; Sartre himself, in a lecture delivered in 1945, described existentialism as "the attempt to draw all the consequences from a position of consistent [[atheism]]".&lt;ref&gt;See [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]]'s introduction to {{Cite book |last = Sartre |first = Jean-Paul |year = 2000 |title = Nausea |location = London |publisher = [[Penguin Classics]] |isbn = 978-0-141-18549-1 }} Quote on p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CGbBbtDOZbwC&amp;pg=PT5 vii].&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many outside [[Scandinavia]] consider the term existentialism to have originated from Kierkegaard himself{{who|date=May 2018}}, it is more likely that Kierkegaard adopted this term (or at least the term "existential" as a description of his philosophy) from the Norwegian poet and literary critic [[Johan Sebastian Cammermeyer Welhaven]].&lt;ref&gt;Tidsskrift for Norsk Psykologforening, Vol 45, nummer 10, 2008, side 1298–1304, [http://www.psykologtidsskriftet.no/index.php?seks_id=61613&amp;a=2 Welhaven og psykologien: Del 2. Welhaven peker fremover] (in Norwegian)&lt;/ref&gt; This assertion comes from two sources. The Norwegian philosopher Erik Lundestad refers to the Danish philosopher Fredrik Christian Sibbern. Sibbern is supposed to have had two conversations in 1841, the first with Welhaven and the second with Kierkegaard. It is in the first conversation that it is believed that Welhaven came up with "a word that he said covered a certain thinking, which had a close and positive attitude to life, a relationship he described as existential".&lt;ref&gt;Lundestad, 1998, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; This was then brought to Kierkegaard by Sibbern.

The second claim comes from the Norwegian historian [[Rune Slagstad]], who claims to prove that Kierkegaard himself said the term "existential" was borrowed from the poet. He strongly believes that it was Kierkegaard himself who said that "[[Hegelianism|Hegelians]] do not study philosophy 'existentially'; to use a phrase by Welhaven from one time when I spoke with him about philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;Slagstad, 2001, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concepts ==

=== Existence precedes essence ===
{{Main|Existence precedes essence}}

Sartre claimed that a central proposition of Existentialism is that ''existence precedes [[essence]]'', which means that the most important consideration for individuals is that they are individuals—independently acting and responsible, conscious beings ("existence")—rather than what labels, roles, stereotypes, definitions, or other preconceived categories the individuals fit ("essence"). The actual life of the individuals is what constitutes what could be called their "true essence" instead of there being an arbitrarily attributed essence others use to define them. Thus, human beings, through their own [[consciousness]], create their own values and determine a meaning to their life.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} (Dictionary) "L'existencialisme" – see "l'identité de la personne"&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was Sartre who explicitly coined the phrase, similar notions can be found in the thought of existentialist philosophers such as [[Heidegger]], and [[Kierkegaard]]:

{{Quotation|"The subjective ''thinker’s form'', the form of his communication, is his ''style''. His form must be just as manifold as are the opposites that he holds together. The systematic ''eins, zwei, drei'' is an abstract form that also must inevitably run into trouble whenever it is to be applied to the concrete. To the same degree as the subjective thinker is concrete, to the same degree his form must also be concretely dialectical. But just as he himself is not a poet, not an ethicist, not a dialectician, so also his form is none of these directly. His form must first and last be related to existence, and in this regard he must have at his disposal the poetic, the ethical, the dialectical, the religious. Subordinate character, setting, etc., which belong to the well-balanced character of the esthetic production, are in themselves breadth; the subjective thinker has only one setting—existence—and has nothing to do with localities and such things. The setting is not the fairyland of the imagination, where poetry produces consummation, nor is the setting laid in England, and historical accuracy is not a concern. The setting is inwardness in existing as a human being; the concretion is the relation of the existence-categories to one another. Historical accuracy and historical actuality are breadth." Søren Kierkegaard (Concluding Postscript, Hong pp. 357–58)}}

Some interpret the imperative to define oneself as meaning that anyone can wish to be anything. However, an existentialist philosopher would say such a wish constitutes an inauthentic existence - what Sartre would call '[[bad faith (existentialism)|bad faith]]'. Instead, the phrase should be taken to say that people are (1) defined only insofar as they act and (2) that they are responsible for their actions. For example, someone who acts cruelly towards other people is, by that act, defined as a cruel person. Furthermore, by this action of cruelty, such persons are themselves responsible for their new identity (cruel persons). This is as opposed to their genes, or ''human nature'', bearing the blame.

As Sartre says in his lecture ''[[Existentialism is a Humanism]]'': "... man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world—and defines himself afterwards". The more positive, therapeutic aspect of this is also implied: A person can choose to act in a different way, and to be a good person instead of a cruel person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baird |first=Forrest E. |authorlink= |author2=Walter Kaufmann |title=From Plato to Derrida |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |year=2008 |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |pages= |url= |doi= |isbn=0-13-158591-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sartre's definition of existentialism was based on Heidegger's magnum opus ''[[Being and Time]]''. In the correspondence with [[Jean Beaufret]] later published as the ''[[Letter on Humanism]]'', Heidegger implies that Sartre misunderstood him for his own purposes of subjectivism, and that he did not mean that actions take precedence over being so long as those actions were not reflected upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/26355951|title=Basic Writings: From Being and Time (1927) to The Task of Thinking (1964)|last=Heidegger|first=Martin|publisher=Harper San Francisco|others=Edited by David Farrell Krell|year=1993|isbn=0060637633|edition=Revised and expanded|location=San Francisco, California|pages=|oclc=26355951}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger commented that "the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement", meaning that he thought Sartre had simply switched the roles traditionally attributed to essence and existence without interrogating these concepts and their history in the way that Heidegger claimed to have done.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/26355951|title=Basic Writings: From Being and Time (1927) to The Task of thinking (1964)|last=Heidegger|first=Martin|publisher=Harper San Francisco|others=Edited by David Farrell Krell|year=1993|isbn=0060637633|edition=Revised and expanded|location=San Francisco, California|pages=243|oclc=26355951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Absurd ===
{{Main|Absurdism}}

The notion of the [[Absurdism|Absurd]] contains the idea that there is no meaning in the world beyond what meaning we give it. This meaninglessness also encompasses the amorality or "unfairness" of the world. This conceptualization can be highlighted in the way it opposes the traditional [[Abrahamic religions|Judeo-Christian-Islamic]] perspective, which establishes that life's purpose is about the fulfillment of God's commandments.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Existentialism: A Beginner's Guide|last=Wartenberg|first=Thomas|publisher=One World|year=2008|isbn=9781780740201|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a purpose is what gives meaning to people's lives. To live the life of the absurd means rejecting a life that finds or pursues specific meaning for man's existence since there is nothing to be discovered. According to Albert Camus, the world or the human being is not in itself absurd. The concept only emerges through the [[juxtaposition]] of the two, where life becomes absurd due to the incompatibility between human beings and the world they inhabit.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This view constitutes one of the two interpretations of the absurd in existentialist literature. The second view, which was first elaborated by  [[Søren Kierkegaard]], holds that absurdity is limited to actions and choices of human beings. These are considered absurd since they issue from human freedom, undermining their foundation outside of themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The A to Z of Existentialism|last=Michelman|first=Stephen|publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc.|year=2010|isbn=9780810875890|location=Lanham, Maryland|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of the absurd in existentialism  contrasts with the claim that "bad things don't happen to good people"; to the world, metaphorically speaking, there is no such thing as a good person or a bad person; what happens happens, and it may just as well happen to a "good" person as to a "bad" person.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Existentialism, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/#AnxNotAbs 3.1 Anxiety, Nothingness, the Absurd]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the world's absurdity, at any point in time, anything can happen to anyone, and a tragic event could plummet someone into direct confrontation with the Absurd. The notion of the Absurd has been prominent in literature throughout history. Many of the literary works of [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Franz Kafka]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Eugène Ionesco]], [[Miguel de Unamuno]], [[Luigi Pirandello]],&lt;ref name=luigitheatre&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bassnett|first1=Susan|last2=Lorch|first2=Jennifer|title=Luigi Pirandello in the Theatre|date=March 18, 2014|publisher=Routledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FpwiAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=luigi+pirandello+existentialism#v=onepage&amp;q=existentialist|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=understandex&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=Mel|last2=Rodgers|first2=Nigel|title=Understanding Existentialism: Teach Yourself|date=2010|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vfczAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT105&amp;dq=pirandello+existentialism#v=onepage&amp;q=pirandello%20existentialism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=crisisconsciousness&gt;{{cite book|last1=Caputi|first1=Anthony Francis|title=Pirandello and the Crisis of Modern Consciousness|date=1988|publisher=University of Illinois Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Qv2nuJF7yYC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=pirandello+existential+absurd#v=onepage&amp;q=pirandello%20existentialist%20absurdity}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=masks&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mariani|first1=Umberto|title=Living Masks: The Achievement of Pirandello|date=2010|publisher=University of Toronto Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vBviYn43H34C&amp;pg=PT178&amp;dq=pirandello+existential+absurd#v=onepage&amp;q=pirandello%20existential%20absurd|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Joseph Heller]] and [[Albert Camus]] contain descriptions of people who encounter the absurdity of the world.

It is in relation to the concept of the devastating awareness of meaninglessness that Albert Camus claimed that "there is only one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide" in his ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]''. Although "prescriptions" against the possibly deleterious consequences of these kinds of encounters vary, from Kierkegaard's religious "stage" to Camus' insistence on persevering in spite of absurdity, the concern with helping people avoid living their lives in ways that put them in the perpetual danger of having everything meaningful break down is common to most existentialist philosophers. The possibility of having everything meaningful break down poses a threat of [[Quietism (philosophy)|quietism]], which is inherently against the existentialist philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jean-Paul Sartre |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/works/exist/sartre.htm |title=Existentialism is a Humanism, Jean-Paul Sartre 1946 |publisher=Marxists.org |accessdate=2010-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that the possibility of [[suicide]] makes all humans existentialists. The ultimate hero of absurdism lives without meaning and faces suicide without succumbing to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Suicide and Self-Deception|author=E Keen|publisher=Psychoanalytic Review|year=1973|url=http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=PSAR.060.0575A|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Facticity ===
{{main|Facticity}}

Facticity is a concept defined by Sartre in ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' as the ''[[being-in-itself|in-itself]]'', which delineates for humans the modalities of being and not being. This can be more easily understood when considering facticity in relation to the temporal dimension of our past: one's past is what one is, in the sense that it co-constitutes oneself. However, to say that one is only one's past would be to ignore a significant part of reality (the present and the future), while saying that one's past is only what one was, would entirely detach it from oneself now. A denial of one's own concrete past constitutes an inauthentic lifestyle, and the same goes for all other kinds of facticity (having a human body — e.g., one that doesn't allow a person to run faster than the speed of sound — identity, values, etc.).&lt;ref name="2.1 Facticity and Transcendence"&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Existentialism, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/#FacTra 2.1 Facticity and Transcendence]&lt;/ref&gt;

Facticity is both a limitation and a condition of freedom. It is a limitation in that a large part of one's facticity consists of things one couldn't have chosen (birthplace, etc.), but a condition of freedom in the sense that one's values most likely depend on it. However, even though one's facticity is "set in stone" (as being past, for instance), it cannot determine a person: The value ascribed to one's facticity is still ascribed to it freely by that person. As an example, consider two men, one of whom has no memory of his past and the other who remembers everything. They both have committed many crimes, but the first man, knowing nothing about this, leads a rather normal life while the second man, feeling trapped by his own past, continues a life of crime, blaming his own past for "trapping" him in this life. There is nothing essential about his committing crimes, but he ascribes this meaning to his past.

However, to disregard one's facticity when, in the continual process of self-making, one projects oneself into the future, that would be to put oneself in denial of oneself, and thus would be inauthentic. In other words, the origin of one's projection must still be one's facticity, though in the mode of not being it (essentially). An example of one focusing solely on one's possible projects without reflecting on one's current facticity:&lt;ref name="2.1 Facticity and Transcendence"/&gt; if one continually thinks about future possibilities related to being rich (e.g. a better car, bigger house, better quality of life, etc.) without considering the facticity of ''not currently having the financial means to do so''. In this example, considering both facticity and transcendence, an authentic mode of being would be considering future projects that might improve one's current finances (e.g. putting in extra hours, or investing savings) in order to arrive at a ''future-facticity'' of a modest pay rise, further leading to purchase of an affordable car.

Another aspect of facticity is that it entails [[angst]], both in the sense that freedom "produces" angst when limited by facticity, and in the sense that the lack of the possibility of having facticity to "step in" for one to take responsibility for something one has done, also produces angst.

Another aspect of existential freedom is that one can change one's values.  Thus, one is responsible for one's values, regardless of society's values.  The focus on [[freedom]] in existentialism is related to the limits of the responsibility one bears, as a result of one's freedom: the relationship between freedom and responsibility is one of interdependency, and a clarification of freedom also clarifies that for which one is responsible.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Existentialism, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/#FreVal 3. Freedom and Value]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Existentialism, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/#IdeVal 3.2 The Ideality of Values]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Authenticity ===
{{main|Authenticity (philosophy)|l1=Authenticity}}

Many noted existentialist writers consider the theme of authentic existence important. Authentic existence involves the idea that one has to "create oneself" and then live in accordance with this self. What is meant by [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] is that in acting, one should act as oneself, not as "one's acts" or as "one's genes" or any other essence requires. The authentic act is one that is in accordance with one's freedom. As a condition of freedom is facticity, this includes one's facticity, but not to the degree that this facticity can in any way determine one's transcendent choices (in the sense that one could then blame one's background [facticity] for making the choice one made [chosen project, from one's transcendence]). The role of facticity in relation to authenticity involves letting one's actual values come into play when one makes a choice (instead of, like Kierkegaard's Aesthete, "choosing" randomly), so that one also takes responsibility for the act instead of choosing either-or without allowing the options to have different values.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Existentialism, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/#Aut 2.3 Authenticity]&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to this, the inauthentic is the denial to live in accordance with one's freedom. This can take many forms, from pretending choices are meaningless or random, through convincing oneself that some form of [[determinism]] is true, to a sort of "mimicry" where one acts as "one should".

How "one should" act is often determined by an image one has, of how one such as oneself (say, a bank manager, lion tamer, prostitute, etc.) acts. In [[Being and Nothingness]], Sartre relates an example of a "[[waiter]]" in ''bad faith'': he merely takes part in the "act" of being a typical waiter, albeit very convincingly.&lt;ref name="Jean-Paul Sartre 2003"&gt;Jean-Paul Sartre, ''Being and Nothingness'', Routledge Classics (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; This image usually corresponds to some sort of social norm, but this does not mean that all acting in accordance with social norms is inauthentic: The main point is the attitude one takes to one's own freedom and responsibility, and the extent to which one acts in accordance with this freedom.

=== The Other and the Look ===
{{main|Other (philosophy)}}

The Other (when written with a capital "O") is a concept more properly belonging to [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and its account of [[intersubjectivity]]. However, the concept has seen widespread use in existentialist writings, and the conclusions drawn from it differ slightly from the phenomenological accounts. The experience of the Other is the experience of another free subject who inhabits the same world as a person does. In its most basic form, it is this experience of the Other that constitutes intersubjectivity and objectivity. To clarify, when one experiences someone else, and this Other person experiences the world (the same world that a person experiences)—only from "over there"—the world itself is constituted as objective in that it is something that is "there" as identical for both of the subjects; a person experiences the other person as experiencing the same things. This experience of the Other's look is what is termed the Look (sometimes [[the Gaze]]).&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Existentialism, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/#Ali 2.2 Alienation]&lt;/ref&gt;

While this experience, in its basic phenomenological sense, constitutes the world as objective, and oneself as objectively existing subjectivity (one experiences oneself as seen in the Other's Look in precisely the same way that one experiences the Other as seen by him, as subjectivity), in existentialism, it also acts as a kind of limitation of freedom. This is because the Look tends to objectify what it sees. As such, when one experiences oneself in the Look, one doesn't experience oneself as nothing (no thing), but as something. Sartre's own example of a man peeping at someone through a keyhole can help clarify this: at first, this man is entirely caught up in the situation he is in; he is in a pre-reflexive state where his entire consciousness is directed at what goes on in the room. Suddenly, he hears a creaking floorboard behind him, and he becomes aware of himself as seen by the Other. He is thus filled with shame for he perceives himself as he would perceive someone else doing what he was doing, as a [[Peeping Tom]]. The Look is then co-constitutive of one's facticity.

Another characteristic feature of the Look is that no Other really needs to have been there: It is quite possible that the creaking floorboard was nothing but the movement of an old house; the Look isn't some kind of mystical telepathic experience of the actual way the other sees one (there may also have been someone there, but he could have not noticed that the person was there). It is only one's perception of the way another might perceive him.

=== Angst and dread ===
{{main|Angst}}
{{See also|Living educational theory}}

"Existential [[angst]]", sometimes called existential dread, anxiety, or [[anguish]], is a term that is common to many existentialist thinkers. It is generally held to be a negative feeling arising from the experience of human freedom and responsibility. The archetypical example is the experience one has when standing on a cliff where one not only fears falling off it, but also dreads the possibility of throwing oneself off. In this experience that "nothing is holding me back", one senses the lack of anything that predetermines one to either throw oneself off or to stand still, and one experiences one's own freedom. Angst, according to the modern existentialist, [[Adam Fong]], is the sudden realization of a lack of meaning, often while one completes a task that initially seems to have intrinsic meaning.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt;

It can also be seen in relation to the previous point how angst is before nothing, and this is what sets it apart from fear that has an object. While in the case of fear, one can take definitive measures to remove the object of fear, in the case of angst, no such "constructive" measures are possible. The use of the word "nothing" in this context relates both to the inherent insecurity about the consequences of one's actions, and to the fact that, in experiencing freedom as angst, one also realizes that one is fully responsible for these consequences. There is nothing in people (genetically, for instance) that acts in their stead—that they can blame if something goes wrong. Therefore, not every choice is perceived as having dreadful possible consequences (and, it can be claimed, human lives would be unbearable if every choice facilitated dread). However, this doesn't change the fact that freedom remains a condition of every action.

=== Despair ===
{{Main|Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard#Despair|l1=Despair}}
{{See also|Existential crisis}}

Despair, in existentialism, is generally defined as a loss of hope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tfd.com/despair |title=despair - definition of despair by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Tfd.com |accessdate=2010-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, it is a loss of hope in reaction to a breakdown in one or more of the defining qualities of one's self or identity. If a person is invested in being a particular thing, such as a bus driver or an upstanding citizen, and then finds their being-thing compromised, they would normally be found in a state of despair—a hopeless state. For example, a singer who loses the ability to sing may despair if they have nothing else to fall back on—nothing to rely on for their identity. They find themselves unable to be what defined their being.

What sets the existentialist notion of despair apart from the conventional definition is that existentialist despair is a state one is in even when they aren't overtly in despair. So long as a person's identity depends on qualities that can crumble, they are in perpetual despair—and as there is, in Sartrean terms, no human essence found in conventional reality on which to constitute the individual's sense of identity, despair is a universal human condition. As Kierkegaard defines it in ''[[Either/Or]]'': "Let each one learn what he can; both of us can learn that a person’s unhappiness never lies in his lack of control over external conditions, since this would only make him completely unhappy."&lt;ref&gt;Either/Or Part II p. 188 Hong&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Works of Love]]'', he said: {{Quotation|When the God-forsaken worldliness of earthly life shuts itself in complacency, the confined air develops poison, the moment gets stuck and stands still, the prospect is lost, a need is felt for a refreshing, enlivening breeze to cleanse the air and dispel the poisonous vapors lest we suffocate in worldliness. ... Lovingly to hope all things is the opposite of despairingly to hope [[nothing]] at all. Love hopes all things—yet is never put to shame. To relate oneself expectantly to the possibility of the good is to hope. To relate oneself expectantly to the possibility of evil is to fear. By the decision to choose hope one decides infinitely more than it seems, because it is an eternal decision. pp. 246–50}}

==Opposition to positivism and rationalism==
{{See also|Positivism|Rationalism}}

Existentialists oppose definitions of human beings as primarily rational, and, therefore, oppose [[positivism]] and [[rationalism]]. Existentialism asserts that people actually make decisions based on subjective meaning rather than pure rationality. The rejection of reason as the source of meaning is a common theme of existentialist thought, as is the focus on the feelings of [[anxiety]] and [[angst|dread]] that we feel in the face of our own radical [[free will|freedom]] and our awareness of death. Kierkegaard advocated rationality as a means to interact with the objective world (e.g., in the natural sciences), but when it comes to existential problems, reason is insufficient: "Human reason has boundaries".&lt;ref&gt;''Søren Kierkegaard's Journals and Papers'' Vol 5, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Kierkegaard, Sartre saw problems with rationality, calling it a form of "bad faith", an attempt by the self to impose structure on a world of phenomena—"the Other"—that is fundamentally irrational and random. According to Sartre, rationality and other forms of bad faith hinder people from finding meaning in freedom. To try to suppress their feelings of anxiety and dread, people confine themselves within everyday experience, Sartre asserts, thereby relinquishing their freedom and acquiescing to being possessed in one form or another by "the Look" of "the Other" (i.e., possessed by another person—or at least one's idea of that other person).

== Religion ==
{{See also|Atheistic existentialism|Christian existentialism|Jewish existentialism}}

An existentialist reading of the [[Bible]] would demand that the reader recognize that (s)he is an existing [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] studying the words more as a recollection of events. This is in contrast to looking at a collection of "truths" that are outside and unrelated to the reader, but may develop a sense of reality/God. Such a reader is not obligated to follow the commandments as if an external agent is forcing these commandments upon them, but as though they are inside them and guiding them from inside. This is the task Kierkegaard takes up when he asks: "Who has the more difficult task: the teacher who lectures on earnest things a meteor's distance from everyday life - or the learner who should put it to use?"&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Soren. ''Works of Love''. Harper &amp; Row, Publishers. New York, N.Y. 1962. p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

== Confusion with nihilism ==
{{See also|Existential nihilism}}

Although [[nihilism]] and existentialism are distinct philosophies, they are often confused with one another as both are rooted in the human experience of anguish and confusion stemming from the apparent meaninglessness of a world in which humans are compelled to find or create meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/nihilism/#H3 |title=Nihilism |author=Alan Pratt |date=April 23, 2001 |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=[[Embry-Riddle University]] |accessdate=November 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A primary cause of confusion is that [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] is an important philosopher in both fields. Existentialist philosophers often stress the importance of [[Angst]] as signifying the absolute lack of any objective ground for action, a move that is often reduced to a [[Moral nihilism|moral]] or an [[existential nihilism]]. A pervasive theme in the works of existentialist philosophy, however, is to persist through encounters with the absurd, as seen in [[Albert Camus|Camus]]' ''The Myth of Sisyphus'' ("One must imagine Sisyphus happy"),&lt;ref&gt;Camus, Albert. "The Myth of Sisyphus". [http://www.nyu.edu/classes/keefer/hell/camus.html NYU.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; and it is only very rarely that existentialist philosophers dismiss morality or one's self-created meaning: Kierkegaard regained a sort of morality in the religious (although he wouldn't himself agree that it was ethical; the religious suspends the ethical), and [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]]'s final words in ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' are "All these questions, which refer us to a pure and not an accessory (or impure) reflection, can find their reply only on the ethical plane. We shall devote to them a future work."&lt;ref name="Jean-Paul Sartre 2003"/&gt;

== History ==

=== 19th century ===

==== Kierkegaard and Nietzsche ====
{{Main|Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche}}

[[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] were two of the first philosophers considered fundamental to the existentialist movement, though neither used the term "existentialism" and it is unclear whether they would have supported the existentialism of the 20th century. They focused on subjective human experience rather than the objective truths of mathematics and science, which they believed were too detached or observational to truly get at the human experience. Like [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], they were interested in people's quiet struggle with the apparent meaninglessness of life and the use of diversion to escape from [[boredom]]. Unlike Pascal, Kierkegaard and Nietzsche also considered the role of making free choices, particularly regarding fundamental values and beliefs, and how such choices change the nature and identity of the chooser.&lt;ref&gt;Luper, Steven. "Existing". Mayfield Publishing, 2000, pp. 4–5 and 11&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard's [[knight of faith]] and Nietzsche's [[Übermensch]] are representative of people who exhibit [[Free will|Freedom]], in that they define the nature of their own existence. Nietzsche's idealized individual invents his own values and creates the very terms they excel under. By contrast, Kierkegaard, opposed to the level of abstraction in Hegel, and not nearly as hostile (actually welcoming) to [[Christianity]] as Nietzsche, argues through a pseudonym that the objective certainty of religious truths (specifically Christian) is not only impossible, but even founded on logical paradoxes. Yet he continues to imply that a [[leap of faith]] is a possible means for an individual to reach a higher stage of existence that transcends and contains both an aesthetic and ethical value of life. Kierkegaard and Nietzsche were also precursors to other intellectual movements, including [[postmodernism]], and various strands of [[psychology|psychotherapy.]] However, Kierkegaard believed that individuals should live in accordance with their thinking.

====Dostoyevsky====

The first important literary author also important to existentialism was the Russian [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Hubben, William. ''Dostoyevsky, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche and Kafka, Jabber-wacky'', Scribner, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Dostoyevsky's ''[[Notes from Underground]]'' portrays a man unable to fit into society and unhappy with the identities he creates for himself. [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], in his book on existentialism ''[[Existentialism is a Humanism]]'', quoted Dostoyevsky's ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' as an example of [[existential crisis]]. Sartre attributes Ivan Karamazov's claim, "If God did not exist, everything would be permitted"&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, Jean-Paul. ''Existentialism is a Humanism'' http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/works/exist/sartre.htm ; Retrieved 2012-04-01.&lt;/ref&gt; to Dostoyevsky himself, though this quote does not appear in the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egs.edu/faculty/slavoj-zizek/articles/if-there-is-a-god-then-anything-is-permitted/|author=Zizek, Slavoj|title=If there is a God, then everything is permitted|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417192350/http://www.egs.edu/faculty/slavoj-zizek/articles/if-there-is-a-god-then-anything-is-permitted/|archivedate=2015-04-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a similar sentiment is explicitly stated when Alyosha visits Dimitri in prison. Dimitri mentions his conversations with Rakitin in which the idea that "Then, if He doesn't exist, man is king of the earth, of the universe" allowing the inference contained in Sartre's attribution to remain a valid idea contested within the novel.&lt;ref&gt;Dostoyevsky Fyodor. "[[The Brothers Karamazov]]".&lt;/ref&gt; Other Dostoyevsky novels covered issues raised in existentialist philosophy while presenting story lines divergent from secular existentialism: for example, in ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'', the protagonist Raskolnikov experiences an existential crisis and then moves toward a Christian Orthodox worldview similar to that advocated by Dostoyevsky himself.&lt;ref name="Rukhsana"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/911266433|title=Existentialism and its relevance to the contemporary system of education in India : existentialism and present educational scenario|last=Rukhsana.|first=Akhter,|isbn=3954892774|location=Hamburg|oclc=911266433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early 20th century ===
{{See also|Martin Heidegger}}

In the first decades of the 20th century, a number of philosophers and writers explored existentialist ideas. The Spanish philosopher [[Miguel de Unamuno y Jugo]], in his 1913 book ''The Tragic Sense of Life in Men and Nations'', emphasized the life of "flesh and bone" as opposed to that of abstract rationalism. Unamuno rejected systematic philosophy in favor of the individual's quest for faith. He retained a sense of the tragic, even absurd nature of the quest, symbolized by his enduring interest in [[Cervantes]]' fictional character [[Don Quixote]]. A novelist, poet and dramatist as well as philosophy professor at the University of Salamanca, Unamuno wrote a short story about a priest's crisis of faith, ''[[San Manuel Bueno, Mártir|Saint Manuel the Good, Martyr]]'', which has been collected in anthologies of existentialist fiction. Another Spanish thinker, [[Ortega y Gasset]], writing in 1914, held that human existence must always be defined as the individual person combined with the concrete circumstances of his life: "''Yo soy yo y mi circunstancia''" ("I am myself and my circumstances"). Sartre likewise believed that human existence is not an abstract matter, but is always situated ("''en situation''").

Although [[Martin Buber]] wrote his major philosophical works in German, and studied and taught at the Universities of Berlin and [[Frankfurt]], he stands apart from the mainstream of German philosophy. Born into a Jewish family in Vienna in 1878, he was also a scholar of Jewish culture and involved at various times in [[Zionism]] and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidism]]. In 1938, he moved permanently to [[Jerusalem]]. His best-known philosophical work was the short book ''[[I and Thou]]'', published in 1922. For Buber, the fundamental fact of human existence, too readily overlooked by scientific rationalism and abstract philosophical thought, is "man with man", a dialogue that takes place in the so-called "sphere of between" (''"das Zwischenmenschliche"'').&lt;ref&gt;Maurice S. Friedman, ''Martin Buber. The Life of Dialogue'' (University of Chicago press, 1955, p. 85)&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Russian thinkers, [[Lev Shestov]] and [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], became well known as existentialist thinkers during their post-Revolutionary exiles in Paris. Shestov, born into a Ukrainian-Jewish family in Kiev, had launched an attack on rationalism and systematization in philosophy as early as 1905 in his book of aphorisms ''All Things Are Possible''.

Berdyaev, also from Kiev but with a background in the Eastern Orthodox Church, drew a radical distinction between the world of spirit and the everyday world of objects. Human freedom, for Berdyaev, is rooted in the realm of spirit, a realm independent of scientific notions of causation. To the extent the individual human being lives in the objective world, he is estranged from authentic spiritual freedom. "Man" is not to be interpreted naturalistically, but as a being created in God's image, an originator of free, creative acts.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Breisach, ''Introduction to Modern Existentialism'', New York (1962), pp. 173–76&lt;/ref&gt; He published a major work on these themes, ''The Destiny of Man'', in 1931.

[[Gabriel Marcel]], long before coining the term "existentialism", introduced important existentialist themes to a French audience in his early essay "Existence and Objectivity" (1925) and in his ''Metaphysical Journal'' (1927).&lt;ref name="Samuel M. Keen 1967"&gt;Samuel M. Keen, "Gabriel Marcel" in Paul Edwards (ed.) ''The Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'' (Macmillan Publishing Co, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; A dramatist as well as a philosopher, Marcel found his philosophical starting point in a condition of metaphysical alienation: the human individual searching for harmony in a transient life. Harmony, for Marcel, was to be sought through "secondary reflection", a "dialogical" rather than "dialectical" approach to the world, characterized by "wonder and astonishment" and open to the "presence" of other people and of God rather than merely to "information" about them. For Marcel, such presence implied more than simply being there (as one thing might be in the presence of another thing); it connoted "extravagant" availability, and the willingness to put oneself at the disposal of the other.&lt;ref&gt;John Macquarrie, ''Existentialism'' (Pelican, 1973, p. 110)&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcel contrasted ''secondary reflection'' with abstract, scientific-technical ''primary reflection'', which he associated with the activity of the abstract [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] ego. For Marcel, philosophy was a concrete activity undertaken by a sensing, feeling human being incarnate—embodied—in a concrete world.&lt;ref name="Samuel M. Keen 1967"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Macquarrie, ''Existentialism'' (Pelican, 1973, p. 96)&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] adopted the term "existentialism" for his own philosophy in the 1940s, Marcel's thought has been described as "almost diametrically opposed" to that of Sartre.&lt;ref name="Samuel M. Keen 1967"/&gt; Unlike Sartre, Marcel was a Christian, and became a Catholic convert in 1929.

In Germany, the psychologist and philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]]—who later described existentialism as a "phantom" created by the public&lt;ref&gt;Karl Jaspers, "Philosophical Autobiography" in Paul Arthur Schilpp (ed.) ''The Philosophy of Karl Jaspers (The Library of Living Philosophers IX (Tudor Publishing Company, 1957, p. 75/11)&lt;/ref&gt;—called his own thought, heavily influenced by Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, ''Existenzphilosophie''. For Jaspers, "''Existenz''-philosophy is the way of thought by means of which man seeks to become himself...This way of thought does not cognize objects, but elucidates and makes actual the being of the thinker".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Jaspers, "Philosophical Autobiography" in Paul Arthur Schilpp (ed.) ''The Philosophy of Karl Jaspers (The Library of Living Philosophers IX (Tudor Publishing Company, 1957, p. 40)&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaspers, a professor at the University of [[Heidelberg]], was acquainted with [[Martin Heidegger]], who held a professorship at [[Marburg]] before acceding to Husserl's chair at [[Freiburg]] in 1928. They held many philosophical discussions, but later became estranged over Heidegger's support of [[Nazism|National Socialism]] (Nazism). They shared an admiration for Kierkegaard,&lt;ref&gt;Karl Jaspers, "Philosophical Autobiography" in Paul Arthur Schilpp (ed.) ''The Philosophy of Karl Jaspers (The Library of Living Philosophers IX (Tudor Publishing Company, 1957, p. 75/2 and following)&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 1930s, Heidegger lectured extensively on Nietzsche. Nevertheless, the extent to which Heidegger should be considered an existentialist is debatable. In ''[[Being and Time]]'' he presented a method of rooting philosophical explanations in human existence (''Dasein'') to be analysed in terms of existential categories (''existentiale''); and this has led many commentators to treat him as an important figure in the existentialist movement.

=== After the Second World War ===

Following the [[Second World War]], existentialism became a well-known and significant philosophical and cultural movement, mainly through the public prominence of two French writers, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Albert Camus]], who wrote best-selling novels, plays and widely read journalism as well as theoretical texts.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Baert, ''The Existentialist Moment; The Rise of Sartre as a Public Intellectual'' (Polity Press, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; These years also saw the growing reputation of Heidegger's book ''[[Being and Time]]'' outside Germany.
[[File:Sartre and de Beauvoir at Balzac Memorial.jpg|thumb|left|upright|French philosophers [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Simone de Beauvoir]]]]

Sartre dealt with existentialist themes in his 1938 novel ''[[Nausea (novel)|Nausea]]'' and the short stories in his 1939 collection ''[[The Wall (book)|The Wall]]'', and had published his treatise on existentialism, ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', in 1943, but it was in the two years following the liberation of Paris from the German occupying forces that he and his close associates—Camus, Simone de Beauvoir, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and others—became internationally famous as the leading figures of a movement known as existentialism.&lt;ref name="Ronald Aronson 2004"&gt;Ronald Aronson, ''Camus and Sartre'' (University of Chicago Press, 2004, chapter 3 ''passim'')&lt;/ref&gt; In a very short period of time, Camus and Sartre in particular became the leading public intellectuals of post-war France, achieving by the end of 1945 "a fame that reached across all audiences."&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Aronson, ''Camus and Sartre'' (University of Chicago Press, 2004, p. 44)&lt;/ref&gt; Camus was an editor of the most popular leftist (former [[French Resistance]]) newspaper ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]''; Sartre launched his journal of leftist thought, ''[[Les Temps Modernes]]'', and two weeks later gave the widely reported lecture on existentialism and [[secular humanism]] to a packed meeting of the Club Maintenant. Beauvoir wrote that "not a week passed without the newspapers discussing us";&lt;ref&gt;Simone de Beauvoir, ''Force of Circumstance'', quoted in Ronald Aronson, ''Camus and Sartre'' (University of Chicago Press, 2004, p. 48)&lt;/ref&gt; existentialism became "the first media craze of the postwar era."&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Aronson, ''Camus and Sartre'' (University of Chicago Press, 2004, p. 48)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1947, Camus' earlier fiction and plays had been reprinted, his new play ''[[Caligula (play)|Caligula]]'' had been performed and his novel ''[[The Plague]]'' published; the first two novels of Sartre's ''[[The Roads to Freedom]]'' trilogy had appeared, as had Beauvoir's novel ''[[The Blood of Others]]''. Works by Camus and Sartre were already appearing in foreign editions. The Paris-based existentialists had become famous.&lt;ref name="Ronald Aronson 2004"/&gt;

Sartre had traveled to Germany in 1930 to study the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Martin Heidegger]],&lt;ref&gt;Rüdiger Safranski, ''Martin Heidgger – Between Good and Evil'' (Harvard University Press, 1998, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; and he included critical comments on their work in his major treatise ''[[Being and Nothingness]]''. Heidegger's thought had also become known in French philosophical circles through its use by [[Alexandre Kojève]] in explicating Hegel in a series of lectures given in Paris in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Entry on Kojève in Martin Cohen (editor), ''The Essentials of Philosophy and Ethics''(Hodder Arnold, 2006, p. 158); see also Alexandre Kojève, ''Introduction to the Reading of Hegel: Lectures on the Phenomenology of Spirit'' (Cornell University Press, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt; The lectures were highly influential; members of the audience included not only Sartre and Merleau-Ponty, but [[Raymond Queneau]], [[Georges Bataille]], [[Louis Althusser]], [[André Breton]], and [[Jacques Lacan]].&lt;ref&gt;Entry on Kojève in Martin Cohen (editor), ''The Essentials of Philosophy and Ethics''(Hodder Arnold, 2006, p. 158)&lt;/ref&gt; A selection from Heidegger's ''[[Being and Time]]'' was published in French in 1938, and his essays began to appear in French philosophy journals.
[[File:Albert Camus, gagnant de prix Nobel, portrait en buste, posé au bureau, faisant face à gauche, cigarette de tabagisme.jpg|thumb|upright|French-Algerian philosopher, novelist, and playwright [[Albert Camus]]]]

Heidegger read Sartre's work and was initially impressed, commenting: "Here for the first time I encountered an independent thinker who, from the foundations up, has experienced the area out of which I think. Your work shows such an immediate comprehension of my philosophy as I have never before encountered."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Hediegger, letter, quoted in Rüdiger Safranski, ''Martin Heidgger – Between Good and Evil'' (Harvard University Press, 1998, p. 349)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, however, in response to a question posed by his French follower [[Jean Beaufret]],&lt;ref&gt;Rüdiger Safranski, ''Martin Heidegger – Between Good and Evil'' (Harvard University Press, 1998, p. 356)&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger distanced himself from Sartre's position and existentialism in general in his ''[[Letter on Humanism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Richardson, ''Martin Heidegger: From Phenomenology to Thought'' (Martjinus Nijhoff,1967, p. 351)&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger's reputation continued to grow in France during the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1960s, Sartre attempted to reconcile existentialism and [[Marxism]] in his work ''[[Critique of Dialectical Reason]]''. A major theme throughout his writings was freedom and responsibility.

Camus was a friend of Sartre, until their falling-out, and wrote several works with existential themes including ''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]'', ''Summer in Algiers'', ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'', and ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'', the latter being "considered—to what would have been Camus's irritation—the exemplary existentialist novel."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Messud |first = Claire |authorlink = Claire Messud |year = 2014 |title = A New 'L'Étranger' |url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/jun/05/camus-new-letranger/ |journal = [[The New York Review of Books]] |volume = 61 |number = 10 |accessdate = 1 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Camus, like many others, rejected the existentialist label, and considered his works concerned with facing the absurd. In the titular book, Camus uses the analogy of the Greek myth of [[Sisyphus]] to demonstrate the futility of existence. In the myth, Sisyphus is condemned for eternity to roll a rock up a hill, but when he reaches the summit, the rock will roll to the bottom again. Camus believes that this existence is pointless but that Sisyphus ultimately finds meaning and purpose in his task, simply by continually applying himself to it. The first half of the book contains an extended rebuttal of what Camus took to be existentialist philosophy in the works of Kierkegaard, Shestov, Heidegger, and Jaspers.

[[Simone de Beauvoir]], an important existentialist who spent much of her life as Sartre's partner, wrote about feminist and existentialist ethics in her works, including ''[[The Second Sex]]'' and ''[[The Ethics of Ambiguity]]''. Although often overlooked due to her relationship with Sartre,&lt;ref name = Bergoffen-SEoP&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/beauvoir/|title=Simone de Beauvoir|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |author=Bergoffen, Debra|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; de Beauvoir integrated existentialism with other forms of thinking such as feminism, unheard of at the time, resulting in alienation from fellow writers such as Camus.&lt;ref name="Rukhsana"/&gt;

[[Paul Tillich]], an important existentialist theologian following Kierkegaard and [[Karl Barth]], applied existentialist concepts to [[Christian theology]], and helped introduce [[neo-orthodoxy|existential theology]] to the general public. His seminal work ''The Courage to Be'' follows Kierkegaard's analysis of anxiety and life's absurdity, but puts forward the thesis that modern humans must, via God, achieve selfhood in spite of life's absurdity. [[Rudolf Bultmann]] used Kierkegaard's and Heidegger's philosophy of existence to demythologize Christianity by interpreting Christian mythical concepts into existentialist concepts.

[[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], an [[Existential phenomenology|existential phenomenologist]], was for a time a companion of Sartre. Merleau-Ponty's ''[[Phenomenology of Perception]]'' (1945) was recognized as a major statement of French existentialism.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, G. B., in Robert Audi's ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999) [p. 559]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that Merleau-Ponty's work ''Humanism and Terror'' greatly influenced Sartre. However, in later years they were to disagree irreparably, dividing many existentialists such as de Beauvoir,&lt;ref name="Rukhsana"/&gt; who sided with Sartre.

[[Colin Wilson]], an English writer, published his study ''[[The Outsider (Colin Wilson)|The Outsider]]'' in 1956, initially to critical acclaim. In this book and others (e.g. ''Introduction to the New Existentialism''), he attempted to reinvigorate what he perceived as a pessimistic philosophy and bring it to a wider audience. He was not, however, academically trained, and his work was attacked by professional philosophers for lack of rigor and critical standards.&lt;ref&gt;K. Gunnar Bergström, ''An Odyssey to Freedom'' University of Uppsala, 1983, p. 92. Colin Stanley, ''Colin Wilson, a Celebration: Essays and Recollections'' Cecil Woolf, 1988, p. 43)&lt;/ref&gt;

This, in turn, leads him to a better understanding of humanity. The French film, ''[[Mood Indigo (film)|Mood Indigo]]'' (directed by [[Michel Gondry]]) embraced various elements of existentialism.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The film ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]'', released in 1994, depicts life in a prison in [[Maine]], United States to explore several existentialist concepts.&lt;ref&gt;For an examination of the existentialist elements within the film, see [[Philosophy Now]], issue 102, accessible [http://philosophynow.org/issues/102/The_Shawshank_Redemption here (link)], accessed 3 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Literature ====
Existential perspectives are also found in modern literature to varying degrees, especially since the 1920s. [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]]'s ''[[Journey to the End of the Night]]'' (Voyage au bout de la nuit, 1932) celebrated by both Sartre and Beauvoir, contained many of the themes that would be found in later existential literature, and is in some ways, the proto-existential novel. Jean-Paul Sartre's 1938 novel ''[[Nausea (novel)|Nausea]]''&lt;ref name=SartreNausea&gt;{{Cite journal| first= Jean-Paul| last= Sartre| translator-last=Baldick |translator-first=Robert |translator-link=Robert Baldick | title= Nausea| place= London| publisher= Penguin| year= 2000 |orig-year=1938 | page= | isbn=| postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; was "steeped in Existential ideas", and is considered an accessible way of grasping his philosophical stance.&lt;ref name=Earnshaw2006&gt;{{Cite book| first= Steven| last= Earnshaw| author-link=| title = Existentialism: A Guide for the Perplexed| place= London| publisher= Continuum| year= 2006| page= 75| isbn= 0-8264-8530-8| postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1900 and 1960, other authors such as [[Albert Camus]], [[Franz Kafka]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[T.S.

The philosophy's influence even reached pulp literature shortly after the turn of the 20th century, as seen in the existential disparity witnessed in Man's lack of control of his fate in the works of [[H.P. Lovecraft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.horrorreview.com/essay/eglovecraft12008.html |title=Zarathustra . . . Cthulhu . Meursault:  Existential Futility in H.P.

Books such as ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' (1968) (now republished as ''[[Blade Runner]]'') by [[Philip K. Dick]], ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'' by [[Kurt Vonnegut]],  ''[[Fight Club (novel)|Fight Club]]'' by [[Chuck Palahniuk]] and ''[https://www.writersworkshopindia.com/books/fiction/novel/formless-meanderings/ Formless Meanderings]'' by [[Bharath Srinivasan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Bharath|last=Srinivasan|title= Formless Meanderings|place= Kolkata|publisher= Writers Workshop|url=https://www.writersworkshopindia.com/books/fiction/novel/formless-meanderings/| year= 2009 |pages= 352| isbn=81-8157-945-4|ignore-isbn-error=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; all distort the line between reality and appearance while simultaneously espousing existential themes.

==== Theatre ====
[[Jean-Paul Sartre]] wrote ''[[No Exit]]'' in 1944, an existentialist [[play (theatre)|play]] originally published in French as ''Huis Clos'' (meaning ''[[wikt:in camera|In Camera]]'' or "behind closed doors"), which is the source of the popular quote, "Hell is other people." (In French, "L'enfer, c'est les autres"). The play begins with a Valet leading a man into a room that the audience soon realizes is in hell. Eventually he is joined by two women. After their entry, the Valet leaves and the door is shut and locked. All three expect to be tortured, but no torturer arrives. Instead, they realize they are there to torture each other, which they do effectively by probing each other's sins, desires, and unpleasant memories.

Existentialist themes are displayed in the [[Theatre of the Absurd]], notably in [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', in which two men divert themselves while they wait expectantly for someone (or something) named Godot who never arrives. They claim Godot is an acquaintance, but in fact, hardly know him, admitting they would not recognize him if they saw him. Samuel Beckett, once asked who or what Godot is, replied, "If I knew, I would have said so in the play." To occupy themselves, the men eat, sleep, talk, argue, sing, play games, [[Physical exercise|exercise]], swap hats, and contemplate [[suicide]]—anything "to hold the terrible silence at bay".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 31 December 1964. Quoted in Knowlson, J., ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996), p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; The play "exploits several archetypal forms and situations, all of which lend themselves to both comedy and [[pathos]]."&lt;ref&gt;Cronin, A., ''Samuel Beckett The Last Modernist'' (London: Flamingo, 1997), p. 391&lt;/ref&gt; The play also illustrates an attitude toward human experience on earth: the poignancy, oppression, camaraderie, hope, corruption, and bewilderment of human experience that can be reconciled only in the mind and art of the absurdist. The play examines questions such as death, the [[Meaning of life (philosophy)#Existentialism|meaning of human existence]] and the place of God in human existence.

[[Tom Stoppard]]'s ''[[Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' is an [[Theatre of the Absurd|absurdist]] [[tragicomedy]] first staged at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] in 1966.&lt;ref name="Chrono"&gt;{{cite web | author= Michael H. Hutchins | title=A Tom Stoppard Bibliography: Chronology | work=The Stephen Sondheim Reference Guide | url=http://www.sondheimguide.com/Stoppard/chronology.html | date=14 August 2006 | accessdate=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play expands upon the exploits of two minor characters from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[Hamlet]]''. Comparisons have also been drawn to [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''[[Waiting For Godot]]'', for the presence of two central characters who appear almost as two halves of a single character. Many plot features are similar as well: the characters pass time by playing [[Questions (game)|Questions]], impersonating other characters, and interrupting each other or remaining silent for long periods of time. The two characters are portrayed as two clowns or fools in a world beyond their understanding. They stumble through philosophical arguments while not realizing the implications, and muse on the irrationality and randomness of the world.

[[Jean Anouilh]]'s ''[[Antigone (Anouilh play)|Antigone]]'' also presents arguments founded on existentialist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wren|first=Celia |date= 12 December 2007 |title= From Forum, an Earnest and Painstaking 'Antigone' |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/11/AR2007121102254.html |publisher=Washington Post |accessdate=2008-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a tragedy inspired by Greek mythology and the play of the same name (Antigone, by Sophocles) from the 5th century BC. In English, it is often distinguished from its antecedent by being pronounced in its original French form, approximately "Ante-GŌN." The play was first performed in Paris on 6 February 1944, during the Nazi occupation of France. Produced under Nazi censorship, the play is purposefully ambiguous with regards to the rejection of authority (represented by Antigone) and the acceptance of it (represented by Creon). The parallels to the French Resistance and the Nazi occupation have been drawn. Antigone rejects life as desperately meaningless but without affirmatively choosing a noble death. The crux of the play is the lengthy dialogue concerning the nature of power, fate, and choice, during which Antigone says that she is, "...&amp;nbsp;disgusted with [the]...promise of a humdrum happiness." She states that she would rather die than live a mediocre existence.

Critic [[Martin Esslin]] in his book ''Theatre of the Absurd'' pointed out how many contemporary playwrights such as [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Eugène Ionesco]], [[Jean Genet]], and [[Arthur Adamov]] wove into their plays the existentialist belief that we are absurd beings loose in a universe empty of real meaning. Esslin noted that many of these playwrights demonstrated the philosophy better than did the plays by Sartre and Camus. Though most of such playwrights, subsequently labeled "Absurdist" (based on Esslin's book), denied affiliations with existentialism and were often staunchly anti-philosophical (for example Ionesco often claimed he identified more with [['Pataphysics]] or with [[Surrealism]] than with existentialism), the playwrights are often linked to existentialism based on Esslin's observation.&lt;ref&gt;Kernan, Alvin B. ''The Modern American Theater: A Collection of Critical Essays''. Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: [[Prentice-Hall]], 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychoanalysis and psychotherapy ===
{{Main|Existential therapy}}

A major offshoot of existentialism as a philosophy is existentialist psychology and psychoanalysis, which first crystallized in the work of [[Otto Rank]], Freud's closest associate for 20 years. Without awareness of the writings of Rank, [[Ludwig Binswanger]] was influenced by [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]]. A later figure was [[Viktor Frankl]], who briefly met [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] as a young man.&lt;ref&gt;[Frankl, Viktor: Recollections: An Autobiography. Perseus Publishing, Massachusetts 2000, p. 51]&lt;/ref&gt; His [[logotherapy]] can be regarded as a form of existentialist therapy. The existentialists would also influence [[social psychology]], antipositivist micro-[[sociology]], [[symbolic interactionism]], and [[post-structuralism]], with the work of thinkers such as [[Georg Simmel]]&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Jon. ''Kierkegaard and Existentialism''. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michel Foucault]]. Foucault was a great reader of Kierkegaard even though he almost never refers this author, who nonetheless had for him an importance as secret as it was decisive.&lt;ref&gt;Flynn, Thomas R. ''Sartre, Foucault, and Historical Reason'', p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early contributor to existentialist psychology in the United States was [[Rollo May]], who was strongly influenced by [[Kierkegaard]] and [[Otto Rank]]. One of the most prolific writers on techniques and theory of existentialist psychology in the USA is [[Irvin D. Yalom]]. Yalom states that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Aside from their reaction against Freud's mechanistic, deterministic model of the mind and their assumption of a phenomenological approach in therapy, the existentialist analysts have little in common and have never been regarded as a cohesive ideological school. These thinkers—who include Ludwig Binswanger, [[Medard Boss]], [[Eugène Minkowski]], V.E. Gebsattel, Roland Kuhn, G. Caruso, F.T. Buytendijk, G. Bally and Victor Frankl—were almost entirely unknown to the American psychotherapeutic community until Rollo May's highly influential 1985 book ''Existence''—and especially his introductory essay—introduced their work into this country.&lt;ref name=Yalom1980&gt;{{Cite book| first= Irvin D.| last= Yalom| author-link= Irvin D. Yalom| title = Existential Psychotherapy| place= New York| publisher= BasicBooks (Subsidiary of Perseus Books, L.L.C.| year= 1980| page= 17| isbn= 0-465-02147-6| postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;}} Note: The copyright year has not changed, but the book remains in print.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A more recent contributor to the development of a European version of existentialist psychotherapy is the British-based [[Emmy van Deurzen]].

Anxiety's importance in existentialism makes it a popular topic in [[psychotherapy]]. Therapists often offer existentialist [[philosophy]] as an explanation for anxiety. The assertion is that anxiety is manifested of an individual's complete freedom to decide, and complete responsibility for the outcome of such decisions. Psychotherapists using an existentialist approach believe that a patient can harness his anxiety and use it constructively. Instead of suppressing anxiety, patients are advised to use it as grounds for change. By embracing anxiety as inevitable, a person can use it to achieve his full potential in life. [[Humanistic psychology]] also had major impetus from existentialist psychology and shares many of the fundamental tenets. [[Terror management theory]], based on the writings of [[Ernest Becker]] and [[Otto Rank]], is a developing area of study within the academic study of psychology. It looks at what researchers claim are implicit emotional reactions of people confronted with the knowledge that they will eventually die.

Also, [[Gerd B. Achenbach]] has refreshed the Socratic tradition with his own blend of [[philosophical counseling]]. So did [[Michel Weber]] with his Chromatiques Center in Belgium.

== Criticisms ==

=== General criticisms ===

[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] criticized 'the profoundly unsound methods and the dangerous contempt for reason that have been so prominent in existentialism.'&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Walter Arnold, From Shakespeare To Existentialism (Princeton University Press 1979), p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Logical positivists|Logical positivist]] philosophers, such as [[Rudolf Carnap]] and [[A. J. Ayer]], assert that existentialists are often confused about the verb "to be" in their analyses of "being".&lt;ref name="Carnap, Rudolf 1932 pp. 219"&gt;Carnap, Rudolf, ''Uberwindung der Metaphysik durch logische Analyse der Sprache'' [''Overcoming Metaphysics by the Logical Analysis of Speech''], Erkenntnis (1932), pp. 219–41. Carnap's critique of Heidegger's "What is Metaphysics".
&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, they argue that the verb "is" is transitive and pre-fixed to a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] (e.g., an apple ''is red'') (without a predicate, the word "is" is meaningless), and that existentialists frequently misuse the term in this manner. [[Colin Wilson]] has stated in his book ''The Angry Years'' that existentialism has created many of its own difficulties: "we can see how this question of freedom of the will has been vitiated by post-romantic philosophy, with its inbuilt tendency to laziness and [[boredom]], we can also see how it came about that existentialism found itself in a hole of its own digging, and how the philosophical developments since then have amounted to walking in circles round that hole".&lt;ref&gt;Colin, Wilson, ''The Angry Years'' (2007), p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sartre's philosophy===
Many critics argue [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s philosophy is contradictory. Specifically, they argue that Sartre makes metaphysical arguments despite his claiming that his philosophical views ignore metaphysics. [[Herbert Marcuse]] criticized Sartre's 1943 ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' for projecting anxiety and meaninglessness onto the nature of existence itself: "Insofar as Existentialism is a philosophical doctrine, it remains an idealistic doctrine: it [[hypostatic abstraction|hypostatizes]] specific historical conditions of human existence into ontological and metaphysical characteristics. Existentialism thus becomes part of the very ideology which it attacks, and its radicalism is illusory".&lt;ref name=Marcuse1972&gt;Marcuse, Herbert. "Sartre's Existentialism". Printed in ''Studies in Critical Philosophy''. Translated by Joris De Bres. London: NLB, 1972. p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Letter on Humanism'', [[Martin Heidegger]] criticized Sartre's existentialism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Existentialism says existence precedes essence. In this statement he is taking ''existentia'' and ''essentia'' according to their metaphysical meaning, which, from Plato's time on, has said that ''essentia'' precedes ''existentia''. Sartre reverses this statement. But the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement. With it, he stays with metaphysics, in oblivion of the truth of Being.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, "Letter on Humanism", in ''Basic Writings: Nine Key Essays, plus the Introduction to ''Being and Time'' '', trans. David Farrell Krell (London, Routledge; 1978), p. 208. [https://books.google.com/books?id=kVc9AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA208&amp;dq=But%20the%20reversal%20of%20a%20metaphysical%20statement%20remains%20a%20metaphysical%20statement.%20With%20it%2C%20he%20stays%20with%20metaphysics%2C%20in%20oblivion%20of%20the%20truth%20of%20Being.&amp;pg=PA208#v=onepage&amp;q=But%20the%20reversal%20of%20a%20metaphysical%20statement%20remains%20a%20metaphysical%20statement.%20With%20it,%20he%20stays%20with%20metaphysics,%20in%20oblivion%20of%20the%20truth%20of%20Being.

The term '''femininism''' (also capitalized as '''Femininism''') is related to the adjective [[feminine]]. The concept originates as far back as the 19th century. It is a philosophy of elevating and attempting to live by traits or virtues that accentuate the [[femininity]] of women, while still supporting intellectual equality between the sexes. It is acceptance of womanhood as strength.

Unlike the similar-sounding [[feminism]], ''femininism'' has a distinct meaning associated with gender differences rather than gender equality, though historically it has also been used to mean feminism.

Femininism is influenced by queer theory and disassociates female qualities from sex. It is a celebration of qualities typically considered female and supports the adoption of these qualities by both women and men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Athena doctrine :how women (and the men who think like them) will rule the future|last=Gerzema|first=John|last2=D'Antonio|first2=Michael|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=2013|isbn=9781118452950|location=San Francisco|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Emotion}}

'''Guilt''' is a [[cognitive]] or an [[emotion]]al experience that occurs when a person [[belief|believes]] or [[understanding|realizes]]—accurately or not—that they have compromised their own standards of conduct or have violated a universal [[Morality|moral]] standard and bear significant [[moral responsibility|responsibility]] for that violation.&lt;ref&gt;
Compare: {{cite web |url=http://www.enotes.com/gale-psychology-encyclopedia/guilt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502063427/http://www.enotes.com/gale-psychology-encyclopedia/guilt |archivedate=2 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }} "In psychology, what is "guilt," and what are the stages of guilt development?". eNotes.com. 2006. 31 December 2007: 'Let's begin with a working definition of guilt. Guilt is “an emotional state produced by thoughts that we have not lived up to our ideal self and could have done otherwise.”' Retrieved 2017-12-03.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Guilt is closely related to the concept of [[remorse]].

==Psychology==
Guilt is an important factor in perpetuating [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Leslie J. Shapiro, LICSW |url=https://www.aacp.com/Abstract.asp?AID=9322&amp;issue=February%202011&amp;page=C&amp;UID= |title=Pathological guilt: A persistent yet overlooked treatment factor in obsessive-compulsive disorder — |publisher=Aacp.com |accessdate=27 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201040951/https://www.aacp.com/Abstract.asp?AID=9322&amp;issue=February%202011&amp;page=C&amp;UID= |archivedate=1 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guilt and its associated causes, merits, and demerits are common themes in [[psychology]] and [[psychiatry]]. Both in specialized and in ordinary language, guilt is an affective state in which one experiences conflict at having done something that one believes one should not have done (or conversely, having not done something one believes one should have done). It gives rise to a feeling which does not go away easily, driven by '[[conscience]]'. [[Sigmund Freud]] described this as the result of a struggle between the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]] and the [[superego]]&amp;nbsp;– parental imprinting. Freud rejected the role of [[God]] as punisher in times of illness or rewarder in time of wellness. While removing one source of guilt from patients, he described another. This was the unconscious force within the individual that contributed to illness, Freud in fact coming to consider "the obstacle of an unconscious sense of guilt...as the most powerful of all obstacles to recovery."&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) pp. 390–1&lt;/ref&gt; For his later explicator, [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]], guilt was the inevitable companion of the signifying subject who acknowledged normality in the form of [[the Symbolic]] order.&lt;ref&gt;[[Catherine Belsey]], ''Shakespeare in Theory and Practice'' (2008) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alice Miller (psychologist)|Alice Miller]] claims that "many people suffer all their lives from this oppressive feeling of guilt, the sense of not having lived up to their parents' expectations....no argument can overcome these guilt feelings, for they have their beginnings in life's earliest period, and from that they derive their intensity."&lt;ref&gt;Alice Miller, ''The Drama of Being a Child'' (1995) pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt; This may be linked to what Les Parrott has called "the disease of false guilt....At the root of false guilt is the idea that what you ''feel'' must be true."&lt;ref&gt;Parrott, pp. 158–9&lt;/ref&gt; If you ''feel'' guilty, you must ''be'' guilty!

The philosopher [[Martin Buber]] underlined the difference between the [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] notion of guilt, based on internal conflicts, and ''existential guilt'', based on actual harm done to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Buber, M. |title=Guilt and guilt feelings |journal=Psychiatry |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=114–29 |date=May 1957 |pmid=13441838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guilt is often associated with [[anxiety]]. In [[mania]], according to [[Otto Fenichel]], the patient succeeds in applying to guilt "the defense mechanism of denial by overcompensation...re-enacts being a person without guilt feelings."&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) pp. 409–10&lt;/ref&gt;

In psychological research, guilt can be measured by using questionnaires, such as the [[Discrete emotion theory|Differential Emotions Scale]] (Izard's DES), or the [[Dutch Guilt Measurement Instrument]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |author=Van Laarhoven, H et al. | title=Comparison of attitudes of guilt and forgiveness in cancer patients without evidence of disease and advanced cancer patients in a palliative care setting |journal=Cancer Nursing |volume=35 |issue=6 |pages=483-492 |date=November–December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defenses===
Defenses against feeling guilt can become an overriding aspect of one's personality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]] ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 496&lt;/ref&gt;  The methods that can be used to avoid guilt are multiple.  They include:

===Lack of guilt in psychopaths===
Individuals high in [[psychopathy]] lack any true sense of guilt or [[remorse]] for harm they may have caused others. Instead, they [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalize]] their behavior, [[blame]] someone else, or [[Denial|deny]] it outright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Birket-Smith, Morten |author2=Millon, Theodore |author3=Simonsen, Erik |author4=Davis, Roger E. |chapter=11.

They have little ability to plan ahead for the future. An individual with psychopathy will never find themselves at fault because they will do whatever it takes to benefit themselves without reservation. A person that does not feel guilt or remorse would have no reason to find themselves at fault for something that they did with the intention of hurting another person. To a person high in psychopathy, their actions can always be rationalized to be the fault of another person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Neumann |first=Craig S. |author2=Kosson, David S. |author3=Forth, Adelle E. |author4=Hare, Robert D. |title=Factor structure of the Hare Psychopathy Checklist: Youth Version (PCL:YV) in adolescent females|journal=Psychological Assessment|year=2013|doi=10.1037/1040-3590.18.2.142 |volume=18 |pages=142–154}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen by psychologists as part of a lack of moral reasoning (in comparison with the majority of humans), an inability to evaluate situations in a moral framework, and an inability to develop emotional bonds with other people due to a lack of [[empathy]].

===Causes===

====Evolutionary theories====
Some evolutionary psychologists theorize that guilt and [[shame]] helped maintain beneficial relationships, such as [[reciprocal altruism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pallanti, S., Quercioli, L. |title=Shame and psychopathology |journal=CNS Spectr |volume=5 |issue=8 |pages=28–43 |date=August 2000 |pmid=18192938}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a person feels guilty when he harms another, or even fails to reciprocate kindness, he is more likely not to harm others or become too selfish. In this way, he reduces the chances of retaliation by members of his tribe, and thereby increases his survival prospects, and those of the tribe or group. As with any other emotion, guilt can be [[Psychological manipulation|manipulated]] to control or influence others. As highly social animals living in large, relatively stable groups, humans need ways to deal with conflicts and events in which they inadvertently or purposefully harm others. If someone causes harm to another, and then feels guilt and demonstrates regret and sorrow, the person harmed is likely to forgive. Thus, guilt makes it possible to forgive, and helps hold the social group together.

====Social psychology theories====
When we see another person suffering, it can also cause us pain. This constitutes our powerful system of empathy, which leads to our thinking that we should do something to relieve the suffering of others. If we cannot help another, or fail in our efforts, we experience feelings of guilt. From the perspective of group selection, groups that are made up of a high percentage of co-operators outdo groups with a low percentage of co-operators in between-group competition. People who are more prone to high levels of empathy-based guilt may be likely to suffer from anxiety and depression; however, they are also more likely to cooperate and behave altruistically. This suggests that guilt-proneness may not always be beneficial at the level of the individual, or within-group competition, but highly beneficial in between-group competition.{{Citation needed|reason=cf. Dearing, et al. in Addictive Behaviors Vol 30.7 for conflicting research.|date=December 2008}}

====Other theories====
Another common notion is that guilt is assigned by social processes, such as a [[jury trial]] (i. e., that it is a strictly legal concept). Thus, the ruling of a jury that [[O. J. Simpson]] or [[Julius Rosenberg]] was "guilty" or "not innocent" is taken as an actual judgment by the whole society that they must act as if they were so. By corollary, the ruling that such a person is "not guilty" may not be so taken, due to the asymmetry in the assumption that one is [[Presumption of innocence|assumed innocent until proven guilty]], and prefers to take the [[risk]] of freeing a guilty party over convicting innocents. Still others—often, but not always, theists of one type or another—believe that the origin of guilt comes from violating universal principles of right and wrong. In most instances, people who believe this also acknowledge that even though there is proper guilt from doing 'wrong' instead of doing 'right', people endure all sorts of guilty feelings which do not stem from violating universal moral principles.

==Collective guilt==

{{main|Collective responsibility}}
Collective guilt (or group guilt) is the unpleasant and often emotional reaction that results among a group of individuals when it is perceived that the group illegitimately harmed members of another group. It is often the result of “sharing a social identity with others whose actions represent a threat to the positivity of that identity.” For an individual to experience collective guilt, he must identify himself as a part of the in-group. “This produces a perceptual shift from thinking of oneself in terms of ‘I’ and ‘me’ to ‘us’ or ‘we’.”&lt;ref name="Collective"&gt;{{cite book |last=Branscombe |first=Nyla, R. |author2=Bertjan Doosje |year=2004
|title=Collective Guilt: International Perspectives |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-52083-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural views==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}
Traditional [[Culture of Japan|Japanese society]], [[Korean society]] and [[Chinese culture]]&lt;ref&gt;Bill Brugger, ''China, Liberation and Transformation'' (1981) pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; are sometimes said to be "[[shame]]-based" rather than "guilt-based", in that the social consequences of "getting caught" are seen as more important than the individual feelings or experiences of the agent (see the work of [[Ruth Benedict]]). The same has been said of [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek society]], a culture where, in [[Bruno Snell]]'s words, if "honour is destroyed the moral existence of the loser collapses."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in M. I. Finley, ''The World of Odysseus'' (1967) p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

This may lead to more of a focus on [[etiquette]] than on [[ethics]] as understood in Western civilization, leading some{{who|date=April 2012}} in Western civilizations to question why the word ''[[ethos]]'' was adapted from [[Ancient Greek]] with such vast differences in cultural norms. [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] inherit most notions of guilt from [[Judaism]]{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}, [[Ancient Persia|Persia]]n, and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ideas, mostly as interpreted through [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], who adapted [[Plato]]'s ideas to Christianity. The [[Latin]] word for guilt is ''culpa'', a word sometimes seen in law literature, for instance in ''mea culpa'' meaning "my fault (guilt)".

===Etymology===
Guilt, from [[Old English|O.E.]] ''gylt'' "crime, sin, fault, fine, debt", derived from O.E. ''gieldan'' "to pay for, debt". The mistaken use for "sense of guilt" is first recorded in 1690. "Guilt by association" is first recorded in 1941. "Guilty" is from O.E. ''gyltig'', from ''gylt''.

===In literature===
Guilt is a main theme in [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[East of Eden (novel)|East of Eden]]'', [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'', Tennessee Williams' ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Macbeth]]'', [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s "[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]" and "[[The Black Cat (short story)|The Black Cat]]", and many other works of literature. In Sartre's ''[[The Flies]]'', the Furies (in the form of flies) represent the morbid, strangling forces of neurotic guilt which bind us to authoritarian and totalitarian power.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Fagles trans., ''The Oresteia'' (Penguin 1981) p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

Guilt is a major theme in many works by [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], and is an almost universal concern of novelists who explore inner [[life]] and [[secret]]s.

===In the Christian Bible===
Guilt in the Christian [[Bible]] is not merely an emotional state but is a legal state of deserving punishment. The [[Hebrew Bible]] does not have a unique word for guilt, but uses a single word to signify: "sin, the guilt of it, the punishment due unto it, and a sacrifice for it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Owen, J. |chapter=Chapter 8|title=The Doctrine of Justification by Faith |publisher=Johnstone and Hunter |location=London |year=1850 |page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek [[New Testament]] uses a word for guilt that means "standing exposed to judgment for sin" (e. g., [[Romans 3]]:19). In what Christians call the "[[Old Testament]]", Christians believe the Bible teaches that, through sacrifice, one's sins can be forgiven (Judaism categorically rejects this idea, holding that forgiveness of sin is exclusively through repentance, and the role of sacrifices was for atonement of sins committed by accident or ignorance [http://www.shamash.org/lists/scj-faq/HTML/faq/11-08-02.html]). The New Testament says that this forgiveness is given as written in 1 Corinthians 15:3–4: "3 For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, for that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures." Some believe that the Old and New Testaments have differing opinions on the expiation of guilt because the Old Testaments were subject to the Age of Law and the New Testaments replace the Age of Law with the now current Age of Grace. However, both in the Old Testament and the New Testament salvation was granted based on God's grace and forgiveness (Gen 6:8; 19:19; Exo 33:12–17; 34:6–7). Animal sacrifices were only a symbol of the future sacrifice of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] (Heb 10:1–4; 9–12). The whole world is guilty before God for abandoning him and his ways (Rom 3:19). In Jesus Christ, God took upon himself the sins of the world and died on the cross to pay our debt (Rom 6:23). Those who repent and accept the sacrifice of Jesus Christ for their sins, will be redeemed by God and thus not guilty before him. They will be granted eternal life which will take effect when Jesus comes the second time (1 Thess 4:13–18). In contrast to surrounding nations which addressed their guilt with human sacrifice, the Israeli authors of the Bible called that an abomination (1 Kings 11:7, Jer 32:35). The Bible agrees with pagan cultures that guilt creates a cost that someone must pay (Heb 9:22). (This assumption was expressed in the previous section, "Defences": "Guilty people punish themselves if they have no opportunity to compensate the transgression that caused them to feel guilty. It was found that self-punishment did not occur if people had an opportunity to compensate the victim of their transgression.") But unlike pagan deities who demanded it be paid by humans, God, according to the Bible, loved us enough to pay it Himself, as a good father would, while calling us His "children" and calling Himself our "father" (Mat 5:45).

'''Homogamy''' is used in biology in four separate senses: 
*[[Inbreeding]] can be referred to as homogamy.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, P.M.B. (ed.) 1988. ''The Wordsworth Dictionary of Science and Technology''. W. R. Chambers Ltd. and Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Homogamy refers to the maturation of male and female reproductive organs at the same time, which is also known as simultaneous or synchronous [[hermaphrodite|hermaphrodism]] and is the antonym of [[dichogamy]]. Many flowers appear to be homogamous but some of these may not be strictly functionally homogamous, because for various reasons male and female reproduction do not completely overlap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bell, S.A. |author2=Cresswell, J.E. |year=1998|title=The phenology of gender in homogamous flowers: temporal change in the residual sex function of flowers of Oil-seed Rape (Brassica napus)|journal=Functional Ecology|volume=12|issue=2|pages=298–306|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2435.1998.00190.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the [[Asteraceae|daisy family]], the flower heads are made up of many small flowers called florets, and are either homogamous or heterogamous. '''Heterogamous heads''' are made up of two types of florets, ray florets near the edge and disk florets in the center. '''Homogamous heads''' are made up of just one type of floret, either all ray florets or all disk florets.
*Homogamy can be used as a form of choosing a mate based on characteristics that are wanted in a sexual partner.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Sterbová, Z., &amp; Valentová, J. (2012). Influence of homogamy, complementarity, and sexual imprinting on mate choice. ''Anthropologie, 50''(1), 47-59.

== Inbreeding ==
As opposed to [[outcrossing]] or outbreeding, [[inbreeding]] is the process by which organisms with common descent come together to mate and eventually procreate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/inbreeding|title=Inbreeding {{!}} genetics|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; An archetype of inbreeding is [[self-pollination]]. When a plant has both anthers and a stigma, the process of inbreeding can occur. Another word for this self-fertilization is [[autogamy]], which is when an anther releases pollen to attach to the stigma on the same plant. Self-pollination is promoted by homogamy. Homogamy is when the anthers and the stigma of a flower are being matured at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://agritech.tnau.ac.in/crop_improvement/crop_imprv_pollmode.html|title=TNAU Agritech Portal Crop Imporvement:: Mode of Pollination|last=|first=|date=|website=Agritech.tnau.ac.in|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The action of self-pollination guides the plant to [[homozygosity]], causing a specific gene to be received from each of the parents leading to the possession of two exact formats of that gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=12730|title=Definition of Homozygosity|work=MedicineNet|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assortative mating ==
[[Assortative mating]] is the choosing of a mate to breed with based on their physical characteristics, [[phenotypical]] traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/assortative-mating|title=Assortative mating {{!}} genetics|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are social factors that enhance one's choosing, such as religion, physical traits, and culture. For instance, research has been conducted by sociologists who found that men and women look for individuals who fall under the educational homogamy he or she is in. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.raniagihleb.com/resources/RESOURCES/marriage3k.pdf |title=Educational Homogamy and Assortative Mating Have Not Increased |last1=Gihleb |first1=Rania |last2=Lang |first2=Kevin |date= |website=raniagihleb.com |series=NBER Working Paper W22927 |access-date=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The homogamy theory holds that when organisms look for a potential partner, they search for organisms that have similar traits to themselves. The idea of sexual imprinting plays a role in this theory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Based on whether or not an individual is a male or a female, the individual tends to be attracted to other people that have most similar characteristics to their parent of the opposite gender. This is a form of [[Assortative mating|positive assortative mating]], where people choose a mate with attributes that correlate with their own. According to Kalmijn and Flap, there are five places individuals could become acquainted with each other in. These five places are: work, school, neighborhood, common family networks, and voluntary associations. They also studied the five criteria that are usually looked for to decide on the status of wanting to mate. As such, the five traits are: age, education, class destinations, class origins, and religious background.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Evolutionary aspect ==
&lt;p&gt;There is a evolutionary theory that explain that there are two specific qualities that are looked out. These two traits are male dominance and the attractiveness of the female. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Todd_Lucas/publication/239799863_Marital_satisfaction_in_four_cultures_as_a_function_of_homogamy_male_dominance_and_female_attractiveness/links/5547a7830cf2b0cf7ace7216.pdf|format=PDF|title=Marital satisfaction in four cultures as a function of homogamy, male dominance and female attractiveness|website=Researchgate.net|accessdate=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the evolutionary perspective, the purpose of mating is to procreate for the purpose of survival. It is the ones with the best features and traits that survive, a known phrase called [[survival of the fittest]]. If there was a couple who lacked the ability to become fertile or have a child with a disease or a handicap, there is a great rise in the risk of the couple receiving  a divorce. &lt;ref&gt;Littlefield, C.H. and Silverman, I. (1991) ‘Marital dissatisfaction following the death of a child: the influence of genetic factors at cause in the death’, Journal of Marriage and the Family 53: 799–804.&lt;/ref&gt; When there are traits that are found in a spouse that are not favorable, then the homogamy in the relationship decreases, and there begins to have a need for it for a better production of children.

An '''ideal''' is a [[principle]] or [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]] that one actively pursues as a [[goal]], usually in the context of [[ethics]], and one's prioritization of ideals can serve to indicate the extent of one's dedication to each. For example, someone who espouses the ideal of [[honesty]], but is willing to [[lie]] to protect a friend, demonstrates not only devotion to [[friendship]], but also belief in its supersedence of honesty in importance.

The belief in ideals is called '''ethical idealism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rescher|first=Nicholas|title=Ethical Idealism: An Inquiry into the Nature and Function of Ideals|year=1987|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, California|isbn=0520078888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In applied ethics==
In some theories of [[applied ethics]], such as that of [[Rushworth Kidder]], there is importance given to such orders as a way to [[dispute resolution|resolve disputes]].  In [[law]], for instance, a [[judge]] is sometimes called on to resolve the balance between the ideal of [[truth]], which would advise hearing out all evidence, and the ideal of fairness.

==In politics==
In [[politics]] ideals play a pivotal role.  During the [[French Revolution]], the principles of "[[Liberté, égalité, fraternité|Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood]]" were raised to the status of ideals. The [[Green_Party_of_the_United_States#Ideology|Ten Key Values of the US Green Party]] are likewise raised to such status today. In fact, most political movements have a certain set of ideals. However, in many cases, one can easily find instances where ideals were "not lived up to" - some of which are cases where one simply proved to outweigh another for some specific decision, or where all were compromised simply to retain the [[power (sociology)|power]] to continue to pursue them.

==Idols and heroes==
A different form of ideal is an [[idolatry|idol]] or [[hero]], who is held up as a [[moral example]].  Since this is an actual person or fictional character, it is too complex and multi-faceted to be considered an ideal in the abstract sense. However, when they are encountered in the form of a story, with only a few traits on display, they are a simplified [[archetype]] from which one can very easily derive [[stereotype]]s or mimicry.  In [[Islam]], for instance, the life of [[Muhammad]] is held up as "ideal", but must be interpreted for believers through the tale of his life, or [[Sirah Rasul Allah|sira]], and his many sayings, the [[hadith]].

==Ideal and virtue==
Given the complexity of putting ideals into practice, and resolving conflicts between them, it is not uncommon to see them reduced to [[dogma]]. One way to avoid this, according to [[Bernard Crick]], is to have ideals that themselves are descriptive of a process, rather than an outcome.  His [[political virtues]] try to raise the practical habits useful in resolving disputes into ideals of their own.  A [[virtue]], in general, is an ideal that one can make a [[habituation|habit]].

==Relative ideal==
In formal axiology, [[Robert S. Hartman]] contended that being ideal means that something is the best member of the set of all things of that class. For example, the ideal student is the best member of the set of all students in exactly the same way that the ideal circle is the best circle that can be imagined of the class of all circles. Since we can define the properties that the ideal member of a class should have, the value of any actual object can be empirically determined by comparing it to the ideal. The closer an object's actual properties match up to the properties of the ideal, the better the object is. For example, a bumpy circle drawn in the sand is not as "good" as a very smooth one drawn with a compass. In the world in general, each particular object ought to become more like its ideal. In [[ethics]], by analogy, each person should attempt to become more of an ideal person, and a person's morality can actually be measured by examining how close they live up to their ideal self.

Individualism makes the individual its focus&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; and so starts "with the fundamental premise that the human individual is of primary importance in the struggle for liberation."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Classical liberalism]], [[existentialism]], and [[anarchism]] are examples of movements that take the human individual as a central unit of analysis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[L. Susan Brown]]. ''[[The Politics of Individualism: Liberalism, Liberal Feminism, and Anarchism]]''. Black Rose Books Ltd. 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Individualism thus involves "the right of the individual to freedom and self-realization".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ellen Meiksins Wood]].

==Etymology==
In the [[English language]], the word "individualism" was first introduced, as a pejorative, by the [[Owenism|Owenites]] in the late 1830s, although it is unclear if they were influenced by [[Saint-Simonianism]] or came up with it independently.&lt;ref name="Claeys"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Claeys, Gregory |authorlink=Gregory Claeys |title="Individualism," "Socialism," and "Social Science": Further Notes on a Process of Conceptual Formation, 1800–1850 |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |year=1986 |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=81–93 |doi=10.2307/2709596|jstor=2709596|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more positive use of the term in Britain came to be used with the writings of [[James Elishama Smith]], who was a [[millenarian]] and a [[Christian Israelite]]. Although an early [[Robert Owen|Owenite]] socialist, he eventually rejected its collective idea of property, and found in individualism a "universalism" that allowed for the development of the "original genius." Without individualism, Smith argued, individuals cannot amass property to increase one's happiness.&lt;ref name="Claeys"/&gt; [[William Maccall]], another [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] preacher, and probably an acquaintance of Smith, came somewhat later, although influenced by [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Thomas Carlyle]], and [[Romanticism|German Romanticism]], to the same positive conclusions, in his 1847 work "Elements of Individualism".&lt;ref name="Swart"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Swart, Koenraad W. |author-link=Koenraad W. Swart |title="Individualism" in the Mid-Nineteenth Century (1826–1860) |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |year=1962 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=77–90 |doi=10.2307/2708058|jstor=2708058|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The individual==
{{Main|Individual}}
An individual is a person or any specific object in a collection. In the 15th century and earlier, and also today within the fields of [[statistics]] and [[metaphysics]], individual means "indivisible", typically describing any numerically singular thing, but sometimes meaning "a person." (q.v. "The problem of [[proper name]]s"). From the 17th century on, individual indicates separateness, as in individualism.&lt;ref&gt;Abbs 1986, cited in Klein 2005, pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; Individuality is the state or quality of being an individuated being; a person separated from everything with unique character by possessing his or her own needs, goals, and desires in comparison to other persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerald N. Izenberg|title=Impossible Individuality: Romanticism, Revolution, and the Origins of Modern Selfhood, 1787-1802|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TQ60DyQi8mYC&amp;pg=PA18|date=3 June 1992|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=1-4008-2066-9|pages=18+}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Individuation principle  ===
{{main|Individuation}}
The principle of individuation
, or ''{{lang|la|principium individuationis}}'',&lt;ref name=Reese&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Philosophy and Religion |last=Reese |first=William L. |edition=1st |year=1980 |publisher=Humanities Press |location=Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey |isbn=0-391-00688-6 |page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the manner in which a thing is identified as distinguished from other things.&lt;ref name=Cambridge&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy |editor1-last= Audi |editor1-first=Robert |edition= 2nd |year= 1999|publisher= Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-63136-X |page=424}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Carl Jung]], individuation is a process of transformation, whereby the personal and [[collective unconscious]] is brought into consciousness (by means of dreams, [[active imagination]] or [[free association (psychology)|free association]] to takexamples) to be assimilated into the whole personality. It is a completely natural process necessary for the integration of the psyche to take place.&lt;ref name="jung1"&gt;Jung, C. G. (1962). Symbols of Transformation: An analysis of the prelude to a case of schizophrenia (Vol. 2, R. F. C. Hull, Trans.). New York: Harper &amp; Brothers.&lt;/ref&gt; Jung considered individuation to be the central process of human development.&lt;ref name="Jung's Individuation process"&gt;[http://soultherapynow.com/articles/individuation.html Jung's Individuation process] Retrieved on 2009-2-20&lt;/ref&gt; In ''L'individuation psychique et collective'', [[Gilbert Simondon]] developed a theory of individual and collective individuation in which the individual subject is considered as an effect of individuation rather than a cause. Thus, the individual atom is replaced by a never-ending [[Process philosophy|ontological process]] of individuation. Individuation is an always incomplete process, always leaving a "pre-individual" left-over, itself making possible future individuations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilbert Simondon]]. ''L'individuation psychique et collective'' (Paris, Aubier, 1989; reprinted in 2007 with a preface by Bernard Stiegler)&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy of [[Bernard Stiegler]] draws upon and modifies the work of [[Gilbert Simondon]] on individuation and also upon similar ideas in [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]. For Stiegler "the ''I'', as a psychic individual, can only be thought in relationship to ''we'', which is a collective individual. The ''I'' is constituted in adopting a collective tradition, which it inherits and in which a plurality of ''I''&amp;nbsp;'s acknowledge each other's existence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/video/bernard-stiegler-culture-and-technology Bernard Stiegler: Culture and Technology], tate.org.uk, 13 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individualism and society==
Individualism holds that a person taking part in society attempts to learn and discover what his or her own interests are on a personal basis, without a presumed following of the interests of a societal structure (an individualist need not be an [[Egotism|egoist]]). The individualist does not follow one particular philosophy, rather creates an amalgamation of elements of many, based on personal interests in particular aspects that he/she finds of use. On a societal level, the individualist participates on a personally structured political and moral ground. Independent thinking and opinion is a common trait of an individualist. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], claims that his concept of "[[general will]]" in the "[[Social Contract (Rousseau)|social contract]]" is not the simple collection of individual wills and that it furthers the interests of the individual (the constraint of law itself would be beneficial for the individual, as the lack of respect for the law necessarily entails, in Rousseau's eyes, a form of [[ignorance]] and submission to one's [[Passion (emotion)|passions]] instead of the preferred [[wikt:autonomy|autonomy]] of [[reason]]).

Societies and groups can differ in the extent to which they are based upon predominantly "self-regarding" (individualistic, and/or self-interested) behaviors, rather than "other-regarding" (group-oriented, and group, or society-minded) behaviors. [[Ruth Benedict]] made a distinction, relevant in this context, between [[Guilt society|"guilt" societies]] (e.g., [[medieval Europe]]) with an "internal reference standard", and [[Shame society|"shame" societies]] (e.g., Japan, "bringing shame upon one's ancestors") with an "external reference standard", where people look to their peers for feedback on whether an action is "acceptable" or not.&lt;ref&gt;"The Chrysanthemum and the Sword: Patterns of Japanese Culture." Rutland, VT and Tokyo, Japan: Charles E. Tuttle Co. 1954 orig. 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individualism is often contrasted&lt;ref name="Hayek 1994 17, 37–48"/&gt; either with [[totalitarianism]] or with [[collectivism]], but in fact, there is a spectrum of behaviors at the societal level ranging from highly individualistic societies through mixed societies to collectivist.

===Methodological individualism===
[[Methodological individualism]] is the view that phenomena can only be understood by examining how they result from the motivations and actions of individual agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/methodological-individualism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Joseph|last=Heath|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=1 January 2015|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In economics, people's behavior is explained in terms of rational choices, as constrained by prices and incomes. The economist accepts individuals' preferences as givens. [[Gary Becker|Becker]] and [[George Stigler|Stigler]] provide a forceful statement of this view:&lt;blockquote&gt;On the traditional view, an explanation of economic phenomena that reaches a difference in tastes between people or times is the terminus of the argument: the problem is abandoned at this point to whoever studies and explains tastes (psychologists? anthropologists? phrenologists? sociobiologists?). On our preferred interpretation, one never reaches this impasse: the economist continues to search for differences in prices or incomes to explain any differences or changes in behavior.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stigler|first=George|author2=Gary Becker|date=Mar 1977|title=De gustibus non est disputandum|journal=American Economic Review|volume=67|issue=2|page=76|jstor=1807222}}&lt;/ref&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Competitive individualism===
It is a form of individualism that arises from competitive systems. The function of the system is to maintain an inequality in the society and fields of human engagement. This pins the ups and downs of a person's life onto themselves by not acknowledging a range of factors like influence of socioeconomic class, race, gender, etc. It supports the privilege theories that affirms position of certain individuals higher in the hierarchy of ranks at the expense of others. For better individuality cooperation is considered to be a better remedy for personal growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nancy Schniedewind|author2=Ellen Davidson|title=Open Minds to Equality: A Sourcebook of Learning Activities to Affirm Diversity and Promote Equity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nbc1aqFD88cC&amp;pg=PA23|year=2006|publisher=Rethinking Schools|isbn=978-0-942961-32-4|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political individualism==
{{quote box|align=right|width=30%|quote=With the abolition of private property, then, we shall have true, beautiful, healthy Individualism. Nobody will waste his life in accumulating things, and the symbols for things. One will live. To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.|source=[[Oscar Wilde]], ''[[The Soul of Man under Socialism]]'', 1891}}

Individualists are chiefly concerned with protecting individual autonomy against obligations imposed by social institutions (such as the state or religious morality). For [[L. Susan Brown]] "Liberalism and anarchism are two political philosophies that are fundamentally concerned with individual [[Freedom of will|freedom]] yet differ from one another in very distinct ways. Anarchism shares with liberalism a radical commitment to individual freedom while rejecting liberalism's competitive property relations."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Civil libertarianism]] is a strain of political thought that supports civil liberties, or which emphasizes the supremacy of [[individual rights]] and [[personal freedom]]s over and against any kind of authority (such as a [[State (polity)|state]], a [[corporation]], social norms imposed through [[peer pressure]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/civil%20libertarian?r=14|title=the definition of civil libertarian|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civil libertarianism is not a complete [[ideology]]; rather, it is a collection of views on the specific issues of [[civil liberties]] and [[civil rights]]. Because of this, a civil libertarian outlook is compatible with many other political philosophies, and civil libertarianism is found on both the [[Right-wing politics|right]] and [[Left-wing politics|left]] in modern politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politicalcompass.org/analysis2|title=The Political Compass|first=The Political|last=Compass|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For scholar [[Ellen Meiksins Wood]] "there are doctrines of individualism that are opposed to [[John Locke|Lockean individualism]] ... and non-lockean individualism may encompass [[socialism]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ellen Meiksins Wood]]. ''Mind and Politics: An Approach to the Meaning of Liberal and Socialist Individualism''. [[University of California Press]]. 1972.  {{ISBN|0-520-02029-4}}. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

British Historians Emily Robinson, Camilla Schofield, Florence Sutcliffe-Braithwaite, and Natalie Thomlinson have argued that by the 1970s Britons were keen about defining and claiming their individual rights, identities and perspectives.  They demanded greater personal autonomy and self-determination and less outside control. They angrily complained that the 'establishment' was withholding it.  They argue this shift in concerns helped cause [[Thatcherism]], and was incorporated into Thatcherism's appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Robinson, et al. "Telling stories about post-war Britain:  popular individualism and the 'crisis' of the 1970s." ''Twentieth Century British History'' 28.2 (2017): 268-304.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberalism===
{{main|Liberalism}}
{{Liberalism sidebar |Ideas}}
Liberalism (from the Latin ''liberalis'', "of freedom; worthy of a free man, gentlemanlike, courteous, generous")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/lookup.pl?stem=liberalis&amp;ending=|title=Latin Word Lookup|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the belief in the importance of individual freedom. This belief is widely accepted in the United States, Europe, Australia and other [[Western world|Western]] nations, and was recognized as an important value by many Western philosophers throughout history, in particular since [[the Enlightenment]]. It is often rejected by collectivist, Islamic, or [[confucian]] societies in [[Asia]] or the [[Middle East]] (though [[Taoist]]s were and are known to be individualists).&lt;ref&gt;The Ancient Chinese Super State of Primary Societies: Taoist Philosophy for the 21st Century, You-Sheng Li, June 2010, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] wrote praising "the idea of a polity administered with regard to equal rights and equal freedom of speech, and the idea of a kingly government which respects most of all the freedom of the governed".&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Aurelius, ''Meditations'', Oxford University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-19-954059-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For all intents and purposes, liberalism here refers to classical liberalism and should not be confused with [[modern liberalism in the United States]],.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Goodman, {{cite web|url=http://www.goodmaninstitute.org/how-we-think/classical-liberalism-vs-modern-liberalism-and-modern-conservatism/|title=Classical Liberalism vs Modern Liberalism and Modern Conservatism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberalism has its roots in the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and rejects many [[Foundationalism|foundational]] assumptions that dominated most earlier theories of government, such as the [[Divine Right of Kings]], hereditary status, and [[state religion|established religion]]. [[John Locke]] is often credited with the philosophical foundations of [[classical liberalism]]. He wrote "no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions."&lt;ref name = "locke"&gt;{{cite book | last = Locke | first = John | title = Two Treatises of Government (10th edition) | publisher = [[Project Gutenberg]] | year = 1690 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/trgov10h.htm | accessdate = January 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, liberal ideas began to influence governments in Europe, in nations such as The Netherlands, Switzerland, England and Poland, but they were strongly opposed, often by armed might, by those who favored absolute monarchy and established religion. In the 18th century, in America, the first modern liberal state was founded, without a monarch or a hereditary aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Paul E. Sigmund, editor, ''The Selected Political Writings of John Locke'', Norton, 2003, {{ISBN|0-393-96451-5}} p. iv "(Locke's thoughts) underlie many of the fundamental political ideas of American liberal constitutional democracy...", "At the time Locke wrote, his principles were accepted in theory by a few and in practice by none."&lt;/ref&gt; The American ''Declaration of Independence'' includes the words (which echo Locke) "all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are [[life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness]]; that to insure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the [[consent of the governed]]."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jefferson, ''Declaration of Independence'', July 4, 1776.&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberalism comes in many forms. According to [[John N. Gray]], the essence of liberalism is toleration of different beliefs and of different ideas as to what constitutes a good life.&lt;ref&gt;John Gray, ''Two Faces of Liberalism'', The New Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-56584-678-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl Marx."

For influential Italian anarchist [[Errico Malatesta]] "All anarchists, whatever tendency they belong to, are individualists in some way or other. But the opposite is not true; not by any means. The individualists are thus divided into two distinct categories: one which claims the right to full development for all human individuality, their own and that of others; the other which only thinks about its own individuality and has absolutely no hesitation in sacrificing the individuality of others. The Tsar of all the Russias belongs to the latter category of individualists.

====Individualist anarchism====
{{Main|Individualist anarchism}}
Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the individual and their [[will (philosophy)|will]] over any kinds of external determinants such as groups, society, traditions, and ideological systems.&lt;ref name="ryner"&gt;"What do I mean by individualism?
I mean by individualism the moral doctrine which, relying on no dogma, [[loss of tradition|no tradition]], no external determination, appeals only to the individual conscience."[https://www.marxists.org/archive/ryner/1905/mini-manual.htm ''Mini-Manual of Individualism'' by Han Ryner]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tucker"&gt;"I do not admit anything except the existence of the individual, as a condition of his sovereignty. To say that the sovereignty of the individual is conditioned by Liberty is simply another way of saying that it is conditioned by itself." "Anarchism and the State" in ''Individual Liberty''&lt;/ref&gt; Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict.

In 1793, [[William Godwin]], who has often&lt;ref&gt;Everhart, Robert B. The Public School Monopoly: A Critical Analysis of Education and the State in American Society. Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research, 1982. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; been cited as the first anarchist, wrote ''[[Political Justice]]'', which some consider to be the first expression of anarchism.&lt;ref name="godwinsep" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Ian. Political Ideology Today. Manchester University Press, 2001. p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;
Godwin, a philosophical anarchist, from a [[Rationalism|rationalist]] and [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a [[Limited government|minimal state]] as a present "necessary evil" that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge.&lt;ref name="godwinsep"&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=godwin |title=William Godwin |last=Philip  |first=Mark|date=2006-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and its Influence on Modern Morals and Manners |last=Godwin |first=William |authorlink=William Godwin |year=1796 |publisher=G.G. and J.

Godwin advocated individualism, proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good.&lt;ref&gt;''Britannica Concise Encyclopedia''.

Liverpool University Press, 2006, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; or egoist anarchism, was expounded by one of the earliest and best-known proponents of individualist anarchism, the German [[Max Stirner]].&lt;ref name="SEP-Stirner"&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=max-stirner |title=Max Stirner |last=Leopold  |first=David|date=2006-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stirner's ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'', published in 1844, is a founding text of the philosophy.&lt;ref name="SEP-Stirner"/&gt; According to Stirner, the only limitation on the rights of the individual is their power to obtain what they desire,&lt;ref name="The Encyclopedia Americana p. 176"&gt;The Encyclopedia Americana: A Library of Universal Knowledge.

Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862), uno de los escritores próximos al movimiento de la filosofía trascendentalista, es uno de los más conocidos. Su obra más representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una cabaña en el bosque, y vivir en íntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosofía trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armonía de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por Jonh Zerzan. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar también motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX."[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf "Voluntary non-submission.

He is best known for his books ''[[Walden]]'', a reflection upon [[simple living]] in natural surroundings, and his essay, ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'', an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. Later [[Benjamin Tucker]] fused Stirner's egoism with the economics of Warren and Proudhon in his eclectic influential publication ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]''.

==Philosophical individualism==

===Ethical egoism===
{{Main|Ethical egoism}}
Ethical egoism (also called simply egoism)&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, Steven M. Is egoism morally defensible? Philosophia. Springer Netherlands. Volume 18, Numbers 2–3 / July 1988&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[normative ethics|normative ethical]] position that [[moral agent]]s ought to do what is in their own [[wikt:self-interest|self-interest]]. It differs from [[psychological egoism]], which claims that [[people]] ''do'' only act in their self-interest. Ethical egoism also differs from [[rational egoism]], which holds merely that it is [[rationality|rational]] to act in one's self-interest. However, these doctrines may occasionally be combined with ethical egoism.

Ethical egoism contrasts with ethical [[altruism (ethics)|altruism]], which holds that moral agents have an [[obligation]] to help and serve others. Egoism and altruism both contrast with ethical utilitarianism, which holds that a moral agent should treat one's [[self (philosophy)|self]] (also known as [[subject (philosophy)|the subject]]) with no higher regard than one has for others (as egoism does, by elevating self-interests and "the self" to a status not granted to others), but that one also should not (as altruism does) sacrifice one's own interests to help others' interests, so long as one's own interests (i.e. one's own [[desire (philosophy)|desires]] or [[well-being]]) are substantially-equivalent to the others' interests and well-being. Egoism, utilitarianism, and altruism are all forms of [[consequentialism]], but egoism and altruism contrast with utilitarianism, in that egoism and altruism are both [[Consequentialism#Agent-focused or agent-neutral|agent-focused]] forms of consequentialism (i.e. subject-focused or [[subjectivity|subjective]]), but utilitarianism is called agent-neutral (i.e. [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and [[impartial]]) as it does not treat the subject's (i.e. the self's, i.e. the moral "agent's") own interests as being more or less important than if the same interests, desires, or well-being were anyone else's.

Ethical egoism does not, however, require moral agents to harm the interests and well-being of others when making moral deliberation; e.g. what is in an agent's self-interest may be incidentally detrimental, beneficial, or neutral in its effect on others. Individualism allows for others' interest and well-being to be disregarded or not, as long as what is chosen is efficacious in satisfying the self-interest of the agent. Nor does ethical egoism necessarily [[logical consequence|entail]] that, in pursuing self-interest, one ought always to do what one wants to do; e.g. in the long term, the fulfilment of short-term desires may prove detrimental to the self. Fleeting pleasance, then, takes a back seat to protracted [[eudaemonia]]. In the words of [[James Rachels]], "Ethical egoism [...] endorses selfishness, but it doesn't endorse foolishness."&lt;ref name="Rachels 2008, p. 534"&gt;Rachels 2008, p. 534.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stirner02.jpg|thumb|right|Caricature of [[Max Stirner]] taken from a sketch by [[Friedrich Engels]]. Egoist philosopher Max Stirner has been called a proto-[[existentialist]] philosopher while at the same time is a central theorist of individualist anarchism]]
Ethical egoism is sometimes the philosophical basis for support of [[libertarianism]] or individualist anarchism as in Max Stirner, although these can also be based on altruistic motivations.&lt;ref name=ridgely&gt;{{cite web

===Existentialism===
{{Main|Existentialism}}
Existentialism is a term applied to the work of a number of [[19th century philosophy|19th-]] and [[20th century philosophy|20th-century philosophers]] who, despite profound doctrinal differences,&lt;ref&gt;Macquarrie, John. ''Existentialism'', New York (1972), pp. 18–21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Companion to Philosophy'', ed. Ted Honderich, New York (1995), p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; generally held that the focus of philosophical thought should be to deal with the conditions of existence of the individual person and his or her emotions, actions, responsibilities, and thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;Macquarrie. ''Existentialism'', pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, D. E. ''Existentialism: A Reconstruction'' (Basil Blackwell, 1999, p. 8)&lt;/ref&gt; The early 19th century philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]], posthumously regarded as the father of existentialism,&lt;ref&gt;Marino, Gordon. ''Basic Writings of Existentialism'' (Modern Library, 2004, pp. ix, 3).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kierkegaard/&lt;/ref&gt; maintained that the individual solely has the responsibilities of giving one's own life [[Meaning (existential)|meaning]] and living that life [[Authenticity (philosophy)|passionately and sincerely]],&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Michael. ''Kierkegaard'' (Oneworld, 2003, pp. 4–6).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lowrie, Walter. ''Kierkegaard's attack upon "Christendom"'' (Princeton, 1968, pp. 37–40)&lt;/ref&gt; in spite of many existential obstacles and distractions including [[Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard#Despair|despair]], [[angst]], [[Absurdism|absurdity]], [[Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard#Alienation|alienation]], and [[boredom]].&lt;ref&gt;Corrigan, John. ''The Oxford handbook of religion and emotion'' (Oxford, 2008, pp. 387–88)&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent existential philosophers retain the emphasis on the individual, but differ, in varying degrees, on how one achieves and what constitutes a fulfilling life, what obstacles must be overcome, and what external and internal factors are involved, including the potential consequences of the [[Christian existentialism|existence]]&lt;ref&gt;Livingston, James et al. ''Modern Christian Thought: The Twentieth Century'' (Fortress Press, 2006, Chapter 5: Christian Existentialism).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Clancy.

Cooper ''Existentialism: A Reconstruction'' (Basil Blackwell, 1999, p. 8).&lt;/ref&gt; Many existentialists have also regarded traditional systematic or academic philosophy, in both style and content, as too abstract and remote from concrete human experience.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Breisach, ''Introduction to Modern Existentialism'', New York (1962), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kaufmann, ''Existentialism: From Dostoevesky to Sartre'', New York (1956), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Existentialism became fashionable after [[World War II]] as a way to reassert the importance of human individuality and freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Guignon, Charles B. and Derk Pereboom. ''Existentialism: basic writings'' (Hackett Publishing, 2001, p. xiii)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freethought===
{{Main|Freethought}}
Freethought holds that individuals should not accept ideas proposed as [[truth]] without recourse to knowledge and [[reason]]. Thus, freethinkers strive to build their opinions on the basis of [[fact]]s, [[scientific method|scientific inquiry]], and [[logic]]al principles, independent of any logical [[fallacy|fallacies]] or intellectually limiting effects of authority, [[confirmation bias]], [[cognitive bias]], [[conventional wisdom]], [[popular culture]], [[prejudice]], [[sect]]arianism, [[tradition]], [[urban legend]], and all other [[dogma]]s. Regarding [[religion]], freethinkers hold that there is insufficient evidence to scientifically validate the existence of [[supernatural]] phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, James. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZAwwaxdKMNAC Encyclopedia of Religion]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanism===
{{Main|Humanism}}
Humanism is a perspective common to a wide range of [[ethics|ethical stances]] that attaches importance to human dignity, concerns, and capabilities, particularly rationality. Although the word has many senses, its meaning comes into focus when contrasted to the supernatural or to appeals to authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Compact Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|quote=humanism ''n.'' 1 a rationalistic system of thought attaching prime importance to human rather than divine or supernatural matters. 2 a Renaissance cultural movement that turned away from medieval scholasticism and revived interest in ancient Greek and Roman thought.|publication-date = 2007}} Typically, abridgments of this definition omit all senses except #1, such as in the [http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=38402&amp;dict=CALD Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary], [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/humanism Collins Essential English Dictionary], and {{cite book|title=Webster's Concise Dictionary|publisher=RHR Press|year = 2001|location=New York|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definitions of humanism (subsection) |publisher=Institute for Humanist Studies |url=http://humaniststudies.org/humphil.html |accessdate=16 Jan 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070118050402/http://humaniststudies.org/humphil.html |archivedate=2007-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 19th century, humanism has been associated with an anti-clericalism inherited from the 18th-century Enlightenment ''[[philosophes]]''. 21st century Humanism tends to strongly endorse [[human rights]], including [[reproductive rights]], [[gender equality]], [[social justice]], and the [[separation of church and state]].

===Hedonism===
{{Main|Hedonism}}
Philosophical hedonism is a meta-ethical theory of value which argues that [[pleasure]] is the only [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic good]] and pain is the only intrinsic bad.&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2013/entries/hedonism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Andrew|last=Moore|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic idea behind hedonistic thought is that pleasure (an umbrella term for all inherently likable emotions) is the only thing that is good in and of itself or by its very nature.  This implies evaluating the moral worth of character or behavior according to the extent that the pleasure it produces exceeds the pain it entails.  &lt;!-- This last sentence was:  "The normative implications of this are evaluating character or behavior as morally good to the extent that one is concerned with pleasure/pain qua pleasure/pain or an action leads to a greater balance of pleasure over pain than any other would." --&gt;

===Libertinism===
{{Main|Libertine}}
A libertine is one devoid of most moral restraints, which are seen as unnecessary or undesirable, especially one who ignores or even spurns accepted morals and forms of behaviour sanctified by the larger society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/libertine|title=libertine|publisher=|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=libertine|title=WordNet Search - 3.1|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libertines place value on physical pleasures, meaning those experienced through the senses. As a philosophy, libertinism gained new-found adherents in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, particularly in [[France]] and [[Great Britain]]. Notable among these were [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester]], and the [[Marquis de Sade]]. During the [[Baroque era]] in France, there existed a [[Freethought|freethinking]] circle of philosophers and intellectuals who were collectively known as ''libertinage érudit'' and which included [[Gabriel Naudé]], [[Élie Diodati]] and [[François de La Mothe Le Vayer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=René Pintard|title=Le Libertinage érudit dans la première moitié du XVIIe siècle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IeL29wMqdbgC&amp;pg=PA11|accessdate=24 July 2012|year=2000|publisher=Slatkine|isbn=978-2-05-101818-0|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/fideism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Richard|last=Amesbury|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=1 January 2016|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critic [[Vivian de Sola Pinto]] linked [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester]]'s libertinism to [[Hobbesian]] [[materialism]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/02/20/specials/greene-monkey.html A Martyr to Sin]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Objectivism===
{{Libertarianism sidebar |Concepts}}
{{Main|Objectivism (Ayn Rand)}}
[[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] is a system of philosophy created by philosopher and novelist [[Ayn Rand]] (1905–1982) that holds: [[reality]] exists independent of consciousness; human beings gain knowledge rationally from perception through the process of concept formation and inductive and deductive logic; the moral purpose of one's life is the pursuit of one's own happiness or rational self-interest. Rand thinks the only social system consistent with this morality is full respect for individual rights, embodied in pure ''[[laissez faire]]'' [[capitalism]]; and the role of [[art]] in human life is to transform man's widest metaphysical ideas, by selective reproduction of reality, into a physical form—a work of art—that he can comprehend and to which he can respond emotionally. Objectivism celebrates man as his own hero, "with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute."&lt;ref&gt;"About the Author" in {{harvnb|Rand|1992|pp=1170–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophical anarchism===
{{Main|Philosophical anarchism}}
[[File:BenjaminTucker.jpg|upright=0.8|left|thumb|[[Benjamin Tucker]], American individualist anarchist who focused on economics calling them "Anarchistic-Socialism"&lt;ref&gt;Tucker said, ''"the fact that one class of men are dependent for their living upon the sale of their labour, while another class of men are relieved of the necessity of labour by being legally privileged to sell something that is not labour. . . . And to such a state of things I am as much opposed as any one. But the minute you remove privilege. . . every man will be a labourer exchanging with fellow-labourers . . . What Anarchistic-Socialism aims to abolish is usury . . . it wants to deprive capital of its reward."''Benjamin Tucker. ''Instead of a Book'', p. 404&lt;/ref&gt; and adhering to the [[Mutualism (economy)|mutualist]] economics of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Josiah Warren]]]]
Philosophical anarchism is an [[anarchist school of thought]]&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Gabardi, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1957102 review] of ''Anarchism'' by David Miller, published in ''American Political Science Review'' Vol. 80, No. 1. (Mar., 1986), pp. 300—02.&lt;/ref&gt; which contends that the [[Sovereign state|State]] lacks [[legitimacy (political)|moral legitimacy]] and – in contrast to revolutionary anarchism – does not advocate violent revolution to eliminate it but advocates peaceful evolution to superate it.&lt;ref&gt;According to scholar [[Allan Antliff]], Benjamin Tucker coined the term "philosophical anarchism," to distinguish peaceful evolutionary anarchism from revolutionary variants. ''Antliff, Allan. 2001. [https://books.google.com/books?id=dQTk-N4JWbYC Anarchist Modernism: Art, Politics, and the First American Avant-Garde]. University of Chicago Press. p. 4''&lt;/ref&gt; Though philosophical anarchism does not necessarily imply any action or desire for the elimination of the State, philosophical anarchists do not believe that they have an obligation or duty to obey the State, or conversely, that the State has a right to command.

Philosophical anarchism is a component especially of individualist anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William &amp; Tourain, Alain (Eds.). (2003). Anarchism. The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought (2nd Edition, p. 12). Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophical anarchists of historical note include [[Mohandas Gandhi]], William Godwin, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Max Stirner,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Freeden identifies four broad types of individualist anarchism. He says the first is the type associated with William Godwin that advocates [[self-government]] with a "progressive rationalism that included benevolence to others." The second type is the amoral self-serving rationality of [[Egotism|Egoism]], as most associated with Max Stirner. The third type is "found in [[Herbert Spencer]]'s early predictions, and in that of some of his disciples such as [[Wordsworth Donisthorpe|Donisthorpe]], foreseeing the redundancy of the state in the source of social evolution." The fourth type retains a moderated form of Egoism and accounts for social cooperation through the advocacy of market. ''Freeden, Michael.

Thoreau's Proposals for Legislation. American Quarterly, Vol. 7, No. 3 (Autumn, 1955). p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary philosophical anarchists include A. John Simmons and [[Robert Paul Wolff]].

===Subjectivism===
{{Main|Subjectivism}}
Subjectivism is a philosophical tenet that accords primacy to subjective experience as fundamental of all measure and law. In extreme forms like [[Solipsism]], it may hold that the nature and existence of every object depends solely on someone's subjective awareness of it. For example, [[Wittgenstein]] wrote in [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]: "The subject doesn't belong to the world, but it is a limit of the world" (proposition 5.632). Metaphysical subjectivism is the theory that reality is what we perceive to be real, and that there is no underlying true reality that exists independently of perception. One can also hold that it is [[consciousness]] rather than perception that is reality ([[subjective idealism]]). In [[probability]], a subjectivism stands for the belief that probabilities are simply degrees-of-belief by rational agents in a certain proposition, and which have no objective reality in and of themselves.

[[Ethical subjectivism]] stands in opposition to [[moral realism]], which claims that moral propositions refer to objective facts, independent of human opinion; to [[error theory]], which denies that any moral propositions are true in any sense; and to [[non-cognitivism]], which denies that moral sentences express propositions at all. The most common forms of ethical subjectivism are also forms of [[moral relativism]], with moral standards held to be relative to each culture or society (c.f. [[cultural relativism]]), or even to every individual. The latter view, as put forward by [[Protagoras]], holds that there are as many distinct scales of good and evil as there are subjects in the world. Moral subjectivism is that species of moral relativism that relativizes moral value to the individual subject.

[[Horst Matthai Quelle]]  was a [[Spanish language]] [[Germany|German]] anarchist [[philosophy|philosopher]] influenced by [[Max Stirner]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com.ec"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=E6JFPiDRlikC&amp;pg=PA345&amp;lpg=PA345#v=onepage&amp;q=horst%20matthai%20el%20humanismo%20como%20problema%20humano Horst Matthai Quelle. ''Textos Filosóficos (1989-1999)''. p. 15]&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that since the individual gives form to the world, he is those objects, the others and the whole universe.&lt;ref name="books.google.com.ec"/&gt; One of his main views was a "theory of infinite worlds" which for him was developed by [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-socratic philosophers]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com.ec"/&gt;

====Solipsism====
{{Main|Solipsism}}
Solipsism is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] idea that only one's own [[mind]] is sure to exist. The term comes from [[Latin]] ''solus'' (alone) and ''ipse'' (self). Solipsism as an [[epistemology|epistemological]] position holds that [[knowledge]] of anything outside one's own mind is unsure. [[Philosophical skepticism|The external world]] and [[problem of other minds|other minds]] cannot be known, and might not exist outside the mind. As a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] position, solipsism goes further to the conclusion that the world and other minds do not exist. As such it is the only epistemological position that, by its own [[wikt:postulate#Pronunciation|postulate]], is both [[wikt:irrefutable#English|irrefutable]] and yet indefensible in the same manner. Although the number of individuals sincerely espousing solipsism has been small, it is not uncommon for one philosopher to accuse another's arguments of entailing solipsism as an unwanted consequence, in a kind of [[reductio ad absurdum]]. In the history of philosophy, solipsism has served as a [[skeptical hypothesis]].

==Economic individualism==
The [[doctrine]] of economic individualism holds that each individual should be allowed [[autonomy]] in making his or her own economic decisions as opposed to those decisions being made by the state, the [[community]], the corporation etc. for him or her.

===Liberalism===
{{Main|Liberalism}}
Classical liberalism is a political ideology that developed in the 19th century in [[England]], [[Western Europe]], and the [[Americas]]. It followed earlier forms of liberalism in its commitment to personal freedom and popular government, but differed from earlier forms of liberalism in its commitment to [[free markets]] and [[classical economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=sq-1z8VMhDEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage|title=Modern Political Philosophy|first=Richard|last=Hudelson|date=1 January 1999|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable classical liberals in the 19th century include [[Jean-Baptiste Say]], [[Thomas Malthus]], and [[David Ricardo]]. Classical liberalism was revived in the 20th century by [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]], and further developed by [[Milton Friedman]], [[Robert Nozick]], [[Loren Lomasky]], and [[Jan Narveson]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Conway (academic)|David Conway]]. ''Classical Liberalism: The Unvanquished Ideal.'' Palgrave Macmillan. 1998. {{ISBN|978-0-312-21932-1}} p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ''classical liberalism'' is also sometimes used to refer to all forms of liberalism before the 20th century.

===Individualist anarchism and economics===
[[File:Emilearmand01.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.9|Influential [[Individualist anarchism in France|French individualist anarchist]] [[Emile Armand]]]]
In regards to economic questions within individualist anarchism there are adherents to [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] ([[Pierre Joseph Proudhon]], [[Emile Armand]], early Benjamin Tucker); [[natural rights]] positions (early Benjamin Tucker, [[Lysander Spooner]], Josiah Warren); and egoistic disrespect for "ghosts" such as private property and markets (Max Stirner, [[John Henry Mackay]], [[Lev Chernyi]], later Benjamin Tucker, [[Renzo Novatore]], [[illegalism]]). Contemporary individualist anarchist [[Kevin Carson]] characterizes American individualist anarchism saying that "Unlike the rest of the [[socialist]] movement, the individualist anarchists believed that the natural wage of labor in a free market was its product, and that economic exploitation could only take place when capitalists and landlords harnessed the power of the state in their interests. Thus, individualist anarchism was an alternative both to the increasing statism of the mainstream socialist movement, and to a [[classical liberal]] movement that was moving toward a mere apologetic for the power of big business." &lt;ref&gt;Kevin Carson. ''Organization Theory: A Libertarian Perspective''. BOOKSURGE. 2008. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mutualism====
{{main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}
Mutualism is an [[anarchist school of thought]] which can be traced to the writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who envisioned a society where each person might possess a [[means of production]], either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in the [[free market]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mutualist.org/ Mutualist.org Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt; Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank which would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate only high enough to cover the costs of administration.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, David. 1987. "Mutualism." The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought. Blackwell Publishing. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualism is based on a [[labor theory of value]] which holds that when labor or its product is sold, in exchange, it ought to receive goods or services embodying "the amount of labor necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility".&lt;ref&gt;Tandy, Francis D., 1896, ''[[Voluntary Socialism]]'', chapter 6, paragraph 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Receiving anything less would be considered exploitation, theft of labor, or [[usury]].

Anarchism is distinguished, philosophically, by its scepticism towards such moral relations – by its questioning of the claims made for such normative power – and, practically, by its challenge to those "authoritative" powers which cannot justify their claims and which are therefore deemed illegitimate or without moral foundation."[https://books.google.com/books?id=kkj5i3CeGbQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage ''Anarchism and Authority: A Philosophical Introduction to Classical Anarchism'' by Paul McLaughlin.

Marx went one way; Warren and Proudhon the other. Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism...Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl Marx."

Pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"In some ways, it is perhaps fair to say that if Left communism is an intellectual- political formation, it is so, first and foremost, negatively – as opposed to other socialist traditions. I have labelled this negative pole 'socialist orthodoxy', composed of both Leninists and social democrats...What I suggested was that these Left communist thinkers differentiated their own understandings of communism from a strand of socialism that came to follow a largely electoral road in the West, pursuing a kind of social capitalism, and a path to socialism that predominated in the peripheral and semi- peripheral countries, which sought revolutionary conquest of power and led to something like state capitalism. Generally, the Left communist thinkers were to find these paths locked within the horizons of capitalism (the law of value, money, private property, class, the state), and they were to characterize these solutions as statist, substitutionist and authoritarian."

===Right-libertarianism===
{{Objectivist movement}}
{{Main|Right-libertarianism}}
Right-libertarianism or right libertarianism is a phrase used by some to describe either non-[[collectivist]] forms of libertarianism&lt;ref&gt;Serena Olsaretti, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NZmGrPKu8BMC Liberty, Desert and the Market: A Philosophical Study], Cambridge University Press, 2004, 14, 88, 100.&lt;/ref&gt; or a variety of different libertarian views some label "right" of mainstream libertarianism including "[[libertarian conservatism]]".

Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy calls it "right libertarianism" but states: "Libertarianism is often thought of as 'right-wing' doctrine. This, however, is mistaken for at least two reasons. First, on social—rather than economic—issues, libertarianism tends to be 'left-wing'. It opposes laws that restrict consensual and private sexual relationships between adults (e.g., gay sex, non-marital sex, and deviant sex), laws that restrict drug use, laws that impose religious views or practices on individuals, and compulsory military service. Second, in addition to the better-known version of libertarianism—right-libertarianism—there is also a version known as '[[left-libertarianism]]'. Both endorse full self-ownership, but they differ with respect to the powers agents have to appropriate unappropriated natural resources (land, air, water, etc.)."&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] entry on [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism Libertarianism], [[Stanford University]], July 24, 2006 version.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As creative independent lifestyle==
[[File:Oscar Wilde portrait.jpg|upright=0.7|left|thumb|[[Oscar Wilde]], famous [[Irish people|Irish]] [[socialist]] writer of the [[decadent movement]] and famous [[dandy]]]]
The anarchist&lt;ref&gt;"The most ambitious contribution to literary anarchism during the 1890s was undoubtedly Oscar Wilde ''The Soul of Man under Socialism''. Wilde, as we have seen, declared himself an anarchist on at least one occasion during the 1890s, and he greatly admired [[Peter Kropotkin]], whom he had met. Later, in ''De Profundis'', he described Kropotkin's life as one "of the most perfect lives I have come across in my own experience" and talked of him as "a man with a soul of that beautiful white Christ that seems coming out of Russia." But in ''The Soul of Man under Socialism'', which appeared in 1890, it is Godwin rather than Kropotkin whose influence seems dominant." George Woodcock. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements.'' 1962. (p. 447)&lt;/ref&gt; writer and [[bohemianism|bohemian]] [[Oscar Wilde]] wrote in his famous essay ''[[The Soul of Man under Socialism]]'' that "Art is individualism, and individualism is a disturbing and disintegrating force. There lies its immense value. For what it seeks is to disturb monotony of type, slavery of custom, tyranny of habit, and the reduction of man to the level of a machine."&lt;ref name="flag.blackened.net"/&gt; For anarchist historian [[George Woodcock]] "Wilde's aim in ''The Soul of Man under Socialism'' is to seek the society most favorable to the artist...for Wilde art is the supreme end, containing within itself enlightenment and regeneration, to which all else in society must be subordinated...Wilde represents the anarchist as [[aesthete]]."&lt;ref name="Anarchism 1962. p. 447"/&gt; The word individualism in this way has been used to denote a personality with a strong tendency towards self-creation and experimentation as opposed to tradition or popular mass opinions and behaviors.&lt;ref name="thefreedictionary.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bohemia: The Underworld of Art"/&gt;

Anarchist writer [[Murray Bookchin]] describes a lot of individualist anarchists as people who "expressed their opposition in uniquely personal forms, especially in fiery tracts, outrageous behavior, and aberrant lifestyles in the cultural ghettos of fin de siècle New York, Paris, and London. As a credo, individualist anarchism remained largely a bohemian lifestyle, most conspicuous in its demands for sexual freedom ('[[free love]]') and enamored of innovations in art, behavior, and clothing."&lt;ref name="bohemian individualism"/&gt;

In relation to this view of individuality, French Individualist anarchist [[Emile Armand]] advocates [[ethical egoism|egoistical]] denial of social conventions and dogmas to live in accord to one's own ways and desires in daily life since he emphasized anarchism as a way of life and practice. In this way he opines "So the anarchist individualist tends to reproduce himself, to perpetuate his spirit in other individuals who will share his views and who will make it possible for a state of affairs to be established from which authoritarianism has been banished. It is this desire, this will, not only to live, but also to reproduce oneself, which we shall call "activity".&lt;ref name="lifeactivity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaz.org/~dan/individualist-anarchist/library/emile-armand/life-activity.html|title=Emil Armand "Anarchist Individualism as a Life and Activity"|first=|last=_wlo:dek|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Imperfect garden : the legacy of humanism'', humanist philosopher [[Tzvetan Todorov]] identifies individualism as an important current of socio-political thought within modernity and as examples of it he mentions [[Michel de Montaigne]], [[François de La Rochefoucauld (writer)|François de La Rochefoucauld]], [[Marquis de Sade]], and [[Charles Baudelaire]].&lt;ref name="Princeton University Press 2002"&gt;''Imperfect garden : the legacy of humanism''. Princeton University Press. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In La Rochefoucauld, he identifies a tendency similar to [[stoicism]] in which "the honest person works his being in the manner of a sculptor who searches the liberation of the forms which are inside a block of marble, to extract the truth of that matter."&lt;ref name="Princeton University Press 2002"/&gt; In Baudelaire he finds the [[dandy]] trait in which one searches to cultivate "the idea of beauty within oneself, of satisfying one's passions of feeling and thinking."&lt;ref name="Princeton University Press 2002"/&gt;

The [[Russian American|Russian-American]] poet [[Joseph Brodsky]] once wrote that "The surest defense against Evil is extreme individualism, originality of thinking, whimsicality, even—if you will—eccentricity. That is, something that can't be feigned, faked, imitated; something even a seasoned imposter couldn't be happy with."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quotes.dictionary.com/The_surest_defense_against_Evil_is_extreme_individualism |title=Dictionary.com - The world's favorite online dictionary! |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119120030/http://quotes.dictionary.com/The_surest_defense_against_Evil_is_extreme_individualism |archivedate=2010-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] famously declared, "Whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist"—a point of view developed at length in both the life and work of [[Henry David Thoreau]]. Equally memorable and influential on [[Walt Whitman]] is Emerson's idea that "a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines." Emerson opposes on principle the reliance on civil and religious social structures precisely because through them the individual approaches the divine second-hand, mediated by the once original experience of a genius from another age. "An institution," he explains, "is the lengthened shadow of one man." To achieve this original relation one must "Insist on one's self; never imitate" for if the relationship is secondary the connection is lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/emerson/#H2|title=Emerson, Ralph Waldo - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''extradimensional being''' or intelligence (also '''intra-dimensional'''&lt;ref name="synonyms"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coppens|first=Philip|title=The Ancient Alien Question: A New Inquiry Into the Existence, Evidence, and Influence of Ancient Visitors|date=2012|publisher=New Page Books, A Division of The Career Press, Inc|location=Pompton Plains, NJ|isbn=978-1-60163-628-7|pages=126, 268, 273, and 274 in the e-book version. The term "intra-dimensional" was suggested by George Lucas (pg. 126)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''other-dimensional'''&lt;ref name="synonyms"  /&gt;) is a type of theoretical or a real entity  in a [[dimension]] beyond our own. Such beings are common in science fiction, fantasy and supernatural fiction.

=== Implementation of dimensional portals ===
In the [[Star Trek]] universe, [[wormhole]] theory states that if a section in the fabric of spacetime joins together with another section of spacetime, a direct connection can be made between the two, allowing speedy travel between the two (normally unrelated) spacetime coordinates. [[Black hole]]s are one such way of stretching the fabric of spacetime; so it's theoretically possible to create wormholes
using a pair of [[Gravitational singularity|singularities]], at least in the fictional universe of Star Trek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yakuprising.net/pdf/BlackHolesPaper.pdf|title=Black Holes in Star Trek: Science Fact and Fiction}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[NASA]] Web site has a somewhat dated article called "The Science of Star Trek", by physicist David Allen Batchelor (5 May 2009), which considers some of the implementations in Star Trek. He says it's "the only science fiction series crafted with such respect for real science and intelligent writing", with some "imaginary science" mixed in; and considers it to be the "only science fiction series that many scientists watch regularly", like himself. He says it's "more faithful to science than any other science fiction series ever shown on television".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Batchelor|first=David|title=The Science of Star Trek|url=http://www.nasa.gov/topics/technology/features/star_trek.html|accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Universe dimensionality ===
An additional fictional work that does include universe dimensionality of some sort includes the [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]] series, according to a particular academic source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Seven Seasons of Buffy|publisher=BenBella Books|author=Glenn Yeffeth|isbn=978-1-932100-08-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In literature ===

==== The Time Machine (H. G. Wells) ====
[[The Time Machine]] by [[H. G. Wells]] describes [[time travel]]ers as interdimensionally capable.

The protagonist describes the passing of time, and also treats it as if it were a spatial dimension. This is exactly how H. G. Wells devises the time machine mechanism in this particular work of fiction. H. G. Wells supposes that if time could simply be treated as space, then time machines would indeed operate correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/35/pg35.html|title=The Time Machine by H. G. Wells – Full Text}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the H. G. Wells definition of a time traveler must be equivalent to that of an interdimensional being – an entity capable of traveling through unusual dimensional rifts that few other entities can enter.

From H. G. Wells' Work: 'Clearly,' the Time Traveller proceeded, 'any real body must have extension in four directions: it must have Length, Breadth, Thickness, and—Duration. But through a natural infirmity of the [[flesh]], which I will explain to you in a moment, we incline to overlook this fact. There are really four dimensions, three which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time. There is, however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former three [[dimensions]] and the [[latter]], because it happens that our [[consciousness]] moves intermittently in one direction along the latter from the beginning to the end of our lives.

==== The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Douglas Adams) ====
[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]] by [[Douglas Adams]] describes that [[mice]] are 'merely the protrusion into our dimension of vast hyper-intelligent pan-dimensional beings.' The old man, [[Slartibartfast]], from [[Magrathea]] told the protagonist, Arthur, that the planet he lived on, Earth, 'was commissioned, paid for, and run by mice.' and that the mice were furious when it was destroyed.

==== Flatland ====
[[Flatland]] by [[Edwin Abbott Abbott]] describes the interactions of a [[two-dimensional space|two-dimensional]] [[square]] with an interdimensional being from a coexisting [[Three-dimensional_space|three-dimensional]] [[spacetime]].

'''Isogamy''' is a form of [[sexual reproduction]] that involves [[gamete]]s of similar [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] (similar shape and size), differing in general only in [[allele]] [[Gene expression|expression]] in one or more [[mating-type region]]s. Because both gametes look alike, they cannot be classified as "[[male]]" or "[[female]]". Instead, organisms undergoing isogamy are said to have different [[mating type]]s, most commonly noted as "+" and "&amp;minus;" strains, although in some species of [[Basidiomycota]] there are more than two mating types (designated by numbers or letters). In all cases, [[fertilization]] occurs when gametes of two different mating types fuse to form a [[zygote]].

==Evolution==
It appears that isogamy was the first stage of [[sexual reproduction]]. In several lineages (plants, animals), this form of reproduction independently evolved to [[anisogamy|anisogamous]] species with [[gamete]]s of male and [[female]] types to [[oogamy|oogamous]] species in which the female gamete is very much larger than the male and has no ability to move. There is a good argument that this pattern was driven by the physical constraints on the mechanisms by which two gametes get together as required for [[sexual reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;Dusenbery, David B. (2009). ''Living at Micro Scale'', Chapter 20. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts {{ISBN|978-0-674-03116-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ascomycetes]], anisogamy (sexes) evolved from isogamy before mating types.&lt;ref&gt;Beukeboom, L. and Perrin, N. (2014). ''The Evolution of Sex Determination''. Oxford University Press, p. 10 [https://books.google.com/books?id=d4cLBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]. Online resources, [http://www.oup.co.uk/companion/beukeboom].&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=May 2017|reason=Page number appears wrong. Someone should find the right page}}

==Biological types==

===With motile cells===
There are several types of isogamy. Both gametes may be [[Flagellum|flagellated]] and thus [[Motility|motile]]. This type occurs for example in [[algae]] such as some but not all species of ''[[Chlamydomonas]]''.

===With non-motile cells===
In another type, neither of the gametes is flagellated. This is the case for example in the [[mating of yeast]]. Yeast mating types are commonly noted as "a" and "α" (alpha) instead of "+" and "-".

===Conjugation===
Another, more complex form, is conjugation (similar to the exchange of genetic material through a bridge in [[bacterial conjugation]], but involving reproduction). This occurs in some the green algae, the [[Zygnematophyceae]], e.g., ''[[Spirogyra]]''. These algae grow as filaments of cells. When two filaments of opposing mating types come close together, the cells form conjugation tubes between the filaments. Once the tubes are formed, one cell balls up and crawls through the tube into the other cell to fuse with it, forming a zygote.

In [[ciliates]], cell fission may follow self-fertilization ([[autogamy]]), or it may follow conjugation (exchange of nuclei).

In [[zygomycete]]s fungi, two [[hyphae]] of opposing mating types form special structures called [[gametangia]] where the hyphae touch. The gametangia then fuse into a [[zygospore|zygosporangium]]. In other fungi, cells from two hyphae with opposing mating types fuse, but only the cytoplasm is fused ([[plasmogamy]]). The two nuclei do not fuse, leading to the formation of a [[dikaryon]] cell that gives rise to a [[mycelium]] consisting of dikaryons. [[Karyogamy]] (fusion of nuclei) then eventually occurs in [[sporangia]], and leads to the formation of diploid cells (zygotes) that immediately undergo [[meiosis]] to form [[spore]]s.
[[File:SpirogyraConjugation100x.jpg|thumb|Spirogyra conjugation]]
In many cases, isogamous fertilization is used by organisms that can also reproduce asexually through [[binary fission]], [[budding]], or asexual [[spore formation]]. The switch to [[sexual reproduction]] mode is often triggered by a change from favorable to unfavorable growing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bernstein |first=H |last2=Bernstein |first2=C |last3=Michod |first3=RE |year=2011 |chapter=Meiosis as an Evolutionary Adaptation for DNA Repair |title=DNA Repair |editor=Inna Kruman |isbn=978-953-307-697-3 |publisher=InTech |url=http://www.intechopen.com/books/dna-repair/meiosis-as-an-evolutionary-adaptation-for-dna-repair}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fertilization often leads to the formation of a thick-walled zygotic [[resting spore]] that can withstand harsh environments and will germinate once growing conditions turn favorable again.

== Early life and education ==
Aaker was born in [[Palo Alto, California]], to Kay Aaker,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wake|first=Jennifer|title=The Gift of Time: Skilled Volunteers Found in Local Retirees|url=http://www.volunteereastbay.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/The_Gift_of_Time.pdf|work=April 15, 2009|publisher=La Morinda Weekly|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Aaker]], a professor and brand consultant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David A. Aaker, Author Profile|url=http://authors.simonandschuster.com/David-A-Aaker/1451364|publisher=Simon and Schuster|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaker attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where she studied under social psychologist [[Philip E. Tetlock]] and [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Daniel Kahneman]], receiving a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[Psychology]] in 1989. In 1990, Aaker began postgraduate work at Stanford Graduate School of Business, earning a Ph.D. in marketing with a minor in psychology in 1995. Her dissertation on brand personality led to the publication of three academic papers  in ''Journal of Marketing Research'' and ''Journal of Consumer Research'' and won several awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honors and Recognition |url=http://faculty.gsb.stanford.edu/aaker/documents/Aaker_Vita.pdf |work=2013 |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=15 June 2013 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Aaker began her academic career in 1995 as an assistant professor at the [[UCLA Anderson School of Management]].  In 1999, she returned to the Stanford Graduate School of Business as an assistant professor, was promoted to associate professor in 2001, and earned a full professorship in 2004. In 2005, Aaker was named General Atlantic Professor of Marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aaker CV at Stanford Graduate School of Business |url=http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/aaker/documents/Aaker_Vita.pdf |work=January, 2013 |publisher=Stanford University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722150424/http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/aaker/documents/Aaker_Vita.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work has been published in scholarly journals in psychology and marketing and has been highlighted in ''[[The Economist]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek|BusinessWeek]]'', ''[[Forbes]],'' [[NPR]], ''[[CBS MoneyWatch]]'', ''[[Inc. (magazine)|Inc.]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]].'' She serves as an advisory board member for several private companies.

As a social psychologist and marketer, Aaker began her research career by proposing a "Dimensions of Brand Personality" framework to describe and measure the "personality" of a brand, defined as the set of human characteristics associated with it. The five core dimensions are Sincerity, Excitement, Competence, Sophistication, and Ruggedness.  In a global analysis of brands, Aaker and her colleagues revealed two novel brand personality dimensions. In Japan, individuals viewed brands as Peaceful, and in Spain, individuals viewed brands as Passionate.  Aaker’s model showed that brand personality dimensions influence consumer preference and choice and provided a framework that illuminated how to build strong global brands that meet multi-cultural needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aaker|first=Jennifer|title=Dimensions of Brand Personality|date=August 1997|url=http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/groups/finance/Papers/Dimensions%20of%20BP%20JMR%201997.pdf|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Aaker shifted her research focus to understanding time, money and happiness. In this work, she suggested that time is a resource that, like money, is not only important but more subjective than we think. In 2010, she published two papers with [[Sepandar Kamvar|Sep Kamvar]] and Cassie Mogilner on the dynamic meaning of happiness.  Prior research had suggested that the meaning of happiness is either similar across individuals, or highly subjective and idiosyncratic.  Aaker and her colleagues show that the answer lies between the two and that there is in fact a predictable shift in the meaning of happiness and how it is experienced over one's life and even within the day or week. The research also showed that the meaning of happiness that one holds impacts the choices people make.

Aaker has also examined questions such as why people give to others, how small acts create significant change, and how those effects can be fueled by social media.

In 2010, Aaker and her husband, startup advisor Andy Smith, authored the book ''The Dragonfly Effect:  Quick, Effective and Powerful Ways to Use Social Media to Drive Social Change.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dragonfly Effect|url=http://www.dragonflyeffect.com/|work=2013|publisher=Official Website|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;    With a title inspired by the dragonfly’s unique ability to propel itself in any direction when its four wings worked in concert, the book examined the manner in which synchronized ideas can be used to create rapid transformations through social media. A literary award winner,[5] ''The Dragonfly Effect'' has been translated into over 10 languages. In 2013, Aaker, Smith and McCarthy published ''The Power of Stories'', a companion to ''The Dragonfly Effect'', which further explored social media through psychological insight and provided a hands-on tool to help companies put the model to work.

In a real world demonstration of the Dragonfly Effect, Aaker and her students founded 100K Cheeks,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=David|first=Avril|title=Names You Need to Know|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/avrildavid/2011/05/17/names-you-need-to-know-the-dragonfly-effect/|work=May 17, 2011|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Power of Stores|ISBN=1484184386}}&lt;/ref&gt;  an organization dedicated to registering 100,000 South Asian donors in the National Bone Marrow Registry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Past Challenges (Get Involved) |url=http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/haas/100kcheeks |publisher=Haas Center for Public Service |accessdate=13 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221230214/http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/haas/100kcheeks |archivedate=21 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   In addition to utilizing social networks, Aaker ran the first ever cheek swab in India; as a result of these efforts, 100K Cheeks exceeded their goal by registering more than 115,000 potential donors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jennifer Aaker: Pursuit of Happiness|url=http://www.inktalks.com/discover/53/pursuit-of-happiness|work=November 27, 2011|publisher=Ink Talks|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beth Kanter Katie Delahaye Paine|first=Katie Delahaye Paine|title=Measuring the Networked Nonprofit: Using Data to Change the World|year=2012|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=978-1-118-13760-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vL_lhYF0Uf4C&amp;pg=PT36&amp;lpg=PT36&amp;dq=jennifer+aaker+100k+cheeks}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dragonfly Effect|url=http://www.ssireview.org/articles/entry/the_dragonfly_effect|work=October 2011|publisher=Stanford Social Innovation Review|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Social media is not inherently meaningful," Aaker said in an interview on the subject.

'' ''' Les Dialogues d’Evhémère''' '' ('The Dialogues of [[Euhemerus]]') is a little-known philosophical dialogue by [[Voltaire]], published in 1777. At the time of its writing he was 83 years old and knew that he was coming to the end of his life:&lt;ref name="Vermeer"/&gt; the work is a kind of philosophical testament.  Like many other works by Voltaire, it is written in the tradition of Socratic dialogue, where the interlocutors seek the truth together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banderier |first1=Gilles |title=Voltaire en dialogues |journal=Acta fabula |date=May 2006 |volume=7 |issue=2 |url=http://www.fabula.org/acta/document1332.php |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments==
The imagined dialogue takes place between two historical figures, Euhemerus and Callicrates. Euhemerus, a [[Stoic]], was a contemporary of [[Alexander the Great]], remembered mostly for his view that the Classical Greek gods had originally been people, deified long after their deaths by their followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Meurger |first1=Michel |title=Evhémère et les monstres. Croyances populaires et interprétation instruite |url=https://www.hommes-et-faits.com/lime/MMeurger_Monsters_.htm |website=Hommes et faits.com |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Callicrates was also a philosopher, from the third century BC, of whom little is known but whom Voltaire makes an [[Epicurean]]. His views, including [[atheism]], are meant to represent the views of Voltaire's contemporaries [[Holbach]], [[La Mettrie]] and [[Diderot]].

In the dialogue as in historic reality Euhemeros had enjoyed a life of travel, much of it following Alexander; Callicrates is curious to know what his friend has learned as a result of these experiences. The conversations that follow are set out in twelve dialogues:&lt;ref name="Vermeer"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vermeer-Pardoen |first1=Hannie |title=Voltaire De dialogen van Euhemeros Het nut van de filosofie |date=2017 |publisher=Gennep B.V., Uitgeverij Van |location=Amsterdam |isbn=978-9461648594 |url=https://cbonline.boekhuis.nl/pls/cover/p_get_cover_fe?p_hash=0030284E59D1F5E446B902E37A7BB78D |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7–8}}

There are two main themes in the dialogues. The first six consider metaphysical questions such as whether we have a soul, whether God exists and, if he does, who is responsible for all the misery on earth. And the last six dialogues are about natural philosophy and the material world -  what we know about the cosmos, the earth, the creation of mountains, and the generation of new life. What all the dialogues have in common is an  appeal for modesty and restraint in argument. There is little we can undubitably know and much is hidden from us. For this reason, whatever we may believe, we should never ignore evidence or assumptions from outside the universe of our beliefs; rather than proclaiming dogmas we should engage in dialogue. At the same time, Euhemerus is unsparing in his attacks on atheists, atomists and materialists as well as on religious dogma - all of which he terms 'madness, misery and crime'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=de Baar |first1=Marinus |title=Niets dan waanzin, ellende en misdaad |url=https://www.trouw.nl/home/niets-dan-waanzin-ellende-en-misdaad~a275ddc5/ |website=trouw.nl |publisher=de Persgroep Nederland B.V. |accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dialogues offer an overview of Voltaire's life of thought. Euhemerus is effectively Voltaire's mouthpiece; he has seen the follies, delusions and misery of mankind. Much of the dialogue focuses on paradox of God's goodness and the misery on earth. Euhemerus draws hope from scientific progress that points to a future world built on rationality. Eventually Callicrates decides to embark on a journey of his own to the barbarian lands from which his friend had learned so much.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dialogues d'Evhémère - Voltaire (1779) |url=https://www.boekmeter.nl/book/38450 |website=Boekmeter.nl |accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Censorship and the first edition==
Voltaire's 94-page autographed manuscript still survives (pages 37–40 are not in his hand).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Receuil factice d'ouvrages et fragments autographes de Voltaire |url=http://w3public.ville-ge.ch/bge/volage.nsf/Attachments/ms01frameset.htm/$file/ms01.pdf |website=w3public.ville-ge.ch|publisher=Bibliothèque de Genève, Institut et Musée Voltaire |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Voltaire's surviving correspondence makes no reference to the work, its development, or the ideas it elaborates.&lt;ref name="Cairn"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Paillard |first1=Christophe |title=La correspondance de Voltaire et l’édition de ses œuvres. problème de méthodologie éditoriale |journal=Revue d'Histoire Litteraire de la France |date=2012 |volume=112 |pages=859–872 |doi=10.3917/rhlf.124.0859 |url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-d-histoire-litteraire-de-la-france-2012-4-page-859.htm |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise [[Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm|Grimm]] does not mention it. The ''[[Mémoires secrets]]'' from November 1777 did refer to the work however, and a comment from [[Jean-Louis Wagnière]] indicated that the ''Dialogues'' had been published only shortly before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oeuvres de Voltaire avec préfaces, avvertissement, notes ... par m.

Over the course of his life Voltaire had had his works condemned or banned by royal censors in France on many occasions.  He also had a number of ways of avoiding censorship - including arranging for his work to be printed outside France, and having it printed anonymously so he could deny authorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Birkenstock |first1=Jane |title=Château de Cirey, Residence of Voltaire |url=http://www.visitvoltaire.com/voltaire_bio.htm |website=www.visitvoltaire.com |publisher=Château de Cirey |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davidson2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Davidson|title=Voltaire: A Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hFU0CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT32|date=12 March 2012|publisher=Pegasus Books|isbn=978-1-68177-039-0|pages=32–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the presentation of challenging or radical ideas in the form of a dialogue was one method of bringing unconventional ideas to public attention while being less likely to have the word altered or suppressed.&lt;ref name="Collins2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Daniel Collins|title=Interpreting Modern Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=olt9BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87|date=8 March 2015|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-6788-2|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The frontispiece of the first known edition of the ''Dialogues d'Evhémère'' indicates that it was published in London by Voltaire not in 1777 as suggested by the ''Mémoires secrets'' but in 1779 (i.e. the year after Voltaire's death), but does not name a publisher.  In fact it is evident from the distinctive typography used that it was printed not in London but in [[Lausanne]], by Abraham-Louis Tarin, who worked for the publisher François Grasset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Livre Dialogues d'Evhémère / par M. de Voltaire |url=https://explore.rero.ch/fr_CH/rero/result/L/VlRMU19SRVJPUjAwNDMzMzQ5NQ== |website=explore.rero.ch |publisher=Réseau des bibliothèques de Suisse occidentale |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grasset is noted for having previously published a number of works attacking Voltaire as well as for having on several occasions clashed with him over the intended publication of Voltaire's works from unauthorised manuscript versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chatelard |first1=Marie-Claire |title=François GRASSET (1722-1789) |url=http://dictionnaire-journalistes.gazettes18e.fr/journaliste/359-francois-grasset |website=dictionnaire-journalistes.gazettes18e.fr |publisher=IHRIM UMR &amp; ISH USR |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5925">The '''Mars Gravity Biosatellite''' was a project initiated as a competition between universities in 2001 by the [[Mars Society]]. The aim was to build a spacecraft concept to study the effects of Mars-level gravity (~0.38g) on mammals. 

Presentations were given to [[Robert Zubrin]] ([[Mars Society]]), and the award for best design was given to The [[University of Washington]] (UW). The UW team continued to develop the concept until the end of the school year (June 2002), after which funding became an issue. The team from UW contacted members of the team that presented from MIT, and the two universities agreed to continue development together. Later [[University of Queensland]] – Australia (UQ) joined the team as well. The program ended in 2009.

==Program history and overview==
The Mars Gravity Biosatellite program began in 2001 as a [[Mars Society]] initiative called Translife that grew out of a discussion between [[Robert Zubrin]] and [[Elon Musk]].  It was intended to study the effects of the [[gravity of Mars]] (about one-third that of Earth) on [[mammals]], for which no data was available.  Over the next few years, the program grew both scope and vision, with staff and students from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] ([[Payload (air and space craft)|Payload]]), [[University of Washington|UW]] ([[Satellite bus|Spacecraft Bus]]) and [[University of Queensland|UQ]] ([[Atmospheric reentry|Reentry]]) collaboratively designing various parts of the mission concept.  With ongoing funding challenges, UW and UQ withdrew after several years and [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] stepped in to build on their design work.  The effort represented the most ambitious and complex student satellite project to date.

The mission concept was envisioned to carry 15 mice in low Earth orbit for five weeks. The satellite was designed to spin at approximately 32 rpm&lt;ref name="iac07"&gt;Korzun, Ashley M.; Wagner, Erika B.; et al. (2007). [http://smartech.gatech.edu/bitstream/1853/26717/1/IAC-07-A1.9.-A2.7.05.pdf Mars Gravity Biosatellite: Engineering, Science, and Education]. 58th [[International Astronautical Congress]].&lt;/ref&gt; to generate [[centrifugal force]] that they would experience as gravity on the surface of [[Mars]]. At the end of its mission, the satellite would reenter Earth's atmosphere and its cargo of mice would be retrieved. In 2007, a tentative launch date for the Mars Gravity Biosatellite had been set for 2010 or 2011, as the primary payload on a Falcon&amp;nbsp;1E or a Minotaur&amp;nbsp;IV launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida.&lt;ref name="iac07"/&gt; 

In 2005, the involved universities received a $200,000 NASA advanced projects development grant to support the development of a full payload engineering model.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.space.com/1625-nasa-grant-energizes-student-developed-mars-project.html NASA Grant Energizes Student-Developed Mars Project].  Leonard David, ''Space''. September 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the students of Mars Gravity developed a novel [[microfinancing]] platform called Your Name Into Space. This was meant to help finance the development of their spacecraft.  This initiative is designed to give individuals and corporations the opportunity to fly images of their choice into orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Your Name Into Space |url=http://www.yournameintospace.org/ |website=archive.org |accessdate=22 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221055613/http://www.yournameintospace.org/ |archivedate=February 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the program's end in 2009, the project had engaged over 600 undergraduate, graduate, and high school students in aerospace engineering, space life sciences, and program management. Over 20 conference presentations and papers were published, earning multiple student awards.&lt;ref name=closing&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mars Gravity Biosatellite Program Is Closing Down|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=31612|website=spaceref.com|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24&amp;nbsp;June 2009, a status report was released declaring the end of this program, due to lack of funding and shifting priorities at NASA.&lt;ref name=closing /&gt;

==Science==
{{further|Effect of spaceflight on the human body|Space medicine}}
[[Gravity of Mars|Gravity on Mars]] is only about 38% as strong as it is on Earth, and the long-term effects of such reduced gravity are unknown. Astronauts who are weightless for long periods of time lose significant amounts of bone and muscle mass. It is unclear if the gravity on Mars is strong enough to avoid or minimize these health problems. The Mars Gravity Biosatellite was meant to provide data on how mammalian health is affected by long-term exposure to lower levels of gravity, focusing on bone loss, changes in bone structure, [[muscle atrophy]], and changes in the [[inner ear]]. The results from the five-week mission experiment would have been compared against a variety of Earth-based controls, including vivarium, hindlimb suspension, partial weight suspension, flight habitat effects, and short-radius centrifuge testing.&lt;ref name="iac07"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2590">An '''obligation''' is a course of action that someone is required to take, whether [[legal obligation|legal]] or [[moral obligation|moral]].  There are also obligations in other normative contexts, such as obligations of [[etiquette]], [[social]] obligations, [[religious]] and possibly in terms of [[politics]], where obligations are requirements which must be fulfilled. These are generally [[legal]] obligations, which can incur a penalty for non-fulfilment, although certain people are obliged to carry out certain actions for other reasons as well, whether as a [[tradition]] or for social reasons.

Obligations vary from person to person: for example, a person holding a political office will generally have far more obligations than an average adult citizen, who themselves will have more obligations than a child.&lt;ref&gt;Old Bear, ''Sacred Journey of the Medicine Wheel'' (2008), p. 393: "Adults have more obligations and are held to higher standards of accountability than children are".&lt;/ref&gt; Obligations are generally granted in return for an increase in an individual's rights or power.  For example, obligations for health and safety in a workplace from employer to employee maybe to ensure the fire exit is not blocked or ensure that the plugs are put in firmly.

The word "obligation" can also designate a written obligation, or such things as bank notes, coins, checks, bonds, stamps, or securities.

==Other uses==
The term obligate can also be used in a biological context, in reference to species which must occupy a certain niche or behave in a certain way in order to survive. In biology, the opposite of obligate is [[facultative]], meaning that a species is able to behave in a certain way and may do so under certain circumstances, but that it can also survive without having to behave this way. For example, species of salamanders in the family [[Proteidae]] are obligate [[paedomorphs]], whereas species belonging to the [[Ambystomatidae]] are facultative paedomorphs.

In the Catholic Church, [[Holy Days of Obligation]] or Holidays of Obligation, less commonly called Feasts of Precept, are the days on which, as canon 1247 of the [[Code of Canon Law]] states, the faithful are obliged to participate in the [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]].

== Approach ==

The project uses a [[supertree]] approach to generate a single phylogenetic tree (served at tree.opentreeoflife.org&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/|title=opentree|first=Open Tree of Life developers|last=&lt;mtholder@gmail.com&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) from a comprehensive [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] and a curated set of published phylogenetic estimates.

The taxonomy is a combination of several large classifications produced by other projects; it is created using a software tool called "smasher"
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rees JA, Cranston K | title = Automated assembly of a reference taxonomy for phylogenetic data synthesis | journal = Biodiversity Data Journal | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = e12581 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28765728 | pmc = 5515096 | doi = 10.3897/BDJ.5.e12581 | url = https://bdj.pensoft.net/articles.php?id=12581 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting taxonomy is called an Open Tree Taxonomy (OTT) and can be browsed on-line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/taxonomy/browse | title = tree.opentreeoflife.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The project was started in June 2012 with a three-year [[National Science Foundation|NSF]] award to researchers at ten universities. In 2015, a two-year supplemental award was made to researchers at three institutions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17263">'''Parent–offspring conflict''' ('''POC''') is an expression coined in 1974 by [[Robert Trivers]]. It is used to describe the [[evolutionary conflict]] arising from differences in optimal [[parental investment]] (PI) in an offspring from the standpoint of the [[parent]] and the [[offspring]]. PI is any investment by the parent in an individual offspring that decreases the parent's ability to invest in other offspring, while the selected offspring's chance of surviving increases.

POC occurs in sexually reproducing species and is based on a genetic conflict: Parents are equally related to each of their offspring and are therefore expected to equalize their investment among them. Offspring are only half or less related to their [[sibling]]s (and fully related to themselves), so they try to get more PI than the parents intended to provide even at their siblings' disadvantage. 
However, POC is limited by the close genetic relationship between parent and offspring: If an offspring obtains additional PI at the expense of its siblings, it decreases the number of its surviving siblings. Therefore, any [[gene]] in an offspring that leads to additional PI decreases (to some extent) the number of surviving copies of itself that may be located in siblings. Thus, if the costs in siblings are too high, such a gene might be selected against despite the benefit to the offspring. 
The problem of specifying how an individual is expected to weigh a relative against itself has been examined by [[W. D. Hamilton]] in 1964 in the context of [[kin selection]]. [[Kin selection#Hamilton's rule|Hamilton's rule]] says that [[altruistic behavior]] will be positively selected if the benefit to the recipient multiplied by the genetic relatedness of the recipient to the performer is greater than the cost to the performer of a social act. Conversely, selfish behavior can only be favoured when Hamilton's inequality is not satisfied. This leads to the prediction that, other things being equal, POC will be stronger under half siblings (e.g., unrelated males father a female's successive offspring) than under full siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trivers | first1 = R.L. | authorlink = Robert Trivers | year = 1974 | title = Parent-offspring conflict | url = | journal = Am. Zool. | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 249–264 | doi=10.1093/icb/14.1.249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schlomer|first=G.L.|author2=Ellis, B.J. |author3=Garber, J. |title=Mother–Child Conflict and Sibling Relatedness: A Test of Hypotheses From Parent–Offspring Conflict Theory|journal=Journal of Research on Adolescence|year=2010|volume=20|pages=287–306|doi=10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00641.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==

===In plants===
In [[plants]], POC over the allocation of resources to the brood members may affect both brood size (number of [[seed]]s matured within a single fruit) and seed size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sadras | first1 = V.O. | last2 = Denison | first2 = R.F. | year = 2009 | title = Do plant parts compete for resources? An evolutionary perspective | url = | journal = New Phytol | volume = 183 | issue = 3| pages = 565–574 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.02848.x | pmid = 19413690 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning brood size, the most economic use of maternal resources is achieved by packing as many seeds as possible in one fruit, i.e., minimizing the cost of packing per seed. In contrast, offspring benefeits from low numbers of seeds per fruit, which reduces sibling competition before and after dispersal. Conflict over seed size arises because there usually exists an inverse exponential relationship between seed size and [[fitness (biology)|fitness]], that is, the fitness of a seed increases at a diminishing rate with resource investment but the fitness of the maternal parent has an optimum, as demonstrated by Smith and Fretwell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = C.C. | last2 = Fretwell | first2 = S.D. | year = 1974 | title = The optimal balance between size and number of offspring | url = | journal = Am. Nat. | volume = 108 | issue = 962| pages = 499–506 | doi = 10.1086/282929 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[marginal value theorem]]). However, the optimum resource investment from the offspring's point of view would be the maximum that it can possibly get from the maternal parent.

This conflict about resource allocation is most obviously manifested in the reduction of brood size (i.e. a decrease in the proportion of [[ovule]]s matured into seeds). Such reduction can be assumed to be caused by the offspring: If the maternal parent's interest were to produce as few seeds as observed, [[Selection (biology)|selection]] would not favour the production of extra ovules that do not mature into seeds. (Although other explanations for this phenomenon exist, such as [[genetic load]], resource depletion or maternal regulation of offspring quality, they could not be supported by experiments.)

There are several possibilities how the offspring can affect paternal resource allocation to brood members. Evidence exists for [[siblicide]] by dominant embryos: Embryos formed early kill the remaining embryos through an aborting chemical. In oaks, early fertilized ovules prevent the [[fertilization]] of other ovules by inhibiting the [[pollen tube]] entry into the [[embryo sac]]. In some species, the maternal parent has evolved postfertilization [[abortion]] of few seeded pods. Nevertheless, cheating by the offspring is also possible here, namely by late siblicide, when the postfertilization abortion has ceased.

According to the general POC model, reduction of brood size – if caused by POC – should depend on genetic relatedness between offspring in a fruit. Indeed, abortion of embryos is more common in [[out-crossing]] than in [[self-pollinating]] plants (seeds in cross-pollinating plants are less related than in self-pollinating plants). Moreover, the level of solicitation of resources by the offspring is also increased in cross-pollinating plants: There are several reports that the average weight of crossed seeds is greater than of seeds produced by self-fertilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Uma Shaanker | first1 = R. | last2 = Ganeshaiah | first2 = K.N. | last3 = Bawa | first3 = K.S. | year = 1988 | title = Parent-offspring conflict, sibling rivalry, and brood size patterns in plants | url = | journal = Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst. | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 177–205 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.es.19.110188.001141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In birds===
Some of the earliest examples of parent-offspring conflict were seen in [[bird]] broods and especially in [[raptor birds|raptor]] species. While parent birds often lay two eggs and attempt to raise two or more young, the strongest fledgling takes a greater share of the food brought by parents and will often kill the weaker sibling ([[siblicide]]). Such conflicts have been suggested as a driving force in the evolution of optimal [[clutch size]] in birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mock | first1 = D.W. | last2 = Drummond | first2 = H. | last3 = Stinson | first3 = C.H. | year = 1990 | title = Avian siblicide | url = | journal = Am. Sci. | volume = 78 | issue = | pages = 438–449 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[blue-footed booby]], parent-offspring conflict results in times of food scarcity. When there is less food available in a given year, the older, dominant chick will often kill the younger chick by either attacking directly, or by driving it from the nest. Parents try to prevent siblicide by building nests with steeper sides &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=David J.|title=The Role of Parents in Siblicidal Brood Reduction of Two Booby Species|journal=The Auk|year=1995|volume=112|issue=4|pages=860–869|doi=10.2307/4089018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by laying heavier second eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=D'Alba|first=Liliana |author2=Roxana Torres |author3=G.R. Bortolotti|title=Seasonal Egg-Mass Variation and Laying Sequence in a Bird with Facultative Brood Reductions|journal=The Auk|year=2007|volume=124|issue=2|pages=643–652|doi=10.1642/0004-8038(2007)124[643:sevals]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In mammals===
Even before POC theory arose, debates took place over whether [[infant]]s [[wean]] themselves or mothers actively wean their infants. Furthermore, it was discussed whether maternal rejections increase infant independence. It turned out that both mother and infant contribute to infant independence. Maternal rejections can be followed by a short-term increase in infant contact but they eventually result in a long-term decrease of contact as has been shown for several primates: In wild [[baboon]]s infants that are rejected early and frequently spend less time in contact whereas those that are not rejected stay much longer in the proximity of their mother and suckle or ride even in advanced ages. In wild [[chimpanzee]]s an abrupt increase in maternal rejections and a decrease in mother-offspring contact is found when mothers resume [[Estrus#Estrus|estrus]] and consort with males. In [[rhesus macaque]]s a high probability of conception in the following mating season is associated with a high rate of maternal rejection. Rejection and behavioral conflicts can occur during the first months of an infant's life and when the mother resumes estrus. These findings suggest that the [[reproduction]] of the mother is influenced by the interaction with their offspring. So there is a potential for conflicts over PI.
It was also observed in rhesus macaques that the number of contacts made by offspring is significantly higher than the number of contacts made by mother during a mating season, whereas the opposite holds for the number of broken contacts. This fact suggests that the mother resists offspring's demands for contact, whereas offspring is apparently more interested in spending time in contact. At three months of infant age a shift from mother to infant in responsibility for maintaining contact takes place. So when the infant becomes more independent, its effort to maintain proximity to its mother increases. This might sound paradoxical but becomes clear when one takes into account that POC increases during the period of PI. In summary, all these findings are consistent with POC-theory.

One might object that time in contact is not a reasonable measure for PI and that, for example, time for milk transfer ([[lactation]]) would be a better one. Here one can argue that mother and infant have different [[thermoregulation|thermoregulatory]] needs due to the fact that they have different surface-to-volume ratios resulting in more rapid loss of heat in infants compared to adults. So infants may be more sensitive to low temperatures than their mothers. An infant might try to compensate by increased contact time with their mother, which could initiate a behavioral conflict over time. Consistency of this hypothesis has been shown for [[Japanese macaque]]s where decreasing temperatures result in higher maternal rejections and increased number of contacts made by infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maestripieri | first1 = D | year = 2002 | title = Parent-offspring conflict in primates | url = | journal = International Journal of Primatology | volume = 23 | issue = 4| pages = 923–951 | doi=10.1023/a:1015537201184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In social insects===

In eusocial species, the parent-offspring conflict takes on a unique role because of [[haplodiploidy]] and the prevalence of sterile workers. Sisters are more related to each other (0.75) than to their mothers (0.5) or brothers (0.25). In most cases, this drives female workers to try and obtain a sex ratio of 3:1 (females to males) in the colony. However, queens are equally related to both sons and daughters, so they prefer a sex ratio of 1:1. The conflict in social insects is about the level investment the queen should provide for each sex for current and future offspring. It is generally thought that workers will win this conflict and the sex ratio will be closer to 3:1, however there are examples, like in ''[[Bombus terrestris]]'', where the queen has considerable control in forcing a 1:1 ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bourke, A.F.G. and F.L.W. Ratnieks | year = 2001 | title = Kin-selected conflict in the bumble-bee ''Bombus terrestris'' (Hymenoptera: Apidae) | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B | volume = 268 | pages = 347–355 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1381 | pmid=11270430 | pmc=1088613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In humans===
An important illustration of such conflict is provided by David Haig’s (1993) work on genetic conflicts in pregnancy. Haig has argued that [[fetus|fetal]] genes would be selected to draw more resources from the mother than it would be optimal for the mother to give, a hypothesis that has received empirical support. The [[placenta]], for example, secretes allocrine [[hormone]]s that decrease the sensitivity of the mother to [[insulin]] and thus make a larger supply of blood sugar available to the fetus. The mother responds by increasing the level of insulin in her bloodstream, and to counteract this effect the placenta has insulin receptors that stimulate the production of insulin-degrading [[enzyme]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haig | first1 = D. | authorlink = David Haig (biologist) | year = 1993 | title = Genetic conflicts in human pregnancy | url = | journal = Quart. Rev. Biol. | volume = 68 | issue = 4| pages = 495–532 | doi = 10.1086/418300 | pmid = 8115596 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 30 percent of human [[fertilisation|conceptions]] do not progress to full term (22 percent before becoming clinical pregnancies)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 3393170 | doi=10.1056/NEJM198807283190401 | volume=319 | title=Incidence of early loss of pregnancy | journal=N Engl J Med | pages=189–94 | last1 = Wilcox | first1 = AJ | last2 = Weinberg | first2 = CR | last3 = O'Connor | first3 = JF | last4 = Baird | first4 = DD | last5 = Schlatterer | first5 = JP | last6 = Canfield | first6 = RE | last7 = Armstrong | first7 = EG | last8 = Nisula | first8 = BC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this creates a second arena for conflict between the mother and the fetus, because the fetus will have a lower quality cut off point for [[spontaneous abortion]] than the mother. The mother's quality cut-off point should also decline as she nears the end of her reproductive life and it may be significant that the offspring of older mothers have a higher incidence of genetic defects. Initially, the maintenance of pregnancy is controlled by the maternal hormone [[progesterone]], but in later stages it is controlled by the fetal [[human chorionic gonadotrophin]] released into the maternal bloodstream, which causes the release of maternal progesterone. There is also conflict over blood supply to the placenta, with the fetus being prepared to demand a larger blood supply than is optimal for the mother (or even for itself, since high birth weight is a risk factor). This results in [[hypertension]] and, significantly, high [[birth weight]] is positively correlated with maternal blood pressure.

After birth the young infant may demand more nutritional resources than the lactating mother is prepared to provide, and the presence of [[benzodiazepine]]-like compounds in [[breast milk]] may function to keep this in check, although its primary function is to calm the infant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dencker |first1=SJ |title=Quantification of naturally occurring benzodiazepine-like substances in human breast milk. |journal=Psychopharmacology |date=1992 |volume=107 |issue=1 |pages=69–72 |pmid=1589563 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During pregnancy, there is a two-way traffic of immunologically active cell lines through the placenta. Fetal [[lymphocyte]] lines may survive in women even decades after giving birth. These cells may serve the adaptive interest of the mother, however, they may also serve conflicting interests of the fetus or those of the father. This mixture of shared or contradicting interests has been hypothesized as giving rise to diseases like autoimmune diseases, infertility, and habitual abortion in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Apari P, Rózsa L| title=The tripartite immune conflict in placentals and a hypothesis on fetal→maternal Microchimerism| format=pdf| journal=Medical Hypotheses| year=2009| volume=72|pages= 52–54|pmid= 18930355|issue= 1|doi= 10.1016/j.mehy.2008.08.021| url=http://www.zoologia.hu/list/microchimerism.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53895">'''Pessimism''' is a mental attitude in which an undesirable outcome is anticipated from a given situation. Pessimists tend to focus on the negatives of life in general. A common question asked to test for pessimism is "[[Is the glass half empty or half full?]]"; in this situation a pessimist is said to see the glass as half empty, while an [[optimism|optimist]] is said to see the glass as half full. Throughout history, the pessimistic disposition has had effects on all major areas of thinking.&lt;ref name="ben"&gt;Bennett, Oliver. ''Cultural pessimism.'' Edinburgh university press.  2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philosophical pessimism''' is the related idea that views the world in a strictly anti-optimistic fashion. This form of pessimism is not an emotional disposition as the term commonly connotes. Instead, it is a philosophy or worldview that directly challenges the notion of progress and what may be considered the faith-based claims of optimism. Philosophical pessimists are often [[existential nihilism|existential nihilists]] believing that life has no intrinsic meaning or value. Their responses to this condition, however, are widely varied and often life-affirming.

==Etymology==
The term pessimism derives from the Latin word ''pessimus'' meaning 'the worst'. It was first used by [[Jesuit]] critics of Voltaire's 1759 novel '[[Candide, ou l'Optimisme]]'. Voltaire was satirizing the philosophy of [[Leibniz]] who maintained that this was the 'best (optimum) of all possible worlds'. In their attacks on Voltaire, the Jesuits of the ''Revue de Trévoux'' accused him of ''pessimisme''.&lt;ref name="Dienstag"&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Dienstag |first=Joshua Foa |title=Pessimism: Philosophy, Ethic, Spirit |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=February 17, 2009 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical pessimism==&lt;!-- "Philosophical pessimism" redirects here --&gt;
[[File:DOI Rousseau.jpg|thumb|250px|Rousseau's ''[[Discourse on Inequality]]'' was an attack on the enlightenment idea of social progress which he saw as morally decadent.]]
Philosophical pessimism is not a state of mind or a psychological disposition, but rather it is a [[worldview]] or [[ethic]] that seeks to face up to the distasteful realities of the world and eliminate irrational hopes and expectations (such as the [[Idea of Progress]] and [[religious faith]]) which may lead to undesirable outcomes. Ideas which prefigure philosophical pessimism can be seen in ancient texts such as the [[Dialogue of Pessimism]] and [[Ecclesiastes]] (which maintains that everything is ''hevel'', literally 'vapor' or 'breath', but could also mean '[[senseless]]' and '[[absurdity|absurd]]'.)

In [[Western philosophy]], philosophical pessimism is not a single coherent movement, but rather a loosely associated group of thinkers with similar ideas and a family resemblance to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Pessimism: Philosophy, Ethic, Spirit'', Joshua Foa Dienstag outlines the main propositions shared by most philosophical pessimists as "that time is a burden; that the course of history is in some sense [[irony|ironic]]; that [[free will|freedom]] and [[happiness]] are incompatible; and that human existence is absurd."&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophical pessimists see the [[self-consciousness]] of man as bound up with his consciousness of time and that this leads to greater suffering than mere physical pain. While many organisms live in the present, humans and certain species of animals can contemplate the past and future, and this is an important difference. Human beings have foreknowledge of their own eventual fate and this "terror" is present in every moment of our lives as a reminder of the impermanent nature of life and of our inability to control this change.&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophical pessimistic view of the effect of historical progress tends to be more negative than positive. The philosophical pessimist does not deny that certain areas like science can "progress" but they deny that this has resulted in an overall improvement of the human condition. In this sense it could be said that the pessimist views history as ironic; while seemingly getting better, it is mostly in fact not improving at all, or getting worse.&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; This is most clearly seen in Rousseau's critique of enlightenment civil society and his preference for man in the primitive and natural state. For Rousseau, "our souls have become corrupted to the extent that our sciences and our arts have advanced towards perfection".&lt;ref&gt;Jean Jacques Rousseau, ''Discourse on the Sciences and the Arts''&lt;/ref&gt;

The pessimistic view of the human condition is that it is in a sense "absurd". [[Absurdism|Absurdity]] is seen as an ontological mismatch between our desire for meaning and fulfillment and our inability to find or sustain those things in the world, or as Camus puts it: "a divorce between man and his life, the actor and his setting".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Camus, Albert, ''The Myth of Sisyphus''&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that rational thought would lead to human flourishing can be traced to [[Socrates]] and is at the root of most forms of western optimistic philosophies. Pessimism turns the idea on its head, it faults the human freedom to reason as the feature that misaligned humanity from our world and sees it as the root of human unhappiness.&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 33-34&lt;/ref&gt;

The responses to this predicament of the human condition by pessimists are varied. Some philosophers, such as [[Schopenhauer]] and [[Mainländer]], recommend a form of resignation and self-denial (which they saw exemplified in [[Indian religions]] and [[Christian monasticism]]). Some followers tend to believe that "expecting the worst leads to the best." [[Rene Descartes]] even believed that life was better if emotional reactions to "negative" events were removed.  [[Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann]] asserted that with cultural and technological progress, the world and it's inhabitants will reach a state in which they will voluntarily embrace [[nothingness]]. Others like [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Giacomo Leopardi|Leopardi]], [[Julius Bahnsen]] and [[Albert Camus|Camus]] respond with a more life-affirming view, what Nietzsche called a "Dionysian pessimism", an embrace of life as it is in all of its constant change and suffering, without appeal to progress or hedonistic calculus. Albert Camus indicated that the common responses to the absurdity of life are often: [[Suicide]], a [[leap of faith]] (as per [[Kierkegaard]]'s [[knight of faith]]), or recognition/rebellion. Camus rejected all but the last option as unacceptable and inauthentic responses.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Philosophical pessimism has often been tied to the arts and literature. Schopenhauer's philosophy was very popular with composers ([[Wagner]], [[Brahms]] and [[Mahler]]).&lt;ref name="Wicks"&gt;{{citation|chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schopenhauer/|title= Wicks, Robert "Arthur Schopenhauer"|chapter= Arthur Schopenhauer|publisher= Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|year= 2017}}, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; Several philosophical pessimists also wrote novels or poetry (Camus and Leopardi respectively). A distinctive literary form which has been associated with pessimism is [[aphorism|aphoristic writing]], and this can be seen in Leopardi, Nietzsche and Cioran. Writers which could be said to express pessimistic views in their works or to be influenced by pessimistic philosophers include [[Miguel de Cervantes]], [[Lord Byron]], [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Gottfried Benn]], [[Sadegh Hedayat]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Joseph Conrad]], [[Charles Bukowski]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]], [[Mihai Eminescu]], [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]], [[Cormac McCarthy]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Dino Buzzati]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[H. P. Lovecraft]], [[Michel Houellebecq]], [[Thomas Ligotti]], [[Thomas Bernhard]] and [[Camilo Pessanha]].

==Notable proponents==

===Ancient Greeks===
In ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]'', Friedrich Nietzsche argued that the [[pre-Socratic]] philosophers such as [[Anaximander]], [[Heraclitus]] (called "the Weeping Philosopher") and [[Parmenides]] represented a classical form of pessimism. Nietzsche saw Anaximander's philosophy as the "enigmatic proclamation of a true pessimist". Similarly, of Heraclitus' philosophy of flux and strife he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Heraclitus]] denied the duality of totally diverse worlds—a position which Anaximander had been compelled to assume. He no longer distinguished a physical world from a metaphysical one, a realm of definite qualities from an undefinable "indefinite." And after this first step, nothing could hold him back from a second, far bolder negation: he altogether denied being. For this one world which he retained [...] nowhere shows a tarrying, an indestructibility, a bulwark in the stream. Louder than Anaximander, Heraclitus proclaimed: "I see nothing other than becoming. Be not deceived. It is the fault of your short-sightedness, not of the essence of things, if you believe you see land somewhere in the ocean of becoming and passing-away. You use names for things as though they rigidly, persistently endured; yet even the stream into which you step a second time is not the one you stepped into before." ''The Birth of Tragedy. 5, pp. 51–52'' 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another Greek expressed a form of pessimism in his philosophy: the ancient [[Cyrenaic]] philosopher [[Hegesias of Cyrene|Hegesias]] (290 BCE). Like later pessimists, Hegesias argued that lasting happiness is impossible to achieve and that all we can do is to try to avoid pain as much as possible.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Complete happiness cannot possibly exist; for that the body is full of many sensations, and that the mind sympathizes with the body, and is troubled when that is troubled, and also that fortune prevents many things which we cherished in anticipation; so that for all these reasons, perfect happiness eludes our grasp.&lt;ref name="diogquote"&gt;{{cite LotEP|chapter=Hegesias}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Hegesias of Cyrene|Hegesias]] held that all external objects, events and actions are indifferent to the wise man, even death: "for the foolish person it is expedient to live, but to the wise person it is a matter of indifference".&lt;ref name="diogquote"/&gt; According to Cicero, Hegesias wrote a book called ''Death by Starvation'', which supposedly persuaded many people that death was more desirable than life. Because of this, [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] banned Hegesias from teaching in Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''[[Tusculanae Quaestiones]]'' i. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 3rd century BCE, [[Stoicism]] propounded as an exercise "the premeditation of evils"—concentration on worst possible outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last=Burkeman |first=Oliver |authorlink=Oliver Burkeman |title=The Antidote: Happiness for people who can't stand positive thinking |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=92fgjq7-qLwC |accessdate=2013-01-22 |year=2012 |publisher=Text Publishing |isbn=9781921922671 |pages=32–33 |quote=[...] the Stoics propose a[n] elegant, sustainable and calming way to deal with the possibility of things going wrong: rather than struggling to avoid all thought of these worst-case scenarios, they counsel actively dwelling on them, staring them in the face. Which brings us to an important milestone on the negative path to happiness — a psychological tactic that William [B.] Irvine argues is 'the single most valuable technique in the Stoics' toolkit'. He calls it 'negative visualisation'. The Stoics themselves, rather more pungently, called it 'the premeditation of evils'. }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baltasar Gracián===
[[Baltasar Gracián]] (1601–1658) was Schopenhauer's favorite author and Gracián's novel ''El Criticón'' was his favorite book{{citation needed|reason=This is a very definite claim|date=January 2015}}. Schopenhauer's pessimistic outlook was influenced by Gracián, and he translated Gracián's ''The Pocket Oracle and Art of Prudence'' into German. He praised Gracián for his aphoristic writing style ([[conceptismo]]) and often quoted him in his works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=History dictionary of Schopenhauer's philosophy |last=Cartwright |first=David E. |publisher=Scarecrow press, Inc. |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gracian's novel ''El Criticón'' (The Critic) is an extended allegory of the human search for [[happiness]] which turns out to be fruitless on this Earth. ''The Critic'' paints a bleak and desolate picture of the human condition. His ''Pocket Oracle'' was a book of [[aphorisms]] on how to live in what he saw as a world filled with deception, duplicity and disillusionment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pocket Oracle and Art of Prudence |last=Gracian |first=Balthasar |publisher=Penguin books |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voltaire===
Voltaire was the first European to be labeled as a pessimist{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} due to his critique of [[Alexander Pope]]'s optimistic "An Essay on Man", and [[Leibniz]]' affirmation that "we live in the best of all possible worlds." Voltaire's novel [[Candide]] is an extended criticism of theistic optimism and his [[Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne|Poem on the Lisbon Disaster]] is especially pessimistic about the state of mankind and the nature of God. Though himself a [[Deist]], Voltaire argued against the existence of a compassionate personal God through his interpretation of the [[problem of evil]].

===Jean-Jacques Rousseau===
The major themes of philosophical pessimism were first presented by Rousseau and he has been called "the patriarch of pessimism".&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; For Rousseau, humans in their "natural goodness" have no sense of self-consciousness in time and thus are happier than humans corrupted by society. Rousseau saw the movement out of the [[state of nature]] as the origin of inequality and mankind's lack of freedom. The wholesome qualities of man in his natural state, a non-destructive love of self and compassion are gradually replaced by ''amour propre'', a self-love driven by pride and jealousy of his fellow man. Because of this, modern man lives "always outside himself", concerned with other men, the future and external objects. Rousseau also blames the human faculty of "perfectibility" and human language for tearing us away from our natural state by allowing us to imagine a future in which we are different than what we are now and therefore making us appear inadequate to ourselves (and thus 'perfectible').&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Rousseau saw the evolution of modern society as the replacement of natural egalitarianism by alienation and class distinction enforced by institutions of power. Thus ''[[The Social Contract]]'' opens with the famous phrase "Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains." Even the ruling classes are not free, in fact for Rousseau they are "greater slaves" because they require more esteem from others to rule and must therefore constantly live "outside themselves".

===Giacomo Leopardi===
Though a lesser known figure outside Italy, [[Giacomo Leopardi]] was highly influential in the 19th century, especially for Schopenhauer and Nietzsche.&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; In Leopardi's darkly comic essays, aphorisms, fables and parables, life is often described as a sort of divine joke or mistake. According to Leopardi, because of our conscious sense of time and our endless search for truth, the human desire for happiness can never be truly satiated and joy cannot last. Leopardi claims that "Therefore they greatly deceive themselves, [those] who declare and preach that the perfection of man consists in knowledge of the truth and that all his woes proceed from false opinions and ignorance, and that the human race will at last be happy, when all or most people come to know the truth, and solely on the grounds of that arrange and govern their lives."&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Leopardi believes that for man it is not possible to forget truth and that "it is easier to rid oneself of any habit before that of philosophizing."

Leopardi's response to this condition is to face up to these realities and try to live a vibrant and great life, to be risky and take up uncertain tasks. This uncertainty makes life valuable and exciting but does not free us from suffering, it is rather an abandonment of the futile pursuit of happiness. He uses the example of [[Christopher Columbus]] who went on a dangerous and uncertain voyage and because of this grew to appreciate life more fully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dialogue between Columbus and Pedro Gutierrez (Operette morali) |last=Leopardi |first=Giacomo}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Leopardi also sees the capacity of humans to laugh at their condition as a laudable quality that is able to help us deal with our predicament. For Leopardi: "He who has the courage to laugh is master of the world, much like him who is prepared to die."

===Arthur Schopenhauer===
[[File:Frankfurt Am Main-Portraits-Arthur Schopenhauer-1845.jpg|thumb|upright|Schopenhauer had an influence upon later thinkers and artists such as Freud and Wagner]]
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s pessimism comes from his elevating of [[Arthur Schopenhauer#Philosophy of the .22Will.22|Will]] above [[reason]] as the mainspring of human thought and behavior. The [[Arthur Schopenhauer#Philosophy of the .22Will.22|Will]] is the ultimate metaphysical animating [[noumenon]] and it is futile, illogical and directionless striving. Schopenhauer sees reason as weak and insignificant compared to Will; in one [[metaphor]], Schopenhauer compares the human intellect to a lame man who can see, but who rides on the shoulder of the blind giant of Will.&lt;ref name="Arthur"&gt;{{cite book |title=Studies in Pessimism |last=Schopenhauer |first=Arthur |publisher=Cosimo, Inc. |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-60206-349-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer saw human desires as impossible to satisfy. 
He pointed to motivators such as hunger, thirst and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] as the fundamental features of the Will in action, which are always by nature unsatisfactory.

&lt;blockquote&gt;All satisfaction, or what is commonly called happiness, is really and essentially always negative only, and never positive. It is not a gratification which comes to us originally and of itself, but it must always be the satisfaction of a wish. For desire, that is to say, want [or will], is the precedent condition of every pleasure; but with the satisfaction, the desire and therefore the pleasure cease; and so the satisfaction or gratification can never be more than deliverance from a pain, from a want. — ''The world as will and representation, pg 319'' &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schopenhauer notes that once satiated, the feeling of satisfaction rarely lasts and we spend most of our lives in a state of endless striving, in this sense, we are, deep down nothing but Will. Even the moments of satisfaction, when repeated often enough, only lead to boredom and thus human existence is constantly swinging "like a pendulum to and fro between pain and boredom, and these two are in fact its ultimate constituents".&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur, ''The world as will and representation'', pg 312&lt;/ref&gt; This ironic cycle eventually allows us to see the inherent vanity at the truth of existence (''nichtigkeit'') and to realize that "the purpose of our existence is not to be happy".&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur, ''The world as will and representation'', vol II, pg 635&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the business of biological life is a war of all against all filled with constant physical pain and distress, not merely unsatisfied desires. There is also the constant dread of death on the horizon to consider, which makes human life worse than animals. Reason only compounds our suffering by allowing us to realize that biology's agenda is not something we would have chosen had we been given a choice, but it is ultimately helpless to prevent us from serving it.&lt;ref name="Arthur" /&gt;

Schopenhauer saw in artistic contemplation a temporary escape from the act of willing. He believed that through "losing yourself" in art one could sublimate the Will. However, he believed that only a resignation from the pointless striving of the will to life through a form of [[asceticism]] (as those practiced by eastern monastics and by "saintly persons") could free oneself from the Will altogether.

Schopenhauer never used the term ''pessimism'' to describe his philosophy but he also didn't object when others called it that.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, David E. (2010). Schopenhauer: a Biography. Cambridge University Press. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  Other common terms used to describe his thought were [[Voluntarism (philosophy)|voluntarism]] and [[irrationalism]] which he also never used.

=== Post-Schopenhauerian pessimism&lt;!--'Post-Schopenhauerian pessimism' and 'Transcendental realism (Schopenhauer)' redirect here--&gt; ===
{{also|History of metaphysical realism}}
During the endtimes of Schopenhauer's life and subsequent years after his death, '''post-Schopenhauerian pessimism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; became a rather popular "trend" in 19th century Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Monika Langer, ''Nietzsche's Gay Science: Dancing Coherence'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2010, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it was viewed with disdain by the other popular philosophies at the time, such as [[Hegelianism]], [[materialism]], [[Neo-Kantianism]] and the emerging [[positivism]]. In an age of upcoming revolutions and exciting new discoveries in [[science]], the resigned and a-progressive nature of the typical pessimist was seen as detriment to social development. To respond to this growing criticism, a group of philosophers greatly influenced by Schopenhauer (indeed, some even being his personal acquaintances) developed their own brand of pessimism, each in their own unique way. Thinkers such as [[Julius Bahnsen]], [[Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann]], [[Philipp Mainländer]] and others cultivated the ever-increasing threat of pessimism by converting Schopenhauer's [[transcendental idealism]] into what [[Frederick C. Beiser]] calls '''transcendental realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser|Beiser]] reviews the commonly held position that Schopenhauer was a transcendental idealist and he rejects it: "Though it is deeply heretical from the standpoint of transcendental idealism, Schopenhauer's objective standpoint involves a form of ''transcendental realism'', i.e. the assumption of the independent reality of the world of experience." (Beiser, Frederick C., ''Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 40).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser|Beiser, Frederick C.]], ''Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 213 n. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The transcendental idealist thesis is that we know only the appearances of things (not [[things-in-themselves]]), the transcendental realist thesis is that "the knowledge we have of how things appear to us in experience gives us knowledge of things-in-themselves."&lt;ref name=Beiser147&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser|Beiser, Frederick C.]], ''Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016, pp. 147–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

By espousing transcendental realism, Schopenhauer's own dark observations about the nature of the world would become completely knowable and objective, and in this way they would attain certainty. The certainty of pessimism being, that non-existence is preferable to existence. That, along with the metaphysical reality of the will, were the premises which the "Post-Schopenhauerian" thinkers inherited from the [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Frankfurt sage]]'s teachings. After this common starting point, each philosopher developed his own negative view of being in their respective philosophies. Some pessimists would "assuage" the critics by accepting the validity of their criticisms and embracing [[historicism]], as was the case with Schopenhauer's literary executor [[Julius Frauenstadt]] and with [[Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann]] (who gave transcendental realism a unique twist).&lt;ref name=Beiser147/&gt; [[Julius Bahnsen]] would reshape the understanding of pessimism overall,&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser|Beiser, Frederick C.]], ''Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Philipp Mainländer]] set out to reinterpret and elucidate the nature of the will, by presenting it as a self-mortifying will-to-death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser|Beiser, Frederick C.]], ''Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Friedrich Nietzsche===
Friedrich Nietzsche could be said to be a philosophical pessimist even though unlike Schopenhauer (whom he read avidly) his response to the 'tragic' pessimistic view is neither resigned nor self-denying, but a life-affirming form of pessimism. For Nietzsche this was a "pessimism of the future", a "[[Dionysian]] pessimism."&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich, ''Die fröhliche Wissenschaft'', book V&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche identified his Dionysian pessimism with what he saw as the pessimism of the Greek [[pre-socratic]]s and also saw it at the core of ancient [[Greek tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; He saw tragedy as laying bare the terrible nature of human existence, bound by constant flux. In contrast to this Nietzsche saw [[Socrates|Socratic]] philosophy as an optimistic refuge of those who could not bear the tragic any longer. Since Socrates posited that wisdom could lead to happiness, Nietzsche saw this as "morally speaking, a sort of cowardice...amorally, a ruse".&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche was also critical of Schopenhauer's pessimism because in judging the world negatively, it turned to moral judgements about the world and therefore led to weakness and [[nihilism]]. Nietzsche's response was a total embracing of the nature of the world, a "great liberation" through a "pessimism of strength" which "does not sit in judgement of this condition".&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche believed that the task of the philosopher was to wield this pessimism like a hammer, to first attack the basis of old moralities and beliefs and then to "make oneself a new pair of wings", i.e. to [[Transvaluation of values|re-evaluate all values]] and create new ones.&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; A key feature of this Dionysian pessimism was 'saying yes' to the changing nature of the world, this entailed embracing destruction and suffering joyfully, forever (hence the ideas of [[amor fati]] and [[eternal recurrence]]).&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; Pessimism for Nietzsche is an art of living that is "good for one's health" as a "remedy and an aid in the service of growing and struggling life".&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albert Camus===
[[Image:Punishment sisyph.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Camus used the punishment of [[Sisyphus]] to represent the human condition.]]

In a 1945 article, [[Albert Camus]] wrote "the idea that a pessimistic philosophy is necessarily one of discouragement is a puerile idea."&lt;ref name="Camus"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.epubbud.com/read.php?g=DV6H76TX&amp;tocp=13|title= Albert Camus, ''Pessimism and Courage''}}, ''Combat'', September 1945&lt;/ref&gt; Camus helped popularize the idea of "[[Absurdism|the absurd]]", a key term in his famous essay ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]''. Like previous philosophical pessimists, Camus sees human consciousness and reason as that which "sets me in opposition to all creation".&lt;ref name="CamusMyth"&gt;{{cite book |last=Camus |first=Albert |authorlink=Albert Camus |title=Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essays |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=978-0-679-73373-7 |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Camus, this clash between a reasoning mind which craves meaning and a 'silent' world is what produces the most important philosophical problem, the 'problem of suicide'. Camus believed that people often escape facing the absurd through "eluding" (''l'esquive''), a 'trickery' for "those who live not for life itself but some great idea that will transcend it, refine it, give it a meaning, and betray it".&lt;ref name="CamusMyth" /&gt; He considered [[suicide]] and [[religion]] as inauthentic forms of eluding or escaping the problem of existence. For Camus, the only choice was to rebelliously accept and live with the absurd, for "there is no fate that cannot be surmounted by scorn." Camus' response to the absurd problem is illustrated by using the Greek mythic character of [[Sisyphus]], who was condemned by the gods to push a boulder up a hill for eternity. Camus imagines Sisyphus while pushing the rock, realizing the futility of his task, but doing it anyway out of rebellion: "One must imagine Sisyphus happy."

==Other forms==

=== Epistemological ===
There are several theories of [[epistemology]] which could arguably be said to be pessimistic in the sense that they consider it difficult or even impossible to obtain knowledge about the world. These ideas are generally related to [[nihilism]], [[philosophical skepticism]] and [[relativism]].

[[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]] (1743–1819), analyzed [[rationalism]], and in particular [[Immanuel Kant]]'s "critical" philosophy in order to carry out a [[reductio ad absurdum]]{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} according to which all rationalism reduces to [[nihilism]], and thus it should be avoided and replaced with a return to some type of [[faith]] and [[revelation]].

[[Richard Rorty]], [[Michel Foucault]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] questioned whether our particular concepts could relate to the world in any absolute way and whether we can justify our ways of describing the world as compared with other ways. In general, these philosophers argue that truth was not about getting it right or representing reality, but was part of subjective [[Foucauldian discourse analysis|social relations of power]], or [[language-games]] that served our purposes in a particular time. Therefore, these forms of [[anti-foundationalism]], while not being pessimistic per se, rejects any definitions that claims to have discovered absolute 'truths' or foundational facts about the world as valid.

===Political and cultural===
{{Main article|Cultural pessimism}}
Philosophical pessimism stands opposed to the [[optimism]] or even [[utopianism]] of [[Hegelian]] philosophies. [[Emil Cioran]] claimed "Hegel is chiefly responsible for modern optimism. How could he have failed to see that consciousness changes only its forms and modalities, but never progresses?"&lt;ref name="Cioran"&gt;Cioran, Emil. ''A short history of decay'', pg 146&lt;/ref&gt;  Philosophical pessimism is differentiated from other political philosophies by having no ideal governmental structure or political project, rather pessimism generally tends to be an anti-systematic philosophy of individual action.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dienstag|2009|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because philosophical pessimists tend to be skeptical that any politics of [[social progress]] can actually improve the human condition. As Cioran states, "every step forward is followed by a step back: this is the unfruitful oscillation of history".&lt;ref&gt;Cioran, Emil. ''A short history of decay'', pg 178&lt;/ref&gt; Cioran also attacks political optimism because it creates an "idolatry of tomorrow" which can be used to authorize anything in its name. This does not mean however, that the pessimist cannot be politically involved, as Camus argued in [[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]].

There is another strain of thought generally associated with a pessimistic worldview, this is the pessimism of [[cultural criticism]] and [[social decline]] which is seen in [[Oswald Spengler]]'s '[[The Decline of the West]]'. Spengler promoted a [[cyclic history|cyclic model of history]] similar to the theories of [[Giambattista Vico]]. Spengler believed modern [[western civilization]] was in the 'winter' age of decline (''untergang''). Spenglerian theory was immensely influential in interwar Europe, especially in [[Weimar Germany]]. Similarly, traditionalist [[Julius Evola]] thought that the world was in the [[Kali Yuga]], a dark age of moral decline.

Intellectuals like [[Oliver James (psychologist)|Oliver James]] correlate economic progress with [[economic inequality]], the stimulation of artificial needs, and [[affluenza]]. [[Anti-consumerist]]s identify rising trends of [[conspicuous consumption]] and self-interested, image-conscious behavior in culture. Post-modernists like [[Jean Baudrillard]] have even argued that culture (and therefore our lives) now has no basis in reality whatsoever.&lt;ref name="ben"/&gt;

[[Conservative]] thinkers, especially [[social conservatives]], often perceive politics in a generally pessimistic way. [[William F. Buckley]] famously remarked that he was "standing athwart history yelling 'stop!'" and [[Whittaker Chambers]] was convinced that capitalism was bound to fall to [[communism]], though he was himself violently [[anti-communist]]. Social conservatives often see the West as a decadent and nihilistic civilization which has abandoned its roots in [[Christianity]] and/or [[Greeks|Greek]] [[philosophy]], leaving it doomed to fall into moral and political decay. [[Robert Bork]]'s ''Slouching Toward Gomorrah'' and [[Allan Bloom]]'s ''The Closing of the American Mind'' are famous expressions of this point of view.

Many economic conservatives and [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] believe that the expansion of the state and the role of government in society is inevitable, and they are at best fighting a holding action against it.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} They hold that the natural tendency of people is to be ruled and that freedom is an exceptional state of affairs which is now being abandoned in favor of social and economic security provided by the [[welfare state]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Political pessimism has sometimes found expression in [[dystopian]] novels such as [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Lowenthal |first=D |title=Orwell's Political Pessimism in '1984' |publisher=Polity |year=1969 |jstor=3234097}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political pessimism about one's country often correlates with a desire to [[emigrate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Brym |first=RJ |title=The emigration potential of Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland and Russia: recent survey results |publisher=International Sociology |year=1992 |url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/soc101y/brym/is.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]] in the United States, the [[neologism]] "[[pessimism porn]]" was coined to describe the alleged [[Eschatology|eschatological]] and [[survivalist]] thrill some people derive from predicting, reading and fantasizing about the collapse of civil society through the destruction of the world's economic system.&lt;ref name=Lindgren&gt;[http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/53858/ Pessimism Porn: A soft spot for hard times], Hugo Lindgren, ''New York'', February 9, 2009; accessed July 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=7299825&amp;page=1 Pessimism Porn? Economic Forecasts Get Lurid], Dan Harris, ABC News, April 9, 2009; accessed July 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mary&gt;''Apocalypse and Post-Politics: The Romance of the End'', Mary Manjikian, Lexington Books, March 15, 2012, {{ISBN|0739166220}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schott&gt;[http://schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/23/pessimism-porn/ Pessimism Porn: Titillatingly bleak media reports], Ben Schott, ''New York Times'', February 23, 2009; accessed July 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technological and environmental===
[[File:FrameBreaking-1812.jpg|thumb|right|Luddites destroy machines (1812)]]
Technological pessimism is the belief that advances in science and technology do not lead to an improvement in the human condition. Technological pessimism can be said to have originated during the [[industrial revolution]] with the [[Luddite]] movement. Luddites blamed the rise of industrial mills and advanced factory machinery for the loss of their jobs and set out to destroy them. The [[Romantic movement]] was also pessimistic towards the rise of technology and longed for simpler and more natural times. Poets like [[William Wordsworth]] and [[William Blake]] believed that industrialization was polluting the purity of nature.&lt;ref name=romanticism&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/hum_303/romanticism.html |title=Romanticism |publisher=Wsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718052334/http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/hum_303/romanticism.html |archivedate=2008-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some social critics and environmentalists believe that [[globalization]], [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] and the economic practices of modern [[capitalist]] states over-stress the planet's [[Balance of nature|ecological equilibrium]]. They warn that unless something is done to slow this, [[climate change]] will worsen eventually leading to some form of social and [[ecological collapse]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The New York Review of Books]] [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2006/apr/27/the-global-delusion/ The Global Delusion, John Gray]&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Lovelock]] believes that the [[ecology]] of the Earth has already been irretrievably damaged, and even an unrealistic shift in politics would not be enough to save it. According to Lovelock, the Earth’s climate regulation system is being overwhelmed by pollution and the Earth will soon jump from its current state into a dramatically hotter climate.&lt;ref name="nybooks.com"&gt;[[The New York Review of Books]] [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/nov/19/a-great-jump-to-disaster/ A Great Jump to Disaster?, Tim Flannery]&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelock blames this state of affairs on what he calls “polyanthroponemia”, which is when: “humans overpopulate until they do more harm than good.” Lovelock states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The presence of 7 billion people aiming for first-world comforts…is clearly incompatible with the homeostasis of climate but also with chemistry, biological diversity and the economy of the system.&lt;ref name="nybooks.com"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some [[radical environmentalism|radical environmentalists]], [[anti-globalization]] activists, and [[Neo-luddism|Neo-luddites]] can be said to hold to this type of pessimism about the effects of modern "progress". A more radical form of environmental pessimism is [[anarcho-primitivism]] which faults the [[British Agricultural Revolution|agricultural revolution]] with giving rise to social stratification, coercion, and alienation. Some anarcho-primitivists promote [[deindustrialization]], abandonment of modern technology and [[rewilding (anarchism)|rewilding]].

An infamous anarcho-primitivist is [[Theodore Kaczynski]], also known as the Unabomber who engaged in a nationwide mail bombing campaign. In his 1995 manifesto, ''Industrial Society and Its Future'' he called attention to the erosion of human freedom by the rise of the modern "industrial-technological system".&lt;ref&gt;[[The Washington Post]]: Unabomber Special Report: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/unabomber/manifesto.text.htm INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY AND ITS FUTURE]&lt;/ref&gt; The manifesto begins thus: &lt;blockquote&gt;The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the most radical pessimist organizations is the [[voluntary human extinction movement]] which argues for the extinction of the human race through [[antinatalism]].

[[Pope Francis]]' controversial [[Laudato si'|2015 encyclical on ecological issues]] is ripe with [[Laudato si'#Technology|pessimistic assessments of the role of technology in the modern world]].

====Entropy pessimism====
{{See also |Heat death of the universe |Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen #The relevance of thermodynamics to economics |Ecological economics #Methodology}}
[[File:Diagram of natural resource flows.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2 |Natural resources flow through the economy and end up as waste and pollution.]]
'Entropy pessimism' represents a special case of technological and environmental pessimism, based on [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic principles]].&lt;ref name=ra01/&gt;{{rp|116}} According to the [[Laws of thermodynamics#First law|first law of thermodynamics]], matter and energy is neither created nor destroyed in the economy. According to the [[Laws of thermodynamics#Second law|second law of thermodynamics]] — also known as [[Entropy|the entropy law]] — what happens in the economy is that all matter and energy is transformed from states available for human purposes (valuable [[natural resource]]s) to states unavailable for human purposes (valueless [[waste]] and [[pollution]]). In effect, all of man's technologies and activities are only speeding up the general march against a future planetary 'heat death' of degraded energy, exhausted natural resources and a deteriorated environment — a state of maximum entropy locally on earth; 'locally' on earth, that is, when compared to the [[heat death of the universe]], taken as a whole.

The term 'entropy pessimism' was coined to describe the work of [[Romanian American]] economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]], a [[List of people considered father or mother of a scientific field |progenitor]] in [[economics]] and the [[Paradigm shift#Kuhnian paradigm shifts |paradigm founder]] of [[ecological economics]].&lt;ref name=ra01/&gt;{{rp|116}} Georgescu-Roegen made extensive use of the entropy concept in his [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen #Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|magnum opus on ''The Entropy Law and the Economic Process'']].&lt;ref name=ngr01/&gt; Since the 1990s, leading ecological economist and [[Steady-state economy #Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]] — a student of Georgescu-Roegen — has been the economists profession's most influential proponent of entropy pessimism.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt; &lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|545}}

Among other matters, the entropy pessimism position is concerned with the existential impossibility of allocating earth's finite stock of mineral resources evenly among an unknown number of present and future generations. This number of generations is likely to remain unknown to us, as there is no way — or only little way — of knowing in advance if or when [[Human extinction|mankind will ultimately face extinction]]. In effect, ''any'' conceivable intertemporal allocation of the stock will inevitably end up with universal economic decline at some future point.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|369-371}} &lt;ref name=jr01/&gt;{{rp|253-256}} &lt;ref name=kb01/&gt;{{rp|165}} &lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|168-171}} &lt;ref name=jg01/&gt;{{rp|150-153}} &lt;ref name=js01/&gt;{{rp|106-109}} &lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|546-549}} &lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|142-145}}

Entropy pessimism is a widespread view in [[ecological economics]] and in the [[Degrowth|degrowth movement]].

===Legal===
Bibas writes that some [[criminal defense attorney]]s prefer to err on the side of pessimism: "Optimistic forecasts risk being proven disastrously wrong at trial, an embarrassing result that makes clients angry. On the other hand, if clients plead based on their lawyers' overly pessimistic advice, the cases do not go to trial and the clients are none the wiser."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Bibas |first=Stephanos |title=Plea Bargaining outside the Shadow of Trial |publisher=Harvard Law Review |volume=117 |number=8 |date=Jun 2004 |pages=2463–2547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a psychological disposition==
[[File:Оптимист и пессимист.jpg|thumb|220px|''An optimist and a pessimist'', [[Vladimir Makovsky]], 1893]]
In the ancient world, psychological pessimism was associated with [[Melancholia|melancholy]], and was believed to be caused by an excess of black bile in the body. 
The study of pessimism has parallels with the study of [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. Psychologists trace pessimistic attitudes to emotional [[suffering|pain]] or even biology. [[Aaron Beck]] argues that depression is due to unrealistic negative views about the world.  Beck starts treatment by engaging in conversation with clients about their unhelpful thoughts. Pessimists, however, are often able to provide arguments that suggest that their understanding of reality is justified; as in [[Depressive realism]] or ([[Cultural pessimism|pessimistic realism]]).&lt;ref name="ben"/&gt; Deflection is a common method used by those who are depressed. They let people assume they are revealing everything which proves to be an effective way of hiding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kirszner |first=Laurie |date=January 2012 |title=Patterns for College Writing |location=United States |publisher=Bedford/St.Martins |page=477 |isbn=978-0-312-67684-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pessimism item on the [[Beck Depression Inventory]] has been judged useful in predicting suicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=AT |last=Beck |first2=RA |last2=Steer |first3=M |last3=Kovacs |title=Hopelessness and eventual suicide: a 10-year prospective study of patients hospitalized with suicidal ideation |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=142 |issue=5 |pages=559–563 |year=1985 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/142/5/559|doi=10.1176/ajp.142.5.559 |pmid=3985195 |citeseerx=10.1.1.462.6328 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Beck Hopelessness Scale]] has also been described as a measurement of pessimism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=AT |last=Beck |first2=A |last2=Weissman |first3=D |last3=Lester |first4=L |last4=Trexler |title=The measurement of pessimism: the hopelessness scale |publisher=Journal of Consulting and Clinical |year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wender and Klein point out that pessimism can be useful in some circumstances: "If one is subject to a series of defeats, it pays to adopt a conservative game plan of sitting back and waiting and letting others take the risks. Such waiting would be fostered by a pessimistic outlook. Similarly if one is raking in the chips of life, it pays to adopt an expansive risk taking approach, and thus maximize access to scarce resources."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Wender |first=PH |last2=Klein |first2=DF |title=Mind, Mood and Medicine |publisher=New American Library |year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Pragmatic criticism===
Through history, some have concluded that a pessimistic attitude, although justified, must be avoided in order to endure. Optimistic attitudes are favored and of emotional consideration.&lt;ref&gt;
Michael R. Michau. "Doing, Suffering, and Creating": William James and Depression.  http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~mmichau/james-and-depression.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Ghazali]] and [[William James]] rejected their pessimism after suffering [[psychological illness|psychological]], or even [[psychosomatic]] illness. Criticisms of this sort however assume that pessimism leads inevitably to a mood of darkness and utter depression. Many philosophers would disagree, claiming that the term "pessimism" is being abused. The link between pessimism and [[nihilism]] is present, but the former does not necessarily lead to the latter, as philosophers such as Albert Camus believed. Happiness is not inextricably linked to [[optimism]], nor is pessimism inextricably linked to unhappiness. One could easily imagine an unhappy optimist, and a happy pessimist. Accusations of pessimism may be used to silence legitimate criticism. The economist [[Nouriel Roubini]] was largely dismissed as a pessimist, for his dire but accurate predictions of a coming global financial crisis, in 2006. ''[[Personality Plus]]'' opines that pessimistic temperaments (e.g. [[melancholy temperament|melancholy]] and [[phlegmatic temperament|phlegmatic]]) can be useful inasmuch as pessimists' focus on the negative helps them spot problems that people with more optimistic temperaments (e.g. [[choleric temperament|choleric]] and [[sanguine temperament|sanguine]]) miss.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5077">'''Planar chirality''' is the special case of [[Chirality (mathematics)|chirality]] for two [[dimension]]s.

Most fundamentally, planar [[Chirality (mathematics)|chirality]] is a [[Mathematics|mathematical]] term, finding use in [[chemistry]], [[physics]] and related physical sciences, for example, in [[astronomy]], [[optics]] and [[metamaterials]]. Recent occurrences in latter two fields are dominated by [[microwave]] applications and micro- and [[nanostructure]]d planar interfaces for visible and [[infrared]] [[light]].

Planar chirality is also exhibited by molecules like (''E'')-[[cyclooctene]], some di- or poly-substituted [[metallocene]]s, and certain monosubstituted [[paracyclophane]]s. Nature rarely provides planar chiral molecules, [[cavicularin]] being an exception.

=== Assigning the configuration of planar chiral molecules ===
To assign the configuration of a planar chiral molecule, begin by selecting the pilot atom, which is the [[Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules|highest priority]] of the atoms that is not in the plane, but are directly attached to an atom in the plane. Next, assign the priority of three adjacent in-plane atoms, starting with the atom attached to the pilot atom as priority 1, and preferentially assigning in order of highest priority if there is a choice. When viewed from the side of the pilot atom, if the three atoms form a clockwise direction when followed in order of priority, the molecule is assigned as R, otherwise it is assigned as S.&lt;ref&gt;Kalsi, P.S. [https://books.google.com/books?id=XLWpHCMP63YC "Stereochemistry Conformation and Mechanism"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In optics and metamaterials ==
The study of planar chiral [[metamaterial]]s has revealed that planar chirality is associated with an optical effect: the directionally asymmetric transmission (reflection and absorption) of [[Circular polarization|circularly polarized]] waves. Planar chiral metamaterials, which are also anisotropic and lossy exhibit different total transmission (reflection and absorption) levels for the same circularly polarized wave incident on their front and back.
The asymmetric transmission phenomenon arises from different, e.g. left-to-right, circular polarization conversion efficiencies for opposite propagation directions of the incident wave and therefore the effect is referred to as circular conversion dichroism.
Like the twist of a planar chiral pattern appears reversed for opposite directions of observation, planar chiral metamaterials have interchanged properties for left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized waves that are incident on their front and back. In particular left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized waves experience opposite directional transmission (reflection and absorption) asymmetries.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Plastination''' is a technique or process used in [[anatomy]] to preserve bodies or body parts, first developed by [[Gunther von Hagens]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/plastination/idea_plastination.html |title=The Idea behind plastination |publisher=Institute for Plastination |accessdate=1 May 2012 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The water and [[fat]] are replaced by certain [[plastic]]s, yielding specimens that can be touched, do not smell or [[bacterial decay|decay]], and even retain most properties of the original sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. H. |last=Weiglein |title=Overview &amp; General Principles of the Plastination Procedures |journal=8th Interim Conf Plast |year=2005 |url=http://www.uqtr.uquebec.ca/plastination/Abstracts-2005.html#Weiglein-01-2005 |accessdate=27 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
[[File:PlastinationProcess EN.svg|thumb|The centerpiece of plastination: "forced impregnation"]]

Four steps are used in the standard process of plastination: fixation, [[dehydration]], forced impregnation in a [[vacuum]], and hardening.&lt;ref name=hagans1987&gt;{{cite journal |first=Gunther |last=von Hagens |authorlink=Gunther von Hagens |author2=Klaus Tiedemann |author3=Wilhelm Kriz |title=The current potential of plastination |journal=Anatomy and Embryology |volume=175 |issue=4 |pages=411–21 |year=1987 |pmid=3555158 |doi=10.1007/BF00309677 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Water and [[lipid]] tissues are replaced by curable polymers, which include [[silicone]], [[epoxy]], and [[polyester]]-[[copolymer]].&lt;ref name=hagans1987/&gt;

The first step of plastination, fixation,&lt;ref name=henry1997&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert W. |last=Henry |author2=Larry Janick |author3=Francis Paul Salmos |date=February 1997 |title=Specimen preparation for silicone plastination |journal=Journal of the International Society for Plastination |issn=1090-2171 |url=https://www.uqtr.ca/plast-journal/vol12/1_Henry_13a17.pdf |volume=12 |issue=1 |accessdate=27 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  frequently uses a [[formaldehyde]]-based solution, and serves two functions. Dissecting the specimen to show specific anatomical elements can be time consuming. Formaldehyde or other preserving solutions help prevent [[decomposition]] of the tissues. They may also confer a degree of rigidity. This can be beneficial in maintaining the shape or arrangement of a specimen. A stomach might be inflated or a leg bent at the knee, for example.

After any necessary [[dissection]]s have taken place, the specimen is placed in a bath of [[acetone]] (freezing point −95°&amp;nbsp;C) at −20° to −30°&amp;nbsp;C. The volume of the bath should be 10 times that of the specimen. The acetone is renewed two times over the course of six weeks. The acetone draws out all the water and replaces it inside the [[Cell (biology)|cells]].&lt;ref name=bickley1987&gt;{{cite journal |first=Harmon C. |last=Bickley |author2=Robert S. Conner, Anna N. Walker and R. Lamar Jackson |date=January 1987 |title=Preservation of tissue by silicone rubber impregnation |url=http://journal.plastination.org/archive/jp_vol.01.1/jp_vol.01.1_030-039.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150624022306/http://journal.plastination.org/archive/jp_vol.01.1/jp_vol.01.1_030-039.pdf |archivedate=2015-06-24|dead-url=no |journal=Journal of the International Society for Plastination |issn=1090-2171 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=30–39 |accessdate=10 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third step, the specimen is then placed in a bath of liquid polymer, such as [[silicone rubber]], [[polyester]], or [[epoxy resin]]. By creating a [[vacuum]], the acetone is made to boil at a low temperature. As the acetone [[vaporization|vaporizes]] and leaves the cells, it draws the liquid polymer in behind it, leaving a cell filled with liquid plastic.&lt;ref name=bickley1987/&gt;

The plastic must then be cured with gas, heat, or [[ultraviolet light]],  to harden it.&lt;ref name=henry1997/&gt;

A specimen can vary from a full [[human body]] to a small piece of an animal organ, and they are known as 'plastinates'.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Once plastinated, the specimens and bodies are further manipulated and positioned prior to curing (hardening) of the polymer chains.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

==History==
In November 1979, [[Gunther von Hagens]] applied for a German patent, proposing the idea of preserving animal and vegetable tissues permanently by synthetic resin impregnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ref patent |country=DE |number=2710147 |status=patent |title=Präparat aus biologischen verweslichen Objekten und Verfahren zu ihrer Herstellung |gdate=14 September 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, von Hagens has applied for further US patents regarding work on preserving biological tissues with polymers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ref patent |country=US |number=4205059 |status=patent |title=Animal and vegetal tissues permanently preserved by synthetic resin  |gdate=27 May 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Ref patent |country=US |number=4320157 |status=patent |title=Method for preserving large sections of biological tissue with polymers  |gdate=16 March 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the success of his patents, von Hagens went on to form the Institute for Plastination in Heidelberg, Germany in 1993.  The Institute for Plastination, along with von Hagens, made their first showing of plastinated bodies in Japan in 1995, which drew more than three million visitors. The institute maintains three international centres of plastination, in Germany, Kyrgyzstan, and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biodurproducts.com/en/plastination/preservation_plastination.html |title=Preservation by Plastination |publisher=BIODUR |accessdate=5 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related preservation methods==
Other methods have been in place for thousands of years to halt the decomposition of the body. [[Mummy|Mummification]] used by the [[ancient Egypt]]ians is a widely-known method which involves the removal of body fluid and wrapping the body in linens. Prior to mummification, Egyptians would lay the body in a shallow pit in the desert and allow the sun to dehydrate the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Eric |last=Rymer |url=http://historylink101.net/egypt_1/religion_mummification_history.htm |title=History of Burial Beliefs in Ancient Egypt |publisher=History Link 101 |accessdate=11 May 2009}}{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Formalin]], an important solution to body preservation, was introduced in 1896 to help with body preservation. Soon to follow formalin, color-preserving embalming solutions were developed to preserve life-like color and flexibility to aid in the study of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.funeralmuseum.org/pdf/formaldehyde.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050306094856/http://www.funeralmuseum.org/pdf/formaldehyde.pdf |archivedate=6 March 2005 |title=Formaldehyde: Its Development And History Since 1868 |publisher=[[Museum of Funeral Customs]] |accessdate=11 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paraffin wax|Paraffin]] impregnation was introduced in 1925, and the embedding of organs in plastic was developed in the 1960s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Body preservation methods current to the 21st century are [[cryopreservation]], which involves the cooling of the body to very low temperatures to preserve the body tissues, plastination, and [[embalming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Ref patent |country=US |number=5089288 |status=patent |title=Method for Impregnating Tissue Samples in Paraffin |gdate=18 February 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other methods used in modern times include the Silicone S 10 Standard Procedure, the Cor-Tech Room temperature procedure, the Epoxy E 12 procedure, and the Polyester P 35 (P 40) procedure.&lt;ref name=Other&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meduni02.edis.at/plast/plmeth.html |title=Other Plastination Methods |publisher=International Society for Plastination |accessdate=19 May 2009 |date=20 October 1998 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515122825/http://meduni02.edis.at/plast/plmeth.html |archivedate=15 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Silicone S 10 is the procedure most often used in plastination and creates opaque, natural-looking specimen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isp.plastination.org/silicone.html |title=The Silicone S 10 |publisher=International Society for Plastination |accessdate=19 May 2009 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dow Corning Corporation]]'s Cor-Tech Room Temperature Procedure is designed to allow plastination of specimen at [[room temperature]] to various degrees of flexibility using three combinations of polymer, [[crosslinker]], and [[catalyst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isp.plastination.org/cortech.html |title=The COR-TECH Room Temperature |publisher=International Society for Plastination |accessdate=19 May 2009 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the International Society for Plastination, the Epoxy E 12 procedure is used "for thin, transparent, and firm body and organ slices", while the Polyster P 35 (P 40) preserves "semitransparent and firm brain slices".&lt;ref name=Other/&gt; Samples are prepared for fixation through the first method by deep freezing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isp.plastination.org/epoxy.html |title=The Epoxy E 12 |publisher=International Society for Plastination |accessdate=19 May 2009 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the second method works best following 4–6 weeks of preparation in a formaldehyde mixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isp.plastination.org/polyester.html |title=The Polyester P35/P40 |publisher=International Society for Plastination |accessdate=19 May 2009 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses of plastinated specimens==
Plastination is useful in anatomy, serving as models and teaching tools.&lt;ref name=nexusfall2004&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nyu.edu/dental/nexus/issues/fall2004/vonhagens.html |title=Life, Death, and One Man's Quest to Demystify the Inner Realms of the Human Body |journal=Nexus |date=Fall 2004 |accessdate=13 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used at more than 40 [[medical school|medical]] and [[dental school]]s throughout the world as an adjunct to anatomical dissection.
[[File:Histological section of bovine tongue.jpg|thumb|Histological section of bovine tongue, epoxy technique]]
Students enrolled in introductory [[animal science]] courses at many universities learn animal science through collections of multispecies large-animal specimens. Plastination allows students to have hands-on experience in this field, without exposure to chemicals such as formalin. For example, plastinated [[dog|canine]] [[gastrointestinal]] tracts are used to help in the teaching of [[endoscopy|endoscopic]] technique and anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=L. |last=Janick |author2=R. C. DeNovo |author3=R. W. Henry |year=1997 |title=Plastinated Canine Gastrointestinal Tracts Used to Facilitate Teaching of Endoscopic Technique and Anatomy |journal=Cells Tissues Organs |volume=158 |page=48 |doi=10.1159/000147910}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plastinated specimens retain their dilated conformation by a [[positive pressure]] air flow during the curing process, which allows them to be used to teach both endoscopic technique and gastrointestinal anatomy.

With the use of plastination as a teaching method of animal science, fewer animals have to be [[animal research|killed for research]], as the plastination process allows specimens to be studied for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vet.ksu.edu/depts/ap/tour/labs/plastination.htm |title=KSUCVM Plastination Laboratory |publisher=Vet.ksu.edu |date=8 January 2009 |accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[North Carolina State University]]'s College of Veterinary Medicine in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], uses both plastic coating (PC) and plastination (PN) to investigate and compare the difference in the two methods. The PC method was simple and inexpensive, but the PN specimens were more flexible, durable, and life-like than those preserved by the PC method. The use of plastination allowed the use of many body parts such as muscle, nerves, bones, [[ligaments]], and [[central nervous system]] to be preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Holladay SD, Hudson LC |title=Use of plastinated brains in teaching neuroanatomy at the North Carolina State University, College of Veterinary Medicine |journal=Journal of the International Society for Plastination |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=15–17 |year=1989 |url=https://www.uqtr.ca/plast-journal/vol3/Holladay_15a17.pdf |accessdate=19 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio]] was the first school in the United States to use this technique to prepare gross organ specimens for use in teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pathology.uthscsa.edu/parc/index.shtml |title=Pathology Academic Resource Center: UT Health Science Center - Graduate School of Biomedical Science |publisher=pathology.uthscsa.edu |accessdate=2010-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New York University College of Dentistry]].,&lt;ref name=nexusfall2004/&gt; [[Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.welcometopcom.com/tours/phl-anatomy.php |title=Virtual Campus Tour: PCOM Anatomy Lab |publisher=PCOM.edu |accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[University of Warwick]], and University of Northumbria &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.european-hospital.com/topics/article/4657.html |title=First University to Acquire von Hagens Plastinations for University Teaching |publisher=European-hospital.com |date=28 October 2008 |accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; use collections of plastinates as teaching aids.

==Ethical concerns==
Concern over consent of bodies being used in the plastination process has arisen. Over 20 years ago, von Hagens set up a [[body donation]] program in [[Germany]] and has signed over 9,000 donors into the plastinate program: 531 have already died. The program has reported an average of one body a day being released to the plastination process. About 90% of the donors registered are German. Although von Hagens says he follows strict consent procedures for whole-body specimens, he maintains, "consent is not important for body parts".{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}{{clarify|date=April 2015}} Von Hagens' body donations are now being managed by the Institute for Plastination (IfP)&lt;ref name="bodyworlds1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/institute_for_plastination/mission_objectives.html |title=Institute |publisher=Bodyworlds.com |accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; established in 1993.&lt;ref name="pmid12609939"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Debashis |last=Singh |title=Scientist or showman? |journal=BMJ |volume=326 |issue=7387 |page=468 |date=March 2003 |pmid=12609939 |pmc=1125369 |doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7387.468 |url= |last2=Von Hagens |first2=G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plastination exhibitions==
For the first 20 years, plastination was used to preserve small specimens for medical study. In the early 1990s, the equipment was developed to make plastinating whole body specimens possible, each specimen taking up to 1,500 man-hours to prepare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/leonardopodcast/TheLeonardoPodcast1.mp3 |title=TheLeonardo Podcast no. 1 |format=[[MP3]] |date=19 September 2008 |first=Ross |last=Chambless |accessdate=8 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first exhibition of whole bodies was displayed by von Hagens in Japan in 1995.

Over the next two years, Von Hagens developed the ''Körperwelten'' ([[Body Worlds]]) public exhibitions, showing whole bodies plastinated in life-like poses and dissected to show various structures and systems of human anatomy. The earliest exhibitions were presented in the [[Far East]] and in Germany, and Gunther von Hagens'  exhibitions have subsequently been hosted by museums and venues in more than 50 cities worldwide, attracting more than 29 million visitors.{{Citation needed|reason=a specific page with this specific information needs to be cited, not just the main body worlds website|date=May 2009}}.

Gunther von Hagens' Body Worlds exhibitions are the original, precedent-setting public anatomical exhibitions of real human bodies, and the only anatomical exhibits that use donated bodies, willed by donors to the Institute for Plastination for the express purpose of serving the Body Worlds mission to educate the public about health and anatomy. To date, more than 10,000 people have agreed to donate their bodies to Institute for Plastination.&lt;ref name="bodyworlds1"/&gt;

In 2004, [[Premier Exhibitions]] began their "Bodies Revealed" exhibition in [[Blackpool, England]], which ran from August through October 2004.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} In 2005 and 2006, the company opened their "Bodies Revealed" and "Bodies...The Exhibition" in [[Seoul]], [[Tampa]], and [[New York City]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The West Coast exhibition site opened on 22 June 2006 at the Tropicana Resort and Casino Las Vegas.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} {{As of|2009|06}}, [[BODIES...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14878">"'''Precambrian rabbits'''" or "'''fossil rabbits in the Precambrian'''" are reported to have been among responses given by the biologist [[J.B.S. Haldane]] when asked what [[evidence]] could destroy his confidence in the [[theory of evolution]] and the field of study. The answers became popular [[image]]ry in debates about evolution and the scientific field of [[evolutionary biology]] in the 1990s. Many of Haldane's statements about his scientific research were popularized in his lifetime.

Some accounts use this response to rebut claims that the [[theory]] of evolution is [[Objections to evolution#Evolution is unfalsifiable|not falsifiable]] by any [[empirical evidence]]. This followed an assertion by philosopher, [[Karl Popper]], who had proposed that [[Falsifiability|''falsifiability'']] is an essential feature of a scientific theory. Popper also expressed doubts about the scientific status of evolutionary theory, although he later concluded that the field of study was genuinely scientific.

[[Rabbits]] are [[mammal]]s. From the perspective of the [[philosophy of science]], it is doubtful whether the genuine discovery of mammalian [[fossil]]s in [[Precambrian]] rocks would overthrow the theory of evolution instantly, though if authentic, such a discovery would indicate serious errors in modern understanding about the evolutionary process. Mammals are a class of animals whose emergence in the [[geologic timescale]] is dated to much later than any found in Precambrian strata. Geological records indicate that although the first true mammals appeared in the [[Triassic]] period, modern mammalian orders appeared in the [[Palaeocene]] and [[Eocene]] epochs of the [[Palaeogene]] period. Hundreds of millions of years separate this period from the Precambrian.

==Origin of the phrase==

Several authors have written that J.B.S. Haldane (1892–1964) said that the discovery of a [[fossil]] [[rabbit]] in Precambrian rocks would be enough to destroy his belief in [[evolution]].&lt;ref name="Ridley2004Evolution"&gt;{{cite book

==Theoretical background==
The philosopher [[Karl Popper]] held that any scientific proposition must be falsifiable, in other words it must at least be possible to [[thought experiment|imagine some reproducible experiment or observation]] whose outcome would disprove the hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Hull1999UseAndAbuseOfPopper" /&gt; Initially he thought that [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[natural selection]] (often summarized as "the survival of the fittest"&lt;ref name=OriginCh4&gt;"This preservation of favourable individual differences and variations, and the destruction of those which are injurious, I have called Natural Selection, or the Survival of the Fittest." &amp;mdash; {{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although in 1978 Popper wrote that his earlier objection had been specifically to the theory of natural selection, in lectures and articles from 1949 to 1974 he had stated that "[[Darwinism]]" or "Darwin's theory of evolution" was a "metaphysical research programme" because it was not falsifiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact he continued to express dissatisfaction with contemporary statements of the theory of evolution which focused on [[population genetic]]s, the study of the relative frequencies of [[allele]]s (different forms of the same [[gene]]). Unfortunately some of the adjustments he proposed resembled [[Lamarckianism]] or [[saltation (biology)|saltationism]], evolutionary theories that were and still are considered obsolete, and evolutionary biologists therefore disregarded his criticisms.&lt;ref name="Hull1999UseAndAbuseOfPopper"&gt;{{cite journal

| pages=481 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 Popper complained that he had been misinterpreted as saying that "historical sciences" such as [[paleontology]] or the [[evolutionary history of life|history of evolution of life on Earth]] were not genuine sciences, when in fact he believed they could make falsifiable predictions.&lt;ref name="Hull1999UseAndAbuseOfPopper" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Further confusion arose in 1980–1981, when there was a long debate in the pages of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' about the scientific status of the theory of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Editorial |title= How true is the theory of evolution? |url= |journal= Nature |volume= 290|issue= 5802 | pages= 75–76 |year= 1981 |pmid=7207599|doi= 10.1038/290075a0|bibcode= 1981Natur.290...75.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=johnson&gt;{{cite book| author= Johnson PE|title= Darwin on Trial|year= 2010 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YtrGVVwk5HsC&amp;dq |page= 238 | publisher=  InterVarsity Press |isbn= 9780830838318 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the argument was on the factors influencing and nature of the [[unit of selection]] in the genome, with one side positing natural selection,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Orgel LE, Crick FH |title= Selfish DNA: the ultimate parasite |url= |journal= Nature |volume= 284|issue= 5757 | pages=604–607  |year=1980  |pmid=7366731 |doi= 10.1038/284604a0|bibcode=1980Natur.284..604O}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Cavalier-Smith T |title= How selfish is DNA? |url= |journal= Nature |volume= 285|issue= 5767 | pages=617–618  |year=1980  |pmid= 7393317 |doi= 10.1038/285617a0|bibcode= 1980Natur.285..617C}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the other, [[Neutral mutation theory|neutral mutation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dover G, Doolittle WF |title= Modes of genome evolution |url= |journal= Nature |volume=288|issue= 5792 | pages= 646–647 |year=1980 |pmid= 6256636|doi= 10.1038/288646a0|bibcode=1980Natur.288..646D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li WH, Gojobori T, Nei M |title= Pseudogenes as a paradigm of neutral evolution |url= |journal= Nature |volume=292|issue= 5820 | pages= 237–239 |year=1981 |pmid= 7254315|doi= 10.1038/292237a0|bibcode=1981Natur.292..237L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither of the parties seriously doubted that the theory was both scientific and, according to current scientific knowledge, true. Some participants objected to statements that appeared to present the theory of evolution as an absolute dogma, however, rather than as a hypothesis that so far has performed very well, and both sides quoted Popper in support of their positions. Evolution critics such as [[Phillip E. Johnson]] took this as an opportunity to declare that the theory of evolution was unscientific.&lt;ref name="Hull1999UseAndAbuseOfPopper" /&gt;&lt;ref name=johnson/&gt;

==Would anachronistic fossils disprove evolution?==
Evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] said that the discovery of [[fossil mammal]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s in Precambrian rocks would "completely blow evolution out of the water."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news 
| title=The Evolution Wars | author=Wallis, C. | newspaper=Time | date= August 7, 2005

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Peter Godfrey-Smith]] doubted that a single set of [[anachronistic]] fossils, however, even rabbits in the Precambrian, would disprove the theory of evolution outright. The first question raised by the assertion of such a discovery would be whether the alleged "Precambrian rabbits" really were fossilized rabbits. Alternative interpretations might include incorrect identification of the "fossils", incorrect dating of the rocks, and a [[hoax]] such as the [[Piltdown Man]] was shown to be. Even if the "Precambrian rabbits" turned out to be genuine, they would not instantly refute the theory of evolution, because that theory is a large package of ideas, including: that life on Earth has evolved over billions of years; that this evolution is driven by certain mechanisms; and that these mechanisms have produced a specific "family tree" that defines the relationships among species and the order in which they appeared. Hence, "Precambrian rabbits" would prove that there were one or more serious errors somewhere in this package, and the next task would be to identify those errors.&lt;ref name="GodfreySmith2003TheoryAndReality" /&gt;

Benton pointed out that, in the short term, scientists often have to accept the existence of competing hypotheses, each of which explains large parts&amp;mdash;but not all&amp;mdash;of the observed relevant data.&lt;ref name="BentonHitchin1996QualityOfFossilRecord" /&gt;

==Oldest rabbit==

Genuine fossils of earliest rabbits are from the [[Eocene]] [[epoch (geology)|Epoch]], about 56 to 33.9 million years ago. Members of the [[genus]] ''[[Gomphos]]'' are established to be the [[phylogenetic]] root of [[lagomorph]] rabbits and hares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Asher RJ, Meng J, Wible JR, McKenna MC, Rougier GW, Dashzeveg D, Novacek MJ |url= |title=Stem Lagomorpha and the antiquity of ''Glires'' | journal=Science |volume= 307|issue=5712 |pages= 1091–1094| year= 2005|pmid=15718468 |doi=10.1126/science.1107808|bibcode=2005Sci...307.1091A}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the oldest ''Gomphos'' is ''G. elkema'' discovered in 2008 from [[Gujarat]], [[India]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5610">'''Preventable years of life lost (PrYLL)''' is an epidemiological measure. It is an estimate of the average years a person would have lived if s/he had not died prematurely due to a preventable cause of death.

PrYLL is closely related to [[Years of potential life lost|potential years of life lost (PYLL)]] and like PYLL, it gives more weight than mortality rates to deaths that occur among younger people. Unlike PYLL, PrYLL excludes causes of death that aren’t deemed to be preventable.

Premature deaths are those that could be avoided through public health interventions such as getting people to take more exercise or stop smoking, or in tackling the wider social determinants of health.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/181103/Living_well_for_longer.pdf Living Well for Longer: A call to action to reduce avoidable premature mortality], Department of Health, March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
Causes of death can be classified using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd.htm Introduction to ICD codes] The Centre for Communicable Diseases.&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom’s [[Office of National Statistics|Office for National Statistics]] (ONS) has published lists of ICD codes that are deemed to be avoidable, amenable and preventable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/about-ons/get-involved/consultations/archived-consultations/2011/definitions-of-avoidable-mortality/consultation-on-definitions-of-avoidable-mortality.pdf Definitions of Avoidable Mortality] Office for National Statistics. February 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Within this publication, the ONS proposes the following definition for preventable causes of death: “A death is preventable if, in the light of current understanding of the determinants of health, all or most deaths from that cause (subject to age limits if appropriate) could be avoided by public health interventions in the broadest sense”.

==History==

PrYLL was developed in 2012 by Errol Taylor at [http://www.rospa.com/ The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents] (RoSPA) to highlight the burden to society of accidental injury.

PrYLL features prominently in RoSPA’s Big Book of Accident Prevention &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rospa.com/bigbook/index.html RoSPA’s Big Book of Accident Prevention] RoSPA. December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and RoSPA’s guidance for local government decision-makers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rospa.com/about/currentcampaigns/publichealth/info/delivering-accident-prevention-context.pdf Delivering Accident Prevention at Local Level] RoSPA June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; which was supported by Public Health England(PHE) and funded by the UK Department of Health.

==Calculation==

To calculate the preventable years of life lost, the analyst has to set an upper reference age. This is essentially arbitrary and can be set, for example, to 65 to capture the whole population up to retirement, or 75 which, in developed countries, corresponds roughly to the life expectancy of the population being studied.

The analyst must then select the ICD codes for causes of death that are deemed by the ONS to be preventable.  The calculation can then proceed in the same way as for [[years of potential life lost]] (PYLL).

==Significance==

In the developed world, mortality counts and rates tend to emphasise the most common causes of death in older people because the risk of death increases with age. Since PrYLL excludes causes that aren’t deemed to be preventable and it gives more weight to deaths among young individuals, it is a powerful metric for those who want to draw attention to the premature and preventable loss of human potential. Some might argue that causes of death with the highest PrYLL should attract the greatest share of research and funding for prevention campaigns.

==Comparison==

This table which contrasts the leading causes of death when measured first by PrYLL and then by the total number of deaths. The rankings are completely different, depending on which epidemiological measure is chosen. Accidental injuries rise from being the fifth cause of death in terms of mortality, to the leading cause in terms of PrYLL while cancers drop from being the leading cause of death to be being second when measured in terms of PrYLL.

'''Selfism''' refers to any philosophy, theory,  doctrine, or tendency that upholds explicitly [[selfish]] principles as being desirable. It is usually used [[pejoratively]].

==Definition==
The term "selfism" was used by [[Paul Vitz]] in his 1977 book ''Psychology as Religion: The Cult of Self-Worship''. Vitz deconstructs the selfist movement(s) and tries to uphold [[God]]-centered [[Altruism (ethics)|altruism]], and claims that all of modern-day [[liberalism]] and [[leftism]] are essentially selfist at their core. He lays the blame predominantly at the feet of [[Erik Erikson]], [[Erich Fromm]], and other prominent psychologists of the third quarter of the 20th century (c. 1950–1975 CE).

Explicit selfishness as a desirable end and moral good had diverse manifestations during that period, for example, in the writings of [[David Seabury]], [[Ayn Rand]], and even among some of Rand's near-opposites, such as Erikson and Fromm. Rand called her philosophy [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]]. Later popularizers of similar positions include [[Nathaniel Branden]], [[Paul Lepanto]], [[Robert Ringer]], [[Harry Browne]], and [[David Kelley]], among others. None of these named the system they espoused "selfism" or characterized it as "selfist", although both Seabury and Rand included the word "selfishness" in the titles of books presenting their views. Many of these figures were pro-[[Capitalism|capitalist]] [[Secularism|secularists]] ("[[Atheism|atheist]] capitalists"), but Seabury was a [[Christian]], while Erickson and Fromm were prominent [[Leftism|leftists]].

[[Anton LaVey]], founder of the [[Church of Satan]] and author of [[The Satanic Bible]], acknowledges [[Ayn Rand]] and [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] as a source of inspiration for [[LaVeyan Satanism]]. This form of Satanism holds the [[self]] above all else in similar fashion to Objectivism. Despite some similarities, they remain separate entities, as there are clear differences between the two concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Origins of selfist thought==
Some early examples of "selfist" thinking are the [[Ethical egoism|egoistic]] philosophies of [[Yangism]] in [[ancient China]] and of [[Cyrenaic]] [[hedonism]] in [[ancient Greece]].  Yangists followed the teachings of [[Yang Zhu]] and might have been influenced by [[Taoism]].  [[Cyrenaics]], founded by [[Aristippus of Cyrene]], were [[Religious skepticism|skeptics]] and [[Materialism|materialists]] (but perhaps nominally Greek [[Paganism|pagans]]). [[Thomas Hobbes]], who could also be viewed as ''selfist'', was a [[Materialism|materialist]] but also advocated loyalty to a strong government and [[state church]]. [[Joseph Butler]], whose philosophy is unmistakably selfist, was generally regarded as an [[First seven Ecumenical Councils|orthodox Christian]] and was canonized an [[Anglican]] [[saint]]. The views of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Max Stirner]] provide a more proximate link to the modern selfists.

'''''Shòu''''' ({{zh|s=寿|t=壽|p={{audio|Zh-shòu.ogg|shòu|help=no}}}}) is the Chinese word/character for "longevity".

== Use ==
Three of the most important goals in life in Chinese traditional thought are the propitious blessings of happiness (''fú'' 福), professional success or prosperity (''lù'' 禄), and longevity (''shòu'' 寿). These are visually represented by the three "star gods" of the same names ([[Fu Lu Shou|''Fú, Lù, Shòu'']]), commonly depicted as three male figurines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Duda |first=Margaret |title=Traditional Chinese  Toggles |publisher=EDM |year=2011 |page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; (each wearing a distinctive garment and holding an object that enables them to be differentiated), or the Chinese ideographs/characters themselves, or various homophones or objects with relevant attributes. ''Shòu'' is instantly recognizable. "He holds in his hand a large peach, and attached to his long staff are a gourd and a scroll. The stag and the bat both indicate ''fu'' happiness. The peach, gourd, and scroll are symbols of longevity."&lt;ref name=werner431&gt;{{cite book |last=Werner |first=E. T. C. |title=A Dictionary of Chinese Mythology |publisher=Kelly and Walsh |year=1932 |page=431}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most striking characteristic is, however, his large and high forehead, which earned him the title "Longevity Star Old-pate".&lt;ref name=werner431 /&gt;

The Chinese character ''shòu'' (寿) is usually found on textiles, furniture, ceramics and jewelry, generally in its more complex ideograph (壽), but also in its simplified (post-1950) form (寿). The ideograph may appear alone or be surrounded by flowers, bats, or other good luck symbols, but will always hold a central position. 

Longevity is commonly recognized as one of the Five Blessings (''wǔfú'' 五福 - longevity, wealth, health, love of virtue, a peaceful death) of Chinese belief&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bartholomew |first=Terese Tse |title=Hidden Meanings in Chinese Art |publisher=Asian Art Museum of San Francisco |page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; that are often depicted in the [[homophone|homophonous]] rendition of five flying [[bat]]s because the word for "[[bat]]" in Chinese (''fú'' 蝠) sounds like the word for [[Fu character|"good fortune" or "happiness"]] or in this case, "blessings".&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomew, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; In this arrangement, the ''shòu'' ideograph sometimes takes the dominant central position, replacing the fifth bat.

Other symbols in Chinese iconography that represent longevity include [[Pine|pine trees]], [[Crane (bird)|cranes]], spotted deer, special collectors' stones (''shòushí'' 寿石), [[peach]]es, and [[tortoise]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Duda, pp. 204-6&lt;/ref&gt; These are often depicted in small groupings to emphasize the central, symbolic meaning of the picture (for example, cranes standing amongst pine trees).  

Perhaps the most common Chinese auspicious saying concerning longevity is that found on scrolls in nearly every Chinese calligraphy shop in the world: ''shòu shān fú hǎi'' (寿山福海), which can be translated as "May your life be as steadfast as the mountains and your good fortune as limitless as the seas".

Since 2017, the version 10 of the [[Unicode]] Standard features a rounded version of the symbol in the "Enclosed Ideographic Supplement" block, at code point U+1F262 (ROUNDED SYMBOL FOR SHOU).&lt;ref name="unicode"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Unicode Standard, Version 10.0, Enclosed Ideographic Supplement|url=https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/Unicode-10.0/U100-1F200.pdf|website=unicode.org|publisher=The Unicode Consortium|accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In names===
As a sign for a resonant cultural concept, the character became a part of many Chinese names (e.g. [[Palace of Tranquil Longevity]] in Beijing). The Japanese equivalent is '''Kotobuki''' 寿 (see [[Nakajima Kotobuki]], [[Tsukasa Kotobuki]]). See also [[Jurōjin]] (Shou Laoren) and [[Fukurokuju]].
