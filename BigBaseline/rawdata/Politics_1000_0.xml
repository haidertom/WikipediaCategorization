{{Populism sidebar}}
{{African American topics sidebar|right}}

Following the collapse of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], [[African American]]s created a broad-based independent political movement in the South: '''Black Populism'''.&lt;ref&gt;Ali 2008, pp. 74–100&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginnings==

Between 1886 and 1898 Black farmers, [[sharecropper]]s, and agrarian laborers organized their communities to combat the rising tide of [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] laws. As Black Populism asserted itself and grew into a regional force, it met fierce resistance from the white planter and business elite that, through the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and its affiliated network of courts, militias, sheriffs, and newspapers, maintained tight control of the region. Violence against Black Populism was organized through the [[Ku Klux Klan]], among other white terrorist organizations designed to halt or reverse the advance of black civil and political rights.&lt;ref&gt;Ali 2010, pp. 113–167.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==

Despite opposition, Black Populists carried out a wide range of activities:

*Establishing farming exchanges
*Raising money for schools
*Publishing newspapers
*Lobbying for better legislation
*Mounting boycotts against agricultural trusts
*Carrying out strikes for better wages
*Protesting the convict-lease system and lynching
*Demanding Black jurors in cases involving black defendants
*Promoting local political reforms and federal supervision of elections
*Running independent and fusion campaigns.

Black Populism found early expression in various agrarian organizations, including the [[Colored Agricultural Wheels]], the southern [[Knights of Labor]], the [[Cooperative Workers of America]], and the [[Colored Farmers' National Alliance and Cooperative Union|Colored Farmers' Alliance]]. However, facing the limitations in attempting to implement their reforms absent of engaging the electoral process, Black Populists helped to launch the [[People's Party (United States)|People’s Party]] and used the then left-of-centre [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in fusion campaigns. (Today though, after the Republican Party moved to the right, and the Democratic Party in the South was abandoned by the White Populist [[Dixiecrats]] who had opposed integration in the 1960s, most African Americans who vote cast ballots for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] candidates).&lt;ref&gt;Ali 2010, pp. 13–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resistance and failure==

By the late 1890s, under relentless attack – propaganda campaigns warning of a “second Reconstruction” and “Negro rule,” physical intimidation, violence, and assassinations of leaders and foot soldiers – the movement was crushed. A key figure in the attack on Black Populism was [[Ben Tillman]], the leader of [[South Carolina]]'s white farmers' movement. As realistic politicians, the Southern Populist knew that they had only two possible alternatives in the fight against the ruling [[Bourbon Democrat]]s. They must choose between trying to win the Negro votes or working to eliminate it entirely. The Tillman group in South Carolina sought the latter method. They were completely reactionary on the Negro question and stood with the Bourbons in disregarding the principles of the Fifteenth Amendment. Elsewhere the populists sought to win Negro votes, either through fusion with the Republican minority or through the raising of issues with a broad appeal to the Negro farmers. It was no accident that in the South the third-party movement was strongest in those states where it sought not only black votes but active black support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Rochester |first=Anna |year=1943 |title=The Populist Movement in the United States |location=New York |publisher=International Publishers |page=59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion that African Americans had somehow betrayed populism would haunt the Georgia People's Party from the very beginning. Populists had realized the political importance of blacks. Of the state's forty thousand Republicans voters, a considerable majority were former bondsmen. If the white votes were to split, they might decide the outcome of any state election. But therein lay a predicament. How were Populists to court the black votes without losing the whites? How were they to keep whites from supporting the "negro party"? An attempt had to be made to win over blacks. It was a risky scheme, but it contained a degree of precedent in state politics. In the 1870s and 1880s, democrats and independents had sometimes used the same device when the white votes splits. In those days many whites were willing to allow African American men the ballot, especially when it could be sometimes bought for so little.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Barton |first=C. Shaw |year=1947 |title=The Wool-Hat Boys – Georgia's Populist Party |publisher=Louisiana State University Press |page=78 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Black populism was destroyed, marking the end of organized political resistance to the return of [[white supremacy]] in the South in the late 19th century. Nevertheless, black populism stood as the largest independent political uprising in the South until the modern [[Civil Rights]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Ali 2005, pp. 6–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1986''' was the ninth [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting|Meeting]] of the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government|Heads of Government]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].  It was held in [[London]], the [[United Kingdom]], between 3 August 1986 and 5 August 1986, and was hosted by that country's [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Margaret Thatcher]]. This was a special meeting held in between the biennial CHOGMs in order to consider the recommendations of the [[Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group]] regarding economic sanctions against South Africa due to its policies of apartheid. British prime minister Margaret Thatcher's refusal to support mandatory sanctions resulted in an acrimonious meeting and almost led to a split in the Commonwealth.

It was founded in the mid-1980s as '''Communist Party of Finland (Unity)''' ({{lang-fi|Suomen Kommunistinen Puolue (yhtenäisyys)}}, SKPy, {{lang-sv|Finlands kommunistiska parti(enhet)}} FKP(e)) by the former opposition of the old [[Communist Party of Finland]] (1918–1992). SKP is not represented in the [[eduskunta|Finnish parliament]], but the party has local councillors in some municipalities, including the city councils of [[Helsinki]] and [[Tampere]]. SKP claims 2,500 members.

The party has been officially registered since 1997. In the 1980s, when the opposition and the organizations it controlled were expelled from the SKP led by [[Arvo Aalto]], the SKPy, however, chose not to register since they considered themselves the real SKP and claimed Aalto had illegally stolen the party. The courts later ruled all the expulsions illegal.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==History==

===The opposition inside SKP===

The internal conflict of Finnish communists began in the mid-1960s, when the party led by the new chairman [[Aarne Saarinen]], began to modernize the party line / outlook. A minority of the party cadre didn't accept this and they accused the SKP leadership of being [[Marxist revisionism|revisionist]]. SKP didn't break up in the 1960s and the party was formally united until the mid-1980s. After the 20th party congress in 1984 things, however, changed as [[Arvo Aalto]] was elected chairman, after which the opposition didn't participate in (or was left out of) the SKP central committee. The opposition, which was also known as “[[taistoism|taistoists]]”, called supporters of Aalto “axe liners”.

===The founding of SKPy===
The central committee of the SKP expelled eight opposition district organizations from the party 13 October 1985. Also, 494 other basic organizations and 17 city or regional organizations were expelled 13 June 1986, which the expelled then dubbed “Black Friday”. The opposition considered the actions to be against the law. They took the conflict to courts and because of minor technicalities Helsingin Hovioikeus court overruled SKP's decision 11 June 1987. SKP then re-expelled these same organizations in its 21st party congress (12–14 June 1987). However, a week before this happened, the newly founded SKP (Unity) held its own “21st” party congress. The ambiguities in the expelling process and the opposition's firm belief in its own cause gave it the justification it needed and they considered SKPy to be the real SKP. They claimed Aalto had illegally seized the party with “paper members”. SKPy was never taken to the official party register of Finland as the party considered that to have been voluntary resignation and admission of SKPy not being the real SKP.

April 26, 1986 a meeting of "the representatives of SKP organizations" was held in [[Tampere]] and those present elected a new central committee. The leader of the new central committee was [[Taisto Sinisalo]], former vice chairman of the SKP and the most well-known figure of the opposition, who already had led ''Committee of SKP Organizations'' founded in November 1985. In the SKPy's 21st party congress Sinisalo was re-elected. [[Yrjö Hakanen]] and [[Marja-Liisa Löyttyjärvi]] became the vice chairmen while the former SKP chairman [[Jouko Kajanoja]] was elected party secretary. In his congress speech, Sinisalo told that the suffix “unity” meant “strong intention to gather all the forces of the SKP”. The congress, however, also was heading to future and building of a new party, or “rebuilding” as they thought it. Before the name SKPy was adopted the party was known in media as the ''unity'' or ''Tiedonantaja group''.

===SKP and the Soviet Union===
SKPy was very committed to the [[Soviet Union]] and the political line of its [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] (CPSU), which was going through great changes during [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]]'s time. SKPy supported [[perestroika]] but criticized those who claimed to have been "Gorbachevist" even before Gorbachev's time. SKPy claimed SKP to be anti-SU and tried to give the Finnish people as positive a picture as possible of that country. When SKP split the monetary support from Soviet Union was halted and, for example, the very profitable publishing deals of the SKP had gone to SKPy. Gorbachev's CPSU, however, had relations with both parties.

===KTP splits from SKPy===
In the late 1970s the opposition of SKP began to split as those supporting a more traditional version of [[Marxism-Leninism]] began to criticize opposition leaders. When it was decided that SKPy would not be registered as an official party, some communists protested and demanded registration. They thought SKPy was clinging to the unity slogan in a situation in which it no longer seemed realistic. In the 1987 party congress, these people were warned by the SKPy leadership but they chose to ignore the advice and oriented themselves toward founding a new party. [[For Peace and Socialism - Communist Workers Party]] (''Kommunistinen Työväenpuolue – Rauhan ja Sosialismin puolesta'', KTP) was founded early in the year 1988. Founders of KTP felt to be securing the existence of a Marxist-Leninist party in Finland while criticizing SKPy for being revisionist and supporting [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. The most famous figure in the new party was probably [[Markus Kainulainen]], a longtime SKP district secretary of [[Uusimaa]] and a former MP.

===The founding of Left Alliance===
[[Esko-Juhani Tennilä]], a member of the [[Parliament of Finland]], was elected new chairman of SKPy 22 October 1989 when Kajanoja decided to resign while strongly criticizing his comrades. Tennilä has later told he took the job to secure that the founding of a new united left party would not be sabotaged by his own party comrades many of which were quite critical of it. The [[Left Alliance (Finland)|Left Alliance]] (''Vasemmistoliitto'') was founded in spring 1990 and members of SKPy and its electoral front Deva also joined even though prejudices were very high on both sides at this point.

===Dispute over double membership===
Members of the [[Left Alliance (Finland)|Left Alliance]] (LA) disliked that many of their members were also members of the SKPy. It was thus decided that SKPy members couldn't participate in the LA's electoral lists, even though they could be members. Because of this, Tennilä also had to quit his job as party chairman when joining LA group in parliament. [[Yrjö Hakanen]] was chosen Tennilä's successor. The dispute over double membership, as it was called, led to many SKPy members leaving LA and relations between the two parties got even colder. On the other hand, many former SKPy members were actively participating in LA.

===The “new” SKP===
In its 1993 party congress (August 28–29) SKPy oriented towards founding a new officially registered communist party and drafting of a new party program. A new party logo was also introduced to mark renewal. It was suggested that a congress to continue SKP's work should be held and that happened next year (November 26–27). In the congress the suffix “unity” was dropped from the name as SKPy now considered to consist of all those comrades who wanted to have an independent communist party. An athletic club was made the basis of new organization and renamed SKP. The decision split the party as some supporters would have preferred SKP to have a lesser role as “Marxist forum” of some kind. Leadership of Left Alliance was also not pleased with those plans. SKP would have wanted to stay inside LA but that wasn't possible and the parties split in the spring of 1994. SKP wasn't however “re-registered” until 1997. There was some confusion, as the new SKP didn't accept responsibility for debts of the old one, which had gone bankrupt.

SKP has a nationwide organization consisting of 14 district organizations. The [[central committee]] has 41 members and the [[politbyro]] 10. The organ of SKP is ''[[Tiedonantaja]]'', which was founded in the 1960s. Tiedonantaja was also the organ of Deva during 1986-1990. The editor-in-chief is [[Marko Korvela]] since 2012. SKP also has some local papers.

As the SKPy considered itself to be the real SKP it also had the same organizational structure. It was based on [[Leninist]] principle of [[democratic centralism]] and the party rules of 1958 (modified in 1978).

===Deva – SKPy's electoral front===
While SKPy was never officially registered, its supporters founded an electoral front [[Democratic Alternative (Finland)|Democratic Alternative]] (''{{lang|fi|Demokraattinen vaihtoehto}}'', Deva). Those MPs of [[Finnish People's Democratic League]] (''{{lang|fi|Suomen kansan demokraattinen liitto}}'', SKDL, a front organization dominated by SKP) who were against expulsions were expelled from SKDL and they found the parliament group of Deva. Deva was SKPy's SKDL and it was supposed to attract some democratic allies. The small [[Socialist Workers Party (Finland)|Socialist Workers Party]] (''{{lang|fi|Sosialistinen työväenpuolue}}'', STP) didn't join Deva but it had members on the DEVA list. Young supporters of SKPy and Deva founded [[Revolutionary Youth League (Finland)|Revolutionary Youth League]] (''{{lang|fi|Vallankumouksellinen nuorisoliitto}}'', VKN) which was Deva's youth organization. SKDL's [[Socialist Student League (Finland)|Socialist Student League]] (''{{lang|fi|Sosialistinen opiskelijaliitto}}'', SOL) also joined. Deva was led by actress [[Kristiina Halkola]].

In [[Finnish parliamentary election, 1987|1987 parliamentary elections]] Deva got 4.3% of votes and four MPs. In [[Finnish presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential elections]] Deva candidate [[Jouko Kajanoja]] got under 2 per cent of the votes. Not even all members of SKPy supported Kajanoja who was the party chairman. Deva was closed down in 1990 after [[Left Alliance (Finland)|Left Alliance]] was founded and most of its members joined the new party.

The SKP participates in [[Elections in Finland#Parliamentary elections|parliamentary]], [[European Parliament elections|European Parliament]] and [[Elections in Finland#Municipal elections|municipal]] elections. The party has not put up candidates in recent [[presidential elections]]. No national representatives has been elected from the SKP lists but the party has a few local councillors. The SKP also participates in trade union and cooperative elections.

The SKP first took part in parliamentary elections in 1999. The party had electoral alliances with small parties of ''Muutos 99'' coalition. It was the first time the Finnish electorate had an opportunity to vote for a list named Communist Party of Finland. In 2003 the vote-puller for the party was rock musician [[Kari Peitsamo]] (1 803 votes) and in 2007 rap artist [[Steen1|Seppo "Steen1" Lampela]] (1 842).

In the local elections the SKP has had elected councillors in about ten different municipalities. The party has got its strongest support in [[Nokia (city)|Nokia]], where there are three SKP councillors. Communists also briefly had three councillors in the [[Jyväskylä]] city council until early 2008.

The SKP has made electoral coalitions with other small parties, especially the Communist Workers Party (KTP). Communist League members were on SKP lists before they in 2006 founded the [[Workers Party of Finland]] (STP). The SKP condemned the STP for scattering communist forces.&lt;ref&gt;KTP:stä erotetut hajottivat Vaihtoehtoväen (Tiedonantaja 22.9.2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The parties have made some limited electoral cooperation since. The Left Alliance has never been interested in coalitions with the communists,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skp.fi/ajankohtaista/110806TA.html Vasemmistoliitto torjui vaaliliitot SKP:n kanssa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927211453/http://www.skp.fi/ajankohtaista/110806TA.html |date=2007-09-27 }} (Tiedonantaja 11.8.2006)&lt;/ref&gt; although the parties have had coalitions in few municipalities.

The former SKP chairman [[Yrjö Hakanen]] is an elected member of [[HOK-Elanto]] cooperative council since 1999. The SKP represented joint list with the KTP.

&lt;!--Article not linked within: {{Marxism}}--&gt;

'''Communization''' (or '''communisation''' in [[British English]]) mainly refers to a contemporary [[communist]] theory in which there is a "mixing-up of [[insurrectionist anarchism]], the [[Left communism|communist ultra-left]], post-[[Autonomism|autonomists]], anti-political currents, groups like [[The Coming Insurrection|the Invisible Committee]], as well as more explicitly ‘communizing’ currents, such as ''Théorie Communiste''. "Obviously at the heart of the word is communism and, as the shift to communization suggests, communism as a particular activity and process..."&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Noys (ed). [http://www.minorcompositions.info/?p=299 ''Communization and its Discontents: Contestation, Critique, and Contemporary Struggles.''] Minor Compositions, [[Autonomedia]]. 2011. 1st ed.&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note the big differences in perception and usage. Some groups start out from an activist voluntarism (''Tiqqun'', ''Invisible Committee''), while others derive communization as an historical and social result emerging out of capital's development over the last decades (''Endnotes'', ''Théorie Communiste''). ''Endnotes'' totally distinguishes itself from the mixing of all sorts of meanings of the word ''communization'' and explicitly refers to the different reception in the Anglophone world as opposed to the original French milieu from which it emerged as a critique.&lt;ref&gt; "It has thus become necessary to make the distinction: the 'communization theory' now spoken of in the English-speaking world is largely an imaginairy entity, an artefact of the Anglophone reception of various unrelated works...For us communization does not signify some general positive process of 'sharing' or 'making common'. It signifies the speficic revolutionairy undoing of the relations of property constitutive of the capitalist class relation. " e.g. [http://www.minorcompositions.info/?p=299 Endnotes "What are we to do?" ]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==

In [[communist]] political theory, communization is the process of abolishing [[ownership]] of the [[means of production]], which, in societies dominated by the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]], are owned by individual capitalists, [[Sovereign state|states]], or other collective bodies. In some versions of communist theory, communization is understood as the transfer of ownership from [[Privately held company|private]] capitalist hands to the collective hands of producers, whether in the form of [[co-operative enterprises]] or [[communes]], or through the mediation of a state or federation of [[workers' councils]] on a local, national, or global scale. In other programs, such as those of some [[left communists]] (e.g. [[Gilles Dauvé]], [[Jacques Camatte]]), [[autonomism|autonomists]] (e.g., [[Mario Tronti]]), and [[libertarian communists]] (e.g. [[Peter Kropotkin]]), communization means the abolition of [[property]] itself along with any state-like institutions claiming to represent a given subset of humanity. In these accounts humanity as a whole, directly or indirectly, would take over the task of the production of goods for use (and not for exchange). People would then have free access to those goods rather than exchanging labor for money, and distribution would take place according to the maxim "[[from each according to his ability, to each according to his need]]."

== History ==

=== Origins and precedents ===
The term communization was not used by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], but it was employed in the above sense by early Marxists.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/morris/works/1887/policy.htm William Morris "The Policy of Abstention"] (1887)  and  [http://www.marxists.org/archive/bax/1888/06/impera.htm E. Belfort Bax "Et Impera"] (1888)&lt;/ref&gt; Communization in this sense is equivalent to the establishment of the "higher phase" of communist society described by Marx in ''[[Critique of the Gotha Program]]''. In ''[[State and Revolution]]'', [[Vladimir Lenin]] referred to the lower phase, organized around the principle "[[To each according to his contribution]]", as "socialism", with the higher phase as "complete communism", or "full communism", as [[Joseph Stalin]] would later put it. Thus both Lenin and Stalin gave grounds for thinking of communization not as a transition from capitalism to communism, but as a transition from socialism to communism, a transition that would take place after the working class had seized power, and which may last a long time (in the 1930s Stalin conceived of "full communism" as still a long way off&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Stalin’s “Economic Problems of Socialism of the U.S.S.R.” (1939)&lt;/ref&gt;). Thus the interval between the two transitions came to be seen as a necessary "period of transition" between the workers' revolution and communism.

It appears that within so-called "communist" regimes the demand for "communization" was associated with an impatience with the "period of transition" and a desire to break with the remaining capitalist forms (e.g., money, wage labor) still in place in those regimes.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. some [[Chinese Ultra-Left]] tendencies during the so-called "[[Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution]]."&lt;/ref&gt; Those pushing for a move toward "communizing" in this sense were typically denounced as "[[ultra-left]]", with their suggestions dismissed as impractical and [[utopian]], but they were able to point to the historical examples of the [[Paris Commune]] and the [[Glorious Revolution (Spain)|Spanish Revolution]], where more radical measures of popular collectivization had been taken than in the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian]] and [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese]] revolutions, as well as to the [[German Revolution of 1918–19]] and the [[Biennio Rosso|Italian councils movement of 1919-1920]] in which the historic "[[left communist]]" tendencies had been formed.

=== Late 20th century ===
The association of the term communization with a self-identified "[[ultra-left]]" was cemented in France in the 1970s, where it came to describe not a transition to a higher phase of communism but a vision of communist revolution itself. Thus the 1975 Pamphlet ''A World Without Money'' states: “insurrection and communisation are intimately linked.  There would not be first a period of insurrection and then later, thanks to this insurrection, the transformation of social reality.  The insurrectional process derives its force from communisation itself.” This vision was opposed to the [[statism]] and [[vanguardism]] of the [[Leninist]] conception of revolution, but it also identified the perceived failure of the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian]] and [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese]] revolutions (carried out on the Leninist politico-military model) with the insufficiency of measures taken to abolish capitalist social relations (e.g. lack of direct collectivization, persistence of monetary relations). It also reversed the supposed "pragmatism" of the Leninist focus on the state, arguing that the final goal of the "[[withering away of the state]]" could hardly be advanced by the seizure of state power and the establishment of a "revolutionary" bureaucracy, but that the most practical means to achieve this goal would rather be the abolition of the capitalist relations (money, capital, wages) on which state power depends. Thus La Banquise writes:
{{quote|"one can foresee that a movement of communisation that destroys the State, undermines the social base of the enemy, and spreads under the effect of the irresistible appeal arousing the birth of new social relations between men, will bond together the revolutionary camp far better than any power which, while waiting to conquer the world before communising it, would behave no differently than... a State."&lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/the-story-of-our-origins-la-banquise "The Story of Our Origins"]''La Banquise'' No. 2 (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Within this 1970s French tendency "communization" thus came to represent the absence of a period of transition and a conception of revolution as the application of communist measures throughout the economy and society.&lt;ref&gt;For an historical account see: Endnotes [http://endnotes.org.uk/articles/8 "Bring Out Your Dead"], Endnotes no. 1 (2008). Although they do not use the term a very similar conception can be found in the early works of [[Antonio Negri]], e.g. the chapter ‘Communism and Transition’ in his ''Marx Beyond Marx'' (1978), as well as in the 1980s works of the insurrectionist anarchist [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]].&lt;/ref&gt; The term is still used in this sense in France today and has spread into English usage as a result of the translation of texts by [[Gilles Dauvé]] and ''Théorie Comuniste'', two key figures in this tendency.

In collaboration with other left communists such as [[François Martin (political theorist)|François Martin]] and [[Karl Nesic]], Dauvé has attempted to fuse, critique, and develop different left communist currents, most notably the Italian movement associated with [[Amadeo Bordiga]] (and its heretical journal ''[[Invariance (journal)|Invariance]]''), German-Dutch [[council communism]], and the French perspectives associated with ''[[Socialisme ou Barbarie]]'' and the [[Situationist International]].&lt;ref&gt;"The text surveys the Italian and German lefts, Socialisme Ou Barbarie and the Situationist International and describes the theoretical development of the French ultra-left."[http://libcom.org/library/re-collecting-our-past-la-banquise Re-collecting our past - La Banquise]&lt;/ref&gt; He has focused on theoretical discussions of economic issues concerning the controversial failure of [[Second International]] [[Marxism]] (including both [[Social Democracy]] and [[Leninist]] "Communism"), the global revolutionary upsurge of the 1960s and its subsequent dissolution, and on developments in global [[capitalist accumulation]] and [[class struggle]].

=== Early 21st century ===
In the late 1990s a close but not identical sense of "communization" was developed by the French post-situationist group [[Tiqqun]]. In keeping with their ultra-left predecessors, Tiqqun's predilection for the term seems to be its emphasis on communism as an immediate process rather than a far-off goal, but for Tiqqun it is no longer synonymous with "the revolution" considered as an historical event, but rather becomes identifiable with all sorts of activities – from squatting and setting up communes to simply "sharing" – that would typically be understood as "pre-revolutionary".&lt;ref&gt;"As we apprehend it, the process of instituting communism can only take the form of a collection of acts of ''communisation'', of making common such-and-such space, such-and-such machine, such-and-such knowledge. That is to say, the elaboration of the mode of sharing that attaches to them. Insurrection itself is just an accelerator, a decisive moment in this process." Anonymous, [http://www.bloom0101.org/call.pdf ''Call''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721212804/http://www.bloom0101.org/call.pdf |date=July 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From an ultra-left perspective such a politics of "dropping-out" or, as Tiqqun put it, "desertion" — setting up spaces and practices that are held to be partially autonomous from capitalism — is typically dismissed as either naive or reactionary.&lt;ref&gt;For a critique of Tiqqun from an ultra-left perspective, as well as a description of the opposition between the two sense of "communization" see "[http://libcom.org/library/reflexions-around-call Reflexions Around Call] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912181348/http://libcom.org/library/reflexions-around-call |date=September 12, 2011 }}" Letters Journal #3. See also Dauvé and Nesic, [http://troploin0.free.fr/ii/index.php/textes/19-communisation-un-appel-et-une-invite "Un Appel et une Invite"].&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the popularity of the Tiqqun-related works ''Call'' and ''[[The Coming Insurrection]]'' in US [[anarchist]] circles it tended to be this latter sense of "communization" that was employed in US anarchist and "[[insurrectionist]]" communiques, notably within the [[2009 California college tuition hike protests|Californian student movement of 2009-2010]].&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [http://afterthefallcommuniques.info/ "After the Fall: Communiqués from Occupied California"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110126222020/http://afterthefallcommuniques.info/ |date=January 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "More recently its ideas have been elaborated and extended in discussions with like-minded groups including the English language ''Endnotes'' and the Swedish journal ''Riff Raff''.

{{Accounting}}

A '''Comprehensive Annual Financial Report''' (CAFR) is a set of U.S. [[government financial statements]] comprising the financial report of a state, municipal or other governmental entity that complies with the accounting requirements promulgated by the [[Governmental Accounting Standards Board]] (GASB).  GASB provides standards for the content of a CAFR in its annually updated publication ''Codification of Governmental Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Earl|title=Accounting for Governmental &amp; Nonprofit Entities|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Irwin|location=Page 13|isbn=0073379603|edition=15th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Federal Government adheres to standards determined by the [[Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board]] (FASAB).

A CAFR is compiled by a state, municipal or other governmental accounting staff and audited by an external [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (AICPA) certified accounting firm utilizing GASB requirements. It is composed of three sections: Introductory, Financial and Statistical.&lt;ref&gt;2005 Governmental Accounting, Auditing, and Financial Reporting, page 151&lt;/ref&gt; It combines the financial information of [[fund accounting]] and [[Government-sponsored enterprise|Enterprise Authorities]] accounting.

==History==
The National Committee on Municipal Accounting (NCMA) was formed in 1934 by the [[Government Financial Officers Association]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gfoa.org/  Government Financial Officers Association] Web Site&lt;/ref&gt; to create accounting standards. As a result of its work, the 'Principles of Municipal Accounting', the predecessor to the CAFR, was created. The successor to the NCMA, the National Council on Governmental Accounting (NCGA), issued 'Governmental Accounting, Auditing and Financial Reporting', which is the basis of the format for the current standard. This document, known as the "Blue Book", and its successors documented the CAFR accounting structure and provided standardization and example documents. By 1946, the various [[Political divisions of the United States|levels of government]]—federal, state, local and municipal—each began producing a CAFR to catalog an accurate picture of institutional funds, enterprise or financial holdings, assets and [[Fixed income|total investment incomes]] for those government and nongovernmental entities using the report. This measure is above and beyond the budget process and replaced what was regularly an "off-the-books" practice called the "general [[Fixed asset|fixed-asset]] account group". General Purpose government "budget" reports did not reflect accounting of this financial data, only reporting on the budget or "rainy day" funds or pension fund investments. By the 1970s, the CAFR became the nationwide paradigm for local government accounting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/business-finance-encyclopedia/government-financial-reporting  "Government Financial Reporting."] Encyclopedia of Business and Finance. Ed. Allison McClintic Marion. Gale Cengage, 2001. eNotes.com. 2006. 18 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting CAFR is presented to the GFOA, which conducts each year a review of applicant local government CAFRs and upon review awards their Certificate of Achievement Award for Excellence in Financial Reporting to those local governments that are in compliance with their CAFR accounting standards of preparation. Presently, accounting principles for government entities are set by transmittal letters issued to local governments by the GASB.

==Differences between a general budget and a CAFR==
The primary difference between a budget and a CAFR is a budget is a plan for a specific fiscal period (often a year) primarily showing where tax income is to be allocated. The CAFR contains the results of the period (year) with previous years accumulations. A CAFR shows the total of all financial accounting that a general purpose budget reports does not. The CAFR contains a section that provides a comparison of period budget and actual. Additionally, the CAFR gives a detailed showing of investment accounts by category reflecting balances over previous years, or in plain language using a personal example in comparison would be the difference between: Your house Budget for the year vs your statement of "Net Worth" covering the financial accounting over your lifetime. 1-year vs your lifetime.

A Government budget document is a blueprint for a "specific grouping" of government agencies' spending over the course of an annual financial period. General Purpose Budgets contain both the spending categories of specified units of government, such as school districts, social services, transportation, courts, police, fire, and park services; along with estimates of revenues expected to occur during the year, such as investment return; due from other funds, overrides of money from the previous year, and tax payments. They are usually more limited to the expected costs of running the aforementioned [[government operations]] through tax income as opposed to describing the status of any government fixed assets and investment wealth.

A CAFR is a report of the complete overall financial results not just for the year but what has accumulated since the inception of that local government of both those "specific groupings" of government agencies that appear in the current fiscal year General Purpose Budget and all other agencies and departments. These can be autonomous, enterprise (for example government or city owned golf courses), recycling, water, sewer, and financial management - often these agencies were created with the inception of that local, state or government. The CAFR provides information about all of these other government agencies that may have their own budgets and separate investment accounts but their financial holdings are ''not'' combined with the general purpose '''budget''' that the same government presents to the public. The CAFR, or as it is called in CANADA CanFR can be used along with a budget document to compare the organizations total financial standing to the annual general purpose budget. The CAFR is the complete showing of the financial investment and income records from all sources, that reflects what has developed over decades whereas a budget report is an inferior document to the CAFR being that it is primarily focused on what revenue is expected to be brought in and spent for just the year.

In contrast with the rules applying to governments, publicly traded US companies are required by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC), to provide their Annual Financial Report (AFR) to every shareholder each year. Government's accounting falls under GAP (Generally Accepted Procedures)overseen by GASB.org for government accounting. US Companies have their own standards of accounting which would not be accepted by the SEC if US Companies attempted to use local Government's GAP accounting. To view the GASB.org accounting changes in local government CAFR GAP accounting, a short version of each change going back to 1984 can be viewed here - &lt;ref&gt;[http://gasb.org/cs/ContentServer?c=Page&amp;pagename=GASB%2FPage%2FGASBSectionPage&amp;cid=1176156669308 GFOA CAFR ACCOUNTING CHANGES]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media Coverage &amp; Misconceptions ==


News stories covering financial issues of government cite "rainy day funds" or special "ear marked" funds, loans between government entities, sales of government holdings in, for example, shares of a health care insurance company, self insurance management funds, debt repayment funds that can be up to 40% of the debt itself, and then the "budget" is often referred to, along with mentions of pension funds investments, but the full accounting of assets of government entities, the "CAFR" is typically not mentioned.{{Citation needed|reason=Which news stories are these? Need some examples.|date=September 2017}}

"Alternative" media, since the late 1990s, has exposed segments of the public to the subject of the (U.S.) CAFR contributing to the topic being labeled as "conspiracy theory" or "soap box" issue. {{Citation needed|reason=Which alternative media are we talking about here? Who is labeling these things "conspiracy theory" or "soap box"?|date=September 2017}} In all reality, local government's "Net Worth" accounting document, the CAFR is a mandatory review document for any responsible taxpaying citizen.

Reporting on government financial issues can be seen as sensationalized in dealing with alleged excesses in spending or tucked away wealth held not clearly visible in the budgetary accounting. A $10,000 dollar Christmas tree for example, or vague mentions of "many billions" in referring to issues around the road improvement, self-insurance, debt repayment, and pension funds managed by a state. {{Citation needed|reason=Which news stories are these? Need some examples.|date=September 2017}}

The State of TX based on good due diligence to its residents publishes a "Cash Report" that lists all funds managed by the state. [http://www.texastransparency.org/State_Finance/Budget_Finance/Reports/Cash_Report/14/texas_annual_cash_report_2014.pdf The 2014 TX Cash Report] can be viewed here - &lt;ref&gt;http://www.texastransparency.org/State_Finance/Budget_Finance/Reports/Cash_Report/14/texas_annual_cash_report_2014.pdf where several thousand separate funds managed by the State of TX can be viewed.&lt;/ref&gt;  In one recent series of reports, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100131020023/http://www.kaco.org/Home.htm Kentucky Association of Counties] whose spending came under scrutiny by the [[Lexington Herald-Leader]] provided some awareness of these types of entities as well as their surpluses and the claimed spending excesses while using money acquired from government fees for products like municipal insurance at premium rates, which build surpluses beyond the needs of the entity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kentucky.com/2010/04/13/1222627/attorney-general-investigating.html Attorney general investigating KLC]&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical topics of the alternative media may include examples of: government entities financing each other's bond issues; Orange County California's or other divisions of government investments in derivatives; financial deals that are kept from the public to entice businesses to locate in a state, which may include tax incentives in exchange for stock assets in a company. {{Citation needed|reason=Which news stories are these? Need some examples.|date=September 2017}}
 
Much of both the mainstream and alternative media coverage of the topic of government financial issues must be considered a factor in public's confidence towards issues of government [[accountability]].

Discipline "cannot be identified with any one institution or apparatus," [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze]] explains, "precisely because it is a type of [[Power (philosophy)|power]], a technology, that traverses every kind of apparatus or institution, linking them, prolonging them, and making them converge and function in a new way."&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze (1986, 26).&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept may be related to the concept of "[[total institution]]" proposed by [[Erving Goffman]] in 1961, as well as to [[Louis Althusser]]'s [[Ideological State Apparatus]]es (ISA).

'''Expansionist nationalism''' is an aggressive and radical form of [[nationalism]] that incorporates autonomous, patriotic sentiments with a belief in [[expansionism]]. The term was coined during the late nineteenth century as European powers indulged in the '[[Scramble for Africa]]' in the name of national glory, but has been most associated with militarist governments during the 20th century including [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist_regime_.281922.E2.80.931943.29|Fascist Italy]], [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Japanese empire]], and the [[Balkans]] countries of [[Albanian nationalism|Albania]] ([[Greater Albania]]), [[Bulgarian nationalism|Bulgaria]] ([[Greater Bulgaria]]), [[Croatian nationalism|Croatia]] ([[Greater Croatia]]), [[Hungarian nationalism|Hungary]] ([[Hungarian irredentism|Greater Hungary]]), [[Romanian nationalism|Romania]] ([[Greater Romania]]) and [[Serbian nationalism|Serbia]] ([[Greater Serbia]]).

== Ideology ==
What distinguishes expansionist nationalism from [[liberal nationalism]] is its acceptance of [[chauvinism]], a belief in superiority or dominance. Nations are thus not thought to be equal to their right to self-determination; rather some nations are believed to possess characteristics or qualities that make them superior to others. Expansionist nationalism therefore asserts the state's right to increase its borders at the expense of its neighbours.

The expulsion of the Jews from [[Sicily]] began in 1493 when the [[Spanish Inquisition]] reached the island of [[Sicily]] and its population of more than 30,000 Jews.

==History of the Jews of Sicily and the Spanish Inquisition==
===History of the Sicilian Jews===
{{main|History of the Jews in Sicily}}
At the time of expulsion from Sicily, the Jewish community in Sicily dated back to early [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times, and they were relatively untroubled on the island until the acceptance of the [[Crown of Aragon]] in Sicily in 1412. A great number of Jews had reached Sicily after [[Pompey]]'s 63 BC sacking of [[Jerusalem]].

After the enslavement under Roman rule, Jews in Sicily eventually assimilated into society, working in professions such as philosophy, medicine, artisanal pursuits, and farming.

The exact number of Jews in Sicily at the time of expulsion is not certain, However, some have put the number of Jewish refugees at 36,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gulnbla.tripod.com/main.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, in 1492, it is known the Jewish populations of [[Palermo]], [[Messina]], and several other cities were considerable, and that there were ''[[La Giudecca|Giudeccas]]'', or Jewish settlements, in over 50 places in Sicily, ranging in anywhere population from 350 to 5,000. At their height, Jewish Sicilians probably constituted from five to eight percent of the island's population.[http://www.bestofsicily.com/religion.htm]

===History of the Spanish Inquisition and Jewish Expulsion===
[[Image:Aragonese Empire.PNG|thumb|left|250px|The maximum extent of the Crown of Aragon, including Sicily.]]
Muslims had ruled much of the Iberian Peninsula since the first invasion in 711. By the late Middle Ages, Christian kings had begun to wage war on the Moors and recapture some of the peninsula. After the marriage of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] to Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]], the Moors were finally forced out of Granada in 1492, completing the so-called [[Reconquista]] of the Iberian Peninsula.

In 1479 Sicily and [[Malta]] came under [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]]ese rule. In 1492, as part of an attempt to maintain Catholic orthodoxy and purify their kingdom of Moorish influence, [[Ferdinand and Isabella]] ordered the forced [[Alhambra decree|expulsion]] or conversion of all Jews on pain of death. The date of the expulsion was extended from 18 September 1492 to 12 January 1493, in order to allow the extortion of opportunist tax levies. 

Many Sicilian Jews fled to the neighboring mainland of [[Calabria]], where the [[Spanish Inquisition]]&lt;sup&gt;It wasn't the Inquisition.&lt;/sup&gt; caught up with them again fifty years later.{{cn|date=September 2018}} Not all of the Sicilian Jews departed. A small number of Sicily's Jewish community converted to Catholicism and remained on the island. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.michaelfreund.org/10311/jewish-sicily&lt;/ref&gt;

The great part of the Sicilian Jewish community fled to the [[Ottoman Empire]], especially to what is since the twentieth century [[Greece]], [[Cyprus]] and Turkey. They were well received there. The settlements of these Jews were in Greece and Turkey were large enough great to build their own congregations and to print books.&lt;ref&gt;"Chronika" Vol. 57, Periodical of the Central Board of Jewish Communities in Greece, Athens March 1983, Greek transl. from Goldschmidt, D. In "Sefunot" Vol. 13, Jerusalem, Ben Zvi Institute 1971-1978 (Hebrew) „Prayerbooks of the Jews of Greece“.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nosek, B. Italian and Sicilian Piyyut in contemporary Context and its unique Contribution to further poetical Output Bedřich Nosek, CSc. Mgr. Sylva Ondrejičková Praha, 2011 (Czech)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jews have never returned en masse to Sicily. However, in 2005, for the first time since the Expulsion, a [[Passover seder]] was conducted in Sicily (in Palermo), held by the [[Milan]]ese progressive [[Rabbi]].

[[File:FEMEN Swine Flu Panic Protest-13.jpg|thumb|left|Femen protest in [[Kiev]], 9 November 2009. Early protests were provocative but not topless.]]

[[Anna Hutsol]] is credited as having founded the Femen movement on 10 April 2008, after she became aware of stories of [[Ukrainian woman|Ukrainian women]] duped into going abroad and then taken advantage of sexually.&lt;ref name=History&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/29898/ Feminine Femen targets 'sexpats'], ''[[Kyiv Post]]'' (22 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=F24&gt;[http://observers.france24.com/en/content/20090828-how-they-protest-prostitution-ukraine-femen-sex-tourism How they protest prostitution in Ukraine], [[France 24]] (28 August 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the 2013 documentary by Kitty Green, ''[[Ukraine Is Not a Brothel]]'', Femen was founded by [[Viktor Sviatsky]]. In September 2013 [[Inna Shevchenko]] responded to the documentary stating that Sviatsky "did lead the movement some time ago. ...We accepted this because we did not know how to resist and fight it. ...This is when I decided to leave Ukraine for France to build a new Femen".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/the-man-who-made-femen-new-film-outs-victor-svyatski-as-the-mastermind-behind-the-protest-group-and-its-breastbaring-stunts-8797042.html "The man who made Femen: New film outs Victor Svyatski as the mastermind behind the protest group and its breast-baring stunts"], ''[[The Independent]]''. 3 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=InnaSviatsky&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/05/victory-svyatski-femen-man "Femen let Victor Svyatski take over because we didn't know how to fight it"], ''[[The Guardian]]''. 5 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Femen member Inna Shevchenko discussed Sviatsky with ''[[The Independent]]'' in January, 2014, and, while not using the word 'founder' said: "I will never deny that he is a smart person. He was the reason why we knew each other. He was one of those smart people around us at the beginning, who were more experienced".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Geoffrey | last = McNabb | title = 'I don't want to be liked': Inna Shevchenko, leader of women's rights group Femen, talks dictators, documentaries and death threats | date = 17 January 2014 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/i-dont-want-to-be-liked-inna-shevchenko-leader-of-womens-rights-group-femen-talks-dictators-documentaries-and-death-threats-9062734.html | work = The Independent | accessdate = 2014-01-19 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2013 Femen has been led by [[Inna Shevchenko]]. 

Initially, Femen gained attention by demonstrating in skimpy or erotic clothing. For example, on 21 September 2008 in front of the Turkish embassy,{{where?|date=April 2014}} a dozen Femen members were dressed as nurses with smudged makeup and high pink heels; however, at the 24 August 2009 demonstration on Ukrainian independence day, [[Oksana Shachko]] went topless.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.parismatch.com/Actu-Match/Monde/Actu/Femen-Les-feministes-venues-du-froid-377710/ Femen Les féministes venues du froid] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130110061537/http://www.parismatch.com/Actu-Match/Monde/Actu/Femen-Les-feministes-venues-du-froid-377710/# |date=10 January 2013 }}, ''[[Paris Match]]'' (18 February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Since this approach obtained such great publicity, it rapidly became FEMEN's signature approach.

The signs read "The War Begins Today" and "Stop Raping the Country."]]

Since May 2011, a host of international news outlets have started to report about the organization's actions; this has sharply heightened FEMEN's international profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2011/05/unorthodox_protest_ukraine|title=Unorthodox protest in Ukraine: Indecent exposure |publisher=The Economist |date=20 May 2011|accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Benjamin|last=Bidder|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/Kyiv-s-topless-protestors-the-entire-ukraine-is-a-brothel-a-760697.html |title=Kyiv's Topless Protestors: 'The Entire Ukraine Is a Brothel'|work=Spiegel Online |date=5 May 2011|accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, a branch of Femen launched in the United States of America, based in Seattle, Washington and led by Jordan Robson.

==Amina Tyler case==
[[File:Amina Tyler.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|[[Amina Tyler|Amina "Tyler" Sboui]]]]
{{Main article|Amina Tyler}}
'''Amina Tyler''' (real name Amina Sboui), a [[Tunisia]]n Femen activist, was arrested on 19 May 2013 in [[Tunis]]. International protests followed for her release from detention. On 12 June 2013 a Tunisian judge convicted two French Femen members and one German Femen member after they were charged with public indecency while protesting for the release of Tyler.&lt;ref name=BBCTunis/&gt; Pauline Hillier, Marguerite Stern and [[Josephine Markmann]] were released on 26 June 2013 after a Tunisian court lifted their prison sentence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/27/femen-activists-tunisia-retract-apology Femen activists jailed in Tunisia retract apology], [[The Guardian]] (27 June 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Femen had staged protests in front of the [[Grand Mosque of Paris]] burning a [[Tawhid]] flag. Amina upon release in August 2013 from detention in a Tunisian jail declared she was leaving the group in protest adding that she thought FEMEN's actions in Paris were disrespectful to the [[Muslim world]] and because she saw a lack of financial transparency in the organization.&lt;ref name=vocaAT&gt;https://www.vocativ.com/08-2013/topless-tunisian-teen-activist-dumps-femen-but-still-takes-naked-selfies/&lt;br/&gt; {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823023204/https://www.vocativ.com/08-2013/topless-tunisian-teen-activist-dumps-femen-but-still-takes-naked-selfies/ |date=23 August 2013 }}[http://www.france24.com/en/20130820-jailed-tunisia-activist-amina-leaves-islamophobic-femen-organisation Tunisia's Amina quits ‘Islamophobic’ Femen], [[France 24]] (20 August 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4096">A '''governance failure''' refers to any [[failure]]s of [[governance]] or ineffectiveness of governance processes.&lt;ref name=Newman&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newman|first1=Joshua|title=Governing Public-Private Partnerships|date=2017|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=9780773550018|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pc8mDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT39|accessdate=6 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== General ==
Jessop argues for conceiving governance as a provider of flexibility for decision-making structures opposed to rigid state bureaucracy or market laws. From this approach failures would equate to failures of the governance structure.&lt;ref name=Newman/&gt; According to him new constellations of governance may compensate for state failure.&lt;ref name=Peters/&gt;

Peters and Pierre state that it is the continuous task of government to adapt to growing complexity.&lt;ref name=Peters&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peters|first1=B. Guy|last2=Pierre|first2=Jon|title=Comparative Governance: Rediscovering the Functional Dimension of Governing|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781316738177|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TFblDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12|accessdate=6 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dixon and Dogan write that constructive governance discourses are creative opportunities for people with disparate governance perspectives to find solutions to threatening governance failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dixon|first1=John|last2=Dogan|first2=Rhys|title=Hierarchies, Networks and Markets: Responses to Societal Governance Failure|journal=Administrative Theory &amp; Praxis|date=1 May 2002|volume=24|issue=1|pages=175–196|doi=10.1080/10841806.2002.11029344|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10841806.2002.11029344|accessdate=12 July 2017|issn=1084-1806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policy failure ==
Governance failure may also refer to what can also be described as '''policy failures''' − the effectiveness, efficiency, and resilience of specific [[policies]].&lt;ref name=Newman/&gt; A frequently mentioned example of a policy failure is the [[War on Drugs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=End the Drug War|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/03/20/end-the-drug-war/|publisher=Foreign Policy|accessdate=12 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Friesendorf|first1=Cornelius|title=US Foreign Policy and the War on Drugs: Displacing the Cocaine and Heroin Industry|date=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134123940|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vxx9AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19|accessdate=12 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peter|first1=Andreas,|title=A Tale of Two Borders: The U.S.-Mexico and U.S.-Canada Lines After 9/11|journal=Center for Comparative Immigration Studies|date=22 June 2003|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6d09j0n2|accessdate=12 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RONALD  REAGAN’S  WAR  ON  DRUGS:  A POLICY FAILURE BUT A POLITICAL SUCCESS|url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/21802/Ronald%20Reagan's%20War%20on%20Drugs-A%20Policy%20Failure%20But%20a%20Political%20Success.pdf|accessdate=12 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bagley|first1=Bruce Michael|title=US Foreign Policy and the War on Drugs: Analysis of a Policy Failure|journal=Journal of Interamerican Studies and World Affairs|date=1988|volume=30|issue=2/3|pages=189–212|doi=10.2307/165986|jstor=165986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15253">The '''Hamas–UNRWA Holocaust dispute''' erupted on  31 August 2009 following a perception in the [[Gaza Strip]] that the [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency]] (UNRWA) planned to include a course on human rights that speaks about the [[Holocaust]] in the eighth-grade curriculum of preparatory schools it runs in the territory. Militant Islamic movement [[Hamas]], which controls the [[Gaza Strip]], protested, calling the Holocaust "a lie made up by the [[Zionist]]s" and demanding the removal of the offending content from the curriculum. Some officials of the United Nations agency initially responded by denying that it teaches the subject of the Holocaust in its schools or that it plans to teach it in its new curriculum.&lt;ref name=argue&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-08/31/content_11973740.htm | title=Hamas, UNRWA argue over "Holocaust" lessons in Gaza | publisher=[[Xinhua News]] |location=Gaza| date=August 31, 2009 | accessdate=January 19, 2018 | author=Saud Ramadan, Emad Drinly| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314231647/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-08/31/content_11973740.htm| archivedate=March 14, 2017 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=caught&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.newsday.com/news/world/un-caught-in-gaza-dispute-over-study-of-holocaust-1.1430963 | title=UN caught in Gaza dispute over study of Holocaust | work=[[Newsday]] | date=September 8, 2009 | accessdate=January 19, 2018 | author=Laub, Karin | agency=[[Associated Press]] | location=Gaza City, Gaza Strip}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=slams&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/newsMaps/idUSTRE57T1JW20090830 | title=Hamas slams UN over "Holocaust classes" in Gaza | publisher=[[Reuters]] | date=August 31, 2009 | accessdate=January 19, 2018 | author=Nidal al-Mughrabi}}&lt;/ref&gt; This denial drew criticism from various groups and individuals.

==Background==
UNRWA runs 221 of more than 600 primary and secondary schools in the Gaza Strip, educating some 200,000 children between the ages of 6 and 15.&lt;ref name=argue/&gt; The Gaza Strip has been ruled by Hamas since it seized control of the enclave in June 2007 by defeating Palestinian President [[Mahmoud Abbas]]' security forces. According to the Associated Press, "Hamas has been trying to cement control over Gaza, while the U.N. agency is increasingly emerging as a shadow government, providing services to some 1 million of Gaza's 1.4 million people".&lt;ref name=caught/&gt;

The Holocaust is not taught in U.N.-run schools for Palestinian refugees in the West Bank, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon, nor is it taught in Palestinian government schools in the West Bank or Gaza.&lt;ref name=caught/&gt; There is also no evidence that it was taught in Palestinian schools when these were under Israeli control between 1967 and 1994.

==Hamas protest==
Protesting what it said were plans to teach eighth-graders in U.N. schools about the Holocaust, the Hamas-affiliated [[Popular Committee of Palestinian refugees]] sent an open letter to the chief of UNRWA offices calling the Holocaust "a lie made up by the Zionists" and demanding it "immediately" erase the part that speaks about the Holocaust from the Palestinian pupils' curriculum. Husam Ahmed, the Popular Committee's coordinator in the Gaza Strip, said the material, which was to be included in a course on [[human rights]], "was formed in a way that shows sympathy with the Jews".&lt;ref name=argue/&gt;

The interior ministry of the Hamas de facto government in Gaza expressed astonishment over the UNRWA curriculum's acknowledgement of the Holocaust." "We reject teaching our pupils such thoughts that contradicts with our Palestinian beliefs," said the interior ministry statement, which called on the ministry of education "to check if such news is right."&lt;ref name=caught/&gt;

The head of Hamas' education committee in Gaza, [[Abdul Rahman el-Jamal]], said that the Holocaust was a "big lie".&lt;ref name=condemns&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8230483.stm Hamas condemns Holocaust lessons], BBC News 31-08-2009&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Hamas Education Minister Muhammad Askol criticized UNRWA, saying it was not respecting Hamas's "sovereignty" over Gaza. He said he planned to ask for a meeting with agency officials to "assure the necessary coordination".&lt;ref name=objects/&gt;

Hamas spiritual leader [[Yunis al-Astal]] said teaching children about the Nazi genocide of Jews would be "marketing a lie", and characterized the possible introduction of the subject into Gaza schools as a "war crime".&lt;ref name=objects&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/01/AR2009090102496.html?hpid=sec-world | title=Hamas Objects to Possible Lessons on Holocaust in U.N.-Run Schools in Gaza | work=[[Washington Post]] September 2, 2009| accessdate=January 19, 2018 | author=Schneider, Howard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamas spokesman [[Sami Abu Zuhri]] said that Hamas rejects any attempt to introduce the Holocaust into the curriculum as "a kind of normalization with Israel and an attempt to bridge the psychological gap between Israel and the Palestinians".&lt;ref name=caught/&gt;

[[Jamila al-Shanti]], a Hamas [[Palestinian Legislative Council|legislative official]], said: "Talk about the Holocaust and the execution of the Jews contradicts and is against our culture, our principles, our traditions, values, heritage and religion".&lt;ref name=objects/&gt;

Mustafa al-Sawwaf, editor of the Hamas-run newspaper [[Filastin (newspaper)|Filastin]], said the U.N. "should also be prevented from implementing this destructive policy that harms our history and civilization as well as our people's culture."&lt;ref name=learn&gt;{{cite web | url=http://washingtontimes.com/news/2009/sep/08/hamas-and-the-holocaust/ | title=EDITORIAL: Hamas and the Holocaust | work=Washington Times | date=September 8, 2009 | accessdate=January 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UNRWA response==
UNRWA denied that it teaches the Holocaust in preparatory schools or that the Holocaust is included in the pupils' curriculum. Adnan Abu Hasna, UNRWA spokesman in Gaza, said: "Such reports are totally untrue. The current curriculum that is taught to pupils at UNRWA schools doesn't contain any indication to the subject of the Holocaust".&lt;ref name=argue/&gt;

Similarly, according to the [[Ma'an News Agency]], UNRWA Commissioner-General [[Karen Abu Zayd]] said at a press conference on 1 September, "I can refute allegations that UN school curriculum includes anything about the Holocaust. Anyone can have a look at the school books. Really we focus on human rights in [the] curriculum."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=222848 UNRWA chief: Gaza school curriculum does not include Holocaust], [[Ma'an News Agency]] 01-09-2009&lt;/ref&gt; The accuracy of this report was later contested by UNRWA.

The agency also denied that it was planning to include the subject in its new curriculum. Mahmoud al-Hemdeyat, director of education department of UNRWA in the Gaza Strip, said: "UNRWA hasn't finished yet from finalizing the new curriculum... As far as I know, the curriculum doesn't include anything about the Holocaust".&lt;ref name=argue/&gt;

According to the [[Associated Press]] (AP), Karen Abu Zayd suggested information about the Holocaust could be included in later years, but the curriculum being developed was still in draft stage. AP also wrote that UNWRA's website mentioned general plans to include the Holocaust in lessons on the "historical context" that gave rise to the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=caught/&gt;
 
UNRWA chief in Gaza [[John Ging]] said he believed the dispute over the syllabus had more to do with attempts by Hamas to meddle in the U.N. organization's affairs than with the Holocaust. Ging added that he felt any human rights course is incomplete without discussing the Holocaust, but it would exceed UNWRA's mandate to write texts about the Holocaust and the Palestinian uprooting. According to one UN source, the lessons had been under consideration for the 2009-10 human rights course.&lt;ref name=caught/&gt;

===Disputed quotes===
A statement by UNRWA on 4 September denied unspecified quotes which it said the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] had attributed to Karen Abu Zayd and John Ging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unrwa.org/etemplate.php?id=434 Statement by UNRWA on Holocaust Education], UNRWA, 4 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Center had previously quoted Abu Zayd as saying "we focus on human rights in curriculum" and "the murder of 6 million Jews and 5 million other undesirables ... is not a human-rights issue", and Ging as saying "There is no intention to integrate materials and topics [on the Holocaust] that are inconsistent with the desire of Palestinian society." According to one journalist, Abu Zayd's quotes were "untraceable" and Ging's quote was "based on a computer-generated translation of an Arabic-language report by PalToday, a Gaza Strip-based news agency with Islamist sympathies, quoting a Hamas official who purported to quote Ging".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishexponent.com/article/19543/ UNRWA Denies Holocaust Quotes WASHINGTON (JTA)], Jewish Exponent 10-09-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of UNRWA==
The United Nations agency was criticized by various parties following initial reports that it would not be introducing discussion of the Holocaust in its human rights education:

United States Congresswoman [[Ileana Ros-Lehtinen]] (R-Fla.) said in a statement that "by disconnecting the Holocaust from human rights, (the U.N. agency) is highlighting the [[antisemitic]] bias that pervades the U.N. system."&lt;ref name=caught/&gt;

The [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] called for the dismissal of Abu Zayd and Ging and demanded the United States and Canada suspend funding for the U.N. agency pending the resolution of the issue. The United States was the second-largest donor to the agency in 2008, providing nearly $96 million of its $541.8 million budget.&lt;ref name=caught/&gt;

The [[American Jewish Congress]] said in a statement: "It is... discouraging... that the United Nations Relief and Works Agency did not criticize Hamas for denying the children of Gaza knowledge of one of the central events of the 20th century. Instead, it rushed to deny that the Holocaust was being taught in its schools or that it was contemplating teaching it in the future".&lt;ref name=asked&gt;[http://www.jewishtribune.ca/TribuneV2/index.php/200909082049/UNRWA-asked-to-teach-Holocaust-defy-Hamas.html UNRWA asked to teach Holocaust, defy Hamas], Jewish Tribune 08-09-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other responses==
Jihad Zakarneh, the deputy education minister in the [[West Bank]], said teaching Palestinian children about the Holocaust has to wait until there is a peace agreement with Israel. "When Israel ends its occupation of our land and our people and gives us our right of independence and self-determination, then we discuss this issue with them".&lt;ref name=caught/&gt;

==Aftermath==
In October 2009, John Ging told ''[[The Independent]]'' that he was "confident and determined" that the Holocaust would feature in the curriculum, saying, "no human-rights curriculum is complete without the inclusion of the facts of the Holocaust, and its lessons". At the time, the curriculum was expected to be completed within weeks and then put out for consultation with parents and the public.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Macintyre, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/un-to-teach-children-about-holocaust-in-gaza-schools-1797763.html "UN to teach children about Holocaust in Gaza schools]," The Independent, 5 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2010, Ging confirmed in an interview that the Holocaust was being discussed in UNRWA schools in Gaza, noting "we enrich the curriculum with our human rights program, for all ages. We teach the children about the history of the human rights movement. We grounded our program in the universal declaration of human rights, which is borne out of the horrors of the Second World War. So we teach the children the horrors of the war, including the Holocaust. We are also teaching the kids about the unanimously adopted resolution on Holocaust remembrance, which is a 2005 UN resolution proposed by the state of Israel adopted in the General Assembly".&lt;ref&gt;Adi Schwartz, "[http://www.adi-schwartz.com/unrwas-existence-failure/ UNRWA’s existence is a failure]" (interview with John Ging), Adi Schwartz blog, 15 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

UNRWA efforts brought continued criticism from some Palestinian Islamists. One writer for the pro-Hamas [[Palestine Information Center]] warned that "some circles within UNRWA... have been trying to introduce 'the holocaust' {{sic}} into Palestinian school curricula in the Gaza Strip". He suggested that these efforts indicated "a virulent Zionist propensity to brainwash Palestinians, particularly young generations, into accepting or at least understanding Zionism, a hateful fascist political ideology".&lt;ref&gt;Khalid Ameyreh, "[http://www.palestine-info.co.uk/en/default.aspx?xyz=U6Qq7k%2bcOd87MDI46m9rUxJEpMO%2bi1s7uHZEh0iPWAeNUyBMO4MjFv9Au5eS55O7W1IUimwfbTHIB1SRXbZ6ivf8O4STvfR%2fDU2rfcRzzUiB8PGCHwJfENvTsdBBw26fNjv1YTwCB2o%3d We must not accept holocaust propaganda in our schools]," Palestine Information Center, 5 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further controversy erupted when it became known that UNRWA, as part of a project that brought its top human rights students from Gaza to the United States for a visit, had taken them to an exhibit on the Holocaust at UN headquarters in New York.&lt;ref&gt;No Sharp Objects (documentary, 2010), video excerpts available on "[https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2010/dec/10/gaza-boys-no-sharp-objects-documentary Documentary follows 15 boys from Gaza on trip to US]," ''The Guardian'', 10 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/19/hamas-un-palestinian-trip-holocaust Hamas in dispute with UN over school trips for Palestinian pupils]," The Guardian, 19 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://prrnblog.wordpress.com/2010/12/20/hamas-unrwa-and-human-rights-education/ Hamas, UNRWA, and Human Rights Education]," Palestinian Refugee ResearchNet blog, 20 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a statement issued by the Hamas refugee department, "We denounce this suspicious act in hopes that UNRWA education officials in the Gaza Strip will not repeat it; and we hope the Palestinian Authority will take a national stand to put a stop to ideological corruption on Palestine's youth."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.palestine-info.co.uk/En/default.aspx?xyz=U6Qq7k%2bcOd87MDI46m9rUxJEpMO%2bi1s7BHZU4scReZyDBxFz4OdzpiDXqBEyPlODlakAb9ziW3S81rjt02%2fmxJPu3m89trJ5utY7XE1dAj0jhK7WY4wVYVRCVKLHQ2WK0978wpmpSDM%3d Hamas castigates UNRWA for taking students to sightsee holocaust centers]," Palestine Information Center, 18 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Infrastructure for Peace'' is a new approach in [[peacebuilding]] which gained momentum after locally led and participatory peacebuilding practices tended to yield effective results in some countries beset by conflicts. It underpins the ideas of [[conflict transformation]] and stresses on under-girding the politically negotiated settlements at top level by peacebuilding efforts at the grassroots.

==Definition==
In 2010, governments, political parties, civil society and [[United Nations]] country representatives from 14 African countries in [[Kenya]] agreed upon a working definition of ''infrastructures for peace'' as a ‘dynamic network of interdependent structures, mechanisms, resources, values and skills which, through dialogue and consultation, contribute to conflict prevention and [[peacebuilding]] in a society’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=JPD Editors|title=The Evolving Landscape of Infrastructures for Peace|journal=Journal of Peacebuilding &amp; Development|date=2012|volume=7|issue=3|pages=1–7|doi=10.1080/15423166.2013.774793|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15423166.2013.774793#.VXvjcfmqqko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Studies exemplify [[National Peace Council (Ghana)]], Department on Ethnic, Religious Policy and Civil Society Interaction (Kyrgyzstan)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kumar|first1=Chetan|last2=de la Haye|first2=Jos|title=‘Hybrid Peacemaking: Building National "Infrastructures for Peace"’|journal=Global Governance|date=2012|volume=18|issue=1|pages=13–20|url=http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/crisis%20prevention/UNDP_BCPR_Chetan%20Kumar_Infrastructures%20for%20Peace.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and economical approaches in Guyana, Bolivia and Kenya and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] contributes to about 30 infrastructures for peace projects around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryan|first1=Jordan|title=Infrastructures for Peace as a Path to Resilient Societies: An Institutional Perspective|journal=Journal of Peacebuilding &amp; Development|date=December 2012|volume=7|issue=3|pages=14–24|doi=10.1080/15423166.2013.774806|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15423166.2013.774806#.VXvk9Pmqqko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Critical studies on the ''infrastructure for peace'' mainly see this as a fuzzy concept because [[peacebuilding]] cannot be guaranteed only by local efforts. Such local infrastructures are prone to suffer from political upheavals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chuma|first1=Aeneas|last2=Ojielo|first2=Ozonnia|title=Building a Standing National Capacity for Conflict Prevention and Resolution in Kenya|journal=Journal of Peacebuilding &amp; Development|date=December 2012|volume=7|issue=3|pages=25–39|doi=10.1080/15423166.2013.774790}}&lt;/ref&gt; they still rely on external funding and cannot do well under strictly autocratic regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Odendaal|first1=Andries|title=The Political Legitimacy of National Peace Committees|journal=Journal of Peacebuilding &amp; Development|date=December 2012|volume=7|issue=3|pages=40–53|doi=10.1080/15423166.2013.767601}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21647259.2016.1156813?journalCode=rpcb20 New research works], which conflate infrastructures for peace with [[security sector reform]] have also suggested such architectures need to rise above local boundaries to negotiate on security issues because (in)security has transnational connections.&lt;ref&gt;Ghimire, Safal. 2016.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10812">'''Irenicism''' in [[Christian theology]] refers to attempts to unify Christian [[apologetical]] systems by using [[reason]] as an essential attribute. The word is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''ειρήνη (eirene)'' meaning [[peace]]. It is a concept related to [[natural theology]] and opposed to [[polemicism]] (war-like argumentation) being rooted in the ideals of [[pacifism]]{{fact|date=June 2017}}. Those who affiliate themselves with irenicism identify the importance of unity in the Christian church, and declare the common bond between all Christians under [[Christ]].

==Erasmus and his influence==

[[Desiderius Erasmus]] was a [[Christian humanist]] and reformer, in the sense of checking clerical abuses, honoring inner [[piety]], considering reason as meaningful in theology as in other ways. He also promoted the notion that  Christianity must remain under one church, both theologically and literally; under the body of the [[Catholic Church]]. Since his time, irenicism has postulated removing conflicts between different Christian creeds by way of mediation and gradual amalgamation of theological differences. Erasmus wrote extensively on topics related generally to peace, and an irenic approach is part of the texture of his thought, both on theology and in relation to politics:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Despite the frequency and severity of polemics directed against him, Erasmus continued ... to practice a kind of discourse that is critical and ironic, yet modest and irenic.&lt;ref&gt;Terence J. Martin, ''Living Words: Studies in Dialogues about Religion'' (1998), p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Certain important irenic contributions from Erasmus helped to further the humanist consideration of themes of peace and religious conciliation; these included the ''Inquisitio de fide'' (1524), arguing against the papal opinion that [[Martin Luther]] was a heretic, and ''De sarcienda ecclesiae concordia'' (1533). Erasmus had close associates sharing his views ([[Julius von Pflug]], [[Christoph von Stadion]], and [[Jakob Ziegler]]), and was followed on the Catholic side by [[George Cassander]] and [[Georg Witzel]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter G. Bietenholz, Thomas Brian Deutscher, ''Contemporaries of Erasmus: A Biographical Register of the Renaissance and Reformation'' (2003), p. 78, p. 275 and p. 475.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.science.uva.nl/~seop/archives/win2008/entries/erasmus/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nick Thompson, ''The Long Reach of Reformation Irenicism: the Considerationes Modestae et Pacificae of William Forbes (1585–1634).'' pp. 124–147 in ''Reforming the Reformation'' (2004); [http://www.abdn.ac.uk/~wad005/documents/forbes.pdf PDF] (at p. 2 and p. 8).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The influence of Erasmus was, however, limited, by the virtual exclusion of his works from countries such as France, from 1525, at least in the open; though they did appear in numerous forms and translations. James Hutton speaks of "the surreptitious manner in which Erasmus' peace propaganda reached the French public."&lt;ref&gt;James Hutton, ''Themes of Peace in Renaissance Poetry'' (1984), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Franciscus Junius (the elder)|Franciscus Junius]] published in 1593 ''Le paisible Chrestien'' arguing for [[religious tolerance]] and [[Ecumenism]]. He addressed [[Philip II of Spain]], using arguments taken from the French ''[[politique]]'' statesman [[Michel de l'Hôpital]] and reformer [[Sebastian Castellio]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin van Gelderen, ''The Political Thought of the Dutch Revolt 1555–1590'' (2002), p. 83; [https://books.google.com/books?id=hXK2fxzn2lAC&amp;pg=PA83 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;

==17th century: Catholics and Protestants==
Irenic movements were influential in the 17th century, and irenicism, for example in the form of [[Gottfried Leibniz]]'s efforts to reunite Catholics and Protestants, is in some ways a forerunner to the more modern [[ecumenical]] movements.

The 1589 ''Examen pacifique de la doctrine des Huguenots'' by [[Henry Constable]] proved influential, for example on [[Christopher Potter]] and [[William Forbes (bishop)|William Forbes]]. [[Richard Montagu]] admired Cassander and [[Andreas Fricius]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Milton, ''Catholic and Reformed: The Roman and Protestant Churches in English Protestant Thought, 1600–1640'' (2002), pp. 248–9; [https://books.google.com/books?id=stwluHDJsQgC&amp;pg=PA248 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; The 1628 ''Syllabus aliquot synodorum'' was a bibliography of the literature of religious concord, compiled by [[Jean Hotman, Marquis de Villers-St-Paul]] decades earlier, and seen into print by [[Hugo Grotius]] using the pseudonym "Theodosius Irenaeus," with a preface by [[Matthias Bernegger]].&lt;ref&gt;W. B. Patterson, ''King James VI and I and the Reunion of Christendom'' (2000), p. 149; [https://books.google.com/books?id=zYK_Czpa1WwC&amp;pg=PA149 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;  

It was typical enough, however, for moderate and even irenical writers on the Catholic side to find in this period that their arguments were turned back against Catholicism. This style of arguing developed in England from [[Thomas Bell (priest)|Thomas Bell]] and particularly [[Thomas Morton (bishop)|Thomas Morton]]. It led to [[Thomas James]] mining [[Marcantonio de Dominis]] and [[Paolo Sarpi]], and making efforts to claim Witzel for the Protestant tradition; to the arguments of [[Gallicanism]] being welcomed but also treated as particularly insidious; and an irenist such as [[Francis a Sancta Clara]] being attacked strongly by firm [[Calvinist]]s. The handful of Protestant writers who were convinced in their irenic approach to Catholics included [[William Covell]] and [[Thomas Dove (theologian)|Thomas Dove]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Milton, ''Catholic and Reformed: The Roman and Protestant Churches in English Protestant Thought, 1600–1640'' (2002), pp. 233–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==17th century: Protestant divisions==
[[James I of England]] thought that the Bible translation he commissioned might effect some reconciliation between the English Protestant religious factions, and prove an ''irenicon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Adam |last=Nicolson |title=God's Secretaries |year=2003 |page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek ἐιρηνικόν (''eirenikon'') or peace proposal is also seen as ''irenicum'' in its Latin version.

An irenic literature developed, relating to divisions within Protestantism, particularly in the twenty years after the [[Peace of Westphalia]]. Examples marked out by title are:

*[[David Pareus]], ''Irenicum sive de unione et synodo Evangelicorum'' (1614)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/encyc/encyc11/htm/old/0238=218.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[John Forbes (died 1648)|John Forbes]], ''Irenicum Amatoribus Veritatis et Pacis in Ecclesia Scotiana'' (Aberdeen, 1629)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/encyc/encyc04/htm/0356=340.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Jeremiah Burroughs]], ''Irenicum'' (1653)
*[[John Dury]], ''Irenicum: in quo casus conscientiæ inter ecclesias evangelicas pacis, breviter proponuntur &amp; decidunter'' (1654)
*[[Daniel Zwicker]], ''Irenicum irenicorum'' (1658)
*[[Edward Stillingfleet]], ''Irenicum: A Weapon Salve for the Church's Wounds'' (1659 and 1661)  
*[[Matthew Newcomen]]. ''Irenicum; or, An essay towards a brotherly peace &amp; union, between those of the congregational and presbyterian way'' (1659)
*[[Moses Amyraut]], ''Irenicum sive de ratione pacis in religionis negotio inter Evangelicos'' (1662)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds1.ix.ii.xi.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Samuel Mather (minister)|Samuel Mather]], ''Irenicum: or an Essay for Union'' (1680)

[[Isaac Newton]] wrote an ''Irenicum'' (unpublished manuscript); it supported a [[latitudinarian]] position in theology, derived from a review of church history.&lt;ref&gt;James E. Force, [[Richard Henry Popkin]], ''Newton and Religion: Context, Nature, and Influence'' (1999), p. 146 and p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluation of early modern irenicism==
Anthony Milton writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Ecumenical historians] have tended to assume the existence of an irenical 'essentialism' in which the association of Christian unity with peace, toleration and ecumenism is presupposed. [...] In fact, most thinkers of this period accepted that religious unity was a good idea, in the same way that they believed that sin was a bad idea. The problem was that, of course, different people wanted irenicism on different terms. [...] Different interpretations of irenicism could have direct political implications, making the rhetoric of Christian unity an important tool in the political conflicts of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Milton, ''’The Unchanged Peacemaker’? John Dury and the politics of Irenicism in England, 1628–1643'', p. 96 in Mark Greengrass (editor), ''Samuel Hartlib and Universal Reformation: Studies in Intellectual Communication'' (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is in that light that he comments on the irenists' succession: Erasmus, Cassander, [[Jacob Acontius]], Grotius, then John Dury, who spent much time on a proposed reconciliation of Lutherans and Calvinists.

==Modern usage==

''Irenical'' has become a commonly used adjective to design an idealist and pacific conception, such as the [[democratic peace theory]]. 

''False irenicism'' or ''false eirenism'' is an expression used in certain 20th-century documents of the Catholic Church to criticize attempts at ecumenism that would allow Catholic doctrine to be distorted or clouded. Documents using the term include the encyclical ''[[Humani generis]]'', promulgated by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1950, the [[Second Vatican Council]]'s 1964 Decree on [[Ecumenism]], ''[[Unitatis Redintegratio]],'' and [[Pope John Paul II]]'s 1984 post-synodal apostolic exhortation, ''[[Reconciliatio et paenitentia]]''.

'''İspençe''' was a tax levied on [[non-Muslim]]s in the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=ACCOUNTING METHOD  USED BY OTTOMANS  FOR 500 YEARS: STAIRS (MERDIBAN) METHOD|pages=192|url=http://www.sgb.gov.tr/Publications/Accounting%20Method%20Used%20By%20Ottomans%20For%20500%20Years%20-%20Stairs%20(Merdiban)%20Method.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=morea&gt;{{cite book|title=A historical and economic geography of Ottoman Greece: the southwestern Morea in the 18th century|year=2005|publisher=ASCSA|isbn=978-0-87661-534-8|pages=24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ju9sKUox3OcC&amp;dq=ispence&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

İspençe was a land-tax on non-Muslims in parts of the Ottoman Empire; its counterpart, for Muslim taxpayers, was the resm-i çift - which was set at slightly lower rate.&lt;ref name=Malcolm&gt;{{cite book|last=Malcolm|first=Noel|title=Kosovo: A Short History|year=1999|publisher=Harper Perennial|isbn=978-0-06-097775-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treasury was well aware of the difference in tax takes, and the incentive to convert; the legal reforms of [[Bayezid II]] halved some criminal penalties on nonmuslim taxpayers "''so that the taxpayers shall not vanish''";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heyd|first=Uriel|title=Studies in old Ottoman criminal law|year=1973|publisher=Clarendon Press|pages=156, 287}}&lt;/ref&gt; this rule was reconfimed, a century later, in 1587. In other cases, local taxes were imposed on nonmuslims specifically to encourage conversion.&lt;ref name=Malcolm/&gt;

İspençe had existed in the Balkans before the Ottoman conquest; the Ottoman Empire typically adapted local taxes and institutions in each conquered area, leading to a patchwork of different taxes and rates. The concept of İspençe, theoretically a payment in lieu of [[corvee labour]], was derived from the Byzantine "zeugaratikion", a land tax based on the [[zeugarion]] - the area of farmland which could be ploughed by a pair of oxen. The zeugarion itself was taken up as the Ottoman "[[çift]]", a word meaning "pair".&lt;ref name=Malcolm/&gt;

==Variation==
Despite taxes being set centrally, by the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]], there was some local variance; around 1718. the [[kadı]] of Janjevo complained to Istanbul that the local lord set ispençe at 80 [[akçe]]s per year rather than official rate of 32.&lt;ref name=Malcolm/&gt;

As with other [[Taxation in the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman taxes]], there were various exemptions and loopholes; royal hunters, who provided birds-of-prey to the court, had an exemption from ispençe (and other taxes); they could pass on their job, and the tax exemption, to their sons.&lt;ref name=Acun&gt;{{cite journal|last=Acun|first=Fatma|title=The Other Side of the Coin: Tax Exemptions within the Context of Ottoman Taxation History|journal=Bulgarian Historical Review|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also some exemptions for those unable to work their land through disability, although it was expected that the elderly would have children able to work and therefore to pay ispençe.

The tax was paid by adult male heads of households; in the [[Morea]] it increased to 25 akces (from 20) between 1480 and 1512, and stayed at a similar level after that, (for most), confirmed by the tahrir of 1583; but widows may have paid a reduced rate, and Jews may have paid 125 akces.&lt;ref name=morea/&gt;

'''Italian irredentism in Switzerland''' was a political movement that promoted the unification to [[Italy]] of the Italian-speaking areas of [[Switzerland]] during the [[Risorgimento]].

==History==

In the early 19th century the ideals of unification in a single Nation of all the territories populated by Italian speaking people created the [[Italian irredentism]].

In southern Switzerland those ideals were minimally followed until the creation of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861 and up to [[World War I]].

Following the rise to power of [[Italian Fascism]], however, the initial moderate irredentism started to change to one full of aggression: the same [[Benito Mussolini]] created in the early 1930s the ''Partito Fascista Ticinese'' (Ticino Fascist Party).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpct.ch/pubblicazioni/generale/1986_fraromaeberna.shtml Fra Roma e Berna, di Mauro Cerutti (in Italian)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830110602/http://www.fpct.ch/pubblicazioni/generale/1986_fraromaeberna.shtml |date=2011-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The main ideal of this party was to bring the Italian frontier up to the [[Gotthard Pass|Gottardo Pass]] (''Catena mediana delle Alpi'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italiasvizzera150.it/img-schede/8-img1.jpg Map of "Catena mediana delle Alpi" as possible northern Italian border in Switzerland]&lt;/ref&gt;)  in the Alps through political unrest and possible referendums (supported, in case of need, by the Italian Army).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italiasvizzera150.it/studenti.cfm?target=8|title=Italia-Svizzera: la storia dal 1861 al 2011|first=Contechnet.it massimo|last=rossi|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934 was done a small tentative by the Ticino fascists: the March on Bellinzona", similar to the [[March on Rome]]. But it was successfully contrasted by socialist organizations, like "Liberi e Svizzeri" of Guglielmo Canevascini, promoted even by the Swiss government.&lt;ref&gt;M. Cerutti, Fra Roma e Berna. La Svizzera italiana nel ventennio fascista, p. 465.&lt;/ref&gt;

Successively, in the 1935 elections the fascists obtained just 2% of the votes and since then their movement faded away to less than 100 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wArTkIKE7WAC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;lpg=PA164&amp;dq=marcia%20su%20bellinzona%201934&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=M7NuGyUtLJ&amp;sig=B8Mka8gIAdIpIFTalz1R9NVqWDk&amp;hl=it&amp;ei=UUmFTNraH5qKnAe4v5yTAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=marcia%20su%20bellinzona%201934&amp;f=false|title=Il cattolicesimo ticinese e i fascismi: la Chiesa e il partito conservatore ticinese nel periodo tra le due guerre mondiali|date=1 January 1999|publisher=Saint-Paul|accessdate=12 January 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:RegioniIrredenteItalia.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Map of the Italian areas called "irredente" in 1918. Ticino in green]]
Before [[World War II]] the Italian irredentism in Switzerland was reduced to have followers mainly between the descendants of Italians emigrated to Ticino at the end of the 19th century, but was ruled and promoted by a small group of ticino intellectuals with their active newspapers and propaganda.

The most important of these intellectuals was Teresina Bontempi, who created the magazine ''L'Adula''.  She denounced in her writings, together with Rosetta Colombi, the [[germanization]] of Canton Ticino promoted by the Swiss government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ps-ticino.ch/sonvico/mondo/pubblicazioni/Crespi,Ticino%20irredento04.htm  Il sogno irredentista del Ticino (in Italian)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, the German speaking population in Canton Ticino went from  2.6%  in 1837 to 5.34% in 1920 and nearly 10% in 1940.

As a consequence of this political activity she was involved in continuous problems with the Swiss government, that finally jailed her in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Ilse Shneiderfranken.Le industrie del Canton Ticino. Belinzona, 1937&lt;/ref&gt; She was forced to move to Italy as a political refugee after some months.

The most renowned fascist born in Canton Ticino was Aurelio Garobbio, who tried to imitate [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]] with his organization called ''Giovani Ticinesi''.&lt;ref&gt;Garobbio, Aurelio. ''Gabriele D'Annunzio e i «Giovani Ticinesi»: le vicende de «L'Adula»'' p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; After 1935 Garobbio was the main responsible of the Italian irredentism in Switzerland and was with Mussolini until his death in spring 1945, when tried to organize a last fascist area of defense in [[Valtellina]] next to Ticino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2m_xg6W8oGUC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;lpg=PA165&amp;dq=aurelio%20garobbio&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eL5Ipaj9P7&amp;sig=Pn59UpC7B2OtcpxsUeI5toJj08I&amp;hl=it&amp;ei=RG2FTKqQHNOfnQeG4ZTxDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=aurelio%20garobbio&amp;f=false|title=Com'era rossa la mia valle: una storia di antiresistenza in Valtellina|first=Giuseppe|last=Rocco|date=1 January 1992|publisher=GRECO &amp; GRECO Editori|accessdate=12 January 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jantantrik Bahujan Samaj Party''' (Democratic Majority Society Party), splinter group of [[Bahujan Samaj Party]] (BSP) formed in 1997 when 19 BSP Members of the Legislative Assembly of [[Uttar Pradesh]] broke away. JBSP allied themselves with [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) and joined the [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]]. In UP they gave their support to [[Kalyan Singh]]'s government. 17 out of the JBSP MLAs were inducted as ministers in the state government. The president of JBSP was DP Yadav ([[Rajya Sabha]] MP) and the general secretary Shahidullah Khan.

JBSP became an unstable party, and suffered various splits. Four MLAs defected to [[Lok Jan Shakti Party]]. Another splinter group was [[Kisan Mazdoor Bahujan Party]].

When JBSP fell apart DP Yadav organized a new party, [[Rashtriya Parivartan Dal]].

JBSP should not be confused with another BSP splinter group, [[Loktantrik Bahujan Samaj Party]].

The '''Modified Scheme of Elementary Education''' or '''New Scheme of Elementary Education''' or '''Madras Scheme of Elementary Education'''  dubbed by its critics as '''Kula Kalvi Thittam''' (Hereditary Education Policy), was an abortive attempt at education reform introduced by the [[Indian National Congress]] Government of the [[Madras State]], led by [[C. Rajagopalachari]] (Rajaji) in 1953. The scheme proposed the introduction of two shifts or sessions in elementary schools. In one session regular teaching would be done and during the second session, the students would be sent home to learn the occupations of their parents. It became controversial and was accused of being a casteist scheme to perpetuate the caste hierarchy as Hindu Professions were [[Varna (Hinduism)|caste based]].&lt;ref name="Vaasanthi2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vaasanthi|title=Cut-outs, Caste and Cines Stars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ldacEfF58EC&amp;pg=PA144|accessdate=7 October 2015|year=2008|publisher=Penguin Books India|isbn=978-0-14-306312-4|pages=144–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Public opposition and internal dissent within the congress led to the deferment of the scheme. The discontent it triggered among the Congress legislature members forced the resignation of Rajaji as Chief Minister. The scheme was dropped completely by Rajaji's successor [[K. Kamaraj|Kamaraj]] in 1954.

==Background==
According to the 1951 Census of India, the literacy rate in the [[Madras State]] was 20.86%.&lt;ref&gt;Yazali, P.172&lt;/ref&gt; During fiscal year 1950-51, the Madras State Government spent 6.87 crore Rupees (6,870,000) - about 11.5% of total revenues for the state - for Elementary education. The enrollment rate for children of school-going age was around 47.8%.&lt;ref name=B&gt;[http://www.education.nic.in/cd50years/g/12/28/12280V01.htm Appendix Q : Modified Scheme of Elementary Education, Madras] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927150034/http://www.education.nic.in/cd50years/g/12/28/12280V01.htm |date=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Directive Principles in India|Directive Principles of the Indian Constitution]] require the Indian state to provide education to all citizens. In accordance to this directive, in 1950 the Madras State's Directorate of Public Instruction prepared a ten-year plan to provide education to all children of school-going age. This plan called for an allocation of one crore Rs (1,00,00,000) per year for enrolling 500,000 additional students for the next ten years. Against this, the actual allocation in 1950-51 was only Rs. 500,000. The cost of educating a student was estimated to be around Rs.22.80 per year, out of which the government's contribution was Rs.16.30.&lt;ref name="B"/&gt; Out of the 12,22,775 students who had enrolled in standard I in 1946-47, only 4,61,686 (37%) had reached the Standard V in 1950-51. It was against this background, the Congress party with [[Rajaji]] as chief minister took power on 10 April 1952.

The opposition to the scheme was largely based on social background. Hindu professions are based on [[Varna (Hinduism)|Varna or Caste]] with the [[Brahmins]] the highest in the order and studied while [[Kshatriya]] and [[Vaishya]] traders received some education. [[Shudra]] were denied education. [[Dalits]] were considered untouchables and did manual work and also denied education. When the [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]] came to power in 1920, Brahmins disproportionately occupied over 70% of the high level posts in government, judiciary and in education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archive.tehelka.com/story_main17.asp?filename=Ne042206superiority.asp | title=Superiority in Numbers | publisher=Tehelka | accessdate=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]] introduced caste based reservation and this gradually reversed this trend and allowed non-Brahmins to rise in the government and education in [[Madras Presidency]].  The first generation of [[Dalits]], [[Scheduled Castes and Tribes]] and [[Backward Classes]] also started getting educated and their children had just begun to attend school after centuries of denial of educational opportunities under the rigid Hindu caste system. As per this policy schools were to work in the morning and students had to compulsorily learn the family vocation in the afternoon. This was seen as a ploy to ensure the domination and monopoly of Brahmins. The ulterior motive behind the scheme was understood to be that the children of non-Brahmins should undertake only the manual jobs of their ancestors such as washerman, barber, scavenger, cobbler etc. and they should not aspire for any higher education or for any white collar employment, which only Brahmins could claim as their exclusive privilege. They should follow their parents' professions and remain in their low status and lowly paid professions. Such a step would maintain caste hegemony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Kumaradoss  |first=Y. Vincent |title=

==Earlier attempts at change==
In 1939, during [[Rajaji]]'s first term as Chief Minister of the [[Madras Presidency]], the girl students of standards III to V and those belonging to Scheduled Castes had been allowed to attend school for only three hours a day and spend the rest of the day helping their parents. In the academic year 1949-50, during the Chief ministership of [[P. S. Kumaraswamy Raja]], an experimental shift system had been introduced in ten [[Tehsil|taluks]] and later expanded to other areas as an optional measure. Schools which adapted this system functioned in two shifts or sessions. Teachers who worked during both sessions were paid an additional allowance of 10 Rupees per month. However this system was not widely adopted and by 1951 only 155 elementary schools (out of a total 38,687) in the state were functioning in shifts.&lt;ref name=B/&gt;

==Reasons stated for the reform attempt==
* The cost of educating all children in the 6-12 age group would be enormous. Besides enrollment, more than half of the elementary schools lacked proper infrastructure. The reform attempted to increase the number of school-going children within the financial limitations faced by the Government.&lt;ref name=C&gt;[http://www.education.nic.in/cd50years/g/12/28/12281301.htm Appendix T : Modified Scheme of Elementary Education, Madras] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927150114/http://www.education.nic.in/cd50years/g/12/28/12281301.htm |date=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There was an acute shortage of teachers. The state had an average of less than three teachers for five standards per school. There were 4,108 single-teacher schools and more than 60% of the schools with five standards had less than four teachers.&lt;ref name="B"/&gt;&lt;ref name="C"/&gt;
* This poor student-teacher ratio was putting a strain on the teachers and led to students being made to stay in school for longer hours. This directly contributed to the high drop out ratio. This plural teaching had to be stopped without hiring new teachers.&lt;ref name="B"/&gt;
* Rajaji favoured [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]]'s Basic Education Scheme over the existing elementary education system. He stated that he wanted to reduce the unemployment amongst educated people.&lt;ref name=D&gt;Bakshi, P.323&lt;/ref&gt; The Basic education system called for learning through living and training in self-reliance.&lt;ref name="B"/&gt;
* The retention rate of 37% (between 1947 and 1951) had to be improved by making schools attractive to students of poorer sections.&lt;ref name="B"/&gt;&lt;ref name="C"/&gt;

==Proposals in the new scheme==
The Modified Scheme of Elementary education proposed the following changes in the school system:&lt;ref name="B"/&gt;&lt;ref name="C"/&gt;

* Reduction of School hours from five hours per day to three.
* Introduction of shifts -the students were to be divided into two batches and the school would function in two sessions. Each session will be of three hours duration, consisting of four periods of 40 minutes each, with not less than two intervals totaling 20 minutes. The sessions will be arranged to suit local conditions. One batch will attend only one session a day. There were to be six working days per week.
* No dilution of the previous syllabus and no reduction in duration for subjects like Language, Elementary Mathematics, Nature Study, Drawing, History, Geography, Hygiene, Civics, Moral Instruction and Singing.
* The second session in which the students would be out of school was to be utilised for obtaining the objectives of the basic education system - learning through living and training in self-reliance.
* During the out of school session, the girl students were to learn house keeping from their mothers in their home environment. The boys were supposed to learn farming or other crafts from their respective fathers.
* Boys whose parents did not belong to occupational groups, were to be sent to work in farms or with other craftsmen in their villages.
* In addition to the learning the students were to be utilised in service to the village like ''building sheds,laying bricks, attending to village sanitation, improving roads, etc.''.
* The out of school session would have no strict attendance or work requirements.

==Implementation==
The Rajaji Government introduced the new elementary education scheme in all schools in the non-municipal (rural) areas for the academic year 1953-54 (from 18 June 1953). It was planned that eventually the scheme would be extended to 35,000 of the total 38,687 schools in the state. However, due to public opposition, it was put on hold on 29 July 1953 and dropped altogether on 18 May 1954.&lt;ref name=E&gt;[http://www.assembly.tn.gov.in/archive/resumes/review_01assly/ch14.pdf Chapter XIV, A Review of Madras Legislative Assembly(1952-57)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition==

From the beginning, the scheme attracted heavy opposition from the Dravidian movement led by [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy]]. The [[Dravidar Kazhagam]] organised a conference in [[Erode]] protesting the scheme's introduction.&lt;ref name=I/&gt; The teachers' unions also opposed their move as they were not consulted before implementation. They also resented the increase in working hours without any increase in pay.&lt;ref name=Y/&gt; The [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam|DMK]] seized the opportunity and started a campaign against the scheme. They dubbed the scheme as the ''Kula kalvi thittam'' (Hereditary/Caste Education Scheme) and as the ''Acharyar Education Scheme''.&lt;ref&gt;Ryerson, P.89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=F/&gt; The Dravidian movement viewed the scheme as an attempt to preserve and perpetuate caste based discrimination through official means. They used Rajaji's notions about caste and village craftsmen to depict the scheme as a "Brahminist conspiracy". Rajaji had earlier expressed his opinion about castes and crafts as:

{{cquote|The food is grown, the cloth is woven, the sheep are shorn, the shoes are stitched, the scavenging is done, the cartwheels and the ploughs are built and repaired because, thank God, the respective castes are still there and the homes are trade schools as well and the parents are masters as well, to whom the children are automatically apprenticed.&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi. p.245&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the scheme was announced, Rajaji gave a speech to the washermen at the [[Adyar River|Adyar]] riverbank. In it he referred to ''Kuladharma'', the social obligation of each clan or caste. The opposition used such incidents to lend credence to their "casteist motive" accusation.&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi. p.248&lt;/ref&gt; Rajaji and his education minister [[Mandali Venkata Krishna Rao|MV Krishna Rao]] responded with a counter campaign in the scheme's defense. They gave speeches and made broadcasts in the All India Radio explaining their position.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Review Vol.54, P.332&lt;/ref&gt; The month of June 1953 saw aggressive propaganda efforts by both the proponents and opponents of the scheme. On 13 July 1953, the DMK executive committee met and decided to conduct a ''marial'' (blockade) agitation outside the Chief Minister's residence. [[E. V. K. Sampath|EVK Sampath]] was nominated to lead the agitation.&lt;ref name=F&gt;[http://www.sangam.org/2009/09/Anna_Centennial_3.php?print=true Anna's Birth Centennial Anthology]&lt;/ref&gt; This agitation was part of a three pronged attack on the Government's policies by the DMK. On 14 July 1953, a possession led by [[Satyavani Muthu]] was organised to protest the scheme. Its destination was Rajaji's official residence at Bazullah road, [[T. Nagar]]. It was stopped by the police as it was unlicensed.&lt;ref name=F/&gt; The next day (15 July 1953) the confrontation heated up with the Government introducing a motion in the Legislative Assembly for implementing the scheme from the academic year 1953-54. On the same day another DMK procession was stopped before it could reach T Nagar. In the next fifteen days as many as twenty such processions were attempted by the DMK.&lt;ref name=F/&gt;

==Deferment==
By the end of July, public opinion started to turn against the scheme and at least four public petitions were tabled in the Legislative Assembly about the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assembly.tn.gov.in/archive/Resumes/review_01assly/table17.pdf Table XVII, A Review of Madras Legislative Assembly(1952-57)]&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 July 1953, M.V Krishna Rao, the minister for education moved a motion for considering the new scheme. After a discussion, [[Communist Party of India|Communist]] leader [[K. P Gopalan]] moved a motion to drop the scheme. The house was deadlocked with 138 ayes to 138 noes on dropping the scheme. The speaker of the assembly [[J. Shivashanmugam Pillai]] used his casting vote to defeat the motion. A second motion to defer the scheme and refer it to a committee of experts was moved by [[K. R. Viswanathan|K.R Viswanatham]]. This motion passed with 138 ayes against 137 noes.&lt;ref name=E/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assembly.tn.gov.in/archive/Resumes/review_01assly/table16.pdf Table XVI, A Review of Madras Legislative Assembly(1952-57)]&lt;/ref&gt; The Scheme was stayed&lt;ref&gt;The word "stay" in the motion was interpreted by Rajaji and C. Subramaniam as "keep the status quo" as on the day of the vote. In other words, the scheme would be kept in place in the schools where it was already introduced and it won't be extended to other schools. They disregarded the oppositions demands to cancel the scheme in all the schools. Gandhi. p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; and the Parulekar Committee was commissioned to review the scheme.

==Parulekar committee==
On 20 August 1953, the Government passed an order (Education G.O # 1888) to constitute a committee of experts for reviewing the scheme.&lt;ref name=H&gt;[http://www.education.nic.in/cd50years/g/t/HJ/0THJ0509.htm Report, Director of Information and Publicity]&lt;/ref&gt; The committee was composed of Prof. RV. Parulekar, Director of Indian Institute of Education Bombay, as the Chairman; Dr.B.B. Dey, Retired Director of Public Instruction, Madras; Prof. Mohammad Mujeeb, Vice-Chancellor of the [[Jamia Millia Islamia|Jamia Millia University]] as members and S. Govindarajulu Naidu, the former Director of Public Instruction, Madras, and the then Director of Public Instruction, [[Andhra Pradesh]], as the Member Secretary.&lt;ref name=C/&gt; The Parulekar committee submitted its report on 23 November 1953. It found the scheme to be sound and endorsed the Government's position. It made additional recommendations including extending the scheme to rural areas, opening as many as 4000 new schools, revising the existing curriculum, providing training and remuneration to the craftsmen involved.&lt;ref name=H/&gt;

==Cancellation==
The opposition campaign was successful in creating doubts about the scheme in the minds of the general public. There was dissent within the Congress party and [[K. Kamaraj|Kamaraj]] wanted Rajaji to withdraw the scheme as it was unpopular amongst the public and with the party members.&lt;ref name=Z&gt;Subramaniam, p.205&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 October 1953, forty Congress Legislative Assembly members led by [[P. Varadarajulu Naidu]], sent a memorandum to Nehru objecting to Rajaji's unilateral conduct. Among the issues they raised was his refusal to budge on the education scheme issue.&lt;ref&gt;Nehru Vol24, p.288&lt;/ref&gt; But Rajaji refused to drop the scheme. On 8 November 1953, Congress lost the by election for the [[Kangayam (State Assembly Constituency)|Kangayam constituency]] by a narrow margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/ByeElection/Bye-ele-results%2052-95.xls|title=By election results 1952-1995|work=Election Commission of India|accessdate=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gazette of India, p.88&lt;/ref&gt; Pressure mounted from within the party to drop the scheme. On 9 March 1954, Congress leader and former Chief Minister [[O. P. Ramaswamy Reddiyar]] made an open appeal to Rajaji in the legislature:

{{Cquote|Please give up the scheme without any more ado. It is a new handle to the Blackshirts [Dravidar Kazhagam]. Persistence will sound only the death knell of the party.&lt;ref name=gandhi251&gt;Gandhi. pp.250-251&lt;/ref&gt;}}

But Rajaji did not relent and his education minister [[Chidambaram Subramaniam|C Subramaniam]] upped the ante by announcing that the scheme would be extended to urban areas in June 1954. This spurred the Congress legislators into open revolt. They scheduled a meeting of the Congress Legislative Party on 21 March. Faced with certain defeat in the leadership election that was bound to happen in that meeting, Rajaji tried a last minute compromise - he would quit if C. Subramaniam was chosen as his successor and the scheme was kept. But Kamaraj, the leader of the anti-Rajaji camp, refused to accept the deal.&lt;ref name=gandhi251/&gt; The meeting was postponed by a week and when it happened on March 31, C. Subramaniam was defeated by Kamaraj.&lt;ref&gt;Kandaswamy, p51-52&lt;/ref&gt; Rajaji resigned and Kamaraj took over as chief minister on 13 April 1954. This effectively ended the prospects of the new education scheme. On 18 May 1954, C Subramaniam announced in the assembly that the scheme was being dropped. The reason stated for the dropping was ''that the necessary acceptance, support and cooperation of the people were not forthcoming for the scheme and the atmosphere was not propitious for the success of the scheme''.&lt;ref name=A&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2004/05/19/stories/2004051900240903.htm The Hindu report on 19 May 1954 : Scheme dropped]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the composite Madras State had been reorganised along linguistic lines. The state of [[Andhra Pradesh|Andhra]] had split from Madras on 1 October 1953. The Andhra Government constituted an Elementary Education Committee with Dr. B. Kuppuswamy as chairman to review the elementary education situation. The Kuppuswamy committee report recommended the rejection of the Modified Elementary Education Scheme. In 1954 the Andhra state cancelled the scheme.&lt;ref name=X&gt;Indian Review Vol.55, p.284&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

The main arguments made against the Modified Scheme of Elementary Education were :
*That the scheme was casteist by design. It aimed to preserve and perpetuate the caste hierarchy by ensuring that children took up their parents' profession. It was designed to help Brahmins corner positions of authority .&lt;ref name=I&gt;Vasantha Kandaswamy p.262-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=F/&gt;
*That it intended to reduce the schooling imparted to children by not monitoring them during out of school sessions.&lt;ref&gt;Bakshi, p.325&lt;/ref&gt;
*That it would increase the workload of teachers as it would increase their working hours and force them to handle more children without the appointment of new teachers and without an increase in their pay.&lt;ref name=Y&gt;Balratnam, P.91&lt;/ref&gt;
*That it was undemocratic and dictatorial as Rajaji had not consulted his cabinet or the assembly in his decision to implement the scheme (In Rajaji's own words - ''This is an executive matter, no law is involved'' and'' Did [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] and [[Ramanuja]] announce their philosophy after consulting others''?).&lt;ref name=Y/&gt;&lt;ref name=F/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kannan p.203&lt;/ref&gt;
*That it was deliberately targeted at rural children alone to keep them from getting an education.&lt;ref&gt;Vashisht, p.52&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''Viduthalai'' on 17 November 1953, [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy|Periyar]] denounced the scheme as a Brahiminical conspiracy:

{{Cquote|This educational policy is a casteist educational policy. This has to be opposed and abolished...Is this educational scheme not a reconstruction and protection of varnashrama?...who physically labours and slaves in the name of caste? Only we, who are called sudras...should we keep doing the caste occupation while brahmins alone get positions,employment, authority and go higher and higher?...is this justified?..we don't think physical labour is disgraceful, but why should we alone do that work?....

...How much of opposition to Rajaji’s minister post? Though the situation is such that his post can topple any day. If he can manage all that and still have a tight grip, what is it for? Only to save his race, only for the protection of the Brahmin society. As long as he is in power, he wants to fill up Brahmins in all the places. He wants to repress the Sudras, and with that motive alone he remains in power. Among us we do not have this mind, this feeling, this racial fanaticism! He fights for the welfare of the Brahmin race...&lt;ref name="I"/&gt;}}

In another ''Viduthalai'' article written on 26 February 1954, he vowed to destroy the scheme by any means:

{{Cquote|Rajaji says that people in the villages do not need education.He has said that the student in the village should cut hair, he should wash clothes, and he should make pots and pans. The village school is only for three hours duration, the rest of the time our children should graze donkeys, this is called the New Primary Education Scheme. We organized a conference in Erode only to oppose this educational scheme. Can we keep looking at law and democracy in such a situation? The work will be successful only through a great revolution. Though 100, 1000 of us will have to be sacrificed, we need to be prepared. That is why even I gave a three months notice; and said that if they want to shoot, let them shoot. I am going to start a struggle. This educational scheme has to be destroyed by all means.&lt;ref name="I"/&gt;}}

He kept up his harangue even after Rajaji resigned and C Subramaniam became the new Education minister. On 17 April 1954 he wrote:

{{Cquote|Rajaji did this only because of the fear that the position of his society will disappear. If the Vanaan washes clothes, if the Paraiyan beats the drums, if the Chakkili stitches shoes, if the Ambattan shaves, only then they will get the feeling that they are a low caste. If they also get educated and come ahead, the highness of the upper castes will disappear. So, Rajaji interfered in the basics by introducing a 3-hour occupational education...

...The servant of this Rajaji, C. Subramanian was the one who raised his hand to say that Sudras don’t need communal representation. Those who had gone on the merit of our votes were sitting there like the five Pandavas during Draupadi’s disrobing. All this takes place in this country. If it had been another country, four or five (death) anniversaries would have been observed for such people. When it is so, how can we fight legally?&lt;ref name="I"/&gt;}}

The Andhra Elementary Education Committee Report also rejected the Modified Scheme and recommended an approach similar to the one eventually adopted by the Kamaraj Government.&lt;ref name=X/&gt;

==Defense and endorsements==
During and after his tenure as Chief Minister, Rajaji defended his scheme vigorously. He derided the critics as people who did not want to do physical labour:

{{Cquote| The opposition to the scheme comes mainly from those who do not want to do any physical labour. There are others who ask whether there will be any examination in the crafts. That may come or may not come. But I would like you to ponder over one factor. Are not the children of parents with an educational tradition at an advantage now over children whose parents have no education at all? Should an examination in crafts be held, will not the children of illiterate artisans score over the other class of children? In that way will not the handicap of the poor man's children be removed? The new system gives a chance to the backward people to progress. I would, therefore, appeal to you all to support the scheme or at least desist from opposing it.&lt;ref name="J"&gt;Rajagopalachari, P.115&lt;/ref&gt;}}

About the casteist angle of the criticism, he reasoned that it was because of him being the author of the scheme:

{{Cquote| It is indeed regrettable that it should be said that there is a big conspiracy behind the new scheme. Probably because i am its author, some people suspect there is something behind it..If some other person would have done it, by God's grace, everyone might have accepted it and the scheme might have worked successfully...I made similar suggestions over 30 years ago.&lt;ref name="D"/&gt;}}

After the Kamaraj Government scrapped the scheme, he again defended it as :

{{Cquote| My plan was based on the conviction - which was confirmed by educational officers of highest rank and experience - that three hours attendance was quite adequate for the purpose and would leave nothing out of the present elementary school instruction.&lt;ref name="K"&gt;Bakshi, P. 168&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Replying to [[Papanasam (State Assembly Constituency)|Papanasam]] MLA Swayam Prakasam's concerns over the scheme, then Prime Minister, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] offered his endorsement to the scheme:

{{Cquote| As for the education policy which Rajaji has sponsored, I cannot speak for conditions in Madras. But that policy is an aspect of Basic Education which is the proved policy of our Government. The Madras proposals, as you know, were referred to a special High-powered Committee of Educationists. They expressed their approval of them. ...At the Governors' Conference recently, the Madras proposals were not directly discussed, but the present system was discussed and thoroughly disapproved of and generally the basic system was approved.&lt;ref&gt;Nehru Vol25, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;}}

India's President [[Rajendra Prasad]] offered his support in a letter written to the Governor of Madras - [[Sri Prakasa]] - on 9 June 1953:

{{Cquote| I have read with great interest both the speech of Rajaji and the scheme of education in primary schools in rural areas. I have felt great dissatisfaction with the present scheme of things so far as education is concerned... with the large number of graduates and under graduates we are turning out from year to year are without any employment...most of them are unemployable...

This scheme fits them at any rate for their parents' work or for the work people have been doing in their own place. With education it may be hoped that they would be able to do that work better. I there look forward with great hope and enthusiasm to this experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Rajendra Prasad, P. 72&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Central Advisory Board of Education, passed a resolution endorsing the scheme during its 21st Meeting held in February 1954:

{{Cquote|  "The Central Advisory Board of Education has given careful consideration to the Modified Scheme of Elementary Education formulated by the Madras Government. It is of the opinion that the Scheme represents a welcome attempt to bring education within the reach of a large majority of children and thus help in the achievement of the constitutional directive about the provision of universal Primary Education. The Board is also satisfied that the reduction of school hours from five to three will not necessarily affect the education of children adversely, provided the out-of-school activities which are an integral part of the education of children are implemented under controlled conditions. The Board also appreciates the attempt made in the Scheme for bringing education into closer contact with the life of the community and this gives it a practical bias which is at present lacking in ordinary Primary Schools.

The Board would, however, like to point out that the arrangements made for the out-of-school activities of the children need to be carefully supervised on the lines suggested by the Parulekar Committee and their success critically assessed from time to time. Further, the Board would like to place on record its definite opinion that this Scheme is valuable as an interim measure only, because, sufficient funds are not at present available for providing education to all the children and that the proper pattern of education for the country is Basic Education which would offer full-time co-related education to children in which teaching of craft as well as of other school subjects will be provided under proper educative conditions in the school itself, which will serve as a community centre where the school and the community are brought into an organic relationship.

The Board would also recommend that other States may conduct similar experiments under controlled conditions. (The Madras Government have since intimated their decision to discontinue their modified scheme of Elementary Education)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.education.nic.in/cd50years/g/12/28/12280202.htm Central Advisory Board of Education - Proceedings of the 21st Meeting, Item IV]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Legacy==
The Modified Scheme of Elementary Education even after being dropped had the unintended consequence of bringing primary education to hundreds of thousands of school children in [[Tamil Nadu]]. Rajaji's successor Kamaraj was ever mindful of the fact that it was the issue of primary education that caused his predecessor's downfall. Knowing the public opposition to Rajaji's scheme he took the diametrically opposite approach in providing education to Tamil Nadu's children - imparting free and compulsory education till the age of 14. He set up a commission&lt;ref name="L"&gt;Kandaswamy, P. 65&lt;/ref&gt; under R.M. Alagappa Chettiar to examine the means for providing compulsory primary education. Instead of sending children away from the school, the committee recommended active Government intervention to bring more children into the schooling system by building new schools and abolishing school fees.&lt;ref name=H/&gt; This approach was successful and by the end of Kamaraj's tenure as Chief Minister in 1963, enrollment in primary schools had been doubled.&lt;ref name="L"/&gt;

'''Neo-Nazism''' consists of post-[[World War II]] militant social or political movements seeking to revive and implement the ideology of [[Nazism]]. Neo-Nazis seek to employ their ideology to promote hatred and attack minorities, or in some cases to create a fascist political state.&lt;ref&gt;Gay, Kathlyn (1997) [https://books.google.com/books?id=NWYLkF5NHVsC&amp;q=%22Neo-nazis%22+goals&amp;dq=%22Neo-nazis%22+goals&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3pYzk05raAhXjT98KHehxDawQ6AEINTAC ''Neo-Nazis: A Growing Threat'']. Enslow. p.114. {{isbn|9780894909016}}. Quote: "Neo-Nazis ... use fear and violence in their efforts to destroy minorities. Their goal is to '''''establish''''' a "superior" society."(emphasis added)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staff (ndg) [https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/neo-nazi "Ideologies: Neo Nazi"] [[Southern Poverty Law Center]]. Quote: "While some neo-Nazi groups emphasize simple hatred, others are more focused on the revolutionary '''''creation of a fascist political state'''''." (emphasis added)&lt;/ref&gt; It is a global phenomenon, with organized representation in many countries and international networks. It borrows elements from Nazi doctrine, including [[ultranationalism]], [[racism]], [[xenophobia]], [[ableism]], [[homophobia]], [[anti-Romanyism]], [[antisemitism]], [[anti-communism]] and initiating the [[Fourth Reich]]. [[Holocaust denial]] is a common feature, as is the incorporation of [[Nazi symbolism|Nazi symbols]] and admiration of [[Adolf Hitler]].

In some [[Europe]]an and [[Latin America]]n countries, laws prohibit the expression of pro-Nazi, racist, anti-Semitic, or homophobic views. Many Nazi-related symbols are banned in European countries (especially [[Strafgesetzbuch_section_86a|Germany]]) in an effort to curtail neo-Nazism.&lt;ref&gt;

The term ''neo-Nazism'' can also refer to the [[ideology]] of these movements, which may borrow elements from Nazi doctrine, including [[ultranationalism]], [[anti-communism]], [[racism]], [[ableism]], [[xenophobia]], [[homophobia]], [[anti-Romanyism]], [[antisemitism]], up to initiating the [[Fourth Reich]].

===Hyperborean racial doctrine===

Neo-Nazi writers have posited a spiritual, esoteric doctrine of [[Race (human categorization)|race]], which moves beyond the primarily [[Darwinian]]-inspired materialist [[scientific racism]] popular mainly in the [[Anglosphere]] during the 20th century. Figures influential in the development of neo-Nazi racism,{{cn|reason=Citation needed for 'influential in the development of neo-Nazi racism', as our only current cited source (Southern Poverty Law Center, 2015) presents them as influential on the 'bizarre fringes' of Nazism, but racism is central to Nazism, not just part of its fringe|date=October 2018}} such as [[Miguel Serrano]] and [[Julius Evola]] (writers who are described by critics of Nazism such as the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] as influential within what it presents as parts of "the bizarre fringes of National Socialism, past and present"),&lt;ref name=2015-02-08&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2002/new-book-black-sun-looks-fringes-national-socialism|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|title=New Book, Black Sun, Looks at Fringes of National Socialism|date=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; claim that the [[Hyperborean]] ancestors of the [[Aryans]] were in the distant past, far higher beings than their current state, having suffered from "involution" due to mixing with the "Telluric" peoples; supposed creations of the [[Demiurge]]. Within this theory, if the "Aryans" are to return to the [[Golden Age]] of the distant past, they need to awaken the memory of the blood. An [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] origin of the Hyperboreans is often claimed. These theories draw influence from [[Gnosticism]] and [[Tantrism]], building on the work of the [[Ahnenerbe]]. Within this racist theory, Jews are held up as the antithesis of nobility, purity and beauty.

===Ecology and environmentalism===
Neo-Nazism generally aligns itself with a [[blood and soil]] variation of [[environmentalism]], which has themes in common with [[deep ecology]], the [[organic movement]] and [[animal protectionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.com/en/neo-nazis-cloak-themselves-in-eco-rhetoric/a-15793310|publisher=DW|title=Neo-Nazis cloak themselves in eco-rhetoric|date=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.redpepper.org.uk/darker-shades-of-green/|publisher=Red Pepper|title=Darker Shades of Green|date=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency, sometimes called "[[ecofascism]]", was represented in the original German National Socialism by [[Richard Walther Darré]] who was the [[Reichsminister of Food]] from 1933 until 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spunk.org/texts/places/germany/sp001630/peter.html|publisher=Peter Staudenmaier|title=Fascist Ecology: The "Green Wing" of the Nazi Party and its Historical Antecedents|date=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
=== Germany and Austria 1945–1950s===
Following the defeat of [[Nazi Germany]], the political ideology of the ruling party, Nazism, was in complete disarray. The final leader of the [[Nazi Party|National Socialist German Workers' Party]] was [[Martin Bormann]]. He died on 2 May 1945 during the [[Battle of Berlin]], but the [[Soviet Union]] did not reveal his death to the rest of the world, and his ultimate fate remained a mystery for many years. [[Conspiracy theories about Adolf Hitler's death|Conspiracy theories]] emerged about Hitler himself, that he had secretly survived the war and fled to South America or elsewhere.

The [[Allied Control Council]] officially dissolved the NSDAP on 10 October 1945, marking the end of "Old" National Socialism. A process of [[denazification]] began, and the [[Nuremberg trials]] took place, where many major leaders and ideologues were condemned to death by October 1946, others committed suicide.

[[File:Otto Ernst Remer portrait.JPG|thumb|right|175px|It[[Otto Ernst Remer]], leader of the postwar [[Socialist Reich Party]]]]

In both the East and West, surviving ex-party members and military veterans assimilated to the new reality and had no interest in constructing a "neo-Nazism."{{cn|date=December 2017}} However, during the [[West German federal election, 1949|1949 elections]] a number of National Socialist advocates such as [[Fritz Rössler]] had infiltrated the national conservative ''[[Deutsche Rechtspartei]]'', which had 5 members elected. Rössler and others left to found the more radical [[Socialist Reich Party]] under [[Otto Ernst Remer]]. At the onset of the [[Cold War]], the SRP favoured the Soviet Union over the United States.&lt;ref name="remer"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v10/v10p108_Schoeman.html|publisher=[[Institute for Historical Review]]|title=An Interview With General Otto Ernst Remer|date=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Austria]] national independence had been restored, and the ''[[Verbotsgesetz 1947]]'' explicitly criminalised the NSDAP and any attempt at restoration. 
West Germany adopted a similar law to target parties it defined as anti-constitutional; Article 21 Paragraph 2 in the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]], banning the Socialist Reich Party in 1952 for being opposed to [[liberal democracy]].

As a consequence some members of the nascent movement of German neo-Nazism joined the ''[[Deutsche Reichspartei]]'' of which [[Hans-Ulrich Rudel]] was the most prominent figure. Younger members founded the ''[[Wiking-Jugend]]'' modeled after the [[Hitler Youth]]. The ''Deutsche Reichspartei'' stood for elections from 1953 until 1961 fetching around 1% of the vote each time.{{cn|date=December 2017}} Rudel befriended French-born [[Savitri Devi]], who was a proponent of [[Esoteric Nazism]]. In the 1950s she wrote a number of books, such as ''[[Pilgrimage (book)|Pilgrimage]]'' (1958), which concerns prominent Third Reich sites, and ''[[The Lightning and the Sun]]'' (1958), in which she claims that Adolf Hitler was an avatar of the God [[Vishnu]]. She was not alone in this reorientation of National Socialism towards its [[Thule Society|Thulean]]-roots; the ''[[Artgemeinschaft]]'', founded by former SS member Wilhelm Kusserow, attempted to promote a new [[paganism]].{{cn|date=December 2017}} 
In the [[German Democratic Republic]] a former member of [[Sturmabteilung|SA]], [[Wilhelm Adam]], founded the [[National Democratic Party of Germany (East Germany)]]. It reached out to those attracted by the Nazi Party before 1945 and provide them with a political outlet, so that they would not be tempted to support the far-right again or turn to the anti-communist Western Allies.{{cn|date=December 2017}} Stalin wanted to use them to create a new pro-Soviet and anti-Western strain in German politics.{{cn|date=December 2017}} According to top Soviet diplomat Vladimir Semyonov, Stalin even suggested that they could be allowed to continue publishing their own newspaper, [[Völkischer Beobachter]]. While in Austria, former SS member Wilhelm Lang founded an esoteric group known as the [[Landig Group|Vienna Lodge]]; he popularised [[nazism and occultism]] such as the [[Black Sun (occult symbol)|Black Sun]] and ideas of Third Reich survival colonies below the polar ice caps.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

With the onset of the [[Cold War]] the allied forces had lost interest in prosecuting anyone as part of the denazification.&lt;ref name="Evans-2008"&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Evans |first=Richard J. |authorlink=Richard J. Evans |year=2008 |title=The Third Reich at War |series=The Third Reich Trilogy |publisher=Penguin Books |pages=747–748 |isbn=978-0-14-311671-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1950s this new political environment allowed [[Otto Strasser]], an NS activist on the left of the NSDAP, who had founded the [[Black Front]] to return from exile. In 1956, Strasser founded the [[German Social Union (West Germany)|German Social Union]] as a Black Front successor, promoting a [[Strasserite]] "nationalist and socialist" policy, which dissolved in 1962 due to lack of support. Other Third Reich associated groups were the [[HIAG]] and [[Stille Hilfe]] dedicated to advancing the interests of [[Waffen-SS]] veterans and rehabilitating them into the new democratic society. However, they did not claim to be attempting to restore National Socialism, instead working with the [[social democrats]] and [[Christian democrats]].

Many bureaucrats who served under the Third Reich continued to serve in German administration after the war. According to the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]], many of the more than 90,000 Nazi war criminals recorded in German files were serving in positions of prominence under Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]].&lt;ref name="Simon Wiesenthal Center"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&amp;b=4441293 |title=About Simon Wiesenthal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2013 |website=Simon Wiesenthal Center |accessdate=17 November 2013 |at=Section 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hartmann"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sopos.org/aufsaetze/4bdfd55e42f57/1.phtml |title=Der Alibiprozeß |publisher=Ossietzky 9/2010 |work=Den Aufsatz kommentieren |year=2010 |accessdate=19 November 2013 |last=Hartmann |first=Ralph |language=German |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222254/http://www.sopos.org/aufsaetze/4bdfd55e42f57/1.phtml |archivedate=2 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Not until the 1960s were the former concentration camp personnel prosecuted by [[West Germany]] in the [[Belzec trial]], [[Frankfurt Auschwitz trials]], [[Treblinka trials]], [[Chełmno trials]], and the [[Sobibór trial]].&lt;ref name="Rückerl-1972"&gt;{{Cite book |ref=harv |last=Rückerl |first=Adalbert |year=1972 |title=NS-Prozesse |publisher=Verlag C F Muller |location=Karlsruhe, Germany |url=https://books.google.com/?id=K23zAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Adalbert+R%C3%BCckerl%2C+NS-Prozesse.+Verlag+C+F+Muller%2C+1972&amp;q=Treblinka |accessdate=8 September 2013 |quote=Adalbert Rückerl, head of the Central Bureau for the Prosecution of National Socialist Crimes observed that because of the 1968 Dreher's amendment (§ 50 StGB), 90% of all Nazi war criminals in Germany enjoyed total immunity from prosecution. |page=132 |isbn=9783788020156 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the government had passed laws prohibiting National Socialists from publicly expressing their beliefs.

==="Universal National Socialism", 1950s–1970s===
Neo-Nazism found expression outside of Germany, including in countries who fought against the Third Reich during the Second World War, and sometimes adopted Pan-European or "Universal" characteristics, beyond the parameters of [[German nationalism]].{{cn|date=December 2017}} The two main tendencies, with differing styles and even worldviews, were the followers of the American [[Francis Parker Yockey]], who was fundamentally anti-American and advocated for a [[Pan-European nationalism]] and those of [[George Lincoln Rockwell]] an [[American conservative]].&lt;ref group= "nb"&gt;Some of the fascistic old-guard from the pre-war ultra-nationalist movements were more skeptical of the benefits of the Rockwell-Jordan uniform scene. [[Oswald Mosley]] of the [[Union Movement]] described Jordan as, "a midget trying to walk in the boots of giants." Meanwhile, Yockeyism leaned more to the left than the "official" fascistic Pan-Europeanism of those which would become the [[European Social Movement]]. The latter associated with Mosley, [[Maurice Bardèche]] and others upheld a strictly "neither East, nor West", third position in regards to Soviet and American power.&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=December 2017}}

Yockey, a neo-Spenglerian author, had written ''Imperium: The Philosophy of History and Politics'' (1949) dedicated to "the hero of the twentieth century" (namely, Adolf Hitler) and founded the [[European Liberation Front]]. He was interested more in the destiny of Europe; to this end, he advocated a [[National Bolshevik]]-esque [[Red–green–brown alliance|red-brown alliance]] against [[American culture]] and influenced 1960s figures such as SS-veteran [[Jean-François Thiriart]]. Yockey was also fond of [[Arab nationalism]], in particular [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], as well as this he saw [[Fidel Castro]]'s  [[Cuban Revolution]] as a positive and visited officials there. Yockey's views impressed Otto Ernst Remer and the radical traditionalist philosopher [[Julius Evola]]. He was constantly hounded by the [[FBI]] and was eventually arrested in 1960, before committing suicide. Domestically, Yockey's biggest sympathisers were the [[National Renaissance Party (United States)|National Renaissance Party]], including [[James H. Madole]], [[H. Keith Thompson]] and [[Eustace Mullins]] (''protégé'' of [[Ezra Pound]]) and the [[Liberty Lobby]] of [[Willis Carto]].{{cn|date=December 2017}}

Rockwell, an American conservative, was first politicised by [[anti-communism]] and opposed to [[racial integration]], before becoming [[anti-Jewish]]. In response to his opponents calling him a "Nazi", he theatrically appropriated the aesthetic elements of the NSDAP, to "own" the intended insult. In 1959, Rockwell founded the [[American Nazi Party]] and instructed his members to dress in imitation [[Sturmabteilung|SA]]-style brown shirts, while flying the flag of the Third Reich. In contrast to Yockey, he was pro-American and cooperated with FBI requests, despite the party being targeted under [[COINTELPRO]] due to the mistaken belief that they were agents of Nasser's Egypt during a brief intelligence "brown scare."&lt;ref group= "nb"&gt;While the intelligence claims in regards to the Rockwell's American costume group proved unfounded, a number of actual German National Socialists did relocate to the Middle East, some conveted to Islam and changed their names; particularly Egypt and Syria. This includes [[Johann von Leers]], [[Alois Brunner]], [[Aribert Heim]], [[Franz Stangl]], [[Gerhard Mertins]], [[Hans Eisele (physician)|Hans Eisele]], [[Walter Rauff]], [[Artur Schmitt]] and others. The father of Neo-Nazism, Otto Ernst Remer, also fled to Egypt, then Syria during the 1950s.&lt;/ref&gt; Later leaders of American [[white nationalism]] came to politics through the ANP; including a teenage [[David Duke]] and [[William Luther Pierce]] of the [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]], although they soon distanced themselves from explicit self-identification with neo-Nazism.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

[[File:Flag of Ordine Nuovo.svg|thumb|right|175px|The Italian group [[Ordine Nuovo]], banned in 1974, drew influence from the [[Waffen-SS]] and [[Traditionalist School|Guénonian Traditionalism]] via [[Julius Evola]].]]
[[File:Flag of the Order of Flemish Militants.svg|thumb|right|175px|The radicalisation of Flemish activist group the [[Vlaamse Militanten Orde]] in the 1970s, energised international neo-Nazism.]]

In 1961,  the [[World Union of National Socialists]] was founded by Rockwell and [[Colin Jordan]] of the British [[National Socialist Movement (UK, 1962)|National Socialist Movement]], adopting the ''[[Cotswold Declaration]].'' French socialite [[Françoise Dior]] was involved romantically with Jordan and his deputy [[John Tyndall (politician)|John Tyndall]] and  a friend of Savitri Devi, who also attended the meeting. The National Socialist Movement wore quasi-SA uniforms,  was involved in streets conflicts with the Jewish [[62 Group]]. In the 1970s, Tyndall's earlier involvement with neo-Nazism would come back to haunt the [[National Front (UK)|National Front]], which he led, as they attempted to ride a wave of anti-immigration populism and concerns over British national decline. Televised exposes on ''[[This Week (Thames Television TV series)|This Week]]'' in 1974 and ''[[World in Action]]'' in 1978, showed their neo-Nazi pedigree and damaged their electoral chances. In 1967, Rockwell was killed by a disgruntled former member. [[Matthias Koehl]] took control of the ANP, and strongly influenced by Savitri Devi, gradually transformed it into an esoteric group known as the [[New Order (Neo-Nazi group)|New Order]].{{cn|date=December 2017}}

In [[Franco's Spain]], certain SS refugees most notably [[Otto Skorzeny]], [[Léon Degrelle]] and the son of [[Klaus Barbie]] became associated with [[CEDADE]] (''Círculo Español de Amigos de Europa''), an organisation which disseminated Third Reich apologetics out of [[Barcelona]]. They intersected with neo-Nazi advocates from [[Mark Fredriksen]] in France to [[Salvador Borrego]] in [[Mexico]]. 
In the post-fascist [[Italian Social Movement]] splinter groups such as [[Ordine Nuovo]] and [[Avanguardia Nazionale]], involved in the "[[Years of Lead (Italy)|Years of Lead]]" considered National Socialism a reference. [[Franco Freda]] created a "Nazi-[[Maoist]]" synthesis. 

In Germany itself, the various Third Reich nostalgic movements coalesced around the [[National Democratic Party of Germany]] in 1964 and in Austria the [[National Democratic Party (Austria, 1967–88)|National Democratic Party]] in 1967 as the primary sympathisers of the NSDAP past, although more publicly cautious than earlier groups.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

===Holocaust denial and subcultures, 1970s–1990s===
[[Holocaust denial]], the claim that [[the Holocaust|six million Jews]] were not deliberately and systematically exterminated as an official policy of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] and [[Adolf Hitler]], became a more prominent feature of neo-Nazism in the 1970s. Before this time, Holocaust denial had long existed as a sentiment among neo-Nazis, but it had not yet been systematically articulated as a theory with a bibliographical canon. Few of the major theorists of Holocaust denial (who call themselves "[[Historical revisionism|revisionists]]") can be uncontroversially classified as outright neo-Nazis (though some works such as those of [[David Irving]] forward a clearly sympathetic view of Hitler and the publisher [[Ernst Zündel]] was deeply tied to international neo-Nazism), however, the main interest of Holocaust denial to neo-Nazis was their hope that it would help them rehabilitate their political [[ideology]] in the eyes of the general public. ''[[Did Six Million Really Die?]]'' (1974) by [[Richard Verrall]] and ''[[The Hoax of the Twentieth Century]]'' (1976) by [[Arthur Butz]] are popular examples of Holocaust denial material.

Key developments in international neo-Nazism during this time include the radicalisation of the ''[[Vlaamse Militanten Orde]]'' under former [[Hitler Youth]] member [[Bert Eriksson]]. They began hosting an annual conference; the "Iron Pilgrimage"; at [[Diksmuide]], which drew kindred ideologues from across Europe and beyond. As well as this, the [[NSDAP/AO (1972)|NSDAP/AO]] under [[Gary Lauck]] arose in the United States in 1972 and challenged the international influence of the Rockwellite WUNS. Lauck's organisation drew support from the [[National Socialist Movement of Denmark]] of [[Povl Riis-Knudsen]] and various German and Austrian figures who felt that the "National Democratic" parties were too bourgeois and insufficiently National Socialist in orientation. This included [[Michael Kühnen]], [[Christian Worch]], [[Bela Ewald Althans]] and [[Gottfried Küssel]] of the 1977-founded  [[Action Front of National Socialists/National Activists|ANS/NS]] which called for the establishment of a Germanic [[Fourth Reich]]. Some ANS/NS members were imprisoned for planning paramilitary attacks on [[NATO]] bases in Germany and planning to liberate [[Rudolf Hess]] from [[Spandau Prison]]. The organisation was officially banned in 1983 by the Minister of the Interior.

During the late 1970s, a British subculture came to be associated with neo-Nazism; the [[skinheads]]. Portraying an ultra-masculine, crude and aggressive image, with working-class references, some of the skinheads joined the [[British Movement]] under [[Michael McLaughlin]] (successor of [[Colin Jordan]]), while others became associated with the National Front's [[Rock Against Communism]] project which was meant to counter the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|SWP]]'s [[Rock Against Racism]]. The most significant music group involved in this project was [[Skrewdriver]], led by [[Ian Stuart Donaldson]]. Together with ex-BM member [[Nicky Crane]], Donaldson founded the international [[Blood &amp; Honour]] network in 1987. By 1992 this network, with input from [[Harold Covington]], had developed a paramilitary wing; [[Combat 18]], which intersected with [[football hooligan]] firms such as the [[Chelsea Headhunters]]. The neo-Nazi skinhead movement spread to the United States, with groups such as the [[Hammerskins]]. It was popularised from 1986 onwards by [[Tom Metzger]] of the [[White Aryan Resistance]]. Since then it has spread across the world. Films such as ''[[Romper Stomper]]'' (1992) and ''[[American History X]]'' (1998) would fix a public perception that [[white power skinheads|neo-Nazism and skinheads]] were synonymous.

[[Image:Black_Sun_2.svg|thumb|175px|left|Serrano identified Aryan-Hyperborean blood as the "light of the [[Black Sun (occult symbol)|Black Sun]]", a symbol found at SS-cult site [[Wewelsburg|Wewelsburg Castle]].]]

New developments also emerged on the esoteric level, as former Chilean diplomat [[Miguel Serrano]] built on the works of [[Carl Jung]], [[Otto Rahn]], [[Wilhelm Landig]], [[Julius Evola]] and [[Savitri Devi]] to bind together and develop already existing theories. Serrano had been a member of the [[National Socialist Movement of Chile]] in the 1930s and from the early days of neo-Nazism he had been in contact with key figures across Europe and beyond. Despite this, he was able to work as an ambassador to numerous countries until the rise of [[Salvador Allende]]. In 1984 he published his book ''Adolf Hitler: The Ultimate Avatar''. Serrano claimed that the Aryans were extragalactic beings who founded [[Hyperborea]] and lived the heroic life of [[Bodhisattvas]], while the [[Jews]] were created by the [[Demiurge]] and were concerned only with coarse [[materialism]]. Serrano claimed that a new [[Golden Age]] can be attained if the Hyperboreans repurify their blood (supposedly the light of the Black Sun) and restore their "[[Genetic memory (psychology)|blood-memory]]." As with Savitri Devi before him, Serrano's works became a key point of reference in neo-Nazism.

===Lifting of the Iron Curtain, 1990s–present===
With the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] and the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] during the early 1990s, neo-Nazism began to spread its ideas in the East, as hostility to the triumphant liberal order was high and [[revanchism]] a widespread feeling. In Russia, during the chaos of the early 1990s, an amorphous mixture of [[KGB]] hardliners, Orthodox neo-Tsarist nostalgics (i.e. - [[Pamyat]]) and explicit National Socialists found themselves strewn together in the same camp. They were united by opposition to the influence of the United States, against the liberalising legacy of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s ''[[perestroika]]'' and on the [[Jewish question]], [[Soviet Anti-Zionism|Soviet Zionology]] merged with a more explicit anti-Jewish sentiment. The most significant organisation representing this was [[Russian National Unity]] under the leadership of [[Alexander Barkashov]], where black-uniform clad Russians marched with a red flag incorporating the [[Swastika]] under the banner of ''[[Russia for Russians]].'' These forces came together in a last gasp effort to save the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia]] against [[Boris Yeltsin]] during the [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis]]. As well as events in Russia, in newly independent ex-Soviet states, annual commemorations for SS volunteers now took place; particularly in [[Remembrance day of the Latvian legionnaires|Latvia]], [[20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian)|Estonia]] and the [[14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Galician)|Ukraine]].

[[Image:Evstafiev-neo-bolsheviks.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Members of the [[National Bolshevik Party]]. The Nazbols tailored ultra-nationalist themes to a native Russian environment, while still flirting with National Socialist aesthetics.]]

The Russian developments excited German neo-Nazism who dreamed of a [[Berlin]]—[[Moscow]] alliance against the supposedly "decadent" [[Atlanticist]] forces; a dream which had been thematic since the days of Remer.&lt;ref name="remer"/&gt; Zündel visited Russia and met with Russian National Unity luminaries such as ex-KGB general Aleksandr Stergilov. Despite these initial aspirations, international neo-Nazism and its close affiliates in ultra-nationalism would be split over the [[Bosnian War]] between 1992 and 1995, as part of the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]]. The split would largely be along ethnic and sectarian lines. The Germans and the French would largely back the Western Catholic [[Croats]] (Lauck's NSDAP/AO explicitly [[Foreign fighters in the Bosnian War|called for volunteers]], which Kühnen's [[Free German Workers' Party]] answered and the French formed the "Groupe [[Jacques Doriot]]"), while the Russians and the Greeks would back the Orthodox [[Serbs]] (including Russians from Barkashov's Russian National Unity, [[Eduard Limonov]]'s [[National Bolshevik Party|National Bolshevik Front]] and [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]] members joined the [[Greek Volunteer Guard]]). Indeed, the revival of [[National Bolshevism]] was able to steal some of the thunder from overt Russian neo-Nazism, as ultra-nationalism was wedded with veneration of [[Joseph Stalin]] in place of Adolf Hitler, while still also flirting with National Socialist aesthetics.

==Analogous European movements==
Outside Germany, in other countries which were involved with the [[Axis powers]] and had their own native ultra-nationalist movements, which sometimes collaborated with the Third Reich but were not technically German-style National Socialists, revivalist and nostalgic movements have emerged in the post-war period which, as neo-Nazism has done in Germany, seek to rehabilitate their various loosely associated ideologies. These movements include [[neo-fascists]] and [[post-fascists]] in Italy; Vichyites, Pétainists and "national Europeans" in France; [[Ustaše]] sympathisers in [[Croatia]]; neo-[[Chetniks]] in [[Serbia]]; [[Iron Guard]] revivalists in [[Romania]]; [[Hungarists]] and [[Miklós Horthy|Horthyists]] in [[Hungary]]; [[Stepan Bandera|Banderaists]] in the [[Ukraine]] (which had a complicated relationship with the Axis powers) and others.

===Italy===
[[File:Junio Valerio Borghese.jpg|thumb|187px|The nearest Italy came to returning to [[fascism]] was the 1970 [[Golpe Borghese]] of commando veteran [[Junio Valerio Borghese]].]]

Following the last stand of [[Italian fascism]] with the German-supported [[Italian Social Republic]] towards the end of the Second World War, those elements within Italian society which remained loyal to the legacy of [[Benito Mussolini]] and fascism (especially veterans of the [[National Republican Army]]), rejecting both the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Catholic]] and [[Italian Communist Party|Communist]] alternatives prominent in mainstream Italian politics, founded the [[Italian Social Movement]] in 1946 under [[Giorgio Almirante]]. The MSI was regarded as the successor of the [[National Fascist Party]] and the [[Republican Fascist Party]]. The motto of the party was "not repudiate, not restore", indicating a more moderate parliamentary democratic [[neo-fascism]], which did not heap scorn on the recent past. Italian society did not undergo a process as extensive as the post-war Denazification campaign in occupied Germany, partly due to the [[Cold War]] and the Western Allies not wanting Italy to move towards the [[Warsaw Pact]] (which was not an [[Popular Democratic Front (Italy)|impossibility at the time]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Alessandra Kersevan]]2008: (Editor) Foibe - Revisionismo di stato e amnesie della repubblica.

The Italian Social Movement held a similar position in Italian politics that the [[National Democratic Party of Germany]] did in Germany; careful enough to stay within the laws of the new democratic state, but still clearly identified with the Axis legacy. During the 1950s, the MSI moved closer to bourgeois conservative politics on the domestic front, which led to radical youths founding hardline splinter groups, such as [[Pino Rauti]]'s [[Ordine Nuovo]] (later succeeded by [[Ordine Nero]]) and  [[Stefano Delle Chiaie]]'s [[National Vanguard (Italy)|Avanguardia Nazionale]]. These organisations were influenced by the esotericism of [[Julius Evola]] and considered the Waffen-SS and Romanian leader [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]] a reference, moving beyond Italian fascism. They were implicated in [[Years of Lead (Italy)|paramiliary attacks]] during the late 1960s to the early 1980s, such as the [[Piazza Fontana bombing]]. Delle Chiaie had even assisted [[Junio Valerio Borghese]] in a failed 1970 coup attempt known as the [[Golpe Borghese]], which attempted to reinstate a fascist state in Italy.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Italian Social Movement under the leadership of [[Gianfranco Fini]] moved closer to conservative politics, adopting a "post-fascist" position. This was opposed by the fascist element under Rauti who created [[Fiamma Tricolore]] in 1995. The party was dissolved under Fini in 1995, who replaced it with the [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]]. This party rapidly moved away from any connection to the fascist past, towards the center-right in coalition with [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s [[Forza Italia]]. The two parties merged in 2009 to become [[The People of Freedom]]. [[Alessandra Mussolini]], troubled by Fini's explicit condemnation of her grandfather broke with the AN to found [[Social Action]]. Aside from Fiamma Tricolore, the other extant neo-fascist groups in Italy are [[New Force (Italy)|Forza Nuova]], the [[National Social Front|Fronte Nazionale]], [[Social Idea Movement|Movimento Idea Sociale]] (another Rauti creation) and the cultural ''[[CasaPound]]'' project. In terms of current size, they are mostly negligible.

In France, the most enthusiastic collaborationists during the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupation of France]] had been the [[National Popular Rally]] of [[Marcel Déat]] (former [[French Section of the Workers' International|SFIO]] members) and the [[French Popular Party]] of [[Jacques Doriot]] (former [[French Communist Party]] members). These two groups, like the Germans, saw themselves as combining ultra-nationalism and [[socialism]]. In the south there existed the vassal state of [[Vichy France]] under the military "Hero of the Verdun", Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]] whose ''[[Révolution nationale]]'' emphasised an authoritarian Catholic conservative politics. Following the [[liberation of France]] and the creation of the [[Fourth French Republic]], collaborationists were prosecuted during the ''[[épuration légale]]'' and nearly 800 put to death for treason under [[Charles de Gaulle]].

In the aftermath of the Second World War, the main concern of the French radical right was the collapse of the [[French colonial empire|French Empire]], in particular the [[Algerian War]], which led to the creation of the [[Organisation armée secrète|OAS]]. Outside of this, individual fascistic activists such as [[Maurice Bardèche]] (brother-in-law of [[Robert Brasillach]]), as well as SS-veterans [[Marc Augier|Saint-Loup]] and [[René Binet (neo-Fascist)|René Binet]],  were active in France and involved in the [[European Social Movement]] and later the [[New European Order]], alongside similar groups from across Europe. Early neo-fascist groups included [[Jeune Nation]], which introduced the [[Celtic cross]] into use by radical right groups (an association which would spread internationally). A "neither East, nor West" pan-Europeanism was most popular among French fascistic activists until the late 1960s, partly motivated by feelings of national vulnerability following the collapse of their empire; thus the Belgian SS-veteran [[Jean-François Thiriart]]'s group [[Jeune Europe]] also had a considerable French contingent.

It was the 1960s, during the [[Fifth French Republic]], that a considerable upturn in French neo-fascism occurred; some of it in response to the [[Protests of 1968]]. The most explicitly pro-Nazi of these was the [[Fédération d'action nationale et européenne|FANE]] of [[Mark Fredriksen]]. Neo-fascist groups included [[Pierre Sidos]]' [[Occident (movement)|Occident]], the [[Ordre Nouveau (1960s)|Ordre Nouveau]] (which was banned after violent clashes with the Trotskyist [[Revolutionary Communist League (France)|LCR]]) and the student-based [[Groupe Union Défense]]. A number of these activists such as [[François Duprat]] were instrumental in founding the [[National Front (France)|Front National]] under [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]]; but the FN also included a broader selection from the French hard-right, including not only these neo-fascist elements, but also [[Integrism|Catholic integrists]], monarchists, Algerian War veterans, [[Poujadists]] and national-conservatives. Others from these neo-fascist micro-groups formed the [[Parti des forces nouvelles]] working against Le Pen.

Within the FN itself, Duprat founded the FANE-backed [[Revolutionary Nationalist Groups|Groupes nationalistes révolutionnaires]] faction, until his 1978 assassination. The subsequent history of the French hard right has been the conflict between the national-conservative controlled FN and "national revolutionary" (fascistic and National Bolshevik) splinter or opposition groups. The latter include groups in the tradition of Thiriart and Duprat, such as the [[Parti communautaire national-européen]], [[Troisième voie]], the [[Nouvelle Résistance]] of [[Christian Bouchet]],&lt;ref name=Banquet&gt;[http://www.revue-lebanquet.com/docs/a_0000362.html Stratégies et pratiques du mouvement nationaliste-révolutionnaire français : départs, desseins et destin d'Unité Radicale (1989–2002)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929082901/http://www.revue-lebanquet.com/docs/a_0000362.html |date=29 September 2007 }}, ''Le Banquet,'' n°19, 2004 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Unité Radicale]] and most recently [[Bloc identitaire]].

===Hungary===
[[File:Becsület napja 1997-02-15.jpg|thumb|250px|"Hungaria Skins" with a flag evoking the Arrow Cross in 1997.|left]]

In Hungary, the historical political party which allied itself ideologically with German National Socialism and drew inspiration from it, was the [[Arrow Cross Party]] of [[Ferenc Szálasi]]. They referred to themselves explicitly as National Socialists and within Hungarian politics this tendency is known as [[Hungarism]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} After the Second World War, exiles such as [[Árpád Henney]] kept the Hungarist tradition alive. Following the fall of the [[Hungarian People's Republic]] in 1989, which was a [[Marxist-Leninist]] state and a member of the [[Warsaw Pact]], many new parties emerged. Amongst these was the [[Hungarian National Front]] of [[István Győrkös]], which was a Hungarist party and considered itself the heirs of Arrow Cross-style National Socialism (a self-description they explicitly embraced);{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} it forged links with [[Gottfried Küssel]] and the NSDAP/AO.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In the 2000s, Győrkös' movement moved closer to a [[national communist]] and [[neo-Eurasian]] position, aligned with [[Aleksandr Dugin]], cooperating with the [[Hungarian Workers' Party]]. Some Hungarists opposed this and founded the [[Pax Hungarica Movement]]. 

In modern Hungary, the ultranationalist [[Jobbik]] is regarded by some scholars as a neo-Nazi party; for example, it has been termed as such by [[Randolph L. Braham]].&lt;ref&gt;Randolph L. Braham, "Hungary: The Assault on the Historical Memory of the Holocaust" in ''The Holocaust in Hungary: Seventy Years Later'' (eds. Randolph L. Braham &amp; András Kovács:  Central European University Press, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The party denies being neo-Nazi, although "there is extensive proof that the leading members of the party made no effort to hide their racism and anti-Semitism."&lt;ref name="Spectrum"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hungarianspectrum.org/2013/04/08/jobbik-is-not-a-neo-nazi-party-at-least-not-according-to-a-hungarian-judge/|publisher=Hungarian Spectrum|title=Jobbik is not a neo-Nazi party. At least not according to a Hungarian judge|work=Hungarian Spectrum|date=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rudolf Paksa, a scholar of the Hungarian far right, describes Jobbik as "anti-Semitic, racist, homophobic and chauvinistic" but not as neo-Nazi because it does not pursue the establishment of a totalitarian regime.&lt;ref name="Spectrum"/&gt; Historian [[Krisztián Ungváry]] writes that "It is safe to say that certain messages of Jobbik can be called open neo-Nazi propaganda. However, it is quite certain that the popularity of the party is not due to these statements."&lt;ref&gt;Krisztián Ungváry, "'One Camp, One Banner': How Fidesz Views History" in ''Twenty-Five Sides of a Post-Communist Mafia State'' (ed. Balint Magyar &amp; Julia Vasarhelyi: Central European University Press, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romania===
In Romania, the ultra-nationalist movement which allied itself with the [[Axis powers]] and German National Socialism was the [[Iron Guard]], also known as the Legion of the Archangel Michael. There are some modern political organisations which consider themselves heirs of Legionarism, this includes [[Noua Dreaptă]] and the [["Everything For the Country" Party]], founded by former Iron Guard members. The latter organisation was outlawed in 2015. Aside, from these Romanian organisations, the [[Sixty-Four Counties Youth Movement]] representing ultra-nationalism from the Hungarian minority is also present, especially in [[Transylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Luiza Ilie |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-romania-prosecutors-blast-idUSKBN0TK4YD20151201 |title=Romanian prosecutors arrest suspect for attempted blast |newspaper=Reuters |accessdate=2016-02-26|date= December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other nationalistic and irridentist groups such as the [[Greater Romania Party]] do not originate from Legionarism, but in fact grew out of [[national communist]] tendencies from the era of [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] (the party was founded by his "court poet" [[Corneliu Vadim Tudor]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Markéta Smrčková |url=http://www.cepsr.com/clanek.php?ID=360 |title=Comparison of Radical Right-Wing Parties in Bulgaria and Romania |publisher=Central European Political Studies Review |accessdate=2016-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
===Ex-Nazis in mainstream politics===
[[Image:Kurt Waldheim 1971b.jpg|thumb|right|187px|The 1980s dispute between Austrian president [[Kurt Waldheim]] and the [[World Jewish Congress]] caused an international incident.]]

The most significant case on an international level was the election of [[Kurt Waldheim]] to the Presidency of Austria in 1986. It came to light that Waldheim had been a member of the [[National Socialist German Students' League]], the SA and served as an intelligence officer during the Second World War. Following this he served as an Austrian diplomat and was the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] from 1972 until 1981. After revelations of Waldheim's past were made by an Austrian journalist, Waldheim clashed with the [[World Jewish Congress]] on the international stage. Waldheim's record was defended by [[Bruno Kreisky]], an Austrian Jew who served as Chancellor of Austria. The legacy of the affair lingers on, as [[Victor Ostrovsky]] has claimed the [[Mossad]] doctored the file of Waldheim to implicate him in war crimes.

===Contemporary right-wing populism===
Some critics have sought to draw a connection between Nazism and modern [[right-wing populism]] in Europe, but the two are not widely regarded as interchangeable by most academics. In Austria, the [[Freedom Party of Austria]] (FPÖ) served as a shelter for ex-Nazis almost from its inception.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In 1980, scandals undermined Austria's two main parties and the economy stagnated. [[Jörg Haider]] became leader of the FPÖ and offered partial justification for [[Nazism]], calling its employment policy effective. In the [[Austrian legislative election, 1994|1994 Austrian election]], the FPÖ won 22 percent of the vote, as well as 33 percent of the vote in [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] and 22 percent in Vienna; showing that it had become a force capable of reversing the old pattern of Austrian politics.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter, ''Fascism: Past, Present, Future'', pp. 80, 116, 117&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Walter Laqueur]] writes that even though Haider welcomed former Nazis at his meetings and went out of his way to address [[Schutzstaffel]] (SS) veterans, the FPÖ is not a fascist party in the traditional sense, since it has not made [[anti-communism]] an important issue, and it does not advocate the overthrow of the democratic order or the use of violence. In his view, the FPÖ is "not quite fascist", although it is part of a tradition, similar to that of 19th-century Viennese mayor [[Karl Lueger]], which involves [[nationalism]], xenophobic populism, and [[authoritarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter, ''Fascism: Past, Present, Future'', p. 117-118&lt;/ref&gt; Haider, who in 2005 left the Freedom Party and formed the [[Alliance for Austria's Future]], was killed in a traffic accident in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7664846.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Austria's Haider dies in accident | date=2008-10-11 | accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barbara Rosenkranz]], the Freedom Party's candidate for the [[Austrian presidential election, 2010]], is controversial for having made allegedly pro-Nazi statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8634796.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Austria spooked by Nazi past in election | date=2010-04-23 | accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenkranz is married to [[Horst Rosenkranz]], a key member of a banned neo-Nazi party, who is known for publishing far-right books. Rosenkranz says she cannot detect anything "dishonourable" in her husband's activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/reich-mother-on-the-march-in-hitlers-homeland-1953005.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Reich mother on the march in Hitler's homeland | date=2010-04-24 | accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Bloed, Bodem, Eer en Trouw}}
A Belgian neo-Nazi organization, [[Bloed, Bodem, Eer en Trouw]] (Blood, Soil, Honour and Loyalty), was created in 2004 after splitting from the international network ([[Blood and Honour]]). The group rose to public prominence in September 2006, after 17 members (including 11 soldiers) were arrested under the December 2003 [[Anti-terrorism legislation|anti-terrorist laws]] and laws against [[racism]], [[antisemitism]] and supporters of [[censorship]]. According to Justice Minister [[Laurette Onkelinx]] and Interior Minister [[Patrick Dewael]], the suspects (11 of whom were members of the military) were preparing to launch terrorist attacks in order to "destabilize" [[Belgium]].&lt;ref&gt;

====Bosnia and Herzegovina====
The neo-Nazi [[white nationalism|white nationalist]] organization Bosanski Pokret Nacionalnog Ponosa ([[Bosnian Movement of National Pride]]) was founded in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in July 2009.

The group's strongest area of operations is in the Tuzla area of Bosnia.

====Czech Republic====
The government of the [[Czech Republic]] strictly punishes neo-Nazism ([[Czech language|Czech]]: ''Neonacismus''). According to a report by the [[Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic]], neo-Nazis committed more than 211 crimes in 2013. The Czech Republic has various neo-Nazi groups. One of them is the group Wotan Jugend, based in Germany.

====Estonia====
In 2006, Roman Ilin, a Jewish theatre director from [[St. Petersburg]], [[Russia]], was attacked by neo-Nazis when returning from an underground tunnel after a rehearsal.

Following the failure of the [[National Democratic Party of Germany]] in the [[West German federal election, 1969|election of 1969]], small groups committed to the revival of Nazi ideology began to emerge in Germany.

The German intelligence services have been criticized for extravagant distributions of cash to informants within the far right movement. Tino Brandt publicly boasted on television that he had received around €100,000 in funding from the German state. Though Brandt did not give the state "useful information", the funding supported recruitment efforts in Thuringia during the early 1990s. (Brandt was eventually sentenced to five and a half years in prison on for 66 counts of [[child prostitution]] and [[child sexual abuse]]).&lt;ref name=meaney /&gt;  

Police were only able to locate the killers when they were tipped off following a botched bank robbery in [[Eisenach]]. As the police closed in on them, the two men committed [[suicide]]. They had evaded capture for 13 years. [[Beate Zschäpe]], who had been living with the two men in [[Zwickau]], turned herself in to the German authorities a few days later.  Zschäpe's trial began in May 2013; she was charged with nine counts of [[murder]]. She plead "not guilty". According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', the NSU may have enjoyed protection and support from certain "elements of the state". [[Anders Breivik]], a fan of Zschäpe's, reportedly sent her a letter from prison in 2012.&lt;ref name=meaney&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0261-3077| last1 = Meaney| first1 = Thomas| last2 = Schäfer| first2 = Saskia| title = The neo-Nazi murder trial revealing Germany's darkest secrets | work = The Guardian| accessdate = 2018-11-12| date = 2016-12-15| url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/15/neo-nazi-murders-revealing-germanys-darkest-secrets}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1967, a few weeks prior to an election, a military coup d'état took place in Greece and a fascist military government ruled the country from 1967 to 1974. It was called the "[[Greek military junta of 1967–74|Regime of the Colonels]]", and was headed by Colonel [[Georgios Papadopoulos]].

The [[far right]] political party [[Golden Dawn (Greece)|Golden Dawn]] (Χρυσή Αυγή - Chrysi Avyi) is generally labelled neo-Nazi, although the group rejects this label.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Helena |last=Smith |title=Rise of the Greek far right raises fears of further turmoil |newspaper=The Guardian |date=16 December 2011 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/16/rise-greek-far-right-turmoil |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few Golden Dawn members participated in the [[Bosnian War]] in the [[Greek Volunteer Guard]] (GVG) and were present in [[Srebrenica]] during the [[Srebrenica massacre#Non-Serb participants in the killings|Srebrenica massacre]].&lt;ref name="Michas"&gt;{{cite web |first=Michas |last=Takis |title=Unholy Alliance |publisher=[[Texas A&amp;M University]] Press: Eastern European Studies (College Station, Tex.) |page=22 |url=http://www.preventgenocide.org/edu/pastgenocides/formeryugoslavia/resources/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="srebr"&gt;[http://www.enet.gr/online/online_fpage_text?id=13996864,21821632,8195520%22 16/07/2005 article] in Eleftherotypia.

Since 2008, neo-Nazi violence in Greece has targeted [[Immigration to Greece|immigrants]], [[leftist]]s and [[anarchist]] activists.  In 2009, certain far right groups announced that [[Agios Panteleimonas, Athens|Agios Panteleimonas]] in [[Athens]] was off limits to immigrants.

====Hungary====
The [[Hungarian Guard]] is a neo-Nazi [[paramilitary]] organization in [[Hungary]]. The Guard was modelled on the [[Arrow Cross Party]], which participated in the murder of Jews and Gypsies during the Holocaust. It serves as a paramilitary force for the far right [[Jobbik party]]. Gypsy homes have been targeted by night time [[death squads]] who throw a [[molotov cocktail]] through the window and then open fire on the inhabitants as they flee their burning homes. The Chief of Police in [[Miskolc]] has made public statements that "Hungarian and Gypsy cultures can't mix".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 00107565| volume = 291| issue = 1694| pages = 280| last = Land| first = Thomas| title = Disappointed Eastern Europe Confronts Its Neo-Nazis| journal = Contemporary Review| date = 2009| via=[[EBSCOhost]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coordination Forum for Countering Antisemitism reports that on 17 May 2011 in [[Leek, Netherlands|Leek]], [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], antisemitic graffiti was found at a Jewish school. The graffiti consisted of a swastika and the text "C18", or [[Combat 18]], a neo-Nazi organisation active throughout Europe.

====Poland====
[[File:ONR poznan.jpg|thumb|250px|ONR march in [[Poznań]] in November 2015]]

Under the [[Polish Constitution]] promoting any totalitarian system such as [[Nazism]] and [[fascism]] (as well as [[communism]]) as well as inciting violence and/or racial hatred is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Polish Constitution]] (Dz.U. z 1997 r. Nr 78, poz. 483)&lt;/ref&gt; This was further re-enforced in the [[Polish Penal Code]] where discrediting any group or persons on national, religious, racial or religious grounds carries a sentence of 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;[[Polish Penal Code]] (Dz.U. z 2017 r. poz. 2204, z późn. zm.; Art 256 &amp; Art 257)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although several small far-right and anti-semitic organisations exist, most notably [[National Revival of Poland|NOP]] and [[National Radical Camp (1993)|ONR]] (both of which exist legally), they frequently adhere to [[Polish nationalism]] and [[National Democracy]], in which Nazism is generally considered to be against [[ultra-nationalism|ultra-nationalist]] principles, and although they are classed as [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and [[fascism|fascist]] movements, they are at the same time considered anti-Nazi. Some of their elements may resemble neo-Nazi features, but these groups frequently dissociate themselves from Nazi elements, claiming that such acts are unpatriotic and they argue that Nazism misappropriated or slightly altered several pre-existing symbols and features, such as distinguishing the [[Roman salute]] from the [[Nazi salute]].&lt;ref name="dziennik.pl(2008-06-21)"&gt;PAP (2008-06-21), [http://www.dziennik.pl/wydarzenia/article195823 Faszystowskie gesty w Myślenicach.]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Dziennik.pl'' Kraj. Retrieved 25 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-declared neo-nazi movements in Poland frequently treat Polish culture and traditions with contempt, are [[anti-Christian]] and translate various texts from German, meaning they are considered movements favouring [[Germanisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Olgierd Grott|title= Faszyści i narodowi socjaliści w Polsce| publisher= Nomos|location= Kraków|year= 2007 |page= 344|isbn= 978-83-60490-19-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

According to several reporter investigations the Polish government turns a blind eye to these groups and they are free to spread their ideology, frequently dismissing their existence as [[conspiracy theories]], dismissing acts political provocations, deeming them too insignificant to pose a threat, or [[Apologetics|attempting to justify or diminish the seriousness of their actions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://wiadomosci.wp.pl/polscy-neonazisci-zdemaskowani-sympatycy-pis-widza-w-tym-spisek-6212049554433665a | title=Polscy neonaziści zdemaskowani.

====Russia====
{{Main article|Racism in Russia|Radical nationalism in Russia}}

There are a few Russian neo-Nazis that openly admire [[Adolf Hitler]] and use the [[swastika]] as their symbol. Russian neo-Nazis are characterized by [[racism]], [[antisemitism]], [[homophobia]], [[Islamophobia]] and extreme [[xenophobia]] towards people from [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=4 mei 2008 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLUxuq-E9yA |title=Horrific Documentary on Russian Neo-Nazis part 1 |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their ideology centers on defending Russian national identity against what they perceive as a takeover by minority groups such as [[Jew]]s, [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasians]], gay people, [[Central Asia]]ns, [[East Asia]]ns, [[Romani people|Roma people]] (gypsies), and Muslims. There is also a widespread gay rights Nazi skinhead subculture with its own Vkontakte group, GASH, and an alleged 1700 members in Moscow alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/gr/read/meet-russias-gay-aryan-skinheads-finally-bringing-homosexuality-to-the-neo-nazi-world|title=An Interview with a Gay, Russian Neo-Nazi|website=Vice|date=2013-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Neo-Nazism in Russia (2010).jpg|thumb|187px|left|Neo-Nazism in Russia: The photograph was taken at an anti-gay demonstration in Moscow in October 2010]]

Russian neo-Nazis have made it an explicit goal to take over the country by force, and have put serious effort into preparing for this. [[Paramilitary]] organizations operating under the guise of sports clubs have trained their members in squad tactics, [[hand to hand combat]] and weapons handling. They have stockpiled and used weapons, often illegally.

Some observers have noted a subjective irony of Russians embracing Nazism, because one of Hitler's ambitions at the start of [[World War II]] was the [[Generalplan Ost]] (Master Plan East) which envisaged to exterminate, expel, or enslave most or all Slavs from central and eastern Europe (e.g., Russians, Ukrainians, Poles etc.).&lt;ref name=William1&gt;[[William W. Hagen]] (2012). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=zBgr3kL-PP4C&amp;pg=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false German History in Modern Times: Four Lives of the Nation]''. Cambridge University Press. p. 313. {{ISBN|0-521-19190-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian neo-Nazis deny the authenticity of this plan and instead emphasize the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|1939-1941 Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact]].&lt;ref name=William1 /&gt; At the end of the [[Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union]], over 25 million Soviet citizens had died.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/soviet_german_war_01.shtml The Soviet-German War 1941 - 1945]". BBC - History.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2007 news story, ''ABC News'' reported, "In a country that lost more people defeating the Nazis than any other country, there are now an estimated 50,000 to 70,000 neo-Nazis, half of the world's total."&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=3718255&amp;page=1 "Violence 'in the Name of the Nation'"]. ''[[ABC News]]''. October 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 caused great economic and social problems, including widespread [[unemployment]] and [[poverty]]. Several [[far right]] [[paramilitary]] organizations were able to tap into popular discontent, particularly among marginalized, lesser educated and unemployed youths. Of the three major age groups — youths, adults, and the elderly — youths may have been hit the hardest. The elderly suffered due to inadequate (or unpaid) pensions, but they found effective political representation in the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|Communist Party]], and generally had their concerns addressed through better budget allocations. Adults, although often suffering financially and psychologically due to job losses, were generally able to find new sources of income.

[[Russian National Unity]] (RNE), founded in 1990 and led by [[Alexander Barkashov]], has claimed to have members in 250 cities. RNE adopted the swastika as its symbol, and sees itself as the avant-garde of a coming national revolution. It is critical of other major far right organizations, such as the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]] (LDPR). Historian Walter Laqueur calls RNE far closer to the Nazi model than the LDPR. RNE publishes several news sheets; one of them, ''Russky poryadok'', claims to have a circulation of 150,000. Full members of RNE are called Soratnik (comrades in arms), receive combat training at locations near Moscow, and many of them work as security officers or armed guards.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter, ''Fascism: Past, Present, Future'', p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 August 2007, Russian authorities arrested a student for allegedly posting a video on the Internet which appears to show two migrant workers being beheaded in front of a red and black swastika flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6946810.stm |title=Russian held over 'deaths' video |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-08-15 |accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander Verkhovsky, the head of a Moscow-based center that monitors [[hate crime]] in Russia, said, "It looks like this is the real thing. The killing is genuine ... There are similar videos from the Chechen war. But this is the first time the killing appears to have been done intentionally."&lt;ref name="execution"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/russia/article/0,,2149611,00.html|title=Student arrested over Russian neo-Nazi 'execution' video|author=Luke Harding|publisher=The Guardian|date=2007-08-16|accessdate=2007-08-16 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sweden====
Neo-Nazi activities in [[Sweden]] have previously been limited to [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] groups, few of which have a membership over a few hundred members.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter, ''Fascism: Past, Present, Future'', p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; The main neo-Nazi organization as of 2017 is the [[Nordic Resistance Movement]]. Nordic Resistance Movement self-identifies as a [[National Socialist]] political movement with a parliamentary branch. They are also active in [[Norway]], [[Finland]], and [[Denmark]].

====Switzerland====

The neo-Nazi and [[white power skinhead]] scene in Switzerland has seen significant growth in the 1990s and 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fedpol.admin.ch/etc/medialib/data/sicherheit/bericht_innere_sicherheit.Par.0042.File.tmp/d_s01_s92.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030110036/http://www.fedpol.admin.ch/etc/medialib/data/sicherheit/bericht_innere_sicherheit.Par.0042.File.tmp/d_s01_s92.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 October 2007|title=Wayback Machine|date=30 October 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is reflected in the foundation of the [[Partei National Orientierter Schweizer]] in 2000, which resulted in an improved organizational structure of the neo-Nazi and white supremacist scene.

Though [[Hindu nationalists]] distanced themselves from the [[totalitarian]] regimes with whom they had previously enjoyed close ties, Nazism and [[Nazi occultism]], in particular, have remained a subject of interest in India throughout the post-War era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Hindu Nationalist's Historical Links to Nazism and Fascism| work = International Business Times| accessdate = 2018-11-11| date = 2012-03-06| url = https://www.ibtimes.com/hindu-nationalists-historical-links-nazism-fascism-214222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pakistan====
Pro-Nazi sentiment is widespread in Pakistan, according to the German magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', compounded by the anti-Semitism engendered by the opposition to Israel and support for Palestine general throughout the region.  Such attitudes, exemplified by a belief that Hitler was a military genius, are shared by both Muslims and Hindus, and are related to the belief that Pakistanis are Aryans, and therefore would be accepted in Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name="spi"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/the-fuehrer-cult-germans-cringe-at-hitler-s-popularity-in-pakistan-a-683966.html|title=The Führer Cult; Germans Cringe at Hitler's Popularity in Pakistan|first=Hasnain|last=Kazim|date=2010-03-17|newspaper=Speigel Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-Nazi activity is not common or widespread in [[Israel]], and the few reported activities have all been the work of extremists, who were punished severely. One notable case is that of [[Patrol 36]], a cell in [[Petah Tikva]] made up of eight teenage immigrants from the former Soviet Union who had been attacking foreign workers and gay people, and vandalizing [[synagogue]]s with Nazi images.&lt;ref name="BBC Israeli"&gt;{{cite news|title=Israeli 'neo-Nazi gang' arrested|date=9 September 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6985808.stm|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Asser"&gt;{{cite news|title=Israeli anger over 'Nazi' group|author=Martin Asser|publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6987848.stm|date=10 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; These neo-Nazis were reported to have operated in cities across Israel, and have been described as being influenced by the rise of neo-Nazism in Europe;&lt;ref name="BBC Israeli"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Asser"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6989776.stm |title=Middle East &amp;#124; Israeli neo-Nazi suspects charged |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-09-11 |accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly influenced by similar movements in Russia and Ukraine, as the rise of the phenomenon is widely credited to immigrants from those two states, the largest sources of emigration to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel's Unbelievable Neo-Nazis|date=8 December 2008|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezXm9jkukBo|publisher=Journeyman Pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widely publicized arrests have led to a call to reform the [[Law of Return]] to permit the revocation of Israeli citizenship for – and the subsequent deportation of – neo-Nazis.&lt;ref name="Asser"/&gt;

====Mongolia====

From 2008, Mongolian neo-Nazi groups have defaced buildings in [[Ulaanbaatar]], smashed [[Chinese people|Chinese]] shopkeepers' windows, and killed Chinese immigrants.

Though Tsagaan Khass leaders say they do not support violence, they are self-proclaimed Nazis. "Adolf Hitler was someone we respect. He taught us how to preserve national identity," said the 41-year-old co-founder, who calls himself Big Brother. "We don't agree with his extremism and starting the Second World War. We are against all those killings, but we support his ideology. We support nationalism rather than fascism."

====Taiwan====
{{main article|National Socialism Association}}

The [[National Socialism Association]] (NSA) is a neo-Nazi political organisation founded in [[Taiwan]] in September 2006 by Hsu Na-chi ({{zh|t=許娜琦}}), at that time a 22-year-old female [[political science]] graduate of [[Soochow University (Taiwan)|Soochow University]]. The NSA has an explicit stated goal of obtaining the power to govern the state. The [[Simon Wiesenthal Centre]] condemned the National Socialism Association on 13 March 2007 for championing the former [[Nazi]] dictator and blaming democracy for [[social unrest]] in Taiwan.&lt;ref name=Haaretz837967&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/837697.html "Taiwan political activists admiring Hitler draw Jewish protests"] ''[[Haaretz]]'' ([[Reuters]], the [[Associated Press]]). 14 March 2007.

====Canada====
[[Neo-Nazism in Canada]] began with the formation of the [[Canadian Nazi Party]] in 1965. In the 1970s and 1980s, neo-Nazism continued to spread in the country as organizations including the [[Western Guard Party]] and [[Creativity (religion)|Church of the Creator]] (later renamed ''Creativity'') promoted white supremacist ideals.&lt;ref name= source2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/|title=Holocaust Educational Resource|publisher=nizkor.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in the United States in 1973, Creativity calls for [[white people]] to wage [[Ben Klassen#Racial holy war|racial holy war]] (Rahowa) against Jews and other perceived enemies.&lt;ref name= source14&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berlet | first1 = Chip | last2 = Vysotsky | first2 = Stanislav | year = 2006 | title = Overview of U.S. White Supremacist Groups | url = | journal = Journal of Political and Military Sociology | volume = 34 | issue = 1| pages = 11–48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Don Andrews]] founded the [[Nationalist Party of Canada]] in 1977. The purported goals of the unregistered party are "the promotion and maintenance of European Heritage and Culture in Canada," but the party is known for anti-Semitism and racism. Many influential neo-Nazi Leaders, such as [[Wolfgang Droege]], were affiliated with the party, but many of its members left to join the Heritage Front, which was founded in 1989.&lt;ref name= source3/&gt;

Droege founded the [[Heritage Front]] in [[Toronto]] at a time when leaders of the white supremacist movement were "disgruntled about the state of the radical right" and wanted to unite unorganized groups of white supremacists into an influential and efficient group with common objectives.&lt;ref name= source3/&gt;  Plans for the organization began in September 1989, and the formation of the Heritage Front was formally announced a couple of months later in November. In the 1990s, [[George Burdi]] of [[Resistance Records]] and the band [[Rahowa (band)|Rahowa]] popularized the Creativity movement and the [[white power music]] scene.&lt;ref name=source1&gt;Hamm, Mark S. ''American Skinheads: The Criminology and Control of Hate Crime''. Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2016}}

Controversy and dissention has left many Canadian neo-Nazi organizations dissolved or weakened.&lt;ref name= source3&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burstow | first1 = Bonnie | year = 2003 | title = Surviving and thriving by becoming more 'groupuscular': the case of the Heritage Front | url = | journal = Patterns of Prejudice | volume = 37 | issue = 4| pages = 415–428 | doi=10.1080/0031322032000144492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chile====
{{main article|Nazism in Chile}}
[[File:Flag_of_National_Socialist_Movement_of_Chile.svg|thumb|upright|Flag of the [[National Socialist Movement of Chile]]]]
After the dissolution of the [[National Socialist Movement of Chile]] (MNSCH) in 1938, notable former members of MNSCH migrated into [[Partido Agrario Laborista]] (PAL), obtaining high positions.&lt;ref name=etche&gt;Etchepare, Jaime Antonio; Stewart; Hamish I., ''Nazism in Chile: A Particular Type of Fascism in South America. ''[[Journal of Contemporary History]]'' (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Not all former MNSCH members joined the PAL; some continued to form parties that followed the MNSCH model until 1952.&lt;ref name=etche/&gt; A new old-school Nazi party was formed in 1964 by school teacher [[Franz Pfeiffer]].&lt;ref name=etche/&gt; Among the activities of this group were the organization of a ''Miss Nazi'' beauty contest and the formation of a Chilean branch of the [[Ku Klux Klan]].&lt;ref name=etche/&gt; The party disbanded in 1970. Pfeiffer attempted to restart it in 1983 in the wake of a wave of protests against the [[Chile under Pinochet|Augusto Pinochet regime]].&lt;ref name=etche/&gt;

[[Nicolás Palacios]] considered the "Chilean race" to be a mix of two bellicose master races: the [[Visigoth]]s of Spain and the [[Mapuche]] (Araucanians) of Chile.&lt;ref name=palaciosmestizo&gt;[[Nicolás Palacios|Palacios, Nicolás]], ''Raza Chilena'' (Editorial Chilena, 1918), pp. 35—36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Palacios traces the origins of the Spanish component of the "Chilean race" to the coast of the [[Baltic Sea]], specifically to [[Götaland]] in [[Sweden]],&lt;ref name=palaciosmestizo/&gt; one of the supposed [[homeland]]s of the [[Goths]]. Palacios claimed that both the blonde-haired and the bronze-coloured Chilean [[Mestizo]] share a "moral physonomy" and a masculine psychology.&lt;ref name=palaciospsico&gt;[[Nicolás Palacios|Palacios, Nicolás]], ''Raza Chilena'' (Editorial Chilena, 1918), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; He opposed immigration from [[Southern Europe]], and argued that Mestizos who are derived from south Europeans lack "cerebral control" and are a social burden.&lt;ref name=palacioslatino&gt;[[Nicolás Palacios|Palacios, Nicolás]], ''Raza Chilena'' (Editorial Chilena, 1918), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Costa Rica ====
Several neo-Nazi groups exist in [[Costa Rica]]. The first to receive attention was the [[Costa Rican National Socialist Party]], which is now disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wvw.nacion.com/ln_ee/2003/noviembre/09/pais3.html |title=nacion.com / Nacionales |publisher=Wvw.nacion.com |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others include Costa Rican National Socialist Youth, Costa Rican National Socialist Alliance, New Social Order, Costa Rican National Socialist Resistance (which is Costa Rica's member of the [[World Union of National Socialists]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalsocialist.net/members.htm |title=World Union of National Socialists Membership Directory : W.U.N.S. |publisher=Nationalsocialist.net |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Hiperborean Spear Society. The groups normally target [[Jewish]]-[[Costa Ricans]], [[Afro-Costa Rican]]s, [[communism|Communists]], gay people and especially [[Nicaragua]]n and [[Colombian people|Colombian]] immigrants. The media has discovered the existence of an underground neo-Nazi group inside the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nacion.com/2012-04-16/Sucesos/null.aspx |title=Fuerza Pública investiga fotos de policía en Facebook - SUCESOS - |newspaper=La Nación |date=2012-04-16 |accessdate=2012-11-07 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120702214252/http://www.nacion.com/2012-04-16/Sucesos/null.aspx |archivedate=2 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
[[File:National Socialist Movement Rally US Capitol.jpg|thumb|250px|The NSM rally on the West lawn of the [[United States Capitol|US Capitol]], Washington DC, 2008]]

There are several neo-Nazi groups in the United States. The [[National Socialist Movement (United States)|National Socialist Movement]] (NSM), with about 400 members in 32 states,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/us/11nazi.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all "Neo-Nazi Father Is Killed; Son, 10, Steeped in Beliefs, Is Accused"]. ''The New York Times''. 10 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; is currently the largest neo-Nazi organization in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/Learn/Ext_US/nsm/default.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=3&amp;item=nsm "The National Socialist Movement"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104004433/http://www.adl.org/Learn/Ext_US/nsm/default.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=3&amp;item=nsm |date=4 January 2013 }}. [[The Anti-Defamation League]].&lt;/ref&gt;  After World War II, new organizations formed with varying degrees of support for Nazi principles. The [[National States' Rights Party]], founded in 1958 by Edward Reed Fields and [[J. B. Stoner]] countered [[racial integration]] in the [[Southern United States]] with Nazi-inspired publications and iconography. The [[American Nazi Party]], founded by [[George Lincoln Rockwell]] in 1959, achieved high-profile coverage in the press through its public demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Jeffrey, ''[[Encyclopedia of White Power]]: A Sourcebook on the Radical Racist Right'' (Rowman Altamira, 2000), pp. 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideology of [[James H. Madole]], leader of the [[National Renaissance Party (United States)|National Renaissance Party]], was influenced by [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Blavatskian Theosophy]]. [[Helena Blavatsky]] developed a racial theory of [[evolution]], holding that the [[white race]] was the "fifth rootrace" called the [[Aryan Race]]. According to Blavatsky, Aryans had been preceded by Atlanteans who had perished in the flood that sunk the continent [[Atlantis]]. The three races that preceded the Atlanteans, in Blavatsky's view, were proto-humans; these were the [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemurians]], [[Hyperborea|Hyperboreans]] and the first Astral rootrace. It was on upon this foundation that Madole based his claims the Aryan Race has been worshiped as "White Gods" since time immemorial and proposed a governance structure based on the Hindu [[Laws of Manu]] and its hierarchical [[Caste system in India|caste system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=NYU Press |isbn=978-0-8147-3155-0 |last=Goodrick-Clarke |first=Nicholas |title=Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity |date=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Black_Sun.html?id=xaiaM77s6N4C |pages=79–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] guarantees [[freedom of speech]], which allows political organizations great latitude in expressing Nazi, racist, and anti-Semitic views. A First Amendment landmark case was ''[[National Socialist Party of America v. Village of Skokie]]'', in which neo-Nazis threatened to march in a predominantly Jewish suburb of Chicago. The march never took place in Skokie, but the court ruling allowed the neo-Nazis to stage a series of demonstrations in Chicago.

In May 2018, graduating students at [[Baraboo High School]], in [[Barabooo, Wisconsin]], appeared to perform a Nazi salute in a [[Baraboo Nazi salute photo|photograph]] taken before their junior prom.  The image went viral on social media six months later, in November 2018.  The school decided not to punish the students due to their First Amendment rights.

The [[Institute for Historical Review]], formed in 1978, is a [[Holocaust denial]] body associated with neo-Nazism.&lt;ref name=ADL&gt;[http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/historical_review.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=3&amp;item=ihr "Extremism in America: Institute for Historical Review"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115233810/http://www.adl.org/Learn/ext_us/historical_review.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=3&amp;item=ihr |date=15 January 2013 }}, [[Anti-Defamation League]].

Organizations which report upon American neo-Nazi activities include the [[Anti-Defamation League]] and the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]].

There were a number of now-defunct Australian neo-Nazi groups, such as the [[Australian National Socialist Party]] (ANSP), which was formed in 1962 and merged into the [[National Socialist Party of Australia]] (1968-1970s), originally a splinter group, in 1968,&lt;ref name="Henderson 76"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=27516076|title=Frank Browne and the Neo-Nazis|last=Henderson|first=Peter|journal=Labour History|date=November 2005|number=89|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jack van Tongeren]]'s Australian Nationalist Movement.&lt;ref name="Henderson 76"/&gt;

{{Objectivist movement}}
The '''Objectivist movement''' is a [[Social movement|movement]] of individuals who seek to study and advance [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], the philosophy expounded by novelist-philosopher [[Ayn Rand]]. The movement began informally in the 1950s and consisted of students who were brought together by their mutual interest in Rand's novel, ''[[The Fountainhead]]''. The group, ironically named "the Collective" due to their actual advocacy of [[individualism]], in part consisted of [[Leonard Peikoff]], [[Nathaniel Branden]], [[Barbara Branden]], [[Alan Greenspan]], and [[Murray Rothbard]]. Nathaniel Branden, a young Canadian student who had been greatly inspired by Rand's work, became a close confidant and encouraged Rand to expand her philosophy into a formal movement. From this informal beginning in Rand's living room, the movement expanded into a collection of [[think tank]]s, academic organizations, and [[Objectivist periodicals|periodicals]].

==History==
===The Collective===
"The Collective" was Rand's private name&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|p=254}}. In public she referred to them as "the class of '43", after the year ''The Fountainhead'' was published. ''cf''. {{harvnb|Baker|1987|p=18}} and {{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; for a group of close confidants, students, and proponents of Rand and Objectivism during the 1950s and 1960s. The founding members of the group were [[Nathaniel Branden]], [[Barbara Branden]], [[Leonard Peikoff]], [[Alan Greenspan]], [[Joan Kennedy Taylor]], Allan Blumenthal, Harry Kalberman, Elayne Kalberman, Joan Mitchell, and Mary Ann Sures (formerly Rukavina).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=88}}; {{harvnb|Branden|1986|p=254}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This group became the nucleus of a growing movement of Rand admirers whose name was chosen by Rand as a joke based on Objectivism's staunch commitment to [[individualism]].

The Collective originally started out as an informal gathering of friends (many of them related to one another) who met with Rand on weekends at her apartment on East 36th Street in [[New York City]] to discuss philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Paxton|1998|p=156}}; {{harvnb|Greenspan|2007|p= 40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Branden said the group met "because of a common interest in ideas".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|p= 254}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Greenspan recalled being drawn to Rand because of a shared belief in "the importance of mathematics and intellectual rigor".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenspan|2007|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group met at Rand's apartment at least once a week, and would often discuss and debate into the early morning hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenspan|2007|p= 40}}; {{harvnb|Paxton|1998|p= 156}}.&lt;/ref&gt; About these discussions, Greenspan said, "Talking to Ayn Rand was like starting a game of chess thinking I was good, and suddenly finding myself in checkmate."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenspan|2007|pp=40–41}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Rand also allowed them to begin reading the manuscript of ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'' (1957) as she completed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp= 254–255}}; {{harvnb|Paxton|1998|p= 156}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As the years went on, the Collective would proceed to play a larger, more formal role, promoting Rand's philosophy through the [[Nathaniel Branden Institute]] (NBI). Some Collective members gave lectures at the NBI in cities across the United States and wrote articles for its newsletters, ''[[Objectivist periodicals#The Objectivist Newsletter|The Objectivist Newsletter]]'' (1962–1965) and ''[[Objectivist periodicals#The Objectivist|The Objectivist]]'' (1966–1971).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=95}}; {{harvnb|Baker|1987|p= 18}}; {{harvnb|Branden|1999|p= 255}}; {{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp= 307, 312–313}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, after a complex series of events, Rand expelled Nathaniel and Barbara Branden from the Collective.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Paxton|1998|p=142}}; {{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=101}}; {{harvnb|Rand|1968}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the subsequent years, the Collective slowly broke apart for numerous reasons. (Peikoff, Greenspan and Sures remained associated with Rand until her death. Rand expelled [[Kay Nolte Smith]], while Allan and Joan Mitchell Blumenthal and [[Robert Hessen]] left on their own.)&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp= 363–422}}, esp. "Denouement" and "Epilogue," and {{harvnb|Doherty|2007|pp= 537–538}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Peikoff eventually became Rand's legal heir and the person she described as the best teacher of her ideas, and has been called{{by whom?|date=October 2017}} Rand's "intellectual heir".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=387}}; {{harvnb|Doherty|2007|p=661n16}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Rand's death in 1982, Peikoff founded (1985) the [[Ayn Rand Institute]] to promote Objectivist philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p= 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nathaniel Branden Institute===
{{Main article|Nathaniel Branden Institute}}
The first formal presentation of Objectivism began with the Nathaniel Branden Lectures (NBL), shortly after the publication of Rand's final novel, ''Atlas Shrugged''. Nathaniel Branden was the first member of The Collective, and later, Rand's "intellectual heir."&lt;ref name="passion"&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; In time, Branden and Rand became romantically involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the publication of ''Atlas Shrugged'', Rand was inundated with requests for more information about her philosophy. Not wanting to be a teacher or leader of an organized movement, she allowed Branden to lecture on her behalf.&lt;ref name="passion"/&gt;

The success of NBL prompted Branden to expand his lecture organization into the [[Nathaniel Branden Institute]] (NBI). Rand and Branden also co-founded the first publication devoted to the study and application of Objectivism. ''The Objectivist Newsletter'' began publication in 1962 and was later expanded into ''The Objectivist''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hessen|1999|pp=351–352}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960s saw a rapid expansion of the Objectivist movement. Rand was a frequent lecturer at universities across the country. Rand hosted a radio program on Objectivism on the Columbia University station, [[WKCR-FM]]. The [[Nathaniel Branden Institute]] (NBI) hosted lectures on Objectivism, the history of philosophy, art, and psychology in cities across the country. Campus clubs devoted to studying Rand's philosophy formed throughout the country, though operated independently of NBI. Rand was a frequent guest on radio and television, as well as an annual lecturer at the Ford Hall Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the peak of its popularity, NBI was delivering taped lectures in over 80 cities.&lt;ref&gt;''The Objectivist Newsletter'' vol. 4 no. 12&lt;/ref&gt; By 1967 NBI had leased an entire floor in the [[Empire State Building]] (with ''The Objectivist'' as a sub-tenant).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=350, 373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Rand publicly broke with Nathaniel and Barbara Branden.&lt;ref name="Rand1968a"&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1968|p=449}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She accused Nathaniel Branden of a "gradual departure from the principles of Objectivism,"&lt;ref name="Rand1968a"/&gt; financial exploitation of her related to business loans, and "deliberate deception of several persons."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1968|pp=452–453}}; ''cf''. {{harvnb|Doherty|2007|p=334}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a response sent to the mailing list of ''The Objectivist'' in 1968, the Brandens denied many of Rand's charges against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=354–355}}; {{harvnb|Doherty|2007|pp=334–335}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The result of their conflicting claims was a "schism", as some participants in the Objectivist movement supported the Brandens, while others supported Rand's repudiation of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doherty|2007|pp=334–336}}; {{harvnb|Baker|1987|pp=24–25}}; {{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=355–356}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=18}}; {{harvnb|Walker|1999|pp=43–46}}. Baker and Walker both use the term "schism," as does {{harvnb|Peikoff|1989|pp=1, 5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert L. Bradley, Jr.]] has called the dissolution of NBI an "organizational failure" in the Objectivist movement "as stunning as the collapse of Enron in a different context"; he charges Rand with "resorting to half-truths" and concludes that she "would never own up to the circumstances leading to the split, personally or publicly."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bradley Jr.|2009|pp=320, 327}} Bradley devotes Appendix A in his book (pp. 320–331) to "The Ayn Rand Problem."&lt;/ref&gt;

NBI was closed and its offices vacated, in an environment that Barbara Branden described as "total hysteria" as its former students learned about the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=351–352}}; ''cf''. {{harvnb|Rand|1968|p=455}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Brandens continued for a time to sell some of NBI's recorded lectures through a new company,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Legal Notice |last=Holzer |first=Henry Mark |journal=The Objectivist |date=May 1969 |volume=8 |issue=5 |page=656 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; but otherwise had little involvement with the Objectivist movement until their biographical books about Rand were released.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986}} and {{harvnb|Branden|1999}}, which was originally released in 1989 under the title ''Judgment Day: My Years with Ayn Rand''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Objectivist'' continued publishing with Rand as editor and Leonard Peikoff as associate editor. Peikoff also took over Nathaniel Branden's role as the primary lecturer on Objectivism.&lt;ref name="Hessen 1999 p=353"&gt;{{harvnb|Hessen|1999|p=353}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Peikoff later described the Brandens' expulsion as the first "of the many schisms that have plagued the Objectivist movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1989|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
[[File:Leonard Peikoff.tiff|thumb|upright|alt=|Leonard Peikoff delivered lectures on Objectivism throughout the 1970s.]]
In the 1970s, Rand gave fewer public speeches. She concentrated instead on nonfiction writing and on helping the work of her students and associates, through efforts such as a series of private workshops on [[epistemology]] that she conducted from 1969 through 1971 for about a dozen students and professionals in philosophy, math and physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Objectivist'' was replaced by ''[[Objectivist periodicals#The Ayn Rand Letter|The Ayn Rand Letter]]'' in 1971. While ''The Objectivist'' had published articles by many authors, ''The Ayn Rand Letter,'' marketed as a personal newsletter from Rand, published only her work (plus occasionally Leonard Peikoff's).&lt;ref name="Hessen 1999 p=353"/&gt;

Throughout the decade, Peikoff continued to offer a number of lecture series on various topics related to Objectivism to large audiences, often incorporating new philosophic material.&lt;ref&gt;"Founders of Western Philosophy" (1972) and "The Philosophy of Objectivism" (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; Rand worked closely with Peikoff,&lt;ref name="own words"&gt;{{Cite AV media |people=Peikoff, Leonard |title=Leonard Peikoff in His Own Words |medium=DVD |publisher=Northern River Productions}}&lt;/ref&gt; helping edit his book, ''[[The Ominous Parallels]]'', for which she wrote the introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Peikoff |first=Leonard |year=1982 |title=The Ominous Parallels |publisher=Plume |isbn=0-452-01117-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-1979, Rand's associate [[Peter Schwartz (writer)|Peter Schwartz]] began editing and publishing ''[[Objectivist periodicals#The Intellectual Activist|The Intellectual Activist]]'', a publication which Rand recommended to her audience. Another associate of hers during this period was [[Harry Binswanger]], whom she advised on his mini-encyclopedia of Objectivism, ''The Ayn Rand Lexicon: Objectivism from A to Z'' (1986).&lt;ref&gt;New American Library, 1986; online at www.aynrandlexicon.com&lt;/ref&gt; After the close of ''The Objectivist Calendar,'' a short publication listing upcoming events within the Objectivist movement, Binswanger began editing and publishing ''The Objectivist Forum'', a bimonthly journal on Objectivism which had Rand's support and for which she served as "philosophic consultant."&lt;ref&gt;"To the Readers of the Objectivist Forum," ''The Objectivist Forum,'' vol. 1, no. 1 (Feb. 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
Upon Rand's death on March 6, 1982, Peikoff inherited her estate, including the control of the copyrights to her books and writing (barring ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]'', in the public domain). Shortly after Rand's death, Peikoff's first book, ''The Ominous Parallels'', was published. In 1983, Peikoff gave a series of lectures titled ''Understanding Objectivism'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Announcements |journal=The Objectivist Forum |date=June 1983 |volume=3 |issue=3 |page=16 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the purpose of improving the ''methodology'' used in studying Objectivism, as a corrective to what he describes as the "Rationalist" and the "Empiricist" methods of thought.

A high-quality bimonthly philosophical journal, [[The Objectivist Forum]], was published from 1980 to 1987. 

In 1985, Leonard Peikoff and [[Ed Snider]] founded the [[Ayn Rand Institute]] (ARI), the first organization devoted to the study and advocacy of Objectivism since the closure of NBI in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Announcements |journal=[[Objectivist periodicals#The Objectivist Forum|The Objectivist Forum]] |date= December 1984 |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute began by sponsoring essay contests on Rand's novels and distributing op-eds analyzing world events from an Objectivist perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Report from the Ayn Rand Institute |journal=[[Objectivist periodicals#The Objectivist Forum|The Objectivist Forum]] |last=Berliner |first=Michael S. |date=October 1985 |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, the institute began teaching aspiring Objectivist academics.&lt;ref&gt;''Impact'' (newsletter of the Ayn Rand Institute), June 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peikoff–Kelley split===
In 1989, another major split occurred within the Objectivist movement. As [[Brian Doherty (journalist)|Brian Doherty]] describes it, [[David Kelley]], a philosopher and lecturer then affiliated with ARI, was "booted from the official Objectivist world" for disagreeing "about the inherent evils of Barbara Branden's Rand biography [''[[The Passion of Ayn Rand]]'']" and "''publicly defend[ing] on principle'' the notion of Objectivists talking to libertarians."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doherty|2007|pp=538–539}}; the italics are Doherty's.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kelley was criticized by [[Peter Schwartz (writer)|Peter Schwartz]] for giving a speech under the auspices of [[Laissez Faire Books]] (LFB), a libertarian [[bookseller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelley|2000|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Schwartz argued that this activity violated the Objectivist moral principle of sanction. In other words, Kelley was implicitly conferring moral approval on the organization by appearing at an event that it sponsored. LFB, in turn, was morally objectionable because it promoted books, such as ''The Passion of Ayn Rand'' (1986), that Schwartz maintained were hostile and defamatory towards Rand and Objectivism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=On Sanctioning the Sanctioners |journal=The Intellectual Activist |date=February 27, 1989 |volume=4 |issue=20 |first=Peter |last=Schwartz |page=1 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Although Schwartz made no mention of it, Leonard Peikoff had signed copies of his book ''The Ominous Parallels'' at three LFB events in 1982. According to Peikoff, he later broke off relations with LFB after being told that LFB offered [[Anarchism|anarchist]] literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ramsey |first=Bruce |date=January–February 2008 |title=''Laissez-Faire'': R.I.P.? |journal=Liberty |volume=22 |issue=1 |url=http://www.libertyunbound.com/archive/2008_01/ramsey-lf.html |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Kelley responded, in a paper titled "A Question of Sanction", by disputing Schwartz's interpretation of the sanction principle in particular and his interpretation of moral principles in general.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley's paper was at first circulated privately, but is reproduced as an appendix in {{harvnb|Kelley|2000|pp=113–117}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, in an essay appearing in ''The Intellectual Activist'', Peikoff endorsed Schwartz's view and claimed that Kelley's arguments contradicted the fundamental principles of Objectivism. Peikoff maintained that many non-Objectivist systems of thought, such as Marxism, are based on "inherently dishonest ideas" whose advocacy must never be sanctioned.&lt;ref name="Peikoff"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Fact and Value |journal=The Intellectual Activist |date=May 18, 1989 |volume=5 |issue=1 |first=Leonard |last=Peikoff |url=http://ari.aynrand.org/issues/culture-and-society/religion-and-morality/Fact-and-Value}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attributed the fall of NBI and subsequent schisms not to "differences in regard to love affairs or political strategy or proselytizing techniques or anybody's personality," but to a "fundamental and philosophical" cause: "if you grasp and accept the concept of 'objectivity,' in all its implications, then you accept Objectivism, you live by it and you revere Ayn Rand for defining it. If you fail fully to grasp and accept the concept, whether your failure is deliberate or otherwise, you eventually drift away from Ayn Rand's orbit, or rewrite her viewpoint or turn openly into her enemy." Those who criticized his position were to make their exit: "if you agree with the Branden or Kelley viewpoint or anything resembling it—please drop out of our movement: drop Ayn Rand, leave Objectivism alone. We do not want you and Ayn Rand would not have wanted you [...]"&lt;ref name="Peikoff"/&gt;

Kelley responded to the Peikoff–Schwartz critique in his monograph, "Truth and Toleration", later updated as ''The Contested Legacy of Ayn Rand''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Truth and Toleration |last=Kelley |first=David |location=Verbank, New York |publisher=Institute for Objectivist Studies |year=1990}} Revised as {{harvnb|Kelley|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He responded to his ostracism by founding the Institute for Objectivist Studies (IOS), later renamed The Objectivist Center (TOC) and then [[The Atlas Society]] (TAS), with the help of Ed Snider, one of the founders of the Ayn Rand Institute. Kelley was joined by Objectivist scholars George Walsh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Statement |journal=The Intellectual Activist |date=November 17, 1989 |volume=5 |issue=3 |first=George |last=Walsh |page=5 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jim Lennox, as well as former Collective members Joan and Allan Blumenthal.&lt;ref name="iossem95"&gt;IOS Summer Seminar (1995).

===1990s===
Kelley's Institute for Objectivist Studies began to publish material on Objectivism and host conferences for Rand scholars in 1990. IOS held a symposium on [[Chris Matthew Sciabarra]]'s book, ''[[Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical]]'' (1995).&lt;ref name="harvnb|Sciabarra|1995"&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; IOS invited Nathaniel&lt;ref name="iossem96"&gt;IOS Summer Seminar (1996). http://www.objectivistcenter.org/events/oldsems/seminars-sem96.asp#pers Accessed July 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and Barbara Branden&lt;ref name="iossem99"&gt;IOS Summer Seminar (1999). http://www.objectivistcenter.org/events/sem99/seminars-sem99.asp Accessed July 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; to participate in the institute's activities, effectively bringing them back into the Objectivist movement, and they continued to appear at events for the organization until their deaths in 2014 and 2013, respectively. In 1999, IOS renamed itself to The Objectivist Center.

In 1991, Peikoff's book ''[[Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand]]'' was published. It was the first comprehensive presentation of Rand's philosophy to appear in print. In 1994, the Ayn Rand Institute expanded its educational programs into the Objectivist Graduate Center (OGC), which held classes led by Leonard Peikoff and Harry Binswanger. 1996 saw a series of lectures on Objectivism by ARI intellectuals at [[Harvard University|Harvard]].&lt;ref name="Impact December 2006"&gt;''Impact'' December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; ARI increased its notoriety by staging a protest against President Clinton's volunteerism initiative in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aynrand2.org/no_servitude/update.html ARI website]&lt;/ref&gt; ARI gathered more attention for its activism on behalf of the family of Elian Gonzalez. 1996 saw the release of the Academy Award-nominated documentary ''[[Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life]]'', directed by [[Michael Paxton]]. In 1999, the United States Postal Service released an Ayn Rand stamp.&lt;ref&gt;''Impact'' April 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
[[File:Yaron Brook at Tea Party Patriots.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=|Yaron Brook was executive director of ARI from 2000 to 2017.]]
In 2000, [[Yaron Brook]] succeeded Michael Berliner as head of ARI,&lt;ref&gt;''Impact'' March 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and ARI expanded its OGC into the Objectivist Academic Center (OAC), offering undergraduate and graduate courses on Objectivism, writing, history, the history of philosophy, and the history of science.&lt;ref&gt;''Impact'' September 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Several OAC classes are now accredited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=education_academic_index OAC website]&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 2000s, ARI increased its media presence, publishing op-eds and providing intellectuals for live interviews. In 2005, ARI helped establish the Ayn Rand Institute Canada, which distributes free books to Canadian schools. In 2006, ARI sponsored a conference on the [[War on Terror]]. In addition to Objectivist speakers, mid-east scholars [[Daniel Pipes]], [[Robert Spencer (author)|Robert Spencer]], and Danish newspaper editor [[Flemming Rose]] gave lectures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.objectivistconferences.com/fordhall06/ The Jihad Against the West]&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007, ARI had donated 700,000 copies of Rand's novels to high schools around the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''Impact'' February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Objectivist Center also went through a number of changes in the 2000s. In 2005, founder David Kelley stepped aside as executive director in favor of former [[Cato Institute]] scholar Ed Hudgins, while Kelley stayed on as Chief Intellectual Officer, and the institute relocated to Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.objectivistcenter.org/center/news/news_dc-announcement.asp |title=The Objectivist Center to Move to DC |date=December 15, 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051119034917/http://www.objectivistcenter.org/center/news/news_dc-announcement.asp |archivedate=November 19, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the organization rebranded itself again, changing its name to The Atlas Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.objectivistcenter.org/cth-13-1712-The_Atlas_Society_and_TheObjectivist_Center_names.aspx |title=The Atlas Society and The Objectivist Center Names |publisher=The Atlas Society |date=June 5, 2006 |accessdate=June 16, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312070701/http://www.objectivistcenter.org/cth-13-1712-The_Atlas_Society_and_TheObjectivist_Center_names.aspx |archivedate=March 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Domingo García founded Objetivismo Internacional (OI) in [[Spain]] to help spread Objectivism in the [[Hispanophone|Spanish-speaking world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlasnetwork.org/partners/global-directory/objetivismo-internacional |title=Objetivismo Internacional |website=AtlasNetwork.com |accessdate=October 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; OI is not officially affiliated with any other Objectivist organization; however, they closely collaborate with the Ayn Rand Institute. OI is based in [[Murcia|Murcia, Spain]], and García is its [[Chief executive officer|CEO]].&lt;ref name="objetivismo"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://objetivismo.org/about-us/ |title=About Us |website=Objetivismo.org |accessdate=October 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s===
A central goal for ARI throughout the 2010s has been to spread Objectivism internationally. ARI helped establish the Ayn Rand Center Israel in October 2012, the Ayn Rand Institute Europe in April 2015, and the Ayn Rand Center Japan in February 2017. Each of these institutions are affiliated with ARI but are separate legal entities. In 2017, Jim Brown replaced Yaron Brook as the operational executive of ARI, while Brook continues as its chairman of the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/socal/daily-pilot/entertainment/tn-wknd-et-0219-ayn-rand-institute-20170218-story.html |title=Jim Brown, new Ayn Rand Institute CEO: 'Culture and society out there can look pretty irrational.

In 2014, Carl Barney launched the Objectivist Venture Fund, originally the Anthem Venture Fund, which has helped fund a number of Objectivist initiatives, including ''[[Objectivist periodicals#The Undercurrent|The Undercurrent]]'' and the Ayn Rand Center Israel.&lt;ref name="OCON 2015"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbWgESQV9Eo&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Ayn Rand Center Israel launched the Atlas Award for the Best Israeli Start-up, presented annually at the [[Tel Aviv Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref name="JPost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Business-and-Innovation/Tech-Talk-Israels-Fortune-500-companies-496935 |title=Tech Talk: Israel's Fortune 500 companies |author=Shapira, Ariel |website=JPost.com |access-date=November 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judges for the award include Yaron Brook and [[Shlomo Kalish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-spirit-of-ayn-rand-israeli-entrepreneurship-to-get-a-boost/ |title=In spirit of Ayn Rand, Israeli entrepreneurship to get a boost |website=TimesofIsrael.com |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moovit]] was the first recipient of the award in 2016.

In 2016, Objetivismo USA was established as a [[501(c)3]] [[nonprofit organization]] in [[New York City|New York]], [[New York (state)|New York]] as a sister organization of Objetivismo Internacional.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nycompanygo.com/Objetivismo-Usa-Inc-4904832/&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] is Edwin Thompson.&lt;ref name="objetivismo"/&gt;

The Atlas Society has also undergone a change in leadership in the 2010s. In 2011, Aaron Day replaced Ed Hudgins as the operational executive of The Atlas Society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/10/prweb9884847.htm |title=The Atlas Society Announces Aaron Day as New CEO and Appoints New Board of Advisors |publisher=PRWeb |date=October 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on March 1, 2016, The Atlas Society announced Jennifer Grossman as its new CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://atlassociety.org/about-us/about-us-archive/5947-jennifer-anju-grossman-ceo|title=The Atlas Society welcomes Jennifer Anju Grossman as its new CEO|work=The Atlas Society|access-date=August 10, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectivism in academia==
Despite the fact that several members of the Collective were philosophy graduate students at [[New York University|NYU]],&lt;ref name="own words"/&gt; Objectivism did not begin to make serious inroads into academic philosophy until the 1980s. Rand herself had much disdain for modern academia, citing the poor state of American universities, particularly the [[humanities]], as the source of much of the country's problems,&lt;ref name="new intellectual"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rand |first=Ayn |title=For the New Intellectual |publisher=Signet |isbn=0-451-16308-7 |year=1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Peikoff expressed similar sentiments in the early 1990s, declaring that his book on Objectivism was "written not for academics, but for human beings (including any academics who qualify)."&lt;ref name="opar"&gt;{{cite book |last=Peikoff |first=Leonard |year=1993 |title=[[Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand]] |location=New York |publisher=Meridian |page=xiv |isbn=978-0-452-01101-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ayn Rand Institute initially concentrated on promoting Objectivism independently of academia, supplying free books to high schools and universities, sponsoring essay contests for students and support programs for teachers and professors interested in studying and teaching Rand's ideas.&lt;ref name="About ARI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=about_ari |title=About ARI |accessdate=July 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some limited academic attention was given to Objectivism in the 1970s. In 1971, William F. O'Neill published ''With Charity toward None: An Analysis of Ayn Rand's Philosophy'', in which he provides an academic discussion of Objectivism. Although he alleges flaws in Rand's thinking, he expresses admiration for her efforts, and particularly her ability to motivate readers to think about philosophical issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=With Charity Toward None: An Analysis of Ayn Rand's Philosophy |last=O'Neill |first=William F. |location=New York |publisher=Philosophical Library |year=1971 |isbn=0-8022-2034-7}}; cf. discussion of O'Neill's book in {{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=100}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There was occasional discussion of Rand in scholarly journals throughout the rest of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{cite journal |title=On the Randian Argument |last=Nozick |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Nozick |journal=The Personalist |date=Spring 1971 |volume=52 |pages=282–304}}; {{cite journal |title=The Extroflective Hero: A Look at Ayn Rand |last=Gordon |first=Philip |journal=[[The Journal of Popular Culture]] |date=Autumn 1977 |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=701–710 |doi=10.1111/j.0022-3840.1977.1004_701.x}}; {{cite journal |title=Ayn Rand and Feminism: An Unlikely Alliance |last=Gladstein |first=Mimi R. |journal=[[College English]] |date=February 1978 |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=25–30 |doi=10.2307/375869}}; and {{cite journal |title=Nozick On the Randian Argument |last1=Den Uyl |first1= Douglas |last2=Rasmussen |first2=Douglas |journal=[[Pacific Philosophical Quarterly|The Personalist]] |date=April 1978 |volume=59 |pages=184–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirteen years later, the second book-length academic study of Objectivism appeared. It was a collection of essays called ''[[The Philosophic Thought of Ayn Rand]]'' (1984), edited by Douglas Den Uyl and Douglas Rasmussen. It was also the first book about Rand's thought to be published after her death. Den Uyl and Rasmussen made a specific effort to bring more serious scholarly attention to Objectivism by maintaining high scholarly standards for the essays in their book.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|pp=101–102}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, noted [[Aristotle]] scholar and Rand student [[Allan Gotthelf]] co-founded the Ayn Rand Society with George Walsh and David Kelley,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=William |last=Thomas |title=Ayn Rand Through Two Lenses |journal=Navigator |date=April 2000 |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=15–19 |url=http://www.atlassociety.org/on-ayn-rand-gotthelf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is affiliated with the [[American Philosophical Association]]. Non-Objectivist participants have included [[Jaegwon Kim]] and [[Susan Haack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrandsociety.org |title=Ayn Rand Society |accessdate=May 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Chris Matthew Sciabarra published ''Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical'', an academic study of Rand's ideas and intellectual history.&lt;ref name="harvnb|Sciabarra|1995"/&gt; Rand bibliographer [[Mimi Reisel Gladstein]] called Sciabarra's work "a significant milestone in Rand studies."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=106}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, Sciabarra declared a "renaissance" in the scholarship about Rand, noting that his book was only "one of fifteen book titles dealing with Rand that have been published since 1995, along with countless articles and other references to her work."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1998|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he also noted that not all of the material carried "deep scholarly interest."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1998|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, [[John P. McCaskey]] founded the Anthem Foundation for Objectivist Scholarship, which sponsors the work of professors affiliated with the Ayn Rand Institute.&lt;ref&gt;''Impact'' July 2003&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007 there were 13 such fellowships for the study of Objectivism in universities in the U.S., including at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and the [[University of Texas at Austin]].&lt;ref name="About ARI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Erika |last=Fricke |url=http://www.umc.pitt.edu/pittmag/summer2004/cornerstones.html |title=Follow Reason: An Objectivist Viewpoint |journal=Pitt Magazine |date=Summer 2004 |accessdate=July 25, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611011903/http://www.umc.pitt.edu/pittmag/summer2004/cornerstones.html |archivedate=June 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the Anthem Foundation in conjunction with the [[University of Pittsburgh]] hosted a conference on the philosophy of science called "Concepts and Objectivity: Knowledge, Science, and Values."

Lennox, [[Harry Binswanger]], and [[Tara Smith (philosopher)|Tara Smith]], as well as noted analytic philosophers [[David Sosa]], [[Aloysius Martinich|A. P.

Since 1999, ''[[The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies]]'', edited by [[Stephen D. Cox]], Chris Matthew Sciabarra, and [[R. W. Bradford]] (until his death in 2005), has been published semi-annually as a "nonpartisan," scholarly forum for the discussion of Rand's work and its application to many fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrandstudies.com/jars/index.asp |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020915022014/http://www.aynrandstudies.com/jars/index.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 15, 2002 |title=The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies |accessdate=July 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Journal'' is published by the ''Pennsylvania University Press'' and archived at Stanford University's CLOCKSS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/notablog/archives/001776.html|title=Notablog of Christopher Matthew Sciabarra|last=Sciabarra|first=Christopher Matthew|date=September 10, 2012|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of its editors have been aligned with the Ayn Rand Institute, and no one affiliated with ARI has participated in its exchanges since 2002.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

===Student activism===

Objectivism has remained popular on college campuses, with dozens of student groups dedicated to promoting and studying the philosophy of Objectivism&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; spread across the U.S., Australia, Canada, Guatemala,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Leftist thinking left off the syllabus |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-guatemala6-2008jun06,0,5560223.story |accessdate=May 30, 2009 |first=Marla |last=Dickerson |date=June 6, 2008 |work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A growing concern |first=David |last=Cohen |date=December 7, 2001 |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2001/dec/07/internationaleducationnews.highereducation |accessdate=May 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These clubs often present speakers on controversial topics such as abortion, religion, and foreign policy, often allying with conservative (and sometimes liberal) organizations to organize their events. For example, the [[New York University]] Objectivism Club hosted a joint panel on the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Muhammad cartoons]] that received nationwide coverage for NYU's censorship of the cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=To Show or Not to Show Muhammad Cartoon |date=March 20, 2006 |first=David |last=Epstein |work=Inside Higher Education |url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2006/03/30/cartoon |accessdate=May 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several dozen speakers sponsored by the Ayn Rand Institute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ARC Speakers &amp; Writers|url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=media_speakers_writers |accessdate=May 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other organizations who give nationwide tours each year speaking about Objectivism.

The Ayn Rand Institute has spent $5 million on educational programs advancing Objectivism, including scholarships and clubs. These clubs often obtain educational materials and speakers from ARI. There are also several conferences organized by various organizations, which draw several hundred attendees each summer and feature philosophy courses and presentations of new publications and research. A student-run magazine, ''The Undercurrent'', is published for colleges around the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''The Undercurrent''|url=http://the-undercurrent.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050405214345/http://the-undercurrent.com/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=April 5, 2005|accessdate=May 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
There are a number of writers who cannot be classified as Objectivist but who still exhibit a significant influence of Objectivism in their own work. Prominent among these is [[John Hospers]], Emeritus Professor of Philosophy, [[University of Southern California]], who credited Rand's political ideas as helping to shape his own,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hospers |first=John |year=1971 |title=Libertarianism |location=Los Angeles |publisher=Nash}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in other areas sharp differences remained. Another is [[Murray Rothbard]], who, like Rand, advocated volition, [[Aristotle]] and [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]],&lt;ref&gt;''Individualism and the Methodology of the Social Sciences'', Cato Paper no. 4, [[Cato Institute]], 1979, and ''[[The Ethics of Liberty]]'', Humanities Press, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; but who also advocated [[anarchism]], which was anathema to Rand. Also in this category are journalist [[Edith Efron]], scientist [[Petr Beckmann]], and author [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray]].

==Criticisms and responses==
===Criticisms===
Over the years, some critics have accused the Objectivist movement of being a [[cult]] or cult-like, and Rand of being a cult figure. The term 'Randroid' (a [[portmanteau]] of 'Rand' and '[[Android (robot)|android]]') has been used to evoke the image of "the [[John Galt|Galt]]-imitating robots produced by the cult."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walker|1999|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suggestions of cult-like behavior by Objectivists began during the NBI days. With growing media coverage, articles began appearing that referred to the "Cult of Ayn Rand" and compared her to various religious leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|pp=111–112}}. Gladstein cites articles titled "The Curious Cult of Ayn Rand", "The Cult of Ayn Rand", and "The Cult of Angry Ayn Rand", and comparisons of Rand to [[Joan of Arc]] and [[Aimee Semple McPherson]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terry Teachout]] described NBI as "a quasi-cult which revolved around the adoration of Ayn Rand and her fictional heroes," one that "disintegrated" when Rand split with Nathaniel Branden.&lt;ref name="teachout"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Teachout |first=Terry |date=July 1986 |title=The Goddess That Failed |work=Commentary |url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/the-passion-of-ayn-rand--by-barbara-branden-7163}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, psychologist [[Albert Ellis]], in the wake of a public debate with Nathaniel Branden, published a book arguing that Objectivism was a religion, whose practices included "sexual Puritanism," "absolutism," "damning and condemning," and "deification" of Ayn Rand and her fictional heroes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Is Objectivism A Religion? |last=Ellis |first=Albert |authorlink=Albert Ellis |location=New York |publisher=Lyle Stuart |year=1968}} Ellis did not employ the word "cult."&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoirs, Nathaniel Branden said of the Collective and NBI that "there was a cultish aspect to our world [...] We were a group organized around a charismatic leader, whose members judged one another's character chiefly by loyalty to that leader and her ideas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Branden |first=Nathaniel |year=1989 |title=Judgment Day: My Years with Ayn Rand |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |page=256 |isbn=0-395-46107-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, libertarian author [[Murray Rothbard]] began privately circulating an essay on "The Sociology of the Ayn Rand Cult", in which he wrote:
{{quote|If the glaring inner contradictions of the [[Leninism|Leninist]] cults make them intriguing objects of study, still more so is the Ayn Rand cult&amp;nbsp;... [f]or not only was the Rand cult explicitly atheist, anti-religious, and an extoller of Reason; it also promoted slavish dependence on the guru in the name of independence; adoration and obedience to the leader in the name of every person's individuality; and blind emotion and faith in the guru in the name of Reason.&lt;ref name="Rothbard"&gt;{{cite web |first=Murray |last=Rothbard |authorlink=Murray Rothbard |title=The Sociology of the Ayn Rand Cult |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard23.html |accessdate=May 31, 2009}} Rothbard's essay was later revised and printed as a pamphlet by ''[[Liberty (libertarian magazine)|Liberty]]'' magazine in 1987, and by the Center for Libertarian Studies in 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rothbard also wrote that "the guiding spirit of the Randian movement was not individual liberty&amp;nbsp;... but rather personal power for Ayn Rand and her leading disciples."&lt;ref name="Rothbard"/&gt;

In the 1990s, [[Michael Shermer]] argued that the Objectivist movement displayed characteristics of religious cults such as the veneration and inerrancy of the leader; hidden agendas; financial and/or sexual exploitation; and the beliefs that the movement provides absolute truth and absolute morality. Shermer maintained that certain aspects of Objectivist epistemology and ethics promoted cult-like behavior:
{{quote|[A]s soon as a group sets itself up to be the final moral arbiter of other people's actions, especially when its members believe they have discovered absolute standards of right and wrong, it is the beginning of the end of tolerance, and thus reason and rationality. It is this characteristic more than any other that makes a cult, a religion, a nation, or any other group, dangerous to individual freedom. Its absolutism was the biggest flaw in Ayn Rand's Objectivism, the unlikeliest cult in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Why People Believe Weird Things]] |last=Shermer |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Shermer |chapter=The Unlikeliest Cult |year=1997 |publisher=W.H. Freeman and Company |location=New York |isbn=0-7167-3090-1}} This chapter is a revised version of {{cite journal |last= Shermer |first= Michael |authorlink= Michael Shermer |title= The Unlikeliest Cult in History |journal= [[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]] |volume= 2 |issue= 2 |pages= 74–81 |year= 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1999, Jeff Walker published ''The Ayn Rand Cult''. In one passage, Walker compared Objectivism to the [[Dianetics]] practices of [[Scientology]], which is considered by many to be a cult. Both, argues Walker, are totalist sets of beliefs that advocate "an ethics for the masses based on survival as a rational being." Walker continues, "Dianetics used reasoning somewhat similar to Rand's about the brain as a machine. ... Both have a higher mind reprogramming the rest of the mind." Walker further notes that both philosophies claim to be based on science and logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walker1999|p=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker's book has drawn criticism from Rand scholars. Chris Matthew Sciabarra criticized Walker's objectivity and scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sciabarra |first=Chris Matthew |authorlink=Chris Matthew Sciabarra |title=Books for Rand Studies | url=http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/essays/cult.htm |journal=Full Context |volume=11 |issue=4 |date=March–April 1999 |pages=9–11 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mimi Reisel Gladstein]] wrote that Walker's thesis is "questionable and often depends on innuendo, rather than logic."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=108}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[R. W. Bradford]] called it "merely annoying" for scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bradford |first=R.W. |journal=Liberty |volume=13 |issue=2 |title=Ayn Rant |date=February 1999 |url=http://www.libertysoft.com/liberty/reviews/70bradford2.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050211153421/http://www.libertysoft.com/liberty/reviews/70bradford2.html |archivedate=February 11, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The claims of cultism have continued in more recent years. In 2004, [[Thomas Szasz]] wrote in support of Rothbard's 1972 essay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=2004 |title=Faith in Freedom: Libertarian Principles and Psychiatric Practices |last=Szasz |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Szasz |pages=124–126 |location=New Brunswick, New Jersey |publisher=Transaction Books |isbn=0-7658-0244-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2006, Albert Ellis published an updated edition of his 1968 book that included favorable references to Walker's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Are Capitalism, Objectivism, and Libertarianism Religions? Yes! |last=Ellis |first=Albert |location=Santa Barbara, California |publisher=Walden Three |year=2006 |isbn=1-4348-0885-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Walter Block]], while expressing admiration for some of Rand's ideas and noting her strong influence on [[libertarianism]], described the Objectivist movement as "a tiny imploding cult."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Block |first=Walter |date=Summer 2000 |url=http://www.reasonpapers.com/pdf/26/rp_26_4.pdf |title=Libertarianism vs Objectivism; A Response to Peter Schwartz |work=Reason Papers |issue=26 |page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responses===
Rand stated that "I am not a cult",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-q7cje1I3VM |title=Ayn Rand Phil Donahue Part 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said in 1961 that she did not want "blind followers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rand |first=Ayn |title=[[Letters of Ayn Rand]] |editor-first=Michael S. |editor-last=Berliner |location=New York |publisher=Dutton |year=1995 |isbn=0-525-93946-6 |page=592}} In a letter to Ida Macken (December 10, 1961), Rand wrote, "A ''blind follower'' is precisely what my philosophy condemns and what I reject. Objectivism is not a mystic cult." (emphasis in original)&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of NBI's collapse, she declared that she did not even want an organized movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1968a|p=471}} "I want, therefore, to make it emphatically clear that Objectivism is not an organized movement and is not to be regarded as such by anyone."&lt;/ref&gt;

Jim Peron responded to Shermer, Rothbard and others with an argument that similarities to cults are superficial at best and charges of cultism directed at Objectivists are ''[[ad hominem]]'' attacks. Objectivism, he said, lacks layers of initiation, a hierarchy, obligation, cost or physical coercion:
{{quote|I cannot see how a disembodied philosophy can be a cult. I say Objectivism was disembodied because there was no Objectivist organization to join. The Nathaniel Branden Institute gave lectures, but had no membership. You could subscribe to a newsletter but you couldn't join. Objectivism was, and is, structureless. And without a structure there cannot be cult. [...] The vast majority of self-proclaimed Objectivists are people who read Rand's works and agreed with her. Most have never attended an Objectivist meeting nor subscribed to any Objectivist newsletter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peron |first=Jim |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021014162005/http://www.zolatimes.com/V4.31/obj_cult4.html |url=http://www.zolatimes.com/V4.31/obj_cult4.html |title=Is Objectivism a Cult? Part 4: Understanding Cults |journal=The Laissez-Faire City Times |volume=4 |issue=31 |date=July 31, 2000 |accessdate=July 29, 2009 |archivedate=October 14, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2001, Rand's long-time associate Mary Ann Sures remarked:
{{quote|Some critics have tried to turn her certainty into a desire on her part to be an authority in the bad sense, and they accuse her of being dogmatic, of demanding unquestioning agreement and blind loyalty. They have tried, but none successfully, to make her into the leader of a cult, and followers of her philosophy into cultists who accept without thinking everything she says. This is a most unjust accusation; it's really perverse. ''Unquestioning agreement is precisely what Ayn Rand did not want.'' She wanted you to think and act independently, not to accept conclusions because she said so, but because you reached them by using your mind in an independent and firsthand manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Facets of Ayn Rand |last1=Sures |first1=Mary Ann |last2=Sures |first2=Charles |location=Los Angeles |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute Press |year=2001 |isbn=0-9625336-5-3 |url=http://www.facetsofaynrand.com/ |lastauthoramp=y |page=29}} (emphasis in original)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Meanwhile, Shermer, who considers himself an admirer of Rand, has tempered his judgment. Contrasting Leonard Peikoff's "heavy-hammer approach" with the "big-tent approach" of The Atlas Society, Shermer told Ed Hudgins: "If we're close enough on the same page about many things, I think it's more useful to cut people some slack, rather than going after them on some smaller points. I don't see the advantage of saying, 'You shouldn't have liked that movie because ultimately, if you were an Objectivist, you wouldn't have.' I guess it was those sorts of judgments made by some Objectiv[ists] that I objected to."&lt;ref name="shermertni"&gt;{{cite web |first=Edward |last=Hudgins |title=Interview with Michael Shermer |date=January–February 2007 |work=The New Individualist |publisher=The Objectivist Center |url=http://www.atlassociety.org/tni/tnis-interview-michael-shermer |accessdate=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Middle Ages]] [[antisemitism in Europe]] was [[Religious antisemitism|religious]]. Although not part of [[Dogma in the Catholic Church|Catholic dogma]], many Christians, including members of the [[clergy]], held the Jewish people collectively responsible for killing [[Jesus]]. As stated in the ''[[Boston College]] Guide to Passion Plays'', "Over the course of time, Christians began to accept … that the Jewish people as a whole were responsible for killing Jesus. According to this interpretation, both the Jews present at Jesus Christ's death and the Jewish people collectively and for all time, have committed the sin of [[Jewish deicide|deicide]], or "god-killing". For 1900 years of Christian-Jewish history, the charge of deicide has led to hatred, violence against and murder of Jews in [[Europe]] and [[Americas|America]]."&lt;ref name=Paley&gt;Paley, Susan, and Koesters, Adrian Gibbons, eds.

During the [[High Middle Ages]] in [[Europe]] there was full-scale persecution in many places, with [[blood libel]]s, expulsions, [[forced conversion]]s and [[wiktionary:massacre|massacres]]. An underlying source of prejudice against Jews in Europe was religious. Jews were frequently massacred and exiled from various European countries.  The persecution hit its first peak during the [[Crusades]]. In the [[First Crusade]] (1096) flourishing communities on the [[Rhine River|Rhine]] and the [[Danube River|Danube]] were utterly destroyed, a prime example being the [[Rhineland massacres]]. In the [[Second Crusade]] (1147) the Jews in [[France]] were subject to frequent massacres. The Jews were also subjected to attacks by the [[Shepherds' Crusade (1251)|Shepherds' Crusades of 1251]] and [[Shepherds' Crusade (1320)|1320]]. The Crusades were followed by expulsions, including in 1290, [[Edict of Expulsion|the banishing of all English Jews]]; in 1396, 100,000 Jews were expelled from France; and, in 1421 thousands were expelled from [[Austria]]. Many of the expelled Jews fled to [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holocaustcenterpgh.net/2-3.html |title=Why the Jews? – Black Death |publisher=Holocaustcenterpgh.net |date= |accessdate=2011-11-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429065613/http://www.holocaustcenterpgh.net/2-3.html |archivedate=2007-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[Black Death]] epidemics devastated Europe in the mid-14th century, annihilating more than a half of the population, Jews were taken as [[scapegoat#Political/sociological scapegoating|scapegoats]]. Rumors spread that they caused the disease by deliberately [[well poisoning|poisoning wells]]. Hundreds of Jewish communities were destroyed by violence in the [[Black Death persecutions]]. Although [[Pope Clement VI]] tried to protect them by [[papal bull]] on July 6, 1348 - with another following later in 1348 - several months afterwards, 900 Jews were [[Strasbourg massacre|burnt alive in Strasbourg]], where the plague hadn't yet affected the city.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;See Stéphane Barry and Norbert Gualde, ''La plus grande épidémie de Histoire'' ("The greatest epidemics in history"), in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' magazine, n°310, June 2006, p.47 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study finds that Jewish persecutions and expulsions increased with negative economic shocks and climactic variations in Europe over the period 1100-1600.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Jewish Persecutions and Weather Shocks: 1100-1800|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecoj.12331/abstract|journal = The Economic Journal|date = 2015-09-01|issn = 1468-0297|pages = n/an/a|doi = 10.1111/ecoj.12331|language = en|first = Robert Warren|last = Anderson|first2 = Noel D.|last2 = Johnson|first3 = Mark|last3 = Koyama}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the study argue that this stems from people blaming Jews for misfortunes and weak rulers going after Jewish wealth in times of fiscal crisis. The authors propose several explanations for why Jewish persecutions significantly declined after 1600:
* (1) there were simply fewer Jewish communities to persecute by the 17th century;
* (2) improved agricultural productivity, or, better-integrated markets may have reduced vulnerability to temperature shocks;
* (3) the rise of stronger states may have led to more robust protection for religious and ethnic minorities;
* (4) there were fewer negative temperature shocks.
* (5) the impact of the Reformation and the Enlightenment may have reduced antisemitic attitudes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
In the [[Papal States]], which existed until 1870, Jews were required to live only in specified neighborhoods called [[ghetto]]s.  Until the 1840s, they were required to regularly attend sermons urging their conversion to Christianity.  Only Jews were taxed to support state [[boarding school]]s for Jewish converts to Christianity.  It was illegal to convert from Christianity to Judaism.  Sometimes Jews were baptized involuntarily, and, even when such baptisms were illegal, forced to practice the Christian religion.  In many such cases, the state separated them from their families, of which the [[Edgardo Mortara]] account is one of the most widely publicized instances of acrimony between Catholics and Jews in the Papal States in the second half of the 19th century.

[[File:Banu Qurayza.png|thumb|200px|The [[Banu Qurayza|massacre of the Jewish Banu Qurayza]] in Arabia.]]
According to Mark R. Cohen, during the rise of [[Islam]], the first encounters between [[Muslim]]s and Jews resulted in friendship when the Jews of [[Medina]] gave [[Muhammad]] refuge. Conflict arose when Muhammad expelled certain Jewish tribes after they refused to swear their allegiance to him and aided the Meccan Pagans. He adds that this encounter was an exception rather than a rule.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Mark R. ''Under Crescent and Cross: The Jews in the Middle Ages'', [[Princeton University Press]], 1994, p. 163. {{ISBN|0-691-01082-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, Jews living in Muslim lands, known as [[dhimmis]], were allowed to practice their religion and administer their internal affairs but were subjects to certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Lewis|Lewis, Bernard]] (1984). ''The Jews of Islam''. Princeton: Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-00807-8}} pp.10,20&lt;/ref&gt; They had to pay the [[jizya]] (a per capita tax imposed on free adult non-Muslim males) to Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1984), pp.10,20&lt;/ref&gt; Dhimmis had an inferior status under Islamic rule. They had several social and legal [[Disabilities (Jewish)|disabilities]] such as prohibitions against bearing arms or giving testimony in courts in cases involving Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1987), p. 9, 27&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to popular belief, the [[Qur'an]] did not allow Muslims to force Jews to wear distinctive clothing. [[Obadiah the Proselyte]] reported in 1100 AD, that the [[Caliph]] had created this rule himself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Scheiber|Scheiber, A.]] "The Origins of Obadiah, the Norman Proselyte" ''Journal of Jewish Studies'' (Oxford), Vol. 5, 1954, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Resentment toward Jews perceived as having attained too lofty a position in Islamic society also fueled antisemitism and massacres. In [[Moorish Spain]], ibn Hazm and [[Abu Ishaq]] focused their anti-Jewish writings on this allegation. This was also the chief motivation behind the [[1066 Granada massacre]], when "[m]ore than 1,500 Jewish families, numbering 4,000 persons, fell in one day",&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=412&amp;letter=G&amp;search=Granada Granada] by Richard Gottheil, [[Meyer Kayserling]], ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''. 1906 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Fes, Morocco|Fez]] in 1033, when 6,000 Jews were killed.&lt;ref name=Morris10&gt;[[Benny Morris|Morris, Benny]]. ''Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist–Arab Conflict, 1881–2001''. Vintage Books, 2001, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; There were further massacres in Fez in 1276 and 1465.&lt;ref&gt;Gerber (1986), p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Zaydi|Zaydi imamate]] of [[Yemen]], Jews were also singled out for discrimination in the 17th century, which culminated in the general expulsion of all Jews from places in Yemen to the arid coastal plain of [[Tihamah]] and which became known as the [[Mawza Exile]].&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ, ''Ketavim''  (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, pp. 714-ff.

The [[Damascus affair]] occurred in 1840 when a French [[monk]] and his servant disappeared in [[Damascus]]. Immediately following, a charge of [[ritual murder]] was brought against a large number of Jews in the city including children who were tortured. The consuls of the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and [[Germany]] as well as [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] authorities, Christians, Muslims and Jews all played a great role in this affair.&lt;ref&gt;Frankel, Jonathan: ''The Damascus Affair: 'Ritual Murder', Politics, and the Jews in 1840'' (Cambridge University Press, 1997) {{ISBN|0-521-48396-4}} p.1&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the Damascus affair, [[Pogroms]] spread through the Middle East and North Africa. Pogroms occurred in: Aleppo (1850, 1875), Damascus (1840, 1848, 1890), Beirut (1862, 1874), Dayr al-Qamar (1847), Jerusalem (1847), Cairo (1844, 1890, 1901–02), Mansura (1877), Alexandria (1870, 1882, 1901–07), Port Said (1903, 1908), Damanhur (1871, 1873, 1877, 1891), Istanbul (1870, 1874), Buyukdere (1864), Kuzguncuk (1866), Eyub (1868), Edirne (1872), Izmir (1872, 1874).&lt;ref&gt;Yossef Bodansky.

There was a massacre of Jews in [[Baghdad]] in 1828.&lt;ref name="Morris10"/&gt; There was another massacre in Barfurush in 1867.&lt;ref name=Morris10/&gt;

In 1839, in the eastern [[Persia]]n city of [[Meshed]], a mob burst into the [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Jewish Quarter]], burned the synagogue, and destroyed the [[Sefer Torah|Torah scrolls]]. This is known as the [[Allahdad incident]]. It was only by forcible conversion that a massacre was averted.&lt;ref name="Patai"&gt;{{cite book |last=Patai |first=Raphael |title=Jadid al-Islam: The Jewish "New Muslims" of Meshhed |publisher=Wayne State University Press |year=1997 |location=Detroit |isbn=0-8143-2652-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Palestine there were riots and pogroms against Jews in [[1920 Nebi Musa riots|1920]] and [[Jaffa riots|1921]]. Tensions over the [[Western Wall]] in Jerusalem led to the [[1929 Palestine riots]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ovendale |first=Ritchie |title=The Origins of the Arab–Israeli Wars |year=2004 |publisher=[[Pearson Education]] |isbn=0-58282320-X |pages=g.71 |chapter=The "Wailing Wall" Riots |quote=The Mufti tried to establish Muslim rights and the Jews were deliberately antagonized by building works and noise.}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose [[1929 Hebron massacre|main victims]] were the ancient Jewish community at Hebron which came to an end.

In 1941, following [[Rashid Ali]]'s pro-[[Axis Powers|Axis]] coup, riots known as the ''[[Farhud]]'' broke out in [[Baghdad]] in which approximately 180 Jews were killed and about 240 were wounded, 586 Jewish-owned businesses were looted and 99 Jewish houses were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Itamar (2001).

During the [[Holocaust]], the [[Middle East]] was in turmoil. Britain prohibited Jewish immigration to the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]]. In [[Cairo]] the Jewish [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] (also known as the Stern Gang) assassinated [[Lord Moyne]] in 1944 fighting as part of its campaign against British closure of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] to Jewish immigration, complicating British-Arab-Jewish relations. While the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] were fighting for the [[oil]]-rich region, the Mufti of Jerusalem [[Amin al-Husayni]] staged a pro-Nazi coup in [[Iraq]] and organized the [[Farhud]] pogrom which marked the turning point for about 150,000 Iraqi Jews who, following this event and the hostilities generated by the [[1948 Arab–Israeli war|war with Israel in 1948]], were targeted for violence, persecution, boycotts, confiscations, and near complete expulsion in 1951. The coup failed and the mufti fled to [[Berlin]], where he actively supported [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. In [[Egypt]], with a Jewish population of about 75,000, young [[Anwar Sadat]] was imprisoned for conspiring with the Nazis and promised them that "no British soldier would leave Egypt alive" (see [[Military history of Egypt during World War II]]) leaving the Jews of that region defenseless. In the French [[Vichy France|Vichy]] territories of [[Algeria]] and [[Syria]] plans had been drawn up for the liquidation of their Jewish populations were the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] powers to triumph.

The tensions of the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] were also a factor in the rise of animosity to Jews all over the Middle East, as hundreds of thousands of Jews fled as [[Jewish refugees|refugees]], the main waves being soon after the 1948 and 1956 wars. In reaction to the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956, the Egyptian government expelled almost 25,000 Egyptian Jews and confiscated their property, and sent approximately 1,000 more Jews to prisons and detention camps. The population of Jewish communities of Muslim Middle East and North Africa was reduced from about 900,000 in 1948 to less than 8,000 today.

On March 2, 1974, the bodies of four [[Syrian Jewish]] girls were discovered by border police in a cave in the [[Zabdani Mountains]] northwest of Damascus. Fara Zeibak 24, her sisters Lulu Zeibak 23, Mazal Zeibak 22 and their cousin Eva Saad 18, had contracted with a band of smugglers to flee from Syria to Lebanon and eventually to Israel. The girl’s bodies were found raped, murdered and mutilated. The police also found the remains of two Jewish boys, Natan Shaya 18 and Kassem Abadi 20, victims of an earlier massacre.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Saul S. (1989).

[[File:Massacre of Jews in Lietūkis garage.jpeg|thumb|[[Kaunas pogrom]] in [[German occupation of Lithuania during World War II|German-occupied Lithuania]], June 1941]]
The persecution of Jews reached its most destructive form in the policies of [[Nazi Germany]], which made the destruction of the Jews a priority, culminating in the killing of approximately 6,000,000 Jews during [[the Holocaust]] from 1941 to 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucy Dawidowicz|Dawidowicz, Lucy]]. ''The War Against the Jews'', Bantam, 1986.p. 403&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally, the Nazis used death squads, the [[Einsatzgruppen]], to conduct massive open-air killings of Jews in territory that they conquered. By 1942, the Nazi leadership decided to implement the [[Final Solution]], the [[genocide]] of the Jews of [[Europe]], and to increase the pace of the Holocaust by establishing [[extermination camps]] specifically to kill Jews as well as other undesirables such as people who openly opposed Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;Manvell, Roger ''Goering'' New York:1972 Ballantine Books – War Leader Book #8 Ballantine's Illustrated History of the Violent Century&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6724481.stm |title=Ukrainian mass Jewish grave found |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-06-05 |accessdate=2011-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was an industrial method of genocide. Millions of Jews who had been confined to diseased and massively overcrowded [[ghettos]] were transported (often by train) to [[extermination camps|death camps]], where some were herded into a specific location (often a [[gas chamber]]), then killed with either gassing or shooting. Other prisoners simply committed suicide, unable to go on after witnessing the horrors of camp life.  Afterward, their bodies were often searched for any valuable or useful materials, such as [[gold]] fillings or [[hair]], and their remains were then buried in mass graves or burned. Others were interned in the camps where they were given little food and disease was common.&lt;ref name=Berenbaum103&gt;Berenbaum, Michael. ''The World Must Know," United States Holocaust Museum'', 2006, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Escapes from the camps were few, but not unknown. The few [[Auschwitz]] escapes that succeeded were made possible by the Polish underground inside the camp and local people outside.&lt;ref name=Linn20&gt;[[Ruth Linn|Linn, Ruth]]. ''Escaping Auschwitz. A culture of forgetting'', Cornell University Press, 2004, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, the Auschwitz commandant reported that "the local population is fanatically Polish and … prepared to take any action against the hated [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] camp personnel. Every prisoner who managed to escape can count on help the moment he reaches the wall of a first Polish farmstead."&lt;ref name=Swiebocki505&gt;Swiebocki, Henryk.

===Czarist Russia===
{{main|Antisemitism in the Russian Empire}}
For much of the 19th century, [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]], which included much of [[Poland]], [[Ukraine]], [[Moldova]] and [[Baltic states]], contained the world's largest Jewish population. From [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]]'s reign until the end of [[Tsar]]ist rule in Russia, many Jews were often restricted to the Jewish [[Pale of Settlement]] and they were also banned from many jobs and locations.  Jews were subject to racist laws, such as the [[May Laws]], and they were also targeted in hundreds of violent anti-Jewish riots, called [[pogrom]]s, which received unofficial state support. It was during this period that a hoax document alleging a global Jewish [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy]], ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', was created.

The Czarist government implemented programs which ensured that the Jews would remain isolated. However, the government tolerated their religious and national institutions as well as their right to emigrate. The restrictions and discriminatory laws drove many Russian Jews to embrace [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[Socialism|socialist]] causes. However, following the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] many politically active Jews forfeited their Jewish identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/the-jews-in-the-soviet-union-since-1917--by-nora-levin--the-jews-of-the-soviet-union--by-benjamin-pinkus-7646nska4.html |title=The Jews in the Soviet Union Since 1917, by Nora Levin; The Jews of the Soviet Union, by Benjamin Pinkus |publisher=Commentarymagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-22 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Leon Trotsky]],

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Jews] considered themselves neither Jews nor Russians but socialists. To them, Jews were not a nation but a class of exploiters whose fate it was to dissolve and assimilate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the aftermath of Czarist Russia, Jews found themselves in a tragic predicament. Conservative Russians saw them as a disloyal and subversive element and the radicals viewed the Jews as a doomed social class.&lt;ref&gt;The Jews in the Soviet Union Since 1917, Nora Levin&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Union===
{{main|Antisemitism in the Soviet Union}}
Even though many of the [[Old Bolshevik]]s were ethnically Jewish, they sought to uproot [[Judaism]] and [[Zionism]] and established the ''[[Yevsektsiya]]'' in order to achieve this goal. By the end of the 1940s, the [[Communist]] leadership of the former [[Soviet Union|USSR]] had liquidated almost all Jewish organizations, with the exception of a few [[tokenism|token]] [[synagogue]]s. These synagogues were then placed under police surveillance, both openly and through the use of informants{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}.

The campaign of 1948–1953 against so-called "[[rootless cosmopolitan]]s," the alleged "[[Doctors' plot]]," the rise of "[[Zionology]]" and subsequent activities of official organizations such as the [[Anti-Zionist committee of the Soviet public]] were officially carried out under the banner of "[[anti-Zionism]],", and by the mid-1950s the state persecution of Soviet Jews emerged as a major [[human rights]] issue in the West as well as domestically.

==Apartheid South Africa==
{{Main|Antisemitism in South Africa}}
During the 1930s, many Nationalist Party leaders and wide sections of the [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner people]] came strongly under the influence of the Nazi movement which dominated Germany from 1933 to 1945. There were many reasons for this. Germany was the traditional enemy of [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and whoever opposed Britain was seen as a friend of the Nationalists. Many Nationalists, moreover, believed that the opportunity to re-establish their lost republic would come with the defeat of the [[British Empire]] in the international arena. The more belligerent Hitler became, the higher hopes rose that a new era of Afrikanerdom was about to dawn.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715031456/http://www.anc.org.za/books/reich4.html|title=The Rise of the South African Reich - Chapter 4|date=15 July 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] of D F Malan closely associated itself with the policies of the Nazis. Jewish immigration from [[Eastern Europe]] was controlled under the Aliens Act and it soon came to an end during this period. Although Jews were accorded status as Europeans, they were not accepted into white society. The Kelvin Grove sports club, for example, had an exclusive Europeans Only and No Jews policy until recent times. Some 11 such sports clubs had similar policies. Many Jews lived in mixed race areas such as District Six, from where they were forcibly removed in order to make way for a whites-only development.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In 1936, [[Hendrick Verwoerd]] joined a deputation of six professors who were protesting against the admission to South Africa of Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany. Following the demands of the Nationalist Party, Eric Louw, later Foreign Minister, introduced another anti-Semitic bill that strongly resembled Nazi legislation - the Aliens Amendment and Immigration Bill of 1939. His bill was a means of suppressing all Jews. This bill suggested that Jews threatened to overpower [[Protestantism|Protestants]] in the business world, that they were innately cunning and manipulative and that they were also a danger to society. To support his claim, Louw maintained that Jews were involved in the [[Russian Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]] and therefore intended to spread [[Communism]] worldwide. This bill defined Jews as anyone with parents who were at least partly Jewish regardless of actual religious faith or practices." &lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Lee Jamison, The Nazi Influence in the Formation of Apartheid in South Africa, Concord Review
&lt;/ref&gt;

Another organization with which the Nationalists found much in common during the thirties was the 'South African Gentile National Socialist Movement', headed by [[Johannes von Strauss von Moltke]], whose objective was to combat and destroy the alleged 'perversive influence of the Jews in [[economics]], [[culture]], [[religion]], [[ethics]], and [[Power (international relations)|statecraft]] and to re-establish European [[Aryan race|Aryan]] control in South Africa for the welfare of the Christian peoples of South Africa'.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;

During the 1960s, [[Oswald Mosley]], the British fascist leader, was a frequent visitor to South Africa, where he was received by the Prime Minister and other members of the Cabinet. At one time, Mosley had two functioning branches of his organization in South Africa, and one of his supporters, Derek Alexander, was stationed in [[Johannesburg]] as his main agent.

Upon Verwoerd's [[assassination]] in 1966, [[BJ Vorster]] was elected by the National Party to replace him. While Vorster had been a supporter of Hitler during WWII, his policy towards Jews in his own country, however, can best be described as ambivalent.
 
The 1980s saw the rise of [[Far-right politics|far-right]] [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] groups such as the [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]] under [[Eugene Terreblanche]]. The AWB modeled itself after Hitler's National Socialist Party replete with fascist regalia and an emblem resembling the [[swastika]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Several officially sanctioned antisemitic campaigns took place in the Soviet Union, most notably the [[Doctor's Plot]] and the struggle against the "[[rootless cosmopolitans]]". However, the entire Jewish population was never openly and officially declared the [[enemy of the people]].&lt;ref name="Sarnov"/&gt; Instead, several [[euphemism]]s were used, such as [[zionists]], [[rootless cosmopolitans]] and "persons of Jewish ethnicity". There was an important distinction between these words: ''zionist'' and ''rootless cosmopolitans'' served as a label for "bad Jews" as enemies of the state, whereas "persons of Jewish ethnicity" was a [[politically correct]] expression for good, loyal Jews who were called by some ordinary folks as ''trained'' Jews (the original Russian word "дресированные" (dressage) typically refers to animals trained to perform in circus).&lt;ref name="Sarnov"/&gt; However most people realized that all these euphemisms denoted ''all'' Jews. A dean of [[Marxism-Leninism]] department at one of Soviet Universities explained the policy to his students:&lt;ref name="Sarnov"/&gt;

{{Quotation|1=One of you asked if our current political campaign can be regarded as [[antisemitism|antisemitic]]. Comrade [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] said: "We hate Nazi not because they are Germans, but because they brought enormous suffering to our land". Same can be said about the Jews.}}

The analogous euphemism "person of Caucasian ethnicity" is used less frequently in modern Russian to refer to [[Racism in Russia#Peoples of the Caucasus|peoples of the Caucasus]], such as [[Georgians in Russia|Georgians]] or [[Armenians in Russia]].&lt;ref name="Sarnov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RFERL"/&gt;

The '''philosophy of human rights''' attempts to examine the underlying basis of the concept of [[human rights]] and critically looks at its content and justification. Several theoretical approaches have been advanced to explain how and why the concept of human rights developed.

One of the oldest Western philosophies on human rights is that they are a product of a natural law, stemming from different philosophical or religious grounds. Other theories hold that human rights codify moral behavior which is a human social product developed by a process of biological and social evolution (associated with [[David Hume|Hume]]). Human rights are also described as a sociological pattern of rule setting (as in the sociological theory of law and the work of [[Max Weber|Weber]]). These approaches include the notion that individuals in a society accept rules from legitimate authority in exchange for security and economic advantage (as in [[John Rawls|Rawls]]) – a social contract. The two theories that dominate contemporary human rights discussion are the interest theory and the will theory. Interest theory argues that the principal function of human rights is to protect and promote certain essential human interests, while will theory attempts to establish the validity of human rights based on the unique human capacity for freedom.&lt;ref name="IEOP"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fagan|first=Andrew|title=Human Rights|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hum-rts/#SH4b|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural rights==

{{Main article|Natural law|Natural right}}

Natural law theories base human rights on a "natural" moral, religious or even biological order that is independent of transitory human laws or traditions.

[[Socrates]] and his philosophic heirs, [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], posited the existence of [[natural justice]] or natural right (δίκαιον φυσικόν ''dikaion physikon''; [[Latin]] ''ius naturale''). Of these, Aristotle is often said to be the father of natural law,&lt;ref&gt;Shellens (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; although evidence for this is due largely to the interpretations of his work by [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaffa (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of this tradition of natural justice into one of natural law is usually attributed to the [[Stoicism|Stoics]].&lt;ref&gt;Sills (1968, 1972) ''Natural Law''&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the early [[Church Fathers]] sought to incorporate the until then [[paganism|pagan]] concept of natural law into [[Christianity]]. Natural law theories have featured greatly in the [[philosophy|philosophies]] of [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Francisco Suárez]], [[Richard Hooker]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Hugo Grotius]], [[Samuel von Pufendorf]], and [[John Locke]].

In the 16th century, asked by the Spanish monarchs to investigate the legitimacy of claims to land dominion by the ''indios'' of Latin America, Francisco de Vitoria expounded a theory of natural rights, especially in his famous ''Relectio de Indis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Thomas D.|title=The Pre-Hobbesian Roots of Natural Rights Theory|url=http://www.uprait.org/archivio_pdf/ao7103-williams.pdf|publisher=Alpha Omega|accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century [[Thomas Hobbes]] founded a [[social contract|contractualist theory]] of [[legal positivism]] beginning from the principle that man in the state of nature, which is to say without a "commonwealth" (a state) is in a state of constant war one with the other and thus in fear of his life and possessions (there being no property nor right without a sovereign to define it). Hobbes asserted natural law as how a rational human, seeking to survive and prosper, would act; the first principle of natural law being to seek peace, in which is self-preservation. Natural law (which Hobbes accepted was a misnomer, there being no law without a commonwealth) was discovered by considering humankind's natural interests, whereas previous philosophers had said that natural rights were discovered by considering the natural law. In Hobbes' opinion, the only way natural law could prevail was for human beings to agree to create a commonwealth by submitting to the command of a sovereign, whether an individual or an assembly of individuals. In this lay the foundations of the theory of a social contract between the governed and the governor.

[[Hugo Grotius]] based his philosophy of international law on natural law. He wrote that "even the will of an [[omnipotence|omnipotent]] being cannot change or abrogate" natural law, which "would maintain its objective validity even if we should assume the impossible, that there is no [[God]] or that he does not care for human affairs." (''De iure belli ac pacis'', Prolegomeni XI). This is the famous argument ''etiamsi daremus'' (''non esse Deum''), that made natural law no longer dependent on theology.

[[John Locke]] incorporated natural law into many of his theories and philosophy, especially in ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''. Locke turned Hobbes' prescription around, saying that if the ruler went against natural law and failed to protect "life, liberty, and property," people could justifiably overthrow the existing state and create a new one.

The Belgian philosopher of law [[Frank Van Dun]] is one among those who are elaborating a secular conception&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.ugent.be/~frvandun/Texts/Logica/NaturalLaw.htm|author=van Dun, Frank|accessdate=28 December 2007 |title=Natural Law}}&lt;/ref&gt; of natural law in the liberal tradition. There are also emerging and secular forms of natural law theory that define human rights as derivative of the notion of universal human dignity.&lt;ref&gt;Kohen (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

"Dignity" is a key term for the discussion of human rights. The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] does not justify its claims on any philosophical basis, but rather it simply appeals to human dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theology and the Boundary Discourse of Human Rights|last = Regan|first = Ethna|publisher = Georgetown University Press|year = 2010|isbn = 978-1-58901-642-2|location = Washington D.C.|pages = 18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Rahner]] discusses human dignity as it relates to freedom. Specifically, his ideas of freedom relate to human rights as an appeal to the freedom to [[Karl Rahner#Incarnation-grace|communicate with the divine]]. As embodied individuals who can have this freedom and dignity threatened by external forces, the protection of this dignity takes on an appeal to protect human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theology and the Boundary Discourse of Human Rights|last = Regan|first = Ethna|publisher = Georgetown University Press|year = 2010|isbn = 978-1-58901-642-2|location = Washington, D.C.|pages = 85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "human rights" has replaced the term "natural rights" in popularity, because the rights are less and less frequently seen as requiring natural law for their existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Weston, Burns H.|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106289?query=human%20rights&amp;ct=eb|title=Human Rights|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online, p. 2|accessdate=18 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some, the debate on human rights remains thus a debate around the correct interpretation of Natural Law, and human rights themselves a positive, but reductionist, expression thereof&lt;ref&gt;Jakob Cornides, [http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&amp;context=jakob_cornides Natural and Un-Natural Law], New York, C-Fam (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social contract==

The English philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] suggested the existence of a hypothetical ''social contract'' where a group of free individuals agree for the sake of preservation to form institutions to govern them. They give up their natural complete liberty in exchange for protection from the Sovereign. This led to [[John Locke]]'s theory that a failure of the government to secure rights is a failure which justifies the removal of the government, and was mirrored in later postulation by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in his "Du Contrat Social" ([[The Social Contract]]).

International [[equity (law)|equity]] expert Paul Finn has echoed this view:

{{cquote|the most fundamental fiduciary relationship in our society is manifestly that which exists between the community (the people) and the state, its agencies and [[official]]s.|||Paul Finn&lt;ref name = "zogvfu"/&gt;}}

The relationship between government and the governed in countries which follow the [[English law]] tradition is a [[fiduciary]] one. In equity law, a politician's fiduciary obligations are not only the duties of good faith and loyalty, but also include duties of skill and [[competence (human resources)|competence]] in managing a country and its people. Originating from within the [[Court of equity|Courts of Equity]], the fiduciary concept exists to prevent those holding positions of power from abusing their authority. The fiduciary relationship between government and the governed arises from the governments ability to control people with the exercise of its power. In effect, if a government has the power to abolish any rights, it is equally burdened with the fiduciary duty to protect such an interest because it would benefit from the exercise of its own discretion to extinguish rights which it alone had the power to dispose of.&lt;ref name = "zogvfu"&gt;Salevao (2005) p.76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reciprocity==

The Golden Rule, or the ''[[ethic of reciprocity]]'' states that one must do unto others as one would be treated themselves; the principle being that reciprocal recognition and respect of rights ensures that one's own rights will be protected. This principle can be found in all the world's major religions in only slightly differing forms, and was enshrined in the "Declaration Toward a Global Ethic" by the [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] in 1993.

==Soviet concept of human rights==

{{Main article|Human rights in the Soviet Union}}

Soviet concept of human rights was different from conceptions prevalent in the West. According to Western legal theory, "it is the individual who is the beneficiary of human rights which are to be asserted ''against'' the government", whereas Soviet law declared that [[State (polity)|state]] is the source of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Lambelet, Doriane. "The Contradiction Between Soviet and American Human Rights Doctrine: Reconciliation Through Perestroika and Pragmatism." 7 ''Boston University International Law Journal''. 1989. p. 61-62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shiman&gt;{{cite book | last = Shiman | first = David | title = Economic and Social Justice: A Human Rights Perspective | publisher = Amnesty International | year= 1999 | url = http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/edumat/hreduseries/tb1b/Section1/tb1-2.htm | isbn = 0-9675334-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Soviet legal system regarded [[law]] as an arm of politics and courts as agencies of the government.&lt;ref name="Pipes"/&gt; Extensive [[Extrajudicial punishment|extra-judiciary powers]] were given to the [[Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies|Soviet secret police agencies]]. The regime abolished Western [[rule of law]], [[civil liberties]], [[Criminal justice|protection of law]] and [[Property rights|guarantees of property]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Pipes]] (2001) ''Communism'' Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. {{ISBN|0-297-64688-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Pipes]] (1994) ''Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime''. Vintage. {{ISBN|0-679-76184-5}}., pages 401–403.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Vladimir Lenin]], the purpose of [[People's court (Soviet Union)|socialist courts]] was "not to eliminate [[Red Terror|terror]] ... but to substantiate it and legitimize in principle".&lt;ref name="Pipes"/&gt;

Crime was determined not as the infraction of law, but as any action which could threaten the Soviet state and society. For example, [[Speculation|a desire to make a profit]] could be interpreted as a [[Counter-revolutionary|counter-revolutionary activity]] punishable by death.&lt;ref name="Pipes"/&gt; [[Dekulakization|The liquidation and deportation of millions peasants in 1928–31]] was carried out within the terms of Soviet Civil Code.&lt;ref name="Pipes"&gt;[[Richard Pipes]] ''Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime'', Vintage books, Random House Inc., New York, 1995, {{ISBN|0-394-50242-6}}, pages 402–403&lt;/ref&gt; Some Soviet legal scholars even asserted that "criminal repression" may be applied in the absence of guilt.".&lt;ref name="Pipes"/&gt; [[Martin Latsis]], chief of the Ukrainian [[Cheka]] explained: "Do not look in the file of incriminating evidence to see whether or not the accused rose up against the Soviets with arms or words. Ask him instead to which [[social class|class]] he belongs, what is his background, his [[education]], his [[profession]]. These are the questions that will determine the fate of the accused. That is the meaning and essence of the [[Red Terror]]."&lt;ref name="State"&gt;[[Yevgenia Albats]] and Catherine A. Fitzpatrick. ''The State Within a State: The KGB and Its Hold on Russia – Past, Present, and Future'', 1994. {{ISBN|0-374-52738-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of [[Show trial|public trials]] was "not to demonstrate the existence or absence of a crime – that was predetermined by the appropriate [[CPSU|party authorities]] – but to provide yet another forum for [[Soviet propaganda|political agitation and propaganda]] for the instruction of the citizenry (see [[Moscow Trials]] for example). Defense lawyers, who had to be [[CPSU|party members]], were required to take their client's guilt for granted..."&lt;ref name="Pipes"/&gt;

==Other theories of human rights==

The philosopher [[John Finnis]] argues that human rights are justifiable on the grounds of their instrumental value in creating the necessary conditions for human well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/h/hum-rts.htm#SH4b|title=''Human Rights''|publisher=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author=Fagan, Andrew|year=2006|accessdate=1 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finnis (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; Interest theories highlight the duty to respect the rights of other individuals on grounds of self-interest:

{{cquote|Human rights law, applied to a State's own citizens serves the interest of states, by, for example, minimizing the risk of violent resistance and protest and by keeping the level of dissatisfaction with the government manageable|||Niraj Nathwani in ''Rethinking refugee law''&lt;ref&gt;Nathwani (2003) p.25&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Biology|biological]] theory considers the comparative reproductive advantage of human social behavior based on empathy and [[altruism]] in the context of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnhart (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clayton, Schloss (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Miller, Paul (2001): Arnhart, Larry. ''Thomistic Natural Law as Darwinian Natural Right'' p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Human security}}
[[Human security]] is an emerging school of thought which challenges the traditional, state-based conception of security and argues that a people-focused approach to security is more appropriate in the modern interdependent world and would be more effective in advancing the security of individuals and societies across the globe.

;Ipso facto legal rights theory

According to the recommendation of human rights scholar Barrister Dr Mohammed Yeasin Khan LLB Honours, LLM, PhD, PGDL, Barrister-at-Law (Lincoln’s Inn), UK: ‘Right’ being synonymous of ‘legal’ and antonymous of both ‘wrong’ and ‘illegal’, every ‘right’ of any human person is ipso facto a ‘legal right’ which deserves protection of law and legal remedy irrespective of having been written into the law, constitution or otherwise in any country.&lt;ref&gt;Protection and Promotion of Human Rights for Peace and Development: Barrister Dr Mohammed Yeasin Khan LlB Honours, LLM, PhD, PGDL, Barrister-at-Law (Lincoln’s Inn), UK. [Page 63]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Man for man theory of world peace

According to Barrister Dr Mohammed Yeasin Khan: The only way ‘(a) to make the world terrorism and war free and also free from hunger, poverty, discrimination and exploitation; (b) to establish rule of law and economic, political and social justice; and (c) to confirm freedom of man, peace and development worldwide’ is protection and promotion human rights as ‘Ipso Facto Legal Rights’ and the unity of the world community in one and single theory of ‘man for man’ correlative, interdependent and ‘one to one-cum-one for other’ approach, namely, the ‘Man for Man Theory’ approach of world peace.&lt;ref&gt;Protection and Promotion of Human Rights for Peace and Development: Barrister Dr Mohammed Yeasin Khan, LLB Honours (London), LLM (Northumbria), PhD (CIU), PGDL (Northumbria), Barrister-at-Law (Lincoln’s Inn), UK [Page 70-71]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques of human rights==

The idea of [[human rights]] is not without its critics. [[Jeremy Bentham]], [[Edmund Burke]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Karl Marx]] are examples of historical philosophers who criticised the notion of [[natural rights]]. [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] is a leading contemporary critic of human rights. His criticisms are discussed below.

===Edmund Burke on natural rights===

[[Edmund Burke]] was an 18th-century philosopher, political theorist and statesman largely associated with the school of [[conservatism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hampsher-Monk|first=Iain|title=The political philosophy of Edmund Burke|year=1987|publisher=Longman|location=New Work|pages=preface, x}}&lt;/ref&gt; His views on [[natural rights]] are best articulated in ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'', which directly attacked the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen]]'' (1789) and its authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A great deal of Burke’s uneasiness of the ''Declaration'' lies in the drafter’s abandonment of the existing establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Burke, constitutional legitimacy was derived not from the Rousseauian doctrine of [[general will]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; but from a form of inherited wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Canavan|first=Francis P.|title=The Political Reason of Edmund Burke|year=1960|publisher=Duke University Press|location=London|pages=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that it was arrogant and limiting for the drafters of the ''Declaration'' to cast aside traditional notions that had stood the test of time.&lt;ref name="Burke"&gt;{{cite web|last=Burke|first=Edmund|title=Reflections on the Revolution in France 1790|url=http://www.constitution.org/eb/rev_fran.htm#01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“they have no respect for the wisdom of others; but they pay it off by a very full measure of confidence in their own”&lt;/ref&gt; Although it may seem to the drafters that they had abandoned the shackles of tradition, for Burke, they had limited their findings to the narrow minded conception of one person or group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mosher|first=Michael A.|title=The Skeptic's Burke: Reflections on the Revolution in Frabce, 1790-1990|journal=Political Theory|date=August 1991|volume=19|issue=3|pages=391–418 at 404|doi=10.1177/0090591791019003006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the grounding from which Burke’s attack of the ''Declaration'' is based.

Burke did not deny the existence of natural rights; rather he thought that the [[a priori (epistemology)|a priori]] reasoning adopted by the drafters produced notions that were too abstract to have application within the framework of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Canavan|first=Francis P.|title=The Political Reason of Edmund Burke|year=1960|publisher=Duke University Press|location=London|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; In stating that “the pretended right of these theorists are all extremes; and in a proportion as they are metaphysically true, they are morally and politically false”,&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt; Burke identified that abstract rights are meaningless without a societal framework:

{{cquote|What is the use of discussing a man’s abstract right to food or medicine? The question is upon the method of procuring and administering them.|||Edmund Burke&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt;}}

In contrast to [[John Locke|Locke]], Burke did not believe the purpose of government was to protect pre-existing natural rights;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Michael|title=Edmund Burke and the Critique of Political Radicalism|year=1980|publisher=Basil Blackwell Publisher|location=Oxford|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; he believed “the primitive rights of man undergo such a variety of refractions and reflections, that it becomes absurd to talk of them as if they continued in the simplicity of their original direction.”&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt; For Burke it was the government, as a result of long social evolution, that transformed the meaningless natural rights into the practical advantaged afforded to citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Canavan|first=Francis P.|title=The Political Reason of Edmund Burke|year=1960|publisher=Duke University Press|location=London|pages=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not the rights themselves, as much as the level of abstraction and the placing of them above government which Burke found dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Michael|title=Edmund Burke and the Critique of Political Radicalism|year=1980|publisher=Basil Blackwell Publisher|location=Oxford|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated “those who pull down important ancient establishments, who wantonly destroy modes of administration, and public institutions… are the most mischievous, and therefore the wickedest of men”.&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt; For Burke politics had no simple answers, and definitely no overarching, universal maxims such as those expressed in the ''Declaration''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather the rights afforded to individuals were to be assessed in the context of the social framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Canavan|first=Francis P.|title=The Political Reason of Edmund Burke|year=1960|publisher=Duke University Press|location=London|pages=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he acknowledged that the simplicity of the ''Declaration'' was attractive and feared its ability to undermine social order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Michael|title=Edmund Burke and the Critique of Political Radicalism|year=1980|publisher=Basil Blackwell Publisher|location=Oxford|pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke believed that the absolute nature of these principles of abstraction were inherently revolutionary; they were uncompromising and any derogation from the principles a reason to rise up in arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Michael|title=Edmund Burke and the Critique of Political Radicalism|year=1980|publisher=Basil Blackwell Publisher|location=Oxford|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a problem because;

{{cquote|All government… is founded on compromise and barter. We balance inconveniences; we give and take; we remit some rights, that we may enjoy others; and we choose rather to be happy citizens, than subtle disputants.|||Edmund Burke&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt;}}

The natural rights “Against which there can be no prescription; against these no agreements is binding”&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt; gave the revolutionaries the tools to destroy the very society that Burke believed afforded them with rights. In this way Burke thought the rights contained in the ''Declaration'' would lead to “the antagonist world of madness, discord, vice, confusion, and unavailing sorrow.”&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt;

===Jeremy Bentham on natural rights===

The 18th-century [[Utilitarian]] philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] criticised the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen]]'' in his text ''Anarchical Fallacies''. He famously asserted that the concept of natural rights was “nonsense upon stilts”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bentham|first=Jeremy|title=Anarchical Fallacies|url=http://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/lpw/documents/Bentham_Anarchical_Fallacies.pdf|page=line. 229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bentham criticised the ''Declaration'' both for the language that it adopted and the theories it posited, stating; “Look to the letter, you find nonsense; look beyond the letter, you find nothing.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bentham|first=Jeremy|title=Anarchical Fallacies|url=http://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/lpw/documents/Bentham_Anarchical_Fallacies.pdf|page=line.104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the critiques Bentham levelled against the ''Declaration'' was its assertions of rights in the form of absolute and universal norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; He identified that absolute rights possessed by everyone equally are meaningless and undesirable. They lack meaning because if everyone has, for example, unbounded liberty, there is nothing precluding them from using that liberty to impinge on the liberty of another.

In addition to this contradiction, Bentham warned of the dangers of couching rights in absolute terms. A government that is able to protect every person’s right absolutely and equally is a utopian aspiration, but the ''Declaration'' couches it as the conditions for its legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Against every government which fails in any degree of fulfilling these expectations, then, it is the professed object of this manifesto to excite insurrection.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parakh|first=Bhikhu|title=Bentham's Political Thought|year=1973|publisher=Croom Helm|location=London|pages=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bentham does not deny that there are some laws that are morally wrong; his uneasiness is in easily justifying a revolutionary call to arms – with the violence, chaos and destruction associated with it – based on a repugnant law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the theoretical faults, Bentham thought that natural rights were a construction adopted to pursue the selfish aims of the drafters, of which no logical basis could be found.&lt;ref name="Philip Schofield 1832"&gt;Philip Schofield, "Bentham, Jeremy (1748–1832)"; Ed. Donald M. Borchert, ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Vol. 1. 2nd ed. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2006) at 555&lt;/ref&gt; He acknowledged that it may be desirable to have rights, but “a reason for wishing that a certain right were established, is not that right; want is not supply; hunger is not bread.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bentham|first=Jeremy|title=Anarchical Fallacies|url=http://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/lpw/documents/Bentham_Anarchical_Fallacies.pdf|page=line 226}}&lt;/ref&gt; To establish rights existed by virtue of laws enacted by a sovereign was logically sound, but to assert rights established by nature was not.&lt;ref name="Philip Schofield 1832"/&gt; “A natural right is a son that never had a father.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only did Bentham think that there was no logical basis for the theory of natural rights, but he believed that their individualistic approach was harmful to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bentham thought that society was dependent upon people's ability to pursue the greater good, not just the short-term satisfaction of their own desires. The advancement of natural rights, which he saw as celebrating selfishness, was to provide the means to break down the social community that makes human life bearable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marxist Critique of human rights===
In [[On the Jewish Question]], [[Karl Marx]] criticized ''Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen'' as bourgeois ideology:
:''Above all, we note the fact that the so-called rights of man, the droits de l'homme as distinct from the droits du citoyen, are nothing but the rights of a member of civil society – i.e., the rights of egoistic man, of man separated from other men and from the community. ... according to the Declaration of the Rights of Man of 1791:
:''"Liberty consists in being able to do everything which does not harm others."''
:''Liberty, therefore, is the right to do everything that harms no one else. The limits within which anyone can act without harming someone else are defined by law, just as the boundary between two fields is determined by a boundary post.''
and that:
:''Security is the supreme social concept of bourgeois society, the concept of the police, the whole society exists only to ensure each of its members the preservation of his person, his rights and his property.''

Thus for Marx, liberal rights and ideas of justice are premised on the idea that each of us needs protection from other human beings. Therefore, liberal rights are rights of separation, designed to protect us from such perceived threats. Freedom on such a view, is freedom from interference. What this view denies is the possibility — according to Marx, the fact — that real freedom is to be found positively in our relations with other people. It is to be found in human community, not in isolation. So insisting on a regime of rights encourages us to view each other in ways which undermine the possibility of the real freedom we may find in human emancipation.

Marxist critical theorist [[Slavoj Žižek]] argued that: "liberal attitudes towards the other are characterized both by respect for otherness, openness to it, and an obsessive fear of harassment. In short, the other is welcomed insofar as its presence is not intrusive, insofar as it is not really the other. Tolerance thus coincides with its opposite. My duty to be tolerant towards the other effectively means that I should not get too close to him or her, not intrude into his space—in short, that I should respect his intolerance towards my over-proximity. This is increasingly emerging as the central human right of advanced capitalist society: the right not to be 'harassed', that is, to be kept at a safe distance from others." and "universal human rights are effectively the right of white, male property-owners to exchange freely on the market, exploit workers and women, and exert political domination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/against-human-rights-zizek |title=Against human rights - Slavoj Žižek |publisher=libcom.org|date=2010-02-19 |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British sociologist [[Robert Fine]] claims that the key to Marx’s argument was to rebut the radicalism Bauer espoused: a radicalism that not only denied the rights of Jews but at once trashed the rights of man and citizen as such. What Marx stood for in the Jewish Question as in his earlier writings more generally was a philosophy of right. Fine believes what Marx stood against was a spiritless radicalism that revealed its inhumanity not only through its hostility to Jews but also through its hostility to the idea of right." Moreover, Fine argued that Marx argued that the society that gives rise to the idea of rights is the same as that which gives rise to the commodity form. They are two sides of the same medal. It is a society based on production by independent producers whose contact with each other is mediated through the exchange of products on the market. These producers are formally free to produce what and how much they wish. They are formally equal in that no producer can force others to produce against their will or expropriate their products against their will. They are self-interested in that they are all entitled to pursue their own private interests regardless of what others think or do. Their contact with other producers takes the form of free and equal exchanges in which individuals exchange their property in return for the property of another and this exchange of unneeded things in return for useful things appears to be done for the mutual benefit of each party.

Fine also claims that for Marx, exchange relations appear to be formed among free and equal property owners who enter a voluntary contract in pursuit of their own self-interest. Fine cites what he believes to be Marx's point about how in exchange lies the clue to all modern conceptions of freedom and equal right:

:Although individual A feels a need for the commodity of individual B, he does not appropriate it by force, nor vice versa, but rather recognise one another reciprocally as proprietors, as persons whose will penetrates their commodities. Accordingly, the juridical moment of the Person enters here… all inherent contradictions of bourgeois society appear extinguished ... and bourgeois democracy even more than the bourgeois economists takes refuge in this aspect.: (Marx, Grundrisse:243, 251)

Furthermore, the parties to the exchange must place themselves in relation to one another as persons whose will resides in those objects and must behave in such a way that each does not appropriate the commodity of the other and alienate his own, except through an act to which both parties consent. Marx characterised this sphere of commodity exchange as ‘a very Eden of the innate rights of man’ – the realm of Freedom, Equality, Property and
Bentham:

:‘Freedom because both buyer and seller of a commodity ... are determined only by their own free will....Equality because each enters into relations with the other as with a simple owner of commodities and they exchange equivalent with equivalent. Property because each disposes only what is his own. And Bentham because each looks only to his own advantage. The only force bringing them together is the selfishness, the gain and the private interest of each.: (Marx, Capital 1: 280)

Thus according to [[Robert Fine]], Marx's basic criticism was that within political society people were seen as co-operative, while in their economic roles they were competitive, individualistic and egoistic. In short, the theory of rights expressed the division and alienation of human beings.

===Alasdair MacIntyre on human rights===

[[Alasdair MacIntyre]] is a Scottish philosopher who has published a number of works in a variety of philosophical fields, including [[political philosophy]], [[ethics]] and [[metaphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clayton|first1=Ted|title=Political Philosophy of Alasdair MacIntyre|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/p-macint/|work=Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|accessdate=31 December 2005 |editor1=James Fieser|editor2=Bradley Dowden}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacIntyre criticises the concept of [[human rights]] in [[After Virtue]] and he famously asserts that “there are no such rights, and belief in them is one with belief in witches and in unicorns.”&lt;ref name="MacIntyre 1981 67"&gt;{{cite book|last=MacIntyre|first=Alasdair|title=After Virtue|year=1981|publisher=Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co.|location=London|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacIntyre argues that every attempt at justifying the existence of human rights has failed. The assertions by 18th century philosophers that [[natural rights]] are self-evident truths, he argues, are necessarily false as there are no such things as self-evident truths. He says that the plea 20th century philosophers made to intuition show a flaw in philosophical reasoning. MacIntyre then outlines that, although [[Ronald Dworkin|Dworkin]] is not wrong in asserting that the inability to demonstrate a statement does not necessitate its falsity, the same argument can be applied in relation to witches and unicorns.&lt;ref name="MacIntyre 1981 67"/&gt;

MacIntyre made this critique of human rights in the context of a wider argument about the failure of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] to produce a coherent moral system.&lt;ref name="Knight 1998 70"&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Kelvin|title=The MacIntyre Reader|year=1998|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers of the enlightenment sought to cast aside the discredited notions of hierarchy and [[theology]] as justifications for morality. Instead, MacIntyre argues, the enlightenment placed the individual as the sovereign authority to dictate what is right and wrong. However allegiances to historical notions of morality remained and philosophers sought to find a secular and rational justification for existing beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacIntyre|first=Alasdair|title=After Virtue|year=1981|publisher=Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co.|location=London|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem, MacIntyre maintains, is that theological morality was developed to overcome defects in human nature; to posit an example of the ideal. Without this notion of ‘perfect humanity’ the only remaining foundation to build a moral theory on was the foundation of imperfect human nature.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. A. Garcia, "Modern(ist) Moral Philosophy and MacIntyrean Critique" in ed. Mark C. Murphy ''Alasdair MacIntyre'' (2003, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press) at pp 135–136&lt;/ref&gt; For MacIntyre, the result was a collection of moral stances, each claiming to have a rational justification and each disputing the findings of the rival notions.&lt;ref name="Knight 1998 70"/&gt;

MacIntyre believes that a number of the moral debates that occur in society can be explained as a result of this failure of the “Enlightenment Project”.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. A. Garcia, "Modern(ist) Moral Philosophy and MacIntyrean Critique" in ed. Mark C. Murphy ''Alasdair MacIntyre'' (2003, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press) at pp 96&lt;/ref&gt; Human rights are an example of a moral belief, founded in previous theological beliefs, which make the false claim of being grounded in rationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Kelvin|title=The MacIntyre Reader|year=1998|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate how the principles lead to conflict, he gives the example of [[abortion]]; in this case the right of the mother to exercise control over her body is contrasted with the deprivation of a potential child to the right to life. Although both the right to liberty and the right to life are, on their own, considered morally acceptable claims, conflict arises when we posit them against each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacIntyre|first=Alasdair|title=After Virtue|year=1981|publisher=Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co.|location=London|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory of value and property==
{{See also|Property}}
[[Henry of Ghent]] articulated the theory that every person has a property interest in their own body.&lt;ref&gt;Tierney (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Locke]] uses the word property in both broad and narrow senses. In a broad sense, it covers a wide range of human interests and aspirations; more narrowly, it refers to material goods. He argues that property is a natural right and it is derived from labour.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Locke]]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, property precedes government and government cannot "dispose of the estates of the subjects arbitrarily." To deny valid property rights according to Locke is to deny human rights. The British philosopher had significant impacts upon the development of the Government of the UK and was central to the fundamental founding philosophy of the United States. [[Karl Marx]] later critiqued Locke's theory of property in his ''Theories of Surplus Value'', seeing the beginnings of a theory of [[surplus value]] in Locke's works. In Locke's ''Second Treatise'' he argued that the right to own private property was unlimited as long as nobody took more than they could use without allowing any of their property to go to waste and that there were enough common resources of comparable quality available for others to create their own property. Locke did believe that some would be more "industrious and rational" than others and would amass more property, but believed this would not cause shortages. Though this system could work before the introduction of [[money]], Marx argued in ''Theories of Surplus Value'' that Locke's system would break down and claimed money was a contradiction of the law of nature on which private property was founded.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughn (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Basic Forms of government}}

A '''plutocracy''' ({{lang-el|πλοῦτος}}, ''{{transl|el|ploutos}}'', 'wealth' + {{lang|el|κράτος}}, ''{{transl|el|kratos}}'', 'rule') or '''plutarchy''' is a society that is ruled or controlled by people of great [[Wealth|wealth]] or [[Income|income]]. The first known use of the term in English dates from 1631.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plutocracy|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/plutocracy|publisher=Merriam Webster|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike systems such as [[democracy]], [[capitalism]], [[socialism]] or [[anarchism]], plutocracy is not rooted in an established [[political philosophy]]. The concept of plutocracy may be advocated by the wealthy classes of a society in an indirect or surreptitious fashion, though the term itself is almost always used in a [[pejorative]] sense.

==Usage==
The term ''plutocracy'' is generally used as a pejorative to describe or warn against an undesirable condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fiske|first=Edward B.|title=Fiske 250 words every high school freshman needs to know|year=2009|publisher=Sourcebooks|location=Naperville, Ill.|isbn=1402218400|pages=250|author2=Mallison, Jane |author3=Hatcher, David }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coates|first=ed. by Colin M.|title=Majesty in Canada: essays on the role of royalty|year=2006|publisher=Dundurn|location=Toronto|isbn=1550025864|pages=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout history, political thinkers such as [[Winston Churchill]], 19th-century French [[sociologist]] and [[historian]] [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], 19th-century Spanish [[monarchist]] [[Juan Donoso Cortés]] and today [[Noam Chomsky]] have condemned plutocrats for ignoring their [[Social responsibility|social responsibilities]], using their power to serve their own purposes and thereby increasing poverty and nurturing [[class conflict]], corrupting societies with [[greed]] and [[hedonism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Peter |last1=Viereck|title=Conservative thinkers: from John Adams to Winston Churchill|year=2006|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=New Brunswick, New Jersey|isbn=1412805260|pages=19–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Toupin|first=Alexis de Tocqueville; edited by Roger Boesche; translated by James|title=Selected letters on politics and society|year=1985|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0520057511|pages=197–198|author2=Boesche, Roger|authorlink2=Roger Boesche}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===
Historic examples of plutocracies include the [[Roman Empire]], some [[city-state]]s in [[Ancient Greece]], the civilization of [[Carthage]], the [[Italian city-states]]/[[merchant republic]]s of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], [[Republic of Florence|Florence]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], and the pre-World War II [[Empire of Japan]] (the ''[[zaibatsu]]''). According to [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Jimmy Carter]], the modern day [[United States]] resembles a plutocracy, though with democratic forms.&lt;ref name=NoamC1&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.salon.com/2015/10/06/noam_chomsky_america_is_a_plutocracy_masquerading_as_a_democracy_partner/ |first=Noam |last=Chomsky |authorlink=Noam Chomsky |title=America is a plutocracy masquerading as a democracy |date=6 October 2015 |newspaper=Salon |accessdate=13 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JimmyC1&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.supersoul.tv/supersoul-sunday/jimmy-carter-on-whether-he-could-be-president-today-absolutely-not |first=Jimmy |last=Carter |authorlink=Jimmy Carter |title=Jimmy Carter on Whether He Could Be President Today: "Absolutely Not"|date=15 October 2015 |newspaper=supersoul.tv|accessdate=13 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Chairman of the federal reserve, [[Paul Volcker]], also believes the US is developing into a plutocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/23/business/dealbook/paul-volcker-federal-reserve.html?smid=fb-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur |first=Andrew |last=Sorkin |authorlink=Sorkin |title=Paul Volcker, at 91, Sees ‘a Hell of a Mess in Every Direction’ |date=23 October 2018 |newspaper=New York Times |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One modern, formal example of a plutocracy, according to some critics{{source?|date=August 2018}}, is the [[City of London]].&lt;ref name=Guardian1&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/31/corporation-london-city-medieval |first=George |last=Monbiot |authorlink=George Monbiot |title=The medieval, unaccountable Corporation of London is ripe for protest |date=31 October 2011 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The City (also called the Square Mile of ancient [[London]], corresponding to the modern financial district, an area of about 2.5&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) has a unique electoral system for [[City of London Corporation|its local administration]], separate from London proper. More than two-thirds of voters are not residents, but rather representatives of businesses and other bodies that occupy premises in the City, with votes distributed according to their numbers of employees. The principal justification for this arrangement is that most of the services provided by the City of London Corporation are used by the businesses in the City. In fact about 450,000 non-residents constitute the city's day-time population, far outnumbering the City's 7,000 residents.&lt;ref name=tribune&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribunemagazine.org/2009/02/labour-runs-in-city-of-london-poll-against-%E2%80%98get-rich%E2%80%99-bankers// |title=Labour runs in City of London poll against ‘get-rich’ bankers |date=12 February 2009 |author=René Lavanchy |publisher=[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]] |accessdate=17 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115021037/http://www.tribunemagazine.org/2009/02/labour-runs-in-city-of-london-poll-against-%E2%80%98get-rich%E2%80%99-bankers// |archivedate=15 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] had been enacted in 1890, with large industries reaching [[Monopoly|monopolistic]] or near-monopolistic levels of [[market concentration]] and [[financial capital]] increasingly integrating corporations, a handful of very wealthy heads of large corporations began to exert increasing influence over industry, public opinion and politics after the Civil War. Money, according to contemporary [[Progressive movement|progressive]] and journalist [[Walter Weyl]], was "the mortar of this edifice", with ideological differences among politicians fading and the political realm becoming "''a mere branch'' in a still larger, integrated business. The state, which through the party formally sold favors to the large corporations, became one of their departments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowman|first=Scott R.|title=The modern corporation and American political thought: law, power, and ideology|year=1996|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park, Pa.|isbn=0271014733|pages=92–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[The Conscience of a Liberal]]'', in a section entitled The Politics of Plutocracy, [[economist]] [[Paul Krugman]]  says plutocracy took hold because of three factors: at that time, the poorest quarter of American residents (African-Americans and non-naturalized immigrants) were ineligible to vote, the wealthy funded the campaigns of politicians they preferred, and [[Electoral fraud#Vote buying|vote buying]] was "feasible, easy and widespread", as were other forms of [[electoral fraud]] such as [[Electoral fraud#Ballot stuffing|ballot-box stuffing]] and [[Electoral fraud#Intimidation|intimidation of the other party's voters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Krugman|first=Paul|title=The conscience of a liberal|year=2009|publisher=Norton|location=New York|isbn=0393333132|pages=21–26|edition=[Pbk. ed.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. instituted progressive taxation in 1913, but according to [[Shamus Khan]], in the 1970s, elites used their increasing political power to lower their taxes, and today successfully employ what political scientist Jeffrey Winters calls "the income defense industry" to greatly reduce their taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, Shamus (18 September 2012) [http://ideas.time.com/2012/09/18/the-rich-havent-always-hated-taxes/ "The Rich Haven’t Always Hated Taxes"] ''Time Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Nobel-Prize winning economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]] wrote the 2011 ''Vanity Fair'' magazine article entitled "Of the 1%, by the 1%, for the 1%", the title and content supported Stiglitz's claim that the United States is increasingly ruled by the wealthiest 1%.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz Joseph E.

{{Politics of Germany}}
The '''political culture of Germany''' as of the early 21st century is known for the popular expectation for governments to ensure a degree of [[social welfare]], business and labour corporatism and a multiparty system dominated by [[Conservatism|conservative]] and [[social democratic]] forces, with a strong influence of smaller [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green]], [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[socialism|socialist]] parties. Coalition governments are predominant on both the federal and the state level exemplifying the German desire for consensus politics instead of one party majority rule as in democracies that follow the [[Westminster system|Westminster model]]. Although this consensus culture is beneficial insofar as it enables minority groups to take part in political discussions and decision making, it often leads to situations in which different interest groups blockade each other resulting in political gridlocks. Political decision making is further complicated by the powers held by the German states and the presence of a judicial branch with the power to review and dismiss legislation. Therefore political power in Germany is not concentrated in the hands of one or a small number of individuals but spread thinly. Even the Chancellor can only set general guidelines for federal policies ([[Richtlinienkompetenz]]) and has to negotiate with many other politicians and interest groups when there is a need to take concrete measures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20966">'''Political theology''' investigates the ways in which [[Theology|theological]] concepts or ways of thinking relate to [[politics]], [[society]], and [[economics]]. It has often been affiliated with Christianity, but since the 21st century, it has more recently been discussed with relation to other religions.

== Terminology ==
The term "political theology" is often used to denote religious thought about political principled questions. Scholars such as [[Carl Schmitt]] use it to denote religious concepts that were secularized and thus became key political concepts.{{cn|date=September 2017}} Another term which often occupies similar space in academic discourse is "[[public theology]]". It is said that political theology is directed more towards the government or the state, whereas public theology is more towards [[civil society]].{{sfn|Bell|2015|p=117}}

== Developments ==
The term ''political theology'' has been used in a wide variety of ways by writers exploring different aspects of believers' relationship with politics. It has been used to discuss [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s ''[[The City of God (book)|City of God]]''{{sfnm |1a1=Doody |1a2=Hughes |1a3=Paffenroth |1y=2005 |2a1=Elshtain |2y=2004}} and [[Thomas Aquinas]]'s ''[[Summa Theologica]]''.{{sfn|Bauerschmidt|2004}} It has likewise been used to describe the [[Eastern Orthodox Church | Eastern Orthodox]] view of [[Symphonia (theology) | ''symphonia'']]{{sfn|McGuckin|2008|pp=391–395}} and the works of the [[Protestant Reformers|Protestant reformers]] [[Martin Luther]]{{sfn|Höpfl|1991|pp=xxii–xxiii}} and [[John Calvin]].{{sfn|Höpfl|1991}}{{page number|date=November 2017}} Though the political aspects of [[Christianity and politics|Christianity]], [[Political aspects of Islam|Islam]], [[Confucianism]], and other traditions has been debated for millennia, political theology has been an academic discipline since the 20th century.{{sfn|Bowker|2000}}

The recent use of the term is often associated with the work of [[Carl Schmitt]]. Writing amidst the turbulence of the [[Germany|German]] [[Weimar Republic]], Schmitt argued in his essay ''[[Carl Schmitt#Political Theology|Politische Theologie]]'' (1922){{sfn|Schmitt|2005}} that the main concepts of modern politics were secularized versions of older theological concepts. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] had used the term in his 1871 text "The Political Theology of Mazzini and the International"{{sfn|Marshall|1992|pp=300–301}} to which Schmitt's book was a response.{{sfnm |1a1=Maier |1y=1995 |1pp=75–76 |2a1=Schmitt |2y=2005 |2pp=64–66}} Drawing on [[Thomas Hobbes]] in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' he argued that the [[State (polity)|state]] exists to maintain its own integrity in order to ensure [[Social order|order in society]] in times of crisis.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Some{{who?|date=July 2017}} have divided the approach of political theology between a rightist traditional concern with individual "moral reform" (such as Clyde Wilcox's ''God's Warriors'' [1992] and Ted Jelen's ''The Political World of the Clergy'' [1993]) and a leftist focus on collective "social justice" (such as [[Jeffrey K. Hadden]]'s ''The Gathering Storm in the Churches'' [1969] and Harold Quinley's ''The Prophetic Clergy'' [1974]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Williams |first=Rhys H. |author-link=Rhys H. Williams (sociologist) |year=1998 |title=Political Theology on the Right and Left |url=http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=332 |magazine=The Christian Century |volume=115 |issue=21 |location=Chicago |pages=722–724 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608162549/http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=332 |archive-date=8 June 2013 |access-date=25 November 2017 |via=Religion Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kwok Pui-lan]] has argued that, while Schmitt may have come up with the term and its modern usage, political theologies were likewise forming along very different trajectories elsewhere around the world, such as in Asia. In China in the 1930s, for instance, the Protestant [[Y. T. Wu|Wu Yaozong]] advocated that a social revolution was necessary to save both China and the world.{{sfn|Kwok|2016}} This would likewise be true of the role of Protestants involved in Korean nationalism in the early twentieth century.{{sfn|Wells|1990}}

Many major non-Christian philosophers have written extensively on the topic of political theology during recent years, such as [[Jürgen Habermas]],{{sfn|Afrasiabi|1998}} [[Giorgio Agamben]], [[Simon Critchley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Critchley |first=Simon |author-link=Simon Critchley |date=1 February 2012 |title=Simon Critchley on 'The Faith of the Faithless: Experiments in Political Theology' |url=http://www.politicaltheology.com/blog/simon-critchley-on-the-faith-of-the-faithless-experiments-in-political-theology/ |website=Political Theology Today |access-date=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Slavoj Zizek]].{{sfn|Breger|2001}} Since the early 21st century, there has also been a growing discourse around [[Islam]]ic political theology, especially within Western contexts that were previously dominated by Christianity.{{sfn|Lloyd|2013}}{{sfn|Ghobadzadeh|2018}}

== By region ==
=== China ===
{{Main article|Political theology in China}}
Political theology in China includes responses from Chinese government leaders, scholars, and religious leaders who deal with the relationship between religion and politics. For two millennia, this was organized based on a Confucian understanding of religion and politics, often discussed in terms of Confucian political philosophy.{{sfn|Wong|2011}} At various points throughout its history, Chinese Buddhism presented an alternative to the political import of Confucianism. However, since the mid-twentieth century, [[Communist Party of China|communist]] understandings of religion have dominated the discourse.

For Christianity, this relationship can be seen from the religion's earliest encounters in the country during the imperial period, with the [[Church of the East in China|Church of the East]]'s interaction with the [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Emperor Taizong]] and [[Jesuit missions to China|Jesuit missionaries]] in the Ming court. But it has developed the most in the 20th and 21st centuries after the establishments of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] and [[People's Republic of China]], especially through the establishment of the [[Three-Self Patriotic Movement]] and rise of [[House church (China)|house church]]es.

=== Germany ===
The influence of the philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1770–1831) is also evident throughout much of German political theology. This is particularly clear in the work of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] theologian [[Johann Baptist Metz]] (born 1928) who explored the concept of political theology throughout his work.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://guweb2.gonzaga.edu/metz/ Johann-Baptist Metz]", ''The Vocabulary of Political Theology'', [[Gonzaga University]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{verification needed|date=November 2017}} He argued for the concept of a "suffering God" who shared the pain of his creation, writing, "Yet, faced with conditions in God's creation that cry out to heaven, how can the theology of the creator God avoid the suspicion of apathy unless it takes up the language of a suffering God?" This leads Metz to develop a theology that is related to [[Marxism]]. He criticizes what he terms bourgeois Christianity and believes that the Christian Gospel has become less credible because it has become entangled with bourgeois religion. His work ''Faith in History and Society'' develops apologetics, or fundamental theology, from this perspective.

Two of the other major developers of political theology in Germany were [[Jürgen Moltmann]] and [[Dorothee Sölle]]. As in Metz' work, the concept of a suffering God is important to Moltmann's theological program. Moltmann's political theology was influenced strongly by the Marxist philosopher [[Ernst Bloch]], and both Moltmann and Sölle were influenced heavily by [[liberation theology]], as was Metz. Another early influence was the [[Frankfurt School]] of [[critical theory]], especially [[Walter Benjamin]], and the Frankfurt School's broader critique of [[modernity]].{{sfn|Osborne|Charles|2015}}

=== Middle East ===
{{Main article|Political theology in the Middle East}}
Christian political theology in the [[Middle East]] is a religious response by Christian leaders and scholars to political problems.{{fact|date=March 2018}} Political theologians try to balance the demands of a tumultuous region with the delicate but long history of Christianity in the Middle East. This has yielded a diversity of political theology disproportionate to the small size of Middle East Christian minorities. The region's importance to Christians worldwide – both for history and doctrinal authority for many denominations – also shapes the political theologies of the Middle East.{{fact|date=March 2018}}

For many Christian leaders, the dominant approach to political theology is one of survival. Many [[Arab Christians]] see themselves as the heirs of a rich Christian heritage whose existence is threatened by regional unrest and religious persecution. Their chief political goal is survival, which sets their political theology apart.{{sfn|Wessels|1995|pp=203–227}}

At times, Arab Christian leaders have appealed to Christians outside the region through both denominational challenges and broader calls to Christian unity for humanitarian or political aid. In other cases, Christian politicians downplay their faith in the public sphere to avoid conflict with their Muslim neighbours.{{sfn|Cragg|1991|pp=143–227}}

In the mid-20th century, many Christians in the Middle East saw secular politics as a way out of their traditional status as a minority community in the Islamic world.{{sfn|Cragg|1991|pp=143–227}} Christians played prominent roles throughout the [[pan-Arabism|pan-Arab nationalist]] movement in the mid-20th century, where their experience with Western politics and generally high educational attainments made their contributions valuable to nationalist governments around the region. One prominent example was [[Michel Aflaq]], an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christian]] who formed the first [[Ba'ath Party|Ba'ath]] group from students in Damascus in the 1940s. His belief was that Christians should embrace Islam as part of their cultural identity because nationalism was the best way for Christians to be successful in the Middle East.{{sfn|Cragg|1991|pp=143–227}}

=== Sub-Saharan Africa ===
{{Main article|Political theology in sub-Saharan Africa}}
Political theology in sub-Saharan Africa deals with the relationship of theology and politics, arising from the [[internal resistance to apartheid|anti-apartheid struggle]] in [[South Africa]] and nationalist campaigns of the mid to late twentieth century elsewhere. The increasing numbers of Christians in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] has led to an increased interest in Christian responses to the region's continuing issues of poverty, violence, and war.{{sfn|Katongole|2010|pp=1–4, 22–23}} According to the Cameroonian theologian and sociologist [[Jean Marc Ela|Jean-Marc Éla]], African Christianity "has to be formulated from the struggles of our people, from their joys, from their pains, from their hopes and from their frustrations today."{{sfn|Stinton|2004|p=25}} African theology is heavily influenced by [[liberation theology]], global [[black theology]], and postcolonial theology.

Notable thinkers include [[Itumeleng Mosala]], [[Jesse Mugambi|Jesse N. K. Mugambi]], and [[Desmond Tutu]].

=== United States ===
[[Reinhold Niebuhr]] also developed a theology similar to Metz in the practical application of theology. During the 1930s, Niebuhr was a leader of the [[Socialist Party of America]], and although he broke with the party later in life socialist thought is a prominent component of his development of [[Christian Realism]]. The work by Niebuhr that best exemplifies his relationship with political theology is ''[[Moral Man and Immoral Society|Moral Man and Immoral Society: A Study of Ethics and Politics]]'' (1932).

One of the most influential developers of recent political theology is [[Stanley Hauerwas]], though he considers his work to be better termed a "theological politics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hauerwas |first=Stanley |author-link=Stanley Hauerwas |title=Bonhoeffer: The Truthful Witness |url=http://www.homileticsonline.com/subscriber/interviews/hauerwas.asp |website=Homiletics Online |access-date=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hauerwas has actively critiqued the political theology of both [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] and [[H. Richard Niebuhr]], and has been a frequently critic of Christians' attempt to attain political power and align themselves with secular political ideologies. Moreoever, he has been a severe critic of [[liberal democracy]], [[capitalism]], and [[militarism]], arguing that all of those ideologies are antithetical to Christian convictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Hauerwas |first=Stanley |author-link=Stanley Hauerwas |year=2002 |title=Stanley Hauerwas: An Interview |url=http://www.crosscurrents.org/Hauerwasspring2002.htm |magazine=Cross Currents |volume=52 |issue=1 |interviewer-last=Quirk |interviewer-first=Michael J. |access-date=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:VomStein (Gemälde Rincklake).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Karl Freiherr vom und zum Stein]]]]
[[File:Fürst Hardenberg.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Karl August von Hardenberg]].]]

The '''Prussian Reform Movement''' was a series of constitutional, administrative, social and economic reforms early in the nineteenth-century [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. They are sometimes known as the '''Stein-Hardenberg Reforms''', for [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein|Karl Freiherr vom Stein]] and [[Karl August Fürst von Hardenberg]], their main initiators. Before the Second World War, German historians, such as [[Heinrich von Treitschke]], saw the reforms as the first steps towards the [[unification of Germany]] and the foundation of the [[German Empire]].{{sfn|Dwyer|2014|p=255}}

The reforms were a reaction to the defeat of the Prussians by [[Napoleon I]] at [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|Jena-Auerstedt]] in 1806, leading to the [[Treaties of Tilsit|second Treaty of Tilsit]], in which Prussia lost about half its territory and was forced to make massive tribute payments to France. To make those payments, it needed to rationalize its administration. Prussia's defeat and subjection also demonstrated the weaknesses of its [[absolute monarchy]] model of statehood and excluded it from the great powers of Europe.

To become a great power again, it initiated reforms from 1807 onwards, based on [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas and in line with reforms in other European nations. They led to the reorganization of Prussia's government and administration and changes in its agricultural trade regulations, including the abolition of [[serfdom]] and allowing peasants to become landowners. In industry, the reforms aimed to encourage [[Competition (economics)|competition]] by suppressing the [[monopoly]] of [[guild]]s. The administration was decentralised and the nobility's power reduced. There were also parallel military reforms led by [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst]], [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau]] and [[Hermann von Boyen]] and educational reforms headed by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]. Gneisenau made it clear that all these reforms were part of a single programme when he stated that Prussia had to put its foundations in "the three-faced primacy of arms, knowledge and the constitution".&lt;ref&gt;Cited after {{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is harder to ascertain when the reforms ended – in the fields of the constitution and internal politics in particular, the year 1819 marked a turning point, with [[Concert of Europe|Restoration]] tendencies gaining the upper hand over constitutional ones. Though the reforms undoubtedly modernised Prussia, their successes were mixed, with results that were against the reformers' original wishes. The agricultural reforms freed some peasants, but the liberalisation of landholding condemned many of them to poverty. The nobility saw its privileges reduced but its overall position reinforced.

==Reasons, aims and principles==

===Prussia in 1807===

====Prussia's position in Europe====
[[File:Preussen-1806.jpg|thumb|Map showing Prussian territory after Tilsit (in orange)]]
In 1803, [[German Mediatisation]] profoundly changed the political and administrative map of Germany. Favourable to mid-ranking states and to Prussia, the reorganisation reinforced French influence. In 1805, the [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalition]] formed in the hope of stopping French domination of Europe from advancing further, but the coalition's armies were defeated at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] in December 1805. Triumphant, [[Napoleon I]] continued working towards dismantling the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. On 12 July 1806, he detached 16 German states from it to form the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] under French influence. On 6 August the same year, [[Francis I of Austria]] was forced to renounce his title of emperor, and the Empire had to be dissolved.

French influence reached as far as the Prussian frontier by the time [[Frederick III of Prussia|Frederick William III of Prussia]] realised the situation. Encouraged by the [[United Kingdom]], Prussia broke off its neutrality (in force since 1795) and repudiated the 1795 [[Peace of Basel]], joined the [[Fourth Coalition]] and entered the war against France.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=438}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prussia mobilised its troops on 9 August 1806 but two months later was defeated at [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|Jena-Auerstedt]]. Prussia was on the verge of collapse, and three days after the defeat Frederick William III issued posters appealing to the inhabitants of his capital Berlin to remain calm.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nordbruch|1996|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten days later, Napoleon entered Berlin.

The war ended on 7 July 1807 with the first Treaty of Tilsit between Napoleon and [[Alexander I of Russia]]. Two days later, Napoleon signed a second Treaty of Tilsit with Prussia, removing half its territory&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Knopper|Mondot|2008|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; and forcing Prussia's king to recognise [[Jérôme Bonaparte]] as sovereign of the newly created [[Kingdom of Westphalia]], to which Napoleon annexed the Prussian territories west of the [[river Elbe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prussia had had 9 million inhabitants in 1805,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Pölitz|1830|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which it lost 4.55 million in the treaty.&lt;ref name="p501"&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=501}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also forced to pay 120 million francs to France in war indemnities&lt;ref name="p501" /&gt; and fund a French occupying force of 150,000 troops.

====Financial situation====
The biting defeat of 1806 was not only the result of poor decisions and Napoleon's military genius, but also a reflection on Prussia's poor internal structures. In the 18th century the Prussian state had been the model of [[enlightened despotism]] for the rest of Germany. To the west and south, there was no single state or alliance that could challenge it. Yet in the era of [[Frederick II of Prussia]] it was a country oriented towards reform, beginning with the abolition of torture in 1740.

[[File:Der König überall2.JPG|thumb|[[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]] inspecting his lands and talking to potato growers.]]
The economic reforms of the second half of the 18th century were based on a [[mercantilism|mercantilist]] logic. They had to allow Prussia a certain degree of [[self-sufficiency]] and give it sufficient surpluses for export. Joseph Rovan emphasises that {{cquote|the state's interest required that its subjects were kept in good health, well nourished, and that agriculture and manufacture made the country independent of foreign countries, all the while allowing it to raise money by exporting surpluses&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=413}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Economic development also had to fund and support the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Reihlen|1988|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prussia's infrastructure was developed in the form of canals, roads and factories. Roads connected its outlying regions to its centre, the [[Oder]], [[Warta]] and [[Noteć]] marshes were reclaimed and farmed&lt;ref name="p411"&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=411}}&lt;/ref&gt; and apple-growing was developed.

However, industry remained very limited, with heavy state-control. Trades were organised into monopolistic guilds and fiscal and customs laws were complex and inefficient. After the defeat of 1806, funding the occupation force and the war indemnities put Prussia's economy under pressure. As in the 18th century, the early 19th century reforms aimed to create budgetary margins, notably in their efforts towards economic development.

====Administrative and legal situation====
Frederick II of Prussia favoured both economic and political reform. His government worked on the first codification of Prussia's laws – the 19,000 paragraph ''Allgemeines Landrecht für die preußischen Staaten'' (literally the ''General legal code for the Prussia states''). Article 22 indicated that all his subjects were equal before the law: {{Cquote|The state's laws unite all its members, without difference of status, rank or sex}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Frederick died in 1786 leaving the code incomplete and was succeeded by [[Frederick William II of Prussia]], who extended the same administrative structure and the same civil servants.

The absolutist system started to re-solidify under the obscurantist influence of [[Johann Christoph von Wöllner]], financial privy councillor to Frederick William II. The reforms stalled, especially in the field of modernising society. The editing of the ''Allgemeines Landrecht'' was completed in 1792, but the [[French Revolution]] led to opposition to it, especially from the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then withdrawn from circulation for revision and did not come back into force until 1794. Its aims included linking the state and middle class society to the law and to civil rights, but at the same time it retained and confirmed the whole structure of the [[Ancien Régime]].&lt;ref name="p411" /&gt; [[Serfdom]], for example, was abolished in Prussia's royal domains but not in the estates of the great landowners east of the [[river Elbe]].&lt;ref name="Nipperdey_33"&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nobility also held onto its position in the army and administration.

In 1797 Frederick William III succeeded his father Frederick William II, but at the time of his accession he found society dominated by the old guard, apart from the ''Allgemeines Landrecht'' promulgated in 1794. His own idea of the state was absolutist and he considered that the state had to be in the hands of the sovereign.&lt;ref name="harvp|Griewank|2003|p=14"&gt;{{harvp|Griewank|2003|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1806, several observers and high-level civil servants such as [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom Stein]] and [[Karl August von Hardenberg]] underlined the fact that the Prussia state needed restructuring. As Minister of Finances and the Economy, Stein put some reforms in place, such as standardising the price of salt (then a state monopoly) and partially abolishing the export-import taxes between the kingdom's territories. In April 1806, he published ''Darstellung der fehlerhaften Organisation des Kabinetts und der Notwendigkeit der Bildung einer Ministerialkonferenz'' (literally ''Exposé on the imperfect organisation of the cabinet and on the necessity of forming a ministerial conference''). In it, he wrote: {{Cquote|There should be a new and improved organisation of state affairs, to the measure of the state's needs born of circumstances. The main aim is to gain more strength and unity across the administration}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Türk|Lemke|Bruch|2006|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Grassi, Josef Mathias - Luise von Mecklenburg-Strelitz.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Queen Louise of Prussia]]]]
Prussia's war against Napoleon revealed the gaps in its state organisation. Pro-war and a strong critic of his sovereign's policies, Stein was dismissed in January 1807 after the defeat by France. However, Frederick William III saw that the Prussian state and Prussian society could only survive if they began to reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wehler|1987|p=401}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the treaty of Tislsit, he recalled Stein as a minister on 10 July 1807 with the backing of Hardenberg and Napoleon, the latter of whom saw in Stein a supporter of France.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Pertz, pp. 449–450.{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queen [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]] also supported Stein's re-appointment&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=451}}&lt;/ref&gt; – indeed, she was more in favour of reform than her husband and was its main initiator. Aided by Stein, Hardenberg and others, she had convinced her husband to mobilise in 1806 and in 1807 she had even met with Napoleon to demand that he review the hard conditions imposed in the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Förster|2004|p=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardenberg wrote the same year: {{cquote|I believe that queen Louise could tell the king what the queen of Navarre, [[Catherine de Foix]], said to her husband [[Jean d'Albret]] – "If we were born, your dear Catherine and my dear Jean, we would not have lost our kingdom"; for she would have listened to men of energy and asked advice, she would have taken them on and acted decisively. What [the king] lacks in personal strength is replaced in this way. An enterprising courage would have replaced a tolerant courage.&lt;ref name="harvp|Griewank|2003|p=14"&gt;{{harvp|Griewank|2003|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Stein set certain conditions for his taking the job, among which was that the cabinets system should be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Pertz, pp. 115–116.{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its place, ministers had to win their right to power by speaking to the king directly. After this condition had been satisfied, Stein took up his role and was thus directly responsible for the civil administration as well as exercising a controlling role over the other areas. Frederick William III still showed little inclination to engage in reforms and hesitated for a long while.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Förster|2004|p=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reformers thus had to expend much effort convincing the king. In this situation, it was within the bureaucracy and the army that the reformers had to fight the hardest against the nobility and the conservative and restorationist forces. The idealist philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]] thus had a great influence on the reformers – Stein and Hardenberg each produced a treatise describing their ideas in 1807.

====''Nassauer Denkschrift''====
[[File:Standbild Heumarkt Köln - Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom Stein.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Karl Heinrich vom Stein]], instigator of the early reforms]]
After his recall, Stein retired to his lands in [[Nassau, Germany|Nassau]]. In 1807, he published the ''Nassauer Denkschrift'', whose main argument was the reform of the administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the reforms in the states of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], Stein's approach was traditionalist and above all anti-Enlightenment, focussing instead on critiquing absolutism. Stein followed English models such as the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 and was sceptical of a centralised and militarised bureaucracy, favouring a decentralised and collegiate administration. With his collaborators, he followed (in his own words) a "policy of defensive modernisation, not with Napoleon but against him".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Stein, the administration should be split up by field and no longer by geographical area.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the administration had to be divided into two branches – the public revenue branch and the top-level state-policy branch (''oberste Staatsbehörde''). One of the main aims of this concept was to rationalise the state financial system to raise the money to meet its war indemnities under the treaty of Tilsit. Rationalising the state finances would allow the state to raise revenue but limit losses due to poor administrative organisation.

Stein was an anti-absolutist and an anti-statist, suspicious of bureaucracy and central government. For him, civil servants were only men paid to carry out their task with "indifference" and "fear of innovation".&lt;ref name="p141"&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Above all, he set out to decentralise and form a collegiate state.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stein thus gave more autonomy to the provinces, [[Districts of Germany|Kreise]] and towns. Thanks to the different posts he had previously held, Stein, realised that he had to harmonise the government of the provinces.&lt;ref name="p141" /&gt; He had recourse to the old corporative constitution, as he had experienced in [[Westphalia]]. The landowner, according to Stein, was the keystone to local self-government – "If the landowner is excluded from all participation in the provincial administration, then the link which links him to the fatherland remains unused".&lt;ref name="p141"/&gt;

However, it was not only functional considerations which played a role for Stein. He felt he first had to educate the people in politics and provincial self-government was one of the most useful things in this area. On landowners' participation in the provincial administration, he wrote&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{cquote|the economy as regards administrative costs is however the least important advantage gained by the landowners' participation in the provincial administration. What is much more important is to stimulate the spirit of the community and of the civic sense, the use of sleeping and poorly led forces and spreading knowledge, the harmony between the spirit of the nation, its views and its needs and those of the national administrations, the re-awakening of the feelings for the fatherland, independence and national honour.}} In his reform projects, Stein tried to reform a political system without losing sight of the Prussian unity shaken by the defeat of 1806.

====''Rigaer Denkschrift''====
[[File:Standbild Heumarkt Köln - Barthold Georg Niebuhr.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr|Niebuhr]] on the Cologne monument (1878)]]
Stein and Hardenberg not only made a mark on later policy but also represented two different approaches to politics, with Hardenberg more steeped in Enlightenment ideas. He took the principles of the French Revolution and the suggestions created by Napoleon's practical policy on board more deeply than Stein.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardenberg was a [[statism|statist]] who aspired to reinforce the state through a dense and centralised administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kitchen|2006|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, these differences only represented a certain change of tendency among the reformers. The initiatives put in place were very much things of their own time, despite the latter umbrella concept of the 'Stein-Hardenberg reforms'.

The ''Rigaer Denkschrift'' was published the same year as Stein's work and presented on 12 September 1807. It bore the title 'On the reorganisation of the Prussian state'. Previously living in [[Riga]], Hardenberg had been summoned in July by the king of Prussia under pressure from Napoleon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardenberg developed ideas on the overall organisation of the Prussian state that were different from those of his fellow reformers. The main editors of the ''Rigaer Denkschrift'' were [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]], an expert financier, [[Karl vom Stein zum Altenstein]], a future minister of Finances&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Walther|1993|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Heinrich Theodor von Schön]]. These three men concluded that the Revolution had given France a new impetus: "All the sleeping forces were re-awakened, the misery and weakness, the old prejudices and the shortcomings were destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;''Rigaer Denkschrift'' in {{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|pp=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in their view, Prussia had to follow France's example: {{Cquote|The folly of thinking that one can access the revolution in the safest way, remaining attached to the [[ancien regime]] and strictly following the principles for which it argues has only stimulated the revolution and made it continually grow larger. These principles' power is so great – they are so generally recognised and accepted, that the state that does not accept them must expect to be ruined or to be forced to accept them ; even the rapacity of Napoleon and his most-favoured aides are submitted to this power, and will remain so against their will. One cannot deny that, despite the iron despotism with which he governs, he nevertheless follows these principles widely in their essential features ; at least he is forced to make a show of obeying them.&lt;ref name="Rigaer_88"&gt;''Rigaer Denkschrift'' in {{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The authors thus favoured a revolution "im guten Sinn" or "in the right sense",&lt;ref name="Rigaer_88"/&gt; which historians later described as "revolution from above". Sovereigns and their ministers thus put in place reforms to gain all the advantages of a revolution without any of the disadvantages, such as losing their power or suffering from setbacks or outbreaks of violence.

As in Stein's Denkschrift, the ''Rigaer Denkschrift'' favours reviving national spirit to work with the nation and the administration. Hardenberg also sought to define society's three classes – the nobility, the middle class and the peasants. For him, the peasants took part in "the most numerous and most important but nevertheless the most neglected and belittled class in the state" and added that "the peasant class has to become the main object of our attention".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardenberg also sought to underline the principal of merit which he felt had to rule in society, by affirming "no task in the state, without exception, is for this or that class but is open to merit and to skill and to the ability of all classes".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overview of the reforms===
Within fourteen months of his appointment, Stein put in place or prepared the most important reforms. The major financial crisis caused by the requirements of Tilsit forced Stein into a radical austerity policy, harnessing the state's machinery to raise the required indemnities. The success of the reforms begun by Stein was the result of a discussion already going on within the upper bureaucracy and Stein's role in putting them in place was variable – he was almost never, for example, involved in questions of detail. Many of the reforms were drafted by others among his collaborators, such as [[Heinrich Theodor von Schön]] in the case of the October decree.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Klein|1965|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Stein was responsible for presenting the reforms to the king and to other forces opposed to them, such as the nobility.

[[File:2006-08-07 Rathaus Schoeneberg Gedenkrelief vom Stein.jpg|thumb|left|Plaque celebrating Stein and the ''Städteordnung'' in Berlin (1913)]]
During Stein's short period of office, decisive laws were promulgated, even if the organizational law on state administration was not published until 1808 (i.e. after Stein's fall). It was during Stein's time in office that the edict of October 1807 and the cities' organizational reforms (''Städteordnung'') of 1808 were put into effect. After a short term of office by [[Karl vom Stein zum Altenstein]], Hardenberg regained control of policy. From 1810, he bore the title of ''[[Staatskanzler]]'',&lt;ref name="harvp|Büsch|1992|p=287"&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; retaining it until 1822. Thanks to him, land reform was completed via the Edicts of Regulation (''Regulierungsedikten'') of 1811 and 1816 as well as the ''Ablöseordnung'' (literally the ''redemption decree'') of 1821. He also pushed through the reforms of trades such as the edict on professional tax of 2 November 1810 and the law on policing trades (''Gewerbepolizeigesetz'') of 1811. In 1818 he reformed the customs laws, abolishing internal taxes. As for social reform, the edict of emancipation was promulgated in 1812 for Jewish citizens. Despite the different initial situations and aims pursued, similar reforms were carried out in the states of the Confederation of the Rhine, except for the military and educational reforms. The Restoration tendencies put a stop to the reformist policy in Prussia around 1819 or 1820.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Main reform fields===
[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|thumb|upright|In the field of political economy, the reformers were strongly influenced by [[Adam Smith]].]]
The reforms which were to be put in place were essentially a synthesis between historic and progressive concepts. Their aim was to replace the absolutist state structures which had become outdated. The state would have to offer its citizens the possibility of becoming involved in public affairs on the basis of personal freedom and equality before the law. The government's main policy aim was to make it possible to liberate Prussian territory from French occupation and return the kingdom to great-power status through modernising domestic policy.&lt;ref name="p453"&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prussian subject had to become an active citizen of the state thanks to the introduction of self-government to the provinces, districts (''kreise'') and towns. National sentiment had to be awakened as Stein foresaw in his Nassau work,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; but a citizen's duties were in some ways more important than his or her rights. Moreover, Stein's concept of self-government rested on a class-based society. A compromise between corporative aspects and a modern representative system was put in place. The old divisions into the [[three estates]] of nobility, clergy and [[bourgeoisie]] were replaced by divisions into nobility, bourgeoisie and peasants. The right to vote also had to be expanded, particularly to free peasants, which would be one of the bases for the freeing of the peasants in 1807.

The new organisation of power in the countryside and reform of industry were factors in the liberalisation of the Prussian economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, the Prussian reforms went much further than those in the states of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] and were much more successful. The 1806 financial crisis, intensified by the indemnities, the occupation costs and other war costs, gave the necessary impetus for these changes – in all, Prussia had to pay France 120 million francs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Leo|1845|p=491}}&lt;/ref&gt; The freeing of the peasants, the industrial reforms and the other measures removed economic barriers and imposed free competition. The Prussian reforms relied on the economic liberalism of [[Adam Smith]] (as propounded by [[Heinrich Theodor von Schön]] and [[Christian Jakob Kraus]]) more heavily than the south German reformers. The Prussian reformers did not actively seek to encourage Prussian industry, which was then under-developed, but to remedy the crisis in the agricultural economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|pp=109–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State and administration==
The reformers' top priority was to reorganise the administration and the state. Before 1806, there was not really a single Prussian state, but a multiplicity of states and provinces, mostly only held together by the single person of the king himself. There was no unified administration – instead there were the two parallel structures of decentralised administrations (each responsible for all portfolios within a single given territory) and a centralised administration (responsible for a single portfolio across the whole of Prussia). This double structure made any coordinated action difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government also had no overview of Prussia's economic situation and its government ministers had little clout faced with the king's cabinet, where they had less power than the king's private political councillors.

===Bureaucracy and leadership===
The start of the Stein era saw the unification of the Prussian state, with the old system of cabinets being abolished. A ministry of state (''Staatsministerium'') was introduced on 16 December 1808 in place of a top-level administration poorly defined as the ''Generaldirektorium''. This reform was completed in 1810. Now the administration was ruled according to the principle of portfolios. The ''Staatsministerium'' included five major ministries – minister of the interior, minister for foreign affairs, minister for finances, minister for justice and minister of war, all responsible to the king alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; These modifications could not take full effect, however, until a more effective statist model of leadership was created. This was done by replacing Prussian absolutism with a double domination of king and bureaucracy, in which the ministers had an important role, reducing the king's influence and meaning he could now only reign through his ministers' actions. In Stein's era, the ''Staatsministerium'' was organised in a collegiate way without a prime minister – that post was set up under Hardenberg, who received the title of ''Staatskanzler'' or State Chancellor in June 1810&lt;ref name="harvp|Büsch|1992|p=287"/&gt; along with control over the ministers' relations with the king.

The role of the head of state was also considerably modified. From 1808, Prussia was divided into districts. The different governments of these districts were set up according to the principle of portfolios, as with the national ministers of state. Each region was given an ''[[Oberpräsident]]'' for the first time, directly subordinate to the national ministers and with the role of stimulating public affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their rôle, which even went as far as putting up sanitary cordons in the event of an epidemic, was similar to that of French [[prefect (France)|prefect]]s – that is, to represent regional interests to the central government. The post was abolished in 1810 but revived in 1815 to play an important part in political life. It was in this context that justice and administration were separated once and for all.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Botzenhart|1985|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the establishment of administrative acts, the people concerned thus had a right of appeal. Nevertheless, there was no judicial control on the administration. Aiming to reduce any influence on the administration, this was reinforced by different administrative acts. The organisation that the reformers put in place served as a model for other German states and to major businesses.

===National representation===
[[File:Friedrich-August-Ludwig-von-der-Marwitz-1777-1837.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Friedrich August von der Marwitz]] was one of the representatives of the aristocratic opposition.]]
In parallel to the ''Staatsministerium'', Stein planned the creation of a ''Staatsrat'' or [[Privy Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he had had no opportunity to set up a correctly functioning one by 1808 and it was Hardenberg who set it up in 1810. The text of the relevant law stated: {{Cquote|We ordain a Council of State and by edict give our orders and our decisions on one side in this upper chamber and on the other side in our cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The members of the Council of State had to be current ministers or former ministers, high-level civil servants, princes of the royal house or figures nominated by the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|pp=150–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; A commission was also formed to function as a kind of parliament, with major legislative rights. As a bastion of the bureaucracy, the Council of State had to prevent any return to absolutism or any moves to reinforce the interests of the [[Ancien Régime]]. The Council of State also had to [[subrogation|subroge]] all laws and administrative and constitutional procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same way as the towns' self-government, Hardenberg foresaw the establishment of a national representative body made up of [[Imperial State|corporative]] and representative elements. The first assembly of notable figures was held in 1811 and the second in 1812. These were made up of a corporative base of 18 aristocratic landowners, 12 urban property owners and nine representatives from among the peasants. This corporative composition was based partly on the traditional conception of society and partly on practical and fiscal considerations&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=461}}&lt;/ref&gt; – in order to be able to pay its war indemnities to France, the Prussian state had to have massive recourse to credit contracts issued by the aristocrats and to gain credit in foreign countries the different states had to offer themselves as guarantors.

After the summoning of the provisional assemblies, it quickly became clear that their deputies' first priority was not the state's interests but more defending their own classes' interests. The nobility saw the reforms as trying to reduce their privileges and so blocked them in the assemblies, led by figures such as [[Friedrich August von der Marwitz]] and Friedrich Ludwig Karl Fink von Finkenstein. Their resistance went so far that the cabinet even resorted to imprisoning them at [[Spandau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bussiek|2002|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Reinhart Koselleck]] has argued that the establishment of a corporative national representative body prevented all later reforms. At the end of the reforming period, the districts and the provincial representative bodies (such as the ''Provinziallandtage'') remained based on corporative principles. Prussia was prevented from forming a true representative national body, with considerable consequences on the internal development of Prussia and the [[German Confederation]]. Thus, while the states of the Confederation of the Rhine located in southern Germany became constitutional states, Prussia remained without a parliament until 1848.&lt;ref name="harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=113"&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reform of the towns===
[[File:Stadtverordnete1808.jpg|thumb|upright|Religious service for the first Prussian municipal councillors in 1808 in Berlin]]
Prior to the reforms the Prussian towns east of the [[river Elbe]] were under the state's direct control, with any surviving instances of self-government retaining their names and forms but none of their power. Stein's reform of the towns used this former tradition of self-government.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; All rights specific to a certain city were abolished and all the cities put under the same structures and rule – this even came to be the case for their courts and police. Self-government was at the centre of the town reforms of 1808, with the towns now no longer subject to the state and their citizens given a duty to participate in the towns' political life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=456}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the strongest indication of Stein's rejection of a centralised bureaucracy – self-government had to awaken its citizens' interest in public affairs in order to benefit the whole Prussian state.

The ''Städteordnung'' (Municipal Ordinance) of 1808 defined a citizen (or at least a citizen in the sense of the inhabitant of a town or city) as "a citizen or member of an urban community which possesses the right of citizenship in a town".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; The municipal councillors were representatives of the town and not of an order or [[Three Estates|estate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; These councillors could be elected by all landowning citizens with a taxable revenue of at least 15 [[Thaler|taler]]. A councillor's main task was to participate in the election of a municipal council or ''Magistrat'', headed by a mayor. The election of the mayor and the members of the council had to be ratified by the central government. Different officials were put in place to carry out administrative portfolios. The council managed the municipal budget and the town also managed its own police.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite some democratic elements, the town administrations retained large corporative elements – the groups were differentiated according to their estates and only citizens had full rights. Only landowners and industrial property-owners had a right to citizenship, though it was in principle also open to other people, such as ''Eximierten'' (bourgeois people, mostly those in state service) or ''Schutzverwandten'' (members of the lower classes without full citizenship rights). The costs linked to a citizen's [[octroi]] dissuaded many people. It was only the new reform of 1831 which replaced the 1808 assemblies of ''Bürger'' (citizens) with assemblies of inhabitants. Until the [[Vormärz]], self-government in the towns was in the hands of artisans and established businessmen. In the cities and large towns, the citizens with full rights and their families represented around a third of the total population. Resistance by the nobility prevented these reforms from also being set up in the countryside.&lt;ref name="harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=113"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|pp=38–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reforms were a step towards modern civic self-government.

===Customs and tax reforms===
Tax reform was a central problem for the reformers, notably due to the war indemnities imposed by Napoleon, and these difficulties marked Hardenberg's early reforms. He managed to avoid state bankruptcy&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Müller-Osten|2007|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; and inflation by increasing taxes or selling off lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; These severe financial problems led to a wholesale fiscal reform. Taxes were standardised right across Prussia, principally by replacing the wide variety of minor taxes with main taxes. The reformers also tried to introduce equal taxation for all citizens, thus bringing them into conflict with aristocratic privileges. On 27 October 1810, the king proclaimed in his ''Finanzedikt'':{{cquote|We find we need to ask all our faithful subjects to pay increased taxes, mainly in the taxes on consumer goods and deluxe objects, though these will be simplified and charged on fewer articles, associated with the raising of complementary taxes and [[excise]]s all as heavier taxes. These taxes will be borne in a proportional manner by all the classes of the nation and will be reduced as soon as the unfortunate need disappears.{{#tag:ref|"Wir sehen Uns genöthigt, von Unsern getreuen Unterthanen die Entrichtung erhöhter Abgaben, hauptsächlich von der Konsumtion und von Gegenständen des Luxus zu fordern, die aber vereinfacht, auf weniger Artikel zurückgebracht, mit Abstellung der Nachschüsse und der Thoraccisen, so wie mehrerer einzelner lästigen Abgaben, verknüpft und von allen Klassen der Nation verhältnißmäßig gleich getragen, und gemindert werden sollen, sobald das damit zu bestreitende Bedürfniß aufhören wird."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}}}
Excises were raised the following year on appeals.&lt;ref name="p118"&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1819, excise (originally only raised by the towns) was suppressed and replaced with a tax on the consumption of beer, wine, gin and tobacco.&lt;ref name="p28"&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the industrial sphere, several taxes were replaced with a progressively spread-out professional tax. Other innovations were an income tax and a tax on wealth based on a tax evaluation carried out by the taxpayer. 1820 saw protests against a tax on classes, the tax being defined by the taxpayer's position in society.&lt;ref name="p28" /&gt; This tax on classes was an intermediate form between [[Tax per head|poll tax]] and income tax. The towns had the possibility of retaining the tax on cattle and cereal crops. The results for fiscal policy remain controversial. The nobility was not affected by the taxes as the reformers had originally planned, so much so that they did not managed to put in place a 'foncier' tax also including the nobility. The poorest suffered most as a result of these measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zollvereinpreussen.jpeg|thumb|One of the forerunners of the ''Zollverein'' was [[Wilhelm Anton von Klewitz]], Prussian Minister of Finances.]]
It was only after the end of the Napoleonic Wars and after the territorial reorganisation of Europe at the [[Congress of Vienna]] that Prussia's customs duties were reformed. At the Congress Prussia regained its western territories, leading to economic competition between the industrialised part of these territories such as the [[Rhine Province]], the [[Province of Westphalia]] and the territories in Saxony on the one hand and the essentially agricultural territories to the east of the Elbe on the other. Customs policy was also very disparate.&lt;ref name="p118" /&gt; Thus, in 1817, there were 57 customs tariffs on 3,000 goods passing from the historic western territories to the Prussian heartland, with the taxes in the heartland not yet having spread to the formerly French-dominated western provinces.

This was one of the factors that made customs reform vital. That reform occurred on 26 May 1818, with the establishment of a compromise between the interest of the major landowners practicing free-exchange and those of the still-weak industrial economy asking for [[protectionism|protectionist]] custom duties. They therefore only took on what would now be called a tax for protecting internal markets from foreign competition and customs duties for haulage were lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mercantile policy instituted by Frederick II thus came to an end. Export bans were lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Reihlen|1988|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The customs laws and duties put in place by the reformers proved so simple and effective over time that they served as a model for taxation in other German states for around fifty years and that their basic principles remained in place under the [[German Empire]]. The Prussian customs policy was one of the important factors in the creation of the [[Zollverein|Deutscher Zollverein]] in the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fischer|1972|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wehler|1987|pp=442–445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and politics==

===Agricultural reforms===
Agriculture was reformed across Europe at this time, though in different ways and in different phases. The usefulness of existing agricultural methods came into doubt and so the [[Ancien Régime]]'s and [[Holy Roman Empire]]'s agricultural structures were abolished. Peasants were freed and became landowners; and services and [[corvée]]s were abolished. Private landownership also led to the breakdown of [[common land]]s – that is, to the usage of woods and meadows 'in common'. These communal lands were mostly given to lords in return for lands acquired by the peasants. Some meadow{{what|date=May 2018}} reforms had already taken place in some parts of Prussia before 1806, such as the freeing of the peasants on royal lands in the 18th century, though this freeing only fully came into force in 1807.

The landowning nobility successfully managed to oppose similar changes. The government had to confront aristocratic resistance even to the pre-1806 reforms, which became considerable. The ''Gesindeordnung'' of 1810 was certainly notable progress for servants compared to that proposed in the ''Allgemeines Landrecht'', but still remained conservative and favourable to the nobility. The nobility's opposition to this also led to several privileges being saved from abolition. The rights of the police and the courts were controlled more strongly by the state, but not totally abolished like religious and scholarly patrongage, hunting rights and fiscal privileges. Unlike the reforms in the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]], the nobles were not asked to justify their rank. The reformers made compromises, but the nobility were unable to block the major changes brought by the reforms' central points.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|pp=40–43, 47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wehler|1987|p=406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Edict of October 1807====
[[File:Oktoberedikt.jpg|thumb|upright|Frontispiece of the October 1807 edict.]]
The freeing of the peasants marked the start of the Prussian reforms. The kingdom's modernisation began by modernising its base, that is, its peasants and its agriculture. At the start of the 19th century, 80% of the German population lived in the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Botzenhart|1985|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The edict of 9 October 1807, one of the central reforms, liberated the peasants and was signed only five days after Stein's appointment on von Schön's suggestion. The October edict began the process of abolishing [[serfdom]] and its hereditary character. The first peasants to be freed were those working on the domains in the ''Reichsritter'' and on 11 November 1810 at the latest, all the Prussian serfs were declared free:&lt;ref name="p51"&gt;{{harvp|Botzenhart|1985|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Cquote|On [[St Martin's Day]] 1810 all servitude ended throughout our states. After St Martin's Day 1810, there would be nothing but free people as was already the case over our domains in our provinces[...].{{#tag:ref|"Mit dem Martini-Tage Eintausend Achthundert und Zehn (1810.) hört alle Guts-Unterthänigkeit in Unsern sämmtlichen Staaten auf. Nach dem Martini-Tage 1810. giebt es nur freie Leute, so wie solches auf den Domainen in allen Unsern Provinzen schon der Fall ist [...]"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=332}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}}} However, though serfdom was abolished, [[corvée]]s were not – the October edict said nothing on the latter subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The October edict authorised all Prussian citizens to acquire property and choose their profession, including the nobles, who until then could not take on jobs reserved for the bourgeoisie: {{Cquote|Any nobleman is authorised, without prejudice to its estate, to take up a bourgeois job ; and any bourgeois or peasant is authorised to join the bourgeoisie in the case of the peasant or the peasantry in the case of the bourgeois.{{#tag:ref|"Jeder Edelmann ist, ohne allen Nachtheil seines Standes, befugt, bürgerliche Gewerbe zu treiben; und jeder Bürger oder Bauer ist berechtigt, aus dem Bauer- in den Bürger und aus dem Bürger- in den Bauerstand zu treten"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}}} The principle of "[[dérogeance]]" disappeared.

The peasants were allowed to travel freely and set up home in the towns and no longer had to buy their freedom or pay for its with domestic service. The peasants no longer had to ask their lord's permission to marry – this freedom in marriage led to a rising birth rate and population in the countryside. The freeing of the peasants, however, was also to their disadvantage – lordly domains were liberalised and major landowners were allowed to buy peasants' farms (the latter practice having been illegal previously). The lords no longer had an obligation to provide housing for any of their former serfs who became invalids or too old to work. This all led to the formation of an economic class made up of bourgeois and noble entrepreneurs who opposed the bourgeoisie.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Edict of regulation (1811)====
After the reformers freed the peasants, they were faced with other problems, such as the abolition of corvées and the establishment of properties. According to the ''Allgemeines Landrecht'', these problems could only be solved by compensating the financiers. The need to legally put in place a "revolution from above" slowed down the reforms.

The edict of regulation of 1811 solved the problem by making all peasants the owners of the farms they farmed. In place of buying back these lands (which was financially impossible), the peasants were obliged to compensate their former lords by handing over between a third and a half of the farmed lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=337}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid splitting up the lands and leaving areas that were too small to viably farm, in 1816 the buy-back of these lands was limited to major landowners. The smaller ones remained excluded from [[allodial title]].&lt;ref name="p117f"&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other duties linked to serfdom, such as that to provide domestic service and the payment of authorisation taxes on getting married, were abolished without compensation. As for corvées and services in kind, the peasants had to buy back from their lords for 25% of their value.

[[File:Baranowen-1850.jpg|thumb|Estate of Baranowen]]
The practical compensations in Prussia were without doubt{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} advantageous compared to the reforms put in place in the states of the Confederation of the Rhine. In effect, they allowed the process of reform to be accelerated. Nevertheless, the 12,000 lordly estates in Prussia saw their area increase to reach around 1.5 million Morgen&lt;ref name="p118f"&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; (around 38,000 hectares), mostly made up of common lands, of which only 14% returned to the peasants, with the rest going to the lords. Many of the minor peasants thus lost their means of subsistence and most could only sell their indebted lands to their lords and become agricultural workers.&lt;ref name="p94"&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[set-aside|jachère]] lands were made farmable, but their cultivation remained questionable due to their poor soil quality. The measures put in place by the reformers did have some financial success, however, with Prussia's cultivated land rising from 7.3 to 12.46 million hectares in 1848&lt;ref name="p94" /&gt; and production raised by 40%.&lt;ref name="p117f" /&gt;

In the territories east of the Elbe, the agricultural reforms had major social consequences. Due to the growth of lordly estates,&lt;ref name="p118f" /&gt; the number of lordly families rose greatly, right up until the second half of the 19th century. The number of exploited lands remained the same. A very important lower social class was also created. According to region and the rights in force, the number of agricultural day workers and servants rose 2.5 times. The number of minor landowners, known as ''Kätner'' after their homes (known as ''Kotten''), tripled or even quadrupled. Many of them were dependent on another job. Ernst Rudolf Huber, professor of public law, judged that the agricultural reforms were {{Cquote|one of the tragic ironies of German constitutional history. Through it was shown the internal contradiction of the bourgeois liberalism which created the liberty of the individual and his property and at the same time – due to its own law of the liberty of property – unleashed the accumulation of power in the hands of some people.&lt;ref name="harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=119"&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Reform of industry and its results===
[[File:Schneider wappen.jpg|thumb|upright|Arms of the tailors' guild – like the other guilds, it lost its influence due to the ''Gewerbefreiheit''.]]
The reformers aspired to free individual forces in the industrial sphere just as in the agricultural one, in their devotion to the theories of Adam Smith. To free these forces, they had to get rid of guilds and an economic policy based on mercantilism. To encourage free competition also meant the suppression of all limitations on competition.

It was in this context that the freedom of industry (''Gewerbefreiheit'') was introduced in 1810–1811.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt; To set up an industry, one had to acquire a licence, but even so there were exceptions, such as doctors, pharmacists and hotelliers. The guilds lost their monopoly role and their economic privileges. They were not abolished, but membership of them was now voluntary, not compulsory as it had been in the past. State control over the economy also disappeared, to give way to a free choice of profession and free competition. The reform of industry unlocked the economy and gave it a new impetus. There was no longer any legal difference in the industrial sphere between the town and the countryside. Only mining remained as an exception until the 1860s.

Originally planned to encourage rural industry, the freedom of industry became the central condition for Prussian economic renewal on an industrial base. As had happened with the nobility, the citizens of the towns arose unsuccessfully opposed the reforms. Their immediate results were contradictory—early on, non-guild competition was weak, but after a period of adaptation the number of non-guild artisans rose significantly. However, in the countryside, the burdens of the artisans and other industries rose considerably. This rise in the number of artisans was not accompanied by a similar growth in the rest of the population.&lt;ref name="harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=119"&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of master-craftsmen rose too, but master-craftsmen remained poor due to the strong competition. During the [[Vormärz]], tailors, cobblers, carpenters and weavers were the main over-subscribed trades. The rise in the lower classes in the countryside accentuated the 'social question and would be one of the causes of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 Revolution]].&lt;ref name="harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=119"&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wehler|1987|pp=429–432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish emancipation===
{{further|Jewish emancipation|Disabilities (Jewish)}}
By the Edict of Emancipation of 11 March 1812, Jews [[Jewish emancipation|gained the same rights and duties]] as other citizens:
{{Cquote|We, Frederick William, King of Prussia by the Grace of God, etc. etc., having decided to establish a new constitution conforming to the public good of Jewish believers living in [[Royal we|our]] Kingdom, proclaim all the former laws and prescriptions not confirmed in this present Edict to be abrogated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} To gain civil rights, all Jews had to declare themselves to the police within six months of the promulgation of the edict and choose a definitive name.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Edict was the result of a long reflection since 1781, begun by [[Christian Wilhelm von Dohm]], pursued by [[David Friedländer]] in a thesis to Frederick William II in 1787 (Friedländer approved the Edict of 1812&lt;ref&gt;Jean Mondot, "L'émancipation des Juifs en Allemagne entre 1789 et 1815", in {{harvp|Knopper|Mondot|2008|p=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Humboldt's influence allowed for the so-called "[[Jewish question]]" to be re-examined.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Mondot, "L'émancipation des Juifs en Allemagne entre 1789 et 1815", in {{harvp|Knopper|Mondot|2008|p=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 8 of the Edict allowed Jews to own land and take up municipal and university posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jews were free to practise their religion and their traditions were protected. Nevertheless, unlike the reforms in the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]], the Edict of Emancipation in Prussia [[Disabilities (Jewish)|did have some limitations]] – Jews could not become army officers or have any government or legal role, but were still required to do military service.

Even if some traditionalists opposed the Edict of Emancipation&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=460}}&lt;/ref&gt;, it proved a major step towards Jewish emancipation in the [[German states]] during the 19th century. The judicial situation in Prussia was significantly better than that in most of southern and eastern Germany, making it an attractive destination for Jewish immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wehler|1987|p=408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other areas==

===Education===

====New organisation====
[[File:Reiterstandbild Wilhelm III Sockelfig Koeln2007 Humboldt.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] wished to reform Prussia's school and university system.]]
For the reformers, the reform of the [[Prussian education system]] (''Bildung'') was a key reform. All the other reforms relied on creating a new type of citizen who had to be capable of proving themselves responsible and the reformers were convinced that the nation had to be educated and made to grow up. Unlike the state reforms, which still contained corporative elements, the ''Bildungsreform'' was conceived outside all class structures. [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] was the main figure behind the educational reform. From 1808, he was in charge of the department of religion and education within the ministry of the interior. Like Stein, Humboldt was only in his post for a short time, but was able to put in place the main elements of his reforms.

Humboldt developed his ideas in July 1809 in his treatise ''Über die mit dem Königsberger Schulwesen vorzunehmende Reformen'' (''On reforms to execute with the teaching in Königsberg''). In place of a wide variety of religious, private, municipal and corporative educational institutions, he suggested setting up a school system divided into ''Volksschule'' (people's schools), ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]s'' and universities. Humboldt defined the characteristics of each stage in education. Elementary teaching "truly only need be occupied with language, numbers and measures, and remain linked to the mother tongue being given that nature is indifferent in its design".{{#tag:ref|"Er hat es also eigentlich nur mit Sprach-, Zahl- und Mass-Verhältnissen zu thun, und bleibt, da ihm die Art des Bezeichneten gleichgültig ist, bei der Muttersprache stehen."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} For the second stage, that of being taught in school, Humboldt wrote "The aim of being taught in school is to exercise [a pupil's] ability and to acquire knowledge without which scientific understanding and ability are impossible.{{#tag:ref|"Der Zweck des Schulunterrichts ist die Uebung der Fähigkeit, und die Erwerbung der Kenntnisse, ohne welche wissenschaftliche Einsicht und Kunstfertigkeit unmöglich ist."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} Finally, he stated that university had to train a student in research and allow him to understanding "the unity of science".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=365}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1812, a university entry had to obtain the ''[[Abitur]]''. The state controlled all the schools, but even so it strictly imposed compulsory education and controlled exams. To enter the civil service, performance criteria were set up. Education and performance replaced social origin.

====New humanism====
[[File:Wilhelm von Humboldt Denkmal - Humboldt Universität zu Berlin.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Statue of Humboldt in front of the [[Humboldt University]] in Berlin (1882)]]
Wilhelm von Humboldt backed a new [[humanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=363}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the utilitarian teaching of the Enlightenment, which wished to transmit useful knowledge for practical life, Humboldt desired a general formation of man. From then students had to study antiquity and ancient languages to develop themselves intellectually.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=368}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only would they acquire this humanistic knowledge, they would also acquire other knowledge necessary for other jobs. The state would not seek to form citizens at all costs to serve it, but it did not entirely let go of that aim:
{{Cquote|Each [student] who does not give evidence of becoming a good artisan, businessman, soldier, politician is still a man and a good citizen, honest, clear according to his rank without taking account of his own job. Give him the necessary training and he will acquire the particular capacity for his job very easily and always hold onto liberty, as is the case so often in life, going from one to the other.{{#tag:ref|"Jeder ist offenbar nur dann ein guter Handwerker, Kaufmann, Soldat und Geschäftsmann, wenn er an sich und ohne Hinsicht auf seinen besonderen Beruf ein guter, anständiger, seinem Stande nach aufgeklärter Mensch und Bürger ist. Gibt ihm der Schulunterricht, was hierzu erforderlich ist, so erwirbt er die besondere Fähigkeit seines Berufs nachher sehr leicht und behält immer die Freiheit, wie im Leben so oft geschieht, von einem zum anderen überzugehen"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Giesecke|1991|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}}} Unlike Humboldt, for whom the individual was at the centre of the educational process, the republican [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] rather leaned towards national education to educate the whole people and thus to affirm the nation in the face of Napoleonic domination.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In paying professors better and improving their training, the quality of teaching in the ''Volksschule''s was improved. The newly founded ''gymnasia'' offered a humanist education to ready pupils for university studies. In parallel ''Realschule''s were set up&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=661}}&lt;/ref&gt; to train men in manual trades. Some schools for officer cadets were allowed to remain. Despite stricter state influence and control, the religious authorities retained their role in inspecting schools.

====Universities====
[[File:Berlin Universitaet um 1850.jpg|thumb|Berlin University around 1850.]]
In Humboldt's thinking, university represented the crowning glory of intellectual education and the expression of the ideal of freedom between teaching and research held an important place in it. German universities of the time were mostly mediocre.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=382}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Humboldt, "the state must treat its universities neither as gymnasia nor as specialist schools and must not serve its Academy as a technical or scientific deputation. Together, they must [...] demand nothing of them which does not give it profit immediately and simply".{{#tag:ref|"Der Staat muss seine Universittendäten weder als Gymnasien noch als Specialschulen behandeln, und sich seiner Akademie nicht als technischen oder wissenschaftlichen Deputation bedienen. Er muss im Ganzen [...] von ihnen nichts fordern, was sich unmittelbar und geradezu auf ihn bezieht."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

Students, in his view, had to learn to think autonomously and work in a scientific way by taking part in research. The foundation of [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin University]] served as a model. It was opened in 1810 and the great men of the era taught there – [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], the physician [[Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland]], the historian [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]] and the jurist [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the educational reforms' results were different from what Humboldt had expected. Putting in place his ideal of [[philology|philological]] education excluded the lower classes of society and allied the educational system to the restorationist tendencies. The major cost of education rendered the reforms in this area ineffective. The reformers had hoped that people would rise through the social scale thanks to education, but this did not happen so well as they had hoped.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|pp=120–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military===
[[File:Berlin Scharnhorst memorial.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Statue of [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]] in Berlin (1822)]]
[[File:Reorganisation.jpg|thumb|Commission for military reorganisation at [[Königsberg]] in 1807. The two men in the foreground are [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau|Gneisenau]] and [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]], with the seated person in civilian dress is [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom Stein|Stein]].]]
Unlike the reforms in the states of the Confederation of the Rhine, the Prussian policy was aimed against French supremacy right from the start. Also, the Prussian military reforms were much more profound than those in the south German states. They were instigated by a group of officers which had formed after the defeats of 1806 and notably included [[Gerhard Johann David von Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]], [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau|Gneisenau]], [[Hermann von Boyen|Boyen]], [[Karl von Grolman|Grolman]] and [[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitz]].&lt;ref name="p28"/&gt;

Chief of staff since 1806, Scharnhorst became head of the military reorganisation commission set up by Frederick William III in July 1807. For him, every citizen was a born defender of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Abenheim|1987|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; His main aim was to drive out the French occupiers. In close contact with Stein, Scharnhorst managed to convince the king that the military needed reform. Like the civil administration, the military organisation was simplified, via the creation of a Prussian ministry of war and of an army staff on 25 December 1808.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Millotat|2000|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scharnhorst was at the head of the new ministry and he aimed his reforms at removing the obstacles between army and society and at making the army ground itself in the citizens' patriotism.

====Military service====
[[File:Sommerschenburg Gneisenau.jpg|thumb|left|Memorial to Gneisenau in Sommersdorf-Sommerschenburg (1835)]]
The experiences of 1806 showed that the old organisation of the Prussian army was no longer a match for the might of the French army. Compared to the French defensive tactics, Prussian tactics were too immobile. Its officers treated their soldiers as objects and punished them severely&lt;ref name="p453" /&gt; – one of the most severe punishments, the ''Spießrutenlaufen'', consisted of making a soldier pass between two ranks of men and be beaten by them. The French instead had compulsory military service and the Prussian army's adoption of it was the centre of Prussia's military reforms.

[[File:Gneisenaustatue.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Statue of Gneisenau in Berlin (1855)]]
Frederick William III hesitated about the military reforms, the officer corps and nobility resisted them and even the bourgeoisie remained sceptical. The start of the [[German campaign of 1813]] was the key factor. On 9 February 1813 a decree replaced the previous conscription system with an obligation to serve by canton ''Kantonpflichtigkeit''),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=392}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this new system had to last for the whole war. Thus it looked to restore the pride and position of the common soldier in adapting army discipline to civil law. The punishments and in particular the 'schlague' (consisting of a soldier being beaten) were abolished. The social differences had to disappear. The Treaty of Tilsit had reduced the Prussian army to 42,000 men, but Scharnhorst put in place the "Krümper system",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lange|1857|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which consisted of training a number of soldiers by making them turn without ever exceeding the numbers authorised by the Treaty. Between 30,000 and 150,000 supplementary men were also trained – the training system changed several times and so it is difficult to work out precise numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Neugebauer|Busch|2006|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compulsory military service was ordered by Frederick William III on 27 May 1814 then fixed by a military law on 3 September the same year:{{Cquote|Every man of 20 years is obliged to defend the fatherland. To execute this general obligation, particularly in time of peace, in such manner that the progress of science and industry will not be disturbed, the following exclusion must be applied in taking into account the terms of service and the duration of service.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=393}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Other====
The officer corps was also reformed and several officers dismissed.&lt;ref name="rovan459"&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=459}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nobility's privilege was abolished and a career as an officer was opened up to the bourgeois. The aristocrats disliked this and protested, as with [[Hans David Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg|Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg]]. In practice a system of co-opting of officers was put in place which gave generally favoured nobles, even if there remained some (albeit minor) bourgeois influence. Starting with the regiment of chasseurs on campaign, chasseur and protection units were set up.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gumtau|1837|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was [[Hans David Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg|Yorck von Wartenburg]] who from June 1808 occupied on their training.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Neugebauer|Busch|2006|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the officer corps, it was now the terms of service not the number of years served which determined promotion. The Prussian Academy of War also provided better officer training than before – dissolved after the defeat at Jena, it had been refounded in 1810 by Scharnhorst.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Millotat|2000|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1813–1814&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Braeuner|1863|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the line infantry troops, we also see the [[Landwehr]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=397}}&lt;/ref&gt; which served as reserve troops to defend Prussia itself. It was independent in organisation and had its own units and its own officers. In the ''Kreise'' (districts), commissions organised troops in which the bourgeois could become officers. The reformers' idea of unifying the people and the army seems to have succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|pp=50–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volunteer chasseur detachments (''freiwillige Jägerdetachements'') were also formed as reinforcements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Neugebauer|Busch|2006|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main leaders==
[[File:Reiterstandbild Wilhelm III Sockelfig Koeln2007vonSchon.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Theodor von Schön]]]]
The reforms are sometimes named after their leaders Stein and Hardenberg, but they were also the fruit of a collaboration between experts, each with his own speciality. One of these experts was [[Heinrich Theodor von Schön]] – born in 1773, he had studied law at Königsberg university to follow a career in political sciences. In 1793 he entered Prussian service.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Roloff|1997|p=787}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine years later, he became financial councillor to the ''Generaldirektorium''. When the Prussian government fled to [[Königsberg]] after its defeat at Jena, he followed Stein there. It was there that he brought to bear his expertise on [[serfdom]] and it was his treatise that would help Stein write the October edict. Unlike Stein, Schön backed a greater liberalisation of landowning – for him, economic profitability had to take first priority, even if this was to the peasants' disadvantage.&lt;ref name="klein"&gt;{{harvp|Klein|1965|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1816, Schön became ''Oberpräsident'', a post he held for around 40 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=457}}&lt;/ref&gt; and devoted himself to the economic and social life of the provinces which he governed.&lt;ref name="klein" /&gt;

Schön also took part in editing the ''Rigaer Denkschrift''. In 1806 he travelled with a group of civil servants that had gathered around the just-dismissed Hardenberg – the group also included [[Karl vom Stein zum Altenstein]], [[Friedrich August von Stägemann]] and [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hensler|Twesten|1838|p=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niebuhr had studied law, philosophy and history at the university of Kiel between 1794 and 1796. In 1804 he was made head of the Danish national bank. His reputation as a financial expert quickly spread to Prussia. On 19 June 1806, Niebuhr and his family left for Riga with other civil servants to work with Hardenberg when he was dismissed. On 11 December 1809, he was made financial councillor and section chief for state debt. In 1810, he edited a note to the king in which he expressed strong doubts on whether a financial plan put in place by Hardenberg could be realised. Its tone he employed was so strong that the king disavowed him&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hensler|Twesten|1838|p=342}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so Niebuhr retired from politics.

The three other civil servants present at Riga – [[Karl vom Stein zum Altenstein]], [[Wilhelm Anton von Klewitz]] and [[Friedrich August von Stägemann]] – also played important rôles in the reforms. Altenstein became high financial councillor in the ''Generaldirektorium''. When Stein was dismissed in 1807, Altenstein and the minister of finances [[Friedrich Ferdinand Alexander zu Dohna-Schlobitten]] put in place the state reform conceived by Stein.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1810, Klewitz and Theodor von Schön edited the ''Verordnung über die veränderte Staatsverfassung aller obersten Staatsbehörden'' (''Decree on the new constitution of all the high portfolios of state''). Other collaborators took part in the reforms, such as Johann Gottfried Frey (chief of police in [[Königsberg]] and the real author of the ''Städteordnung''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schüler-Springorum|1996|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Friedrich Leopold Reichsfreiherr von Schrötter (who collaborated with Stein on the ''Städteordnung''), [[Christian Peter Wilhelm Beuth]] (in Prussian service since 1801, who had collaborated with Hardenberg on the fiscal and industrial laws) and Christian Friedrich Scharnweber (who had some influence on Hardenberg&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Vogel|1980|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Resurgence of Prussia==
[[File:An Mein Volk.jpg|thumb|upright|[[An Mein Volk]] – the Prussian king's appeal to his people on 17 March 1813]]
{{See also|German campaign (Napoleonic Wars)}}
From 1806 onwards isolated uprisings occurred in Germany and the German-speaking countries. On 26 August 1806 the bookseller [[Johann Philipp Palm]] was shot for publishing an anti-Napoleon pamphlet,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Radrizzani|2002|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a strong public outcry. In 1809, [[Andreas Hofer]] launched an insurrection in the Tyrol, but met the same fate as Palm. Anti-Napoleonic feeling developed little by little, with Germans feeling their spirits weighed down by the French occupation and Prussia still paying huge indemnities to the French. When Napoleon's 1812 [[French invasion of Russia|invasion of Russia]] met with disaster, it lit a glimmer of hope in Germany and above all in Prussia. On 30 December 1812, [[Hans David Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg|Yorck von Wartenburg]] signed the [[convention of Tauroggen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; by which Prussia in effect turned against Napoleon and repudiated the Treaty of Tilsit.

On 13 March 1813 Frederick William III made his '[[An Mein Volk]]' speech, making an appeal:
{{Cquote|To my people! ... Brandenburgers, Prussians, Silesians, Pomeranians, Lithuanians! You know what you have endured for nearly seven years, you know what will be your sad fate if we do not end with honour the fight we have begun. Remember past times, the Great Elector, the great Frederick [II]. Keep in your minds the good things our ancestors won under his command: freedom of conscience, honour, independence, trade, industry and science. Keep in your minds the great example of our powerful Russian allies, keep in your mind the Spanish, the Portuguese, even the lesser people who have declared war on powerful enemies to win the same good things and have gained victory [...] Great sacrifices are demanded of all classes, for our beginning is great and the numbers and resources of our enemies are great [...] But whatever the sacrifices demanded of the individual, they pale beside the holy goods for which we make them, for the things for which we fight and must win if we do not wish to stop being Prussians and Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=414}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The following 27 March Prussia declared war on France and the following 16–19 October saw the beginning of the end for Napoleonic power with the [[battle of Leipzig]]. On 1 October 1815 the Congress of Vienna opened and at it Harbenberg represented the victorious Kingdom of Prussia.

==Historiography==

===Early analyses===
[[File:Heinrich von Treitschke.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Heinrich von Treitschke]] long influenced the positive perception of the Prussian reforms from the 19th to the 20th century.]]
In late 19th century historiography, the Prussian reforms and the "revolution from above" were considered by [[Heinrich von Treitschke]] and others to be the first step in the foundation of the German Empire on the basis of a 'small-Germany' solution. For [[Friedrich Meinecke]], the reforms put in place the conditions necessary for the future evolution of Prussia and Germany. For a long time, under the influence of [[Leopold von Ranke]], the era of reforms was presented first and foremost as a story of the deeds and destinies of "great men", as shown by the large number of biographies written about the reformers – [[Hans Delbrück]] wrote about Gneisenau and Meinecke about Boyen, for example.

Indeed, it was the military reforms which first gained the researchers' interest. It was only with the biography of [[Max Lehmann]] that Stein's life and actions were analysed. Unlike Stein, the biographers paid little attention to Hardenberg. Despite the significant differences between Stein and Hardenberg, historiography saw a fundamental continuity between their approaches that made them one single unified policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|pp=235–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors, such as [[Otto Hintze]], underlined the role of reform programmes such as the ''Allgemeines Landrecht'' of 1794. One such continuity confirmed the theory that the reformers were already a distinct group before the reforms occurred. [[Thomas Nipperdey]] resumed the debate by writing that there had been reform plans before the disaster of 1806, but that those behind them had lacked the energy to put them into force and also lacked internal cohesion.&lt;ref name="Nipperdey_33"/&gt; As for the agricultural reforms, the works of Georg Friedrich Knapp aroused a controversy at the end of the 19th century – he criticised the reform policy, stating that it favoured the aristocrats' interests and not the peasants' interests. He held Adam Smith's liberal interest responsible for the evolution of certain problems. Research later led to a global critique which could not be maintained. After all, the peasants' properties were developed, even if the lands they gained were most often revealed to be poor soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|pp=239–241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuances in criticism===
[[File:Gaertner2.jpg|thumb|upright|It was only in 1848 that a plan for a constitution was discussed in the Sing-Akademie.]]
Today, the industrial reforms' success is also critiqued in a more nuanced way. They are considered not to have been the immediate reason for the artisans' misery, instead taken as the reduced influence of the legislation on their development. The historian Barbara Vogel tried to address an overall concept of agricultural and industrial approaches and to describe them as a "bureaucratic strategy of modernisation".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Vogel|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; When industrial development was taken into account, the policy of reforms is seen to certainly be centred on the encouragement of rural industry in the historic Prussian territories, thus allowing the onset of Prussia's [[industrial revolution]].

[[Reinhart Koselleck]] tried to give a general interpretation of the reform policy in view of the 1848 revolution, in his work ''Preußen zwischen Reform und Revolution'' (''Prussia between Reform and Revolution''). He distinguished three different processes. The ''Allgemeines Landrecht'' represented – at the time of its publication – a reaction to social problems, but remained attached to corporative elements. Koselleck saw the birth of an administrative state during the reform era and during the reinforcement of the administration between 1815 and 1825 as an anticipation of the later constitution. However, in his view, the following decades saw the political and social movement suppressed by the bureaucracy. After the end of the reform period, Koselleck underlined that there was a rupture in the equilibrium between the high level civil servants and the bourgeois of the 'Bildungsbürgertum' who could not become civil servants. According to him, the bureaucracy represented the general interest against the individual interest and no national representative body was set up for fear of seeing the reforming movement stopped.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Koselleck|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Standbild Heumarkt Köln - Gesamtansicht.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] in the [[Heumarkt]] in [[Cologne]], erected to the glory of Prussia – round its base are statues of the great Prussian reformers such as [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom Stein|Stein]], [[Karl August von Hardenberg|Hardenberg]], [[Heinrich Theodor von Schön|Schön]] and [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldt]]]]
[[File:Standbild Heumarkt Köln 1869 W. Gause.jpg|thumb|upright|Cologne monument (1878)]]
The historian Hans Rosenberg and later the representatives of the Bielefeld School supported the theory that the end of the process which would have led to a constitution in Prussia was one of the reasons for the end to its democratisation and for the ''[[Sonderweg]]''. Hans-Jürgen Puhle, professor at Frankfurt University, even held the Prussian regime to be "in the long term programmed for its own destruction".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Puhle|1980|p=15}}, cited in {{harvp|Langewiesche|1994|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers more orientated towards [[historicism]] such as Thomas Nipperdey underlined the divergence between the reformers' intentions and the unexpected later results of the reforms.

Several decades ago, the Prussian reforms from 1807 to 1819 lost their central position in historical study of 19th-century Germany. One contributing factor to this decline is that the reforms in the states of the Confederation of the Rhine were considered as similar by several historians. Another is that the Prussian regions – dynamic in industry and society – belonged to the French sphere of influence directly or indirectly until the end of the [[First French Empire|Napoleonic era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|pp=241–246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorials to the reformers==

===Statues===
Several statues of the reformers were set up, especially of Stein. In 1870 a statue of Stein by [[Hermann Schievelbein]] was put up on the [[Dönhoffplatz]] in Berlin. Around its base can be read "To minister Baron vom Stein. The recognition of the fatherland.".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Stamm-Kuhlmann|2001|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; A statue of Hardenberg by Martin Götze was also put up beside it in 1907. Stein's statue now stands in front of the [[Landtag of Prussia]] in Berlin.

===Cologne memorial===
One of the most important monuments to the reformers is that in the Heumarkt in [[Cologne]], made up of an equestrian statue of Frederick William III by Gustav Blaeser on a base surrounded by statues of important figures of the era, including several Prussian reformers: Stein, Hardenberg, Gneisenau, Scharnhorst, Humboldt, Schön, Niebuhr and Beuth. The monument's design process had been launched in 1857&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Reihlen|1988|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was inaugurated on 26 September 1878, with a medal marking the occasion bearing [[William I of Germany]] and his wife on the obverse and the monument and the phrase "To king Frederick William III, the Rhine states recognise him" on the reverse. The monument recalled the Berlin [[equestrian statue of Frederick the Great]], designed by [[Christian Daniel Rauch]], master of Blaeser.

===Other===
Stein featured on commemorative stamps in 1957 and 2007 and Humboldt in 1952, whilst several streets are now named after the reformers, especially in Berlin, which has a Humboldtstraße, a Hardenbergstraße, a Freiherr-vom-Stein-Straße, a Niebuhrstraße, a Gneisenaustraße and a Scharnhorststraße.

[[File:1888DemocraticPoster 2.png|thumb|''Public office is a public trust'']]
The concept of the '''public trust''' relates back to the origins of [[democratic government]] and its seminal idea that within the public lies the true power and future of a society; therefore, whatever ''trust'' the public places in its officials must be respected.
One of the reasons that [[bribery]] is regarded as a notorious [[evil]] is that it contributes to a culture of [[political corruption]] in which the public trust is eroded. Other issues related to political corruption or betrayal of public trust are [[lobbying]], special [[interest group]]s and the public [[cartel]].

==Use in the Philippines==
{{See also|Impeachment in the Philippines}}
In the Philippines, "betrayal of public trust" is one of the impeachable offenses. In ''Francisco, Jr. vs. Nagmamalasakit na mga Manananggol ng mga Manggagawang Pilipino, Inc.,'' the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] ruled that the definition of "betrayal of public trust" is "a non-justiciable political question which is beyond the scope of its judicial power" under the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Francisco, Jr. v. Nagmamalasakit na mga Manananggol ng mga Manggagawang Pilipino, Inc. |vol=415 |reporter= SCRA |opinion=44 |pinpoint=105 |court=[[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] |date=2003 |url=http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2003/nov2003/160261.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It did not prescribe which branch of government has the power to define it, but implies that Congress, which handles impeachment cases, has the power to do so.

'''Right-wing terrorism''' is [[terrorism]] motivated by a variety of ideologies and beliefs, including [[Islamophobia]], [[anti-communism]], [[neo-fascism]] and [[neo-Nazism]]. This type of terrorism has been sporadic, with little or no international cooperation.{{sfn|Aubrey|2004|p= 45}} Modern radical right-wing terrorism first appeared in [[Western Europe]] in the 1970s and it first appeared in [[Eastern Europe]] following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Moghadam|Eubank|2006|p=57}}

Right-wing terrorists aim to overthrow governments and replace them with [[nationalism|nationalist]] or [[fascism|fascist]]-oriented regimes.{{sfn|Aubrey|2004|p= 45}} The core of this movement includes [[white power skinhead|neo-fascist skinheads]], [[Far-right politics|far-right]] [[Football hooliganism|hooligans]], youth sympathisers and intellectual guides who believe that the state must rid itself of foreign elements in order to protect its ''rightful'' citizens.{{sfn|Moghadam|Eubank|2006|pp=57-58}} However, they usually lack a rigid ideology.{{sfn|Moghadam|Eubank|2006|p=58}}

== Causes ==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
Armin Falk and colleagues suggests that Right-Wing Extremist Crime (REC), which includes anti-foreigner and racist motivations, is associated with unemployment rates (261). Consequently, as unemployment rates increase, REC also increases. This correlation can be found in several countries including Germany, United States, and the United Kingdom. Additionally, this phenomenon is not necessarily associated with individuals, rather unemployment impacts society's humanitarian values of tolerance and altruism. Meaning, as unemployment rates increase, humanitarian values of tolerance and altruism decrease according to Falk. This cause of right-wing terrorism can be associated with a functionalist perspective on employment. Ferrante defines a functionalist approach as "how the parts of society contribute in expected and unexpected way of maintain an existing social order" (26). Work and employment serve several functions for society (University of Minnesota 12.2). The University of Minnesota Library suggests that employment provides workers with an income and also contributes to their self-identity and fulfillment (12.2). When employment is low, this leads to a perceived threat towards self-identity and fulfillment which can then lead to a larger possibility for right-wing terrorism to occur.

A second cause of right-wing terrorism as Thomas Greven suggests, is [[populism]], or more accurately, [[right-wing populism]]. Jan-Werner Muller describes populism as a form of [[identity politics]] that is inherently anti-establishment and anti-pluralist (3). More simply put, populism supports the advancement of 'the average citizen', and it does not support the agendas of the privileged elite.  Furthermore, Greven defines right-wing populist as those who support [[ethnocentrism]], and [[opposition to immigration|oppose immigration]] (3).  Right-wing populist policies that have recently been covered in the media include the [[Executive Order 13769]], which is the travel ban from Muslim-majority countries to the United States, and the [[Immigration policy of Donald Trump]] which proposes that a wall should be built between the United States and Mexico in order to prevent illegal immigrants from coming to the United States. Greven suggests that immigration policy not only threatens economic competition, but also threatens traditional values and identities (5).  Due to the ethnocentric motivations behind these policies, they are classified as right-wing populism. Because right-wing populism creates a climate of 'us versus them', terrorism is more likely to occur according to Greven. This cause of right-wing terrorism can be associated with a conflict perspective. Ferrante explains the conflict perspective as a focus on conflict regarding scarce resources and the strategies advantaged groups used to perpetuate social agreement arrangements from which they benefit (30). When people feel as though their traditional values are being threatened by the social elite who contribute to the rise in immigration, conflict ensues, and terrorism follows.

===South Africa===
In 1993 [[Chris Hani]], the General Secretary of the [[South African Communist Party]] was murdered by Polish-born far-right anti-Communist [[Janusz Waluś]] who had been lent a firearm by far-right pro-Apartheid MP [[Clive Derby-Lewis]].
The [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]], a neo-Nazi paramilitary organisation, has often been described as terrorist. 
In 2010 South African authorities foiled a plot by far-right terrorists to commit attacks as revenge for the murder of [[Eugène Terre'Blanche]], seizing explosives and firearms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/07/south-africa-white-extremist-bomb|title=South African police foil white extremist bomb plot|first=David|last=Smith|date=7 May 2010|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Americas ==
=== Brazil ===
During [[Brazilian military government|Brazil's military government]], some right-wing military engaged in violent repression. The [[Riocentro#1981 May Day Attack|Riocentro 1981 May Day Attack]] was a bombing attempt that happened on the night of April 30, 1981. Severe casualties were suffered by the terrorists. While an NGO held a fundraiser fighting for democracy and free elections and celebrating the upcoming holiday, a bomb exploded at Riocentro parking area killing army seargent Guilherme Pereira do Rosário and severely wounding captain Wilson Dias Machado, who survived the bomb explosion. The bomb exploded inside a car where both were preparing it. Rosário died instantaneously. They were the only casualties.

The [[Para-SAR]] example&lt;ref name="para-sar2-br"&gt;{{cite news|title=Brasileiros magazine|url=http://brasileiros.com.br/2014/03/o-paraquedista-que-evitou-um-banho-de-sangue/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="para-sar1-br"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fatos magazine|date=June 1, 1985|url=http://www.arqanalagoa.ufscar.br/pdf/recortes/R04927.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; was revealed by [[Brazilian Air Force]] captain Sérgio Ribeiro Miranda de Carvalho in 1968 before it reached the execution phase as it was made public to the press after a meeting with his superior Brigadier General João Paulo Burnier and chief of Para-SAR unity. Burnier discussed a secret plan to bomb a dense traffic area of [[Rio de Janeiro]] known as "[[Gasômetro]]" during commute and later claim that Communists were the perpetrators. He expected to be able to run a witch-hunt against the growing political military opposition. Burnier also mentioned his intentions on making the Para-SAR, a [[Brazilian Air Force]] rescue unity, a tool for eliminating some military government political oppositors throwing them to the sea at a wide distance of the coast. On both of these events, no military involved on these actions or planning was arrested, charged or faced retaliation from the [[Brazilian military government]]. The only exception is captain Sérgio de Carvalho which had to leave the air force for facing his superiors retaliation after whistleblowing brigadier Burnier's plan.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Count of "victims killed" and "victims wounded" excludes attackers.

A report in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', published on November 25, 2018, showed violent right-wing-related incidents up, and left-wing-related incidents down.  Total domestic terrorism incidents was down to 41 in 2001, from a high of 468 in 1970, but then went up to 65 in 2017. Of those 65 events in 2017, 36 were right-wing-related (with 11 fatalities), 10 were left-wing-related (with 6 fatalities), 7 were related to Islamist extremism (with 16 fatalities), and 12, including the [[2017 Las Vegas shooting]], were categorized as "Other/Unknown" (with 62 fatalities, including 58 from the Las Vegas incident). The report found that 2018 was a particularly deadly year, with 11 people dying in the [[Pittsburgh synagogue shooting]], 2 others in an incident in Kentucky, and two more in a [[2018 Tallahassee shooting|shooting in Tallasshee]].  All three incidents were right-wing related.&lt;ref name=wapo112518&gt;Lowery, Wesley; Kindy, Kimberly; and Ba Tran, Andrew (November 25, 2018) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/in-the-united-states-right-wing-violence-is-on-the-rise/2018/11/25/61f7f24a-deb4-11e8-85df-7a6b4d25cfbb_story.html "In the United States, right-wing violence is on the rise"] ''[[The Washington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Post'' reported that the upsurge in right-wing violence began during the [[Barack Obama administration]] and picked up steam under the presidency of [[Donald Trump]], whose remarks after the [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlotteville, Virginia]] in 2017 that there were "some very fine people on both sides" is widely seen as giving confidence to the right that the administration looked favorably on their goals, providing them with "tacit support". A former FBI assistant director for counterintelligence, is quoted as saying that "[political leaders] from the White House down, used to serve as a check on conduct and speech that was abhorrent to most people. I see that eroding. ... The current political rhetoric is at least enabling, and certainly not discouraging, violence."&lt;ref name=wapo112518 /&gt;

According to analysis by the newspaper of data from the [[Global Terrorism Database]], 92 of 263 domestic terrorism events &amp;ndash; 35% &amp;ndash;  that occurred from 2010 to 2017 were right-wing related, while 38 (14%) were Islamist extremist-related, and 34 (13%) were left-wing related.   Not only that, but a criminologist from [[John Jay College]] stated that right-wing attacks were statistically more likely to result in fatalities.&lt;ref name=wapo112518 /&gt;

== Europe ==

===Denmark===
Neo-Nazis were suspected to have perpetrated the [[1992 Copenhagen bombing]], in which the office of a left-wing socialist party was attacked, killing one of its members.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.b.dk/nationalt/afdoed-nynazist-haevdes-at-staa-bag-brevbombe?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
In the town of [[Toulon]], a far-right extremist group called SOS-France existed. On 18 August 1986, four members were driving a car carrying explosives, apparently in an attempt to bomb the offices of [[SOS Racisme]]. However it exploded while they were still in it, killing all four of them.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.apnews.com/b94eda4f669fd78ae616120b07cf66e8&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-Nazi members of the [[French and European Nationalist Party]] were responsible for a pair of [[1988 Cannes and Nice attacks|anti-immigrant terror bombings]] in 1988. Sonacotra hostels in [[Cagnes-sur-Mer]] and Cannes were bombed, killing Romanian immigrant George Iordachescu and injuring 16 people, mostly Tunisians. In an attempt to [[False flag|frame Jewish extremists]] for the Cagnes-sur-Mer bombing, the terrorists left leaflets bearing [[Star of David|Stars of David]] and the name [[Masada]] at the scene, with the message "To destroy [[Israel]], Islam has chosen the sword. For this choice, Islam will perish."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greenhouse|first1=Steven|title=Immigrant Hostel Bombed in France|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/20/world/immigrant-hostel-bombed-in-france.html|accessdate=20 October 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=20 December 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 May 2008, members of the neo-Nazi Nomad 88 group fired with machine guns at people from their car in [[Saint-Michel-sur-Orge]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2008/06/03/un-groupuscule-neonazi-a-l-origine-d-une-fusillade_1053066_3224.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leparisien.fr/essonne/le-groupuscule-neonazi-decide-de-s-autodissoudre-04-06-2008-3298544168.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, in the aftermath of the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting]], six mosques and a restaurant were attacked in acts deemed as right-wing terrorism by authorities.&lt;ref name="Europol16"/&gt; The acts included grenade throwing, shooting, and use of an [[improvised explosive device]].

=== Germany ===
{{See also|Far-right politics in Germany|Terrorism in Germany}}

In 1980, a [[Oktoberfest terror attack|right-wing terrorist attack in Munich, Germany]] killed the attacker and 12 other people, injuring 215. Fears of an ongoing campaign of major right-wing terrorist attacks did not materialize.{{sfn|Aubrey|2004|p=45}}

In addition to several bank robberies, the German [[National Socialist Underground]] was responsible for the [[Bosphorus serial murders]] (2000–2006), the [[2004 Cologne bombing]] and the murder of policewoman [[Michéle Kiesewetter]] in 2007. In November 2011, two members of the National Socialist Underground committed suicide after a bank robbery and a third member was arrested some days later.

Right-wing extremist offenses in Germany rose sharply in 2015 and 2016.&lt;ref name="Bleiker"&gt;Carla Bleiker, [http://www.dw.com/en/sharp-rise-in-right-wing-crime-in-germany-just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg/a-19041652 Sharp rise in right-wing crime in Germany just 'the tip of the iceberg'],  [[Deutsche Welle]] (February 11, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Figures from the German government tallied 316 violent xenophobic offences in 2014 and 612 such offenses in 2015.&lt;ref name="Bleiker"/&gt;

In August 2014, a group of four Germans founded a [[Munich]]-based far-right terrorist group, the {{ill|Oldschool Society|de}}.  The group, which held racist, antisemitic, and anti-Muslim views, eventually attracted 30 members.&lt;ref name="APOldschoolsentence"&gt;Associated Press, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/15/germany-far-right-terrorist-group-four-jailed Four jailed in Germany for forming far-right terrorist group] (March 15, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; They stockpiled weapons and explosives and plotted to attack a refugee shelter in [[Saxony]],&lt;ref name="APOldschoolsentence"/&gt; but the group's leaders were arrested in May 2015 before carrying out the attack.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Brady, [http://www.dw.com/en/oldschool-society-neo-nazis-go-on-trial-for-refugee-home-attacks/a-19217024 'Oldschool Society' neo-Nazis go on trial for refugee home attacks], [[Deutsche Welle]] (April 27, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017 four of the group's leaders were sentenced to prison terms.&lt;ref name="APOldschoolsentence"/&gt; The perpetrator of the [[2016 Munich shooting]] also had far-right views.

=== Italy ===
In the 1970s and 1980s, Italy endured the [[Years of Lead (Italy)|Years of Lead]], a period characterized by frequent terrorist attacks: between 1969 and 1982, the nation suffered 8,800 terrorist attacks, in which a total of 351 people were killed and 768 were injured.&lt;ref name="Hof"&gt;Tobias Hof, "The Success of Italian Anti-terrorism Policy" in ''An International History of Terrorism: Western and Non-Western Experiences'' (editors Jussi M. Hanhimäki &amp; Bernhard Blumenau: Routledge, 2013), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; The terrorist attacks have been both ascribed to the far-left and the far-right, yet a lot of terrorist attacks remain without a clear culprit and a lot of people have claimed the authorship of them is to be ascribed to rogue members of the Italian secret service. Even some of the terrorist attacks ascribed to a particular political group may be in reality the work of these rogue agents: this has been claimed, among many others, by [[Francesco Cossiga]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2006/11/21/italia/politica/cossiga-le-spie-ve-le-racconto-io-pAUXKv2TCn4Yp824sScL1O/pagina.html |title=Cossiga: «Le spie?

The [[Years of Lead]] are considered to have begun with the [[Piazza Fontana bombing]] in [[Milan]] in December 1969,&lt;ref name="Hof"/&gt; perpetrated by [[Ordine Nuovo]], a right-wing [[neofascist]] group.&lt;ref name="McHugh"&gt;Richard McHugh, "Ordine Nuovo" in ''The SAGE Encyclopedia of Terrorism'', 2d ed. (editor Gus Martin: SAGE Publications, 2011), pp. 451-52.&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen people were killed, and 90 injured, in the bombing.&lt;ref name="McHugh"/&gt;

In July 1970, this same group carried out a bombing on a train going from Rome to Messina, killing six and wounding almost 100.  The group also carried out the [[Piazza della Loggia bombing]] in 1974, killing eight antifascist activists.&lt;ref name="McHugh"/&gt; Perhaps the most infamous right-wing terrorist attack in post-war Italy is the  [[August 1980 Bologna bombing]], in which neo-fascist [[Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari]] ("Armed Revolutionary Nuclei"), an Ordine Nuovo offshoot, killed 85 people and injured 200 at the [[Bologna Centrale railway station|Bologna railroad station]].&lt;ref name="McHugh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1988Convictions"&gt;[http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1988/Four-Convicted-Of-Mass-Murder-In-Italian-Bombing-That-Killed-85/id-370c14ae3f77e87d266b0257bf7d2f62 Four Convicted of Mass Murder in Italian Bombing that Killed 85], Associated Press (July 11, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Valerio Fioravanti]], Francesca Mambro, and two others were convicted of mass murder in the attacks,&lt;ref name="1988Convictions"/&gt; although both have always denied any connection with them.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Cento Bull &amp; Philip Cooke, ''Ending Terrorism in Italy'' (Routledge, 2013), pp. 141-42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anne Hanley, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-accidental-terrorist-1259973.html The accidental terrorist], ''Independent'' (May 5, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

First he bombed several government buildings in [[Oslo]], killing eight people and injuring more than 30. After the bombings, he went to [[Utøya]] island in a fake police uniform and began firing on people attending a political youth camp for the [[Workers' Youth League (Norway)|Worker's Youth League]] (AUF), a left-wing political party, killing 68 and injuring more than 60.

===Poland===
{{See also|Far-right politics in Poland}}
Despite the country being nearly ethnically and religiously homogenous, Polish far-right targets, via propaganda or physical violence, religious and ethnic minorities such as Jews, [[Romani people]], people with darker complexion or Middle Eastern appearance. In 1991, an [[Mława riot|anti-Romani pogrom broke out in Mława]]. During the [[UEFA Euro 2012]], Polish hooligans targeted random Russian football supporters. There have been reports of hate crimes targeting the [[Islam in Poland|Muslim minority in Poland]].

=== Russia ===
[[The Savior (paramilitary organization)|The Savior]] was a [[neo-Nazi]] militant [[nationalist]] organization which claimed credit for the August [[2006 Moscow market bombing]], which killed 13.

On 22 April 2017, A gunman 'with hatred for ethnic minorities' shot and killed two people in an attack in a Federal Security Service office in the Russian city of Khabarovsk.

=== Sweden ===
Both the [[2009–10 Malmö shootings]] and the [[Trollhättan school attack]] were conducted by right-wing terrorists along with a refugee centre bombing in 2017.

In April 1999, David Copeland, a neo-Nazi, planted a [[1999 London nail bombings|series of nail bombs]] over 13 days. His attacks, which were aimed at London's [[Black people|black]], [[British Bangladeshi|Bangladeshi]] and [[Homosexual|gay]] communities, resulted in three dead and more than 100 injured.&lt;ref name=Buncombe&gt;Buncombe, Andrew; Judd, Terri; and Bennett, Jason.

In 2012, the British Home Affairs Committee warned of the threat of far right terrorism in the UK, claiming it had heard "persuasive evidence" about the potential danger and cited the growth of similar threats across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16900108 | work=BBC News | title=Home Affairs Committee warns of far-right terror threat | date=February 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of [[Combat 18]] (C18), a [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] organisation based on the concept of "[[leaderless resistance]]", have been suspected in numerous deaths of immigrants, non-whites and other C18 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/1672100.stm | work=BBC News | title=Ex-Combat 18 man speaks out | date=25 November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1998 and 2000, dozens of members were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1999/03/07/narm07.html "MI5 swoops on Army 'neo-Nazis'"], ''Sunday Telegraph'', 7 March 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/programmes/2001/bnp_special/membership/organisers/adrian_marsden.stm BNP Under the skin: Profile of Adrian Marsden], ''BBC News''&lt;/ref&gt; A group calling itself the [[Racial Volunteer Force]] split from C18 in 2002, retaining close links to its parent organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meta-religion.com/Extremism/White_extremism/Combat_18/combat_18.htm "Combat 18"] at www.metareligion.com&lt;/ref&gt; Some journalists believed that the [[White Wolves]] were a C18 splinter group, alleging that the group had been set up by [[Del O'Connor]], the former second-in-command of C18 and member of [[Skrewdriver]] Security.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Millar, [https://www.theguardian.com/bombs/Story/0,2763,204778,00.html "Anti-terror police seek White Wolf racist over bombs"]&lt;/ref&gt; C18 attacks on immigrants continued through 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/belfast-racists--threaten-to-cut-romanian-babys-throat-14341494.html "Belfast racists threaten to cut Romanian baby's throat"], ''Belfast Telegraph'', 17 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Weapons, ammunition and explosives were seized by police in the UK and almost every country in which C18 was active.

In 2016, [[Jo Cox]], the [[Member of parliament|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for the [[Batley and Spen (UK Parliament constituency)|Batley and Spen]] constituency [[Murder of Jo Cox|was murdered]] by Thomas Mair, who was motivated by far-right political views and had connections to several far-right organisations in the UK, US, and South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Cobain and Matthew Taylor, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/23/thomas-mair-found-guilty-of-jo-cox-murder Far-right terrorist Thomas Mair jailed for life for Jo Cox murder], ''Guardian'' (November 23, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20989">{{Politics of Switzerland}}
The '''right of foreigners to vote in Switzerland''' is an ongoing political issue in the country.  [[Switzerland]] is a [[Federalism|federal nation]]. As such, the [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] have extensive powers to enact their own legislation (similar to the arrangement in the [[List of states and territories of the United States|states of the United States]]). For this reason, the rules regarding the [[Right of foreigners to vote|rights of foreign residents to vote]] differ considerably throughout Switzerland.

At federal level, exercising one's political rights in the strictest sense (the right to stand for election and to vote in [[Popular initiative (Switzerland)|popular initiatives]] and [[referendum]]s) is limited to Swiss citizens aged 18 or over, as prescribed by Articles 136, 143 and 150 of the [[Swiss Federal Constitution]]. A bill proposing granting foreign residents the right to vote in federal elections was submitted to the [[Swiss Federal Council|Federal Council]] on 4 October 2000 but was rejected on 4 October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parlament.ch/f/suche/pages/geschaefte.aspx?gesch_id=20003512|title=Geschäft Ansehen|website=www.parlament.ch|access-date=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Article 36(1) of the Federal Constitution, the cantons have the power to grant political rights in cantonal and municipal elections which go beyond the minimum federal threshold (such as lowering the [[voting age]] and extending the right to vote to foreign nationals). The cantons also have the option to delegate these powers to the [[Municipalities of Switzerland|communes]]. Therefore, in theory, foreigners can be elected to the [[Council of States (Switzerland)|Council of States]], as Article 150(3) of the Constitution states: "The Cantons determine the rules for the election of their representatives to the Council of States."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19995395/201506140000/101.pdf|title=English version of the Swiss Federal Constitution|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afpr.ch/pdf/afpr3635a.pdf|title=Problèmes d'intégration des ressortissants étrangers en Suisse|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Office fédéral des migrations sur mandat du chef du Département fédéral de justice et police|access-date=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only the cantons of [[Canton of Jura|Jura]] and [[Canton of Neuchâtel|Neuchâtel]] grant foreigners the right to vote in cantonal elections, but neither allow foreigners to stand for election at cantonal level.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.avenir-suisse.ch/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2015-09_as_eligibilite-des-etrangers_hp.pdf|title=Pour la participation des étrangers au niveau local.

== Aargau ==
In 1996, a referendum was held to decide whether to grant to foreigners the right to vote and stand for election in the [[Aargau|Canton of Aargau]]. The proposal was rejected by voters.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.federalism.ch/files/Newsletter/742_12/JU-NE-etrangers-f.pdf|title=Jura et Neuchâtel : L’extension du droit d’éligibilité des étrangers se poursuit|last=Gassmann|first=Jean-Luc|date=June 2007|website=|publisher=University of Fribourg|access-date=4 March 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210103657/http://www.federalism.ch/files/Newsletter/742_12/JU-NE-etrangers-f.pdf|archivedate=10 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appenzell Ausserrhoden ==
Article 105(2) of the [[Appenzell Ausserrhoden]] Cantonal Constitution of 30 April 1995 gives the communes of this canton the freedom to grant (or not) political rights to foreigners, provided that such foreigners have been resident in Switzerland for at least ten years and have lived in the canton for at least five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/sr/131_224_1/a105.html|title=SR 131.224.1 Verfassung des Kantons Appenzell A.

== Basel-Stadt ==
The [[Basel-Stadt|Canton of Basel-Stadt]] has a large foreign population – 50,000 people, who make up 30% of the total population.  In 2005, the canton inserted a clause into its constitution (which entered into force on 13 November 2006) giving each of its three communes ([[Basel]], [[Bettingen]] and [[Riehen]]) the power to extend the right to vote and stand for election at municipal level to “residents other than those who hold Swiss nationality who are at least 18 years of age”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.admin.ch/ch/f/rs/131_222_1/a40.html|title=RS 131.222.1 Constitution du canton de Bâle-Ville, du 23 mars 2005|last=P|first=Bundeskanzlei -|website=www.admin.ch|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, only the two autonomous communes (Bettingen and Riehen) have this power, as Basel is administered directly by the canton.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ge.ch/constituante/doc/presse/CoT2_Rapport_complet_DPE_251109.pdf|title=Les droits politiques des étrangers Rapport préliminaire no 1|last=|first=|date=25 November 2009|website=|publisher=Assemblée constituante de la République et Canton de Genève|access-date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bern ==
In April 2005, the Grand Council (parliament) of the [[Canton of Bern]] refused by 98 votes to 86 a bill from the cantonal government to grant the communes the freedom to grant (or not) foreigners the right to vote at municipal level. Had this bill been approved, it would have allowed foreigners the right to vote provided that they had lived in Switzerland for at least ten years, in the canton for at least five years and in the same commune for at least three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.minorites.org/article.php?IDA=8525|title=Le Grand Conseil bernois refuse le droit de vote aux étrangers|last=|first=|date=18 April 2005|website=Swissinfo|publisher=|access-date=4 March 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050501015758/http://www.minorites.org/article.php?IDA=8525|archivedate=1 May 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar bill, brought by the Bern [[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland|Social Democratic Party]] and the Independent Socialist Party, was rejected on 25 January 2007 by 77 votes to 73, although it was again supported by the cantonal government. Opponents to the bill primarily came from the bourgeois bloc, the [[Swiss People's Party|Swiss People’s Party]] and the [[Free Democratic Party of Switzerland|Free (or “Radical”) Democratic Party]], although the latter had been in favour of the 2005 bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.org/fre/recherche/detail/A_Berne_les_etrangers_resteront_muets.html|title=A Berne, les étrangers resteront muets|last=|first=|date=23 January 2007|website=Swissinfo|publisher=|access-date=4 March 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110224113254/http://www.swissinfo.org/fre/recherche/detail/A_Berne_les_etrangers_resteront_muets.html |archivedate=24 February 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, a popular initiative supported by the socialists, the [[Green Party of Switzerland|Green Party]] and the [[Swiss Federation of Trade Unions]] gained enough signatures (12,500) to amend the Bern Cantonal Constitution to allow each commune to decide whether to grant voting rights to foreign residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rfj.ch/rjb/Actualite/Regionale/11808Initiative-pour-le-droit-de-vote-des-etrangers-dans-le-canton-de-Berne-.html|title=Initiative pour le droit de votes des étrangers dans le canton de Berne|last=|first=|date=11 August 2008|website=Radio Jura bernois|publisher=|access-date=4 March 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110224055259/http://www.rfj.ch/rjb/Actualite/Regionale/11808Initiative-pour-le-droit-de-vote-des-etrangers-dans-le-canton-de-Berne-.html |archivedate=24 February 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent referendum was rejected by voters on 26 September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lematin.ch/actu/suisse/berne-bale-ville-refusent-droit-vote-etrangers-327789|title=Le Matin, l'actualité en direct: sports, people, politique, économie, multimédia|website=www.lematin.ch|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fribourg ==
The new constitution of the [[Canton of Fribourg]], adopted on 16 May 2004, states in Article 48: “The following have the right to vote and stand for election at municipal level, providing that they are of voting age: […] foreigners and foreigners resident in their respective commune who have been resident in the canton for at least five years and who have a residence permit.”

The Law of 16 March 2005 granting political rights to foreigners and to Swiss citizens living abroad amended the Law on the exercising of political rights, bringing the latter into conformity with the new constitution. This law also states: “any person who enjoys political rights at municipal level may stand for election.”

== Geneva ==
On 24 April 2005, 52.3% of voters in the [[Canton of Geneva]] approved an initiative granting voting rights at municipal level to foreigners who have lived in the canton for at least eight years. Another initiative granting foreigners the right to stand for election gained only 47.2% support. Geneva became the sixth canton in Switzerland to grant political rights to foreign residents.

This vote came after four unsuccessful earlier attempts. On 17 June 1979, 56.3% of voters rejected an initiative to grant foreigners the right to vote and stand for election at industrial-tribunal elections. On 6 June 1993, 71.3% of voters refused an initiative granting foreigners the right to vote and stand for election at municipal level. On 28 November 1993, the same percentage of voters refused a second initiative granting foreigners only the right to vote. On 4 March 2001, 52% of voters refused an initiative to create a constitutional law granting foreigners the right to vote and stand for election at municipal level.

Article 42 of the Cantonal Constitution was amended to allow foreign residents the right to vote at municipal elections provided that they have been legally resident in Switzerland for at least eight years. However, foreign residents do not have the right to stand for election.

The constitutional provision relating to foreigners’ voting rights is directly enforceable and applicable. However, a bill amending the Law on the exercising of political rights was approved on 14 September 2005 to bring legislation in line with the constitution.

== Glarus ==
At a [[Landsgemeinde]] on 2 May 2010, the voters of the [[Canton of Glarus]] rejected a proposal to grant foreigners the right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tdg.ch/actu/suisse/glaris-refuse-droit-vote-etrangers-2010-05-02|title=Glarus refuse le droit de vote aux étrangers|last=|first=|date=2 May 2010|website=Agence télégraphique suisse|publisher=|access-date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Graubünden ==
Article 9 of the Constitution of the [[Graubünden|Canton of Graubünden]] of 14 September 2003 enshrines Swiss citizens’ right to vote at cantonal level, but does not exclude this right being extended to foreigners, as it is up to the legislator to determine the details. No actual law was adopted to grant voting rights to foreigners.

Article 9 also states that the communes have the discretion to decide (or not) to grant foreigners both the right to vote and the right to stand for election. Ten of the canton’s 208 communes have made use of this power: [[Bever, Switzerland|Bever]], [[Bonaduz]], [[Calfreisen|Calfreise]], [[Cazis]], [[Conters im Prättigau]], [[Fideris]], [[Lüen]], [[Masein]], [[Portein]] (which merged into the commune of Cazis on 1 January 2010) and [[Schnaus]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.auslaenderstimmrecht.ch/jyvis-jyvote/deja-une-realite.php|title=Cantons et communes en Suisse accordant le droit actif de vote aux étrangers|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=4 March 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412210827/http://www.auslaenderstimmrecht.ch/jyvis-jyvote/deja-une-realite.php|archivedate=12 April 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jura ==
When the [[Canton of Jura]] was formed in 1978, it immediately granted foreigners the right to vote.

The Cantonal Constitution grants voting rights to citizens “holding Swiss nationality” and states in Article 73: “the law defines and regulates the right to vote and other political rights of foreigners.”

Article 3 of the Law of 26 October 1978 on political rights states that foreigners may vote in municipal elections provided that they have been resident in the canton for at least ten years and in their respective commune for at least 30 days. It states that foreigners enjoying the right to vote can also stand for election at municipal level.

This law also grants foreigners the right to vote at cantonal elections, under the sole condition that they have been resident in the canton for at least ten years.

On 21 February 2007, the cantonal parliament passed a law (by 51 votes to 4) granting foreigners the right to stand for election as mayor. All such candidates must have lived regularly in Switzerland for at least ten years, including at least one year in the Canton of Jura.

On 17 June 2007, the voters of Jura voted against a law allowing foreigners to stand for election, therefore revoking the earlier law.

On 28 September 2014, the cantonal government approved (by 54% of votes) a proposal re-granting foreigners the right to stand for election to all municipal offices except that of mayor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rts.ch/info/regions/jura/6179408-les-etrangers-pourront-etre-elus-au-plan-communal-dans-le-jura.html|title=Les étrangers pourront être élus au plan communal dans le Jura|website=rts.ch|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lucerne ==
Article 15(2) of the draft of the new constitution of the [[Canton of Lucerne]] allowed communes the discretion to grant (or not) foreigners the right to vote in municipal elections. However, this clause did not appear in the version of the constitution that was approved by popular vote on 17 June 2007.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Neuchâtel ==
The [[Canton of Neuchâtel]] has allowed foreigners to vote in municipal elections since 1849. It briefly abolished this right but then reinstated it in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christ|first=Thierry|date=June 2002|title=" Il est juste que ceux qui paient puisse voir ce qu'on fait de leur argent ": Le droit de vote des étrangers dans les débats politiques neuchâtelois de la seconde moitié du XIXe siècle|journal=Revue Historique Neuchâteloise|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Law of 17 October 1984 on political rights allows foreigners to vote in municipal elections provided that they are “in a regular situation” and have been resident in the canton for at least a year. Foreigners are also allowed to stand for election.

An amendment to the Cantonal Constitution in 2000 granted foreigners the right to vote in cantonal elections provided that they have been resident in the canton for at least five years.

In 1850, Neuchâtel granted foreign residents the right to vote, but not to stand for election, in municipal elections. During the [[19th century]], not even Swiss citizens were automatically guaranteed the right to stand for election if they originated from a different canton.

In June 2007, voters rejected a cantonal initiative that proposed granting foreigners the right to stand for election.

2016 saw the rules changed for both municipal and cantonal elections. At municipal level, foreigners and stateless persons who have been resident in a commune of the canton, have a residence permit (“Permis C”) and have been resident in the canton for at least one year are now allowed to stand for election. They may now also stand for election at cantonal level under the same requirements except they must have been resident in the canton for at least five years.

== Schaffhausen ==
In 2001, the voters of the [[Canton of Schaffhausen]] rejected a popular initiative proposing granting foreigners the right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stimm- und Wahlrecht für Ausländerinnen und Ausländer|last=Heusser|first=Pierre|publisher=Schulthess Juristische Medien|year=2001|isbn=9783725542567|location=Zurich|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 September 2014, voters again rejected (by 85% of the vote) a proposal allowing foreigners to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/fre/le-projet-de-fusion-entre-les-deux-b%25C3%25A2le-a-une-nouvelle-fois-%25C3%25A9chou%25C3%25A9/40804708|title=Le projet de fusion entre les deux Bâle a une nouvelle fois échoué - SWI swissinfo.ch|website=SWI swissinfo.ch|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Solothurn ==
In 1997, the voters of the [[Canton of Solothurn]] rejected (by 88.5% of the vote) a proposal allowing foreigners to vote.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Thurgau ==
Article 19 of the Constitution of the [[Thurgau|Canton of Thurgau]] and Article 2(1) of the Law on political rights allows the communes to grant (or not) foreigners the right to vote at municipal level. As of 2009, only two communes – [[Langrickenbach]] and [[Lengwil]] – had taken up this option.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Uri ==
The voters of the [[Canton of Uri]] rejected a popular initiative (by 84% of votes) proposing allowing foreigners complete political rights at both municipal and cantonal level.

== Vaud ==
Article 142 of the new Constitution of the [[Vaud|Canton of Vaud]], of 14 April 2003, specifies: “the following make up the electorate: […] foreigners who have been resident in commune anywhere in Switzerland and held a residence permit for at least ten years and have also been resident in the canton for at least three years.” In order to transpose the constitutional provision, the Law on the exercising of political rights was amended in 2003 to grant foreigners the right to vote. As the right to vote and the right to stand for election are indivisible rights in the law of Vaud, foreigners are also allowed to stand for election at municipal level. Only Swiss citizens have the right to vote and stand for election at cantonal level.

== Zug ==
An amendment providing for the possibility for the communes of the [[Canton of Zug]] to grant foreigners the right to vote at municipal elections was presented in September 2006 during debates surrounding the amendment of the Law on political rights. However, this provision was not retained in the final version of the amended law.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Zurich ==
In 1993, the voters of the [[Canton of Zürich|Canton of Zurich]] voted against a popular initiative (by 74.5% of votes) proposing granting foreigners political rights in the canton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geneve.ch/grandconseil/memorial/data/540310/44/540310_44_partie3.asp|title=Session 540310 - Séance 44 - PL - 7913-A|website=www.geneve.ch|access-date=2016-03-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308034302/http://www.geneve.ch/grandconseil/memorial/data/540310/44/540310_44_partie3.asp |archivedate=2016-03-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual initiative launched by a citizen (“Einzelinitiative”) which proposed introducing voting rights for foreigners in municipal elections was rejected in February 2007.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A '''satiric misspelling''' is an intentional misspelling of a word, phrase or name for a [[rhetoric]]al purpose. This is often done by replacing a letter with another letter (for example, ''[[k]]'' replacing ''[[c]]''), or symbol (for example, ''[[$]]'' replacing ''[[s]]'', ''[[@]]'' replacing ''[[a]]'', or ''[[¢]]'' replacing ''c'').  Satiric misspelling is found particularly in [[Internet slang|informal writing on the Internet]], but can also be found in some serious political writing that opposes the [[status quo]].
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: Examples in this article should be cited in the style described at [[WP:CITE#HOW]] whenever possible, instead of simply providing an external link. --&gt;

== ''K'' replacing ''c'' ==
Replacing the letter ''c'' with ''k'' in the first letter of a word came into use by the [[Ku Klux Klan]] during its early years in the mid-to-late 19th century. The concept is continued today within the group.

[[File:Barc okupa.jpg|thumb|Barcelona squat and anarchist centre, labelled "OKUPA Y RESISTE"]]
In the 1960s and early 1970s in the [[United States]], [[left-wing politics|leftists]], particularly the [[Yippies]], sometimes used ''[[Amerika (disambiguation)|Amerika]]'' rather than ''America'' in referring to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schwarzreport.org/Newsletters/1969/november15,69.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123223245/http://www.schwarzreport.org/Newsletters/1969/november15%2C69.htm |title=CACC NEWSLETTER |archivedate=January 23, 2008 |work=schwarzreport.org |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hippy.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=81|title=A Call to Arms (1969?) -  Hippy Land, Home of the Hippies|work=hippy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://riseup.net/sds/graphics.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050726012713/http://riseup.net/sds/graphics.htm |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine|archivedate=July 26, 2005 |work=riseup.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/sixties/radical.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.american.edu/bgriff/H207web/sixties/rubinchildofAmerika.htm|title=Jerry Rubin: Self-Portrait of a Child of "Amerika," 1970|work=american.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still used as a political statement today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jasonalexandercruz.com/|title=Nachrichten aus der Musik- und Entertainmentbranche -  Jasonalexandercruz.com|work=jasonalexandercruz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/guinnessgurl/sets/148438/|title=political|work=Flickr}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that this was originally an allusion to the [[German language|German]] spelling of the word, and intended to be suggestive of [[Nazism]], a hypothesis that the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' supports.

In broader usage, the replacement of the letter ''c'' with ''k'' denotes general political skepticism about the topic at hand and is intended to discredit or debase the term in which the replacement occurs.&lt;ref name="LeSaint's Sloth Cave"&gt;{{cite web|title=LeSaint's Sloth Cave|url=http://www.le-saint.com/wear.html|accessdate=29 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929121925/http://www.le-saint.com/wear.html |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar usage in [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Catalan Language|Catalan]] and [[Portuguese Language|Portuguese]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} is to write ''okupa'' rather than ''ocupa'' (often on a building or area occupied by [[squatter]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comunidades.calle22.com/comunidades/397/com397con2.asp |title=comunidades.calle22.com - TODOS SOMOS OKUPAS |accessdate=2004-10-07 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611121504/http://comunidades.calle22.com/comunidades/397/com397con2.asp |archivedate=June 11, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the name adopted by ''okupación'' activist groups), which is particularly remarkable because the letter "k" is not part of the Spanish, Portuguese or Italian alphabets. It stems from a combination of English borrow words with k in them to those languages, and [[Anarchism in Spain|Spanish anarchist]] and [[Punk rock|punk]] movements which used "k" to signal rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rodríguez González|first=Félix|year=2006|title=Medios de comunicación y contracultura juvenil|work=Círculo|volume=25:5–30|url=http://www.ucm.es/info/circulo/no25/rodriguez.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Replacing "c" with "k" was at the centre of a [[Monty Python]] joke from the Travel Agent sketch. [[Eric Idle]] has an affliction that makes him pronounce the letter C as a B, as in "bolour" instead of "colour."  [[Michael Palin]] asks him if he can say the letter K?  Idle replies that he can, and Palin suggests that he spell words with a K instead of C.  Idle replies, "what, spell bolour with a K?  Kolour.  Oh!  I never thought of that before!  What a silly [[Cunt#Comedy|bunt]]!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transcript|url=http://web.mit.edu/humor/Special/Monty.Python/travel.agency|work=Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Index of Humor|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video game franchise [[Mortal Kombat]] is another example of this trend.

===''KKK'' replacing ''c'' or ''k''===
A common satiric usage of the letters ''KKK'' is the spelling of ''America'' as ''Amerikkka'', alluding to the [[Ku Klux Klan]], drawing to a perceived notion of an underlying or inherent [[Racism in the United States|racism]] in American society. The earliest known usage of ''Amerikkka'' recorded in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' is in 1970, in a journal called ''Black World''. Presumably, this was an extrapolation from the then already widespread ''Amerika''.{{Clarify|date=December 2014}}{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The spelling ''Amerikkka'' came into greater use after the 1990 release of the [[gangsta rap]] album ''[[AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted]]'' by [[Ice Cube]], also used by rapper [[Spice 1]] for his album ''[[AmeriKKKa's Nightmare]]'' and by [[shock rock]] band [[Undercover Slut]] for their album ''Amerikkka Macht Frei''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The letters ''KKK'' have been inserted into several other words and names, to indicate similar perceived racism, oppression or corruption. Examples include:

== @ replacing A, at or O&lt;span id="@replacing"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- linked from "At sign" --&gt;==
Since at least 1980, people have used the "at sign" ("[[@]]") as a representation of the [[Anarchy a|circled letter A]]. This has been extended to substituting it for the letter "A" as in the [[Crass]] [[fanzine]] ''Toxic Gr@fity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/1980.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206073619/http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/1980.html|archivedate=December 6, 2010|deadurl=yes|title=Crass Discography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spanish, it became informally common (but not accepted by the [[Real Academia Espanola|RAE]], due to @ being a symbol and not a letter) to use @ in place of "o/a" to denote both genders.  For example, "señorit@" can be used to mean "señorita and/or señorito" instead of using "señorita/o."

==Word-in-word==
Occasionally a word written in its orthodox spelling is altered with internal capital letters, hyphens, italics, or other devices so as to highlight a fortuitous pun. Some examples:
* After the controversial [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 U.S. Presidential elections]], the alleged improprieties of the election prompted the use of such titles as "pResident" and "(p)resident"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20010326&amp;s=contest |archive-url=https://archive.is/20060530225708/http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20010326&amp;s=contest |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 30, 2006 |title=Name the President! |date=March 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gainesvillehumanists.org/alerts.htm |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=May 14, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041013030443/http://www.gainesvillehumanists.org/alerts.htm |archivedate=October 13, 2004 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[George W. Bush]]. The same effects were also used for [[Bill Clinton]] during and after Clinton's impeachment hearings. These devices were intended to suggest that the president was merely the ''resident'' of the [[White House]] rather than the legitimate leader.
* Similarly, the controversial [[United States]] law, the ''[[USA PATRIOT Act]]'', is sometimes called the "patRiot Act", "(pat)Riot Act", "PAT Riot Act", "PAT RIOT Act", or "You Sap At Riot Act"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stallman.org/pat-riot-act.html |title=PAT RIOT Act - Richard Stallman |publisher=Stallman.org |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=115660&amp;cid=9794643 |title=Slashdot Comments &amp;#124; British Columbia Acts Against Patriot Act |publisher=Yro.slashdot.org |date=July 25, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by its opponents.

Along the same lines, intentional misspellings can be used to promote a specific negative attribute, real or perceived, of a product or service. This is especially effective if the misspelling is done by replacing part of the word with another that has identical phonetic qualities.

Some [[toponyms|place names]] are also spelled differently in order to emphasize some political view. For instance, ''Brasil'' (the Portuguese spelling of "Brazil"), is sometimes misconstrued as a typo for ''Brazil'' in English texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definition/brasil |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927190200/http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definition/brasil |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the English spelling ''Brazil'' is used in Portuguese pieces of text as a way to denote [[anti-Americanism]] or [[Anti-globalization|anti-globalization sentiment]].

Journalists may make a politicized editorial decision by choosing to differentially retain (or even create) misspellings, mispronunciations, ungrammaticisms, dialect variants, or interjections.

'''''Security, Territory, Population''''' is a part of [[Foucault's lectures at the Collège de France|a lecture series]] given by French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] at the [[Collège de France]] between 1977 and 1978 and published posthumously based on audio recordings. In it, Foucault examines the notion of [[biopolitics]] as a new technology of power over populations that is distinct from punitive disciplinary systems, by tracing the history of [[governmentality]], from the first centuries of the Christian era to the emergence of the modern nation state. These lectures illustrate a radical turning point in Foucault's work in which a shift to the problematic of the government of self and others occurred.

== Territory ==
Foucault tries to trace the 'government of things' in relation to modern society, starting with [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] ''[[The Prince]]'' and its reception&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 87-114 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-Machiavellian literature wanted to replace the ability of the prince to hold on to his principality with something entirely new: an art of government.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 92-109 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault then notices that this art of government was internal to society itself, not external, this type of self-government was practiced rit throughout European society; such as Italy, Germany, France, etc. which was seized upon by the modern nation state from which it took up as its central practices. This is from as early as the 16th century which in due course enabled the elimination of the [[sovereignty|sovereign]] prince as a transcendental, singularity figure of Machiavelli's prince.

All of society was enmeshed within this process including the prince (ruler) himself, thus a century later government became political and collaborative with economy (modern [[political science]] as its 'rational' spokesman) and its partnership with [[political economy]]. Foucault further notices that political economy had a new tool called statistics founded by the [[Physiocrats]] economists&lt;ref&gt;Foucault makes mention the infamous group for this 'scientific state apparatus' the [[Physiocrats]] ''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 33-49 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foucault mentions an important figure from this period which, according to Foucault was highly influential a Physiocrat economist [[Louis Paul Abeille]] Security, Territory, Population p. 30 pp. 50-52; see notes n. 1 p. 50, n. 17, p. 52 2007&lt;/ref&gt; (another term for scientific government) and it is with [[François Quesnay]] that this process can be found the very notion of economic government. So, according to a text quoted by Foucault written by [[Guillaume de La Perrière]] "government is the right disposition of things arranged so as to lead a suitable end."&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 96 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Political means the institutions that are governing the rest of society; government covered by legal institutions which gives both the political electorate, political executive and political legitimacy,&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 135-161 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 142-149 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault traces this practice to the ancient Greek text from the [[Pythagoreans]] known as ''nomas'' (meaning the law) and according to this text the shepherd is the lawmaker, he directs the flock, indicates the right direction and says how the sheep must mate to have good offspring.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 137-140 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault then reads into [[Robert Castel]]'s work; ''The Psychiatric Order'', an essential read according to Foucault, where the techniques were finally finalised during the 18th century of this absolute global project which was directed towards the whole of society.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 117-119 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 10-14 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Which was public hygiene and a whole battery of other techniques were used concerning the education of children, assistance to the poor, and through the psychiatric order, the institution of workers tutelage was coordinated through psychiatric practices. These technologies of power, Foucault claims, were introduced into the 18th century emerging prison system which migrated into the modern surveillance society through the infamous system that [[Jeremy Bentham]] tried to introduce, the [[Panopticon]];&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 117, p. 131; see notes 7 and 8 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; the modern internal and external surveillance system that modern society inhabits 'self watch' and 'self government'.

Accomplishing the unintended axiomatic affect of unaccountability, while the full focal point of a ruler is often presented unchallenged to the populace as a system of unimaginable alterations, self-perpetuating and self regularity (among those who inhabit the system), where clearly defined roles are defined and repeated right throughout the system(through norms).&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 11-13 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The system can readjust itself to whatever is thrown at it (an internal firewall integral to the system where the dangerous individual can be spotted and isolated at will). This was accomplished, according to Foucault, (rather paradoxically) from power relations elsewhere from other institutions in order to analyse them from the point of view of other technologies to free them elsewhere to form new systematic institutions as new knowledge objects. Foucault traces this original practice to government practices of the Middle Ages, where the term government meant an entirely different definition as modern society knows it. For example, 'enough wheat to govern Paris for two years', this covers a wide semantic view, it also refers to control of one's body, soul and behaviour, conduct, diet, the care given to an individual. Which Foucault very often refers to as 'governmentality', self conduct or self-government. Foucault traces this tactic back through history to the east (Mediterranean East, Egypt, Assyrian Empire, Babylonian etc.) which was specific to those societies. In Foucault own words this very aspect of Foucault's own work is still a work in progress, and is not a finalised research. However, Foucault situates this type of pastoral power squarely onto the new founded Christian Church where an organized religion ruled an entire society politically for 1500 years. And what was produced or outcome of all this turbulence was constant battles of supremacy for this type of pastoral power, government over men and their souls.

The Church rapidly colonized this type of new power between 11th and 18th century, and according to Foucault, the church laid claim to the daily government of men in their real lives on the grounds of their salvation and no example of this exist anywhere in history of societies.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 191-226 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 227-253 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 232-253 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Foucault research goes on to show that all the religious struggles from this period were fundamentally struggles over who would actually have the right to govern men, and to govern men in their daily lives they were practically struggles over who had the right to this power. Foucault then derives from this that from the 11th to the 18th century all the struggles of religion (wars of religion) were fundamentally struggles over who would actually have the right to govern men, and to govern men in their daily lives and in details and materiality of their existence; they were struggles over who has this power, from whom it derives, how it is exercised, the margin of autonomy for each, the qualification of those who exercise it, the limits of their jurisdiction, what recourse is possible against them, and what control is exercised over each. The [[Protestant Reformation]] traversed this relationship of pastorate power and what resulted from the reformation, although an historical event, was a formidable reinforcement of the pastorate system of religious power (political power in modern societies).

This type of religious power (pastoral power) was simply a reorganization of pastoral power from within, but, however, this type of reorganization of pastoral power encroached on the sovereigns (ruler) political power at the same time, it was not a smooth transition as is often portrayed. This led to a succession of tumultuous upheavals and revolts over this period, 11th-18th century; [[Norman Conquest]], [[English Civil War]], [[The Anarchy]], [[Hundred Years' War]], [[Crusades]], [[Peasants' Revolt]], [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages]], [[popular revolt in late medieval Europe]]. All of which are well attested too, Foucault refers to these revolts as revolts against conduct, the most radical of which were the Protestant reformation. Foucault then concludes that this political process can be traced to the general context of resistances, revolts and great insurrections of conduct (Peasants' Revolt of 1524-1526 for example).

== Raison d'État (reason of State) ==
Foucault concludes that these insurrections of conduct push started the transition of the pastoral of souls to the political government of men and the revolts, insurrections of conduct and resistances should be seen in this context. The new economic and consequently the political relations which the old feudal structures were unable to manage and lacked any effective framework, with which they were unable to cope. Foucault notices that the pastorate community were swamped with everyday life of individuals where it took charge of a whole series of questions and problem concerning material life, property, education of children. This led to an re-emergence of philosophy as the answer to the fundamental question of everyday life, in relation to others, in relation to those in authority, to the sovereign, or the feudal lord, and in order to direct one's mind as well, and to direct it in the right direction, to its salvation, certainly, but also to the truth.

Philosophy took over from this period; on the religious function of how to conduct oneself as a result of taking a form that was not specially religious or ecclesiastical. With the advent of the 16th century western society enter the age of forms of conducting, directing, and government. Foucault then considers these great upheavals of [[Medieval Europe]] as nothing else but the translation of the continuum from god to men, political institutions and the political order. Which was broken by all the upheaval that Europe had suffered. This produced a series of conflicts among those who tried to define sovereignty (not political sovereignty as we know it) but the art of government, ''principia naturae'' (reason of government) which brought in the political philosophy doctrine, known as [[raison d'État]] (reason of state).&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 1-25 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 16th century, Western society begins to define itself as territorial and expansionary with means of security as its primary focus.

Foucault reads into this that the philosophy of raison d'État having found its way into Europe through the [[Peace of Westphalia]]&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 285-310 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; (known as the [[Balance of power (international relations)|Balance of power]] in modern thought);&lt;ref&gt;Foucault mentions the term as it was known then, Balance of Europe; however, the word 'Europe' was an entirely new concept in 17th century Europe, it had no basis nor meaning to thinkers of political thought from this period but the term balance of Europe and whose chief political architect and origin of the term can be found in the works of [[Francesco Guicciardini]]. The other 'scientific' proponent of the idea of balance of Europe can be found in the works of none other than mathematician [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] "What is the balance of Europe?It is the idea of a political-military physics in which variable antagonistic forces are exercised in terms of random violent clashes of some with others, of some against others. The balance of Europe is not a problem of statics, but of dynamics." ''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 297-310 p. 308, notes 14, 16 for Guicciardini 2007&lt;/ref&gt; this can be found in the works of Italian political philosopher [[Giovanni Botero]]&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 237-240 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; where Botero concluded that the state is a firm domination over peoples and to keep hold of its preservation one was expected to have knowledge of the appropriate means for founding preserving, and expanding such a domination.

This political philosophy of raison d'État was made as the chief political philosophy (with its accompanied rationality) in mainland Europe. Foucault's analysis of raison d'État (here [[Bogislaw Philipp von Chemnitz]] son of [[Martin von Chemnitz]]) writing under the pseudonym ''[[Hippolithus a Lapide]]'' first starts to query the first uses of the doctrine of raison d'État at the Treaty of Westphalia, where among the diplomatic community the doctrine starts to become popular for discussion&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 240-248, pp. 250-252, notes, 24-25 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;) offers interesting conclusions of this new type of power the transition of the government of souls to the government of men. This first takes place between 13th century and the 18th century, from the 16th century the subject starts to appear of an idea of perpetual peace taken from the Middle Ages idea. Which primarily belonged to the church, from the 16th century therefore, exists the idea of a 'balance of power', with few exceptions, this idea became problematic, it started or rather had to included the populace.

The solution to this problematic situation was the inclusion, within the philosophy of raison d'État, the incorporation of the populace which the machinery of the state had to govern. The government of men as Foucault refers to it, directly from the pastorate community to the transfer to the political community. Foucault then further shows that raison d'État was not much concerned with legality (as we know the term) but with political necessity; politics is concerned with necessity and if necessary politics must become violent lending to [[coup d'état]]; this means that it is obliged to sacrifice, to sever, cause harm, and it is led to be unjust and murderous. This produced a whole series of problematic solutions to this problem, of which the population became of primary concern, coup d'état&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 260-267 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 277-278 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; politics isn't the practice as we know it today. Under the auspices of the [[Renaissance]] was not primarily concerned with legitimacy, but survival of the state.

Foucault then tries to show only when the problem of population and security starts taking effect amongst the different practices that the consideration of population becomes a worry. Foucault then notices a point of departure pointing out the idea of sedition and revolt starts to enter texts, but 'the people' proved elusive to define all around Europe, and never entered popular discussion, at first point of juncture was the privileged titled nobles appointed and rewarded through the honours system created by the monarch and sanctioned through the legal system of the day; the entire [[Nobility]] knight's, barons, dukes, earl's and their rivals began to become seen and known as 'the people'.&lt;ref&gt;"The people were too hard for the King in property; and then in arms too hard for him. We must either lay the foundation in property, or else it will not stand. Property, generally, is now with the people; the government, therefore, must be there." ''Thomas Burton Diary Volume 3'' pp. 146-148, note 36 1658-1659&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"All government is built upon propriety, else the poor must rule it. All nations are so. Let us therefore consider things before persons. Government is built upon propriety, therefore lands, leases, or goods, should be represented, rather than the people."Quoted from Captain Baynes in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] in ''Thomas Burton Diary Volume 3'' pp. 146-148, note 36 1658-1659&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;A certain Mr. Neville refers to the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] brought in by [[Henry VIII]] and parliament by the authority and power given to the monarch of the day by the [[Act of Supremacy]] passed by parliament under Henry VIII which brought the first ensemble apparatus of what would later become known as the Welfare state 350 years later Quoted From ''Thomas Burton Diary Of Parliamentary Debate Volume 3 '' pp. 132-134 1658-1659&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"I wonder what is the necessity for this previous vote. We are returned to the law of nature. It is said in the Bill the people have all acknowledged him. I thought the people had been only here. Either he is so, or he is not so. If so, there is no necessity for this House declaring him so. If not, there is need of some consideration. The Bill makes it hereditary. Where it speaks of successor, it mentions nothing of the Petition and Advice. It is fit you should be satisfied whether he be so. It should be made out. It makes him Supreme Magistrate, and gives him as great a power as ever King of England had. I would know what the words mean, if it give him not the executive and legislative power as fully as any King. Consider whether you do not put yourselves out of a capacity of recalling your liberties, by this step. First, you settle a monarch; one estate before the other two" Quoted from Captain Baynes Baynes refers to the 'people' in terms only limited to those 'elected' "that out of the 658 members sent to the House, only 171 were sent by the people. In 1794, "the majority of the House of Commons," for England and Wales, was computed to be "chosen by less than eight thousand, out of eight millions" which comprises less than 00.001% of the 'people' to the House of commons; see note 38 taken from ''Thomas Burton Diary Of Parliamentary Debate Volume 3'' pp. 145-150&lt;/ref&gt;

== Population ==
Foucault considers the breakthrough of "this governmental reasoning" of the population as a substantial event in Western history and society comparable to the [[scientific revolution]] of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 285-286 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Where a substantial transfer of techniques and technologies were transferred from the sovereign individual (the monarch) to a new modified apparatus known as the [[Disciplinary institutions]], of the 18th century and its scientific representatives [[Carceral archipelago]], ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' (all in the space of 80 years Foucault's notices) which culminated into a new version known as [[nation state]]s. This change took place in the 16th century and continued right through into the 19th century. Foucault then gives examples of this procedure through the system known as ''[[raison d'État]]'', from this analytical view of the state by [[Claude Fleury]],&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 323-324 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 331, notes 31, 32, 34, 38 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; war, raising finance, justice; there must be an abundance of men (large scale phenomena of population).

It is not the absolute number of the population that counts, but its relationship with the set composition of forces: the size of the territory, natural resources, wealth, commercial activities and so on. From Fleury's point of view, according to Foucault, the more there are of men, the stronger the state and the prince will be. So, according to Fleury, it is not expanse of land (expansion of the territory) that contributes greatness of the state but fertility and the number of men. Foucault then introduces into his [[Ontogenetic]] and, [[Phylogenetic]] investigations the concept of '[[police]]' (see also [[miasma theory of disease]]); not the police of the [[criminal justice system]] as we know it today, but as concept known at that time as urbanisation of the territory and administrative concern; which means making the kingdom, the entire territory into a large industrious town. Foucault then considers how [[Mercantilism]] played a big role in this new context of European balance of power; these are the mercantilist requirements: every country should try to have the largest possible population, second; the entire population be eligible for working and be able to be put to work, third; wages given to the population be as low as possible, fourth; the cost price of goods at the lowest price as possible. Police according to Foucault consists of a sovereign exercise of royal power over individuals who are therefore subjects.

The actual police is the direct governmentality of the sovereign who rules through raison d'État. What Foucault means by the governmentality of the sovereign is the mind of the police runs through all of the populations, collective consciousness therefore, reducing criminality not its complete elimination, for political and economic reasons (see ''[[Discipline and Punish]]''), not through fear, but the knowledge of the police as a system with its own structural objective as laws, judicial, legislative operating as a microcosm of the societal body, which ultimately represents the sovereigns will. Initially, however, this was not the sole intention of the police as we know it where Foucault introduces the original founder of the system now known to us as the police, [[Nicolas Delamare|Nicolas Delamare (1639-1723)]]&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas Delamare 1639-1723 Delamare served as Superintendent at Chatelet from 1673 to 1710 under the lieutenancy of La Reynie this is Foucault's only mention of La Reynie in his lectures for more information on Delamare see ''Security, Territory, Population'' the following notes p. 53 n. 26, pp. 359-360 n. 1-9 2007&lt;/ref&gt; (Foucault doesn’t mention the real founder of the police [[Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie]]).

Foucault concentrates on how the police became an integral feature and intermingled with population, tracing the system on its foundation on how this is arranged around the composition of forces which the whole Western system of the balance of power, raison E’tat was organised and arranged around. This system consisted of an organised scientifically trained professional army,(as opposed to a private army organised around the service of the king) incorporated within this military system is [[Thantopolitics]]([[Political power]] used through the military system for the purposes of warfare by other means) for the purposes of the slaughtering of millions of people if necessary,on an industrial scale,&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 285-310 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 299, pp. 304-306, p. 307, notes 9-19 2007&lt;/ref&gt; a system of legitimacy, comprising the sovereign, not the sovereign as a singular ruler but as an organised superstructure institution(modern government) comprising societal state functions, [[Political sovereignty]] which guaranteed the sovereign's legitimacy, judiciary, legislator, [[Parliamentary]] system; political power, political executive, political elite, and a political communication system while not offered any considerable attention by some Social scientist and historians nevertheless,these techniques do indeed exist,where it is admitted as such by those actual professional technicians(one such technique used is known professionally as the [[Sabido method]] pioneered by [[Miguel Sabido]] derived from the field of [[entertainment-education]])and the political arm of this technique simply known as [[Demagogue]] who are involved in the operation of these techniques of deception and persuasion and a whole group of professional manipulators are needed which is primarily aimed at the entire worldwide television audience and political community.&lt;ref&gt;"Since The Arrival of mass communication,a particular kind of image making has grown into a central feature of the political processes of Western democracies.The book will argue that a core feature of mass democratic politics is ''hype making''.Just as magicians smoke-and mirrors-to distract their audidences and conjure up illusions so too does the political machine and its media staffers.In today's Western democracies,television is the primary(but not exclusive)vehicle for this smoke-and-mirrors show.This show involves four sets of players:politicians-as-performers;the spin industry;media workers(journalists,presenters/hosts and researchers);and their audiencies. A fifth set of players are policy makers-but they tend to remain back stage;shielded from as much scrutiny as possible by the smoke and mirriors show.A core aim of this book is to unravel the symbiotic relationships between journalists,and spin doctors and politicians within contemporary televisualized politics.The book will argue that Demagoguery has become a core feature 20th century Western politics,with politics now characterized by a range of demagogic arts geared to steering mass public opinion.These demagogic arts will be described and analyzed." Eric Louwe ''The Media and Political Process'' 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David O Poindexter]] ''Out Of The Darkness Of Centuries:A 45 Year Odyssey To Discover The Use Of Mass Media For Human Betterment'' 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Halisbury Laws Of England Volume 34 Parliament 4th Edition 1984''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Indeed, techniques of deception have undergone enormous improvements since Orwell's time. Many of these techniques were developed in connection with the advertising and marketing of commercial products and services, and then adapted to politics. Their distinguishing feature is that they can be bought for money. More recently, cognitive science has helped to make the techniques of deception even more effective, giving rise to political professionals who concentrate only on "getting results"

These professionals take pride in their accomplishments, and may even enjoy the respect of an American public that admires success no matter how it is achieved. That fact casts doubt on Karl Popper's concept of an open society, which is based on the recognition that, while perfect knowledge is unattainable, we can gain a better understanding of reality by engaging in critical thinking.

Popper failed to recognise that in democratic politics, gathering public support takes precedence over the pursuit of truth. In other areas, such as science and industry, the impulse to impose one's views on the world encounters the resistance of external reality. But in politics the electorate's perception of reality can be easily manipulated. As a result, political discourse, even in democratic societies, does not necessarily lead to a better understanding of reality.

The reason democratic politics leads to manipulation is that politicians do not aspire to tell the truth. They want to win elections, and the best way to do that is to skew reality to their own benefit."

And finally, the final piece in the jigsaw puzzle; the western political system of [[consent of the governed]]. This system at least gives the rationale of why it was necessary to have on board a widely disparate atomized populace; and its use, through the not widely known and little understood function of the [[Royal Prerogative]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/docs/royal-prerogative.pdf|format=PDF|title=Review of the Executive Royal Prerogative Powers 2010|publisher=Justice.gov.uk|accessdate=29 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20091111115352/http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/docs/royal-prerogative.pdf|archivedate=11 November 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmselect/cmpubadm/422/422.pdf |format=PDF|title=Taming the Prerogative: Strengthening Ministerial Accountability to Parliament 2004|publisher=Publications.parliament.uk|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foucault doesn't use the phrase [[Royal Prerogative]] but uses the term 'Royal power' ''The Birth Of Biopolitics'' pp. 7-9, p. 37 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of which can be traced back to the Middle Ages from where the western system of political power gets its central idea, from the point of view and simple justification of consent of the governed, legitimacy and political power. This legitimacy, which is exercised through the use of Parliamentary democracy(see also [[Greek government debt crisis]], [[National unity government]], [[European sovereign debt crisis]]), was essential to the western system of political power and modern government;"The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government","The people" identifies the entire body of the citizens of a jurisdiction invested with political power or gathered for political purposes'" or "Popular sovereignty or the sovereignty of the people is the political principle that the legitimacy of the state is created by the will or consent of its people, who are the source of all political power".

All of this Foucault calls the political technology of biopower. This had to have the entire population on board in terms of ‘the police’, which had an entirely different meaning from what we know it today by tracing the concept back through time from the 15th century and 16th century usage, previous thinkers meant the term as a community association governed by a public authority and political power with accountability to a public authority. By quoting [[Johann Heinrich Gottlob Justi]] “of laws and regulations that concern the interior of a state and which endeavors to strengthen and increase the power of this state and make good use of its forces".&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 314-315 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population''; see note 8 pp. 329-330 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

What Foucault reveals is that the original police had a different function as we know it today; for example one of their primary function was to administer the state in the guise of statisticians, allocating resources, supervision of grain in times of crisis, ensuring circulation of goods and men, secure the development of the state's forces.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 311-332 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; This was so successful this then led to an extension of the franchising out in the form of recruitment of the then [[University]] system. This bought in the next generation of administrators for the new ‘nation state’ system. This bought in two types of police; administrators who formed the [[Polizeiwissenschaft]]; the science of police or the science of government of the state, the other type would become known as what we know and associate the term today [[criminal justice system]], [[Law enforcement]], [[Forensic science]] and the modern uniformed police [[Polizeistaat]] police state, translated into English as policing of the state.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 318-319 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 330; see note 14 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally from Germany, this system spread right throughout Europe from the middle of the 17th century and most crucially, this Polizeiwissenschaft grow a substantial bibliography of this system ‘science of police’ by the 19th century. Foucault's research shows that some 4000 different pamphlets and articles had emerged from 1520-1850 under the titles of “science of police in the broad sense” and “science of the police in the strict sense”.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 318 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Security, Territory, Population p. 330; see note 11 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; This became known as [[Cameral]] science(the new modern [[Public administration]]). The future administrators for the future modern nation state system with many functions; such as [[bureaucrats]], [[civil servants]], [[Think tanks]], [[public policy]] makers, [[economists]] all from the university system.

== Obedience ==
For Foucault obedience was a vital mechanism of salvation of the government, not in the form of blind loyalty, but in the form of political salvation of the state(see [[Oath of Allegiance (United Kingdom)|Oath of Allegiance]] for example). This led to political theorists of the day juxtaposing theories concerning state, government, body politics, and political power; these theorists dare not call these laws divine or God-made law, but instead refer to them as 'philosophical'. As in [[Gabriel Naudé]],&lt;ref&gt;Security, Territory, Population p. 252, note 40 2007&lt;/ref&gt; an agent of Richelieu's, where he refers to the salvation of the state "The coup d'état does not comply with natural, universal noble and philosophical, it complies with an artificial, particular, political justice concerning the necessity of the state&lt;ref&gt;Security, Territory, Population pp. 260-261, p. 263, pp. 280-281, notes 20-21, 24-25, 26 2007&lt;/ref&gt;". For Foucault, politics is not above this process which it cannot be afforded, therefore, is not something that has to fall within a remit of legality or a system of laws. Politics, according to Foucault's use of the term, is concerned with necessity, necessity of the state which puts to an end to all privileges in order to make itself obeyed by everyone. So you do not have government connected with legality, but raison d'État connected with necessity.

Foucault then touches briefly on the theatrical practice of raison d'État and its prevalence over legitimacy. Which would be rather ironical as this is the main problem of theatrical practice in politics, which was in reality the practice of raison d'État. The theatre where this is played out in the form of dramatization and a constant mode of manifestation of the state and the sovereign as the holder of state power. Thus, for Foucault analysis this contrasts differently with and in opposition to traditional ceremonies of royalty which from anointment to coronation up to the entry into towns or major cities or iconic, famous funerals of infamous monarchs, this marked the religious association of the sovereign, or at least the sovereign's alliance with the character and association with religious power and theology. This, Foucault notices was [[William Shakespeare]]'s main intention where the political representation (modern representation of this is media visual representation of political power, political consultants, image makers (media consultants), and 'power politics' and its constant fixation with voting and leading political personalities) of the sovereign [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] for example was a part of historical drama, although based on real people and events, but for all intents and purposes was political representation in the form of plots, intrigues, disgraces, preferences, exclusions, good guys and bad guys and political exiles, where the theatre represents the state itself.

Foucault now turns his attention to obedience and the population and why this was a problem among political theorists of the times. He then produces [[Francis Bacon]]'s text "Of Seditions and Troubles". In this essay Bacon gives a complete description on the physics of sedition, sedition and the precautions to be taken against it, and of government of the 'people'. This became a worry for Bacon and other political theorists; the first signs of sedition were circulation of libels, pamphlets and discourse against the state and those who govern. Second, Bacon notices the reversal of values or evaluations which puts the existence at risk. Weakness in the chain of command. Foucault reads into Bacon the theory of revolt of the people and there are two categories of individuals within the state, the common people (very often referred in text as [[Peasants]], the [[People]], the [[Common people]], the poor, or at times [[Vagabond (person)|Vagabond]] vagrants) and the nobility, what differentiates the common people and the nobility is their unshared interest.

They do not have any common interest between the two groups in Bacon's view the common people are too slow to engage in revolt and sedition. But if the common people and the nobility ever unite and become one unit they represent a threat to the sovereign's rule. A slow people and a weak nobility (because of their small number) mean that sedition can be prevented and discontents stopped from contaminating each other. Bacon then views the process of the danger of sedition where you can either buy the nobility or you can execute them.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 267-275 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of the common people becomes a different matter, they are not easily bought. So Bacon himself offers a whole series of measures and reforms that should be implemented, reducing the rate of interest, avoiding excessively large estates, increased wages, promoting external trade increasing the value of raw materials through work, and assuring provisions of transport to foreign countries.

While the differences between Bacon and Machiavelli appear subtle, it was 250 years later that the political model of reforms changed, why? Foucault was not much interested into the notion of reform as 'cure', but what was behind the underlying mechanism that was driving the system of reform ensuring reforms become a permanent feature of 'failure'. Foucault begins to trace through this development through the political model of reform and one crucial development was the economy, a politics of economic calculation with Mercantilism and for Foucault this was not just a theory but was above all else a political practice. The invention of the political campaign which Foucault traces back through its original modern founder, [[Cardinal Richelieu]], who according to Foucault actually invented the modern political campaign by means of lampoons and pamphlets and more importantly, invented those professional manipulators of opinion who were called at the time ''[[publiciste]]s''.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 255-283 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 283, notes 59, 60 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, for Foucault raison d'État must always act on the collective consciousness of the population, not only to impose some true or false belief on them, as when, for example, sovereigns want to create belief in their own legitimacy or in illegitimacy of their rivals, but in such away that the collective opinion can be modified along with their behaviour as economic and political subjects. The main function of public opinion is to produce a politics of believable truth within raison d'État.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 272-283. (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The most obvious example of all this is that propaganda, in its political sense has a twofold objective: 1, The main function of public opinion is to produce an emergence, alliance between political propaganda and a belief system of politics of truth within collective consciousness, a version of political continuity within raison d’Etat, this practice of political reform, while ensuring that the essential features of the system remain intact, gets passed on to future generations ensuring failure.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 272-283.(2007)&lt;/ref&gt; 2, The other main political purposes of propaganda is to make sure that the chaos of modern living becomes accepted as the norm therefore, rendering whole swathes of society useless (through cultural practices), in its objectives to do anything about it. You can do something about it, but only within the rules of a political tool, even within the confines of political buffoons who appear to have no hold or control of the system that they are in charge of.

This political tool is soiled and rigged against those who use it and cannot be used for practical change but its power comes from those who gives comfort to those who use it in the hope of a false belief of change can happen leaving the practicalities of the system as ‘real’ events. This, Foucault notices produced two consensus correlations namely; birth of economists, birth of the ‘’publicistes’’ known as economy and public opinion the two correlative elements of field of reality that is emerging as the direct correlate of government.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 255-283 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 163-185 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 191-226 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Salvation ==
[[Mercantilism]], according to Foucault, was the first rationalization of the exercise of power as a practice of government; it is the first time that a knowledge of the state can be employed as tactics for the state, namely statistics. Foucault begins to chart through this historical, political reasoning behind the doctrine [[raison d'État]] (reason of state). The time of the Middle Ages where the idea existed of an indefinite permanent character of political power and government. This perpetual discourse, the idea of progress in men's knowledge about themselves and towards others, however, one thing was internally missing from this analysis, namely the notion of population. Foucault traces the conceptual discourse of the populace back to the Middle Ages definition of the pastorate which to the Middle Ages mind meant salvation, obedience and truth. First of all the discourse of raison d'État and salvation; Foucault manages to trace conceptually the system of salvation through the 17th century usage of coup d'état politics. Foucault notices that entire treatise were devoted to the very notion of coup d'état, for example a text written in 1639 by [[Gabriel Naudé]], entitled ''Considerations sur les coups d'etat'' and writing in 1631 Foucault sites [[Jean Sirmond]] ''Le Coup d’Estat de Louis XIII''.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 255-283 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 280-281, notes 19, 20, 24, 26 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Split-ticket voting''' refers to when a voter in an election votes for candidates from different [[political party|political parties]] when multiple [[political office|offices]] are being decided by a single [[election]], as opposed to [[straight-ticket voting]], where a voter chooses candidates from the same political party for every office up for election.

==Australia==
In [[Australia]], federal elections in recent times have usually involved a [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] election and a [[Australian Senate|half-Senate]] election occurring on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/APF/monographs/Principle_and_Programatism/chapter1 "Party Voting and Partisan Decline in Australia", Maurice Rickard, Parliamentary Fellowship. Monograph], {{ISBN|978-0-9752015-5-8}}, Commonwealth of Australia, 2007  split-ticket voting = someone votes for different parties in the House of Representatives and in the Senate&lt;/ref&gt; Most states, with the exception of [[Queensland]] and [[Tasmania]],&lt;ref&gt;The Parliament of Queensland has only one house, while the Tasmanian Legislative Council is elected in staggered terms every May.&lt;/ref&gt; also hold elections for both houses of parliament simultaneously. An example of split-ticket voting in Australia is a voter who gives their first preference to the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] on the House of Representatives ballot paper and to the [[Family First Party|Family First]] party in the Senate.

In the [[Australian federal election, 2013|2013 election]], the Senate vote for both the Liberal and Labor parties was considerably lower than their lower house vote, demonstrating that a large number of people voted for a major party in the House of Representatives and a minor party or micro-party in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;http://results.aec.gov.au/17496/Website/Default.htm&lt;/ref&gt; There are many reasons why a voter may do this, including the fact that many parties only stand candidates for the Senate (leaving their supporters unable to vote for them on their lower house ballot), the much lower quota required for election to the Senate compared to the House of Representatives (14.3% versus 50%), and a desire to check the power of the government by preventing it from controlling the Senate.

From 1978 to 2008, when the [[Australian Democrats]] held representation in the Senate, the Democrats benefited greatly from split-ticket voting, as their Senate vote was always much higher than their House of Representatives vote.&lt;ref&gt;Sharman, C 1999, 'The representation of small parties and independents in the Senate', Australian Journal of Political Science, vol. 34, no. 3, pp. 353-361.&lt;/ref&gt; The party built its campaigns around "keeping the bastards honest", a reference to holding the [[separation of powers|balance of power]] in the Senate so as to prevent the chamber from becoming either a rubber stamp for the government or a tool of obstruction for the opposition.

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]] the [[Additional Member System]] is used for the [[devolution|devolved]] assemblies of [[Scottish Parliament|Scotland]] and [[Welsh Assembly|Wales]], as well as the [[London Assembly]]&lt;ref name="Additional-member system: Politics"&gt;{{cite web |title=Additional-member system: Politics|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/additional-member-system|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate= 24 Mar 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Elections in Wales"&gt;{{cite web |title=Elections in Wales |url=http://blogs.cardiff.ac.uk/electionsinwales/2013/11/05/electoral-systems-in-wales-3-ams/|publisher=[[Cardiff University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Electoral Reform and Voting Systems"&gt;{{cite web |title=Electoral Reform and Voting Systems |url=http://www.politics.co.uk/reference/electoral-reform-and-voting-systems|publisher=Politics.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered to increase the likelihood to split-ticket. As each voter casts two votes: one vote for a candidate standing in their constituency (with or [[independent candidate|without]] an affiliated party), and one vote for a [[party list]] standing in a wider region. In the constituency vote a single representative is elected using the traditional [[First-Past-The-Post]] system. The regional vote is used to elect multiple representatives from party lists to stand in regional seats, taking into account how many seats were gained by that party in the constituency vote, using a system of [[proportional representation]]: the number of seats a party receives will roughly reflect its percentage of the vote. Between the 1997 and 2003 elections in London, Scotland, and Wales between 17 and 28 percent of voters split their tickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The governance of Britain: review of voting systems, the experience of new voting systems in the United Kingdom since 1997|year=2008|author=[[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]]|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the [[United States]], multiple elections for many different offices are often held on the same day. This may be true of [[primary election]]s and may also include the placing of candidates for federal, state, and local offices on the same ballot. One of many possible examples of split-ticket voting in the United States is a voter who seeks to elect the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s candidate for the [[United States Senate|Senate]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]'s candidate for [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], the [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]]'s candidate for County Supervisor, and the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]]'s candidate for [[Coroner]].

One example is the 2004 elections in [[Montana]], where [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] gubernatorial candidate [[Brian Schweitzer]] was elected governor 50.4% to 46.0%, while incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] President [[George W. Bush]] defeated Democrat [[John Kerry]] 59% to 39%.  This suggests that a large number of the electorate voted for a split-ticket, selecting a Republican presidential candidate and a Democratic Party gubernatorial candidate. Another example is the [[West Virginia gubernatorial election, 2016]], in which Democrat (now Republican) [[Jim Justice]] won by 8 points while Republican presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]] won in the state with 68% of the vote.

However, Democratic candidates seeking governorships in [[red state]]s often hold somewhat more conservative views compared to those of a typical registered Democrat, whereas Republicans running for governor in [[blue state]]s often have more liberal views compared to those of an average Republican supporter elsewhere.  For example, [[Massachusetts]], despite being one of the most solidly Democratic states in national elections, elected Republican governors in 1990, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2014, and 2018.

==Motivations==
Although less common, split-ticket voting can potentially be used as a form of [[tactical voting]].  One possible example of this is a voter who prefers candidate A but does not believe that candidate A can win the election, so the voter votes for candidate B (who may be of a different political party from candidate A) because candidate B is better than other more competitive candidates C, D, etc.

Split-ticket voting may also occur in elections where multiple voting systems are employed.  One possible example of this is a voter who selects a candidate from a minority party for an office decided by a [[proportional representation]] election system and selects a candidate from a larger party for an office decided by a [[first past the post]] system.

Split-ticket voting in [[party list]] voting systems is called [[panachage]]; not all implementations allow it.

==Split ticket preferences==
Split ticket voting is different from split ticket preferencing, often referred to as a "split ticket".  In the latter, the candidate for political office (or the party they are standing for) will issue 'How to vote' cards or pamphlets which provide two different suggested alternatives on how voters who wish to vote for them should direct their second, third and subsequent preferences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qt.com.au/news/could-katter-win-blair-for-labor-split-ticket-coul/1997238/ "Could Katter win Blair for Labor?" Joel Gould The Queensland Times, 26 August 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/elections/federal/2004/guide/senatevotingsystem.htm "Antony Green's Election Guide", ABC, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.howtovote.com.au/index.html How to vote in Australian elections A guide to preferential voting in State and Federal elections]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''State collapse''', '''breakdown''', or '''downfall''' is the complete failure of a mode of [[government]] within a [[sovereign state]]. Sometimes this brings about a [[failed state]], as in Somalia and the [[Yugoslav Wars|final decade]] of [[Yugoslavia]].  More often, there is an immediate process of transition to a new administration, and basic services such as tax collection, defence, police, civil service, and courts are maintained throughout, as in [[South Africa]] following the failure of the [[Apartheid|apartheid system]].

State collapse may coincide with [[economic collapse]].  State collapse is not always synonymous with [[societal collapse]], which often is a more prolonged process, as in the fall of the western Roman Empire. 

Not all attempts at [[regime change]] succeed in bringing about state collapse.  The 16th-century [[Babington plot]] to assassinate [[Queen Elizabeth I]] of England, the 19th-century [[Decembrist revolt]] in Russia, and the 20th-century [[Bay of Pigs invasion]] of Cuba failed.

==History of the concept==
For [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC), the inherent dangers of democracy were, first, that conflict between the aristocracy and the poor was inevitable; and second, that it would usher in "mischief and corruption". Both processes would lead to collapse unless independent controls and [[separation of powers]] were enforced.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Przebowski, ''The Rise and Fall of the United States'', Ex Libris Corporation, 2009, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greek philosopher [[Polybius]] (c.200 – c.118 BC) asserted that all nations follow a cycle of; democracy, oligarchy, dictatorship, tyranny and collapse.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Przebowski]], ''The rise and fall of the United States, ExLibris Corporation'', 2009, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Islamic scholar [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332 – 1406) also produced a general theory of state collapse. A "theological rationalist", he transformed the study of history into a "new science".&lt;ref&gt;[[J.J. Saunders]], review of 'Ibn Khaldun's Philosophy of History' by [[Muhsin Mahdi]], [[History and Theory]] vol 5, no 3, (1966), pp. 322-347.&lt;/ref&gt; In his eyes, dynasties repeatedly become "sedentary, senile, coercive, pompous, subservient to desire ... liable to divisions in the dynasty." Group feeling ([[asabiyyah]], [[groupthink]]) disappears as the dynasty grows senile. Ibn Khaldun was fatalistic; "This senility is a chronic disease which cannot be cured because it is something natural".&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Khaldun, ''[[The Muqaddimah]]'' Routledge, 1978, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; He observed that dynasties last for three generations before a new invading clique, "restless, alert and courageous", will cause the old to collapse &lt;ref&gt;''The [[Muqaddimah]]'', Routledge, 1978, pp. 244-255.&lt;/ref&gt; in accordance with the principle in the [[Book of Exodus]], chapter 20, verse four: God "visits the sins of the fathers onto their children, even unto the third and fourth generation of those that hate Him". Professor [[Geoff Mulgan]] discusses Ibn Khaldun in detail and agrees on the timescale: "There are obvious parallels between the lifespans of individuals and those of ruling groups."&lt;ref&gt;Geoff Mulgan, ''Good and bad power'', Penguin, 2007, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J.J. Saunders]],&lt;ref&gt;[[J.J. Saunders]], review of 'Ibn Khaldun's Philosophy of History' by [[Muhsin Mahdi]], "[[History and Theory]]" vol 5, no 3, (1966), pp. 322-347.&lt;/ref&gt; claiming in 1966 that "our age, like his, is one of misery", regrets that Ibn Khaldun had "no predecessors and no successors ... not until four centuries after his death did he rise from his long sleep." In 1868 French Arabists translated the Muqaddimah; "the world was amazed, but he remained a lonely pioneer without followers ... the world has yet to prove that history can exist independently of the theological setting that gives it meaning".&lt;ref&gt;ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese philosopher [[Hajime Tanabe]] points to the quasi-religious role of the state to mediate between mortal individuals and the eternal universe, so that states regularly collapse; like religious figures, they must undergo a process of death and [[resurrection]]. In his view this may account for the perennial popularity of states because they regularly demonstrate their ability to transcend death.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Mcgreal, ''Great Thinkers of the Eastern World'', Harper Collins, 1995, p, 388.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to psychologist [[Erich Fromm]] it is possible for an entire nation, if they all share the same vices and errors, to become insane—a ''"folie a millions"''. Inhuman treatment by the rulers inevitably leads to collapse; &lt;blockquote&gt; Despots and ruling cliques can succeed in dominating and exploiting their fellow man ... but their subjects react ... with apathy, impairment of intelligence, initiative and skills ... or they react by the accumulation of such hate and destructiveness as to bring about an end to themselves, their rulers and their system. ... if man lives under conditions contrary to his nature and to human growth and sanity, he cannot help reacting.'&lt;ref&gt;Erich Fromm, ''The Sane Society'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1979, pp. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Mark Blyth]] alleges that a democracy can also collapse "if voters don't get what they want and merely affirm the status quo." In these circumstances, voters deprived of real choice may opt for the least democratic option.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Blyth]], "When Does Democracy Fail?", ''[[Washington Post]]'', 15 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marina Ottaway]]&lt;ref&gt;Marina Ottaway, "Rebuilding State Institutions in Collapsed States", ''[[Development and Change]]'', 33 (5), 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; discusses the collapse of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1918, [[British India]] in 1947, [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|the collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the collapse of [[Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa|South Africa's white supremacist government]] in 1993, of [[Czechoslovakia]] the following year, and of [[Yugoslavia]]. [[Harold Perkin]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Perkin]], "The Rise and Fall of Empires", ''[[History Today]]'', 4 April 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; sees "an acceleration of the process of collapse ... the [20th century] saw the collapse of seven great empires: [[Imperial China]], Germany, Austria-Hungary, [[Ottoman Turkey]], the [[Japanese empire]], the British Empire, and Russia, twice". Furthermore, the 20th Century saw the collapse of the French and Portuguese Empires.

[[John Kenneth Galbraith]] regrets the "very slight" amount of research on political power in such cases.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kenneth Galbraith]], ''The Anatomy of Power'', Hamish Hamilton, 1984, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Power regularly passes to those who "assert the unknown with the greatest conviction... not necessarily related to intelligence."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kenneth Galbraith]], ''The Anatomy of Power'', Hamish Hamilton, 1984, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;  What we call "power" is, "in practice, the illusion of power."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kenneth Galbraith]], ''The Anatomy of Power'', Hamish Hamilton, 1984, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing how the "powerless" [[Mahatma Gandhi]] brought about the collapse of militarily "powerful" [[British India]], Galbraith reflects that power, mostly seen as a possession of states and their leaders, would be better viewed as a flow, into and away from "those instruments that enforce it".&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kenneth Galbraith]], ''The Anatomy of Power'', Hamish Hamilton, 1984, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Few political scientists credibly predicted the collapse of the Soviet Union or agreed on its causes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joshua S Goldstein]] and Jon C Pevehouse, ''International Relations'', Longman, 2007, p. 43; Richard K Hermann, ''Ending the Cold War'', Palgrave, 2004, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  No one predicted the [[Arab spring]].&lt;ref&gt;Chris Doyle, "The Arab Spring Didn't Fail", ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 17 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Though many writings study particular cases of state collapse in isolation,&lt;ref&gt;See [[William Shirer]], ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'', Mandarin, 1960; [[Edward Crankshaw]], ''Fall of the House of Habsburg'', Cardinal, 1970; [[Dmitri Volkogonov]], ''The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire'', Harper Collins, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; there appears to be no contemporary text which compares events on a global historical basis and identifies common features.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see Ludger Helms, ''Comparative Political Leadership'', Palgrave, 2012, which contains many references to present-day western leaders, but only passing or no mentions of Hitler, Saddam, Mussolini, South Africa, Iraq, Yugoslavia.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Wight]], like Saunders, deplored the "demonic concentrations of power" of the defeated countries in the two world wars. A devout Christian, he saw their "triumphant self-destruction" as "Antichrist moments".&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hall, ''The International Thought of Martin Wight'', Palgrave, 2006, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; He disliked the modern secular tendency to view politics as a succession of questions (the [[Eastern question]], the [[two-state solution]]) with "solutions" which are devoid of moral content,&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hall, ''The International Thought of Martin Wight'', Palgrave, 2006, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; because &lt;blockquote&gt; The members of international society are, on the whole, immortals. States do die or disappear occasionally, but mostly they outlive the span of human life. They are partnerships of the living with posterity ... A society of immortals will be looser than one of mortals ... there are moral difficulties about indicting a whole nation, because (to do so) would make the passive majority suffer for the acts of the criminal minority, and future generations for the sins of the fathers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Wight]], ''[[Power Politics (Wight book)|Power Politics]]'', Pelican, 1978, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regarding the idea of a state being immortal, the [[nation]] called [[Russia]] has survived the collapse of two different political systems:  [[Imperial Russia]], a monarchy, in 1917; and the [[Soviet Union]], a communist totalitarianism, in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dmitri Volkogonov]], ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire]]'', Harper Collins, 1998, chapters one and seven.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, though Germany, ruled by the [[Nazi Party]], was defeated in 1945 and the nation, Germany, was dismembered, it was [[German reunification|resurrected in 1990]].&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hall, quoting Martin Wight, ''The International thought of Martin Wight'', Palgrave, 2006, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Examples of state collapse through [[civil war]] include: the [[War of the Roses]] in 15th-century England; the [[Thirty years war]] (1618–48); the [[Irish Civil War]] (1916-22); the [[Chinese Communist Revolution]] (1949); and the [[Cuban Revolution]] (1958).  State collapses through revolutions, not featuring civil war, took place in [[Xinhai Revolution|Imperial China]] (1911), in [[Russian Empire|Russia]] (1917), and in [[Iranian Revolution|Iran]] (1979). Collapse through ''[[Coup d'etat|Coups d'etat]]'' occurred in [[History of the Republic of Egypt|Egypt]] (1952), in [[Iraqi Republic (1958–68)|Iraq]] (1958), and in [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libya]] (1969). Negotiated surrenders of power took place in the [[English Commonwealth]] (1660); and in the collapse of the Soviet Union (1991), when it fragmented into fifteen independent states.

Mediaeval England was the scene of several violent dynastic collapses:  the fall of the West Saxon kings, when [[William the Conqueror]] defeated [[Harold Godwinson]] in 1066;&lt;ref&gt;''Chambers Dictionary of World History'', Editor Hilary Marsden, Chambers Harrap, 2005, p 382-3&lt;/ref&gt; the [[civil war]] known as [[The Anarchy]] from 1139-1153 between [[Stephen]] and [[Empress Matilda]], a time when 'Christ and his saints were asleep', which ended the Norman line of kings;&lt;ref&gt;Jim Bradbury, ''[[Stephen and Matilda: the Civil War of 1139-53]]'', Stroud, 2009, p 215&lt;/ref&gt; the reign of the last [[Angevin kings of England|Angevin]], [[John, King of England]], known as 'Lackland' for his military incompetence in losing Anjou;&lt;ref&gt;Chambers Dictionary of World History, Editor Hilary Marsden, Chambers Harrap, 2005, p 36&lt;/ref&gt; the [[tyranny]] of the last [[Plantagenet]] monarch, [[Richard II]], who was defeated by Henry, duke of Lancaster, later [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]];&lt;ref&gt;Chambers Dictionary of World History, Editor Hilary Marsden, Chambers Harrap, 2005, p 696&lt;/ref&gt; the destruction of the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] dynasty during the [[Wars of the Roses]], and especially at the [[battle of Tewkesbury]] in 1471;&lt;ref&gt;''Chambers Dictionary of World History'', Editor Hilary Marsden, Chambers Harrap, 2005, p 498, 875&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[battle of Bosworth]], which saw the end of [[Richard III]] and the [[Yorkist]] line &lt;ref&gt;''Chambers Dictionary of World History'', Editor Hilary Marsden, Chambers Harrap, 2005, p 115, 966&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1850-1864) was a civil war in [[China]] between the established [[Manchu people|Manchu]]-led [[Qing dynasty]] and the Christian [[millenarian]] movement of the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom|Heavenly Kingdom of Peace]]. It was the second-worst conflict in history; 20-30 millions died over 15 years. In 1858-60 the [[Qing dynasty]] effectively collapsed as France and the UK invaded and imposed [[unequal treaties]]. In 1864 the Taiping regime also collapsed and the dynasty was reshaped in the [[Tongzhi Restoration]].

The [[partition of India]] in 1947 led to the creation of two independent nations, India and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Partition (n), 7. b |publisher=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=3rd |year=2005 |quote=The division of British India into India and Pakistan, achieved in 1947.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The partition displaced between 10 and 12 million Sikhs, Hindus and Moslems, creating overwhelming refugee crises; there was large-scale violence, with estimates of loss of life accompanying or preceding the partition disputed and varying between several hundred thousand and two million.{{sfn|Talbot|Singh|2009|p=2}}{{efn|"The death toll remains disputed with figures ranging from 200,000 to 2 million."{{sfn|Talbot|Singh|2009|p=2}}}}{{full citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Failed attempts at reform in the Soviet Union, a standstill economy, and defeat in the [[Soviet–Afghan War|war in Afghanistan]] led to a general feeling of discontent, especially in the [[Baltic states|Baltic republics]] and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;WorldBook online&lt;/ref&gt; Greater political and social freedoms, instituted by the last Soviet leader, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s policies of [[Glasnost]] and [[Perestroika]] encouraged open criticism of the [[Communist state|communist regime]]. The dramatic drop of the [[1980s oil glut|price of oil in 1985 and 1986]] profoundly influenced actions of the Soviet leadership.&lt;ref name='AEI-Gaidar-Grain and Oil'&gt;{{cite web|last=Gaidar |first=Yegor |authorlink=Yegor Gaidar |title=The Soviet Collapse: Grain and Oil |work=On the Issues: AEI online |publisher=American Enterprise Institute |date=****-**-** |url=http://www.aei.org/issue/25991 |accessdate=2009-07-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722091512/http://www.aei.org/issue/25991 |archivedate=22 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }} (Edited version of a speech given November **, **** at the American Enterprise Institute.)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Reagan]] administration in the 1980s placed [[Pershing II]] missiles in western Europe in order to escalate the [[Cold War]], overstretch the USSR economy and bring about its downfall because 'they can't sustain military spending the way we can'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dmitri Volkogonov]], The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire, Harper Collins, 1997, p488&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union finally collapsed in 1991 when [[Boris Yeltsin]] seized power in the aftermath of a [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|failed coup]] that had attempted to topple Gorbachev.

The [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] collapsed in the 1990s, when its six socialist republics broke apart to become separate countries; though [[Slovenia]] seceded peacefully, civil wars broke out in [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia]] and [[Kosovo]], then part of [[Serbia]]. [[Ethnic cleansing]] and [[genocide]] erupted, including the [[Srebrenica massacre]] and [[Bosnian genocide]].

The apartheid system in [[South Africa]] ended through [[negotiation]]s between the governing [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], the [[African National Congress]], and other political organizations, resulting in South Africa's first non-racial [[South African general election, 1994|election]], which was won by the [[African National Congress]].
Concerns were raised about the future of its nuclear weapons but they were dismantled.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Sampson]], ''Mandela'', QPD, 1999, p 468&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential for instability==
In a [[totalitarian]] state or an [[ideocracy]], individuals may develop a [[closed mind]] and an [[authoritarian personality]], making them more likely to resist threats to the incumbent regime.&lt;ref&gt;Piekalkiewicz and Penn, ''The Politics of Ideocracy'', SUNY Press, 1995, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Alter]], "The Masada complex", ''[[Commentary magazine]]'', 1 July 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerrold M. Post]], editor, ''The Psychological Assessment of Political Leaders'', University of Michigan Press, 2003, p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt; speak of a "[[Masada]] complex" that may drive fanatics to a suicidal, violent last-ditch stand. Former [[British Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] has commented that  "History teaches that dangers are never greater than when empires break up."&lt;ref&gt;[[Margaret Thatcher]], ''The Downing Street Years'', Harper Collins, 1993, p. 769.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new regime gains power, not through the truth of its doctrines and promises, but through its ability to organize and absorb the frustrated masses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 2010, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; As Pope Francis warned in 2017, "in times of crisis, we lack judgement".&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Osborne]], ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]'', 22 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The timidity of the old regime contrasts with the boldness of those in rebellion against it;  "Where power is not joined with faith in the future, it is used mainly to ward off the new and preserve the status quo. On the other hand, extravagant hope, even when not backed by actual power, is likely to generate reckless daring."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 2010, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; "The frustrated see in a general downfall an approach to the brotherhood of all. Chaos, like the grave, is a haven of equality."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 2010, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to political scientists, in an [[ideocracy]] there must be a ruthless charismatic leader: "the leader is the movement",&lt;ref&gt;Piekalkiewicz and Penn, ''Politics of Ideocracy'', State University of New York, 1995, p133&lt;/ref&gt; and all individuals are required to submit to, and worship him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erich Fromm]], ''The Sane Society'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1955, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; "Followers who lead barren, insecure, frustrated lives obey the leader, not through faith in his vision of a '[[Promised land]]', but because he leads them away from their unwanted selves".&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hoffer, ''The True Believer'', Harper Perennial 2010, p 100, 119&lt;/ref&gt; When collapse threatens he may insist on a "fight to the finish".

Hitler, according to [[Walter Langer]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Mind of Adolf Hitler]]'', Pan, 1972, p 33, 55&lt;/ref&gt; had a [[Messiah complex]] and saw himself as the "Saviour of Germany" who performed "miracles" with the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Haffner, The Meaning of Hitler, Phoenix 2002, p 27-30&lt;/ref&gt; He was unnaturally fond of his mother, to the extent that Germany became a "mother symbol".&lt;ref&gt;Walter Langer, ''[[The Mind of Adolf Hitler]]'', Pan 1972, p 155.&lt;/ref&gt; His drive to destroy (the Jews, communism, Europe) was an unconscious attempt to resolve his [[Oedipus complex]] and the injustices of his childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Langer, ''[[The Mind of Adolf Hitler]]'', Pan 1972, p 157&lt;/ref&gt; He "dismantled the German state ... and replaced it with a war machine".&lt;ref&gt;[[Sebastian Haffner]], ''[[The Meaning of Hitler]]'', Pelican 2002, p. 40, 42.&lt;/ref&gt; He was swept along by a tide of events.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hall, ''The international thought of Martin Wight'', Palgrave 2006, p 47&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mussolini]], according to [[Denis Mack Smith]], "was an actor, playing the part that Italians wanted him to be".&lt;ref&gt;''Mussolini'', Phoenix, 1993, p112-15&lt;/ref&gt; He was vindictive, sadistic, impulsive, proud and cruel, full of "demonic wilfulness" and did not know right from wrong. When in 1944 he led a [[puppet state]] in northern Italy, he "divided Italy in two and initiated 18 months of terrible civil war."&lt;ref&gt;Denis Mack Smith, ''Mussolini'', Phoenix 1993, p 300&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ken Livingstone]] has compared [[Slobodan Milosevic]] to Hitler for his racism and expansionist goals.&lt;ref&gt;'Why we are not wrong to compare Milosevic to Hitler', ''Independent'', 20/4/1999&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saddam Hussein]], who also suffered from a Messiah complex,&lt;ref&gt;Jerrold M Post, ''The psychological assessment of political leaders'', University of Michigan Press, 2003, p 354&lt;/ref&gt; was similar: "Hitler was not one of a kind. As long as millions of people passionately long for his return, it is only a matter of time until their wish is fulfilled."&lt;ref&gt;Hans Enzensburger, "Perspective on Saddam Hussein", ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 14 February 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] "went mad" as early as 1971 according to [[John Sweeney (journalist)|John Sweeney]], when, "blind to his own Messianism", he attempted to recreate [[North Korea]]n [[totalitarianism]] in [[Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;John Sweeney, ''The life and evil times of Nicolae Ceausescu'', Hutchinson, 1991, p99&lt;/ref&gt; He "played the king" and the role of "chosen one" and "saviour".&lt;ref&gt;John Sweeney, ''The life and evil times of Nicolae Ceausescu'', Hutchinson, 1991, p155&lt;/ref&gt; [[Czar Nicholas II]] by contrast was deferential. Acceding at an early age, 26, he was untrained in governance.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Van der Kiste]], ''The Romanovs'', Sutton, 1998, p154&lt;/ref&gt; Grand Duke Vladimir's son Cyril was a rival candidate for the throne.&lt;ref&gt;John Van der Kiste, ''The Romanovs'', Sutton, 1998, p 175&lt;/ref&gt; Liberals and revolutionaries challenged his autocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, ''The Romanovs'', Sutton, 1998, p 176&lt;/ref&gt; By 1916 he had become apathetic, dominated by the Czarina and [[Rasputin]],&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, ''The Romanovs'', Sutton, 1998, p 187&lt;/ref&gt; a "Christ in the image of the rejected and agonizing monarchy".&lt;ref&gt;[[Leon Trotsky]], ''The history of the Russian Revolution'', translated  by Max Eastman, Pluto Press 1977, p 84&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of the USSR, a Marxist [[Revolutionary wave]] had formed in which several subordinate regimes in Eastern Europe and Africa collapsed almost simultaneously with the central power.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Katz, ''Revolutions and Revolutionary Waves'', St martin's Press, 1997, pp 83-87&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] saw the USSR as "on the way to civil war" and tried to conciliate both reformers and hardliners.&lt;ref&gt;[[Steve Rosenberg]], [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-38289333 BBC online interview with Gorbachev], 2016-12-13&lt;/ref&gt; He and [[F.W. De Klerk]] in South Africa focused on acknowledging and managing decline, rather than "heroically" attempting to deny it. They have enjoyed better reputations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mary|last=Dejevsky|title=Two new faces of democracy; both Gorbachev and de Klerk tried to dismantle untenable regimes|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/two-new-faces-of-democracy-both-gorbachev-and-de-klerk-tried-to-dismantle-untenable-regimes-history-1434677.html|work=Independent|date=1994-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in China, Gorbachev is seen as a dismal failure who capitulated to the West.&lt;ref&gt;James Palmer, 'What China didn't learn from the collapse of the Soviet Union, Foreign Policy, 2016-12-24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequence of events==

===Buildup to collapse===
State collapse is often a gradual process of slow, imperceptible, generational change.&lt;ref&gt;Crane Brinton, ''The Anatomy of Revolution'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Chris Patten]], ''What next?'', Penguin, 2009, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt; Only the courageous are prepared for [[speaking truth to power]]; the majority 'go with the flow', as with Jewish passivity in the face of the creeping corruption of Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;See the Diary of [[Victor Klemperer]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Collapse is often preceded externally by war, and internally by overpopulation and repression.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Khaldun, ''The Muqaddimah'' Routledge 1978, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[Paul Kennedy]] points out, 'Nations in decline instinctively spend more on "security" and thus compound their long-term dilemma.'&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''The rise and fall of the Great Powers'', 1985, p. 486.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of a revolution the crisis is reached when 'the old regime is no longer able to mobilise force'.&lt;ref&gt;Crane Brinton, ''The Anatomy of Revolution'', p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regeneration===
Either the incumbent regime itself, or an extremist [[reactionary]] group dissatisfied with its performance, may attempt to postpone or avoid collapse by regenerating popular support; 'At the end of a dynasty there often appears some show of power giving the impression that the dynasty's senility has been made to disappear. It lights up brilliantly just before it is extinguished, like a candle which leaps up brilliantly just before it is put out.' &lt;ref&gt;Ibn Khaldun, ''The Muqaddimah'', Routledge 1978, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
To do so they may have to take 'heroic' measures; 'Throughout history there have always been in the event of defeat two paths of action; the one aims at saving enough of the substance as possible. the other at leaving behind a stirring legend.'&lt;ref&gt;Sebastain Haffner, ''The meaning of Hitler'', Pelican, 2000, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Piekalkiewicz and Penn, they may rethink or adapt the ideology, or replace it by a completely new set of ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Piekalkiewicz and Penn, ''The Politics of Ideocracy'', SUNY Press, 1995, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Poland, according to Piekalkiewicz and Penn, communist ideocracy failed in 1980; the recognition of [[Lech Walesa]]'s [[Solidarity]] Trade Union led to a military coup and authoritarian military rule.

According to [[Sabrina Ramet]], regenerative changes occurred in Yugoslavia in the 1980s when the communist ideology was replaced by a nationalist drive for a [[Greater Serbia]] and by an [[anti-bureaucratic revolution]] in support of [[Slobodan Milosevic]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Sabrina Ramet]], ''The three Yugoslavias'', Indiana UP, 2006, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Young Turk]] coup of 1908,&lt;ref&gt;Tony Barber, 'Decline and Fall', review of ''Shattering Empires'' by Michael Reynolds, ''Financial Times'', 4/4/2011.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[1991 Soviet coup d'etat attempt]],&lt;ref&gt;Dmitri Volkogonov, ''The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire'', Harper Collins, 1997, pp. 485-7.&lt;/ref&gt; and the financial/industrial reforms of [[Sergei Witte]] in Imperial Russia,&lt;ref&gt;Tony Barber, 'Decline and Fall', review of ''Tales of Imperial Russia'' by [[Francis Wcislo]] (sic), ''Financial Times'', 4/4/2011.&lt;/ref&gt; were all aimed at regenerating causes which were nearing collapse.

===Crisis point===

When collapse - whether through civil war, revolution, [[coup d'état]], or military defeat and/or invasion - becomes unavoidable and immediate, law and order may break down. There may be [[Ethnic cleansing]] or [[Genocide]]. Hitler ordered the killing of invalids, Gypsies, Russians and Jews in the [[Final solution]].&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Haffner, ''The Meaning of Hitler'', Pelican 2002, chapter on 'Crimes'&lt;/ref&gt; In Ottoman Turkey, estimates for the death toll in the [[Armenian genocide]] vary between 300,000 and 1.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Barber, 'Decline and Fall', Financial Times, 4/4/2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Pacific theatre of [[World War II]], [[Occupation of Japan|Japan's collapse]] was hastened by nuclear destruction of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]].
 
When [[Ottoman Turkey]] collapsed at the end of [[World War I]], it lost territory, including what became [[Syria]], [[Iraq]] and [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]; the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire gave rise to [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungary]] and the Austrian Republic, while [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]] became part of Yugoslavia]]. Nazi Germany in 1945 fragmented into East and West Germany, while [[Pomerania]] and [[Silesia]] became part of Poland

===Post-collapse===

In 1946, the Diet ratified a new [[Constitution of Japan]]&lt;ref&gt;Takemae, Eiji 2002, p. xxxvii.&lt;/ref&gt; The new constitution drafted by Americans allowed access and control over the Japanese military through MacArthur and the Allied occupation on Japan.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Transformed:1945 to the Present|last=Hunt|first=Michael|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780199371020|location=|pages=86|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The political project drew much of its inspiration from the [[US Bill of Rights|U.S. Bill of Rights]], [[New Deal]] social legislation, the [[liberal constitution]]s of several European states and even the Soviet Union."&lt;ref&gt;Takemae, Eiji 2002, p. xxxix.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recovery from collapse is often improved by formal or informal efforts at justice, such as the [[Nuremberg trials]] and the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)]]. [[Slobodan Milosevic]] and [[Saddam Hussein]] were also tried in court, but [[Mussolini]] and [[Colonel Gaddafi]] were murdered by mobs.

The collapse of the Ottomans in 1918 had long-term consequences, 'triggering most of the problems that plague the Middle East today.' &lt;ref&gt;[[Ali A. Allawi]], 'The Ottoman Empire: the last great casualty of the first world war', [[The Spectator]], 2/5/2015&lt;/ref&gt; Hegemony in the Middle East has been subject to quarrels between British, French,&lt;ref&gt;[[Avi Shlaim]], 'The Balfour Declaration: A Study in British Duplicity', [[Middle East Eye]], 25/8/2017&lt;/ref&gt; Zionist,&lt;ref&gt;[[Israel Shahak]], 'Greater Israel: the Zionist Plan for the Middle East', [[Global Research Council|Global Research]], November 2017&lt;/ref&gt; American,&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Green, 'Why Western Democracy can never work in the Middle East', [[The Daily Telegraph]],16/8/2014&lt;/ref&gt; Arab nationalist,&lt;ref&gt;[[Adeed Dawisha]], 'Requiem for Arab Nationalism', [[Middle East Quarterly]], Winter 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi and Iranian interests &lt;ref&gt;Syed Mansur Hashim, 'Who will rule the Middle East?', The Daily Star, 12/1/2016&lt;/ref&gt; ever since.

Hitler, says [[Sebastian Haffner]], 'whether we like it or not', created many features of the postwar world, including the state of Israel, the end of European empires, the division of Germany, and the joint hegemony of the US and USSR.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Haffner, The Meaning of Hitler, Phoenix, 2000, p 100&lt;/ref&gt;

==States allegedly at risk of collapse==

Paul Stares and Helia Aghani suggest that [[Saudi Arabia]] could lapse into a succession crisis and civil war if [[Mohammed bin Salman]]'s accession is contested after the death of his aging father, [[king Salman]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Stares and Helia Aghani, "How Stable is Saudi Arabia?", [[Council on Foreign Relations]], 15 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lebanon]] and [[Jordan]] could collapse following the influx of refugees from [[Syria]] and the resultant burden on infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;[[Azeem Ibrahim]], 'Lebanon and Jordan may collapse under a new wave of refugees', [[Al Arabiya English]], 2016-06-26&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Colonel Gaddafi]] of Libya agreed to dismantle his nuclear and chemical weapons programme. In 2011 he was deposed and murdered. This is the reason, according to [[Forbes magazine]], for North Korea to seek to guarantee its security and invulnerability through continuing its nuclear weapons programme.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kaplan and Rodger Baker, 'Why North Korea needs nukes', Forbes, 2013-12-04&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Embury-Dennis claims that [[North Korea]] could collapse "within a year" as new US sanctions take effect.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Embury-Dennis, "North Korea Could Collapse within a Year", ''[[The Independent]]'', 17 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Venezuela]], protests and riots against the authoritarian rule of [[Nicolas Maduro]] have steadily increased since 2014, while the economy and social infrastructure have worsened.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Gillespie et al, 'Venezuela; how a rich country collapsed'. CNN, July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emmanuel Todd]], one of the first to predict the fall of the USSR, now predicts the collapse of the US in his book ''[[After the Empire: The Breakdown of the American Order]]''. According to Iranian general Reza Naqdi, the US will collapse by 2035 and the Trump presidency is hastening that process.&lt;ref&gt;anon, 'Israel will collapse within ten years', Israel Today, 2016-11-29&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret McMillan]] has compared [[President Trump]] to [[Mussolini]], on the grounds that President Trump similarly seeks attention, makes grand gestures, plays the 'strong man' and seeks out enemies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Olivia Gordon]], quoting [[Margaret McMillan]] in 'Trump is no Hitler - he's a Mussolini', [[Oxford Today]], 2017-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nigel Lawson]] predicts that the [[European Union]] will become a federal superstate;&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Lawson, '[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/02/the-eu-exists-only-to-become-a-superstate-britain-has-no-place-i/ The EU exists only to become a superstate]', Telegraph, 2016-05-02&lt;/ref&gt; also likely to collapse, according to the Polish president, [[Andrzej Duda]],&lt;ref&gt;James Shorter, '[https://www.ft.com/content/d18b8b56-9240-11e7-bdfa-eda243196c2c Polish president warns multispeed EU will collapse]', Financial Times, 2017-09-05&lt;/ref&gt; journalist [[Stephen Pollard]],&lt;ref&gt;'the EU will collapse within ten years', The Express, 2017-09-23&lt;/ref&gt; German economist [[Thorsten Polleit]],&lt;ref&gt;Nick Gutteridge, 'German economist predicts EU will collapse', Express, 2017-08-25&lt;/ref&gt; and a leaked German Government contingency plan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nick Mason]], '[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/06/the-germans-are-making-contingency-plans-for-the-collapse-of-europe-lets-hope-we-are-too The Germans are making contingency plans for the collapse of Europe. Let's hope we are too.]' [[The Guardian]], 2017-11-06&lt;/ref&gt;

S Daniel Abraham anticipates the collapse of [[Israel]], where Palestinians will soon outnumber Jews, if the [[History of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Palestinian problem]] is not resolved;&lt;ref&gt;S Daniel Abraham, 'How Israel will be destroyed without one shot being fired', [[Haaretz]], 2013-01-16&lt;/ref&gt; Iqbal Jassat compares the situation  to [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Iqbal Jassat, 'Israel faces inevitable collapse of its apartheid system', Middle East Monitor 2017-03-27&lt;/ref&gt; A secret CIA report sees the end of Israel by 2022.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan Jones, ''Israel today'', 'CIA sees end of Israel by 2022', 1st July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Pakistan]], Islamic militants are allegedly infiltrating the military and nuclear weapons systems. There are fears of collapse into nuclear war with India, or of chaos enabling extremists to seize [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Leigh (journalist)|David Leigh]], "Wikileaks Cables Expose Pakistan Nuclear Fears", [[The Guardian]], 30 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gordon G. Chang]], in editions of ''[[The Coming Collapse of China]]'', has made several predictions of collapse, none of which have materialised. [[Bruce Gilley]] sees a largely peaceful process unfolding.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Gilley]], ''China's Democratic Future'', Columbia University Press, 2004, chapter six: "The democratic breakthrough, extrication or overthrow?".&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Shambaugh]] says China must either liberalise to become a developed economy–as Taiwan and South Korea have–or else remain authoritarian and endure a stagnating economy.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Johnson , "Q and A David Shambaugh",  ''[[The New York Times]]'', 30 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; "We cannot predict when Chinese communism will collapse, but it is hard not to conclude that we are seeing its final phases."&lt;ref&gt;Xie Tao, quoting Shambaugh in "Why Do People Keep Predicting China's Collapse?', ''[[The Diplomat]]'', March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Katz&lt;ref&gt;Mark Katz, ''Revolutions and Revolutionary Waves'', St Martin's Press, 1997, p107-112&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the [[Islamic fundamentalist]] [[revolutionary wave]] led by [[Iran]] could collapse, but "must first expand significantly" and then experience a "crisis of confidence".

[[Geoff Mulgan]]&lt;ref&gt;Geoff Mulgan, ''Good and Bad Power'', Penguin 2007, p321&lt;/ref&gt; has called for; "new structures of [[government]] above the nation-state... this task is essential for Human survival".

==In popular culture==
There are many semi-fictional books and films, which dramatically demonstrate the turbulent effects of collapse upon innocent or naive individuals. [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]'s film, ''[[The Last Emperor]]'', showed the collapse of both Imperial China and [[Manchukuo]], as well as the post-collapse trial and rehabilitation of [[Pu Yi]]. [[Bruno Ganz]] played Hitler in ''[[Downfall (2004 film)|Downfall]]'', which depicts the final days of Germany's [[Third Reich]]. Events from the period,
as seen by prisoners at [[Auschwitz]], are shown in [[Primo Levi]]'s memoir, ''[[If This Is a Man]]'', and in the [[graphic novel]]s ''[[Maus]]'' and ''[[Maus II]]''. [[Kurt Vonnegut]] witnessed the [[bombing of Dresden]] and fictionalized the experience in ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]''.

[[Robert K. Massie]]'s book about the last Russian tsar, ''[[Nicholas and Alexandra]]'', was also filmed. ''[[Doctor Zhivago]]'' and ''[[And Quiet Flows the Don]]'' (filmed as ''War and Revolution'') relate stories of families caught up in the collapse of [[Russia]].  ''[[The House of the Mosque]]'' and ''[[Persepolis (comics)|Persepolis]]'' depict the collapse of [[Iran]].

The ''[[Left Behind]]'' series of novels by ''[[Tim LaHaye]]'' and ''[[Jerry B. Jenkins]]'' features the supposed role of [[Israel]] in the [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] [[End Times]]. In the spy novel, ''[[The Mask of Dimitrios (novel)|The Mask of Dimitrios]]'' (1939), [[Eric Ambler]] comments:  "In a dying civilization, political prestige goes not to the man with the shrewdest diagnosis, but to the one with the best bedside manner."

"'''Thank God for Mississippi'''" is a common [[adage]] in the [[United States]], particularly in the [[Southern United States|South]], that is generally used when discussing [[rankings]] of [[U.S. state]]s.&lt;ref&gt; Key, V.

Mississippi's poor reputation is such a common trope in American culture that when Mississippi does indeed rank well in something, the phrase "Thank God for Mississippi" may get brought up just to discuss how it does not apply in the given circumstance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/mississippi-thad-cochran-108289.html|title=‘Thank God for Mississippi!’|author=Larry J.

'''''The Broken Compass: How British Politics Lost its Way''''' is the fourth book by British writer [[Peter Hitchens]], published in May 2009. Polemical and partly autobiographical, the book contends that the British [[political right]] and [[Left-wing politics|left]] no longer hold firm, adversarial beliefs, but vie for position in the [[center (politics)|centre]], while at the same time overseeing a general decline in [[British society]].

Hitchens depicts the right in particular as a confused and spent political force that has been subsumed by the [[centre-left]], itself a product of [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] [[social democracy]]. As a result of these factors, "there is no longer any debate between the political parties about issues that have divided thinkers down the ages, and divide the population even now".&lt;ref name="Hitchens-168"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchens concludes that, since the compass is broken, the time has come in British politics for the re-establishment of a proper [[adversarial system]] and for principles to be rediscovered.

In the media, ''The Broken Compass'' received mostly negative reviews from left-leaning newspapers, and was largely ignored by the conservative press. It was reissued as '''''The Cameron Delusion''''' in March 2010, two months before [[David Cameron]] became the British Prime Minister.

==Background==
Hitchens sets out his stall in the preface "The Lost Frontier", stating: "conventional wisdom is almost always wrong. By the time it has become conventional, it has ceased to be wisdom and become cant. Its smug cousin, received opinion, is just as bad. The aim of this book is to defy these two enemies of thought and reason", and "conventional wisdom's biggest single mistake is its thought-free, obsolete idea of Left and Right".&lt;ref name="Hitchens-vii"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a column written before the book's publication, Hitchens also explored themes contained in ''The Broken Compass'', and wrote "The cold, miserable truth is that both our major political parties are corpses, their original purposes long forgotten, their loyal members driven away or sidelined, and their traditional voters taken for granted".&lt;ref name=" political parties are corpses"&gt;{{cite news

==Synopsis==

===Part I: The New Permanent Government of Britain===
[[File:GordonBrown2004.JPG|thumb|upright|In ''The Broken Compass'' Hitchens criticises the media's portrayal of [[Gordon Brown]].]]
In Chapter 1, "Guy Fawkes Gets a Blackberry", Hitchens claims that opinion polls are a device for influencing [[public opinion]] and not measuring it, and that political parties and newspapers are responsible for this [[Misuse of statistics|manipulation]], whose purpose is to "bring about the thing it claims is already happening".&lt;ref name="Hitchens-5"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author cites contemporary examples of the media attacking [[Gordon Brown]] and the expected win of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]].&lt;ref name="Hitchens-8"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchens begins Chapter 2, "The Power of Lunch", by asserting, based on his time as a reporter at Westminster, that political journalists are uninterested in serious political debate; propagate received centre-left standpoints on issues; and consult with each other and politicians about media stories. Chapter 3, "Time for a Change", describes how a [[Media bias|media reporting bias]] is attempting to facilitate a Tory general election win. Hitchens states one of his motivations in writing the book was to frustrate this exercise.&lt;ref name="Hitchens-29"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchens claims in Chapter 4, "Fear of Finding Something Worse", that Labour has reached "the most significant moment in its history – the complete acceptance of its programme by the Conservatives".&lt;ref name="Hitchens-31"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author invokes the closing image of [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'' to illustrate how close the two parties have become.&lt;ref&gt;i.e., in reference to the line "The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from man to pig again; but already it was impossible to say which was which". Hitchens also quotes this line at the beginning of the book's preface&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter 5, "The Great Landslide", discusses how a number of left-wing writers and newspapers have begun describing the Conservatives in favourable terms, and how this no longer constituted "a form of treason".&lt;ref name="Hitchens-49"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part II: The Left Escapes to the West===
Chapter 6, "Riding the Prague Tram", describes Hitchens's experience of travelling in [[Eastern Bloc|Communist Bloc]] countries before the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] and how this, combined with the behaviour of certain left-wing organisations in the UK, led to his becoming disillusioned with the British Left. He also carries out a lengthy critique of the Western Left's [[Apologetics|apologist]] stance towards Soviet Communism, including views held by [[Fabian Society]] members [[Beatrice Webb|Beatrice]] and [[Maurice Webb (politician)|Maurice Webb]]; the attempt to exonerate and romanticise [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] and [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]];&lt;ref name="Hitchens-60-61"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| pp=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; and intellectual resistance to the works of [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]] and [[Robert Conquest]]. In Chapter 7, "A Fire Burning Under Water", Hitchens describes the final stage in his becoming disenchanted with the British Left – the [[Trades Union Congress|British Trades Union Congress]]'s (TUC) failure to support the [[History of Solidarity|Gdańsk shipyard workers challenging]] their communist government.

===Part III: Britain Through the Looking Glass===
Chapter 8, "Racism, Sexism and Homophobia", examines how the modern ideology of race and the term racist differ from the previous concept of "racialism", and how the [[sexual revolution]] represents "seeking the existing order's permission to [[Hedonism|pursue pleasure at all costs]]",&lt;ref name="Hitchens-102"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; which undermines Christian principles of marriage, and has its roots in [[Protests of 1968|events in 1968]].&lt;ref name="Hitchens-104"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Chapter 9, "Sexism is Rational", Hitchens states that the Left's taking up feminist causes since the 1960s has led to the damage and exploitation of women,&lt;ref name="Hitchens-111"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a decline in marriage. Hitchens says this process is part of revolutionaries' seeking to "destroy and expunge the restraints placed on human selfishness by the Christian religion. The permanent married family is the greatest single obstacle to this".&lt;ref name="Hitchens-112"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchens concludes that in Britain there is an emerging citizenry "prepared for [[Slavery|enslavement]], ignorant of its origins, past, rights, traditions, and duties"&lt;ref name="Hitchens-114"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "only in a wholly broken political system could there be such a need for reform, and no reformers ready to address it".&lt;ref name="Hitchens-114"/&gt;

In Chapter 10, "Equality or Tolerance", Hitchens examines how the Left have since the 1960s taken up the cause of [[Gender equality|equal rights for homosexuals]]. Hitchens says supporters of [[Leo Abse]]'s 1967 law reform on homosexuality are now accused of intolerance if they do not support homosexual [[civil partnership]]s or [[Homophobia|discrimination on the grounds of homosexuality]]. Hitchens concludes by stating, "the [[atrophy]] of religion and patriotism in the Labour party, like the atrophy of the same things in the Tory Party, is the deep problem beneath all others".&lt;ref name="Hitchens-123"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Chapter 11, "The Fall of the Meritocracy", examines falling standards in British education. Hitchens cites the abolition of [[Grammar schools in the United Kingdom|grammar schools]] as one of the main causes, which has also resulted in a decline in [[social mobility]]. Hitchens claims [[Egalitarianism|egalitarians]] deny these consequences and that [[comprehensive education]] has failed. Hitchens also quotes a 2000 study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.org.uk/files/reports/original/111028112306-BetrayedGenerations.pdf|title= The Betrayed Generations – Standards in British Schools 1950–2000|publisher=[[Centre for Policy Studies]]|date= November 2000|author= Marks, John|accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which asserted that "the general lowering of standards and [[rigour]] since the end of [[Selective school|selection]] is one of the main reasons behind the current drive to devalue examinations".&lt;ref name="Hitchens-161"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchens asks why, "the educated, conscious servants of the state should seek to pretend that educational standards are rising when the opposite is true. The answer is that they have put equality before education".&lt;ref name="Hitchens-162"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter 12, "'The age of the train'", outlines how the Conservative and Labour parties facilitated the dismantling of much of Britain's rail network. Hitchens asserts this is evidence that the "Tory Party does not love Britain, any more than the Labour Party loves the poor".&lt;ref name="Hitchens-172"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chapter also provides a conservative argument against mass [[car ownership]], saying that "roads destroy and distort established ways of living", while "the traditional English town, with its defined centre, ancient street pattern and comfortable shape, was not destroyed by the coming of the railway. It was enhanced".&lt;ref name="Hitchens-169"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2010| p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Chapter 13, "A Comfortable Hotel on the Road to Damascus", Hitchens explores how since the [[September 11 attacks|2001 September 11 attacks]] and the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq]], certain commentators on the left realigned with an American [[neoconservatism|neoconservative]] position, which, "delivers him [the leftist commentator] to another portion of the 'centre ground', one where foreign policy is the only thing worth discussing, and where former conservatives and former Leftists can mingle in happy communion",&lt;ref name="Hitchens-180"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; and allows "political conservatism to soothe its tribal base by appearing strong overseas, while failing to be anything of the kind at home".&lt;ref name="Hitchens-195"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conclusion: The Broken Compass===
Hitchens asserts that political mismanagement, facilitated by an abandonment of the [[adversarial system]], has resulted in an overall [[Decadence|decline]] in British society. He identifies the end of the [[Cold War]] (which "made many of the old political positions meaningless overnight"&lt;ref name="Hitchens-198"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2009| p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;) as one cause of this, as well as the implementation of the ideas of [[Fabian Society|Fabian social democracy]] and the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|ideology of the 1960s]].

==Reception==
On publication the book was reviewed in ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Observer]]'' and the ''[[New Statesman]]'', was the occasion of two interviews with Hitchens with Hannah Pool in ''The Guardian'',&lt;ref name=" Being called a sexist "&gt;{{cite news

The reviews in the left-wing press were generally unfavourable; [[Peter Wilby]]'s review in ''The Observer'' was dismissive towards much of the book's contents. Wilby wrote "As Hitchens sees it, 'the broken compass' is chiefly the Conservatives' fault. Even under Thatcher, they accepted too many of Labour's social democratic and liberal reforms. So we have a permanent government of the centre and one of Labour's main aims is to stop a genuinely Conservative party emerging that may attract working-class votes on such issues as "immigration and disorder" and getting Britain out of Europe. 'It was greatly in Labour's interest, once the Tory party had accepted so much of Labour's programme as unalterable, that the Tory party should be preserved against the danger of dissolution,' Hitchens writes. There is a grain of truth in all this, but on the left most would reverse the argument. The postwar consensus was destroyed in the Thatcher years and Labour failed to restore it, accepting, at least until the credit crunch, unrestrained neoliberal capitalism. New Labour's appeal to business and the City was that it closed off, perhaps forever, the possibility of a genuinely socialist alternative".&lt;ref name=" Broken Compass_ Wilby"&gt;{{cite news

Writing in the ''New Statesman'', [[Anthony Howard (journalist)|Anthony Howard]] saw the book as "a hotchpotch of separate essays" and that, though Hitchens mounts a spirited defence of his beliefs, he nevertheless resembles "some faintly out-of-date figure searching the kitchen for any pot or pan he can hurl against the spirit of the age".&lt;ref name=" Broken Compass_ Howard "&gt;{{cite news

In a review in ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Steven Poole]] described Hitchens as being "in general exhilaratingly good when attacking the hypocrisies and stupidities of specific individuals",&lt;ref name=" Broken Compass_ Poole "&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote that the "best parts" of the book describe "scenes of foreign reporting, such as an alarming visit to [[Vilnius]] in 1991, where Soviet forces massacred Lithuanian nationalists".&lt;ref name=" Broken Compass_ Poole "/&gt; However, Poole also added that the book resorted too much to cultural generalisation.
[[File:The Cameron Delusion.jpg|thumb|upright|Revised edition, published as ''The Cameron Delusion'']]
Conservative newspapers and magazines, which had consistently reviewed Hitchens's previous books, largely ignored ''The Broken Compass''. The author bemoaned this in one of his columns,&lt;ref name=" Iain Dale's Diary "&gt;{{cite news

==Release details==
The book was first published in the UK on 11 May 2009 by Continuum International Publishing Group Ltd., and in the US on 20 June 2009 by Continuum, with the altered subtitle ''How Left and Right Lost Their Meaning''. In anticipation of the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], a revised paperback edition with the new title ''The Cameron Delusion'' was released in the UK on 17 March 2010.

==Index==
Poole in his ''Guardian'' review wrote that "Hitchens should at least be applauded for taking the trouble to provide an amusing index, a duty shirked by too many authors."

'''Thomas W. Noe''' (born July 1954) is an [[Ohio]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican party]] fundraiser and activist, guilty of [[money laundering]] for the [[George W. Bush presidential campaign, 2004|2004 Bush-Cheney campaign]] and of theft and corruption in the "[[Coingate scandal]]". A longtime resident of [[Toledo, Ohio]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050403/NEWS24/504030399]&lt;/ref&gt; Noeand his wife held several party positions and minor offices within the government of Ohio. He was also a prominent Republican fundraiser and served as chairman of the 2004 Bush-Cheney election campaign in Northwest Ohio and chairman of the [[Lucas County, Ohio|Lucas County]] Republican party. Noe was also an avid coin dealer and owned various coin dealing companies, such as ''Capital Coin'' and ''Vintage Coins &amp; Collectibles'', as well as their subsidiaries.

== Organizations and offices ==
=== The Republican Party ===
Both Noe and his wife Bernadette Restivo-Noe have been chairperson of the Lucas County Republican party. Noe was also chairman of the 2004 Bush-Cheney election campaign in Northwest Ohio. Noe was convicted of making illegal contributions to George W. Bush's 2004 presidential campaign.[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14805486/=]

=== Board of Elections ===
During the 2004 election, Noe's wife Bernadette was chairman of the Lucas County Board of Elections. In the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 election]], the county experienced extreme voting difficulties, including criminal investigations and manipulation of the recount,[https://web.archive.org/web/20050409051126/http://www.sos.state.oh.us/sos/elections/lucas.htm][https://web.archive.org/web/20050930112758/http://rawstory.com/other/pdfs/lucasinquiryrawstory.pdf] and many officials resigned or were suspended. The Ohio Secretary of State told Bernadette to resign or be fired. She resigned from both the Lucas County Republican Party and the Lucas County Board of Elections in December 2004.

=== Board of Regents ===
Noe was appointed to the Ohio Board of Regents, which oversees Ohio's public colleges and universities, by former Ohio Governor [[George Voinovich]] in 1995 to complete a vacated term. Noe was reinstated for a full 9-year term in 1999 by Governor [[Bob Taft]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

In late 2004, Noe wrote to the Ohio Ethics Commission to seek an opinion on his involvement with ''Hi-Genomics LLC'' which licenses a patent on plant genetic engineering from the [[University of Toledo]]. Noe was vice-president of ''Hi-Genomics LLC'' and owned a 23% stake in the company. Noe's position on the Board of Regents was deemed to be a conflict of interest by the Ohio Ethics Commission. Noe was told to either resign from the Board, divest his interest in the company, or step down as vice-president of the company. Noe eventually sold back his units in Hi-Genomics to one of the other unitholders.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

=== Turnpike Commission ===
In 2003 Governor Taft appointed Noe chairman of the [[Ohio Turnpike]] Commission for an 8-year term. On May 10, 2005, Noe resigned from the Turnpike Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toledoblade.com/assets/pdf/TO103991114.PDF|title=The Rise and Dramatic Fall of Tom Noe|format=PDF|accessdate=December 2, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coin politics and business ==
Apart from being President of his company, Thomas Noe Inc. (Noe owns 60%), Noe owns and/or manages many different companies that deal rare coins. His store, Vintage Coins &amp; Collectibles (or Vintage Coins &amp; Cards), is the parent company. Noe was also a statutory agent for the Professional Numismatists Guild, a nonprofit organization of top [[numismatics|numismatists]] whose members follow a strict code of ethics, for more than 25 years. He resigned in May 2005.

Noe served as chairman of the Ohio Commemorative Quarter Program Committee during its operation in the 2000s. Noe was appointed chairman of the U.S. Mint's [[Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee]] (CCAC) by U.S. Secretary of the Treasury [[John W. Snow]] in October 2004. The CCAC advises the secretary on issues relating to commemorative coin design and circulation. He was recommended by U.S. House Representative [[Dennis Hastert]]. He resigned in May 2005.

== Legal troubles ==
Noe has been convicted in two separate, but overlapping investigations for a variety of corrupt activities in Ohio and in national politics.

=== Campaign contributions ===
On October 27, 2005, Noe was indicted in a federal investigation on counts of conspiracy, conduit contribution violations, and false statements.

Noe was accused of illegally funneling $45,400 to President Bush's re-election campaign, using "two dozen people as "conduits" to make illegal campaign contributions at a $2,000-a-seat fund-raiser in Columbus. Conduits named in a federal affidavit include Lucas County Commissioner Maggie Thurber, Toledo City Councilwoman Betty Shultz, former Toledo Mayor Donna Owens and former State Representative Sally Perz. In doing so, Noe skirted federal campaign finance funding limits while meeting a pledge to raise $50,000 for the October 30, 2003, fund-raiser. The Bush campaign later named Noe a "[[Bush Pioneer|Pioneer]]" for raising at least $100,000 overall ... In addition to "conduits" who received between $1,750 and $4,000 from Noe to make either one or two contributions, prosecutors claim that the former rare-coin dealer used two people as "super-conduits," giving them $6,000 and $14,300 that they then split with others who attended the fund-raiser." Noe is now is serving a jail term of at least 10 years.[http://www.toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051028/NEWS24/51028001/-1/NEWS]

On October 31, 2005, Noe pled not-guilty to all three charges. On May 31, 2006, Noe reversed his earlier plea and pled guilty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/14708901.htm Coin dealer admits illegal donations] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614100224/http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/14708901.htm |date=2006-06-14 }}, Associated Press, May 31, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 12, 2006, Noe was sentenced to 27 months in a federal prison for funneling money into the re-election campaign of President Bush illegally.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coingate ===
{{main|Coingate scandal}}
Noe is also at the center of the Ohio [[Coingate scandal]]. On November 13, 2006, Noe was found guilty of theft, money laundering, forgery and corrupt activity, and the central charge: that he engaged in a pattern of corruption in his management of Ohio's $50 million rare-coin fund investment with the bureau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Noe guilty of 29 felony counts: Convictions include racketeering, theft, forgery | date=November 13, 2006 | url=http://toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061113/BREAKINGNEWS/311130003 | author=Mike Wilkinson and Steve Eder | publisher=Toledo Blade}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dispatch.com/2006/02/13/noeindict.pdf Noe Indictment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522221041/http://www.dispatch.com/2006/02/13/noeindict.pdf |date=2011-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 13, 2006, the [[Lucas County, Ohio|Lucas County]] District Court of Ohio indicted Noe [https://web.archive.org/web/20060223012851/http://www.columbusdispatch.com/news-story.php?story=dispatch%2F2006%2F02%2F14%2F20060214-A1-00.html], along with his business partner, Timothy LaPointe.[http://www.dispatch.com/news-story.php?story=dispatch/2006/02/14/20060214-A4-06.html]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}

The prosecution presented their case in three weeks that Noe stole $2 million for personal use; the defense argued that Noe's government contract allowed him the freedom to use the state's money however he wanted, but called no witnesses. The jury deliberated for three days before delivering their verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 20, 2006, Thomas Noe was given an 18-year sentence, to be served after the 27-month federal sentence imposed in September, fined $213,000, "ordered to pay the cost of the prosecution, estimated at nearly $3 million, and ordered to pay restitution to the [[Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation]] for the money missing from the rare-coin fund, estimated at $13.7 million."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |

Earlier, on August 17, 2005, Ohio Governor [[Bob Taft]] was charged with four criminal [[misdemeanors]] stemming from his failure to disclose [[golf]] outings paid for by [[lobbyists]], as well as some undisclosed gifts. The gifts were varied, but included gifts from Noe. It was the first time an Ohio governor was ever been charged with a crime while in office.[http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050817/NEWS01/308170017]

This '''timeline of modern American conservatism''' lists important events, developments, and occurrences which have significantly affected [[conservatism in the United States]]. With the decline of the conservative wing of the Democratic Party after 1960, the movement is most closely associated with the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] (GOP). [[Fiscal conservatism|Economic conservatives]] favor less government regulation, lower taxes, and weaker labor unions, while [[Social conservatism in the United States|social conservatives]] focus on moral issues and neoconservatives focus on democracy worldwide. Conservatives generally distrust the United Nations (UN) and Europe and, apart from the [[Libertarian Republican|libertarian wing]], favor a strong military and give enthusiastic support to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Michael T. Thomas (2007). ''American policy toward Israel: the power and limits of beliefs.'' Routledge. pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although conservatism has much older roots in American history, the modern movement began to gel in the mid–1930s when intellectuals and politicians collaborated with businessmen to oppose the liberalism of the [[New Deal]], led by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (FDR), newly energized [[Labor unions in the United States|labor unions]], and big city Democratic machines. After World War II that coalition gained strength from new philosophers and writers who developed an intellectual rationale for conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Allitt (2009). ''The Conservatives: Ideas and Personalities Throughout American History.'' Yale University Press. ch 1–6 covers the story down to 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Nixon's victory in the 1968 presidential election is often considered a realigning election in American politics. From 1932 to 1968, the Democratic Party was obviously the majority party. During that time period, the Democrats had won seven out of nine presidential elections, and their agenda gravely affected that undertaken by the Republican Eisenhower administration. The election of 1968 reversed the situation completely. The Vietnam war split the Democratic Party. White ethnics in the North and white Southerners felt the national Democratic Party had deserted them. The white South has voted Republican at the presidential level since the mid-1960s, and at the state and local level since the 1990s.

In the 1980s President [[Ronald Reagan]] solidified conservative Republican strength with [[tax cuts]], greatly increased [[Military budget of the United States|defense spending]], [[deregulation]], a policy of [[Reagan Doctrine|rolling back communism]] (rather than just containing it), a greatly strengthened military, and appeals to [[family values]] and conservative Judeo-Christian morality. His impact has led historians to call the 1980s the "[[Reagan Era]]".&lt;ref&gt;Sean Wilentz ''The Age of Reagan: A History, 1974–2008.'' (2009); John Ehrman ''The Eighties: America in the Age of Reagan.'' (2008) pp. 3–8.&lt;/ref&gt; The Reagan model remains the conservative standard for social, economic and foreign policy issues. In recent years social issues such as abortion, gun control, and [[Same-sex marriage|gay marriage]] have become important. Since 2009 the [[Tea Party Movement]] has energized conservatives at the local level against the policies made by the [[presidency of Barack Obama]], leading to a Republican landslide in 2010 and again in 2014, eventually culminating in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|election of Republican Donald Trump as president in 2016]].

==Chronology of events==
{{main|Conservatism in the United States|History of the United States Republican Party}}

===1930s===
As the nation plunges into its [[Great Depression in the United States|deepest depression ever]], Republicans and conservatives fall into disfavor in 1930, 1932, and 1934, losing more and more of their seats. Liberals (mostly Democrats with a few Republicans and independents) come to power with the [[United States presidential election, 1932|landslide 1932 election]] of liberal Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt. In his first 100 days Roosevelt pushes through a series of dramatic economic programs known as the [[New Deal]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony J. Badger (2009). ''FDR: the first hundred days''. Hilland Wang. pp. 3–22, 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The major metropolitan newspapers generally opposed the New Deal, as typified by [[William Randolph Hearst]] and his chain (Hearst had supported FDR in 1932 but parted ways in 1934.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Graham J. White|title=FDR and the Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2_HXgc4u_4C&amp;pg=PA51|year=1979|publisher=University of Chicago Press|pages=51–52|isbn=978-0226895123}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert R. McCormick]], owner of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', compared the New Deal to communism. He was also an [[America First Committee|America First]] [[isolationist]] who strongly opposed entering World War II to rescue the [[British Empire]]. McCormick also railed against the [[League of Nations]], the [[World Court]], socialism and communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Norton Smith|title=The Colonel: The Life and Legend of Robert R.

* The liberal [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL) and more leftist [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO) labor federations are both growing and both support FDR.

Harvard University Press. p. 542.&lt;/ref&gt;
;1938
* Opponents of conservatism weaken sharply. FDR's allies in the AFL and CIO battle each other; his court-packing plan is rejected; his attempt to purge the conservatives from the Democratic Party fails and strengthens them; the sharp [[recession of 1937–1938]] discredits his argument that New Deal policies would lead to full recovery.&lt;ref&gt;William E.

[[File:RobertATaft.jpg|thumb|140px|alt=photograph of|Robert A. Taft]]
* As Republican senator from Ohio (1939–53), [[Robert A. Taft]] leads the conservative opposition to liberal policies (apart from public housing and aid to education, which he supported). Taft opposed most of the New Deal, entry into World War II, NATO, and sending troops to the [[Korean War]]. He was not so much an "isolationist" as a staunch opponent of the ever-expanding powers of the White House. The growth of this power, Taft feared, would lead to dictatorship or at least spoil American democracy, [[republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] and civil virtue.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Matthews, "Robert A. Taft, the Constitution and American Foreign Policy, 1939–53," ''Journal of Contemporary History,'' July 1982, Vol. 17 Issue 3, pp. 507–22&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s===
Liberalism made major gains after the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1963, as [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] (LBJ) pushed through his liberal [[Great Society]] as well as civil rights laws. An unexpected bonanza helped conservatism in the late 1960s as liberalism came under intense attack from the [[New Left]], especially in academe. This new element, says liberal historian Michael Kazin, worked to "topple the corrupted liberal order."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kazin (1998). ''The populist persuasion: an American history.'' Cornell University Press. p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; For the New Left "liberal" became a nasty epithet. Liberal commentator [[E. J. Dionne]] finds that, "If liberal ideology began to crumble intellectually in the 1960s it did so in part because the New Left represented a highly articulate and able wrecking crew."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=E.

[[Movement conservatism]] emerges as grassroots activists react to liberal and [[New Left]] agendas. It develops a structure that supports Goldwater in 1964 and [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1976–80. By the late 1970s, local evangelical churches join the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Perlstein, "Thunder on the Right: The Roots of Conservative Victory in the 1960s," ''OAH Magazine of History,'' Oct 2006, Vol. 20 Issue 5, pp. 24–27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James A. Hijiya, "The Conservative 1960s," ''Journal of American Studies,'' Aug 2003, Vol. 37 Issue 2, pp. 201–28&lt;/ref&gt;
Liberalism faces a racial crisis nationwide. Within weeks of the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|1964 Civil Rights law]], "long hot summers" begin, lasting until 1970, with the [[Long Hot Summer of 1967|worst outbreaks coming in the summer of 1967]].

In the mid-1960s the GOP debates race and civil rights intensely. Republican liberals, led by Nelson Rockefeller, argue for a strong federal role because it was morally right and politically advantageous. Conservatives call for a more limited federal presence and discount the possibility of significant black voter support. Nixon avoids race issues in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thurber | first1 = Timothy N.  | year = 2007 | title = Goldwaterism Triumphant?

The terror attack on September 11, 2001 reorients the administration towards foreign policy and terrorism issues, providing an opportunity for neoconservatives to have a greater influence on foreign policy.

* '''1789: '''grants the states the power to set voting requirements. Generally, states limited this right to property-owning or tax-paying white males (about 6% of the population).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Expansion of Rights and Liberties - The Right of Suffrage|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters_of_freedom_13.html|website=Online Exhibit: The Charters of Freedom|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=April 21, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706144856/http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters_of_freedom_13.html|archivedate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1790:''' The [[Naturalization Act of 1790]] allows white men born outside of the United States to become citizens. However, due to the Constitution granting the states the power to set voting requirements, this Act (and its successor Act of 1795) did not automatically grant the right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~kdhist/H105-documents-web/week08/naturalization1790.html|title=naturalization laws 1790-1795|website=www.indiana.edu|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1792–1838:''' Free black males lose the right to vote in several Northern states including [[1838 Pennsylvania Loss of Voting Rights for African American Men|in Pennsylvania]] and [[History of the New Jersey State Constitution#Vote Rescinded for Women.2C non-Whites|in New Jersey]].
* '''1792–1856:''' Abolition of property qualifications for white men, from 1792 (Kentucky) to 1856 (North Carolina) during the periods of [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian]] and [[Jacksonian democracy]].&lt;ref name=NBER2005&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Stanley L.

**In the [[United States presidential election, 1820|1820 election]], there were 108,359 ballots cast. Most older states with property restrictions dropped them by the mid-1820s, except for Rhode Island, Virginia and North Carolina. No new states had property qualifications although three had adopted tax-paying qualifications – Ohio, Louisiana, and Mississippi, of which only in Louisiana were these significant and long lasting.&lt;ref&gt;[[Timeline of voting rights in the United States#refEngerman2005|Engerman]], p. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; 
**The [[United States presidential election, 1828|1828 presidential election]] was the first in which non-property-holding white males could vote in the vast majority of states. By the end of the 1820s, attitudes and state laws had shifted in favor of [[Universal manhood suffrage|universal white male suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Timeline of voting rights in the United States#refEngerman2005|Engerman]], p. 14. "Property- or tax-based qualifications were most strongly entrenched in the original thirteen states, and dramatic political battles took place at a series of prominent state constitutional conventions held during the late 1810s and 1820s."&lt;/ref&gt;
**Voter turnout soared during the 1830s, reaching about 80% of adult white male population in the [[United States presidential election, 1840|1840 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;William G. Shade, "The Second Party System". in Paul Kleppner, et al. ''Evolution of American Electoral Systems'' (1983) pp 77-111&lt;/ref&gt; 2,412,694 ballots were cast, an increase that far outstripped natural population growth, making poor voters a huge part of the electorate. There were few nations in the world that had a similar level of suffrage for white males at this time. The process was peaceful and widely supported, except in the state of Rhode Island where the [[Dorr Rebellion]] of the 1840s demonstrated that the demand for equal suffrage was broad and strong, although the subsequent reform included a significant property requirement for anyone resident but born outside of the United States. 
**The last state to abolish property qualification was North Carolina in 1856 resulting in a close approximation to [[Universal manhood suffrage|universal white male suffrage]]. However, tax-paying qualifications remained in five states in 1860 – Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Delaware and North Carolina. They survived in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island until the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refEngerman2005|Engerman]], p. 16 and 35. Table 1&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many poor whites were later disenfranchised. 
* '''1868:''' Citizenship is guaranteed to all male persons born or naturalized in the United States by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], setting the stage for future expansions to voting rights.
* '''1870:''' The [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] prevents states from denying the right to vote on grounds of "race, color, or previous condition of servitude".
** [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era]] began soon after. Former Confederate states passed [[Jim Crow laws]] and amendments to effectively [[disfranchise]] black and poor white voters through [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]]es, [[literacy tests]], [[grandfather clauses]] and other restrictions, applied in a discriminatory manner. During this period, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] generally upheld state efforts to discriminate against racial minorities; only later in the 20th century were these laws ruled unconstitutional. Black males in the Northern states could vote, but the majority of African Americans lived in the South.
* '''1887:''' Citizenship is granted to Native Americans who are willing to disassociate themselves from their tribe by the [[Dawes Act]], making them technically eligible to vote.

The '''Working Group on Financial Markets''' (also, '''President's Working Group on Financial Markets''', the '''Working Group''', and colloquially the '''Plunge Protection Team''') was created by  [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] 12631,&lt;ref name="EO12631"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/12631.html|title=Executive Orders|author=|date=March 18, 1988|publication-date=August 15, 2016|publisher=| accessdate=August 10, 2018}}, which appears and purports to be a copy of the original:   {{cite journal |url= https://www.loc.gov/item/fr053055/ |journal=Federal Register |volume= 53 |issue=55| page= 9421 |title= Executive Order 12631 of March 18 1988: Working Group on Financial Markets  |author= National Archives And Records Administration |date=March 18, 1988|publication-date=March 22, 1988|publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |accessdate=August 10, 2018 |id=FR Doc. 88-6380}}&lt;/ref&gt; signed on March 18, 1988, by [[United States]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]].

As established by the executive order, the Working Group has three purposes and functions:

"(a) Recognizing the goals of enhancing the integrity, efficiency, orderliness, and competitiveness of our Nation's financial markets and maintaining investor confidence, the Working Group shall identify and consider: 
:(1) the major issues raised by the numerous studies on the events in the financial markets surrounding [[Black Monday (1987)|October 19, 1987]], and any of those recommendations that have the potential to achieve the goals noted above; and 
:(2) the actions, including governmental actions under existing laws and regulations (such as policy coordination and contingency planning), that are appropriate to carry out these recommendations. 
(b) The Working Group shall consult, as appropriate, with representatives of the various exchanges, clearinghouses, self-regulatory bodies, and with major market participants to determine private sector solutions wherever possible.&lt;br /&gt;
(c) The Working Group shall report to the President initially within 60 days (and periodically thereafter) on its progress and, if appropriate, its views on any recommended legislative changes."&lt;ref name="EO12631"/&gt;

The Working Group consists of: 
* The [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]], or his or her designee (as Chairperson of the Working Group); 
* The Chairperson of the [[Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System]], or his or her designee; 
* The Chairperson of the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], or his or her designee; and 
* The Chairperson of the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]], or his or her designee.

==Plunge Protection Team==
"Plunge Protection Team" was originally the headline for an article in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' on February 23, 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/business/longterm/blackm/plunge.htm | work=The Washington Post | author= | date=February 23, 1997 | title=Plunge Protection Team | access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since been used by some as an informal term to refer to the Working Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url-access=subscription |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;grid=&amp;xml=/money/2006/10/30/ccview30.xml|title=Monday view: Paulson re-activates secretive support team to prevent markets meltdown|last=Evans-Pritchard|first=Ambrose|date=October 30, 2006|publisher=Telegraph UK|access-date=September 15, 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4258005,00.html|title=Fed to prop up Wall St|last=Wachman|first=Richard|author2=Jamie Doward Observer |date=2001-09-16|publisher=Guardian Unlimited|access-date=September 15, 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the term was used to express the opinion that the Working Group was being used to prop up the [[stock market]]s during downturns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/business/longterm/blackm/plunge.htm|title=Plunge Protection Team |last=Fromson|first=Brett.

He stated that "If the money to boost stock prices did not come from the traditional players, it had to have come from somewhere else" and "Why not support the stock market as well? Moreover, several officials have suggested the government should support stock prices."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.moneynews.com/StreetTalk/CharlesBiderman-Fed-government-Rigging/2010/01/06/id/345497|title=Biderman: Fed, Gov't Likely Rigging Market Rally|last=Crawshaw |first=Julie|date=2010-01-10|publisher=Money News|access-date=April 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, Sprott Asset Management released a report that argued that there is little doubt that the PPT intervened to protect the stock market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sprott.com/Docs/SpecialReports/08_2005_TheVisibleHand.pdf|title=Sprott Asset Management|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=November 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, these articles usually refer to the Working Group using moral suasion to attempt to convince banks to buy stock index futures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://registeredrep.com/mag/finance_stock_markets_da/ Federal Government Manipulating Equities Market?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Federal Reserve Board member Robert Heller, in the ''Wall Street Journal'', opined that "Instead of flooding the entire economy with liquidity, and thereby increasing the danger of inflation, the Fed could support the stock market directly by buying market averages in the futures market, thereby stabilizing the market as a whole." {{Citation needed span|date=August 2018|text=His statement has been used to claim that the Fed actually did act in that way.}} Some{{who|date=May 2014}} mainstream analysts call those claims a [[conspiracy theory]], explaining that such claims are simplistic and unworkable.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, ''The Boston Globe''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=August 2018}} Author [[Kevin Phillips (political commentator)|Kevin Phillips]] wrote in his 2008 book ''Bad Money'' that while he had no interest "in becoming a conspiracy investigator", he nevertheless drew the conclusion that "some kind of high-level decision seems to have been reached in Washington to loosely institutionalize a rescue mechanism for the stock market akin to that pursued...to safeguard major U.S. banks from exposure to domestic and foreign loan and currency crises."&lt;ref name="Phillips 2008"&gt;{{Cite book| last=Phillips | first=K. | year=2008 | title=Bad Money: Reckless Finance, Failed Politics, and the Global Crisis of American Capitalism | publisher=Viking | isbn=978-0-670-01907-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phillips infers that the simplest way for the Working Group to intervene in market plunges would be through buying [[stock market index]] [[futures contracts]], either in cooperation with major banks or through [[trading room|trading desks]] at the U.S. Treasury or Federal Reserve.&lt;ref name="Phillips 2008"/&gt;

==Market crisis of 2008==
On October 6, 2008, the working group issued a statement indicating that it was taking multiple actions available to it in order to attempt to stabilize the financial system, although purchase of stock shares was not part of the statement.&lt;ref name="October_statment"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/hp1177.aspx|title=Statement by the President's Working Group on Financial Markets|publisher=[[United States Department of the Treasury]]|access-date=October 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government may wind up owning shares in the firms to which it provided loans, as they will receive warrants as collateral for these loans.
