{{Year nav topic5|1952|radio|television|music|film}}

The year '''1952 in [[radio]]''' involved some significant events.
__TOC__

==Events==
*4 March: The Courier, the first seagoing radio station, is dedicated by president [[Harry Truman]].
*21 March: The [[Moondog Coronation Ball]] is hosted by star deejay [[Alan Freed]] and WJW (AM) in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] (now [[WKNR]]) at the [[Cleveland Arena]]. Among those scheduled to perform at the event were [[Paul Williams (saxophonist)|Paul Williams and the Hucklebuckers]], [[The Dominoes]], [[Varetta Dillard]] and [[Tiny Grimes]], but only the Hucklebuckers are able to perform before the concert is shut down by officials.  So many tickets were counterfeited that the 12,500 seat Arena now had ''25,000'' people in attendance, alarming Cleveland Police Capt. William Zimmerman, who stopped the show. A near riot ensues when close to 7,000 additional fans, unable to buy tickets, rush the gates and storm into the arena. Freed and WJW gain national attention and prestige, and the event is now universally recognized as the first [[rock 'n roll]] concert.

The year '''1993 in radio''' involved some significant events.

==Events==
*January: The [[Media in the Quad Cities|Quad Cities]]' KSTT call letters are retired as 1170 AM is given the new call sign KJOC, reflecting that station's all-sports format. The station had been simulcasting [[WXLP]]'s FM signal for the past four years, although its sports programming had been steadily increasing during that time. Also that month, [[WPAT (AM)|WPAT]] and [[WPAT-FM]] [[Paterson, NJ]]/[[New York City]] quietly completed their evolution from [[Beautiful Music]] to down-tempo [[Adult Contemporary]], still known as Easy 93.
*4 January - [[WYCD|WOWF]]/Detroit officially completes their flip from Top 40/CHR to [[talk radio|talk]] as "Wow FM."
*6 January - After 5 days of [[stunting (broadcasting)|stunting]] with all-[[Garth Brooks]] music, Rhythmic CHR-formatted [[WBZZ|WMXP]]/Pittsburgh flips to country as "K-Bear", WKQB.
*10 January - [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] gets its second local country outlet when [[KKSE-FM|KDHT]] completed its move-in to the market and flipped to "Big Dog 92.5."
*15 January - KONC/Phoenix flips from classical to modern rock. A few weeks later, on 1 February, cross-town rival KFMA flips to beautiful music.
*25 January - After stunting with all-[[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] music for 3 days, Top 40/CHR-formatted [[KRVB|KFXD-FM]]/[[Boise, Idaho|Boise]] flips to adult contemporary.
*26 January - [[Toronto]] got its first country-formatted FM station when [[CKIS-FM|CISS-FM]] signed on the air.
*February - KZKZ/[[Ft. Smith, Arkansas|Ft. Smith]] flips from album rock to gospel, while KTEZ/[[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]] flips from beautiful music to country.
*2 February - Pittsburgh picked up its third country outlet, as [[WPGB|WORD-FM]]'s former 104.7 frequency flips from religious programming and became "Rebel 104.7", WXRB.
*5 February - [[WLFP|WODZ]]/Memphis flips from oldies to country as "Froggy 94", WOGY. Also on this day, Top 40/CHR-formatted [[KMJK|KXXR]]/Kansas City changes call letters and rebrands as KISF, "Kiss 107.3."
*7 February - [[KKSW|KLZR]]/[[Lawrence, Kansas]] flips from satellite-fed Hot AC to modern rock
*15 February - WXQL/Jacksonville flips to Urban AC
*19 February:  [[KBEQ]]/Kansas City drops its top-40 format of 20 years as "Q-104" to go country as "Young Country 104."  It would initially be simulcast on KBZR 1030, which had been airing [[Z-Rock]].  The "Q-104" handle would return a few years later, but the format would remain country.
*March: After 40-plus years in its hometown, [[KBEA-FM|KFMH]] (99.7 FM) moves its studios from [[Muscatine, Iowa]] to [[Davenport, Iowa|Davenport]]. Also that month, Cleveland-based Malrite Communications announces it will merge with Shamrock Broadcasting. The merger would be completed in August.
*8 March - KKNB/[[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]] signs on with a modern rock format.
*12 March: After 10 years in the Top 40/CHR format (with a few moniker and format modifications]], WEGX/[[Philadelphia]] becomes [[smooth jazz]]-formatted [[WISX|WJJZ]]. Three days later, struggling [[adult contemporary|AC]] [[WRNB|WKSZ]] fills the format void by flipping to "Z100." However, due to the presence of nearby [[WHTZ]] in New York (which is also located on 100.3 FM), the "Z100" moniker would be modified to "Y100".
*2 April: After 20 years as an influential [[Top 40]] station, [[WRBQ-FM]]/[[Tampa]] flipped to [[country music|country]], while keeping its heritage "Q105" moniker. Also on this day, [[KKLQ (FM)|KQLZ]]/[[Los Angeles]] (the former "[[KQLZ (defunct)|Pirate Radio]]") flipped from modern rock to [[Adult contemporary|Soft AC]] as "EZ 100.3" after [[Westwood One (1976–2011)|Westwood One]] sold the station to [[Viacom, Inc.|Viacom]]. In addition, [[KCMQ]]/[[Columbia, Missouri|Columbia]] flips from Top 40/CHR to country.
*5 April - Two stations in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] would flip to country within two days of each other: [[Beautiful Music]]-formatted [[WWHT|WRHP]] flips on the 5th, while classic rock-formatted [[WBBS|WKFM]] flips the next day. In [[Akron, Ohio]], [[Hot AC]]-formatted [[WQMX]] would also flip to country on the 5th.
*19 April - WAQZ/Cincinnati flips from album rock to modern rock
*30 April: [[Virgin Radio]], originally called Virgin 1215, was launched nationally in the United Kingdom on 1215&amp;nbsp;kHz at 12.15pm by [[Richard Branson]]. It has since become the most listened to online radio station in the world.
*11 May: [[Contemporary hit radio|CHR]]-formatted [[WJMN (FM)|WZOU]]/[[Boston]] shifted to [[Rhythmic CHR]] as "JAM'N 94.5", WJMN.

*3 June: Atlantic Ventures, Stoner Broadcasting and Multi Market Communications all merge to form American Radio Systems, consisting of 16 stations in 7 markets.
*9 September:  Cox and CBS make a swap involving the Dallas and Tampa radio markets. Cox received AOR WYNF 94.9 "95 YNF" in Tampa from CBS to pair with its WWRM "Warm 107.3", while CBS received KLRX "Lite 97.9" in Dallas from Cox to pair with its KTXQ "Q-102."  KLRX flipped to classic rock as KRRW "Arrow 97.9" on 15 October (becoming the second station to use that branding), while Cox moved the "Warm" format from 107.3 to 94.9 and launches 1970s hits WCOF "107.3 The Coast."
*10 September - CBS installs the very first 70s-based [[classic hits]]-formatted "[[Arrow (radio format)|Arrow]]" station on [[KCBS-FM]]/Los Angeles, who dropped their 4-year old [[oldies]] format.
*22 September - [[WMVP|WLUP-AM]]/Chicago moves their comedy/talk programming over to [[WCKL-FM|their FM sister station]], and flips to [[sports talk]] as WMVP.
*October - Memphis got its sixth urban-formatted station when WOGY-AM dropped the simulcast with [[WLFP|its FM sister station]] and flipped to urban oldies as "The Juice", WJCE. Also this month, Carl Hirsch launches his new radio group venture, OmniAmerica Communications.
*11 October - Westwood One announced it would acquire Unistar Radio Networks for $101.3 million; in addition, Westwood One would sell a 25% equity stake to [[Infinity Broadcasting]] for $15 million. Also on this day, KPOI/Honolulu flips from album rock to modern rock.
*25 October - [[Smooth jazz]]-formatted [[KRKS-FM|KHIH]]/Denver flips to religious programming; the format void would be filled by AC-formatted [[KPTT|KHOW-FM]] a few days later.
*November - [[WXDX-FM|WWKS]]/Pittsburgh flips from classic rock to hard rock. Also during this month, Booth American Company and Broadcast Alchemy announced plans of a merger, with the newly combined company getting 11 stations in 7 markets and $160 million. In addition, Metroplex Communications would merge with Clear Channel, a deal worth $53 million.
*10 November - KQBR/Sacramento dropped country for [[smooth jazz]]
*12 November - After 23 years in the country format, [[KLAC]]/Los Angeles flips to Unistar's [[adult standards]] "AM Only" format.
*15 November - Top 40/CHR-formatted WYAV/Myrtle Beach flips to [[classic rock]], and became an affiliate of [[The Howard Stern Show]].
*19 November - The "Arrow" format is expanded to two adult contemporary-formatted stations in two markets; in Washington, D.C., [[WIAD|WLTT]] adopts the format, while in Houston, [[KQBT|KLTR]] flips to the format four days later.
*16 December - [[96WEFM]] begins broadcasting in [[Trinidad and Tobago]].

The World Monuments Watch is a flagship advocacy program of the New York-based private non-profit organization [[World Monuments Fund]] (WMF) and [[American Express]] to call upon every government in the world, preservation organizations, and other groups and individuals to nominate sites and monuments that are particularly endangered. At the same time, the nominators commit themselves to participate in a carefully planned [[Historic preservation|preservation]] project.&lt;ref name=insight /&gt;

==Selection process==
Every two years, the program publishes a select list known as the Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites that is in urgent need of preservation funding and protection. The sites are chosen from these nominations by an independent panel of international experts, based on the significance of the site, the urgency of the problem, and the viability of the proposal for action.&lt;ref name=insight&gt;{{cite web | title = Insight: The World's Most Endangered Sites | url = http://www.archaeology.org/9911/etc/insight.html | date=November–December 1999 | author=James Wiseman | accessdate=8 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; WMF would then publicize their plight and help find the resources and expertise to carry out the preservation projects for the 100 sites on the Watch List.&lt;ref name=insight /&gt; The leverage from the listing also spurs government agencies and local donors to allocate funds and take an active role in protecting the cultural landmark,&lt;ref name=1998_press_release /&gt; in addition to grants directly coming from WMF and American Express.

==2000 Watch List==
The 2000 World Monuments Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites was launched on 14 September 1999 by WMF President Bonnie Burnham.&lt;ref name=1998_press_release&gt;{{cite web | title = Palpung named to list of endangered monuments | publisher = World Monuments Fund | date=September 1997 | url = http://www.asianart.com/cers/palpung/palpwmw.html|accessdate=8 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=1998_official&gt;{{cite web | title = 1998 World Monuments Watch | publisher = World Monuments Fund | url = http://www.wmf.org/pdf/Watch_Catalog_1998.pdf|accessdate=8 September 2009}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=[World Monuments] Watch is a bold challenge to local and national authorities to step up to their responsibilities—and an appeal to the public to take immediate action—to save these irreplaceable sites that define the history and the humanity of the peoples of the world[…] Once these sites are lost, they are gone forever. They are the very definition of the word irreplaceable.|sign=Bonnie Burnham, WMF president|source=launch of 2000 Watch List&lt;ref name=insight /&gt;}}

The year '''564 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. In the [[Roman Empire]], it was known as '''year 190 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''. The denomination 564 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

[[Image:PriestleyChart.gif|thumb|right|320px|A redacted version of Priestley's ''Chart of Biography'' (1765)]]
In 1765, 18th-century British [[polymath]] [[Joseph Priestley]] published '''''A Chart of Biography''''' and its accompanying prose description as a supplement to his ''[[Lectures on History and General Policy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''A Chart of Biography''. London: J. Johnson, St. Paul's Church Yard, 1765 and Joseph Priestley, ''A description of a chart of biography''. [Warrington] : Printed at Warrington, 1764; ''A Description of a Chart of Biography''. Warrington: Printed by William Eyres, 1765.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley believed that the chart and ''[[A New Chart of History]]'' (1769) would allow students to "trace out distinctly the dependence of events to distribute them into such periods and divisions as shall lay the whole claim of past transactions in a just and orderly manner."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Sheps, 141-2.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Chart of Biography'' covers a vast timespan, from 1200 BC to 1800 AD, and includes two thousand names. Priestley organized his list into six categories: Statesman and Warriors; Divines and Metaphysicians; Mathematicians and Physicians (natural philosophers were placed here); Poets and Artists; Orators and Critics (prose fiction authors were placed here); and Historians and Antiquarians (lawyers were placed here). Priestley's "principle of selection" was fame, not merit; therefore, as he mentions, the chart is a reflection of current opinion. He also wanted to ensure that his readers would recognize the entires on the chart. Priestley had difficulty assigning all of the people listed to individual categories; he attempted to list them in the category under which their most important work had been done. [[Machiavelli]] is therefore listed as a historian rather than a statesman and [[Cicero]] is listed as a statesman instead of an orator. The chart was also arranged in order of importance; "statesmen are placed on the lower margin, where they are easier to see, because they are the names most familiar to readers."&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLachlan, 253; Sheps, 142-5.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Both ''Charts'' were popular for decades—the ''[[A New Chart of History]]'' went through fifteen editions by 1816.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The trustees of Warrington were so impressed with Priestley's lectures and charts that they arranged for the [[University of Edinburgh]] to grant him a [[Doctor of Laws|Doctor of Law degree]] in 1764.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, 118-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2210">'''Aboiteau''' farming on reclaimed [[marshland]] is a [[labor-intensive]] method in which earthen [[Levee|dyke]]s are constructed to stop high tides from inundating marshland.  A wooden [[sluice]] or aboiteau (plural aboiteaux) is then built into the dyke, with a hinged door (clapper valve) that swings open at [[low tide]] to allow fresh water to drain from the farmland but swings shut at [[high tide]] to prevent [[Seawater|salt water]] from inundating the fields.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metronews.ca/halifax/local/article/90160 "More funding for shifting aboiteau" - Metro News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605062437/http://www.metronews.ca/halifax/local/article/90160 |date=June 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amherstdaily.com/Construction-real-estate/2007-08-14/article-384737/Excavation-uncovers-Acadian-aboiteau/1 "Excavation uncovers Acadian aboiteau" - Amherst Daily News]&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboiteau farming is intimately linked with the story of [[Acadians|French Acadian]] colonization of the shores of Canada's [[Bay of Fundy]] in the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Hatvany, MG "The Origins of the Acadian Aboiteau: An Environmental Historical Geography," Historical Geography, 30 (2002): 121-137.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Kamouraska, Quebec|Kamouraska region]] of the [[St. Lawrence Valley]] of Quebec, aboiteau diking of salt marshes was closely tied to the modernization of agriculture in the 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Hatvany, MG Marshlands: Four Centuries of Environmental Change on the Shores of the St. Lawrence (Québec: Les Presses de l'Université Laval, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; The Acadians constructed earthen dykes to isolate areas of salt marsh from repeated inundation by the tides.

A rare original "aboiteau" is the jewel of the West Pubnico Acadian Museums' artifacts.   In 1990, local residents found a couple of boards sticking out of an eroding beach on Double Island, West Pubnico.  They returned to the site in 1996 to remove the aboiteau, to preserve and display it at the museum.&lt;ref&gt;Musée des Acadiens des Pubnicos et Centre de recherche&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Annales'' school}} 
The '''''Annales'' school''' ({{IPA-fr|a'nal}}) is a group of historians associated with a style of [[historiography]] developed by French [[historians]] in the 20th century to stress long-term [[social history]]. It is named after its scholarly journal ''[[Annales d'histoire économique et sociale]]'', which remains the main source of scholarship, along with many books and monographs.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.editions.ehess.fr/revues/annales-histoire-sciences-sociales/numeros-parus/ for recent issues]&lt;/ref&gt; The school has been highly influential in setting the agenda for historiography in France and numerous other countries, especially regarding the use of [[social science|social scientific]] methods by historians, emphasizing social rather than political or diplomatic themes, and for being generally hostile to the class analysis of [[Marxist historiography]].

The school deals primarily with [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval]] and [[Early modern period|early modern]] Europe (before the [[French Revolution]]), with little interest in later topics. It has dominated French social history and influenced historiography in Europe and Latin America. Prominent leaders include co-founders [[Lucien Febvre]] (1878–1956), [[Henri Hauser]] (1866-1946) and [[Marc Bloch]] (1886–1944).  The second generation was led by [[Fernand Braudel]] (1902–1985) and included [[Georges Duby]] (1919–1996), [[Pierre Goubert]] (1915–2012), [[Robert Mandrou]] (1921–1984), [[Pierre Chaunu]] (1923–2009), [[Jacques Le Goff]] (1924–2014), and [[Ernest Labrousse]] (1895–1988). Institutionally it is based on the ''Annales'' journal, the SEVPEN publishing house, the {{Lang|fr|Fondation Maison des sciences de l'homme}} (FMSH), and especially the 6th Section of the [[École pratique des hautes études]], all based in Paris.  A third generation was led by [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]] (1929– ) and includes Jacques Revel,&lt;ref&gt;Since 1978, Revel has taught at the [[École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]] (Paris), where he is ''directeur d'études'' (full professor); he served as president of the École from 1995 to 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Philippe Ariès]] (1914–1984), who joined the group in 1978.  The third generation stressed [[History of mentalities|history from the point of view of mentalities]], or ''mentalités''.  The fourth generation of Annales historians, led by [[Roger Chartier]] (1945– ), clearly distanced itself from the mentalities approach, replaced by the [[Cultural turn|cultural]] and [[linguistic turn]], which emphasize analysis of the social history of cultural practices.
  
The main scholarly outlet has been the journal ''Annales d'Histoire Economique et Sociale'' ("Annals of Economic and Social History"), founded in 1929 by Lucien Febvre and Marc Bloch, which broke radically with traditional historiography by insisting on the importance of taking all levels of society into consideration and emphasized the collective nature of mentalities. Its contributors viewed events as less fundamental than the mental frameworks that shaped decisions and practices
Janmesh Kokate was editor of ''Annales committee '' from 2003 to present, followed by the medievalist Jacques Le Goff. However,  informal successor as head of the school was Le Roy Ladurie. Noting the political upheavals in Europe and especially in France in 1968, [[Eric Hobsbawm]] argues that "in France the virtual hegemony of Braudelian history and the ''Annales'' came to an end after 1968, and the international influence of the journal dropped steeply."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric J. Hobsbawm|title=Interesting Times: A Twentieth-century Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VBQqAAAAYAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Pantheon Books|page=295|isbn=9780375422348}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Multiple responses were attempted by the school. Scholars moved in multiple directions, covering in disconnected fashion the social, economic, and cultural history of different eras and different parts of the globe. By the time of crisis the school was building a vast publishing and research network reaching across France, Europe, and the rest of the world. Influence indeed spread out from Paris, but few new ideas came in. Much emphasis was given to quantitative data, seen as the key to unlocking all of social history.&lt;ref&gt;One of numerous spin-off journals was ''Histoire &amp; mesure'' (1986– ), devoted to quantitative history.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Annales ignored the developments in quantitative studies underway in the U.S. and Britain, which reshaped economic, political, and demographic research.&lt;ref&gt;Georg G. Iggers, ''Historiography in the Twentieth Century: From Scientific Objectivity to the Postmodern Challenge," 59–61.&lt;/ref&gt;  An attempt to require an ''Annales''-written textbook for French schools was rejected by the government.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; By 1980 [[postmodern]] sensibilities undercut confidence in overarching metanarratives. As [[Jacques Revel]] notes, the success of the Annales School, especially its use of social structures as explanatory forces, contained the seeds of its own downfall, for there is "no longer any implicit consensus on which to base the unity of the social, identified with the real."&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Revel and Lynn Hunt, "Microanalysis and the Construction of the Social," in ''Histories: French Constructions of the Past,'' ed. by Jacques Revel and Lynn Hunt (1995) 480.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Annales School kept its infrastructure, but lost its ''mentalités''.&lt;ref&gt;On the decline of Annales, see Hunt (1986); for a summary of the movement see Burke, ''French Historical Revolution'', 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The journal==
{{main article|Annales d'histoire économique et sociale}}
The journal began in Strasbourg as ''Annales d'histoire économique et sociale''; it moved to Paris and kept the same name from 1929 to 1939. It was successively renamed ''Annales d'histoire sociale'' (1939–1942, 1945), ''Mélanges d'histoire sociale'' (1942–1944), ''Annales. Economies, sociétés, civilisations'' (1946–1994), and ''Annales. Histoire, Sciences Sociales'' (1994– ).&lt;ref name="journal names"&gt;P. Burke, ''The French Historical Revolution. The Annales School 1929–89'', p. 116 n. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 Braudel and Gaston Berger used Ford Foundation money and government funds to create a new independent foundation, the {{Lang|fr|Fondation Maison des sciences de l'homme}} (FMSH), which Braudel directed from 1970 until his death. In 1970 the 6th Section and the ''Annales'' relocated to the FMSH building.  FMSH set up elaborate international networks to spread the ''Annales'' gospel across Europe and the world. In 2013 it began publication of an English language edition, with all the articles translated.

The scope of topics covered by the journal is vast and experimental—there is a search for total history and new approaches. The emphasis is on social history, and very long-term trends, often using quantification and paying special attention to geography&lt;ref&gt;See Lucien Febvre, ''La Terre et l'évolution humaine'' (1922), translated as ''A Geographical Introduction to History'' (London, 1932).&lt;/ref&gt; and to the intellectual world view of common people, or "mentality" (''mentalité''). Little attention is paid to political, diplomatic, or military history, or to biographies of famous men.  Instead the ''Annales'' focused attention on the synthesizing of historical patterns identified from social, economic, and cultural history, statistics, medical reports, family studies, and even psychoanalysis.

==Origins==
The ''Annales'' was founded and edited by [[Marc Bloch]] and [[Lucien Febvre]] in 1929, while they were teaching at the [[University of Strasbourg]] and later in Paris. These authors, the former a medieval historian and the latter an early modernist, quickly became associated with the distinctive ''Annales'' approach, which combined geography, history, and the sociological approaches of the ''[[Année Sociologique]]'' (many members of which were their colleagues at Strasbourg) to produce an approach which rejected the predominant emphasis on politics, diplomacy and war of many 19th and early 20th-century historians as spearheaded by historians whom Febvre called Les Sorbonnistes. Instead, they pioneered an approach to a study of long-term historical structures (''la [[longue durée]]'') over events and political transformations.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Jones, "Olwen Hufton's 'Poor', Richard Cobb's 'People', and the Notions of the longue durée in French Revolutionary Historiography," ''Past &amp; Present,'' 2006 Supplement (Volume 1), pp. 178–203 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/past_and_present/v2006/2006.1Sjones.html in Project Muse]&lt;/ref&gt;  Geography, material culture, and what later Annalistes called ''mentalités,'' or the psychology of the epoch, are also characteristic areas of study. The goal of the Annales was to undo the work of the Sorbonnistes, to turn French historians away from the narrowly political and diplomatic toward the new vistas in social and economic history.&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Hexter, "Fernand Braudel and the Monde Braudellien," '' Historians,'' pp. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Co-founder [[Marc Bloch]] (1886–1944) was a quintessential modernist who studied at the elite École Normale Supérieure, and in Germany, serving as a professor at the University of Strasbourg until he was called to the Sorbonne in Paris in 1936 as professor of economic history.  Bloch's interests were  highly interdisciplinary, influenced by the geography of [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]] (1845–1918)&lt;ref&gt;Jason Hilkovitch &amp; Max Fulkerson, "Paul Vidal de la Blache: A biographical sketch" at

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the sociology of [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917).  His own ideas, especially those expressed in his masterworks, ''French Rural History'' (''Les caractères originaux de l'histoire rurale française,'' 1931) and ''Feudal Society'', were incorporated by the second-generation Annalistes, led by [[Fernand Braudel]].

==Precepts==
[[Georges Duby]], a leader of the school, wrote that the history he taught:
:relegated the sensational to the sidelines and was reluctant to give a simple accounting of events, but strived on the contrary to pose and solve problems and, neglecting surface disturbances, to observe the long and medium-term evolution of economy, society and civilisation.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Duby, ''Le dimanche de Bouvines'' (1973), forward&lt;/ref&gt;
The Annalistes, especially [[Lucien Febvre]], advocated a ''histoire totale'', or ''histoire tout court'', a complete study of a historic problem.

==Postwar==
Bloch was shot by the [[Gestapo]] during the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupation of France]] in World War II for his active membership of the [[French Resistance]], and Febvre carried on the ''Annales'' approach in the 1940s and 1950s. It was during this time that he mentored Braudel, who would become one of the best-known exponents of this school. Braudel's work came to define a "second" era of ''Annales'' historiography and was very influential throughout the 1960s and 1970s, especially for his work on the Mediterranean region in the era of [[Philip II of Spain]]. 
Braudel developed the idea, often associated with Annalistes, of different modes of historical time: ''l'histoire quasi immobile'' (the quasi motionless history) of historical geography, the history of social, political and economic structures (''la [[longue durée]]''), and the history of men and events, in the context of their structures.

While authors such as [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]], [[Marc Ferro]] and [[Jacques Le Goff]] continue to carry the ''Annales'' banner, today the ''Annales'' approach has been less distinctive as more and more historians do work in [[cultural history]], [[political history]] and [[economic history]].

==''Mentalités''==
Bloch's ''Les Rois Thaumaturges'' (1924)&lt;ref&gt;Translated as ''The Royal Touch: Monarchy and Miracles in France and England'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; looked at the long-standing folk belief that the king could cure [[scrofula]] by his [[royal touch|thaumaturgic touch]].  The kings of France and England indeed regularly practiced the ritual.  Bloch was not concerned with the effectiveness of the royal touch—he acted instead like an anthropologist in asking why people believed it and how it shaped relations between king and commoner. The book was highly influential in introducing comparative studies (in this case France and England), as well as long durations ("longue durée") studies spanning several centuries, even up to a thousand years, downplaying short-term events.  Bloch's revolutionary charting of mentalities, or ''mentalités'', resonated with scholars who were reading [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] and [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]. In the 1960s, [[Robert Mandrou]] and [[Georges Duby]] harmonized the concept of ''mentalité'' history with [[Fernand Braudel]]'s structures of historical time and linked mentalities with changing social conditions. A flood of ''mentalité'' studies based on these approaches appeared during the 1970s and 1980s. By the 1990s, however, ''mentalité'' history had become interdisciplinary to the point of fragmentation, but still lacked a solid theoretical basis. While not explicitly rejecting ''mentalité'' history, younger historians increasingly turned to other approaches.

==Braudel==
Fernand Braudel became the leader of the second generation after 1945. He obtained funding from the Rockefeller Foundation in New York and founded the 6th Section of the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, which was devoted to the study of history and the social sciences.  It became an independent degree-granting institution in 1975 under the name [[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences|École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]] (EHESS).  Braudel's followers admired his use of the longue durée approach to stress slow, and often imperceptible effects of space, climate and technology on the actions of human beings in the past.  The ''Annales'' historians, after living through two world wars and incredible political upheavals in France, were deeply uncomfortable with the notion that multiple ruptures and discontinuities created history. They preferred to stress inertia and the longue durée. Special attention was paid to geography, climate, and demography as long-term factors. They believed the continuities of the deepest structures were central to history, beside which upheavals in institutions or the superstructure of social life were of little significance, for history lies beyond the reach of conscious actors, especially the will of revolutionaries. They rejected the Marxist idea that history should be used as a tool to foment and foster revolutions. In turn the Marxists called them conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;Olivia Harris, "Braudel: Historical Time and the Horror of Discontinuity." ''History Workshop Journal'' (2004) (57): 161–174. {{ISSN|1363-3554}} Fulltext: [[OUP]]. Only Ariès was a true conservative—indeed a royalist.&lt;/ref&gt;

Braudel's first book, ''La Méditerranée et le Monde Méditerranéen à l'Epoque de Philippe II'' (1949) (''The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II'') was his most influential.  This vast panoramic view used ideas from other social sciences, employed effectively the technique of the longue durée, and downplayed the importance of specific events and individuals.  It stressed geography but not ''mentalité''. It was widely admired, but most historians did not try to replicate it and instead focused on their specialized monographs. The book dramatically raised the worldwide profile of the Annales School.

==Regionalism==
Before ''Annales,'' French history supposedly happened in Paris. Febvre broke decisively with this paradigm in 1912, with his sweeping doctoral thesis on ''[[Philip II of Spain|Philippe II]] et la [[Franche-Comté]].'' The geography and social structure of this region overwhelmed and shaped the king's policies.

The ''Annales'' historians did not try to replicate Braudel's vast geographical scope in ''La Méditerranée.'' Instead they focused on regions in France over long stretches of time. The most important was the study of the ''Peasants of Languedoc'' by Braudel's star pupil and successor Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie.&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, ''The Peasants of Languedoc,'' (1966, translated 1977) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0252006356 excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;  The regionalist tradition flourished especially in the 1960s and 1970s in the work of Pierre Goubert in 1960 on Beauvais and René Baehrel on Basse-Provence. ''Annales'' historians in the 1970s and 1980s turned to urban regions, including Pierre Deyon (Amiens), Maurice Garden (Lyon), Jean-Pierre Bardet (Rouen), Georges Freche (Toulouse), and Jean-Claude Perrot (Caen). By the 1970s the shift was underway from the earlier economic history to cultural history and the history of mentalities.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Hinrichs, "Provinzen, Landschaften, Regionen in Der Modernen Französischen Geschichtswissenschaft – Ein Essay," ''Blätter Für Deutsche Landesgeschichte'' 1994 130: 1–12. {{ISSN|0006-4408}} Fulltext: [http://periodika.digitale-sammlungen.de/bdlg/Blatt_bsb00000334,00007.html online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact outside France==
The ''Annales'' school systematically reached out to create an impact on other countries.  Its success varied widely.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, ''French Historical Revolution'' (1990) ch 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Annales'' approach was especially well received in [[Italy]] and [[Poland]]. [[Franciszek Bujak]] (1875–1953) and [[Jan Rutkowski]] (1886–1949), the founders of modern economic history in Poland and of the journal ''Roczniki Dziejów Spolecznych i Gospodarczych'' (1931– ), were attracted to the innovations of the Annales school. Rutkowski was in contact with Bloch and others, and published in the ''Annales.'' After the Communists took control in the 1940s Polish scholars were safer working on the Middle Ages and the early modern era rather than contemporary history. After the "[[Polish October]]" of 1956 the Sixth Section in Paris welcomed Polish historians and exchanges between the circle of the ''Annales'' and Polish scholars continued until the early 1980s. The reciprocal influence between the French school and Polish historiography was particularly evident in studies on the Middle Ages and the early modern era studied by Braudel.&lt;ref&gt;Anita Krystyna Shelton, ''The Democratic Idea in Polish History and Historiography'' (1989). Even the Marxist journal ''Kwartalnik Historii Kultury Materialnej,'' founded in 1953, had an ''Annales'' flavor.&lt;/ref&gt;

In South America the ''Annales'' approach became popular. From the 1950s [[Federico Brito Figueroa]] was the founder of a new Venezuelan historiography based largely on the ideas of the Annales School. Brito Figueroa carried his conception of the field to all levels of university study, emphasizing a systematic and scientific approach to history and placing it squarely in the social sciences.  Spanish historiography was influenced by the "Annales School" starting in 1950 with Jaime Vincens Vives (1910–1960).&lt;ref&gt;Nil Santiáñez-Tió, "Temporalidad y discurso histórico: Propuesta de una renovación metodológica de la historia de la literatura española moderna." [Temporality and Historical Discourse: Proposal of a Methodological Renewal of the History of Modern Spanish Literature]. ''Hispanic Review'' 1997 65(3): 267–290. {{ISSN|0018-2176}} Fulltext: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/474948  in Jstor]&lt;/ref&gt;   In Mexico, exiled Republican intellectuals extended the Annales approach, particularly from the Center for Historical Studies of El Colegio de México, the leading graduate studies institution of Latin America.

British historians, apart from a few Marxists, were generally hostile. Academic historians decidedly sided with [[Geoffrey Elton]]'s ''[[The Practice of History]]'' against [[Edward Hallett Carr]]'s ''[[What Is History?]]''. One of the few British historians who were sympathetic towards the work of the ''Annales'' school was [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]]. American, German, Indian, Russian and Japanese scholars generally ignored the school. The Americans developed their own form of "new social history" from entirely different roots.  Both the American and the ''Annales'' historians picked up important family reconstitution techniques from French demographer [[Louis Henry]].&lt;ref&gt;Burke, ''French Historical Revolution'' (1990), pp 56, 96–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wageningen University and Research Centre|Wageningen]] school centered on [[Bernard Slicher van Bath]] was viewed internationally as a Dutch counterpart of the Annales school, although Slicher van Bath himself vehemently rejected the idea of a quantitative "school" of historiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |first=Jan |last=Kuys |title=Bernard Hendrik Slicher van Bath |encyclopedia=Biografisch Woordenboek Gelderland |publisher=Verloren |year=2006 |url=http://www.biografischwoordenboekgelderland.nl/bio/6_Bernard_Hendrik_Slicher_van_Bath}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Has been cited as a key influence in the development of [[World Systems Theory]] by sociologist [[Immanuel Wallerstein]].&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel M. 2004. World-Systems Analysis: An Introduction. Durham, NC: Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current==
The current leader is [[Roger Chartier]], who is Directeur d'Études at the [[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences|École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]] in Paris, Professeur in the [[Collège de France]], and Annenberg Visiting Professor of History at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. He frequently lectures and teaches in the United States, Spain, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. His work in Early Modern European History focuses on the history of education, the history of the book and the history of reading.  Recently, he has been concerned with the relationship between written culture as a whole and literature (particularly theatrical plays) for France, England and Spain. His work in this specific field (based on the criss-crossing between literary criticism, bibliography, and sociocultural history) is connected to broader historiographical and methodological interests which deal with the relation between history and other disciplines: philosophy, sociology, anthropology.

Chartier's typical undergraduate course focuses upon the making, remaking, dissemination, and reading of texts in early modern Europe and America. Under the heading of "practices," his class considers how readers read and marked up their books, forms of note-taking, and the interrelation between reading and writing from copying and translating to composing new texts. Under the heading of "materials," his class examines the relations between different kinds of writing surfaces (including stone, wax, parchment, paper, walls, textiles, the body, and the heart), writing implements (including styluses, pens, pencils, needles, and brushes), and material forms (including scrolls, erasable tables, codices, broadsides and printed forms and books). Under the heading of "places," his class explores where texts were made, read, and listened to, including monasteries, schools and universities, offices of the state, the shops of merchants and booksellers, printing houses, theaters, libraries, studies, and closets. The texts for his course include the ''Bible'', translations of Ovid, ''Hamlet'', ''Don Quixote'', Montaigne's essays, Pepys's diary, Richardson's ''Pamela'', and Franklin's autobiography.

An '''artifact''',{{efn|From [[Latin]] phrase ''arte factum''~''ars'' skill + ''facere'' to make}} or '''artefact''' (see [[American and British English spelling differences#Miscellaneous spelling differences|American and British English spelling differences]]), is something made or given shape by humans, such as a tool or a work of art, especially an object of archaeological interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=artefact. (n.d.)|work=Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 11th Edition|accessdate=2 August 2012|via=CollinsDictionary.com |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/artefact}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[archaeology]], however, the word has become a term of particular nuance and is defined as: an object recovered by archaeological endeavor, which may be a [[cultural artifact]] having [[archaeological culture|cultural]] interest. However, modern archaeologists take care to distinguish [[material culture]] from [[ethnicity]], which is often more complex, as expressed by [[Carol Kramer]] in the dictum "pots are not people".&lt;ref&gt;Carol Kramer, "Pots and Peoples" in; Louis D. Levine and T. Culyer Young (eds.), ''Mountains and Lowlands: Essays in the Archaeology of Greater Mesopotamia''; Malibu, Undena, 1977; cited in Serge Cleuziou, "Introduction", [https://books.google.ca/books?id=ag0F80okf-QC&amp;pg=PA17 ''Objets et symboles: de la culture matérielle à l'espace culturel : actes de la 1re Journée doctorale d'archéologie, Paris, 20 mai 2006''], Ed.

Examples include [[stone tool]]s, [[pottery]] vessels, metal objects such as weapons, and items of personal adornment such as [[buttons]], [[jewellery|jewelry]] and clothing.  [[Bones]] that show signs of human modification are also examples. Natural objects, such as fire cracked rocks from a [[hearth]] or plant material used for food, are classified by archeologists as [[ecofacts]] rather than as artifacts. From the point of view of ethnography and archaeology, an ancestral artifact can be defined as "any object of natural raw material (chert, obsidian, wood, bone, native copper, and so on) made by a people following a lifestyle based on foraging (e.g. hunting, gathering) and/or basic agriculture or pastoralism (e.g. horticulture, transhumance)".&lt;ref&gt;Hortolà, Policarp (2017). [http://saa.uaic.ro/articles/SAA.23.2.2017.213-225.pdf “From antiquities to memorabilia: a standardised terminology for ancestral artefacts according to manufacture date”]. ''Studia Antiqua et Archaeologica''. '''23''' (2): 213–225.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
Artifacts can come from any [[archaeological context]] or source such as:

* [[Burial|Buried]] along with a [[Human body|body]]
* From any [[Feature (archaeology)|feature]] such as a [[midden]] or other domestic setting
* [[Votive offering]]s
* [[Hoard]]s, such as at [[aquifer|well]]s

Artifacts are distinguished from the main body of the archaeological record such as [[Stratification (archaeology)|stratigraphic]] [[feature (archaeology)|feature]]s, which are non-portable remains of human activity, such as [[hearth]]s, [[road]]s, deposits, trenches or similar remains, and from [[Biofact (archaeology)|biofact]]s or ecofacts, which are objects of archaeological interest made by other organisms, such as [[seed]]s or [[animal]] [[bone]].

Natural objects that humans have moved but not changed are called [[manuport]]s. Examples include seashells moved inland, or rounded pebbles placed away from the water action that made them.
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[File:The Curmsun Disc - Obverse.png|left|thumb|[[Curmsun Disc]] - Obverse, Jomsborg, 980s, Burial site of king [[Harald Bluetooth]] ]]

These distinctions are often blurred. For instance, a bone removed from an animal carcass is a biofact, but a bone carved into a useful implement is an artifact. Similarly there can be debate over early stone objects that could be either crude artifacts or naturally occurring and happen to resemble early objects made by [[early humans]] or ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. It can be difficult to distinguish the differences between actual man-made [[Stone tool|lithic]] artifacts and [[geofacts]] – naturally occurring lithics &lt;!-- unlink, as overlink, but note that source uses this language, which seems to contrary to the usual sense that "lithic" implies artifact --&gt; that resemble man-made tools. It is possible to authenticate artifacts by examining the general characteristics attributed to man-made tools and local characteristics of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peacock|first1=Evan|title=Distinguishing between Artifacts and Geofacts: A Test Case from Eastern England|journal=Journal of Field Archaeology|date=January 1, 1991|volume=18|issue=3|pages=345–361|url=http://www.maneyonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/009346991791548645|doi=10.1179/009346991791548645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by the [[Utopian socialism|utopian socialist]] [[Henri Saint-Simon]],&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Comte developed the ''positive philosophy'' in an attempt to remedy the social malaise of the [[French Revolution]], calling for a new social doctrine based on the [[sciences]]. Comte was a major influence on 19th-century thought, influencing the work of social thinkers such as [[Karl Marx]], [[John Stuart Mill]], and [[George Eliot]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/lecture25a.html#course&lt;/ref&gt; His concept of ''sociologie'' and  [[social evolutionism]] set the tone for early [[social theorist]]s and [[anthropologist]]s such as [[Harriet Martineau]] and [[Herbert Spencer]], evolving into modern academic sociology presented by [[Émile Durkheim]] as practical and objective [[social research]].

Comte's social theories culminated in his "[[Religion of Humanity]]",&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; which presaged the development of non-theistic [[Religious humanism|religious humanist]] and [[Secular humanism|secular humanist]] organizations in the 19th century. Comte may have coined the word ''altruisme'' ([[Altruism (ethics)|altruism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=altruism (n .)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=altruism|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==

Auguste Comte was born in [[Montpellier]],&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; [[Hérault]] on 19 January 1798. After attending the [[Citadel of Montpellier|Lycée Joffre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mediatheque.montpellier-agglo.com/22887393/0/fiche___document/&amp;RH=1219250799417 |publisher= Montpellier Agglomeration |title= Rencontre avec Annie Petit "Auguste Comte" |date= 2007-10-19 |accessdate= 2008-10-15 |quote= "''Né à Montpellier, brillant élève du Lycée Joffre''..."

The École Polytechnique was notable for its adherence to the French ideals of [[republicanism]] and [[Progress (history)|progress]]. The École closed in 1816 for reorganization, however, and Comte continued his studies at the medical school at Montpellier. When the École Polytechnique reopened, he did not request readmission.

Following his return to Montpellier, Comte soon came to see unbridgeable differences with his [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Monarchism|monarchist]] family and set off again for Paris, earning money by small jobs. In August 1817 he found an apartment at 36 [[rue Bonaparte]] in Paris' [[6th arrondissement of Paris|6ème]] (where he lived until 1822) and later that year he became a student and secretary to  [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], who brought Comte into contact with intellectual society and greatly influenced his thought therefrom. During that time Comte published his first essays in the various publications headed by Saint-Simon, ''L'Industrie'', ''Le Politique'', and ''[[L'Organisateur]]'' ([[Charles Dunoyer]] and [[Charles Comte]]'s ''[[Le Censeur Européen]]''), although he would not publish under his own name until 1819's "La séparation générale entre les opinions et les désirs" ("The general separation of opinions and desires"). In 1824, Comte left Saint-Simon, again because of unbridgeable differences. Comte published a ''Plan de travaux scientifiques nécessaires pour réorganiser la société'' (1822) (''Plan of scientific studies necessary for the reorganization of society''). But he failed to get an academic post. His day-to-day life depended on sponsors and financial help from friends. Debates rage as to how much Comte appropriated the work of Saint-Simon.&lt;ref name="Pickering 192ff."&gt;Pickering (2006), p. 192ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comte married [[Caroline Massin]] in 1825. In 1826, he was taken to a mental health hospital, but left without being cured – only stabilized by French alienist [[Jean-Étienne Dominique Esquirol]] – so that he could work again on his plan (he would later attempt suicide in 1827 by jumping off the [[Pont des Arts]]). In the time between this and their divorce in 1842, he published the six volumes of his ''Cours.''

Comte developed a close friendship with [[John Stuart Mill]]. From 1844, he fell deeply in love with the Catholic [[Clotilde de Vaux]], although because she was not divorced from her first husband, their love was never consummated. After her death in 1846 this love became quasi-religious, and Comte, working closely with Mill (who was refining his own such system) developed a new "[[Religion of Humanity]]". [[John Kells Ingram]], an adherent of Comte, visited him in Paris in 1855.

He published four volumes of ''[[Système de politique positive]]'' (1851–1854). His final work, the first volume of ''La Synthèse Subjective'' ("The Subjective Synthesis"), was published in 1856.

Comte died in Paris on 5 September 1857 from stomach cancer and was buried in the famous [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]], surrounded by cenotaphs in memory of his mother, Rosalie Boyer, and of Clotilde de Vaux.
His apartment from 1841–1857 is now conserved as the [[Maison d'Auguste Comte]] and is located at 10 rue Monsieur-le-Prince, in Paris' [[6th arrondissement of Paris|6th arrondissement]].

==Thought==

===Comte's positivism===
{{Main|Positivism|Law of three stages}}
Comte first described the [[epistemology|epistemological]] perspective of positivism in ''[[The Course in Positive Philosophy]]'', a series of texts published between 1830 and 1842. These texts were followed by the 1848 work, ''[[A General View of Positivism]]'' (published in English in 1865). The first three volumes of the ''Course'' dealt chiefly with the physical sciences already in existence ([[mathematics]], [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]]), whereas the latter two emphasised the inevitable coming of [[social science]]. Observing the circular dependence of theory and observation in science, and classifying the sciences in this way, Comte may be regarded as the first [[philosopher of science]] in the modern sense of the term.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;{{Cite book |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/ |title= Stanford Encyclopaedia: Auguste Comte |website= plato.stanford.edu|chapter= Auguste Comte |publisher= Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |year= 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comte was also the first to distinguish natural philosophy from science explicitly. For him, the physical sciences had necessarily to arrive first, before humanity could adequately channel its efforts into the most challenging and complex "Queen science" of human society itself. His work ''View of Positivism'' would therefore set out to define, in more detail, the empirical goals of sociological method.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Comte offered an [[Sociocultural evolution|account of social evolution]], proposing that society undergoes three phases in its quest for the truth according to a general 'law of three stages'.

Comte's stages were (1) the ''[[theological]]'' stage, (2) the ''[[Metaphysics|metaphysical]]'' stage, and (3) the ''positive'' stage.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, ''Positivism and Sociology'', 1&lt;/ref&gt;  (1) The Theological stage was seen from the perspective of 19th century France as preceding the [[Age of Enlightenment]], in which man's place in society and society's restrictions upon man were referenced to God. Man blindly believed in whatever he was taught by his ancestors. He believed in a supernatural power. [[Fetishism]] played a significant role during this time. (2) By the "Metaphysical" stage, Comte referred not to the Metaphysics of [[Aristotle]] or other ancient Greek philosophers. Rather, the idea was rooted in the problems of French society subsequent to the [[French Revolution]] of 1789. This Metaphysical stage involved the justification of ''universal rights'' as being on a vauntedly higher plane than the authority of any human ruler to countermand, although said rights were not referenced to the sacred beyond mere metaphor. This stage is known as the stage of investigation, because people started reasoning and questioning, although no solid evidence was laid. The stage of investigation was the beginning of a world that questioned authority and religion. (3) In the Scientific stage, which came into being after the failure of the revolution and of [[Napoleon]], people could find solutions to social problems and bring them into force despite the proclamations of ''human rights'' or prophecy of ''the will of God.'' Science started to answer questions in full stretch. In this regard he was similar to [[Karl Marx]] and [[Jeremy Bentham]]. For its time, this idea of a Scientific stage was considered up-to-date, although from a later standpoint, it is too derivative of [[classical physics]] and [[academic history]]. Comte's [[law of three stages]] was one of the first theories of [[social evolutionism]].

[[File:Comte's Theory of Science.png |thumb|left|''Comte's Theory of Science'' – According to Comte, the whole of the sciences consists of theoretical and applied knowledge. Theoretical knowledge can generally be divided into physics and biology, which are the object of his research and can be further partitioned into subfields such as botany, zoology or mineralogy. Comte's ranking of scientific fields - in order, mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology and sociology - symbolizes a decreasing range of research and complexity of theoretical tools, but a growing complexity of the phenomena under investigation. Each field in this ranking depends upon those that came before it; for instance, our understanding of chemistry depends upon our understanding of physics, as all chemical phenomena are more complicated than the physics that underlie them, and although the laws of chemistry are affected by the laws of physics, the converse is not true. Similarly, sciences that appear earlier in Comte's hierarchy are considered to be older and more advanced than those which come later.]]

The other universal law he called the "encyclopedic law". By combining these laws, Comte developed a systematic and hierarchical classification of all sciences, including inorganic physics ([[astronomy]], [[earth science]] and [[chemistry]]) and organic physics ([[biology]] and, for the first time, ''physique sociale'', later renamed ''sociologie''). Independently from [[Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès]]'s introduction of the term in 1780, Comte re-invented "sociologie", and introduced the term as a neologism, in 1838. Comte had earlier used the term "social physics", but that term had been appropriated by others, notably by [[Adolphe Quetelet]].

{{quote|The most important thing to determine was the natural order in which the sciences stand — not how they can be made to stand, but how they must stand, irrespective of the wishes of any one....This Comte accomplished by taking as the criterion of the position of each the degree of what he called "positivity", which is simply the degree to which the phenomena can be exactly determined. This, as may be readily seen, is also a measure of their relative complexity, since the exactness of a science is in inverse proportion to its complexity. The degree of exactness or positivity is, moreover, that to which it can be subjected to mathematical demonstration, and therefore mathematics, which is not itself a concrete science, is the general gauge by which the position of every science is to be determined. Generalizing thus, Comte found that there were five great groups of phenomena of equal classificatory value but of successively decreasing positivity. To these he gave the names: astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, and sociology.|[[Lester F. Ward]], ''The Outlines of Sociology'' (1898)}}

This idea of a special science (not the humanities, not [[metaphysics]]) for the social was prominent in the 19th century and not unique to Comte. It has recently been discovered that the term "sociology" (as a term considered coined by Comte) had already been introduced in 1780, albeit with a different meaning, by the French essayist [[Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès]] (1748–1836).&lt;ref&gt;''Des Manuscrits de Sieyès. 1773–1799'', Volumes I and II, published by Christine Fauré, Jacques Guilhaumou, Jacques Vallier et Françoise Weil, Paris, Champion, 1999 and 2007. See also Jacques Guilhaumou, ''Sieyès et le non-dit de la sociologie: du mot à la chose, in Revue d'histoire des sciences humaines'', Number 15, November 2006. ''Naissances de la science sociale''.&lt;/ref&gt; The ambitious (or many would say 'grandiose') way that Comte conceived of this special science of the social, however, was unique. Comte saw this new science, sociology, as the last and greatest of all sciences, one which would include all other sciences and integrate and relate their findings into a cohesive whole. It has to be pointed out, however, that he noted a seventh science, one even greater than sociology. Namely, Comte considered "[[Anthropology]], or true science of Man [to be] the last gradation in the Grand Hierarchy of Abstract Science."&lt;ref&gt;1874 translation of ''System of Positive Polity'', Vol. II, pages 356–347, cited in Urbanowicz, Charles F. 1992. "Four-Field Commentary". ''Anthropology Newsletter''. Volume 33, Number 9, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flag of Brazil.svg|left|thumb|The motto ''Ordem e Progresso'' ("Order and Progress") in the [[flag of Brazil]] is inspired by Auguste Comte's motto of positivism: ''L'amour pour principe et l'ordre pour base; le progrès pour but'' ("Love as a principle and order as the basis; Progress as the goal"). Several of those involved in the military coup d'état that deposed the [[Empire of Brazil]] and proclaimed Brazil to be [[Republic of Brazil|a republic]] were followers of the ideas of Comte.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wais.stanford.edu/Brazil/brazil_orderandprogress42703.html BRAZIL: Order and Progress, Ronald Hilton, World Association of International Studies Forum Q&amp;A, 4/27/03]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Comte's explanation of the Positive philosophy introduced the important relationship between theory, practice and human understanding of the world. On page 27 of the 1855 printing of [[Harriet Martineau]]'s translation of ''The Positive Philosophy of Auguste Comte'', we see his observation that, "If it is true that every theory must be based upon observed facts, it is equally true that facts can not be observed without the guidance of some theories. Without such guidance, our facts would be desultory and fruitless; we could not retain them: for the most part we could not even perceive them."&lt;ref&gt;Comte, A. b (1974 reprint). ''The positive philosophy of Auguste Comte freely translated and condensed by Harriet Martineau''. New York: AMS Press. (Original work published in 1855, New York: Calvin Blanchard, p. 27.b)&lt;/ref&gt;

Comte's emphasis on the interconnectedness of social elements was a forerunner of modern [[functionalism (sociology)|functionalism]]. Nevertheless, as with many others of Comte's time, certain elements of his work are now viewed as eccentric and unscientific, and his grand vision of sociology as the centerpiece of all the sciences has not come to fruition.

His emphasis on a quantitative, mathematical basis for decision-making remains with us today. It is a foundation of the modern notion of Positivism, modern quantitative [[statistical analysis]], and business decision-making. His description of the continuing cyclical relationship between theory and practice is seen in modern business systems of [[Total Quality Management]] (TQM) and [[Continual improvement process|Continuous Quality Improvement]] where advocates describe a continuous cycle of theory and practice through the four-part cycle of [[Plan-Do-Check-Act]] ([[PDCA]], the [[Shewhart cycle]]). Despite his advocacy of quantitative analysis, Comte saw a limit in its ability to help explain social phenomena.

The early sociology of [[Herbert Spencer]] came about broadly as a reaction to Comte; writing after various developments in evolutionary biology, Spencer attempted to reformulate the discipline in what we might now describe as [[social Darwinism|socially Darwinistic]] terms.

Comte's fame today owes in part to [[Émile Littré]], who founded ''The Positivist Review'' in 1867. Debates continue to rage, however, as to how much Comte appropriated from the work of his mentor, [[Henri de Saint-Simon]].

Comte influenced the [[Young Turks]] political movement.&lt;ref&gt;http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~fisher/hst373/readings/hanioglu.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===The religion of humanity===
[[File:Templo positivista.jpg|thumb|right|Positivist temple in [[Porto Alegre]]]]
In later years, Comte developed the '[[religion of humanity]]' for positivist societies in order to fulfil the cohesive function once held by traditional worship. In 1849, he proposed a [[calendar reform]] called the '[[positivist calendar]]'. For close associate [[John Stuart Mill]], it was possible to distinguish between a "good Comte" (the author of the ''Course in Positive Philosophy'') and a "bad Comte" (the author of the secular-religious ''system'').&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; The ''system'' was unsuccessful but met with the publication of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859) to influence the proliferation of various [[Secular Humanist]] organizations in the 19th century, especially through the work of secularists such as [[George Holyoake]] and [[Richard Congreve]]. Although Comte's English followers, including [[George Eliot]] and Harriet Martineau, for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion of humanity and his injunction to "vivre pour autrui" ("live for others"), from which comes the word "[[altruism]]".&lt;ref&gt;"Comte's secular religion is no vague effusion of humanistic piety, but a complete system of belief and ritual, with liturgy and sacraments, priesthood and pontiff, all organized around the public veneration of Humanity, the ''Nouveau Grand-Être Suprême'' (New Supreme Great Being), later to be supplemented in a positivist trinity by the ''Grand Fétish'' (the Earth) and the ''Grand Milieu'' (Destiny)" According to Davies (p. 28-29), Comte's austere and "slightly dispiriting" philosophy of humanity viewed as alone in an indifferent universe (which can only be explained by "positive" science) and with nowhere to turn but to each other, was even more influential in Victorian England than the theories of Charles Darwin or Karl Marx.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law of three stages===
{{Main|Law of three stages}}
Comte was agitated by the fact that no one had synthesized physics, chemistry, and biology into a coherent system of ideas, so he began an attempt to reasonably deduce facts about the social world from the use of the sciences. Through his studies, he concluded that the growth of the human mind progresses in stages, and so must societies. He claimed the history of society could be divided into three different stages: theological, metaphysical, and positive. The Law of three Stages, an evolutionary theory, describes how history of societies is split into three sections due to new thoughts on philosophy. Comte believed that evolution was the growth of the human mind, splitting into stages and evolving through these stages. Comte concluded that society acts similarly to the mind.&lt;ref name="Delaney, Tim 2003"&gt;Delaney, Tim. "Auguste Comte". Council for Secular Humanism. ''Council for Secular Humanism'', Oct.-Nov. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The law is this: that each of our leading conceptions&amp;nbsp;{{ndash}} each branch of our knowledge&amp;nbsp;{{ndash}} passes successively through three different theoretical conditions: the Theological, or fictitious; the Metaphysical, or abstract; and the Scientific, or positive.|A. Comte&lt;ref&gt;From ''The Positive Philosophy of Auguste Comte'' (trans. Harriet Martineau; London, 1853), Vol. I, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Law of Three Stages is the evolution of society in which the stages have already occurred or are currently developing. The reason why there are newly developed stages after a certain time period is that the system "has lost its power" and is preventing the progression of civilization, causing complicated situations in society. 10.&lt;ref name="Comte, Auguste 1975"&gt;Comte, Auguste, and Gertrud Lenzer. Auguste Comte and Positivism: The Essential Writings. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1975. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The only way to escape the situation is for people within the civilized nations to turn towards an "organic" new social system. Comte refers to kings to show the complications of re-establishment on society. Kings feel the need to reorganize their kingdom, but many fail to succeed because they do not consider that the progress of civilization needs reform, not perceiving that there is nothing more perfect than inserting a new, more harmonious system. Kings fail to see the effectiveness of abandoning old systems because they do not understand the nature of the present crisis. But in order to progress, there needs to be the necessary consequences that come with it, which is caused by a "series of modifications, independent of the human will, to which all classes of society contributed, and of which kings themselves have often been the first agents and most eager promoters".&lt;ref name="Comte, Auguste 1975"/&gt; The people themselves have the ability to produce a new system. This pattern is shown through the theological stage, metaphysical stage, and positive stage.

# Theological Stage
##The first stage, the theological stage, relies on supernatural or religious explanations of the phenomena of human behavior because "the human mind, in its search for the primary and final causes of phenomena, explains the apparent anomalies in the universe as interventions of supernatural agents".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bourdeau, Michel. Auguste Comte. Stanford University. http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/ [April 28, 2016].&lt;/ref&gt; The Theological Stage is the "necessary starting point of human intelligence", when humans turn to supernatural agents as the cause of all phenomena.&lt;ref name="Auguste Comte 2015"&gt;"Auguste Comte." Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6Th Edition (2015): 1. MAS Ultra   School Edition. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; In this stage, humans focus on discovering absolute knowledge. Comte disapproved this stage because it turned to simple explanation humans created in their minds that all phenomena was caused by supernatural agents, rather than human reason and experience. Comte refers to Bacon’s philosophy that "there can be no real knowledge except that which rests upon observed facts", but he observes that the primitive mind could not have thought that way because it would have only created a vicious circle between observations and theories.&lt;ref name="Auguste Comte 2015"/&gt; "For if, on the one hand, every positive theory must necessarily be founded upon observations, it is, on the other hand, no less true that, in order to observe, our mind has need of some theory or other".&lt;ref name="Auguste Comte 2015"/&gt; Because the human mind could not have thought in that way in the origin of human knowledge, Comte claims that humans would have been "incapable of remembering facts", and would not have escaped the circle if it were not for theological conceptions, which were less complicated explanations to human life.&lt;ref name="Auguste Comte 2015"/&gt; Although Comte disliked this stage, he explains that theology was necessary in the beginning of the developing primitive mind. 
## Fetishism
## Polytheism
## Monotheism
# Metaphysical or Abstract Stage
::The second stage, the metaphysical stage, is merely a modification of the first because a supernatural cause is replaced by an "abstract entity";&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; it is meant to be a transitional stage, where there is the belief that abstract forces control the behavior of human beings. Because it is a transitional stage between the theological stage and the positive stage, Comte deemed it the least important of the three stages and was only necessary because the human mind cannot make the jump from the theological to the positive stage on its own. 

::The metaphysical stage is the transitional stage. Because "Theology and physics are so profoundly incompatible", and their "conceptions are so radically opposed in character", human intelligence must have a gradual transition.&lt;ref name="Auguste Comte 2015"/&gt; Other than this, Comte says that there is no other use for this stage. Although it is the least important stage, it is necessary because humans could not handle the significant change in thought from theological to positivity.&lt;ref name="Delaney, Tim 2003"/&gt; The metaphysical stage is just a slight modification of the previous stage, when people believed in the abstract forces rather than the supernatural. The mind begins to notice the facts themselves, caused by the emptiness of the metaphysical agents through "over subtle qualification that all right-minded persons considered them to be only the abstract names of the phenomena in question".&lt;ref name="Comte, Auguste 1975"/&gt; The mind becomes familiar with concepts, wanting to seek more, and therefore is prepared to move into the positive stage.

:3. Positive stage
::The last stage – the positive stage – is when the mind stops searching for the cause of phenomena and realizes that laws exist to govern human behavior, and that this stage can be explained rationally with the use of reason and observation, both of which are used to study the social world.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Delaney, Tim. Auguste Comte. Council for Secular Humanism, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; This stage relies on science, rational thought, and empirical laws. Comte believed that this study of sociology he created was "the science that [came] after all the others; and as the final science, it must assume the task of coordinating the development of the whole of knowledge"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; because it organized all of human behavior.

The final, most evolved stage is the positivist stage, the stage when humans give up on discovering absolute truth, and turn towards discovering, through reasoning and observation, actual laws of phenomena.&lt;ref name="Comte, Auguste 1975"/&gt; Humans realize that laws exist, and that the world can be rationally explained through science, rational thought, laws, and observation. Comte was a positivist, believing in the natural rather than the supernatural, and so he claimed that his time period, the 1800s, was in the positivist stage.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; He believed that within this stage, there is a hierarchy of sciences: mathematics, astronomy, terrestrial physics, chemistry, and physiology. Mathematics, the "science that relates to the measurement of magnitudes", is the most perfect science of all, and is applied to the most important laws of the universe.&lt;ref name="Comte, Auguste 1975"/&gt; Astronomy is the most simple science, and is the first "to be subjected to positive theories".&lt;ref name="Auguste Comte 2015"/&gt; Physics is less satisfactory than astronomy, because it is more complex, having less pure and systemized theories. Physics, as well as chemistry, are the "general laws of the inorganic world", and are harder to distinguish.&lt;ref name="Comte, Auguste 1975"/&gt; Physiology completes the system of natural sciences, and is the most important of all sciences because it is the "only solid basis of the social reorganization that must terminate the crisis in which the most civilized nations have found themselves".&lt;ref name="Auguste Comte 2015"/&gt; This stage will fix the problems in current nations, allowing progression and peace.
 
===A famous error of Comte===
Auguste Comte is famous for writing in his book "''The Positive Philosophy''" that people would never learn the chemical composition of the planets.  In thirty years people were beginning to learn just that through spectroscopy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spiff.rit.edu/richmond/asras/chemcomp_i/chemcomp_i.html How do we know the composition of stars?]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1781">In the year 616 an anonymous scholar extended [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table]] to an Easter table covering the years 532 up to and including 721.   Dionysius' table was published in 525 and only a century later accepted by the church of Rome, which from the third century up till then had given preference to go on using her own, relatively inadequate, Easter tables.   From about the middle of the seventh century all controversy between Alexandria and Rome as to the correct date of Easter ceased, as both churches were now using identical tables.   

In the year 725 [[Bede#Scientific writings|Bede]] (Latin name Beda Venerabilis) published a new extension of Dionysius’ Easter table to a great '''Easter cycle''', which is periodic in its entirety and in which consequently not only the sequence of (Julian calendar) dates of Alexandrian [[Paschal full moon]] but also the sequence of (Julian calendar) dates of Alexandrian [[Easter Sunday]] is periodic. Bede’s Easter cycle contains lunar cycles (of 19 years) as well as solar cycles (of 28 years), and therefore it has a period of 532 years. In the [[Byzantine empire]] thanks to the Paschal cycle of [[Annianus of Alexandria]] at all times the churches were acquainted with the correct date of the next Easter Sunday. It is Beda Venerabilis’ Easter cycle by means of which also the churches in the part of Europe outside the Byzantine empire got that possibility.

'''Bric-à-brac''' or '''bric-a-brac''' (origin [[French language|French]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bric-a-brac Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; first used in the [[Victorian era]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]'' first reference in English: 1840.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to lesser [[Objet d'art|objets d'art]] forming [[collecting|collections]] of [[wikt:curio|curio]]s, such as elaborately decorated teacups and small vases, compositions of feathers or [[artificial flower|wax flowers]] under glass domes, decorated eggshells, porcelain figurines, painted [[Portrait miniature|miniatures]] or photographs in stand-up frames, and so on. 

In middle-class homes bric-à-brac was used as ornament on [[mantelpiece]]s, tables, and shelves, or was displayed in [[curio cabinet]]s: sometimes these cabinets have glass doors to display the items within while protecting them from dust. Today, "bric-à-brac" refers to a selection of items of modest value, often sold in street markets and charity shops, and may be more commonly known in colloquial English as "knick knacks."

[[Edith Wharton]] and [[Ogden Codman, Jr.]], in ''The Decoration of Houses'' (1897), distinguished three gradations of quality in such "household ornaments": ''bric-à-brac'', ''bibelots'' ([[wikt:trinket|trinket]]s) and ''objets d'art''.&lt;ref&gt;"French speech... has provided at least three designations, each indicating a delicate and almost imperceptible gradation of quality": Wharton and Codman, ''The Decoration of Houses'', 1897, Ch.

This skyscraper stands on the site of [[Victor Horta]]'s [[Art Nouveau]] ''{{lang|fr|[[Maison du Peuple]]}}''. (Photo taken from {{lang|fr|Rue Samaritaine}}).]]
In [[urban planning]], '''Brusselization''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#-ise.2C -ize .28-isation.2C -ization.29|UK and US]]) or '''Brusselisation '''([[American and British English spelling differences#-ise.2C -ize .28-isation.2C -ization.29|UK variant]]) ({{lang-fr|bruxellisation}}, {{lang-nl|verbrusseling}}) is "the indiscriminate and careless introduction of modern high-rise buildings into [[gentrification|gentrified]] neighbourhoods" and has become a byword for "haphazard urban development and redevelopment".{{sfn|State|2004|p=51–52}}{{sfn|Stubbs|Makaš|2011|pp=121}}

The notion applies to anywhere whose development follows the pattern of the uncontrolled development of [[Brussels]] in the 1960s and 1970s, that resulted from a lack of [[zoning]] regulations and the city authorities' laissez-faire approach to city planning.{{sfn|State|2004|p=51–52}}{{sfn|Béghain|Gabilliet|2004|p=109}}{{sfn|Papadopoulos|1996|p=66}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Romańczyk, K.

== Brussels ==

=== From the 1960s to the 1980s ===
The original Brusselization was the type of urban regeneration performed by the city of [[Brussels]] in connection with [[Expo 58]]. In order to prepare the city for Expo 58, buildings were torn down without regard either to their architectural or historical importance,{{sfn|Elliott|Cole|2010|p=64}} high-capacity square office/apartment buildings were built, boulevards were created and tunnels dug. Among the most controversial was the large-scale demolition of [[townhouse]]s for development of the high-rise business district in the [[Northern Quarter (Brussels)|Northern Quarter]]. All of these changes were designed to quickly increase the number of people working and living in the city and improve transportation.

Further radical changes resulted from Brussels's role as the center of the [[European Union|EU]] and [[NATO]],{{sfn|State|2004|p=51–52}}{{sfn|Elliott|Cole|2010|p=64}} beginning with the construction of the [[European Commission]] headquarters in 1959.{{sfn|Stubbs|Makaš|2011|pp=120}} The introduction of a high-speed rail network in the 1990s was the latest excuse to speculate on multiple rows of properties for modern office/hotel redevelopment, which led to the razing of neighborhood blocks near [[Brussels-South railway station]].

These changes caused outcry amongst the citizens of Brussels and by [[environmentalism|environmentalist]] and [[preservationism|preservationist]] organizations. The demolition of [[Victor Horta]]'s [[Art Nouveau]] ''{{lang|fr|[[Maison du Peuple]]}}'' in 1965 was one focus of such protests, (see photograph on right for what now stands on its site), as was the construction of the IBM Tower in 1978.{{sfn|State|2004|p=51–52}}

Many architects protested, and it was the architectural world that coined the name Brusselization for what was happening to Brussels. Architects such as {{lang|fr|[[Léon Krier]]}} and {{lang|fr|[[Maurice Culot]]}} formulated an [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] urban planning theory, as a rejection of the rampant modernism that they saw overtaking Brussels.{{sfn|Lagrou|2003|p=303}}{{sfn|Béghain|Gabilliet|2004|p=109}}

=== Historical precedent and underpinnings for modernization in Brussels ===
The 1950s was not the first time that the city had been radically altered by major redevelopment. Two prior sweeping changes to the urban fabric of Brussels were the straight-lined central avenues modeled after [[Paris]], which were created by [[covering of the Senne|covering and diverting the Senne]] river, and the [[North–South connection|North–South railway connection]], which took around 40 years to finish (1911–52) and which had left swaths of the city center filled with debris and craters for decades. Another precedent is the erecting of the [[Palais de Justice, Brussels|Palace of Justice]], the largest building in the world constructed in the 1800s. [[André de Vries]] asserts that the penchant for heavy-handedness can be traced back to the reign of [[Leopold II of Belgium|Leopold II]] in the late 19th century, and possibly even all the way back to the [[bombardment of Brussels|bombardment of the city]] by [[Louis XIV]]'s troops in 1695. "There is barely one building still standing", he says, "from before 1695, with the exception of some churches and the Town Hall".{{sfn|De Vries|2003|p=14}}

Leopold II sought to give Brussels the image of a grand capital city of an imperial/colonial power. By the middle 20th century there was a tacit alliance between urban development entrepreneurs and local government, with a modernist agenda and with their sights set firmly on large-scale development projects. The citizens of Brussels were largely left out of the process.{{sfn|Swyngedouw|Moyersoen|2006|p=158}}

=== The 1990s: From Brusselization to façadism ===

In the early 1990s laws were introduced restricting the demolition of buildings that were deemed to have architectural or historical significance; and in 1999 the city authorities' urban development plan explicitly declared high-rise buildings to be architecturally incompatible with the existing aesthetics of the city centre.{{sfn|State|2004|p=51–52}}{{sfn|Stubbs|Makaš|2011|pp=120}} This led to the rise of what was termed ''{{lang|fr|[[facadism|façadisme]]}}'' — the destruction of the whole interior of a historic building while preserving its historic [[façade]].{{sfn|Hein|2004|p=264}}{{sfn|Stubbs|Makaš|2011|pp=121}}{{sfn|De Vries|2003|p=14}}

These laws were the Town Planning Act 1991, which gave local authorities the powers to refuse demolition requests on the grounds of historical, aesthetic, or cultural significance, and to designate architectural heritage zones; and the Heritage Conservation Act of 1993, which gave the government of the [[Brussels Capital Region]] the power to designate buildings to be protected for historic reasons. However, this system had its deficiencies. Whilst the Capital Region government could designate historic buildings, it was the nineteen municipal authorities within it that were responsible for demolition permits. Not until the introduction of a ''{{lang|fr|permis unique}}'' system was this internecine conflict resolved.{{sfn|Stubbs|Makaš|2011|pp=120}}

'''Charles William Meredith van de Velde''' (born December 3, 1818 in [[Leeuwarden]], died 20 March 1898 in [[Menton]]) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[lieutenant]]-at-sea second class, [[painting|painter]], honorary member of the [[Red Cross]] and [[missionary]].&lt;ref&gt;de Vries, J., ''C.W.M. van de Velde.'', Eigen Haard, pp. 764-766., 1898.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonkheer G.M. Verspijck. ''Het Nederlandse Rode Kruis (1867-1967).'' G.F. Callenbach. Nijkerk&lt;/ref&gt;

Van der Velde attended the Naval Academy in [[Medemblik]] and became Lieutenant-sea second class. From 1830-1841 he worked at the topographical office in modern-day [[Jakarta]] where he eventually became director. In 1844 he had to return to Europe for health reasons, where he carried out [[cartographic]], [[geographic]] and [[ethnographic]] work and was also employed as a [[draftsman]], and [[missionary]] [[nurse]]. In 1844, on his return to Europe, he visited [[Ceylon]], the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] and [[Cape of Good Hope]], where he supported the work of missions and for his services provided to French ships, was awarded a [[Legion of Honour]].

In 1851 Van de Velde visited [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], where he carried out various surveys, drawings, paintings and around one hundred [[watercolour]]s for postcards. After his trip, he held lectures on Palestine in [[Geneva]] and [[Lausanne]].

On 13 March 1864, van de Velde was one of the first delegates from the newly formed International Committee of the [[Red Cross]] to act as an impartial intermediary in the [[Second Schleswig War]]. He assisted the wounded and captured [[Prussian]] and [[Austrians|Austrian]] soldiers and helped establish the Red Cross as a relief organization in the 1863 conference resolutions.

On 31 July 1867, Van de Velde was made an honorary member of the main Committee of the Red Cross, which included [[Willem Jan Knoop]] and [[Henri Dunant]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/57jnvu?opendocument ICRC documentation featuring Charles William Meredith van de Velde]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31950">'''Conjectural history''' is a type of [[historiography]] isolated in the 1790s by [[Dugald Stewart]], who termed it "theoretical or conjectural history", as prevalent in the historians and early social scientists of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]]. As Stewart saw it, such history makes space for speculation about causes of events, by postulating natural causes that could have had such an effect. His concept was to be identified closely with the French terminology ''histoire raisonnée'', and the usage of "natural history" by [[David Hume]] in his work ''[[The Natural History of Religion]]''. It was related to "philosophical history", a broader-based kind of historical theorising, but concentrated on the early history of man in a type of [[rational reconstruction]] that had little contact with evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Smith|title=The Glasgow Edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith: III: Essays on Philosophical Subjects : With Dugald Stewart's 'Account of Adam Smith': With Dugald Stewart's 'Account of Adam Smith'|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=48IO3cLjaWcC&amp;pg=PA293|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=1 May 1980|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-159117-4|page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gordon MacIntyre|title=Dugald Stewart: The Pride and Ornament of Scotland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jOFVh-i3Z04C&amp;pg=PA253|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=1 September 2003|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-903900-34-5|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank Palmeri|title=Satire, History, Novel: Narrative Forms, 1665–1815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HZrp6ZZQmiYC&amp;pg=PA232|accessdate=2 March 2013|year=2003|publisher=University of Delaware Press|isbn=978-0-87413-829-0|pages=231–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such conjectural history was the antithesis of the [[narrative history]] being written at the time by [[Edward Gibbon]] and [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]]. Stewart defended it as more universal in its application to [[humankind]], even at the cost of detailed documentation.&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet and Costa, p. 629.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not concerned with the political narrative and public life, but saw itself as an investigative "moral science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Salber Phillips|title=Society and Sentiment: Genres of Historical Writing in Britain, 1740–1820|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zZjGBmpk88C&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=3 March 2013|date=1 May 2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-2362-8|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; General philosophical history was somewhat closer to narrative history than conjectural history could be, with its reliance in part on tenuous arguments on the nature of [[feudalism]] and early ethnographical reports from European travellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rosemary Sweet|title=Writing of Urban Histories in 18th Century England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n32ZwLcgaFUC&amp;pg=PA143|accessdate=2 March 2013|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-820669-9|pages=143–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Stewart the ''Dissertation on the Origin of Languages'' by [[Adam Smith]] was an important example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=scottish-18th |title=Scottish Philosophy in the 18th Century |last=Broadie |first=Alexander|Thu Aug 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; To justify the procedures of conjectural history, there needed to be an assumption of the uniformity of [[human nature]], or as Stewart put it, the "capacities of the human mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Alexander Broadie |title=The Scottish Enlightenment: An Anthology|year=1997 |publisher=Canongate Books |isbn=978-0-86241-738-3|pages=25–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conjectural history has been identified as "the core of a theory" of [[progress (history)|progress]] within Scottish philosophical history of the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Salber Phillips|title=Society and Sentiment: Genres of Historical Writing in Britain, 1740–1820|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zZjGBmpk88C&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=1 May 2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-2362-8|pages=171–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pocock writes that Scottish conjectural history was "of considerable importance to Gibbon and the creation of philosophical historiography".&lt;ref&gt;Pocock, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1780s there were European historians of culture who worked in a different way, preferring an [[inductive method]] to the pure deductions of conjectural history.&lt;ref name="Carhart2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael C.

==Early Modern context==
There was nothing new in the idea of stages of society on its own, but social thinking itself was changing in [[Early Modern Europe]], particularly on [[civil society]] in its components, [[civility]] and "society".

===Models and the "savage"===
{{main article|Noble savage}}
Hodgen comments, in a chapter ''From Hierarchy to History'', on the widespread use of "conjectural series" for historical explanation in the Early Modern period. The [[great chain of being]] was a static idea. "Stage series" had roots in classical thought, but might be associated with cyclic models, or incorporate ideas of decline with those of progress. She writes that in time

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;it seems certain that hierarchical ideas, temporalized to suit the needs of the conjectural historian of culture, were mixed with historical assumptions concerning the savage as a conjectural first member of these conjectural series.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgen, p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Early Modern natural history===
While the ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]] was a classical Roman encyclopedic work, "natural history" had several different meanings in the Early Modern period. The one relevant in this article is the [[Baconian natural history]], i.e. a systematic collection of observable information on natural phenomena. A natural history did not belong to [[natural philosophy]], which was theoretical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=G. N. Cantor|author3=J. R. R. Christie|author2=M. J. S. Hodge, R. C. Olby|title=Companion to the History of Modern Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gkJn6ciwYZsC&amp;pg=PT260|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=6 August 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-97751-2|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Histoire raisonnée''===
The ''histoire raisonnée'' was a genre of historical writing developed in France in the 17th century, with concerns for the individual in social context, and the description of culture and customs as integral to history. It grew out of [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] historiography with its close relationship to classical Roman and Greek models, but brought to the surface social matters, in particular as they could explain the motivations of individuals. With [[Géraud de Cordemoy]] there came an interest in causality as playing a part in historical movement, as distinct from the humanist acceptance of personal fates being subject to [[Fortuna|Fortune]].&lt;ref&gt;Leffler, pp. 223–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stadial history===
Contemporary terminology is '''stadial history''', or in other words the discussion of stages of society by theoretical means (see [[sociocultural evolution#Stadial theory]]). Stadial theory as an innovation is attributed to the jurist [[Samuel Pufendorf]].&lt;ref name="FitzpatrickJones2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Martin Fitzpatrick|author2=Peter Jones|author3=Christa Knellwolf|author4=Iain McCalman|title=Enlightenment World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSFy4wZ6Bz0C&amp;pg=PT258|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=22 July 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-60784-6|pages=258–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grotius]] had already used conjectural history to discuss [[Aquinas]] on [[private property]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Istvan Hont|title=Jealousy Of Trade: International Competition and the Nation State in Historical Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lHu6kBLV4CUC&amp;pg=PA422|accessdate=4 March 2013|year=2005|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-01038-3|pages=422–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some basic conjectural history on [[human civilization]] was therefore discussed in the 17th century. Later [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] rejected the concept of the [[state of nature]], and with [[Count Buffon]] debated the rise of civilization. The Scottish contribution then took the theory to a new level, with its [[anthropocentrism]] and detailed explanations of human manipulation of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nathaniel Wolloch|title=History and Nature in the Enlightenment: Praise of the Mastery of Nature in Eighteenth-Century Historical Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aWYe2DZbYskC&amp;pg=PA92|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=1 May 2011|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-2115-3|pages=92–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It laid emphasis on a typical society at its beginnings, regarding evidence from contemporary reports (particularly of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]) as valid.&lt;ref&gt;Hopfl, pp. 24–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conjectural histories of language and writing==
Adam Smith in lectures on rhetoric, given from 1748,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Simpson Ross|title=The Life of Adam Smith|page=80|date=23 September 2010|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-161394-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; advanced a speculative history of language; he wrote that he had been prompted by a 1747 work of [[Gabriel Girard (priest)|Gabriel Girard]]. He was then interested in our awareness of literary style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Adam Smith: The Rhetoric of Propriety|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d_MODA0NVjQC&amp;pg=PA83|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8262-9|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the example that Dugald Stewart took up in coining the phrase "conjectural history". Elements would have been recognised at the time as drawing on the Bible, and in classical literature [[Lucretius]]; it is now considered Smith was influenced by [[Montesquieu]] on law and government. The theory on language and its typology over time has been seen as typical of Smith's historical approach; and even the foundation of his later well-known work on [[political economy]]. Caveats have also been entered, by David Raphael: it cannot be stretched to Smith's [[history of astronomy]]; and the term can be seen as a misnomer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Simpson Ross|title=The Life of Adam Smith|pages=85–7|date=23 September 2010|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-161394-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gordon Bigelow|title=Fiction, Famine, and the Rise of Economics in Victorian Britain and Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BLIwbbcbuKcC&amp;pg=PA50|date=20 November 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-44085-1|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monboddo, on the other hand, wrote at length a conjectural history of language because he emphasised the history of [[manners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Salber Phillips|title=Society and Sentiment: Genres of Historical Writing in Britain, 1740–1820|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zZjGBmpk88C&amp;pg=PA151|date=1 May 2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=1-4008-2362-5|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Warburton]] had proposed a stadial conjectural history of writing in his ''[[Divine Legation of Moses]]'', a work supporting [[biblical authority]], around 1740. It was taken up in France after the translation in ''[[Essai sur les hiéroglyphes des Égyptiens]]''. Where writing moved from [[pictogram]]s to [[alphabet]]s, he saw language use as having moved analogously from [[gesture]]s to forms and figures of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jorge Cañizares-Esguerra|title=How to Write the History of the New World: Histories, Epistemologies, and Identities in the Eighteenth-century Atlantic World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JzIGYxOC1oUC&amp;pg=PA109|year=2001|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-4693-9|pages=109–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The four stages theory==
The term "conjectural history" was not generally accepted in Stewart's time.&lt;ref name="O'Brien"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karen O'Brien|title=Narratives of Enlightenment: Cosmopolitan History from Voltaire to Gibbon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9bOow5IFUwC&amp;pg=PA133|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=5 June 1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-46533-5|pages=132–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was an orthodox '''four stages theory''' of society, the stages being:

# [[hunter-gatherer|hunting]];
# [[pasturage]];
# [[agriculture]]; and 
# [[commerce]].

This ladder-like ordering was taken to be a strict, linear progression, or [[unilineal evolution]]. Some [[economic determinism]] applied, in the sense that the baseline of subsistence was assumed to have a serious effect on social matters. The stages were supposed to represent progress on a moral level, as well as that of economic complexity. French as well as Scottish Enlightenment writers subscribed to such a pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Rosen|title=On Voluntary Servitude: False Consciousness and the Theory of Ideology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FBBEWlGOhSMC&amp;pg=PA117|accessdate=1 March 2013|year=1996|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-63779-5|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of this type of theory (three or four stages) is attributed to a number of European writers from the 1750s onwards, such as Adam Smith, [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]] and [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ter Ellingson|title=The Myth of the Noble Savage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nqE3IhkeWToC&amp;pg=PA159|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=17 December 2000|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-92592-2|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Scottish context it appears in works from 1758 by [[David Dalrymple, Lord Hailes|David Dalrymple]] and [[Lord Kames]]; it has been argued that their source was the Edinburgh lectures of Smith on [[jurisprudence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Knud Haakonssen|title=The Cambridge Companion to Adam Smith|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G6bhhU3iyhIC&amp;pg=PA225|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=6 March 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-77924-1|page=225 note 18.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France it was published at much the same time, also, by [[Claude Pierre Goujet]], [[Claude Adrien Helvétius]], and [[François Quesnay]].&lt;ref name="FitzpatrickJones2004"/&gt; Smith's "[[natural progress of opulence]]" is a closely related theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Noggle|title=The Temporality of Taste in Eighteenth-Century British Writing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mUT8187WaxkC&amp;pg=PA165|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=9 February 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-964243-4|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representative works==
Besides Adam Smith, prominent Scottish authors in the field of conjectural history included [[Adam Ferguson]], David Hume, Lord Kames, [[John Millar (philosopher)|John Millar]], and [[Lord Monboddo]], writing from the later 1750s to later 1770s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=William Zachs |title=Without Regard to Good Manners: A biography of Gilbert Stuart (1743–1786) |year=1992 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=978-0-7486-0319-0 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith, Kames and Millar were content to adhere to the four stage theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Porscha Fermanis|title=John Keats and the Ideas of the Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JhfJN8IzDOgC&amp;pg=PA67|accessdate=1 March 2013|year=2009|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-3780-5|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monboddo's stadial history was more complex, and very much more controversial. He included [[primate]]s and [[feral children]] as material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Broadie|title=The Cambridge Companion to the Scottish Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gtda5SVxaF4C&amp;pg=PA82|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=10 April 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-00323-0|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson in his ''History of America'' moves between narrative and conjectural history.&lt;ref&gt;Hopfl, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adam Ferguson, ''An Essay on the History of Civil Society'' (1767)===
{{details|An Essay on the History of Civil Society}}
Ferguson in this work attempted a rigorous identification of the hunter stage with the so-called [[barbarian]] or savage, and was very alive to the whole scheme as full of tensions within human possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Pocock, pp. 330–5.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued against the [[foundation story]] in the style of classical history, proposing instead that [[unintended consequences]] could have more to do with the "establishment" of a society than a self-conscious law-giver.&lt;ref&gt;Hopfl, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Millar, ''Observations concerning the Distinction of Ranks in Society'' (1771)===
Millar argued in terms of a "system of manners" associated with each of the four stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Chandler|title=England in 1819: The Politics of Literary Culture and the Case of Romantic Historicism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RqWLrZ3UEvcC&amp;pg=PA128|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=26 June 1999|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-10109-5|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also discussed the advance of freedom, and denounced slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynn Avery Hunt|title=Measuring Time, Making History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A6nrL1XxpGYC&amp;pg=PA60|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=28 February 2008|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=978-963-9776-14-2|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; As property became more complex, it followed that government did so also.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Porter |first=Roy |authorlink=Roy Porter |title=Enlightenment|year=2001 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-025028-2 |page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poovey states that this work makes apparent the relationship of conjectural history with the [[experimental moral philosophy]] of [[Thomas Reid]] and [[George Turnbull (theologian)|George Turnbull]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary Poovey|title=A History of the Modern Fact: Problems of Knowledge in the Sciences of Wealth and Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cf7ProAtFBkC&amp;pg=PA223|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=1 December 1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-67525-1|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lord Kames, ''Sketches of the History of Man'' (1774)===
Kames has been called the leader of Scottish conjectural history, and had objections he expressed in correspondence to both Rousseau and the approach of [[Montesquieu]], as reducing the role of human nature, which he thought was not a constant but the goal of the investigation.&lt;ref name="Carhart2007"/&gt; The connection was that conjectural history was to be used as a framework of a discussion of [[natural law]].&lt;ref name="O'Brien"/&gt; In writing to [[Basel]] in search of a suitable opponent to Rousseau, Kames prompted a work from [[Isaak Iselin]], ''Ueber die Geschichte der Menschheit'' (1764), which is also a conjectural history.&lt;ref name="Carhart2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Knud Haakonssen|title=The Cambridge History of Eighteenth-Century Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s6ExSHrknywC&amp;pg=PA1140|accessdate=2 March 2013|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-86743-6|page=1140 note 62.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Sketches'' was a collection of essays on social, cultural and political topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Sauer|title=Reading the Nation in English Literature: A Critical Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=blEcG669IWIC&amp;pg=PA92|accessdate=2 March 2013|year=2010|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-44524-5|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it the author collected some ethnographic and miscellaneous information, assembling in particular a long chapter intended as a "history of women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dr Alan Barnard|author2=Jonathan Spencer|title=Encyclopedia of Social and Cultural Anthropology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o1VpdrbH3BUC&amp;pg=PA280|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=1 September 2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-203-45803-7|page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank Trentmann|title=Paradoxes of Civil Society: New Perspectives on Modern German and British History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ry0AybYtwEC&amp;pg=PA69|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=1 October 2003|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-57181-143-1|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a second edition (Edinburgh, 1778) and a third (Dublin, 1779). Kames was an early [[polygenist]], or was an [[environmental monogenist]] only with scepticism about the adequacy of the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John P. Jackson, Jr.|author2=Nadine M.

==Later developments==

===The tradition comes to an end===
Mainstream conjectural and philosophical history, in the Scottish style, hardly survived as a living tradition into the 1790s. Works went out of print; younger authors such as [[John Adams (writer)|John Adams]], [[William Alexander (physician)|William Alexander]] and [[John Logan (minister)|John Logan]] failed to renew the ideas, with Alexander's ''History of Women'' (1779) being criticised as shallow.&lt;ref name="Broich"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ulrich Broich|title=Reactions to Revolutions: The 1790s and Their Aftermath|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vLvLPSwF-bIC&amp;pg=PA232|accessdate=3 March 2013|year=2007|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3-8258-7427-8|pages=232–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Salber Phillips|title=Society and Sentiment: Genres of Historical Writing in Britain, 1740–1820|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zZjGBmpk88C&amp;pg=PA163|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=1 May 2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-2362-8|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dugald Stewart's formulation of conjectural history was published in 1794, in his ''Account'' of Adam Smith for the ''Transactions'' of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Smith|title=The Glasgow Edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith: III: Essays on Philosophical Subjects: With Dugald Stewart's 'Account of Adam Smith':|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=48IO3cLjaWcC&amp;pg=PA268|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=1 May 1980|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-159117-4|page=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question has been raised as to Stewart's intention then in describing the tradition in that way, and [[John Burrow]] has argued that he wished to dissociate Smith from political radicalism.&lt;ref name="Burrow1966"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Wyon Burrow|title=Evolution and Society: A Study in Victorian Social Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OUM4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA54|accessdate=4 March 2013|year=1966|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-04393-9|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where stadial theory appeared in later authors, the original thrust was distorted.&lt;ref name="Broich"/&gt; Hopfl has said that the heirs were [[James Mill]], [[John Stuart Mill]], and [[Auguste Comte]].&lt;ref&gt;Hopfl, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Hawthorne writes instead of the historical/sociological insights of the Scots being lost in the British context, despite the "tension between a 'natural' account of civil society and a developing sense of the factual importance and moral difficulties of individualism" having become apparent, to [[utilitarianism]] and vaguer [[evolutionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Geoffrey Hawthorn |title=Enlightenment and Despair: A History of Social Theory |year=1987 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-33721-6 |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious opposition===
The ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', in its [[Encyclopædia Britannica Second Edition|second edition]] but particularly in its [[Encyclopædia Britannica Third Edition|third edition]] (1797), attacked the premises of conjectural history from a biblical angle. In the second edition [[James Tytler]] opposed the polygenist approach of Kames. The third edition, under the editorship of [[George Gleig]], featured "Savage" as a new topic, and expanded articles "Society" and "Moral philosophy". Cross-referenced to theological and biblical topics, and to articles by [[David Doig]] who had answered Kames with ''Two Letters on the Savage State'' from 1775/6, these articles in particular argued the orthodox Christian case. [[Robert Heron (writer)|Robert Heron]] contributed to the article "Society", and took aim at the four stages theory, claiming polygenism followed from it (in contradiction to the Bible). Further, the assumption of a baseline state of savagery also seemed to Heron to be implicated with polygenism; and he with Doig attacked the assumption as echoing [[Lucretius]] and [[Democritus]], and godless materialist [[spontaneous generation]] of humankind, implicit in the whole idea of conjectural history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Aa.vv.|title=Storia della Storiografia.

===Relationship to antiquarianism===
Conjectural argument had a bad name in 18th century British [[antiquarian]] circles. An austere and sceptical approach centred on facts, as adopted by [[Richard Gough (antiquarian)|Richard Gough]] and [[James Douglas (antiquary)|James Douglas]], was favoured in the second half of the century.&lt;ref name="Sweet"&gt;Sweet, pp. 20–3.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the interpretations of the stadial theory were quite welcome, and while popularised by the Scottish school, did not seem innovative in the sense of a break with Early Modern historiography, and concerns with natural law and [[civic humanism]]. The urban history of [[John Trussel]] was a precursor. The discussion of the breakdown of the [[feudal system]] was a topic of considerable antiquarian interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rosemary Sweet|title=Writing of Urban Histories in 18th Century England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n32ZwLcgaFUC&amp;pg=PA143|accessdate=3 March 2013|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-820669-9|pages=143–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadial history was embraced by [[Thomas Pownall]].&lt;ref name="Sweet"/&gt;

===Conjectural history of peoples===
[[Charles Athanase Walckenaer]] in 1798 took up the four stage theory, augmented to five stages, by dividing "hunting" into "gathering" followed by a pure hunting stage. This was an effort to classify peoples of the world by development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin S. Staum|title=Labeling People: French Scholars on Society, Race, and Empire, 1815–1848|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJfz4ptLD0kC&amp;pg=PA13|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=20 August 2003|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=978-0-7735-7124-2|pages=13–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early anthropology carried into the 19th century assumptions about the search for origins of civilisation, and unilineal evolution, as appropriate tools for investigating societies. It was widely assumed, further, that current "peoples" were a window into the past. These approaches were seen in [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]. Eventually, in the 20th century, field work and [[structural functionalism]] led to a rejection of the whole paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Giorgio Ausenda|title=After Empire: Towards an Ethnology of Europe's Barbarians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wqvhYaHrryEC&amp;pg=PA96|accessdate=5 March 2013|date=1 February 2003|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|isbn=978-0-85115-853-2|pages=96–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''conjectural portrait''' is a [[portrait]] made of a historical figure for whom no authentic contemporary portrait is available.  The depiction, then, may be variously informed by [[primary source|written accounts]] of [[Human physical appearance|physical appearance]], conjecture based on the subject's culture and background, and/or the artist's conception of the subject's [[Moral character|inner essence]].

==Iconic portraits==
Certain conjectural portraits have become [[iconography|iconic]] of their subjects, and are widely recognizable as such, with few being aware that they are not authentic portraits.  For example, portraits of [[Christopher Columbus]] and [[Joan of Arc]] are widely recognized.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4827">The '''criterion of dissimilarity''' (also called '''criterion of discontinuity''')&lt;ref&gt;''Who Is Jesus?'' by Thomas P. Rausch (Jul 1, 2003) {{ISBN|0814650783}} page 36&lt;/ref&gt; is used in [[Biblical criticism]] to determine if a statement attributed to Jesus may be authentic. It is often used as a shorthand for the '''criterion of double dissimilarity'''.&lt;ref name=Gregg29 &gt;''The Historical Jesus and the Final Judgment Sayings in Q'' (Wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen Zum Neuen Testament) by Brian Han Gregg (Jun 30, 2006) {{ISBN|3161487508}} page 29&lt;/ref&gt;  The criterion states that if a saying attributed to Jesus is different from the Jewish traditions of his time and also from the early Church that followed him, it is likely to be authentic.&lt;ref name=Gregg29 /&gt;

==Description==

The criterion of dissimilarity was introduced by [[Ernst Käsemann]], who in 1953 started the second [[quest for the historical Jesus]].&lt;ref name=GerdD122&gt;''The Quest for the Plausible Jesus: The Question of Criteria'' by Gerd Theissen and Dagmar Winter (Aug 30, 2002) {{ISBN|0664225373}} page 122&lt;/ref&gt; Käsemann writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[T]here is an almost complete lack of satisfactory and water-tight criteria for this material. In only one case do we have more or less safe ground under our feet: when there are no grounds either for deriving a tradition from Judaism or for ascribing it to primitive Christianity, and especially when Jewish Christianity has mitigated or modified the received tradition, as having been too bold for its taste. (Käsemann, ''Essays on New Testament Themes'', p. 37)&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Tim Widowfield, [http://vridar.org/2014/04/23/defending-the-criterion-of-dissimilarity/ "Defending the criterion of dissimilarity"] (''Vridar'' blog post), 2014-04-23. Retrieved 2017-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, the criterion postulates that traditions about Jesus derive from (only) three sources: extrapolation from earlier Jewish traditions, revisionism by the early Christian Church, and true historical accounts of Jesus's ministry. If some tradition cannot be adequately explained by extrapolation nor by revisionism, then it must necessarily be a trace of the historical Jesus.

== Limitations ==

The criterion has received criticism for leading to reconstructions of Jesus as being in implausible discontinuity with the early Jewish traditions that preceded him and the early Christian traditions that followed from him. One such critic writes: "The problem of the Criterion of Double Dissimilarity is that the more we know about early Jewish traditions and the more we know about early Christian post-Easter traditions, the less space there is for a reconstruction of the authentic sayings of Jesus, as by definition they have to differ from early Jewish and early Christian traditions. Therefore, in the end, no trace of a historical Jesus remains."&lt;ref&gt;Oegema, Gerbern S. ''Apocalyptic Interpretation of the Bible''. 2012. pg. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more fundamental criticism of the criterion of dissimiliarity was identified by [[Richard Carrier]]. He identifies two fundamental flaws in the validity of the criterion:

# We are severely limited in our ability to know fundamental details about [[Second Temple Judaism|second-temple Judaism]] and the early Christian church due to an almost total destruction and neglect of documentary records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/747547724|title=The criteria for authenticity in historical-Jesus research : previous discussion and new proposals|last=1956-|first=Porter, Stanley E.,|date=2000|publisher=Sheffield Academic Press|isbn=9780567520982|location=Sheffield, England|oclc=747547724}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Tuckett concurs: "The very existence of the tradition may thus mitigate against its being regarded as 'dissimilar' to the views of 'the early church.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/60362885|title=The Cambridge companion to Jesus|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Bockmuehl, Markus N. A.|isbn=0521792614|location=Cambridge|oclc=60362885}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# There is no valid method for distinguishing between a dissimilar statement of Jesus that was actually said and a dissimilar statement of Jesus that was invented by later authors. Any motivation to preserve a dissimilar statement is also motivation to invent one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/764387191|title=Proving history : Bayes's theorem and the quest for the historical Jesus|last=1969-|first=Carrier, Richard,|date=2012|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=9781616145590|location=Amherst, N.Y.|oclc=764387191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edelin''' (?–1293) ruled over the [[Alsace|Alsatian]] [[Weissenburg Abbey (Alsace)|abbey of Weissenburg]] as its [[abbot]] from the year 1262 until his death on 15 October 1293. During his time of office, work started on the [[Gothic (architecture)|Gothic]] abbey church which still stands today. Because the monastery had had the majority of its possessions confiscated since the 10th century, Edelin had an inventory of estates prepared, using older documents, called the ''[[Codex Edelini]]'' or ''Liber Possessionum'', in order to index the existing estate and prevent further losses (which, as it turned, out was not successful).

==Early life==
Esther was born in [[Bridgewater, Vermont]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zgs_AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA111&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;dq=Esther+Sumner+Damon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PsAiGDS6ld&amp;sig=JMWVestrnSzSSFv8zW3KJAQ95Ok&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiBjPPhrM_QAhVHlVQKHVbrDjcQ6AEIRTAL#v=onepage&amp;q=Esther%20Sumner%20Damon&amp;f=false|title=Granite State Magazine|date=1907-01-01|publisher=Granite State Publishing Company|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The family had eight or nine children.&lt;ref name="Bayles" /&gt;  Esther's father was killed by a falling tree when she was eight years old.&lt;ref name="Bayles" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Esther attended school during the winter and worked during the summers to help support her family.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  At the age of seventeen, Esther became a [[school teacher]] in [[Plymouth, Vermont|Plymouth]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Marriage==
Esther Sumner married Noah D. Damon on September 6, 1835, in Bridgewater,  when she was 21 and he was 75.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The couple had met two weeks prior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Husband's war enlistment==
Noah Damon enlisted in the [[Continental Army]] on April 19, 1775.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  He was intermittently enlisted over the next five years.&lt;ref name="Bayles" /&gt;  Noah applied for a war pension, as a resident of [[Plainfield, New Hampshire]] on November 13, 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.genealogybank.com/tag/esther-sumner-damon |title=Esther (Sumner) Damon Genealogy &amp; Ancestry Articles {{!}} GenealogyBank Blog |date=2015-09-05 |access-date=2016-11-30 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905124822/http://blog.genealogybank.com/tag/esther-sumner-damon |archivedate=2015-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noah was penniless, though Esther may have thought he was a hardworking landowner.&lt;ref name="Bayles" /&gt;  Esther supported him for three years before financial necessity forced him to move in with his daughter in New Hampshire.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Esther supported herself by sewing and nursing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  She also leased a farm near [[Reading, Vermont|Reading]].&lt;ref name="Bayles" /&gt;

{{Anthropology}}
'''Ethnohistory''' is the study of cultures and [[indigenous peoples]]' customs by examining historical records as well as other sources of information on their lives and history. It is also the study of the history of various [[ethnic group]]s that may or may not still exist. The term is most commonly used in writing about the [[history of the Americas]].

Ethnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data as its foundation. Its historical methods and materials go beyond the standard use of documents and manuscripts. Practitioners recognize the use of such source material as maps, music, paintings, photography, folklore, oral tradition, site exploration, archaeological materials, museum collections, enduring customs, language, and placenames.&lt;ref name="Axtell1979"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Axtell | first1 = J. | year = 1979 | title = Ethnohistory: An Historian's Viewpoint | url = | journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 3–4 | doi=10.2307/481465| jstor = 481465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical development ==
Scholars studying the history of [[Mexico]]'s indigenous have a long tradition, dating back to the colonial era; they used alphabetic texts and other sources to write the history of Mexico's indigenous peoples. The ''[[Handbook of Middle American Indians]]'', edited by archeologist [[Robert Wauchope (archaeologist)|Robert Wauchope]] was involved with creating a multiple volumes on [[Mesoamerican]] ethnohistory, published as ''Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources'', appearing in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of Middle American Indians, Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources'', volumes 12-16, Howard F. Cline, general editor. Austin: University of Texas Press 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time that the volumes were published, "both the term 'ethnohistory' and its concepts in the sense used here have entered the literature rather recently and are not fully agreed upon."&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Cline, "Introduction: Reflections on Ethnohistory" in ''Handbook of Middle American Indians, Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources'', vol. 12, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The volumes were intended to be an inventory of sources "which in later hands could utilize to produce professionally acceptable ethnohistory."&lt;ref&gt;Cline, "Introduction: Reflections on Ethnohistory", p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid to late 20th century, a number of ethnohistorians of Mexico began to systematically publish many colonial alphabetic texts in indigenous Mexican languages, in a branch of ethnohistory currently known as the [[New Philology]]. That built on an earlier tradition of practitioners writing the [[history of Mexico]] that fully integrated the history of its indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;James Lockhart, "[[Charles Gibson]] and the Ethnohistory of Postconquesst Central Mexico" in ''Nahuas and Spaniards: Postconquest Central Mexican History and Philology.'' Stanford University Press and UCLA Latin American Studies, vol. 76. 1991, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Restall, Matthew, "A History of the New Philology and the New Philology in History", ''Latin American Research Review'' - Volume 38, Number 1, 2003, pp.113–134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html | title=Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory, Provisional Version, James Lockhart, Lisa Sousa, and Stephanie Wood, editors (2007)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the field arose out of the study of American Indian communities required by the [[Indian Claims Commission]]. It gained a pragmatic rather than a theoretical orientation, with practitioners testifying both for and against Indian claims. The emerging methodology used documentary historical sources and ethnographic methods. Among the scholars working on the cases was Latin Americanist [[Howard F. Cline]], who was commissioned to work on Florda Indians and [[Jicarilla Apache]].  

The field has also reached into [[Melanesia]], where recent European contact allowed researchers to observe the early postcontact period directly and to address important theoretical questions. [[Michael Harkin]] argues that ethnohistory was part of the general rapprochement between history and anthropology in the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Harkin, "Ethnohistory's Ethnohistory," ''Social Science History,'' Summer 2010, Vol. 34#2 pp 113-128&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnohistory grew organically thanks to external nonscholarly pressures, without an overarching figure or conscious plan; even so, it came to engage central issues in cultural and historical analysis. Ethnohistorians take pride in using their special knowledge of specific groups, their linguistic insights, and their interpretation of cultural phenomena. They claim to achieve a more in-depth analysis than the average historian is capable of doing based solely on written documents produced by and for one group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lurie | first1 = N. | year = 1961 | title = Ethnohistory: An Ethnological Point of View | url = | journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 8 | issue = 1| page = 83 | doi=10.2307/480349| jstor = 480349 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They try to understand culture on its own terms and according to its own cultural code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/482586 | last1 = DeMallie | first1 = Raymond J. | year = 1993 | title = These Have No Ears": Narrative and the Ethnohistorical Method | jstor = 482586| journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 40 | issue = 4| pages = 515–538}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnohistory differs from other historically-related [[methodology|methodologies]] in that it embraces [[emic]] perspectives as tools of analysis. The field and its techniques are well suited for writing histories of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] peoples because of its holistic and inclusive framework. It is especially important because of its ability to bridge differing frameworks and access a more informed context for interpretations of the past.

The definition of the field has become more refined over the years. Early on, ethnohistory differed from history proper in that it added a new dimension, specifically "the critical use of ethnological concepts and materials in the examination and use of historical source material," as described by [[William N. Fenton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fenton | first1 = W. N. | year = 1966 | title = Field Work, Museum Studies, and Ethnohistorical Research | url = | journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 13 | issue = 1/2| page = 75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[James Axtell]] described ethnohistory as "the use of historical and ethnological methods to gain knowledge of the nature and causes of change in a culture defined by ethnological concepts and categories."&lt;ref name="Axtell1979" /&gt; Others have focused this basic concept on previously ignored historical actors. [[Ed Schieffelin]] asserted, for example, that ethnohistory must fundamentally take into account the people's own sense of how events are constituted, and their ways of culturally constructing the past.&lt;ref&gt;Schieffelin, E. and D. Gewertz (1985), ''History and Ethnohistory in Papua New Guinea'', 3&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Simmons formulated his understanding of ethnohistory as "a form of cultural biography that draws upon as many kinds of testimony as possible over as long a time period as the sources allow." He described ethnohistory as an endeavor based on a [[holistic]], [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] approach that is most rewarding when it can be "joined to the memories and voices of living people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simmons | first1 = W. S. | year = 1988 | title = Culture Theory in Contemporary Ethnohistory | url = http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/2k09f06d| journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 35 | issue = 1| page = 10 | doi=10.2307/482430| jstor = 482430 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting upon the history of ethnohistory as research field in the US, Harkin has situated it within the broader context of convergences and divergences of the fields of history and anthropology and the special circumstances of American Indian land claims and legal history in North American in the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1215/01455532-2009-022 | last1 = Harkin | first1 = Michael | year = 2010 | title = Ethnohistory's Ethnohistory: Creating a Discipline from the Ground Up | url = | journal = Social Science History | volume = 34 | issue = 2| pages = 113–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7363">A '''family history society''' or '''genealogical society''' is a [[society]], often [[Charitable organization|charitable]] or [[not-for-profit]], that allows member [[genealogist]]s and [[family history|family historian]]s to profit from shared knowledge.  Large societies often own libraries, sponsor research seminars and foreign trips, and publish journals. Some societies concentrate on a specific niche, such as the family history of a particular geographical area, [[ethnicity]], [[nationality]], or [[religion]].  Lineage societies are societies that limit their membership to descendants of a particular person or group of people of historical importance.

{{Genocide of Indigenous peoples}}
There are 17 indigenous tribes in [[Paraguay]] with the majority having their territories in the Chaco region. Tribes in this region include the [[Guaraní people|Guaraní]], [[Ayoreo people|Ayoreo]], Toba-Maskoy, [[Aché people|Aché]] and Sanapan which according to the census from 2002 number an estimated 86,000 or roughly around 2 per cent of the total population. These peoples have faced persecution particularly under the dictator [[Alfredo Strossner]] that some observers call a '''Genocide of indigenous peoples in Paraguay.'''
==Repression under Alfredo Stroessner==
Between 1956 and 1989, while under the military rule of General [[Alfredo Stroessner]], the indigenous population had more territory taken than at any other period in Paraguay's history and were subjected to systematic human rights abuses. In 1971, Mark Münzel, a German anthropologist accused Stroessner of attempted genocide against the indigenous peoples of Paraguay{{sfn|Münzel|1973|p=5}} and Bartomeu Melià, a [[Jesuit]] anthropologist stated that the forced relocations of the indigenous peoples was [[ethnocide]].{{sfn|Becker|2010}} In the early 1970s the Stroessner regime was charged by international groups of being complicit in genocide. However, because of the repressive actions undertaken by the state the indigenous tribes organized themselves politically and had a major role in bringing about the end of the military dictatorship and the eventual transition to democracy.{{sfn|Minority Rights Group International|2007}}{{sfn|Becker|2010}}{{sfn|Horst|2003|p=104}}
==Destruction of the Ache tribe==
During the 1960s and 1970s, 85 percent of the Aché tribe died, with many hacked to death with machetes to make room for the timber industry, mining, farming and ranchers.{{sfn|Churchill|2000|p=433}} One estimate posits this amounts to 900 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1023.4008&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf
Victims of State:Genocide, Politicides and Group Repression Since 1945
Page 26
Babara Haff &amp; Ted Robert Gurr&lt;/ref&gt;According to Jérémie Gilbert, the situation in Paraguay has proven that it is difficult to provide the proof required to show "specific intent", in support of a claim that genocide had occurred. The Aché, whose cultural group is now seen as extinct, fell victim to the development by the state, who had promoted the exploration of Aché territory by transnational companies for natural resources. Gilbert concludes that though planned and voluntary destruction had occurred, it is argued by the state that there was no intent to destroy the Aché, as what had happened was due to development.{{sfn|Gilbert|2006|p=118}}

==Assessment of persecution as a genocide==
The allegation of genocide by the state was brought before the [[Inter-American Human Rights Commission]] which has jurisdiction on allegations of genocide carried out by a state. The commission gave a provisional ruling that Paraguay had not carried out a genocide, but stated it had concerns over "possible abuses by private persons in remote areas of the territory of Paraguay".{{sfn|Quigley|2006|p=125}}

'''Heraldic visitations''' were tours of inspection undertaken by [[King of Arms|Kings of Arms]] (and more often by junior [[Officer of arms|officers of arms (or Heralds)]] as deputies) throughout [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Ireland]]. Their purpose was to regulate and register the [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] of [[nobility]] and [[gentry]] and [[borough]]s, and to record [[Pedigree chart|pedigree]]s. They took place from 1530 to 1688, and their records (akin to an [[upper class]] [[census]]) provide important source material for [[historian]]s and [[genealogy|genealogists]].

==Visitations in England==

===Process of visitations===
[[Image:English heraldic visitations map.png|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Map showing the number of visitations by the [[King of Arms]] to [[England]]'s counties, taken from ''Burke's Landed Gentry'', 1937 edition]]
By the fifteenth century, the use and abuse of [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] was becoming widespread in [[England]]. One of the duties conferred on [[William Bruges]] (or [[Brydges]]), the first [[Garter Principal King of Arms]] was to survey and record the [[Coat of arms|armorial bearings]] and [[Pedigree chart|pedigree]]s of those using coats of arms and correct irregularities. [[officer of arms|Officers of arms]] had made occasional tours of various parts of the kingdom to enquire about armorial matters during the fifteenth century,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Friar, Ed. ''A Dictionary of Heraldry''. (Harmony Books, New York: 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; however, it was not until the sixteenth century that the process began in earnest.

The first provincial visitations were carried out under [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] granted by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] to [[Thomas Benolt]], [[Clarenceux King of Arms]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/2/101002134/ www.oxforddnb.com]&lt;/ref&gt; dated 6 April 1530.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Franklyn. ''Shield and Crest: An Account of the Art and Science of Heraldry''. (MacGibbon &amp; Kee, London: 1960), 386.&lt;/ref&gt; He was commissioned to travel throughout his province (i.e. south of the [[River Trent|Trent]]) with authority to enter all homes and churches. Upon entering these premises, he was authorized to "put down or otherwise deface at his discretion... those [[coat of arms|arms]] unlawfully used".&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Vivian, Ed. ''The Visitations of Cornwall, Comprising the Heralds' Visitations of 1530, 1573, &amp;1620''. (William Pollard and Co., Exeter: 1887), 248.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also required to enquire into all those using the titles of [[knight]], [[esquire]], or [[gentleman]] and decided if they were being lawfully used.

By this [[writ]], Henry VIII also compelled the [[sheriff]]s and [[mayor]]s of each [[county]] or [[city]] visited by the [[officer of arms|officers of arms]] to give aid and assistance in gathering the needed information. When a [[King of Arms]], or Herald, visited a county, his presence was proclaimed by presenting the King's royal commission to the local gentry and nobility, which required them to provide evidence of their right to use a [[coat of arms]]. The [[High Sheriff|Sheriff]] would collect from the [[bailiff]] of each [[Hundred (county division)|hundred]] within his county a list of all people using [[title]]s or arms. 

In the early days, the visiting herald would tour the homes of the gentry and nobility, but from the late 1560s these persons were summoned to attend a central "place of sitting" – usually an inn – at a particular time.&lt;ref&gt;Ailes 2009, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; They were to bring their arms, and proof of their right to use them, most often by way of detailing their ancestral right to them, which would also be recorded. Where an official [[grant of arms]] had been made, this was also recorded. Other ancient arms, many of which predated the establishment of the [[College of Arms]], were confirmed. The [[officer of arms|officer]] would record the information clearly and make detailed notes that could be entered into the records of the College of Arms when the party returned to [[London]]. 

These volumes now make up the collection of Visitation Books at the College, which contain a wealth of information about all armigerous people from the period.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner 1952, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; If the officers of arms were not presented with sufficient proof of the right to use a coat of arms, they were also empowered to deface monuments which bore these arms and to force persons bearing such arms to sign a disclaimer that they would cease using them. The visitations were not always popular with members of the landed gentry, who were required to present proof of their gentility.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Following the accession of [[William III of England|William III]] in 1689, no further commissions to carry out visitations were commanded. The reasons behind this cessation of the programme have been a matter of debate among historians. Philip Styles, for example, related it to a declining willingness of members of the gentry to attend visitations, which he traced to a growing proportion of "[[parvenu|newly risen]]" families, who lacked long pedigrees and were therefore apathetic about registering them.&lt;ref&gt;Styles 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Janet Verasano has challenged this interpretation, finding that (in Staffordshire, at least) gentry enthusiasm for coats of arms as an enhancement to social standing persisted to the end of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Verasano 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The end of the visitations did not have much effect on those counties far removed from London, some of which had only been rarely visited over the entire period of the visitations.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

There was never a systematic visitation of Wales. There were four visitations in the principality, and on 9 June 1551, Fulk ap Hywel, [[Lancaster Herald|Lancaster Herald of Arms in Ordinary]] was given a commission to visit all of Wales. This was not carried out, however, as he was degraded and executed for counterfeiting the seal of [[Clarenceux King of Arms]]. This is regrettable, since no visitation of all Wales was ever made by the officers of arms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Siddons|Michael Powell Siddons]]. ''Visitations by the Heralds in Wales''. (The Harleian Society, London: 1996), v.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Records===
[[Image:Thomas Hawley Clarenceux King of Arms.jpg|thumb|right|[[Thomas Hawley]], [[Clarenceux King of Arms]], wearing a [[tabard]] displaying the [[Royal arms of England]]; the manuscripts from his first tour of London are the earliest existing records of an English visitation.]]
The principal records to emerge from the visitations were pedigrees, initially recorded on loose sheets of paper, and afterwards bound together as notebooks. In some cases, the sheets would include blank shields which had been drawn in advance (or at a later date printed), to simplify the process of recording coats of arms.&lt;ref name="Wag p167"&gt;Wagner 1967, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ailes 2014, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; The persons whose pedigrees were recorded were required (from about 1570 onwards) to certify them by signature, and where these original draft pedigrees have survived they are known as "originals with signatures".&lt;ref&gt;Wagner 1952, pp. 58–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ailes 2009, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The signed copies were taken back to the College of Arms, where fair copies were made to a higher standard and preserved as the "office copies".&lt;ref name="Wag p167"/&gt; Sometimes the signed copies were also retained at the College, but in other cases, no longer considered of official interest, they might pass into private hands: once in general circulation, further copies were often made, which might in turn be revised or augmented. As a result, a number of variant manuscript copies of any one visitation record may now survive, possessing varying degrees of accuracy and authority.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner 1952, pp. 24–5, 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ailes 2014, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Harleian Collection]] of the [[British Library]] is particularly rich in such records. Many visitation records have been published over the years, by the [[Harleian Society]], by county [[Text publication society|record societies]], and a few privately (see [[Heraldic visitation#Published editions|listing below]]). However, because until relatively recently the College of Arms restricted access to its records, many of the older published editions were necessarily based on the unofficial second- or third-generation copies in other collections, and may therefore not always be reliable.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner 1952, pp. 18, 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

From as early as the 1530s, officers of arms on visitation frequently also compiled what were known as "church notes". These were [[fieldnotes]] (usually in the form of sketches) of coats of arms observed on [[English church monuments|church monuments]], in [[stained glass]] windows, or on display in private houses.&lt;ref name="Wag52 pp61-2"&gt;Wagner 1952, pp. 61–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner 1967, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ailes 2009, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, drawings were also made of non-heraldic antiquities, such as medieval architectural features, views of towns, Roman inscriptions and even [[Stonehenge]].&lt;ref name="Wag52 pp61-2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=T.D. |last=Kendrick |authorlink=T. D. Kendrick |title=British Antiquity |year=1950 |location=London |publisher=Methuen |pages=156–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lankester |first=Philip J. |year=1993 |title=Two lost effigial monuments in Yorkshire and the evidence of church notes |journal=Church Monuments |volume=8 |pages=25–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ailes 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 17th-century visitations generated a growing number of supplementary papers, including warrants, lists of persons who disclaimed any pretence to arms, lists of persons summoned to appear before the heralds (including those who had not appeared), records of fees paid, and miscellaneous correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;For examples, see {{cite book |editor1-first=George |editor1-last=Ireland |editor2-last=Squibb |editor2-first=G.D. |editor2-link=George Drewry Squibb |title=Dugdale's Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Visitation Papers |place=London |series=Harleian Society, new ser. |volume=6 |year=1987 |ISBN=0-9500207-8-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lists of visitations===
Visitations were conducted by or in the name of the two provincial [[King of Arms|Kings of Arms]], [[Clarenceux King of Arms|Clarenceux]] and [[Norroy and Ulster King of Arms|Norroy]], within their respective provinces. In the following lists, the Deputies are the officers of arms who actually carried out the visitations. Where no Deputy is named, the visitation can be assumed to have been conducted by the King of Arms in person.

====Southern Province====
The Southern Province, the jurisdiction of Clarenceux King of Arms, comprised that part of [[England]] south of the [[River Trent]], i.e. the counties of [[Bedfordshire|Bedford]], [[Berkshire|Berks]], [[Buckinghamshire|Buckingham]], [[Cambridgeshire|Cambridge]], [[Cornwall]], [[Devon]], [[Dorset]], [[Essex]], [[Gloucestershire|Gloucester]], [[Herefordshire|Hereford]], [[Hertfordshire|Hertford]], [[Huntingdonshire|Huntingdon]], [[Kent]], [[Leicestershire|Leicester]], [[Lincolnshire|Lincoln]], [[Middlesex]], [[Monmouthshire|Monmouth]], [[Norfolk]], [[Northamptonshire|Northampton]], [[Oxfordshire|Oxford]], [[Rutland]], [[Shropshire|Salop]], [[Somerset]], [[Hampshire|Southampton]], [[Suffolk]], [[Surrey]], [[Sussex]], [[Warwickshire|Warwick]], [[Wiltshire|Wilton]], [[Worcestershire|Worcester]], and the [[City of London]]; and [[South Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;Listings are based on Wagner 1952, pp. 66–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Northern Province====
The Northern Province, the jurisdiction of Norroy King of Arms, comprised that part of England north of the River Trent, i.e. the counties of [[Cheshire|Chester]], [[Cumberland]], [[Derbyshire|Derby]], [[County Durham|Durham]], [[Lancashire|Lancaster]], [[Northumberland]], [[Nottinghamshire|Nottingham]], [[Staffordshire|Stafford]], [[Westmorland]] and [[Yorkshire|York]]; and [[North Wales]]. The Trent ran through Staffordshire, and the county was therefore technically divided between the two provinces; but for the purposes of visitation it was generally treated (sometimes through a process of deputation) as falling under the jurisdiction of Norroy.&lt;ref&gt;Listings are based on Wagner 1952, pp. 77–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visitations in Ireland==
{{Refimprove|date=May 2016}}
Since the practices of [[Ulster King of Arms]] so closely followed those of the English College of Arms, it is hardly surprising that the Irish officers of arms undertook heraldic visitations in their province. The purpose behind these visitations was twofold: to prevent the assumption of arms by unqualified people, and to record the arms of the gentry that were unknown to Ulster office. The first visitation was held by [[Nicholas Narbon]], the second [[Ulster King of Arms]], in 1569. He was authorized to reform practices which were contrary to good armorial practice. He conducted six visitations ([[Dublin]] in 1568&amp;ndash;1573, [[Drogheda]] and [[Ardee]] in 1570, Dublin in 1572, [[Swords, Dublin|Swords]] in 1572, [[Cork (city)|Cork]] in 1574, and [[Limerick]] in 1574). One of his successors, [[Daniel Molyneux]] had the commission renewed, and mounted several visitations. Although Molyneux's last visitation – of [[Wexford]] – was the last proper visitation, two other expeditions occurred after 1618 by subsequent Ulster Kings of Arms. The visitations were not very extensive. The officers would not often be found in the disturbed countryside. Thus the visitations are confined to areas under firm control of the [[Dublin]] administration.

Today, the original visitation and related manuscripts are in the custody of the [[Chief Herald of Ireland]]. Copies are also deposited at the College of Arms in London.

Non-Christian sources used to study and establish the historicity of Jesus include the Jewish historian [[Josephus]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]] historian [[Tacitus]].

The fourth gospel, the [[Gospel of John]], differs greatly from the Synoptic Gospels. Historians often study the [[historical reliability of the Acts of the Apostles]] when studying the reliability of the gospels, as the [[Book of Acts]] was seemingly written by the same author as the Gospel of Luke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Joel B.|title=Dictionary of Jesus and the Gospels|date=2013|publisher=IVP Academic|isbn=978-0830824564|page=541|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians subject the gospels to critical analysis by differentiating authentic, reliable information from possible inventions, exaggerations, and alterations.&lt;ref name = "Sanders"&gt;Sanders, E. P. ''The historical figure of Jesus''. Penguin, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Since there are more [[textual variants in the New Testament]] (200–400 thousand) than it has [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] (c. 140 thousand),&lt;ref&gt;[[Bart D. Ehrman]]: ''[[Misquoting Jesus|Misquoting Jesus – The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why]]'', p. 90 [http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/jma/nts-mss_5_arlandson.pdf (review)].&lt;/ref&gt; scholars use [[textual criticism]] to determine which gospel variants could theoretically be taken as 'original'. To answer this question, scholars have to ask [[Historicity of the canonical Gospels#Authorship and date|who wrote the gospels]], when they wrote them, what was their objective in writing them,&lt;ref name="Rhodes-Eddy08"&gt;Paul Rhodes Eddy &amp; Gregory A. Boyd, ''The Jesus Legend: A Case for the Historical Reliability of the Synoptic Jesus Tradition.'' (2008, Baker Academic). 309-262.&lt;/ref&gt; what sources the authors used, how reliable these sources were, and how far removed in time the sources were from the stories they narrate, or if they were altered later. Scholars may also look into the [[Historicity of the canonical Gospels#Historical reliability of the Gospels|internal evidence]] of the documents, to see if, for example, a document has misquoted texts from the Hebrew [[Tanakh]], has made incorrect claims about geography, if the author appears to have hidden information, or if the author has fabricated a prophecy.&lt;ref name="nazorene"&gt;The [[Gospel of Matthew]] claims, the [[Nazarene (title)|title Nazarene]] for Jesus was derived from the prophecy "He will be called a Nazorean" ({{bibleref2|Matthew|2:22–23|NRSV}}), despite the lack of any [[Old Testament]] source.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, scholars turn to external sources, including the [[Historicity of the canonical Gospels#Preserved by the church|testimony of early church leaders]], to writers [[Historicity of the canonical Gospels#Outside of the church|outside the church]], primarily Jewish and Greco-Roman historians, who would have been more likely to have criticized the church, and to archaeological evidence.

Watts 1999 {{ISBN|0664258425}} pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Casey35"&gt;''Jesus of Nazareth: An Independent Historian's Account of His Life and Teaching'' by Maurice Casey 2010 {{ISBN|0-567-64517-7}} p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this criterion, given that John baptised for the remission of [[sin]]s, and Jesus was viewed as without sin, the invention of this story would have served no purpose, and would have been an embarrassment given that it positioned John above Jesus.&lt;ref name="Powell47"&gt;''Jesus as a figure in history: how modern historians view the man from Galilee'' by Mark Allan Powell 1998 {{ISBN|0-664-25703-8}} p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Casey35" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The historical Jesus: a comprehensive guide'' by Gerd Theissen, Annette Merz 1998 {{ISBN|0-8006-3122-6}} p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amy-Jill Levine]] has summarized the situation by stating that "there is a consensus of sorts on the basic outline of Jesus' life" in that most scholars agree that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist, and over a period of one to three years debated Jewish authorities on the subject of God, gathered followers, and was crucified by [[Roman governor|Roman prefect]] Pontius Pilate who officiated 26–36 AD.&lt;ref name=AmyJill4&gt;{{cite book|author1=Amy-Jill Levine|author2=Dale C. Allison Jr.|author3=John Dominic Crossan|title=The Historical Jesus in Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wMbEyeDSQQgC|date=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages= 4|isbn=0-691-00992-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is much in dispute as to his previous life, childhood, family and place of residence, of which the [[canonical gospels]] are almost completely silent.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenmann, Robert, (2001), "James the Brother of Jesus: The Key to Unlocking the Secrets of Early Christianity and the Dead Sea Scrolls"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Butz, Jeffrey (2005), "The Brother of Jesus and the Lost Traditions of Christianity" (Inner Traditions)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tabor, James (2012), "Paul and Jesus: How the Apostle Transformed Christianity" (Simon &amp; Schuster)&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars attribute varying levels of certainty to other episodes. Some assume that there are eight elements about Jesus and his followers that can be viewed as historical facts, namely:&lt;ref name=Hertzog1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Evans37&gt;''Authenticating the Activities of Jesus'' by Bruce Chilton and Craig A. Evans 2002 {{ISBN|0391041649}} pp. 3–7&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jesus was a Galilean Jew.
* His activities were confined to Galilee and Judea.
* He was baptized by John the Baptist.
* He called disciples.
* He had a controversy at the Temple.
* Jesus was crucified by the Romans near Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=Hertzog1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Evans37/&gt;
* After his death his disciples continued.
* Some of his disciples were persecuted.&lt;ref name=Hertzog1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Evans37/&gt;

Since the 18th century, three separate scholarly [[Quest for the historical Jesus|quests for the historical Jesus]] have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria, which were often developed during that phase.&lt;ref name=BenQ9&gt;Ben Witherington, ''The Jesus Quest: The Third Search for the Jew of Nazareth'' (May 8, 1997) {{ISBN|0830815449}} pp. 9–13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AlanP19&gt;''Jesus as a Figure in History: How Modern Historians View the Man from Galilee'' by Mark Allan Powell (1 Jan 1999) {{ISBN|0664257038}} pp. 19–23&lt;/ref&gt; The portraits of Jesus that have been constructed in these processes have often differed from each other, and from the dogmatic image portrayed in the gospel accounts.&lt;ref name=Ehrman285/&gt;&lt;ref name=GerdD5/&gt;

[[File:CompositeJesus.JPG|thumb|left|190px|In the 21st century, the third [[quest for the historical Jesus]] witnessed a fragmentation of the scholarly [[Portrait (literature)|portraits]] of Jesus.&lt;ref name=GerdD5&gt;''The Quest for the Plausible Jesus: The Question of Criteria'' by Gerd Theissen and Dagmar Winter (Aug 30, 2002) {{ISBN|0664225373}} p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Charlesworth2&gt;''Jesus Research: An International Perspective (Princeton-Prague Symposia Series on the Historical Jesus)'' by James H.

Currently modern scholarly research on the historical Jesus focuses on what is historically probable, or plausible about Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;''John, Jesus, and History'' Volume 1 by Paul N.

Ordinarily the criteria can not hope to do more."&lt;/ref&gt;

The mainstream profiles in the third quest may be grouped together based on their primary theme as ''apocalyptic prophet'', ''charismatic healer'', ''Cynic philosopher'', ''Jewish Messiah'' and ''prophet of social change'',&lt;ref name=Cradel124&gt;''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' by Andreas J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10489">{{about|historism as a philosophical and historiographical theory on historicity and awareness of the past|the similarly used term historicism|historicism|the method of interpreting the biblical apocalypse|historicism (Christian eschatology)|a school of art and architecture|historicism (art)}}
'''Historism''' is a philosophical and historiographical theory, founded in 19th-century&lt;ref name="Spirkin" /&gt; [[Germany]] (as ''Historismus'') and especially influential in 19th- and 20th-century [[Europe]]. In those times there was not a single natural, humanitarian or philosophical science that would not reflect, in one way or another, the historical type of thought (cf. [[comparative historical linguistics]] etc.).&lt;ref name="Spirkin" /&gt; It pronounces the [[historicity]] of humanity and its binding to tradition.

Historist [[historiography]] rejects historical [[teleology]] and bases its explanations of historical phenomena on sympathy and understanding (see [[Hermeneutics]]) for the events, acting persons, and [[historical period]]s. The historist approach takes to its extreme limits the common observation that human institutions (language, Art, religion, law, State) are subject to perpetual change.&lt;ref name="CrDSoc"&gt;[[Raymond Boudon]] and [[François Bourricaud]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=O9ae9kWCtHkC&amp;pg=PA198 ''A Critical Dictionary of Sociology''], Routledge, 1989: "Historicism", p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Historism'' is not to be confused with ''[[historicism]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Historicism in the sense given to it by Karl Popper, namely the search for historical laws.&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless the English habits of using both words are very similar. (The term ''historism'' is sometimes reserved to identify the specific current called ''Historismus'' in the tradition of German philosophy and historiography.)&lt;ref name="CrDSoc"/&gt;

==Criticism==
Because of the power held on the [[social sciences]] by [[logical positivism]], historism or historicism is deemed unpopular.&lt;ref&gt;Morera, Esteve (1990), ''Gramsci's Historicism: A Realist Interpretation'', Routledge, [https://books.google.com/books?id=I44OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA11 p. 11].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Popper]], one of the most distinguished critics of historicism, criticized historism, too. He differentiated between both phenomena as follows: The term ''historicism'' is used in his influential books ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' and ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' to describe “an approach to the social sciences which assumes that ''historical prediction'' is their primary aim, and which assumes that this aim is attainable by discovering the 'rhythms' or the 'patterns', the 'laws' or the 'trends' that underlie the evolution of history”.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper, ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'', Routledge, 1993, p. 3 (italics in original).&lt;/ref&gt; Popper wrote with reference to [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s theory of [[history]], which he criticized extensively. By ''historism'' on the contrary, he means the tendency to regard every argument or idea as completely accounted for by its historical context, as opposed to assessing it by its merits. ''Historism'' does not aim for the 'laws' of history, but premises the individuality of each historical situation.

On the basis of Popper's definitions, the historian [[Stefan Berger]] proposes as a proper word usage: {{"|I deliberately use the term ‘historism’ (and ‘historist’) rather than ‘historicism’ (and ‘historicist’). Whereas ‘historism’ (in German, ''Historismus''), as represented by [[Leopold von Ranke]], can be seen as an evolutionary, reformist concept which understands all political order as historically developed and grown, ‘historicism’ (''Historizismus''), as defined and rejected by Karl Popper, is based on the notion that history develops according to predetermined laws towards a particular end. The English language, by using only one term for those different concepts, tends to conflate the two. Hence I suggest using two separate terms in analogy to the German language.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Berger, "[http://www.perspectivia.net/content/publikationen/ghi-bulletin/2001-23-1/0021-0033/at_download/document Stefan Berger responds to Ulrich Muhlack]". In: Bulletin of the German Historical Institute London, Volume XXIII, No. 1, May 2001, pp. 21–33, here p. 28f. (italics in original).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Notable exponents==
Notable exponents of historism were primarily the German 19th-century historians [[Leopold von Ranke]]&lt;ref&gt;Beiser 2011, p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Johann Gustav Droysen]],&lt;ref&gt;Colin Cheyne, [[John Worrall (philosopher)|John Worrall]] (eds.), ''Rationality and Reality: Conversations with Alan Musgrave'', Springer 2006, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; 20th-century historian [[Friedrich Meinecke]],&lt;ref&gt;Beiser 2014, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; and the philosopher [[Wilhelm Dilthey]].&lt;ref&gt;Koslowski 2006, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Dilthey was influenced by Ranke.&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p27"/&gt; The jurists [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]] and [[Karl Friedrich Eichhorn]] were strongly influenced by the ideas of historism and founded the [[German Historical School|German Historical School of Law]]. The Italian philosopher and historian [[Benedetto Croce]]&lt;ref&gt;Robin Headlam Wells, Glenn Burgess, Rowland Wymer (eds.), ''Neo-historicism: Studies in Renaissance Literature, History, and Politics'', Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd, 2000, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and his British colleague [[R. G. Collingwood|Robin George Collingwood]]&lt;ref name="vdD"&gt;Collingwood himself used the term "historicism"—a term he apparently coined—to describe his approach—for example in his 'Ruskin's Philosophy', lecture delivered to the Ruskin Centenary Conference Exhibition, [[Coniston, Cumbria]] (see Jan van der Dussen, ''History as a Science: The Philosophy of R.G. Collingwood'', Springer, 2012, p. 49)—, but some later historiographers describe him as a proponent of "historism," in accordance with the current meaning of the term in English (see F. R. Ankersmit, ''Sublime Historical Experience'', Stanford University Press, 2005, p. 404).&lt;/ref&gt; were important European exponents of historism in the late 19th and early 20th century. Collingwood was influenced by Dilthey.&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p27"&gt;Wallace and Gach 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=64Y6wtqzs7IC&amp;pg=PA27 p. 27].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Naugle, [http://www3.dbu.edu/naugle/pdf/collingwood.pdf "R. G. Collingwood and the Hermeneutic Tradition"], 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ranke's arguments can be viewed as an antidote to the lawlike and [[quantitative research|quantitative]] approaches common in [[sociology]] and most other [[social sciences]].&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p14"&gt;Wallace and Gach 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=64Y6wtqzs7IC&amp;pg=PA14 p. 14].&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle of historism has a universal methodological significance in [[Marxism]].&lt;ref name="Spirkin"&gt;{{citation |year= 1990  |author= Alexander Spirkin  |authorlink= Alexander Spirkin  |author2= Sergei Syrovatkin (translator) |title= Fundamentals of Philosophy.  |place= [[Moscow]]  |publisher= [[Progress Publishers]]  |isbn= 978-5-01-002582-3 |url= https://archive.org/details/FundamentalsOfPhilosophy_913 |accessdate= 15 January 2011 |postscript=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;First published in 1988, as “Основы философии” }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|127}} The essence of this principle, in brief, is

Lenin, ''Collected Works'', Vol. 29, [[Progress Publishers]], Moscow, 1972, p. 473.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Georg G. Iggers]] is one of the most important critical authors on historism. His book ''The German Conception of History: The National Tradition of Historical Thought from Herder to the Present'', first published in 1968 (by Wesleyan University Press, Middletown, Ct.) is a "classic”&lt;ref&gt;Berger 2001, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; among critiques of historism.

Another critique is presented by the German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], whose essay ''Vom Nutzen und Nachteil der Historie für das Leben'' (''On the Use and Abuse of History for Life'', 1874; see ''[[The Untimely Meditations]]'') denounces “a malignant historical fever”. Nietzsche contends that the historians of his times, the historists, damaged the powers of human life by relegating it to the past instead of opening it to the future. For this reason, he calls for a return, beyond historism, to humanism.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche: ''[[s:On the Use and Abuse of History for Life|On the Use and Abuse of History for Life]]'', first published 1874, translated 1909.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporaries==
20th-century German historians promoting some aspects of historism are [[Ulrich Muhlack]], [[Thomas Nipperdey]] and [[Jörn Rüsen]].

Also the Spanish philosopher [[José Ortega y Gasset]] was influenced by historism.

The '''Industrial Revolution''' was the transition to new manufacturing processes in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. This transition included going from [[craft production|hand production methods]] to [[machine]]s, new [[chemical manufacturing]] and [[Puddling (metallurgy)|iron production]] processes, the increasing use of [[steam power]], the development of [[machine tool]]s and the rise of the [[factory system]].

[[Textile]]s were the dominant industry of the Industrial Revolution in terms of employment, value of output and [[capital (economics)|capital]] invested. The [[textile industry]] was also the first to use modern production methods.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"&gt;{{cite book|author= David S.

An entrepreneurial spirit and consumer revolution helped drive [[industrialisation]] in Britain which after 1800 was emulated in Belgium, the United States, and France.&lt;ref name="Kiely"/&gt;  --&gt;

The Industrial Revolution marks a major turning point in history; almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way. In particular, average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth.  Some economists say that the major impact of the Industrial Revolution was that the [[standard of living]] for the general population began to increase consistently for the first time in history, although others have said that it did not begin to meaningfully improve until the late 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref name="Lectures on Economic Growth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Feinstein2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SzreterMooney2014"/&gt;

Although the [[structural change]] from agriculture to industry is widely associated with Industrial Revolution, in United Kingdom it was already almost complete by 1760.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |type=PhD |last=Keibek |first=Sebastiaan A.J. |date=2016 |title=The male occupational structure of England and Wales, 1600-1850 |publisher=University of Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The precise start and end of the Industrial Revolution is still debated among historians, as is the pace of economic and [[social change]]s.&lt;ref name="revolution"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rehabilitating the Industrial Revolution"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lorenzen"/&gt; [[Eric Hobsbawm]] held that the Industrial Revolution began in Britain in the 1780s and was not fully felt until the 1830s or 1840s,&lt;ref name="revolution"/&gt; while [[T.

[[Textile industry|Mechanized textile production]] spread from Great Britain to continental Europe and the United States in the early 19th century, with important centres of textiles, iron and coal emerging [[#Belgium|in Belgium]] and the United States and later textiles in France.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;

An economic recession occurred from the late 1830s to the early 1840s when the adoption of the original innovations of the Industrial Revolution, such as mechanized spinning and weaving, slowed and their markets matured. Innovations developed late in the period, such as the increasing adoption of locomotives, steamboats and steamships, [[Hot blast|hot blast iron smelting]] and new technologies, such as the [[electrical telegraph]], widely introduced in the 1840s and 1850s, were not powerful enough to drive high rates of growth.  Rapid economic growth began to occur after 1870, springing from a new group of innovations in what has been called the [[Second Industrial Revolution]].  These new innovations included new steel making processes, the large-scale manufacture of machine tools and the use of increasingly advanced machinery in steam-powered factories.&lt;ref  name="David S.

==Etymology==
The earliest recorded use of the term "Industrial Revolution" seems to have been in a letter from 6 July 1799 written by French envoy [[Louis-Guillaume Otto]], announcing that France had entered the race to industrialise.&lt;ref name="The industrial revolution in national context: Europe and the USA"/&gt; In his 1976 book ''[[Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society]]'', [[Raymond Williams]] states in the entry for "Industry": "The idea of a new social order based on major industrial change was clear in [[Robert Southey|Southey]] and [[Robert Owen|Owen]], between 1811 and 1818, and was implicit as early as [[William Blake|Blake]] in the early 1790s and [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] at the turn of the [19th] century." The term ''Industrial Revolution'' applied to technological change was becoming more common by the late 1830s, as in [[Jérôme-Adolphe Blanqui]]'s description in 1837 of ''la révolution industrielle''.&lt;ref&gt;BLANQUI Jérôme-Adolphe, ''Histoire de l'économie politique en Europe depuis les anciens jusqu'à nos jours'', 1837, {{ISBN|978-0-543-94762-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Engels]] in ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England]]'' in 1844 spoke of "an industrial revolution, a revolution which at the same time changed the whole of civil society".  However, although Engels wrote in the 1840s, his book was not translated into English until the late 1800s, and his expression did not enter everyday language until then. Credit for popularising the term may be given to [[Arnold Toynbee]], whose 1881 lectures gave a detailed account of the term.&lt;ref name="The Industrial Revolution13"/&gt;

Some historians, such as [[John Clapham (economic historian)|John Clapham]] and [[Nicholas Crafts]], have argued that the economic and social changes occurred gradually and the term ''revolution'' is a misnomer. This is still a subject of debate among some historians.

==Important technological developments==
The commencement of the Industrial Revolution is closely linked to a small number of innovations,&lt;ref name="The Industrial Revolution – Innovations"/&gt; beginning in the second half of the 18th century.  By the 1830s the following gains had been made in important technologies:
* '''Textiles''' – mechanised cotton spinning powered by steam or water increased the output of a worker by a factor of around 500. The [[power loom]] increased the output of a worker by a factor of over 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ayres|1989|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[cotton gin]] increased productivity of removing seed from cotton by a factor of 50.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;  Large gains in productivity also occurred in spinning and weaving of wool and linen, but they were not as great as in cotton.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;&lt;!--[[File:Watt James von Breda.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[James Watt]] improved on [[Thomas Newcomen|Newcomen]]'s 1712 steam engine with his [[Watt steam engine]] in 1781]]--&gt;
* '''Steam power''' – the efficiency of [[steam engine]]s increased so that they used between one-fifth and one-tenth as much fuel.  The adaptation of stationary steam engines to rotary motion made them suitable for industrial uses.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;{{rp|82}}  The high pressure engine had a high power to weight ratio, making it suitable for transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter|year-1985|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Steam power underwent a rapid expansion after 1800.
* '''Iron making''' – the substitution of [[coke (fuel)|coke]] for charcoal greatly lowered the fuel cost of [[pig iron]] and [[wrought iron]] production.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;{{rp|89–93}}  Using coke also allowed larger blast furnaces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= David S. Landes|date=1969|title= The Unbound Prometheus|publisher= Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|isbn= 978-0-521-09418-4|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Most Powerful Idea in the World: A Story of Steam, Industry and Invention|last1= Rosen|first1= William|year= 2012 |publisher = University Of Chicago Pres|isbn= 978-0-226-72634-2 |page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in [[economies of scale]].  The steam engine began being used to pump water to power blast air in the mid 1750s, enabling a large increase in iron production by overcoming the limitation of water power.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;  The cast iron blowing cylinder was first used in 1760.  It was later improved by making it double acting, which allowed higher [[blast furnace]] temperatures.  The [[puddling (metallurgy)|puddling process]] produced a structural grade iron at a lower cost than the [[finery forge]].&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969 91"&gt;{{cite book|author= David S. Landes|date=1969|title= The Unbound Prometheus|publisher= Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|isbn= 978-0-521-09418-4|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Rolling (metalworking)|rolling mill]] was fifteen times faster than hammering wrought iron. [[Hot blast]] (1828) greatly increased fuel efficiency in iron production in the following decades.
* '''Invention of machine tools''' – The first [[machine tools]] were invented.  These included the [[screw cutting lathe]], cylinder boring machine and the [[Milling (machining)|milling machine]].   Machine tools made the economical manufacture of [[Interchangeable parts|precision metal parts]] possible, although it took several decades to develop effective techniques.&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984"/&gt;

===Textile manufacture===
{{Main|Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution}}

====British textile industry statistics====
In 1750 Britain imported 2.5 million pounds of raw cotton, most of which was spun and woven by cottage industry in Lancashire. The work was done by hand in workers' homes or occasionally in shops of master weavers. In 1787 raw cotton consumption was 22 million pounds, most of which was cleaned, carded and spun on machines.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;{{rp|41–42}} The British textile industry used 52 million pounds of cotton in 1800, which increased to 588 million pounds in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Industrialization and Society|last=Hopkins|first=Eric|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|location=London|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The share of value added by the cotton textile industry in Britain was 2.6% in 1760, 17% in 1801 and 22.4% in 1831.  Value added by the British woollen industry was 14.1% in 1801.  Cotton factories in Britain numbered approximately 900 in 1797.  In 1760 approximately one-third of cotton cloth manufactured in Britain was exported, rising to two-thirds by 1800.  In 1781 cotton spun amounted to 5.1 million pounds, which increased to 56 million pounds by 1800.  In 1800 less than 0.1% of world cotton cloth was produced on machinery invented in Britain.  In 1788 there were 50,000 spindles in Britain, rising to 7 million over the next 30 years.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;

Wages in [[Lancashire]], a core region for cottage industry and later factory spinning and weaving, were about six times those in India in 1770, when overall [[productivity]] in Britain was about three times higher than in India.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;

====Cotton====
Parts of India, China, Central America, South America and the Middle-East have a long history of hand manufacturing [[cotton]] textiles, which became a major industry sometime after 1000 AD. In tropical and subtropical regions where it was grown, most was grown by small farmers alongside their food crops and was spun and woven in households, largely for domestic consumption.  In the 15th century China began to require households to pay part of their taxes in cotton cloth. By the 17th century almost all Chinese wore cotton clothing.  Almost everywhere cotton cloth could be used as a [[medium of exchange]].  In India a significant amount of cotton textiles were manufactured for distant markets, often produced by professional weavers.  Some merchants also owned small weaving workshops. India produced a variety of cotton cloth, some of exceptionally fine quality.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"&gt;{{cite book|title= Empire of Cotton: A Global History|last=Beckert|first= Sven|year= 2014|publisher =Vintage Books Division Penguin Random House |location=US|isbn= 978-0-375-71396-5|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cotton was a difficult raw material for Europe to obtain before it was grown on colonial plantations in the Americas.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;  The early Spanish explorers found Native Americans growing unknown species of excellent quality cotton: sea island cotton (''[[Gossypium barbadense]]'') and upland green seeded cotton ''[[Gossypium hirsutum]]''.  Sea island cotton grew in tropical areas and on barrier islands of Georgia and South Carolina, but did poorly inland.  Sea island cotton began being exported from Barbados in the 1650s. Upland green seeded cotton grew well on inland areas of the southern U.S., but was not economical because of the difficulty of removing seed, a problem solved by the [[cotton gin]].&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;{{rp|157}} A strain of cotton seed brought from Mexico to Natchez, Mississippi, USA in 1806 became the parent genetic material for over 90% of world cotton production today; it produced [[Cotton Boll|boll]]s that were three to four times faster to pick.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;

====Trade and textiles====
[[File:Colonisation 1754.png|thumb|upright=1.25|European colonial empires at the start of the Industrial Revolution, imposed upon modern political boundaries.]]

The [[Age of Discovery]] was followed by a period of [[colonialism]] beginning around the 16th century. Following the discovery of a trade route to India around southern Africa by the Portuguese, the Dutch established the Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie (abbr. VOC) or [[Dutch East India Company]] and the British founded the [[East India Company]], along with smaller companies of different nationalities which established trading posts and employed agents to engage in trade throughout the Indian Ocean region and between the Indian Ocean region and North Atlantic Europe.  One of the largest segments of this trade was in cotton textiles, which were purchased in India and sold in Southeast Asia, including the Indonesian archipelago, where spices were purchased for sale to Southeast Asia and Europe.  By the mid-1760s cloth was over three-quarters of the East India Company's exports.  Indian textiles were in demand in North Atlantic region of Europe where previously only wool and linen were available; however, the amount of cotton goods consumed in Western Europe was minor until the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;

====Pre-mechanized European textile production====
By 1600 Flemish refugees began weaving cotton cloth in English towns where cottage spinning and weaving of wool and linen was well established; however, they were left alone by the [[guild]]s who did not consider cotton a threat.  Earlier European attempts at cotton spinning and weaving were in 12th century Italy and 15th century southern Germany, but these industries eventually ended when the supply of cotton was cut off.  The [[Moors]] in Spain grew, spun and wove cotton beginning around the 10th century.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014" /&gt;

The demand for heavier fabric was met by a domestic industry based around [[Lancashire]] that produced [[fustian]], a cloth with flax [[warp (weaving)|warp]] and cotton [[weft]].  Flax was used for the warp because wheel-spun cotton did not have sufficient strength, but the resulting blend was not as soft as 100% cotton and was more difficult to sew.&lt;ref name="Ayers1989"&gt;{{Cite journal

On the eve of the Industrial Revolution, spinning and weaving were done in households, for domestic consumption and as a cottage industry under the [[putting-out system]].  Occasionally the work was done in the workshop of a master weaver. Under the putting-out system, home-based workers produced under contract to merchant sellers, who often supplied the raw materials.  In the off season the women, typically farmers' wives, did the spinning and the men did the weaving.  Using the [[spinning wheel]], it took anywhere from four to eight spinners to supply one hand loom weaver.&lt;ref name="David S.

====Invention of textile machinery====
The [[flying shuttle]], patented in 1733 by [[John Kay (flying shuttle)|John Kay]], with a number of subsequent improvements including an important one in 1747, doubled the output of a weaver, worsening the imbalance between spinning and weaving.  It became widely used around Lancashire after 1760 when John's son, [[Robert Kay (inventor)|Robert]], invented the drop box, which facilitated changing thread colors.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;{{rp|821–22}}

[[Lewis Paul]] patented the roller [[spinning frame]] and the flyer-and-bobbin system for drawing wool to a more even thickness. The technology was developed with the help of John Wyatt of [[Birmingham]].  Paul and Wyatt opened a mill in Birmingham which used their new rolling machine powered by a donkey. In 1743 a factory opened in [[Northampton]] with 50 spindles on each of five of Paul and Wyatt's machines. This operated until about 1764. A similar mill was built by [[Daniel Bourn]] in [[Leominster]], but this burnt down. Both Lewis Paul and Daniel Bourn patented [[carding]] machines in 1748. Based on two sets of rollers that travelled at different speeds, it was later used in the first [[cotton mill|cotton spinning mill]]. Lewis's invention was later developed and improved by [[Richard Arkwright]] in his [[water frame]] and [[Samuel Crompton]] in his [[spinning mule]].
[[File:Spinning jenny.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.05|Model of the [[spinning jenny]] in a museum in [[Wuppertal]]. Invented by [[James Hargreaves]] in 1764,  the spinning jenny was one of the innovations that started the revolution.]]
In 1764 in the village of Stanhill, Lancashire, [[James Hargreaves]] invented the [[spinning jenny]], which he patented in 1770. It was the first practical spinning frame with multiple spindles.&lt;ref&gt;R. Ray Gehani (1998). "Management of Technology and Operations". p. 63. John Wiley and Sons, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  The jenny worked in a similar manner to the spinning wheel, by first clamping down on the fibres, then by drawing them out, followed by twisting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ayres|1989|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a simple, wooden framed machine that only cost about £6 for a 40-spindle model in 1792,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= David S. Landes|date=1969|title= The Unbound Prometheus|publisher= Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|isbn= 978-0-521-09418-4|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was used mainly by home spinners. The jenny produced a lightly twisted yarn only suitable for [[weft]], not [[warp (weaving)|warp]].&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;{{rp|825–27}}

The [[spinning frame]] or water frame was developed by Richard Arkwright who, along with two partners, patented it in 1769. The design was partly based on a spinning machine built for Thomas High by clockmaker John Kay, who was hired by Arkwright.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;{{rp|827–30}}  For each spindle the water frame used a series of four pairs of rollers, each operating at a successively higher rotating speed, to draw out the fibre, which was then twisted by the spindle.  The roller spacing was slightly longer than the fibre length.  Too close a spacing caused the fibres to break while too distant a spacing caused uneven thread.  The top rollers were leather-covered and loading on the rollers was applied by a weight.  The weights kept the twist from backing up before the rollers. The bottom rollers were wood and metal, with fluting along the length.  The water frame was able to produce a hard, medium count thread suitable for warp, finally allowing 100% cotton cloth to be made in Britain.  A horse powered the first factory to use the spinning frame. Arkwright and his partners used water power at a factory in Cromford, Derbyshire in 1771, giving the invention its name.

[[File:Mule-jenny.jpg|thumb|The only surviving example of a [[spinning mule]] built by the inventor [[Samuel Crompton]].  The mule produced high-quality thread with minimal labour.]]

[[Samuel Crompton]]'s [[spinning mule|Spinning Mule]] was introduced in 1779.  Mule implies a hybrid because it was a combination of the spinning jenny and the water frame, in which the spindles were placed on a carriage, which went through an operational sequence during which the rollers stopped while the carriage moved away from the drawing roller to finish drawing out the fibres as the spindles started rotating.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;{{rp|832}}  Crompton's mule was able to produce finer thread than hand spinning and at a lower cost.  Mule spun thread was of suitable strength to be used as warp, and finally allowed Britain to produce highly competitive yarn in large quantities.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;{{rp|832}}

[[File:Marshall's flax-mill, Holbeck, Leeds - interior - c.1800.jpg|thumb|Interior of Marshall's [[Temple Works]]]]

Realising that the expiration of the Arkwright patent would greatly increase the supply of spun cotton and lead to a shortage of weavers, Edmund Cartwright developed a vertical [[power loom]] which he patented in 1785.  In 1776 he patented a two-man operated loom which was more conventional.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;{{rp|834}}  Cartwright built two factories; the first burned down and the second was sabotaged by his workers. Cartwright's loom design had several flaws, the most serious being thread breakage. Samuel Horrocks patented a fairly successful loom in 1813.  Horock's loom was improved by Richard Roberts in 1822 and these were produced in large numbers by Roberts, Hill &amp; Co.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ayres|1989|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The demand for cotton presented an opportunity to planters in the Southern United States, who thought upland cotton would be a profitable crop if a better way could be found to remove the seed. [[Eli Whitney]] responded to the challenge by inventing the inexpensive [[cotton gin]].  A man using a cotton gin could remove seed from as much upland cotton in one day as would previously, working at the rate of one pound of cotton per day, have taken a woman two months to process.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"&gt;{{citation | last = Roe | first = Joseph Wickham | title = English and American Tool Builders | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1916 | location = New Haven, Connecticut | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage | lccn = 16011753}}.

These advances were capitalised on by [[entrepreneur]]s, of whom the best known is Richard Arkwright. He is credited with a list of inventions, but these were actually developed by such people as [[Thomas Highs]] and [[John Kay (spinning frame)|John Kay]]; Arkwright nurtured the inventors, patented the ideas, financed the initiatives, and protected the machines. He created the [[cotton mill]] which brought the production processes together in a factory, and he developed the use of power – first horse power and then [[Hydropower|water power]]{{mdash}}which made cotton manufacture a mechanised industry. Other inventors increased the efficiency of the individual steps of spinning (carding, twisting and spinning, and rolling) so that the supply of [[yarn]] increased greatly. Before long [[Watt steam engine|steam power]] was applied to drive textile machinery. [[Manchester]] acquired the nickname [[Cottonopolis]] during the early 19th century owing to its sprawl of textile factories.&lt;ref&gt;G. E. Mingay (1986). "The Transformation of Britain, 1830–1939". p. 25. Routledge, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

Although mechanization dramatically decreased the cost of cotton cloth, by the mid-19th century machine-woven cloth still could not equal the quality of hand-woven Indian cloth, in part due to the fineness of thread made possible by the type of cotton used in India, which allowed high thread counts.  However, the high productivity of British textile manufacturing allowed coarser grades of British cloth to undersell hand-spun and woven fabric in low-wage India, eventually destroying the industry.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;

====Wool====
The earliest European attempts at mechanized spinning were with wool; however, wool spinning proved more difficult to mechanize than cotton.  Productivity improvement in wool spinning during the Industrial Revolution was significant but was far less than that of cotton.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name=David_Landes_1999/&gt;

====Silk====
[[File:Silkmill1.jpg|thumb|Lombe's Mill site today, rebuilt as [[Derby Silk Mill]]]]
Arguably the first highly mechanised factory was [[John Lombe]]'s [[Derby Industrial Museum|water-powered silk mill]] at [[Derby]], operational by 1721. Lombe learned silk thread manufacturing by taking a job in Italy and acting as an industrial spy; however, because the Italian silk industry guarded its secrets closely, the state of the industry at that time is unknown. Although Lombe's factory was technically successful, the supply of raw silk from Italy was cut off to eliminate competition.  In order to promote manufacturing the Crown paid for models of Lombe's machinery which were exhibited in the [[Tower of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=75296|first=Richard L.|last=Hills|title=Cotchett, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=47971|first=K.

===Iron industry===
[[File:Reverberatory furnace diagram.png|thumb|right|The [[reverberatory furnace]] could produce [[cast iron]] using mined coal. The burning coal remained separate from the iron and so did not contaminate the iron with impurities like sulphur and silica. This opened the way to increased iron production.]]

====UK iron production statistics====
Bar iron was the commodity form of iron used as the raw material for making hardware goods such as nails, wire, hinges, horse shoes, wagon tires, chains, etc. and for structural shapes. A small amount of bar iron was converted into steel.  [[Cast iron]] was used for pots, stoves and other items where its brittleness was tolerable.  Most cast iron was refined and converted to bar iron, with substantial losses.  Bar iron was also made by the [[bloomery]] process, which was the predominant iron smelting process until the late 18th century.

In  the UK in 1720 there were 20,500 tons of cast iron produced with charcoal and 400 tons with coke. In 1750 charcoal iron production was 24,500 and coke iron was 2,500 tons.  In 1788 the production of charcoal cast iron was 14,000 tons while coke iron production was 54,000 tons.  In 1806 charcoal cast iron production was 7,800 tons and coke cast iron was 250,000 tons.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;{{rp|125}}

In 1750 the UK imported 31,200 tons of bar iron and either refined from cast iron or directly produced 18,800 tons of bar iron using charcoal and 100 tons using  coke.  In 1796 the UK was making 125,000 tons of bar iron with coke and 6,400 tons with charcoal; imports were 38,000 tons and exports were 24,600 tons. In 1806 the UK did not import bar iron but exported 31,500 tons.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;{{rp|125}}

====Iron process innovations====
A major change in the iron industries during the era of the Industrial Revolution was the replacement of [[wood]] and other bio-fuels with coal. For a given amount of heat, coal required much less labour to mine than cutting wood and converting it to charcoal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title= American Iron 1607–1900|last=Gordon|first= Robert B|year=1996 |publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore and London|isbn= 978-0-8018-6816-0 |page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; and coal was much more abundant than wood, supplies of which were becoming scarce before the enormous increase in iron production that took place in the late 18th century.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Metallurgy, Second Edition |last=Tylecote |first=R. F.|year= 1992|publisher =Maney Publishing, for the Institute of Materials |location= London|isbn=978-0901462886}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|122}}  By 1750 [[coke (fuel)|coke]] had generally replaced charcoal in smelting of copper and lead and was in widespread use in making glass.  In the smelting and refining of iron, coal and [[coke (fuel)|coke]] produced inferior iron to that made with charcoal because of the coal's sulfur content.  Low sulfur coals were known, but they still contained harmful amounts.  Conversion of coal to coke only slightly reduces the sulfur content.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;{{rp|122–125}} A minority of coals are coking.

Another factor limiting the iron industry before the Industrial Revolution was the scarcity of water power to power blast bellows.  This limitation was overcome by the steam engine.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;

Use of coal in iron [[smelting]] started somewhat before the Industrial Revolution, based on innovations by Sir [[Clement Clerke]] and others from 1678, using coal [[reverberatory furnace]]s known as cupolas. These were operated by the flames playing on the [[ore]] and charcoal or [[coke (fuel)|coke]] mixture, [[Redox|reducing]] the [[oxide]] to metal. This has the advantage that impurities (such as sulphur ash) in the coal do not migrate into the metal. This technology was applied to [[lead]] from 1678 and to [[copper]] from 1687. It was also applied to iron foundry work in the 1690s, but in this case the reverberatory furnace was known as an air furnace. (The [[Cupola furnace|foundry cupola]] is a different, and later, innovation.)

By 1709 [[Abraham Darby I|Abraham Darby]] made progress using coke to fuel his [[blast furnace]]s at [[Coalbrookdale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Danny Boyle's intro on Olympics programme |url=http://www.awardsdaily.com/blog/2012/07/27/danny-boyles-intro-on-olympics-programme/ |publisher=Awards Daily |first=Ryan|last=Adams|date=July 27, 2012 |accessdate=December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the coke [[pig iron]] he made was not suitable for making wrought iron and was used mostly for the production of [[cast iron]] goods, such as pots and kettles. He had the advantage over his rivals in that his pots, cast by his patented process, were thinner and cheaper than theirs.

Coke pig iron was hardly used to produce [[wrought iron]] until 1755-56, when Darby's son [[Abraham Darby II]] built furnaces at [[Horsehay]] and [[Ketley]] where low sulfur coal was available (and not far from Coalbrookdale).  These new furnaces were equipped with water-powered bellows, the water being pumped by [[Newcomen atmospheric engine|Newcomen steam engines]].  The Newcomen engines were not attached directly to the blowing cylinders because the engines alone could not produce a steady air blast.  Abraham Darby III installed similar steam-pumped, water-powered blowing cylinders at the Dale Company when he took control in 1768.  The Dale Company used several Newcomen engines to drain its mines and made parts for engines which it sold throughout the country.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;{{rp|123–125}}

Steam engines made the use of higher-pressure and volume blast practical; however, the leather used in bellows was expensive to replace. In 1757, iron master [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]] patented a hydraulic powered [[blowing engine]] for blast furnaces.&lt;ref&gt;

[[James Watt]] had great difficulty trying to have a cylinder made for his first steam engine.  In 1774 John Wilkinson, who built a cast iron blowing cylinder for his iron works, invented a precision boring machine for boring cylinders. After Wilkinson bored the first successful cylinder for a [[Boulton and Watt]] steam engine in 1776, he was given an exclusive contract for providing cylinders.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Author Simon Winchester dates the start of the Industrial Revolution to 4th May, 1776, the day that John Wilkinson presented James Watt with his precision-made cylinder. (August 19, 2018 - 10:00 ET)[http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1808/19/fzgps.01.html Fareed Zakaria - GPS]. CNN.com&lt;/ref&gt;  After Watt developed a rotary steam engine in 1782, they were widely applied to blowing, hammering, rolling and slitting.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;{{rp|124}}

The solutions to the sulfur problem were the addition of sufficient limestone to the furnace to force sulfur into the slag and the use of low sulfur coal.  Use of lime or limestone required higher furnace temperatures to form a free-flowing slag. The increased furnace temperature made possible by improved blowing also increased the capacity of blast furnaces and allowed for increased furnace height.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;{{rp|123–125}}  In addition to lower cost and greater availability, coke had other important advantages over charcoal in that it was harder and made the column of materials (iron ore, fuel, slag) flowing down the blast furnace more porous and did not crush in the much taller furnaces of the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Inside the Black Box: Technology and Economics|last= Rosenberg|first= Nathan |authorlink= |year=1982 |publisher =Cambridge University Press|location= Cambridge, New York |isbn=978-0-521-27367-1 |page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Unbound Prometheus: Technological Change and Industrial Development in Western Europe from 1750 to the Present |last=Landes |first= David.

As cast iron became cheaper and widely available, it began being a structural material for bridges and buildings.  A famous early example was the [[The Iron Bridge|Iron Bridge]] built in 1778 with cast iron produced by [[Abraham Darby III]].&lt;ref name="Iron bridge"/&gt;  However, most cast iron was converted to [[wrought iron]].

Europe relied on the [[bloomery]] for most of its wrought iron until the large scale production of cast iron.  Conversion of cast iron was done in a [[finery forge]], as it long had been.  An improved refining process known as [[potting and stamping]] was developed, but this was superseded by [[Henry Cort]]'s [[Puddling furnace|puddling]] process. Cort developed two significant iron manufacturing processes: [[Rolling (metalworking)|rolling]] in 1783 and [[puddling (metallurgy)|puddling]] in 1784.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;{{rp|91}}  Puddling produced a structural grade iron at a relatively low cost.

[[Puddling (metallurgy)|Puddling]] was a means of decarburizing molten pig iron by slow oxidation in a reverberatory furnace by manually stirring it with a long rod.  The decarburized iron, having a higher melting point than cast iron, was raked into globs by the puddler.  When the glob was large enough, the puddler would remove it.  Puddling was backbreaking and extremely hot work.  Few puddlers lived to be 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because puddling was done in a reverberatory furnace, coal or coke could be used as fuel.  The puddling process continued to be used until the late 19th century when iron was being displaced by steel.  Because puddling required human skill in sensing the iron globs, it was never successfully mechanised. Rolling was an important part of the puddling process because the grooved rollers expelled most of the molten slag and consolidated the mass of hot wrought iron. Rolling was 15 times faster at this than a [[trip hammer]].  A different use of rolling, which was done at lower temperatures than that for expelling slag, was in the production of iron sheets, and later structural shapes such as beams, angles and rails.
 
The puddling process was improved in 1818 by Baldwyn Rogers, who replaced some of the sand lining on the reverberatory furnace bottom with iron oxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Journal of the Iron and Steel Institute|url={{Google books|_tijGo0WWHMC|page=PA20|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|year=1879|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1838 [[Joseph Hall (metallurgist)|John Hall]] patented the use of roasted tap cinder (iron silicate) for the furnace bottom, greatly reducing the loss of iron through increased slag caused by a sand lined bottom. The tap cinder also tied up some phosphorus, but this was not understood at the time.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;{{rp|166}}  Hall's process also used iron scale or rust, which reacted with carbon in the molten iron. Hall's process, called ''wet puddling'', reduced losses of iron with the slag from almost 50% to around 8%.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;{{rp|93}}

Puddling became widely used after 1800. Up to that time British iron manufacturers had used considerable amounts of iron imported from Sweden and Russia to supplement domestic supplies.  Because of the increased British production, imports began to decline in 1785 and by the 1790s Britain eliminated imports and became a net exporter of bar iron.

[[Hot blast]], patented by [[James Beaumont Neilson]] in 1828, was the most important development of the 19th century for saving energy in making pig iron.  By using preheated combustion air, the amount of fuel to make a unit of pig iron was reduced at first by between one-third using coke or two-thirds using coal;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= David S. Landes|date=1969|title= The Unbound Prometheus|publisher= Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|isbn= 978-0-521-09418-4|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the efficiency gains continued as the technology improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ayres|1989|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hot blast also raised the operating temperature of furnaces, increasing their capacity.  Using less coal or coke meant introducing fewer impurities into the pig iron.  This meant that lower quality coal or [[anthracite]] could be used in areas where coking coal was unavailable or too expensive;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Inside the Black Box: Technology and Economics

Shortly before the Industrial Revolution an improvement was made in the production of [[steel]], which was an expensive commodity and used only where iron would not do, such as for cutting edge tools and for springs. [[Benjamin Huntsman]] developed his [[crucible steel]] technique in the 1740s. The raw material for this was blister steel, made by the [[cementation process]].

The supply of cheaper iron and steel aided a number of industries, such as those making nails, hinges, wire and other hardware items. The development of [[machine tool]]s allowed better working of iron, causing it to be increasingly used in the rapidly growing machinery and engine industries.

===Steam power===
{{Main|Steam power during the Industrial Revolution}}
[[File:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|A [[Watt steam engine]]. [[James Watt]] transformed the [[steam engine]] from a  [[reciprocating motion]] that was used for pumping to a [[Rotation|rotating motion]] suited to industrial applications.  Watt and others significantly improved the efficiency of the steam engine.]]

The development of the [[stationary steam engine]] was an important element of the Industrial Revolution; however, during the early period of the Industrial Revolution, most industrial power was supplied by water and wind.  In Britain by 1800 an estimated 10,000 horsepower was being supplied by steam.  By 1815 steam power had grown to 210,000&amp;nbsp;hp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= David S. Landes|date=1969|title= The Unbound Prometheus|publisher= Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|isbn= 978-0-521-09418-4|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first commercially successful industrial use of steam power was due to [[Thomas Savery]] in 1698. He constructed and patented in London a low-lift combined vacuum and pressure water pump, that generated about one [[horsepower]] (hp) and was used in numerous water works and in a few mines (hence its "brand name", ''The Miner's Friend''). Savery's pump was economical in small horsepower ranges, but was prone to boiler explosions in larger sizes.  Savery pumps continued to be produced until the late 18th century.

The first successful piston steam engine was introduced by [[Thomas Newcomen]] before 1712. A number of Newcomen engines were installed in Britain for draining hitherto unworkable deep mines, with the engine on the surface; these were large machines, requiring a significant amount of capital to build, and produced upwards of {{convert|5|hp|abbr=on}}. They were also used to power municipal water supply pumps.  They were extremely inefficient by modern standards, but when located where coal was cheap at pit heads, opened up a great expansion in coal mining by allowing mines to go deeper. Despite their disadvantages, Newcomen engines were reliable and easy to maintain and continued to be used in the coalfields until the early decades of the 19th century. By 1729, when Newcomen died, his engines had spread (first) to Hungary in 1722, Germany, Austria, and Sweden. A total of 110 are known to have been built by 1733 when the joint patent expired, of which 14 were abroad. In the 1770s the engineer [[John Smeaton]] built some very large examples and introduced a number of improvements. A total of 1,454 engines had been built by 1800.&lt;ref name="allen"/&gt;

[[File:Newcomens Dampfmaschine aus Meyers 1890.png|thumb|upright|left|[[Newcomen steam engine|Newcomen's steam-powered atmospheric engine]] was the first practical piston steam engine. Subsequent steam engines were to power the Industrial Revolution.]]

A fundamental change in working principles was brought about by [[Scottish people|Scotsman]] [[James Watt]]. With financial support from his business partner [[English people|Englishman]] [[Matthew Boulton]], he had succeeded by 1778 in perfecting his [[Watt steam engine|steam engine]], which incorporated a series of radical improvements, notably the closing off of the upper part of the cylinder, thereby making the low-pressure steam drive the top of the piston instead of the atmosphere, use of a steam jacket and the celebrated separate steam condenser chamber.  The separate condenser did away with the cooling water that had been injected directly into the cylinder, which cooled the cylinder and wasted steam.  Likewise, the steam jacket kept steam from condensing in the cylinder, also improving efficiency.  These improvements increased engine efficiency so that Boulton &amp; Watts engines used only 20–25% as much coal per horsepower-hour as Newcomen's. Boulton and Watt opened the [[Soho Foundry]] for the manufacture of such engines in 1795.

By 1783 the Watt steam engine had been fully developed into a [[Single- and double-acting cylinders|double-acting]] rotative type, which meant that it could be used to directly drive the rotary machinery of a factory or mill. Both of Watt's basic engine types were commercially very successful, and by 1800, the firm [[Boulton and Watt|Boulton &amp; Watt]] had constructed 496 engines, with 164 driving reciprocating pumps, 24 serving [[blast furnace]]s, and 308 powering mill machinery; most of the engines generated from {{convert|5|to|10|hp|abbr=on}}.

Until about 1800 the most common pattern of steam engine was the [[beam engine]], built as an integral part of a stone or brick engine-house, but soon various patterns of self-contained rotative engines (readily removable, but not on wheels) were developed, such as the [[table engine]]. Around the start of the 19th century, at which time the Boulton and Watt patent expired, the Cornish engineer [[Richard Trevithick]] and the American [[Oliver Evans]] began to construct higher-pressure non-condensing steam engines, exhausting against the atmosphere. High pressure yielded an engine and boiler compact enough to be used on mobile road and rail [[locomotive]]s and [[steamboat|steam boats]].

The development of [[machine tool]]s, such as the engine [[lathe]], [[Planer (metalworking)|planing]], milling and shaping machines powered by these engines, enabled all the metal parts of the engines to be easily and accurately cut and in turn made it possible to build larger and more powerful engines.

Small industrial power requirements continued to be provided by animal and human muscle until widespread [[electrification]] in the early 20th century. These included [[crank (mechanism)|crank]]-powered, [[treadle]]-powered and horse-powered workshop and light industrial machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter&amp;Bryant|1991|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Machine tools===
{{Main|Machine tool}}
{{See also|Interchangeable parts}}
[[File:Maudslay screw-cutting lathes of circa 1797 and 1800.png|thumb|[[Henry Maudslay|Maudslay]]'s famous early [[screw-cutting lathe]]s of circa 1797 and 1800]]
[[File:Middletown milling machine 1818--001.png|thumb|The Middletown [[milling (machining)|milling machine]] of circa 1818, associated with Robert Johnson and Simeon North]]

Pre-industrial machinery was built by various craftsmen – [[millwright]]s built water and windmills, [[carpenter]]s made wooden framing, and smiths and turners made metal parts. Wooden components had the disadvantage of changing dimensions with temperature and humidity, and the various joints tended to rack (work loose) over time.  As the Industrial Revolution progressed, machines with metal parts and frames became more common.  Other important uses of metal parts were in firearms and threaded fasteners, such as machine screws, bolts and nuts. There was also the need for precision in making parts.  Precision would allow better working machinery, interchangeability of parts and standardization of threaded fasteners.

The demand for metal parts led to the development of several [[machine tool]]s. They have their origins in the tools developed in the 18th century by makers of clocks and watches and scientific instrument makers to enable them to batch-produce small mechanisms.

Before the advent of machine tools, metal was worked manually using the basic hand tools of hammers, files, scrapers, saws and chisels. Consequently, the use of metal machine parts was kept to a minimum.  Hand methods of production were very laborious and costly and precision was difficult to achieve.&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;

The first large precision machine tool was the cylinder [[Boring (manufacturing)|boring machine]] invented by [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]] in 1774. It used for boring the large-diameter cylinders on early steam engines. Wilkinson's boring machine differed from earlier [[cantilever]]ed machines used for boring cannon in that the cutting tool was mounted on a beam that ran through the cylinder being bored and was supported outside on both ends.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;

The [[Planer (metalworking)|planing machine]], the [[milling (machining)|milling machine]] and the [[Shaper|shaping machine]] were developed in the early decades of the 19th century. Although the milling machine was invented at this time, it was not developed as a serious workshop tool until somewhat later in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;

[[Henry Maudslay]], who trained a school of machine tool makers early in the 19th century, was a mechanic with superior ability who had been employed at the [[Royal Arsenal]], [[Woolwich]]. He worked as an apprentice in the Royal Gun Foundry of [[Jan Verbruggen]]. In 1774 [[Jan Verbruggen]] had installed a [[horizontal boring machine]] in Woolwich which was the first industrial size [[Lathe]] in the UK. Maudslay was hired away by [[Joseph Bramah]] for the production of high-security metal locks that required precision craftsmanship.  Bramah patented a lathe that had similarities to the slide rest lathe.  Maudslay perfected the slide rest lathe, which could cut machine screws of different thread pitches by using changeable gears between the spindle and the lead screw.  Before its invention screws could not be cut to any precision using various earlier lathe designs, some of which copied from a template.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;{{rp|392–95}}  The slide rest lathe was called one of history's most important inventions.  Although it was not entirely Maudslay's idea, he was the first person to build a functional lathe using a combination of known innovations of the lead screw, slide rest and change gears.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;{{rp|31, 36}}

Maudslay left Bramah's employment and set up his own shop. He was engaged to build the machinery for making ships' pulley blocks for the [[Royal Navy]] in the [[Portsmouth Block Mills]]. These machines were all-metal and were the first machines for [[mass production]] and making components with a degree of [[Interchangeable parts|interchangeability]]. The lessons Maudslay learned about the need for stability and precision he adapted to the development of machine tools, and in his workshops he trained a generation of men to build on his work, such as [[Richard Roberts (engineer)|Richard Roberts]], [[Joseph Clement]] and [[Joseph Whitworth]].&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;

[[James Fox (engineer)|James Fox]] of [[Derby]] had a healthy export trade in machine tools for the first third of the century, as did [[Matthew Murray]] of Leeds. Roberts was a maker of high-quality machine tools and a pioneer of the use of jigs and gauges for precision workshop measurement.

The impact of machine tools during the Industrial Revolution was not that great because other than firearms, threaded fasteners and a few other industries there were few mass-produced metal parts. The techniques to make mass-produced metal parts made with sufficient precision to be [[Interchangeable parts|interchangeable]] is largely attributed to a program of the U.S. Department of War which perfected [[interchangeable parts]] for firearms in the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984"&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the half century following the invention of the fundamental machine tools the [[machine industry]] became the largest industrial sector of the U.S. economy, by value added.&lt;ref name="faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu"&gt;Economics 323–2: Economic History of the United States Since 1865 http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~jmokyr/Graphs-and-Tables.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemicals===
The large-scale production of [[Chemical substance|chemicals]] was an important development during the Industrial Revolution. The first of these was the production of [[Sulfuric acid|sulphuric acid]] by the [[lead chamber process]] invented by the Englishman [[John Roebuck]] ([[James Watt]]'s first partner) in 1746. He was able to greatly increase the scale of the manufacture by replacing the relatively expensive glass vessels formerly used with larger, less expensive chambers made of [[rivet]]ed sheets of [[lead]]. Instead of making a small amount each time, he was able to make around {{convert|100|lb|-1}} in each of the chambers, at least a tenfold increase.

The production of an [[alkali]] on a large scale became an important goal as well, and [[Nicolas Leblanc]] succeeded in 1791 in introducing a method for the production of [[sodium carbonate]]. The [[Leblanc process]] was a reaction of sulphuric acid with sodium chloride to give sodium sulphate and [[hydrochloric acid]]. The [[sodium sulfate|sodium sulphate]] was heated with [[limestone]] ([[calcium carbonate]]) and coal to give a mixture of sodium carbonate and [[calcium sulfide|calcium sulphide]]. Adding water separated the soluble sodium carbonate from the calcium sulphide. The process produced a large amount of pollution (the hydrochloric acid was initially vented to the air, and calcium sulphide was a useless waste product). Nonetheless, this synthetic [[sodium carbonate|soda ash]] proved economical compared to that from burning specific plants ([[barilla]]) or from [[kelp]], which were the previously dominant sources of soda ash,&lt;ref name="Clow52"/&gt; and also to [[potash]] ([[potassium carbonate]]) produced from hardwood ashes.

These two chemicals were very important because they enabled the introduction of a host of other inventions, replacing many small-scale operations with more cost-effective and controllable processes. Sodium carbonate had many uses in the glass, textile, soap, and [[paper]] industries. Early uses for sulphuric acid included pickling (removing rust) iron and steel, and for [[bleach]]ing cloth.

The development of bleaching powder ([[calcium hypochlorite]]) by Scottish chemist [[Charles Tennant]] in about 1800, based on the discoveries of French chemist [[Claude Louis Berthollet]], revolutionised the bleaching processes in the textile industry by dramatically reducing the time required (from months to days) for the traditional process then in use, which required repeated exposure to the sun in bleach fields after soaking the textiles with alkali or sour milk. Tennant's factory at St Rollox, North [[Glasgow]], became the largest chemical plant in the world.

After 1860 the focus on chemical innovation was in [[dye]]stuffs, and Germany took world leadership, building a strong chemical industry.&lt;ref&gt;Lion Hirth, ''State, Cartels and Growth: The German Chemical Industry'' (2007) p 20&lt;/ref&gt; Aspiring chemists flocked to German universities in the 1860–1914 era to learn the latest techniques. British scientists by contrast, lacked research universities and did not train advanced students; instead, the practice was to hire German-trained chemists.&lt;ref&gt;Johann P. Murmann, ''Knowledge and competitive advantage:''
the co-evolution of firms, technology, and national institutions ''(2003) pp&amp;nbsp;53–54''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cement===
[[File:Thamestunnel.jpg|thumb|The [[Thames Tunnel]] (opened 1843).&lt;br /&gt;[[Cement]] was used in the world's first underwater tunnel.]]
In 1824 [[Joseph Aspdin]], a British [[bricklayer]] turned builder, patented a chemical process for making [[portland cement]] which was an important advance in the building trades. This process involves [[sintering]] a mixture of [[clay]] and [[limestone]] to about {{convert|1400|°C|0|abbr=on}}, then [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]] it into a fine powder which is then mixed with water, sand and [[gravel]] to produce [[concrete]]. Portland cement was used by the famous English engineer [[Marc Isambard Brunel]] several years later when constructing the [[Thames Tunnel]].&lt;ref name="memphis"/&gt; Cement was used on a large scale in the construction of the [[London sewerage system]] a generation later.

===Gas lighting===
{{Main|Gas lighting}}
Another major industry of the later Industrial Revolution was [[gas lighting]]. Though others made a similar innovation elsewhere, the large-scale introduction of this was the work of [[William Murdoch]], an employee of Boulton &amp; Watt, the [[Birmingham]] [[Watt steam engine|steam engine]] pioneers. The process consisted of the large-scale gasification of coal in furnaces, the purification of the gas (removal of sulphur, ammonia, and heavy hydrocarbons), and its storage and distribution. The first gas lighting utilities were established in London between 1812 and 1820. They soon became one of the major consumers of coal in the UK. Gas lighting affected social and industrial organisation because it allowed factories and stores to remain open longer than with tallow candles or oil. Its introduction allowed nightlife to flourish in cities and towns as interiors and streets could be lighted on a larger scale than before.

===Glass making===
{{Main|Glass production}}
[[File:Crystal Palace interior.jpg|thumb|The Crystal Palace held the [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition]] of 1851]]
A new method of producing glass, known as the [[Cylinder blown sheet glass|cylinder process]], was developed in Europe during the early 19th century. In 1832 this process was used by the [[Chance Brothers]] to create sheet glass. They became the leading producers of window and plate glass. This advancement allowed for larger panes of glass to be created without interruption, thus freeing up the space planning in interiors as well as the fenestration of buildings. [[The Crystal Palace]] is the supreme example of the use of sheet glass in a new and innovative structure.

===Paper machine===
{{Main|Paper machine}}
A machine for making a continuous sheet of paper on a loop of wire fabric was patented in 1798 by Nicholas Louis Robert who worked for [[Saint-Léger Didot]] family in France. The paper machine is known as a Fourdrinier after the financiers, brothers Sealy and [[Henry Fourdrinier]], who were [[stationers]] in London. Although greatly improved and with many variations, the Fourdriner machine is the predominant means of paper production today.

The method of [[continuous production]] demonstrated by the paper machine influenced the development of continuous rolling of iron and later steel and other [[continuous production]] processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Industrial technologies that affected farming included the [[seed drill]], the [[British Agricultural Revolution#The Dutch and Rotherham swing (wheel-less) plough|Dutch plough]], which contained iron parts, and the threshing machine.

[[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|Jethro Tull]] invented an improved seed drill in 1701. It was a mechanical seeder which distributed seeds evenly across a plot of land and planted them at the correct depth.  This was important because the yield of seeds harvested to seeds planted at that time was around four or five.  Tull's seed drill was very expensive and not very reliable and therefore did not have much of an impact. Good quality seed drills were not produced until the mid 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Temple|1986|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and was the final straw for many farm labourers, who faced near starvation, leading to the 1830 agricultural rebellion of the [[Swing Riots]].

[[Machine tools]] and metalworking techniques developed during the Industrial Revolution eventually resulted in precision manufacturing techniques in the late 19th century for mass-producing agricultural equipment, such as reapers, binders and combine harvesters.&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984"/&gt;

===Mining===
[[History of coal mining|Coal mining]] in Britain, particularly in [[South Wales]], started early. Before the steam engine, [[Open-pit mining|pits]] were often shallow [[bell pit]]s following a seam of coal along the surface, which were abandoned as the coal was extracted. In other cases, if the geology was favourable, the coal was mined by means of an [[adit]] or [[Drift mining|drift mine]] driven into the side of a hill. [[Shaft mining]] was done in some areas, but the limiting factor was the problem of removing water. It could be done by hauling buckets of water up the shaft or to a [[sough]] (a tunnel driven into a hill to drain a mine). In either case, the water had to be discharged into a stream or ditch at a level where it could flow away by gravity. The introduction of the steam pump by [[Thomas Savery]] in 1698 and the [[Newcomen steam engine]] in 1712 greatly facilitated the removal of water and enabled shafts to be made deeper, enabling more coal to be extracted. These were developments that had begun before the Industrial Revolution, but the adoption of [[John Smeaton]]'s improvements to the Newcomen engine followed by James Watt's more efficient steam engines from the 1770s reduced the fuel costs of engines, making mines more profitable.  The [[Cornish engine]], developed in the 1810s, was much more efficient than the [[Watt steam engine]].

Coal mining was very dangerous owing to the presence of [[firedamp]] in many coal seams. Some degree of safety was provided by the [[safety lamp]] which was invented in 1816 by Sir [[Humphry Davy]] and independently by [[George Stephenson]]. However, the lamps proved a false dawn because they became unsafe very quickly and provided a weak light. Firedamp explosions continued, often setting off [[coal dust]] [[explosion]]s, so casualties grew during the entire 19th century. Conditions of work were very poor, with a high casualty rate from rock falls.

===Transportation===
{{Main|Transport during the British Industrial Revolution}}
{{See also| Productivity improving technologies (economic history)#Infrastructures}}

At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, inland transport was by navigable rivers and roads, with coastal vessels employed to move heavy goods by sea. [[Wagonway]]s were used for conveying coal to rivers for further shipment, but canals had not yet been widely constructed. Animals supplied all of the motive power on land, with sails providing the motive power on the sea.  The first horse railways were introduced toward the end of the 18th century, with steam locomotives being introduced in the early decades of the 19th century.  Improving sailing technologies boosted average sailing speed 50% between 1750 and 1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Coren|first1=Michael J.|title=The speed of Europe's 18th-century sailing ships is revamping history's view of the Industrial Revolution|url=https://qz.com/1193455/the-speed-of-europes-18th-century-sailing-ships-is-revamping-historians-view-of-the-industrial-revolution/|accessdate=31 January 2018|work=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]|date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Industrial Revolution improved Britain's transport infrastructure with a turnpike road network, a canal and waterway network, and a railway network. Raw materials and finished products could be moved more quickly and cheaply than before. Improved transportation also allowed new ideas to spread quickly.

====Canals and improved waterways====
{{Main|History of the British canal system}}
[[File:Barton-on-Irwell 11.05.02R.jpg|upright|thumb|The [[Bridgewater Canal]], famous because of its commercial success, crossing the [[Manchester Ship Canal]], one of the last canals to be built.]]

Before and during the Industrial Revolution navigation on several British rivers was improved by removing obstructions, straightening curves, widening and deepening and building navigation [[Lock (water navigation)|lock]]s.  Britain had over 1000 miles of navigable rivers and streams by 1750.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;{{rp|46}}

Canals and waterways allowed bulk materials to be economically transported long distances inland.  This was because a horse could pull a barge with a load dozens of times larger than the load that could be drawn in a cart.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grübler"&gt;{{Cite book

Building of canals dates to ancient times.  The [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] in China, "the world's largest artificial waterway and oldest canal still in existence," parts of which were started between the 6th and 4th centuries BC, is {{convert|1121|mi|0|abbr=out}} long and links [[Hangzhou]] with Beijing.&lt;ref name="Langmead"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Langmead|title=Encyclopedia of Architectural and Engineering Feats|url={{Google books|T5J6GKvGbmMC|page=PA37|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|accessdate=15 February 2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-112-0|page=37|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, canals began to be built in the late 18th century to link the major manufacturing centres across the country.  Known for its huge commercial success, the [[Bridgewater Canal]] in [[North West England]], which opened in 1761 and was mostly funded by [[Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater|The 3rd Duke of Bridgewater]].  From [[Worsley]] to the rapidly growing town of [[Manchester]] its construction cost £168,000 (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|168000|1761|2013|r=-1}}}} {{As of|2013|lc=y}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Timbs|1860|p=363}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its advantages over land and river transport meant that within a year of its opening in 1761, the price of coal in Manchester fell by about half.&lt;ref name=Bridgewatercollieries&gt;{{Citation |title=The Times newspaper: Bridgewater Collieries | url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?toDate=1985-12-31&amp;fromDate=1785-01-01&amp;currentPageNumber=1&amp;resultsPerPage=10&amp;sortBy=default&amp;offset=0&amp;viewName=&amp;addFilters=&amp;removeFilters=&amp;addCat=&amp;queryKeywords=bridgewater+canal&amp;sectionId=1040&amp;currPgSmartSet=1&amp;pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1913-12-01-08&amp;articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1913-12-01-08-001&amp;xmlpath=&amp;pubId=17&amp;totalResults=1638&amp;addRefineFilters=&amp;removeRefineFilters=&amp;addRefineCat=&amp;next_Page=false&amp;prev_Page=false&amp;date_dd_From=1&amp;date_mm_From=01&amp;date_yyyy_From=1785&amp;date_dd_to_range=31&amp;date_mm_to_range=12&amp;date_yyyy_to_range=1985&amp;date_dd_from_precise=1&amp;date_mm_from_precise=01&amp;date_yyyy_from_precise=1785&amp;isDateSearch=false&amp;dateSearchType=range&amp;refineQuerykeywordText= |date=1 December 1913 |accessdate=19 July 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This success helped inspire a period of intense canal building, known as [[Canal Mania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kindleberger|1993|pp=192–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; New canals were hastily built in the aim of replicating the commercial success of the Bridgewater Canal, the most notable being the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] and the [[Thames and Severn Canal]] which opened in 1774 and 1789 respectively.

By the 1820s a national network was in existence. Canal construction served as a model for the organisation and methods later used to construct the railways. They were eventually largely superseded as profitable commercial enterprises by the spread of the railways from the 1840s on. The last major canal to be built in the United Kingdom was the [[Manchester Ship Canal]], which upon opening in 1894 was the largest [[ship canal]] in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=1 January 1894: Opening of the Manchester ship canal |quote=Six years in the making, the world's largest navigation canal gives the city direct access to the sea |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/may/17/guardian190-manchester-ship-canal-opens |newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 January 1894 |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opened Manchester as a [[Port of Manchester|port]]. However it never achieved the commercial success its sponsors had hoped for and signalled canals as a dying mode of transport in an age dominated by railways, which were quicker and often cheaper.

Britain's canal network, together with its surviving mill buildings, is one of the most enduring features of the early Industrial Revolution to be seen in Britain.

====Roads====
[[File:Rakeman – First American Macadam Road.jpg|thumb|left|Construction of the first macadam road in the United States (1823).

Much of the original British road system was poorly maintained by thousands of local parishes, but from the 1720s (and occasionally earlier) [[Toll road|turnpike]] trusts were set up to charge tolls and maintain some roads. Increasing numbers of main roads were turnpiked from the 1750s to the extent that almost every main road in England and Wales was the responsibility of a [[Turnpike trusts|turnpike trust]]. New engineered roads were built by [[John Metcalf (civil engineer)|John Metcalf]], [[Thomas Telford]] and most notably [[John Loudon McAdam|John McAdam]], with the first '[[macadam]]ised' stretch of road being Marsh Road at Ashton Gate, Bristol in 1816.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Brown (1991). "Society and Economy in Modern Britain 1700–1850" p. 136. Routledge, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; The major turnpikes radiated from London and were the means by which the Royal Mail was able to reach the rest of the country. Heavy goods transport on these roads was by means of slow, broad wheeled, carts hauled by teams of horses. Lighter goods were conveyed by smaller carts or by teams of [[Packhorse|pack horse]]. Stagecoaches carried the rich, and the less wealthy could pay to ride on [[Un-sprung cart|carriers carts]].

====Railways====

[[File:Opening Liverpool and Manchester Railway.jpg|thumb|Painting depicting the [[opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] in 1830, the first inter-city railway in the world and which spawned [[Railway Mania]] due to its success.]]

Reducing friction was one of the major reasons for the success of railroads compared to wagons. This was demonstrated on an iron plate covered wooden tramway in 1805 at Croydon, England.
&lt;blockquote&gt;“A good horse on an ordinary turnpike road can draw two thousand pounds, or one ton.  A party of gentlemen were invited to witness the experiment, that the superiority of the new road might be established by ocular demonstration.  Twelve wagons were loaded with stones, till each wagon weighed three tons, and the wagons were fastened together.  A horse was then attached, which drew the wagons with ease, six miles in two hours, having stopped four times, in order to show he had the power of starting, as well as drawing his great load.”&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Railways were made practical by the widespread introduction of inexpensive [[puddling (metallurgy)|puddled iron]] after 1800, the [[Rolling (metalworking)|rolling mill]] for making rails, and the development of the high-pressure steam engine also around 1800.

Wagonways for moving coal in the mining areas had started in the 17th century and were often associated with canal or river systems for the further movement of coal. These were all horse drawn or relied on gravity, with a stationary steam engine to haul the wagons back to the top of the incline. The first applications of the steam [[locomotive]] were on wagon or plate ways (as they were then often called from the cast-iron plates used). Horse-drawn public railways did not begin until the early years of the 19th century when improvements to pig and wrought iron production were lowering costs. See: [[Industrial Revolution#Metallurgy|Metallurgy]]

Steam locomotives began being built after the introduction of high-pressure steam engines after the expiration of the [[Boulton and Watt]] patent in 1800. High-pressure engines exhausted used steam to the atmosphere, doing away with the condenser and cooling water.  They were also much lighter weight and smaller in size for a given horsepower than the stationary condensing engines.  A few of these early locomotives were used in mines.  Steam-hauled public railways began with the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] in 1825.

The rapid introduction of railways followed the 1829 [[Rainhill Trials]], which demonstrated [[Robert Stephenson]]'s successful locomotive design and the 1828 development of [[Hot blast]], which dramatically reduced the fuel consumption of making iron and increased the capacity the [[blast furnace]].

On 15 September 1830, the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] was opened, the first inter-city railway in the world and was attended by Prime Minister, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert L. Sussman (2009). "Victorian Technology: Invention, Innovation, and the Rise of the Machine". p. 2. ABC-CLIO, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The railway was engineered by [[Joseph Locke]] and [[George Stephenson]], linked the rapidly expanding industrial town of [[Manchester]] with the port town of [[Liverpool]]. The [[opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway|opening]] was marred by problems, due to the primitive nature of the technology being employed, however problems were gradually ironed out and the railway became highly successful, transporting passengers and freight. The success of the inter-city railway, particularly in the transport of freight and commodities, led to [[Railway Mania]].

Construction of major railways connecting the larger cities and towns began in the 1830s but only gained momentum at the very end of the first Industrial Revolution. After many of the workers had completed the railways, they did not return to their rural lifestyles but instead remained in the cities, providing additional workers for the factories.

Other developments included more efficient [[water wheel]]s, based on experiments conducted by the British engineer [[John Smeaton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Social effects==
{{Main|Life in Great Britain during the Industrial Revolution}}

===Factory system===
{{Main|Factory system}}
Prior to the Industrial Revolution, most of the workforce was employed in agriculture, either as self-employed farmers as landowners or tenants, or as landless agricultural labourers. It was common for families in various parts of the world to spin yarn, weave cloth and make their own clothing.  Households also spun and wove for market production.  At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution India, China and regions of Iraq and elsewhere in Asia and the Middle East produced most of the world's cotton cloth while Europeans produced wool and linen goods.

In Britain by the 16th century the [[putting-out system]], by which farmers and townspeople produced goods for market in their homes, often described as ''cottage industry'', was being practiced.  Typical putting out system goods included spinning and weaving.  Merchant capitalist typically provided the raw materials, paid workers by the [[Piece work|piece]], and were responsible for the sale of the goods.  Embezzlement of supplies by workers and poor quality were common problems.  The logistical effort in procuring and distributing raw materials and picking up finished goods were also limitations of the putting out system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|pp=57–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some early spinning and weaving machinery, such as a [[spinning jenny|40 spindle jenny]] for about six pounds in 1792,  was affordable for cottagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later machinery such as spinning frames, [[spinning mule]]s and power looms were expensive (especially if water powered), giving rise to capitalist ownership of factories.

The majority of textile factory workers during the Industrial Revolution were unmarried women and children, including many orphans.  They typically worked for 12 to 14 hours per day with only Sundays off.  It was common for women take factory jobs seasonally during slack periods of farm work.  Lack of adequate transportation, long hours and poor pay made it difficult to recruit and maintain workers.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;	Many workers, such as displaced farmers and agricultural workers, who had nothing but their labour to sell, became factory workers out of necessity.  (See: [[British Agricultural Revolution]], [[Threshing machine]])

The change in the social relationship of the factory worker compared to farmers and cottagers was viewed unfavourably by [[Karl Marx]], however, he recognized the increase in productivity made possible by technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Standards of living===
Some economists, such as [[Robert Lucas, Jr.|Robert E. Lucas, Jr.]], say that the real impact of the Industrial Revolution was that "for the first time in history, the living standards of the masses of ordinary people have begun to undergo sustained growth&amp;nbsp;... Nothing remotely like this economic behaviour is mentioned by the classical economists, even as a theoretical possibility."&lt;ref name="Lectures on Economic Growth"/&gt; Others, however, argue that while growth of the economy's overall productive powers was unprecedented during the Industrial Revolution, living standards for the majority of the population did not grow meaningfully until the late 19th and 20th centuries, and that in many ways workers' living standards declined under early capitalism: for instance, studies have shown that real wages in Britain only increased 15% between the 1780s and 1850s, and that life expectancy in Britain did not begin to dramatically increase until the 1870s.&lt;ref name="Feinstein2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feinstein|first=Charles|title=Pessimism Perpetuated: Real Wages and the Standard of Living in Britain during and after the Industrial Revolution|journal=Journal of Economic History|date=September 1998|volume=58|issue=3|pages=625–58|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=4123540|accessdate=6 May 2014|doi=10.1017/s0022050700021100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SzreterMooney2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Szreter &amp; Mooney|title=Urbanization, Mortality, and the Standard of Living Debate: New Estimates of the Expectation of Life at Birth in Nineteenth-Century British Cities|journal=The Economic History Review|date=February 1998|volume=51|issue=1|page=104|doi=10.1111/1468-0289.00084|last2=Mooney}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the average height of the population declined during the Industrial Revolution, implying that their nutritional status was also decreasing. Real wages were not keeping up with the price of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Küchenhoff |first1=Helmut |date=2012 |title=The Diminution of Physical Stature of the British Male Population in the 18th-Century |url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/afc/cliome/v6y2012i1p45-62.html |journal=Cliometrica |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=45–62 |access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Snowdon |first1=Brian |date=April–June 2005 |title=Measures of Progress and Other Tall Stories: From Income to Anthropometrics |url=https://www.worldeconomics.com/Journal/Papers/Measures%20of%20Progress%20and%20Other%20Tall%20Stories.details?ID=209 |journal=World Economics |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=87–136 |access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Industrial Revolution, the [[life expectancy]] of children increased dramatically. The percentage of the children born in London who died before the age of five decreased from 74.5% in 1730–1749 to 31.8% in 1810–1829.&lt;ref name="Buer"/&gt;

The effects on living conditions the industrial revolution have been very controversial, and were hotly debated by economic and social historians from the 1950s to the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Woodward81"/&gt; A series of 1950s essays by [[Henry Phelps Brown]] and Sheila V. Hopkins later set the academic consensus that the bulk of the population, that was at the bottom of the social ladder, suffered severe reductions in their living standards.&lt;ref name="Woodward81"/&gt; During 1813–1913, there was a significant increase in worker wages.&lt;ref name="Trends in Real Wages in Britain, 1750-1913"/&gt;&lt;ref name="econlib"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hartwell"/&gt;

====Food and nutrition====
{{Main|British Agricultural Revolution}}
Chronic hunger and malnutrition were the norm for the majority of the population of the world including Britain and France, until the late 19th century. Until about 1750, in large part due to malnutrition, life expectancy in France was about 35 years and about 40 years in Britain. The United States population of the time was adequately fed, much taller on average and had life expectancy of 45–50 years although U.S. life expectancy declined by a few years by the mid 19th century. Food consumption per capita also declined during an episode known as the [[Antebellum Puzzle]].&lt;ref name="The Escape from Hunger and Premature Death, 1700-2100"/&gt;

Food supply in Great Britain was adversely affected by the [[Corn Laws]] (1815-1846).  The Corn Laws, which imposed tariffs on imported grain, were enacted to keep prices high in order to benefit domestic producers.  The Corn Laws were repealed in the early years of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]].

The initial technologies of the Industrial Revolution, such as mechanized textiles, iron and coal, did little, if anything, to lower food prices.&lt;ref name="Pomeranz 2000"/&gt; In Britain and the Netherlands, food supply increased before the Industrial Revolution due to better agricultural practices; however, population grew too, as noted by [[Thomas Malthus]].&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

====Housing====
The very rapid growth in population in the 19th century in the cities included the new industrial and manufacturing cities, as well as service centers such as Edinburgh and London.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory  Clark,  "Shelter from the storm: housing and the industrial revolution, 1550–1909." ''Journal of Economic History'' 62#2 (2002): 489–511.&lt;/ref&gt; The critical factor was financing, which was handled by building societies that dealt directly with  large contracting firms.&lt;ref&gt;H.J. Dyos, "The speculative builders and developers of Victorian London." ''Victorian Studies'' 11 (1968): 641–90.  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3825462 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Powell, ''The British building industry since 1800: An economic history'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;   Private renting from housing landlords was the dominant tenure. P. Kemp says this was usually of advantage to tenants.&lt;ref&gt;P. Kemp, "Housing landlordism in late nineteenth-century Britain." ''Environment and Planning A'' 14.11 (1982): 1437–47.&lt;/ref&gt;  People moved in so rapidly that there was not enough capital to build adequate housing for everyone, so low-income newcomers squeezed into increasingly overcrowded slums. Clean water, sanitation, and public health facilities were inadequate; the death rate was high, especially infant mortality, and tuberculosis among young adults. [[Cholera]] from polluted water and typhoid were endemic. Unlike rural areas, there were no famines such as devastated Ireland in the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;H.J. Dyos, "The Slums of Victorian London." ''Victorian Studies'' 11.1 (1967): 5–40. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3825891 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony S. Wohl, ''The eternal slum: housing and social policy in Victorian London'' (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. Daunton, ''House and home in the Victorian city: working-class housing, 1850–1914'' (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

A large exposé literature grew up condemning the unhealthy conditions. By far the most famous publication was by one of the founders of the Socialist movement, ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England]]'' in 1844 [[Friedrich Engels]] described backstreet sections of Manchester and other mill towns, where people lived in crude shanties and shacks, some not completely enclosed, some with dirt floors.  These shanty towns had narrow walkways between irregularly shaped lots and dwellings.  There were no sanitary facilities. Population density was extremely high.&lt;ref&gt;Enid Gauldie, ''Cruel habitations: a history of working-class housing 1780-1918''  (Allen &amp; Unwin, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt;  Not everyone lived in such poor conditions. The Industrial Revolution also created a middle class of businessmen, clerks, foremen and engineers who lived in much better conditions.

Conditions improved over the course of the 19th century due to new public health acts regulating things such as sewage, hygiene and home construction. In the introduction of his 1892 edition, Engels notes that most of the conditions he wrote about in 1844 had been greatly improved. For example, the [[Public Health Act 1875]] led to the more sanitary [[byelaw terraced house]].

====Sanitation====
In ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England]]'' in 1844 [[Friedrich Engels]] described how untreated sewage created awful odors and turned the rivers green in industrial cities.

In 1854 [[John Snow]] traced a cholera outbreak in Soho to fecal contamination of a public water well by a home cesspit.  Snow's findings that cholera could be spread by contaminated water took some years to be accepted, but his work led to fundamental changes in the design of public water and waste systems.

====Water supply====
Pre-industrial water supply relied on gravity systems and pumping of water was done by water wheels.  Pipes were typically made of wood.  Steam powered pumps and iron pipes allowed the widespread piping of water to horse watering troughs and households.&lt;ref name="Hunter_1985"/&gt;

====Increase in literacy====
The invention of the [[paper machine]] and the application of steam power to the industrial processes of [[printing]] supported a massive expansion of newspaper and popular book publishing, which contributed to rising literacy and demands for mass political participation.

===Clothing and consumer goods===
[[File:BLW Tea and coffee service, Staffordshire.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wedgwood]] tea and coffee service]]
Consumers benefited from falling prices for clothing and household articles such as cast iron cooking utensils, and in the following decades, stoves for cooking and space heating.  Coffee, tea, sugar, tobacco and chocolate became affordable to many in Europe.  Watches and household clocks became popular consumer items.

Meeting the demands of the consumer revolution and growth in wealth of the middle classes in Britain, potter and entrepreneur [[Josiah Wedgwood]], founder of [[Wedgwood]] fine china and porcelain, created goods such as [[tableware]], which was starting to become a common feature on dining tables.&lt;ref name="Black"/&gt;

===Population increase===
The Industrial Revolution was the first period in history during which there was a simultaneous increase in both population and per capita income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Industrial Revolution|last=Hudson|first= Pat|year=1992 |publisher =Routledge, Chapman and Hall, Inc.
|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-7131-6531-9|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Robert Hughes in ''The Fatal Shore'', the [[Demography of England|population of England]] and Wales, which had remained steady at six million from 1700 to 1740, rose dramatically after 1740. The population of England had more than doubled from 8.3 million in 1801 to 16.8 million in 1850 and, by 1901, had nearly doubled again to 30.5 million.&lt;ref name="statistics"/&gt;  Improved conditions led to the population of Britain increasing from 10 million to 40 million in the 1800s.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; Europe's population increased from about 100 million in 1700 to 400 million by 1900.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

===Urbanization===
The growth of modern industry since the late 18th century led to massive [[urbanisation]] and the rise of new great cities, first in Europe and then in other regions, as new opportunities brought huge numbers of migrants from rural communities into urban areas.  In 1800, only 3% of the world's population lived in cities,&lt;ref name="prb"/&gt; compared to nearly 50% today (the beginning of the 21st century).&lt;ref name="prb6"/&gt; Manchester had a population of 10,000 in 1717, but by 1911 it had burgeoned to 2.3 million.&lt;ref name="britannica7"/&gt;

===Impact on women and family life===
Women's historians have debated the effect of the Industrial Revolution and capitalism generally on the status of women.&lt;ref&gt;Eleanor Amico, ed. ''Reader's guide to women's studies'' (1998) pp 102–4, 306–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janet Thomas, "Women and capitalism: oppression or emancipation? A review article." ''Comparative studies in society and history'' 30#3 (1988): 534–49. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/178999 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Taking a pessimistic side, [[Alice Clark]] argued that when capitalism arrived in 17th century England, it lowered the status of women as they lost much of their economic importance. Clark argues that in 16th-century England, women were engaged in many aspects of industry and agriculture. The home was a central unit of production and women played a vital role in running farms, and in some trades and landed estates. Their useful economic roles gave them a sort of equality with their husbands. However, Clark argues, as capitalism expanded in the 17th century, there was more and more division of labour with the husband taking paid labour jobs outside the home, and the wife reduced to unpaid household work. Middle- and upper-class women were confined to an idle domestic existence, supervising servants; lower-class women were forced to take poorly paid jobs. Capitalism, therefore, had a negative effect on powerful women.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Clark, ''Working life of women in the seventeenth century'' (1919).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a more positive interpretation, [[Ivy Pinchbeck]] argues that capitalism created the conditions for women's emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;Ivy Pinchbeck, ''Women Workers in the Industrial Revolution'' (1930).&lt;/ref&gt;  Tilly and Scott have emphasised the continuity in the status of women, finding three stages in English history. In the pre-industrial era, production was mostly for home use and women produce much of the needs of the households. The second stage was the "family wage economy" of early industrialisation; the entire family depended on the collective wages of its members, including husband, wife and older children. The third or modern stage is the "family consumer economy," in which the family is the site of consumption, and women are employed in large numbers in retail and clerical jobs to support rising standards of consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Tilly and Joan Wallach Scott, ''Women, work, and family'' (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideas of thrift and hard work characterized middle-class families as the Industrial Revolution swept Europe. These values were displayed in Samuel Smiles' book ''Self-Help'', in which he states that the misery of the poorer classes was "voluntary and self-imposed - the results of idleness, thriftlessness, intemperance, and misconduct."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thrift|last=Smiles|first=Samuel|publisher=John Murray|year=1875|isbn=|location=London|pages=30–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labour conditions===

====Social structure and working conditions====
In terms of social structure, the Industrial Revolution witnessed the triumph of a [[middle class]] of industrialists and businessmen over a landed class of nobility and gentry. Ordinary working people found increased opportunities for employment in the new mills and factories, but these were often under strict working conditions with long hours of labour dominated by a pace set by machines. As late as the year 1900, most industrial workers in the United States still worked a 10-hour day (12 hours in the steel industry), yet earned from 20% to 40% less than the minimum deemed necessary for a decent life;&lt;ref name="countrystudies"/&gt; however, most workers in textiles, which was by far the leading industry in terms of employment, were women and children.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;  For workers of the laboring classes, industrial life "was a stony desert, which they had to make habitable by their own efforts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Industry and Empire: From 1750 to the Present Day|last=Hobsbawm|first=Eric J.|publisher=Penguin|year=1969|isbn=978-1565845619|volume=3|location=Harmondsworth, England|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, harsh working conditions were prevalent long before the Industrial Revolution took place. [[Pre-industrial society]] was very static and often cruel – [[child labour]], dirty living conditions, and long working hours were just as prevalent before the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name="industrial4"/&gt;

====Factories and urbanisation====
{{Main|Factory system}}
[[File:Cottonopolis1.jpg|thumb|left|Manchester, England ("[[Cottonopolis]]"), pictured in 1840, showing the mass of factory chimneys]]

Industrialisation led to the creation of the [[factory]]. The factory system contributed to the growth of urban areas, as large numbers of workers migrated into the cities in search of work in the factories. Nowhere was this better illustrated than the mills and associated industries of Manchester, nicknamed "[[Cottonopolis]]", and the world's first industrial city.&lt;ref name="Industrial city"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/on-line/energyhall/page84.asp |title=Manchester – the first industrial city |publisher=Entry on Sciencemuseum website |accessdate=17 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309184810/http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/on-line/energyhall/page84.asp |archivedate=9 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manchester experienced a six-times increase in its population between 1771 and 1831. Bradford grew by 50% every ten years between 1811 and 1851 and by 1851 only 50% of the population of Bradford was actually born there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/industrial_revolution_towns.htm|title=Life in Industrial Towns|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, between 1815 and 1939, 20 percent of Europe's population left home, pushed by poverty, a rapidly growing population, and the displacement of peasant farming and artisan manufacturing. They were pulled abroad by the enormous demand for labor overseas, the ready availability of land, and cheap transportation. Still, many did not find a satisfactory life in their new homes, leading 7 million of them to return to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultures in Contact|last=Hoeder|first=Dirk|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=Durham, North Carolina|pages=331–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mass migration had large demographic impacts: in 1800, less than one percent of the world population consisted of overseas Europeans and their descendants; by 1930, they represented 11 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=America in the World|last=Guarneri|first=Carl|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2007|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Americas felt the brunt of this huge emigration, largely concentrated in the United States.

For much of the 19th century, production was done in small mills, which were typically [[List of watermills in the United Kingdom|water-powered]] and built to serve local needs. Later, each factory would have its own steam engine and a chimney to give an efficient draft through its boiler.

In other industries, the transition to factory production was not so divisive. Some industrialists themselves tried to improve factory and living conditions for their workers. One of the earliest such reformers was [[Robert Owen]], known for his pioneering efforts in improving conditions for workers at the [[Robert Owen#Philanthropy in New Lanark (1800)|New Lanark mills]], and often regarded as one of the key thinkers of the [[Utopian socialism|early socialist movement]].

By 1746 an integrated [[brass mill]] was working at [[Warmley]] near [[Bristol]]. Raw material went in at one end, was smelted into brass and was turned into pans, pins, wire, and other goods. Housing was provided for workers on site. [[Josiah Wedgwood]] and [[Matthew Boulton]] (whose [[Soho Manufactory]] was completed in 1766) were other prominent early industrialists, who employed the factory system.

====Child labour====
{{see also|Child labour#The Industrial Revolution}}
[[File:coaltub.png|right|frame|A young "drawer" pulling a coal tub along a mine gallery.&lt;ref name="From Coal Mine Upwards: or Seventy Years of an Eventful Life"/&gt; In Britain laws passed in 1842 and 1844 improved mine working conditions.]]

The Industrial Revolution led to a population increase but the chances of surviving childhood did not improve throughout the Industrial Revolution, although ''infant'' mortality rates were reduced markedly.&lt;ref name="Buer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Demographic Transition and Industrial Revolution: A Macroeconomic Investigation"/&gt; There was still limited opportunity for education and children were expected to work. Employers could pay a child less than an adult even though their productivity was comparable; there was no need for strength to operate an industrial machine, and since the industrial system was completely new, there were no experienced adult labourers. This made child labour the labour of choice for manufacturing in the early phases of the Industrial Revolution between the 18th and 19th centuries. In England and Scotland in 1788, two-thirds of the workers in 143 water-powered [[cotton mill]]s were described as children.&lt;ref name="galbithink"/&gt;

[[Child labour]] existed before the Industrial Revolution but with the increase in population and education it became more visible. Many children were forced to work in relatively bad conditions for much lower pay than their elders,&lt;ref name="victorianweb"/&gt; 10–20% of an adult male's wage.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Children as young as four were employed.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Beatings and long hours were common, with some child [[coal mine]]rs and [[hurrying|hurriers]] working from 4 am until 5 pm.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Conditions were dangerous, with some children killed when they dozed off and fell into the path of the carts, while others died from gas explosions.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Many children developed [[lung cancer]] and other diseases and died before the age of 25.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; [[Workhouses]] would sell orphans and abandoned children as "pauper apprentices", working without wages for board and lodging.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Those who ran away would be whipped and returned to their masters, with some masters [[Shackle|shackling]] them to prevent escape.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Children employed as [[mule scavenger]]s by [[cotton mill]]s would crawl under machinery to pick up cotton, working 14 hours a day, six days a week. Some lost hands or limbs, others were crushed under the machines, and some were decapitated.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Young girls worked at match factories, where phosphorus fumes would cause many to develop [[phossy jaw]].&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Children employed at [[Glassblowing|glassworks]] were regularly burned and blinded, and those working at [[pottery|potteries]] were vulnerable to poisonous clay dust.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt;

Reports were written detailing some of the abuses, particularly in the coal mines&lt;ref name="Testimony Gathered by Ashley's Mines Commission"/&gt; and textile factories,&lt;ref name="The Life of the Industrial Worker in Nineteenth-Century England"/&gt; and these helped to popularise the children's plight. The public outcry, especially among the upper and middle classes, helped stir change in the young workers' welfare.

Politicians and the government tried to limit child labour by law but factory owners resisted; some felt that they were aiding the poor by giving their children money to buy food to avoid [[starvation]], and others simply welcomed the cheap labour. In 1833 and 1844, the first general laws against child labour, the [[Factory Acts]], were passed in Britain: Children younger than nine were not allowed to work, children were not permitted to work at night, and the work day of youth under the age of 18 was limited to twelve hours. Factory inspectors supervised the execution of the law, however, their scarcity made enforcement difficult.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; About ten years later, the employment of children and women in mining was forbidden. Although laws such as these decreased the number of child labourers, child labour remained significantly present in Europe and the United States until the 20th century.&lt;ref name="archives"/&gt;

====Organisation of labour====
{{See also|Trade union#History}}
The Industrial Revolution concentrated labour into mills, factories and mines, thus facilitating the organisation of ''combinations'' or [[trade union]]s to help advance the interests of working people. The power of a union could demand better terms by withdrawing all labour and causing a consequent cessation of production. Employers had to decide between giving in to the union demands at a cost to themselves or suffering the cost of the lost production. Skilled workers were hard to replace, and these were the first groups to successfully advance their conditions through this kind of bargaining.

The main method the unions used to effect change was [[strike action]]. Many strikes were painful events for both sides, the unions and the management. In Britain, the [[Combination Act 1799]] forbade workers to form any kind of trade union until its repeal in 1824. Even after this, unions were still severely restricted. One British newspaper in 1834 described unions as "the most dangerous institutions that were ever permitted to take root, under shelter of law, in any country..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Tolpuddle Martyrs|last=Evatt|first=Herbert|publisher=Sydney University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0586038321|location=Sydney|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1832, the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Act]] extended the vote in Britain but did not grant universal suffrage. That year six men from [[Tolpuddle]] in Dorset founded the Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers to protest against the gradual lowering of wages in the 1830s. They refused to work for less than ten shillings a week, although by this time wages had been reduced to seven shillings a week and were due to be further reduced to six. In 1834 James Frampton, a local landowner, wrote to the Prime Minister, [[Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]], to complain about the union, invoking an obscure law from 1797 prohibiting people from swearing oaths to each other, which the members of the Friendly Society had done. James Brine, James Hammett, George Loveless, George's brother James Loveless, George's brother in-law Thomas Standfield, and Thomas's son John Standfield were arrested, found guilty, and transported to Australia. They became known as the [[Tolpuddle Martyrs]]. In the 1830s and 1840s, the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement was the first large-scale organised working class political movement which campaigned for political equality and social justice. Its ''Charter'' of reforms received over three million signatures but was rejected by Parliament without consideration.

Working people also formed [[Friendly society|friendly societies]] and [[Cooperative|co-operative societies]] as mutual support groups against times of economic hardship. Enlightened industrialists, such as [[Robert Owen]] also supported these organisations to improve the conditions of the working class.

Unions slowly overcame the legal restrictions on the right to strike. In 1842, a [[general strike]] involving cotton workers and colliers was organised through the Chartist movement which stopped production across Great Britain.&lt;ref name="archive5"/&gt;

Eventually, effective political organisation for working people was achieved through the trades unions who, after the extensions of the franchise in 1867 and 1885, began to support socialist political parties that later merged to become the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].

====Luddites====
{{Main|Luddite}}
[[File:FrameBreaking-1812.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Refer to caption|Luddites smashing a power loom in 1812]]

The rapid industrialisation of the English economy cost many craft workers their jobs. The movement started first with [[lace]] and [[hosiery]] workers near [[Nottingham]] and spread to other areas of the textile industry owing to early industrialisation. Many weavers also found themselves suddenly unemployed since they could no longer compete with machines which only required relatively limited (and unskilled) labour to produce more cloth than a single weaver. Many such unemployed workers, weavers, and others, turned their animosity towards the machines that had taken their jobs and began destroying factories and machinery. These attackers became known as Luddites, supposedly followers of [[Ned Ludd]], a folklore figure. The first attacks of the Luddite movement began in 1811. The Luddites rapidly gained popularity, and the British government took drastic measures, using the [[militia]] or [[army]] to protect industry. Those rioters who were caught were tried and hanged, or [[Penal transportation|transported]] for life.

Unrest continued in other sectors as they industrialised, such as with agricultural labourers in the 1830s when large parts of southern Britain were affected by the [[Captain Swing]] disturbances. Threshing machines were a particular target, and [[hay]]rick burning was a popular activity. However, the riots led to the first formation of [[trade union]]s, and further pressure for reform.

====Shift in production's center of gravity====
The traditional centers of hand textile production such as India, parts of the Middle East and later China could not withstand the competition from machine-made textiles, which over a period of decades destroyed the hand made textile industries and left millions of people without work, many of whom starved.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;

The Industrial Revolution also generated an enormous and unprecedented economic division in the world, as measured by the share of manufacturing output.

====Effect on cotton production and expansion of slavery====
Cheap cotton textiles increased the demand for raw cotton; previously, it had primarily been consumed in subtropical regions where it was grown, with little raw cotton available for export. Consequently, prices of raw cotton rose. Some cotton had been grown in the West Indies, particularly in [[Hispaniola]], but Haitian cotton production was halted by the [[Haitian Revolution]] in 1791. The invention of the cotton gin in 1792 allowed Georgia green seeded cotton to be profitable, leading to the widespread growth of cotton [[plantation]]s in the United States and Brazil. In 1791 world cotton production was estimated to be 490,000,000 pounds with U.S. production accounting to 2,000,000 pounds.  By 1800 U.S. production was 35,000,000 pounds, of which 17,790,000 were exported.  In 1945 the U.S. produced seven-eights of the 1,169,600,000 pounds of world production.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;{{rp|150}}

The Americas, particularly the U.S., had labor shortages and high priced labor, which made [[slavery]] attractive.  America's cotton plantations were highly efficient and profitable, and able to keep up with demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Empire of Cotton: A Global History|last=Beckert

===Impact on environment===
[[File:StRolloxChemical 1831.jpg|thumb|Levels of air pollution rose during the Industrial Revolution, sparking the first modern environmental laws to be passed in the mid-19th century.]]
The origins of the [[environmental movement]] lay in the response to increasing levels of [[smoke]] [[pollution]] in the atmosphere during the Industrial Revolution. The emergence of great factories and the concomitant immense growth in [[history of coal mining|coal consumption]] gave rise to an unprecedented level of [[air pollution]] in industrial centers; after 1900 the large volume of industrial [[chemical]] discharges added to the growing load of untreated human waste.&lt;ref name="Donora"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ametsoc.org/sloan/cleanair/ |title=History of the Clean Air Act |accessdate=14 February 2006 |first=James R. |last=Fleming |author2=Bethany R. Knorr |publisher=American Meteorological Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first large-scale, modern environmental laws came in the form of Britain's [[Alkali Acts]], passed in 1863, to regulate the deleterious air pollution ([[gaseous]] [[hydrochloric acid]]) given off by the [[Leblanc process]], used to produce [[soda ash]]. An Alkali inspector and four sub-inspectors were appointed to curb this pollution. The responsibilities of the inspectorate were gradually expanded, culminating in the Alkali Order 1958 which placed all major heavy industries that emitted [[smoke]], grit, dust and fumes under supervision.

The manufactured gas industry began in British cities in 1812–1820. The technique used produced highly toxic effluent that was dumped into sewers and rivers. The gas companies were repeatedly sued in nuisance lawsuits. They usually lost and modified the worst practices. The City of London repeatedly indicted gas companies in the 1820s for polluting the Thames and poisoning its fish. Finally, Parliament wrote company charters to regulate toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie  Tomory, "The Environmental History of the Early British Gas Industry, 1812–1830." ''Environmental history'' 17#1 (2012): 29–54.&lt;/ref&gt;  The industry reached the US around 1850 causing pollution and lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;Joel A. Tarr,  "Toxic Legacy: The Environmental Impact of the Manufactured Gas Industry in the United States." ''Technology and culture'' 55#1 (2014): 107–47. [http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1020&amp;context=history online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In industrial cities local experts and reformers, especially after 1890, took the lead in identifying environmental degradation and pollution, and initiating grass-roots movements to demand and achieve reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Harold L. Platt, ''Shock cities: the environmental transformation and reform of Manchester and Chicago'' (2005) [https://www.amazon.com/Shock-Cities-Environmental-Transformation-Manchester/dp/0226670767/  excerpt].&lt;/ref&gt; Typically the highest priority went to water and air pollution. The [[Environmental Protection UK|Coal Smoke Abatement Society]] was formed in Britain in 1898 making it one of the oldest environmental NGOs. It was founded by artist Sir [[William Blake Richmond]], frustrated with the pall cast by coal smoke. Although there were earlier pieces of legislation, the [[Public Health Act 1875]] required all furnaces and fireplaces to consume their own smoke. It also provided for sanctions against factories that emitted large amounts of black smoke. The provisions of this law were extended in 1926 with the Smoke Abatement Act to include other emissions, such as soot, ash, and gritty particles and to empower local authorities to impose their own regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Brian William Clapp, ''An environmental history of Britain since the industrial revolution'' (Routledge, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industrialisation beyond the United Kingdom==

===Continental Europe===
The Industrial Revolution on [[Continental Europe]] came a little later than in Great Britain. In many industries, this involved the application of technology developed in Britain in new places. Often the technology was purchased from Britain or British engineers and entrepreneurs moved abroad in search of new opportunities. By 1809, part of the [[Ruhr|Ruhr Valley]] in Westphalia was called 'Miniature England' because of its similarities to the industrial areas of England. The German, Russian and Belgian governments all provided state funding to the new industries. In some cases (such as [[Iron and steel industry|iron]]), the different availability of resources locally meant that only some aspects of the British technology were adopted.

====Belgium====

[[History of Belgium|Belgium]] was the second country, after Britain, in which the Industrial Revolution took place and the first in continental Europe: [[Wallonia]] (French speaking southern Belgium) was the first region to follow the British model successfully. Starting in the middle of the 1820s, and especially after Belgium became an independent nation in 1830, numerous works comprising coke blast furnaces as well as puddling and rolling mills were built in the coal mining areas around [[Liège]] and [[Charleroi]]. The leader was a transplanted Englishman [[John Cockerill (industrialist)|John Cockerill]]. His factories at [[Seraing]] integrated all stages of production, from engineering to the supply of raw materials, as early as 1825.&lt;ref name="publishing"/&gt;

Wallonia exemplified the radical evolution of industrial expansion. Thanks to coal (the French word "houille" was coined in Wallonia),&lt;ref name="language"/&gt; the region geared up to become the 2nd industrial power in the world after Britain. But it is also pointed out by many researchers, with its ''[[Sillon industriel]]'', 'Especially in the [[Haine]], [[Sambre]] and [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]] valleys, between the [[Borinage]] and [[Liège]], [...] there was a huge industrial development based on coal-mining and iron-making...'.&lt;ref name="ugent"/&gt; Philippe Raxhon wrote about the period after 1830: "It was not propaganda but a reality the Walloon regions were becoming the second industrial power all over the world after Britain."&lt;ref name="philippe"/&gt; "The sole industrial centre outside the collieries and blast furnaces of Walloon was the old cloth making town of [[Ghent]]."&lt;ref name="erih"/&gt; Michel De Coster, Professor at the [[University of Liège|Université de Liège]] wrote also: "The historians and the economists say that Belgium was the second industrial power of the world, in proportion to its population and its territory [...] But this rank is the one of Wallonia where the coal-mines, the blast furnaces, the iron and zinc factories, the wool industry, the glass industry, the weapons industry... were concentrated." &lt;ref name="linguistiques"/&gt;

=====Demographic effects=====
Wallonia was also the birthplace of a strong Socialist party and strong trade-unions in a particular sociological landscape. At the left, the ''Sillon industriel'', which runs from [[Mons]] in the west, to [[Verviers]] in the east (except part of North Flanders, in another period of the industrial revolution, after 1920). Even if Belgium is the second industrial country after Britain, the effect of the industrial revolution there was very different. In 'Breaking stereotypes', Muriel Neven and Isabelle Devious say:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The industrial revolution changed a mainly rural society into an urban one, but with a strong contrast between northern and southern Belgium. During the [[Middle Ages]] and the Early Modern Period, Flanders was characterised by the presence of large urban centres [...] at the beginning of the nineteenth century this region (Flanders), with an urbanisation degree of more than 30 per cent, remained one of the most urbanised in the world. By comparison, this proportion reached only 17 per cent in Wallonia, barely 10 per cent in most West European countries, 16 per cent in France and 25 per cent in Britain. Nineteenth century industrialisation did not affect the traditional urban infrastructure, except in [[Ghent]] [...] Also, in [[Wallonia]] the traditional urban network was largely unaffected by the industrialisation process, even though the proportion of city-dwellers rose from 17 to 45 per cent between 1831 and 1910. Especially in the [[Haine]], [[Sambre]] and [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]] valleys, between the [[Borinage]] and [[Liège]], where there was a huge industrial development based on coal-mining and iron-making, urbanisation was fast. During these eighty years the number of municipalities with more than 5,000 inhabitants increased from only 21 to more than one hundred, concentrating nearly half of the Walloon population in this region. Nevertheless, industrialisation remained quite traditional in the sense that it did not lead to the growth of modern and large urban centres, but to a conurbation of industrial villages and towns developed around a coal-mine or a factory. Communication routes between these small centres only became populated later and created a much less dense urban morphology than, for instance, the area around Liège where the old town was there to direct migratory flows.&lt;ref name="stereotypes"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====France====
{{main|Economic history of France}}The industrial revolution in France followed a particular course as it did not correspond to the main model followed by other countries. Notably, most French historians argue France did not go through a clear ''take-off''.&lt;ref name="marczewski" /&gt; Instead, France's economic growth and industrialisation process was slow and steady through the 18th and 19th centuries. However, some stages were identified by Maurice Lévy-Leboyer:
* French Revolution and Napoleonic wars (1789–1815),
* industrialisation, along with Britain (1815–1860),
* economic slowdown (1860–1905),
* renewal of the growth after 1905.

====Germany====
{{main|Economic history of Germany}}

Based on its leadership in chemical research in the universities and industrial laboratories, Germany, which was unified in 1871, became dominant in the world's chemical industry in the late 19th century. At first the production of dyes based on [[aniline]] was critical.&lt;ref name=Haber&gt;{{harvnb|Haber|1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany's political disunity – with three dozen states – and a pervasive conservatism made it difficult to build railways in the 1830s. However, by the 1840s, trunk lines linked the major cities; each German state was responsible for the lines within its own borders. Lacking a technological base at first, the Germans imported their engineering and hardware from Britain, but quickly learned the skills needed to operate and expand the railways. In many cities, the new railway shops were the centres of technological awareness and training, so that by 1850, Germany was self-sufficient in meeting the demands of railroad construction, and the railways were a major impetus for the growth of the new steel industry. Observers found that even as late as 1890, their engineering was inferior to Britain's. However, German unification in 1870 stimulated consolidation, nationalisation into state-owned companies, and further rapid growth. Unlike the situation in France, the goal was support of industrialisation, and so heavy lines crisscrossed the Ruhr and other industrial districts, and provided good connections to the major ports of Hamburg and Bremen. By 1880, Germany had 9,400 locomotives pulling 43,000 passengers and 30,000 tons of freight, and pulled ahead of France&lt;ref&gt;Allan Mitchell, ''Great Train Race: Railways and the Franco-German Rivalry, 1815–1914'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sweden====
{{Main|Economic history of Sweden}}
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}

During the period 1790–1815 Sweden experienced two parallel economic movements: an ''agricultural revolution'' with larger agricultural estates, new crops and farming tools and a commercialisation of farming, and a ''protoindustrialisation'', with small industries being established in the countryside and with workers switching between agricultural work in summer and industrial production in winter. This led to economic growth benefiting large sections of the population and leading up to a ''consumption revolution'' starting in the 1820s.

During 1815–1850 the protoindustries developed into more specialised and larger industries. This period witnessed increasing regional specialisation with mining in [[Bergslagen]], textile mills in Sjuhäradsbygden and forestry in [[Norrland]]. Several important institutional changes took place in this period, such as free and mandatory schooling introduced 1842 (as first country in the world), the abolition of the national monopoly on trade in handicrafts in 1846, and a stock company law in 1848.

During 1850–1890, Sweden experienced a veritable explosion in export, dominated by crops, wood and steel. Sweden abolished most tariffs and other barriers to free trade in the 1850s and joined the gold standard in 1873.

During 1890–1930, Sweden experienced the second industrial revolution. New industries developed with their focus on the domestic market: mechanical engineering, power utilities, [[papermaking]] and textile.

===Japan===
{{Main|Meiji Restoration|Economic history of Japan}}

The industrial revolution began about 1870 as [[Meiji period]] leaders decided to catch up with the West. The government built railroads, improved roads, and inaugurated a land reform programme to prepare the country for further development. It inaugurated a new Western-based education system for all young people, sent thousands of students to the United States and Europe, and hired more than 3,000 Westerners to teach modern science, mathematics, technology, and foreign languages in Japan ([[Foreign government advisors in Meiji Japan]]).

In 1871, a group of Japanese politicians known as the [[Iwakura Mission]] toured Europe and the United States to learn western ways. The result was a deliberate state-led industrialisation policy to enable Japan to quickly catch up. The [[Bank of Japan]], founded in 1882,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=https://www.boj.or.jp/en/about/outline/history/index.htm/|website=Bank of Japan|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; used taxes to fund model steel and textile factories. Education was expanded and Japanese students were sent to study in the west.

Modern industry first appeared in textiles, including cotton and especially silk, which was based in home workshops in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;G.C. Allen, ''Short Economic History of Modern Japan'' (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

Important American technological contributions during the period of the Industrial Revolution were the [[cotton gin]] and the development of a system for making [[interchangeable parts]], the latter aided by the development of the [[milling (machining)|milling machine]] in the US.  The development of machine tools and the system of interchangeable parts were the basis for the rise of the US as the world's leading industrial nation in the late 19th century.

[[Oliver Evans]] invented an automated flour mill in the mid-1780s that used [[process control|control mechanisms]] and conveyors so that no labour was needed from the time grain was loaded into the elevator buckets until flour was discharged into a wagon.  This is considered to be the first modern [[Bulk material handling|materials handling system]] an important advance in the progress toward [[mass production]].&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984"/&gt;

The United States originally used horse-powered machinery for small scale applications such as grain milling, but eventually switched to water power after textile factories began being built in the 1790s. As a result, industrialisation was concentrated in [[New England]] and the  [[Northeastern United States]], which has fast-moving rivers. The newer water-powered production lines proved more economical than horse-drawn production. In the late 19th century steam-powered manufacturing overtook water-powered manufacturing, allowing the industry to spread to the Midwest.

[[Thomas Somers]] and the [[Cabot Brothers]] founded the [[Beverly Cotton Manufactory]] in 1787, the first cotton mill in America, the largest cotton mill of its era,&lt;ref name="manufacturers"/&gt; and a significant milestone in the research and development of cotton mills in the future. This mill was designed to use horse power, but the operators quickly learned that the horse-drawn platform was economically unstable, and had economic losses for years. Despite the losses, the Manufactory served as a playground of innovation, both in turning a large amount of cotton, but also developing the water-powered milling structure used in Slater's Mill.&lt;ref name="publication"/&gt;

In 1793, [[Samuel Slater]] (1768–1835) founded the [[Slater Mill]] at [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]]. He had learned of the new textile technologies as a boy apprentice in [[Derbyshire]], England, and defied laws against the emigration of skilled workers by leaving for New York in 1789, hoping to make money with his knowledge. After founding Slater's Mill, he went on to own 13 textile mills.&lt;ref name="britannica8"/&gt; [[Daniel Day (manufacturer)|Daniel Day]] established a wool carding mill in the [[Blackstone Valley]] at [[Uxbridge, Massachusetts]] in 1809, the third woollen mill established in the US (The first was in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], and the second at [[Watertown, Massachusetts]].) The [[John Chafee|John H. Chafee]] [[Blackstone Valley|Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor]] retraces the history of "America's Hardest-Working River', the Blackstone. The [[Blackstone River]] and its tributaries, which cover more than {{convert|45|mi|km}} from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] to [[Providence, Rhode Island]], was the birthplace of America's Industrial Revolution. At its peak over 1100 mills operated in this valley, including Slater's mill, and with it the earliest beginnings of America's Industrial and Technological Development.

[[Francis Cabot Lowell (businessman)|Merchant Francis Cabot Lowell]] from [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]] memorised the design of textile machines on his tour of British factories in 1810. Realising that the [[War of 1812]] had ruined his import business but that a demand for domestic finished cloth was emerging in America, on his return to the United States, he set up the [[Boston Manufacturing Company]]. Lowell and his partners built America's second cotton-to-cloth textile mill at [[Waltham, Massachusetts]], second to the [[Beverly Cotton Manufactory]]. After his death in 1817, his associates built America's first planned factory town, which they named after him. This enterprise was capitalised in a [[Initial public offering|public stock offering]], one of the first uses of it in the United States. [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], using {{convert|5.6|mi|km}} of canals and 10,000 horsepower delivered by the [[Merrimack River]], is considered by some as a major contributor to the success of the American Industrial Revolution. The short-lived utopia-like [[Waltham-Lowell system]] was formed, as a direct response to the poor working conditions in Britain. However, by 1850, especially following the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Potato Famine]], the system had been replaced by poor immigrant labour.

A major U.S. contribution to industrialization was the development of techniques to make [[interchangeable parts]] from metal.  Precision metal machining techniques were developed by the U.S. Department of War to make interchangeable parts for small firearms.  The development work took place at the Federal Arsenals at Springfield Armory and Harpers Ferry Armory.  Techniques for precision machining using machine tools included using fixtures to hold the parts in proper position, jigs to guide the cutting tools and precision blocks and gauges to measure the accuracy.  The [[milling machine]], a fundamental machine tool, is believed to have been invented by [[Eli Whitney]], who was a government contractor who built firearms as part of this program.  Another important invention was the Blanchard lathe, invented by [[Thomas Blanchard (inventor)|Thomas Blanchard]].  The Blanchard lathe, or pattern tracing lathe, was actually a shaper that could produce copies of wooden gun stocks.  The use of machinery and the techniques for producing standardized and interchangeable parts became known as the [[American system of manufacturing]].&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984"/&gt;

Precision manufacturing techniques made it possible to build machines that mechanized the shoe industry.&lt;ref name = "Thomson 1989"&gt;{{cite book

The industrialisation of the watch industry started 1854 also in Waltham, Massachusetts, at the [[Waltham Watch Company]], with the development of machine tools, gauges and assembling methods adapted to the micro precision required for watches.

==Second Industrial Revolution==
{{Main|Second Industrial Revolution}}
[[File:Hartmann Maschinenhalle 1868 (01).jpg|thumb|[[Sächsische Maschinenfabrik]] in [[Chemnitz]], Germany, 1868]]
&lt;!--The industries created by the original innovations of the Industrial Revolution were mature and their markets saturated by the late 1830s, resulting in an economic downturn at that time, followed by a long period of slow growth.--&gt;    
[[Steel]] is often cited as the first of several new areas for industrial mass-production, which are said to characterise a "Second Industrial Revolution", beginning around 1850, although a method for mass manufacture of [[steel]] was not invented until the 1860s, when [[Henry Bessemer|Sir Henry Bessemer]] invented a new furnace which could convert molten [[pig iron]] into steel in large quantities. However, it only became widely available in the 1870s after the process was modified to produce more uniform quality.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Men, Machines and Modern Times"/&gt;  Bessemer steel was being displaced by the [[open hearth furnace]] near the end of the 19th century.

This Second Industrial Revolution gradually grew to include chemicals, mainly the [[chemical industry|chemical industries]], [[petroleum]] (refining and distribution), and, in the 20th century, the [[automotive industry]], and was marked by a transition of technological leadership from Britain to the United States and Germany.

The increasing availability of economical petroleum products also reduced the importance of coal and further widened the potential for industrialisation.

A new revolution began with electricity and [[electrification]] in the [[Electrical power industry|electrical industries]]. The introduction of [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]] generation in the [[Alps]] enabled the rapid industrialisation of coal-deprived northern Italy, beginning in the 1890s.

By the 1890s, industrialisation in these areas had created the first giant industrial corporations with burgeoning global interests, as companies like [[U.S. Steel]], [[General Electric]], [[Standard Oil]] and [[Bayer|Bayer AG]] joined the railroad and ship companies on the world's [[stock market]]s.

==Causes==
[[File:Historic world GDP per capita.svg|upright=1.35|thumb|Regional [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] per capita changed very little for most of human history before the Industrial Revolution.]]
The causes of the Industrial Revolution were complicated and remain a topic for debate, with some historians believing the Industrial Revolution was an outgrowth of social and institutional changes brought by the end of [[feudalism]] in [[Great Britain|Britain]] after the [[English Civil War]] in the 17th century.  The [[Enclosure]] movement and the [[British Agricultural Revolution]] made food production more efficient and less labour-intensive, forcing the farmers who could no longer be self-sufficient in agriculture into [[cottage industry]], for example [[weaving]], and in the longer term into the cities and the newly developed [[factory|factories]].&lt;ref name="The Origins of the Industrial Revolution in England"/&gt; The [[Colonialism|colonial expansion]] of the 17th century with the accompanying development of international trade, creation of [[financial market]]s and accumulation of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] are also cited as factors, as is the [[scientific revolution]] of the 17th century.&lt;ref name="msn"/&gt;   A change in marrying patterns to getting married later made people able to accumulate more human capital during their youth, thereby encouraging economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=13–16|isbn=9781107507180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1980s, it was universally believed by academic historians that technological innovation was the heart of the Industrial Revolution and the key enabling technology was the invention and improvement of the steam engine.&lt;ref name="industrial10"/&gt; However, recent research into the Marketing Era has challenged the traditional, supply-oriented interpretation of the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name="association"/&gt;

[[Lewis Mumford]] has proposed that the Industrial Revolution had its origins in the [[Early Middle Ages]], much earlier than most estimates.&lt;ref name="Technics &amp; Civilization"/&gt; He explains that the model for standardised [[mass production]] was the [[printing press]] and that "the archetypal model for the industrial era was the clock". He also cites the [[Monasticism|monastic]] emphasis on order and time-keeping, as well as the fact that [[medieval]] cities had at their centre a church with bell ringing at regular intervals as being necessary precursors to a greater synchronisation necessary for later, more physical, manifestations such as the steam engine.

The presence of a large domestic market should also be considered an important driver of the Industrial Revolution, particularly explaining why it occurred in Britain. In other nations, such as France, markets were split up by local regions, which often imposed tolls and [[tariff]]s on goods traded among them.&lt;ref name="google11"/&gt; Internal tariffs were abolished by [[Henry VIII of England]], they survived in Russia until 1753, 1789 in France and 1839 in Spain.

Governments' grant of limited [[monopoly|monopolies]] to inventors under a developing [[patent]] system (the [[Statute of Monopolies]] in 1623) is considered an influential factor. The effects of patents, both good and ill, on the development of industrialisation are clearly illustrated in the history of the steam engine, the key enabling technology. In return for publicly revealing the workings of an invention the patent system rewarded inventors such as James Watt by allowing them to monopolise the production of the first steam engines, thereby rewarding inventors and increasing the pace of technological development. However, monopolies bring with them their own inefficiencies which may counterbalance, or even overbalance, the beneficial effects of publicising ingenuity and rewarding inventors.&lt;ref name="industrialisation"/&gt; Watt's monopoly prevented other inventors, such as [[Richard Trevithick]], [[William Murdoch]],  or [[Jonathan Hornblower]], whom Boulton and Watt sued, from introducing improved steam engines, thereby retarding the spread of steam power.&lt;ref name="dklevine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mott-smith"/&gt;

One question of active interest to historians is why the Industrial Revolution occurred in Europe and not in other parts of the world in the 18th century, particularly China, [[Indian subcontinent|India]], and the Middle East (which pioneered in shipbuilding, textile production, water mills, and much more in the period between 750 and 1100&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Lever of Riches: Technological Creativity and Economic Progress|last=Mokyr|first=Joel|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0195074772|location=New York|pages=40–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;), or at other times like in [[Classical antiquity|Classical Antiquity]]&lt;ref name="j-bradford-delong"/&gt; or the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="historyguide"/&gt; A recent account argued that Europeans have been characterized for thousands of years by a freedom-loving culture originating from the aristocratic societies of early Indo-European invaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Uniqueness of Western Civilization|last=Duchesne|first=Ricardo|publisher=Brill|year=2011|isbn=978-9004232761|location=Leiden}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many historians, however, have challenged this explanation as being not only Eurocentric, but also ignoring historical context. In fact, before the Industrial Revolution, "there existed something of a global economic parity between the most advanced regions in the world economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vries|first=Pier|date=2001|title=Are Coal and Colonies Really Crucial?|url=|journal=Journal of World History|volume=2|pages=411|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These historians have suggested a number of other factors, including education, technological changes&lt;ref name="google12"/&gt; (see [[scientific revolution|Scientific Revolution]] in Europe), "modern" government, "modern" work attitudes, ecology, and culture.&lt;ref name="The Industrial Revolution – Causes"/&gt;

China was the world's most technologically advanced country for many centuries; however, China stagnated economically and technologically and was surpassed by Western Europe before the Age of Exploration, by which time China banned imports and denied entry to foreigners. China was also a totalitarian society.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern estimates of per capita income in Western Europe in the late 18th century are of roughly 1,500 dollars in [[purchasing power parity]] (and Britain had a [[per capita income]] of nearly 2,000 dollars&lt;ref name="iisg"/&gt;) whereas China, by comparison, had only 450 dollars.

Historians such as [[David Landes]] and [[Max Weber]] credit the different belief systems in Asia and Europe with dictating where the revolution occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= David S. Landes|date=1969|title= The Unbound Prometheus|publisher= Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|isbn= 978-0-521-09418-4|pages=20–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The religion and beliefs of Europe were largely products of [[Judeo-Christian|Judaeo-Christianity]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] thought. Conversely, Chinese society was founded on men like [[Confucius]], [[Mencius]], [[Han Fei]]zi ([[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]]), [[Laozi|Lao Tzu]] ([[Taoism]]), and [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] ([[Buddhism]]), resulting in very different worldviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Merson|1990|pp=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors include the considerable distance of China's coal deposits, though large, from its cities as well as the then unnavigable [[Yellow River]] that connects these deposits to the sea.&lt;ref name="professor"/&gt;

Regarding India, the Marxist historian [[Rajani Palme Dutt]] said: "The capital to finance the Industrial Revolution in India instead went into financing the Industrial Revolution in Britain."&lt;ref name="india_resource"/&gt; In contrast to China, India was split up into many competing kingdoms after the decline of the [[Mughal Empire]], with the major ones in its aftermath including the [[Maratha]]s, [[Sikh]]s, [[Bengal Subah]], and [[Kingdom of Mysore]]. In addition, the economy was highly dependent on two sectors – agriculture of subsistence and cotton, and there appears to have been little technical innovation. It is believed that the vast amounts of wealth were largely stored away in palace treasuries by totalitarian monarchs prior to the British take over.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Economic historian [[Joel Mokyr]] has argued that political fragmentation (the presence of a large number of European states) made it possible for heterodox ideas to thrive, as entrepreneurs, innovators, ideologues and heretics could easily flee to a neighboring state in the event that the one state would try to suppress their ideas and activities. This is what set Europe apart from the technologically advanced, large unitary empires such as China and India by providing "an insurance against economic and technological stagnation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The European Miracle: Environments, Economies and Geopolitics in the History of Europe and Asia|last=Jones|first=Eric|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1981|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; China had both a printing press and movable type, and India had similar levels scientific and technological achievement as Europe in 1700, yet the Industrial Revolution would occur in Europe, not China or India. In Europe, political fragmentation was coupled with an "integrated market for ideas" where Europe's intellectuals used the lingua franca of Latin, had a shared intellectual basis in Europe's classical heritage and the pan-European institution of the [[Republic of Letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10835.html|title=Mokyr, J.: A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy.

In addition, Europe's monarchs desperately needed revenue, pushing them into alliances with their merchant classes. Small groups of merchants were granted monopolies and tax-collecting responsibilities in exchange for payments to the state.

===Causes in Britain===
[[File:graph rel share world manuf 1750 1900 02.png|upright=1.35|thumb|As the Industrial Revolution developed British manufactured output surged ahead of other economies.]]

Great Britain provided the legal and cultural foundations that enabled [[entrepreneur]]s to pioneer the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Hoppit, "The Nation, the State, and the First Industrial Revolution," ''Journal of British Studies'' (April 2011) 50#2 pp.&amp;nbsp;307–31&lt;/ref&gt;  Key factors fostering this environment were: (1) The period of peace and stability which followed the unification of England and Scotland; (2) no trade barriers between England and Scotland; (3) the rule of law (enforcing property rights and respecting the sanctity of contracts); (4) a straightforward legal system that allowed the formation of joint-stock companies (corporations); (5) absence of tolls, which had largely disappeared from Britain by the 15th century, but were an extreme burden on goods elsewhere in the world, and (6) a free market (capitalism).&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;
{{Quote box|width=24%|align=left|quote="An unprecedented explosion of new ideas, and new technological inventions, transformed our use of energy, creating an increasingly industrial and urbanised country. Roads, railways and canals were built. Great cities appeared. Scores of factories and mills sprang up. Our landscape would never be the same again. It was a revolution that transformed not only the country, but the world itself." |source = – British historian [[Jeremy Black (historian)|Jeremy Black]] on the BBC's ''Why the Industrial Revolution Happened Here''.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;{{cite news|title=Why the Industrial Revolution Happened Here|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pz9d6|publisher=BBC|date=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Geographical and natural resource advantages of Great Britain were the fact that it had extensive coastlines and many navigable rivers in an age where water was the easiest means of transportation and having the highest quality coal in Europe.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;{{rp|332}}

There were two main values that really drove the Industrial Revolution in Britain. These values were self-interest and an [[entrepreneurial]] spirit. Because of these interests, many industrial advances were made that resulted in a huge increase in personal wealth and a [[consumer]] revolution.&lt;ref name="Black"/&gt; These advancements also greatly benefitted the British society as a whole. Countries around the world started to recognise the changes and advancements in Britain and use them as an example to begin their own Industrial Revolutions.&lt;ref name="Kiely"&gt;Kiely, Ray (November 2011). "Industrialization and Development: A Comparative Analysis". UGL Press Limited: 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate about the start of the Industrial Revolution also concerns the massive lead that Great Britain had over other countries. Some have stressed the importance of natural or financial resources that Britain received from its many overseas [[British Empire#Colonization|colonies]] or that profits from the British [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]] between Africa and the Caribbean helped fuel industrial investment. However, it has been pointed out that slave trade and West Indian plantations provided only 5% of the British national income during the years of the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name="Was slavery the engine of economic growth? Digital History"/&gt; Even though slavery accounted for so little, Caribbean-based demand accounted for 12% of Britain's industrial output.&lt;ref name="The Industrial Revolution by Pat Hudson, pg. 198"/&gt;
[[File:William Bell Scott - Iron and Coal.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|[[William Bell Scott]] ''Iron and Coal'', 1855–60]]

Instead, the greater [[liberalisation]] of trade from a large merchant base may have allowed Britain to produce and use emerging scientific and technological developments more effectively than countries with stronger monarchies, particularly China and Russia. Britain emerged from the [[Napoleonic Wars]] as the only European nation not ravaged by financial plunder and economic collapse, and having the only merchant fleet of any useful size (European merchant fleets were destroyed during the war by the [[Royal Navy]]&lt;ref name="manufacturing"/&gt;). Britain's extensive exporting cottage industries also ensured markets were already available for many early forms of manufactured goods. The conflict resulted in most British warfare being conducted overseas, reducing the devastating effects of territorial conquest that affected much of Europe. This was further aided by Britain's geographical position – an island separated from the rest of mainland Europe.

Another theory is that Britain was able to succeed in the Industrial Revolution due to the availability of key resources it possessed. It had a dense population for its small geographical size. [[Enclosure]] of common land and the related agricultural revolution made a supply of this labour readily available. There was also a local coincidence of natural resources in the [[Northern England|North of England]], the [[English Midlands]], [[South Wales]] and the [[Scottish Lowlands]]. Local supplies of coal, iron, lead, copper, tin, limestone and water power, resulted in excellent conditions for the development and expansion of industry. Also, the damp, mild weather conditions of the North West of England provided ideal conditions for the spinning of cotton, providing a natural starting point for the birth of the textiles industry.

The stable political situation in Britain from around 1688 following the [[Glorious Revolution]], and British society's greater receptiveness to change (compared with other European countries) can also be said to be factors favouring the Industrial Revolution. Peasant resistance to industrialisation was largely eliminated by the Enclosure movement, and the landed upper classes developed commercial interests that made them pioneers in removing obstacles to the growth of capitalism.&lt;ref name="dictatorship"/&gt; (This point is also made in [[Hilaire Belloc]]'s ''[[The Servile State]]''.)

The French philosopher [[Voltaire]] wrote about capitalism and religious tolerance in his book on English society, ''[[Letters on the English]]'' (1733), noting why England at that time was more prosperous in comparison to the country's less religiously tolerant European neighbours. "Take a view of the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange in London]], a place more venerable than many courts of justice, where the representatives of all nations meet for the benefit of mankind. There the Jew, the Mahometan [Muslim], and the Christian transact together, as though they all professed the same religion, and give the name of infidel to none but bankrupts. There the Presbyterian confides in the Anabaptist, and the Churchman depends on the Quaker's word. If one religion only were allowed in England, the Government would very possibly become arbitrary; if there were but two, the people would cut one another's throats; but as there are such a multitude, they all live happy and in peace."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/34/2/6.html|title=Letter VI – On the Presbyterians.

Britain's population grew 280% 1550–1820, while the rest of Western Europe grew 50–80%. Seventy percent of European urbanisation happened in Britain 1750–1800. By 1800, only the Netherlands was more urbanised than Britain. This was only possible because coal, coke, imported cotton, brick and slate had replaced wood, charcoal, flax, peat and thatch. The latter compete with land grown to feed people while mined materials do not. Yet more land would be freed when chemical fertilisers replaced manure and horse's work was mechanised. A workhorse needs {{convert|3|to|5|acres|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} for fodder while even early steam engines produced four times more mechanical energy.

In 1700, 5/6 of coal mined worldwide was in Britain, while the Netherlands had none; so despite having Europe's best transport, most urbanised, well paid, literate people and lowest taxes, it failed to industrialise. In the 18th century, it was the only European country whose cities and population shrank. Without coal, Britain would have run out of suitable river sites for mills by the 1830s.&lt;ref name="continuity"/&gt;

Economic historian [[Robert C. Allen|Robert Allen]] has argued that high wages, cheap capital and very cheap energy in Britain made it the ideal place for the industrial revolution to occur.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crafts|first=Nicholas|date=2011-04-01|title=Explaining the first Industrial Revolution: two views|url=https://academic.oup.com/ereh/article-abstract/15/1/153/512087/Explaining-the-first-Industrial-Revolution-two|journal=European Review of Economic History|volume=15|issue=1|pages=153–168|doi=10.1017/S1361491610000201|issn=1361-4916}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors made it vastly more profitable to invest in research and development, and to put technology to use in Britain than other societies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, two 2018 studies in ''[[The Economic History Review]]'' showed that wages were not particularly high in the British [[Spinning wheel|spinning]] sector or the construction sector, casting doubt on Allen's explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Humphries|first=Jane|last2=Schneider|first2=Benjamin|date=2018-05-23|title=Spinning the industrial revolution|journal=The Economic History Review|language=en|doi=10.1111/ehr.12693|issn=0013-0117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephenson|first=Judy Z.|date=2017-05-13|title='Real' wages?

===Transfer of knowledge===
[[File:Wright of Derby, The Orrery.jpg|thumb|[[A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery]] (ca. 1766). Informal philosophical societies spread scientific advances]]
Knowledge of innovation was spread by several means. Workers who were trained in the technique might move to another employer or might be poached. A common method was for someone to make a study tour, gathering information where he could. During the whole of the Industrial Revolution and for the century before, all European countries and America engaged in study-touring; some nations, like Sweden and France, even trained civil servants or technicians to undertake it as a matter of state policy. In other countries, notably Britain and America, this practice was carried out by individual manufacturers eager to improve their own methods. Study tours were common then, as now, as was the keeping of travel diaries. Records made by industrialists and technicians of the period are an incomparable source of information about their methods.

Another means for the spread of innovation was by the network of informal philosophical societies, like the [[Lunar Society of Birmingham]], in which members met to discuss 'natural philosophy' (''i.e.'' science) and often its application to manufacturing. The Lunar Society flourished from 1765 to 1809, and it has been said of them, "They were, if you like, the revolutionary committee of that most far reaching of all the eighteenth century revolutions, the Industrial Revolution".&lt;ref name="archive"/&gt; Other such societies published volumes of proceedings and transactions. For example, the London-based [[Royal Society of Arts]] published an illustrated volume of new inventions, as well as papers about them in its annual ''Transactions''.

There were publications describing technology. [[Encyclopedia|Encyclopaedias]] such as [[John Harris (writer)|Harris]]'s ''[[Lexicon Technicum]]'' (1704) and [[Abraham Rees]]'s ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'' (1802–1819) contain much of value. ''Cyclopaedia'' contains an enormous amount of information about the science and technology of the first half of the Industrial Revolution, very well illustrated by fine engravings. Foreign printed sources such as the ''[[Descriptions des Arts et Métiers]]'' and Diderot's ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' explained foreign methods with fine engraved plates.

Periodical publications about manufacturing and technology began to appear in the last decade of the 18th century, and many regularly included notice of the latest patents. Foreign periodicals, such as the ''Annales des Mines'', published accounts of travels made by French engineers who observed British methods on study tours.

Another theory is that the British advance was due to the presence of an [[entrepreneur]]ial class which believed in progress, technology and hard work.&lt;ref name="Capital and Innovation: How Britain Became the First Industrial Nation"/&gt; The existence of this class is often linked to the [[Protestant work ethic]] (see [[Max Weber]]) and the particular status of the [[Baptists]] and the dissenting Protestant sects, such as the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]] that had flourished with the [[English Civil War]]. Reinforcement of confidence in the rule of law, which followed establishment of the prototype of constitutional monarchy in Britain in the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, and the emergence of a stable financial market there based on the management of the [[Government debt|national debt]] by the [[Bank of England]], contributed to the capacity for, and interest in, private financial investment in industrial ventures.

[[English Dissenters|Dissenters]] found themselves barred or discouraged from almost all public offices, as well as education at England's [[Oxbridge|only two universities]] at the time (although dissenters were still free to study at Scotland's [[Ancient universities of Scotland|four universities]]). When the restoration of the monarchy took place and membership in the official [[Anglican Communion|Anglican Church]] became mandatory due to the [[Test Act]], they thereupon became active in banking, manufacturing and education. The [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], in particular, were very involved in education, by running Dissenting Academies, where, in contrast to the universities of Oxford and Cambridge and schools such as Eton and Harrow, much attention was given to mathematics and the sciences – areas of scholarship vital to the development of manufacturing technologies.

Historians sometimes consider this social factor to be extremely important, along with the nature of the national economies involved. While members of these sects were excluded from certain circles of the government, they were considered fellow Protestants, to a limited extent, by many in the [[middle class]], such as traditional financiers or other businessmen. Given this relative tolerance and the supply of capital, the natural outlet for the more enterprising members of these sects would be to seek new opportunities in the technologies created in the wake of the scientific revolution of the 17th century.

==Opposition from Romanticism==
{{Main|Romanticism}}
During the Industrial Revolution an intellectual and artistic hostility towards the new industrialisation developed, associated with the Romantic movement.  Romanticism revered the traditionalism of rural life and recoiled against the upheavals caused by industrialization, urbanization and the wretchedness of the working classes.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Löwy and Robert Sayre, eds., ''Romanticism against the Tide of Modernity'' (Duke University Press, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  Its major exponents in English included the artist and poet [[William Blake]] and poets [[William Wordsworth]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[John Keats]], [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]. The movement stressed the importance of "nature" in art and language, in contrast to "monstrous" machines and factories; the "Dark satanic mills" of Blake's poem "[[And did those feet in ancient time]]". [[Mary Shelley]]'s novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' reflected concerns that scientific progress might be two-edged. French Romanticism likewise was highly critical of industry.&lt;ref&gt;AJ George, ''The development of French romanticism: the impact of the industrial revolution on literature'' (1955)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="manufacturing"&gt;The Royal Navy itself may have contributed to Britain's industrial growth. Among the first complex industrial manufacturing processes to arise in Britain were those that produced material for British warships. For instance, the average warship of the period used roughly 1000 pulley fittings. With a fleet as large as the Royal Navy, and with these fittings needing to be replaced every 4 to 5 years, this created a great demand which encouraged industrial expansion. The industrial manufacture of rope can also be seen as a similar factor.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Irish potato famine Bridget O'Donnel.jpg|thumb|right|220px|An 1849 depiction of Bridget O'Donnell and her two children during the famine.]]
The '''legacy of the Great Famine''' in [[Ireland]] ({{lang-ga|'''An Gorta Mór'''}}&lt;ref&gt;The term has appeared in the titles of numerous books on the event, as demonstrated by [http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=%22Gorta+Mo%CC%81r%22&amp;=Search&amp;qt=results_page this search on WorldCat]&lt;/ref&gt; or ''An Drochshaol'', litt: ''The Bad Life'') followed a catastrophic period of Irish history between 1845 and 1852&lt;ref&gt;Kinealy (1995), xvi–ii.&lt;/ref&gt; during which time the population of Ireland was reduced by 20 to 25 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, This Great Calamity, Gill &amp; Macmillan (1994), {{ISBN|0-7171-4011-3}}, 357.&lt;/ref&gt;

The famine was a watershed in the [[history of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity'', p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Its effects permanently changed the island's demographic, political and cultural landscape. For both the native Irish and those in the resulting [[Irish diaspora|diaspora]], the famine entered [[folk memory]]&lt;ref&gt;The Famine that affected Ireland from 1845 to 1852 has become an integral part of folk legend. Kenealy, ''This Great Calamity'', p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt; and became a rallying point for various [[Irish nationalism|nationalist movements]]. Modern historians regard it as a dividing line in the Irish [[historical narrative]], referring to the preceding period of Irish history as "pre-Famine."

==Political and Cultural Impact of the Famine==

===In Ireland===
Political reaction resulting from the [[Great Irish Famine]] was muted, because of the extremely limited [[electoral franchise]] that existed at the time. While [[Politics of the Republic of Ireland|Irish politics]] in the 1820s to 1840s had been dominated by the [[Catholic Emancipation]] and "Repeal" movements under [[Daniel O'Connell]], it was not until the 1880s under [[Charles Stewart Parnell]], nearly forty years after the Famine, that a major [[Irish nationalist]] political movement, the [[Home Rule League]] (later known as the 'Parliamentary Party') appeared. Parnell was also instrumental in establishing the [[Irish Land League]], to achieve [[land reform]]. (The [[Independent Irish Party]], formed in June 1852, disintegrated within four years, but it was in major decline from 1853 when tenants benefited from a recovery in agricultural prices.)

Outside the mainstream, too, reaction was slow. The 1848 [[Young Ireland]] rebellion under [[Thomas Osborne Davis (Irish politician)|Thomas Davis]], though occurring at the start of the Famine, was hardly impacted upon ''by'' the Famine, as much as by the clash between the "constitutional" nationalism and [[Catholicism]] of O'Connell and the [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralist]] [[Irish republicanism|republicanism]] of Davis. Another rebellion would not occur again until the 1860s under the [[Fenians]]/[[Irish Republican Brotherhood]]. Historians have speculated that, such was the economic and social impact on Ireland, the nation was numbed into inaction for decades afterwards; in other words, that politics mattered less to people than survival after the traumatic experiences of the late 1840s and early 1850s.

Though its electorate was a small part of the population (as elsewhere in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]), those Irish privileged to vote continued until the mid-1880s to vote for the two major British political parties, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] and the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]], with more votes and seats going to the latter, even though it had been the party of government during the Famine. Because of the skewed franchise, a large body of voters continued to vote for [[Unionists (Ireland)|unionists]], who wished to maintain the Union that joined Britain and Ireland.

The British Royal Family avoided some censure, due to their perceived impotence in political affairs. Although some believed the myth that [[Queen Victoria]] (known in Ireland in later decades as the "Famine Queen") had only donated a miserly £5 to famine relief, in fact the sum was £2,000, the equivalent of £61,000 today, from her personal resources. She also was patron of a charity that fundraised. On instruction of the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] Victoria made what was largely seen as a propaganda visit in 1849. However, this visit was conducted under stringent security measures and was not free from protests or controversy. The celebrations associated with her visit  just after the famine were compared to "illuminating a graveyard" in a newspaper editorial at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Kinealy, Christine (2000), Hidden Famine: Hunger, Poverty and [[Sectarianism]] in [[Belfast]], p.184&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linguistic consequences===

It is estimated that one and a half million people died during the Famine and that a million emigrated between 1846 and 1851. A large proportion of these were Irish speakers, and the poorest districts, from which emigration continued to flow, were generally Irish-speaking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maureen Wall]], 'The Decline of the Irish Language,' p.87, in Ó Cuív, Brian (ed.) (1969), ''A View of the Irish Language'', Irish Stationery Office.&lt;/ref&gt; The Famine was not the only reason for the decline of the language (the general exclusion of Irish from public life and the influence of the English-speaking clergy and middle classes also played a part) but it was a conspicuous element.&lt;ref&gt;Breandán Ó Madagáin (1974, 1980), ''An Ghaeilge in Luimneach 1700–1900'', pp. 14–22, An Clóchomhar Tta, {{ISBN|0-7171-0685-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the creation of an Ireland which thought of itself as essentially English-speaking, though with a persistent and influential reaction in the form of organisations such as the [[Gaelic League]] and the growth of a network of urban [[Status of the Irish language|Irish-speaking activists]] from the late nineteenth century on.

In pre-Famine Ireland Irish was the language both of a rich folk culture and a strong literary tradition. The latter persisted in the form of [[Irish language]] manuscripts containing both prose and poetry: a single collection would give the reader access to a substantial part of the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Tomás de Bhaldraithe (ed.) (1970, 1973, 1976), ''Cín Lae Amhlaoibh'', p. xxvii, An Clóchomhar Tta, {{ISBN|0-7171-0512-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ó Madagáin, pp. 29–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Many such manuscripts were taken to America by emigrants in the 1840s and after.

The emigration of numerous Irish speakers to America as an immediate or long-term result of the Famine led to a movement there for the maintenance of the Irish language. This was marked in part by the foundation of Philo-Celtic Societies and the founding of the monthly journal ''An Gaodhal'' in 1881, the first such publication anywhere in which Irish was extensively used.&lt;ref&gt;Breandán Ó Buachalla, ' ''An Gaodhal'' i Meiriceá,' pp. 38–56, in Stiofán Ó hAnnracháin (ed.) (1979), ''Go Meiriceá Siar'', An Clóchomhar Tta.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.H.A. Williams, 'Ceol na hÉireann agus amhráin na ndaoine sna Stáit Aontaithe,' pp. 68–84, in Ó hAnnracháin (ed.) (1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irish emigrants abroad===

If the political elite in Ireland remained tolerant of British political parties and the monarchy, emigrants were not so. Many Irish emigrants to the United States quickly associated with separatist republican groups and organisations like the IRB. The political liberties and freedom of opportunity they encountered in the States confirmed for them the potential of an independent Ireland and often made them more passionate and optimistic than some of their brethren at home.

The Famine and its causes became a major platform for emigrant anger, as it was the main cause for most of them being emigrants in the first place. [[John Mitchel]], a journalist by trade (who had written for Thomas Davis's newspaper, [[The Nation - Irish newspaper|''The Nation'']] before leaving to set up his own paper, only to be arrested, tried for [[sedition]] and [[Penal transportation|transported]] to the [[penal colony]] of [[Van Diemen's Land]]) proved to be a superb campaigner against British rule in Ireland. Analysing the famine, he wrote:

{{cquote|The Almighty indeed sent the potato blight but the English created the famine... a million and half men, women and children were carefully, prudently and peacefully slain by the English government. They died of hunger in the midst of abundance which their own hands created.&lt;ref&gt;John Mitchel, ''The Last Conquest of Ireland''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;John Mitchel&lt;/small&gt;}}

Mitchel's commentary expressed the anger felt by many emigrants, who saw themselves as the dispossessed, forced from Ireland by a famine they blamed on British government policies. The famine became a constant issue with [[Irish American]]s, who to an extent unrivalled among other emigrant communities in the United States, remained emotionally attached to their native land. Leaders such as [[John Devoy]] in later decades came to play a major role in supporting Irish independence. It was no accident that the [[President of Dáil Éireann]], [[Éamon de Valera]] in 1920 chose to travel to the United States, not elsewhere, in his efforts to get the [[Irish Republic]] recognised and accepted, or that when [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] launched special bonds to fund the new Republic, many were sold to Irish Americans.

==Suggestions of genocide==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2016}}
A claim was made by a US professor of law, [[Francis A. Boyle]] that the Famine was [[genocide]] by the British against the Irish, meaning that the famine was part of a deliberate policy of planned extermination.  One US historian, [[James Mullin (American law librarian)|James Mullin]], insists that what happened can be described as genocide, sometimes accusing other historians, statisticians and researchers who state otherwise of pushing a British point of view, or of [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionism]], rewriting history to make excuses for [[British imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/68067 Americanchronicle.com]&lt;/ref&gt; However more US, British and Irish historians, such as Professors [[F.S.L. Lyons]], [[John A. Murphy]], [[R. F. Foster (historian)|Roy Foster]], and [[James S. Donnelly, Jr]], as well as historians [[Cecil Woodham-Smith]], [[Peter Gray (historian)|Peter Gray]], [[Ruth Dudley Edwards]] and [[Cormac Ó Gráda]] have denied claims of a deliberate policy of genocide. All historians generally agree that British policies during the Famine (particularly those applied by the ministry of [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]]) were misguided, ill-informed and counter-productive, and that had a similar crisis occurred in England instead of Ireland then the government's response would have been very different.

The famine killed one million Irish through hunger and related diseases such as [[cholera]]. A million others emigrated during the famine, with millions more following them in the following decades. The vast majority of these people were [[Roman Catholic]], traditionally less inclined towards loyalty to the Crown. However, while it could easily be said that the famine and its after-effects ended conclusively any chance of Ireland ever being a military or economic threat to Britain again, it should be also noted that the famine's long term demographic effects were less the result of deaths from starvation (which, as with most famines, affected the old, the very young and the sick disproportionately) and more the result of emigration (which primarily affected the young population of reproductive age).

The historical evidence suggests that earlier Irish famines caused mortality of comparable magnitude to the famine of the 1840s. Some famines, in particular the [[Irish Famine (1740–41)|that of the early 1740s]], might have even killed a larger proportion of the Irish population compared to that of the mid-19th century. Nevertheless, after earlier famines the population recovered relatively quickly if only because most of the survivors did not have the resources to emigrate. By comparison, during the first half of the nineteenth century the real cost of a transatlantic voyage would fall to a point that by the 1840s even the poorest people could secure passage, albeit under wretched conditions. It seems virtually certain that economic factors alone would have caused considerable emigration from Ireland even without mass starvation. A comparison between the historical populations of [[Demographics of the Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Demographic history of Scotland|Scotland]] proves useful with regards to this point - even though Scotland has not experienced a catastrophic famine in the past two centuries, nevertheless, it has experienced steady emigration over that time, albeit on a slower and steadier pace compared to Ireland. As a result, while the population of Scotland surpassed that of Ireland around the beginning of the 20th century, by the end of the century the population of Ireland once again exceeded that of Scotland.

==Legacy of the Famine today==

Ireland commemorated the 150th anniversary of the Great Famine in the 1990s. It was a contrast, in many ways, with the 100th anniversary in the 1940s. Then, only a few commemorations were held—the most significant of which was a commissioned volume of Famine history edited by [[R. Dudley Edwards]] and [[T. Desmond Williams]] (though not published until 1956), and the 'Famine Survey' undertaken by the [[Irish Folklore Commission]] in 1945. The 1990s marked a significant shift in attitudes towards commemorating the Famine, as hundreds of events took place in Ireland and throughout the Irish diaspora, some of which received sponsorship from the [[National Famine Commemoration Committee]] based in the [[Department of the Taoiseach]], led by [[Teachta Dála|TD]] [[Avril Doyle]]. At the Great Famine Event held in [[Millstreet]], a statement from [[British Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] was read aloud, apologising for the failure of past British governments to adequately address the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Guardian]] ''Blair says sorry for Britain's 'failure' in the Irish famine'' 2 June 1997&lt;/ref&gt; A large amount of new famine studies were produced, many detailing for the first time local experiences. Historians re-examined all aspects of the Famine experience; from practical issues like the number of deaths and emigrants, to the long-term impact it had on society, sexual behaviour, land holdings, [[property rights]] and the entire Irish identity. In 2010 Britain failed to send a diplomatic representative to the opening of the National Famine Commemoration, while 14 other nations did.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/british-fail-to-attend-famine-ceremony-2182551.html Independent.ie]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Famine in song==
The Famine is also commemorated in song, both from the period and from modern times. Irish novelist and songwriter, [[Brendan Graham]] has written a number of novels and songs on '''An Gorta Mor – the Great Irish Famine'''. His book publishing deal with [[Harper Collins]] originated from a number of songs he had written about An Gorta Mor, resulting in the publication of his best selling 'documentary novel' of the Famine – '''The Whitest Flower''' (HarperCollins, London, Sydney, Toronto, 1998). The Sunday Times, Canberra called The Whitest Flower – 'An important addition to the Irish national story'. The Whitest Flower, with its song 'soundtrack', was a required text for Boston's MIT Women's Studies Course. Along with its sequel '''The Element of Fire''' (HarperCollins, 2001), The Whitest Flower was also listed as 'support fiction' for Ireland's Leaving Certificate, History syllabus.

"'''[[The Voice (Eimear Quinn song)|The Voice]]'''" written by [[Brendan Graham]] and performed by Eimear Quinn won the 1996 [[Eurovision Song Contest]] for Ireland. The lyrics refer to Ireland's troubled history and point clearly to Famine times in Ireland, ''I am The Voice of your hunger and pain''.

As well as entering the British Pop Charts, The Voice was one of the songs studied for the UK GCSE Music Syllabus, 1998. Eimear Quinn's version featured in the [[Pierce Brosnan]] movie – The Nephew, while the song found a new life in America with the recording and widespread PBS broadcasting of it as part of the group Celtic Woman's rise to prominence there.  Author and sociologist E. Moore Quinn in her book 'Irish American Folklore in New England', published in 2009, quotes the full lyric of The Voice.

'''"The Fairhaired Boy"''' – This song written by [[Brendan Graham]] was recorded by Cathy Jordan and [[Dervish]] on their 2003 album, 'Spirit'. Carmel Conway also recorded the song on her 2009 album 'This Beautiful Day'. It is also performed in the 'Cois Tine – Stories of Liam O' Flaherty' – by singer and violinist Fionnuala Howard. A song of emigration from Ireland during Famine times, The Fairhaired Boy tells of the sorrow of parting – 'Soon you'll in California be or Colorado bound'. In The Whitest Flower, Graham's heroine Ellen sings the song to Roberteen, a young neighbour from Ireland whom she finds dying in the lazaretto (fever shed) at Canada's Quarantine Island of Grosse Ile. The song is written in a traditional narrative style song form where there are no choruses, the hook of the song being contained in the last line of each stanza with the pull of the story being used to keep the listener's interest alive.

'''"Crucán na bPáiste"''' – 'the burial place of (unbaptised) children' – lies on a hilltop in Maamtrasna, Co.Mayo, overlooking Lough Nafooey, and Lough Mask in Ireland. It is a lament by a mother for a child she buries there during Aimsir an Drochshaoil ('The Time of the Bad Life' – the Famine). The song was written by Graham for Ellen Rua, one of the characters in his second novel,  '''The Brightest Day, The Darkest Night''', also published by Harper Collins. It has been recorded and performed by a number of artistes most notably [[Karen Matheson]] (as part of the Transatlantic Sessions), Cathy Jordan of Dervish and Eimear Quinn. Graham reveals the story of how the song came to be written in his Sunday Miscellany radio piece for RTÉ, called ''Effin' Songs'', recorded live in Ireland's National Concert Hall, with Eimear Quinn and the RTÉ Concert Orchestra and piper Neil Martin, following with the song itself.

''"Crucán na bPáiste had become a claw in my gut – and my pilgrimage. Over many months it inched out in me its cry...focal by focal...line by line...until I was set free and it had found its epiphany. I had learned to keep out of the way...let the song write itself. This, I suppose is the real answer to the question with which we started. The truly special songs write us...we don't write them; we don't find them...they find us"''.

Another of Graham's Famine songs, '''"Ochón an Gorta Mor / Lament of the Great Hunger"''', was commissioned by the Irish Government, as part of the Ceól Reoite (Frozen Music – after Goethe's 'Architecture is frozen music') Millennial Project. Fourteen Irish composers were asked to pick a monument of national significance and to write a piece of music/song which would release from it the music frozen within. Graham chose the Curvilinear Glasshouses at Dublin's National Botanic Gardens, constructed at the time of An Gorta Mor, by monies diverted from research to find a cure for the potato blight afflicting Ireland. The glasshouses looked down over the Gardens' 'vegetable patch', where the blight was first discovered in Ireland in August 1845. Graham has described the 'frozen music' locked within the architecture of the Curvilinear Glasshouses as 'a lament for a famished people'. A song for unaccompanied voice it has been recorded by Róisín Elsafty, on the Ceól Reoite album and as a 'hidden track' by Cathy Jordan on the Dervish album, Spirit  . The song was also performed by Nuala Ní Chanainn in the 2002 production of Aistir/Voyage by the Swiss- based, Cathy Sharp Dance Ensemble.

"'''[[You Raise Me Up]]'''" - It was in fact reading Graham's novel The Whitest Flower, that led Norwegian composer, [[Rolf Løvland|Rolf Lovland]] to contact Graham with a melody. This melody in turn inspired Graham to write the lyric -You Raise Me Up, which has been recorded by some 400 artists (including [[Westlife]], [[Josh Groban]], [[Brian Kennedy (singer)|Brian Kennedy]] and [[Secret Garden (duo)|Secret Garden]], [[Daniel O'Donnell]], [[Helene Fischer]], [[Il Divo]], [[Russell Watson]] and [[Paul Potts]]) and has become one of the most successful songs in popular music history.

[[Brendan Graham]] has also recently written a number of integrated song and narrative pieces including '''Writing the Famine in Fiction and Song''', for The National Famine Commemoration Week in Ireland, 2010. This was narrated by the author with songs performed by Cathy Jordan accompanied on piano by Feargal Murray.

In Quebec, 2011, his shorter narrative and song piece – '''From Famine to Freedom – Ireland to Grosse Ile''' – was performed by the [[Quebec Symphony Orchestra]] and soloist Méav Ní Mhaolchatha, with Graham's narration translated into French. It included a first performance with orchestra of The Whitest Flower, Graham's title song for the soundtrack to his book. In response to the view handed down at the time of Ireland's Famine that "The judgement of God…sent the calamity to teach the Irish a lesson, that calamity must not be too much mitigated" (Charles E. Trevelyan – Permanent Assistant Secretary at the British Treasury with prime responsibility for Famine relief in Ireland), Graham's song calls to task a vengeful God:-

In August 2012 Brendan Graham composed and presented '''From Famine to Freedom—Ireland to Australia''', a commemoration in word and song of those who suffered during An Gorta Mór–The Great Irish Famine–and of those who fled the Famine to establish a new life Australia. Graham wrote a new song called, '''"Orphan Girl"''', dedicated to the memory of the 4,112, mainly teenage Irish orphan girls, who were given a free passage to Australia from Workhouses in every county of Ireland between 1848 and 1850. Brendan Graham was joined by Australian singer-songwriter, '''[[Sarah Calderwood]]''' who unites classic with contemporary folk. She is the charismatic front woman of Australia's premier Celtic group, '''Sunas''', who released the ABC best-selling debut album ‘As Night Falls’. Graham and Calderwood were also joined on the day by the inspirational '''Australian Girls Choir''', who have previously performed for Nelson Mandela, Oprah Winfrey, Queen Elizabeth II and President Obama. The commemoration in words and song was a community day of celebration and remembering, especially for those who are descendants of these Irish Workhouse young women.For more information see www.irishfaminememorial.org

More recently in March 2013 '''The Possible Dreams Choir''' toured Victoria in Australia, singing '''"Orphan Girl"''' (sung by Fortunate and Nomcebo) and '''"You Raise Me Up"''' as part of their '''Voices for the Voiceless''' tour. Possible Dreams International, Inc is a non-profit organisation which partners with rural and remote communities in Swaziland, Southern Africa to empower families and individuals living with extreme poverty, malnutrition and endemic disease. So in Graham's "Famine in Song" lyrics, there resonates a global reach.

A famous modern song on the famine is "[[The Fields of Athenry]]", by [[Pete St. John]]. Written in three verses, it deals with a fictitious but realistic story of "Michael" being deported to [[Botany Bay]] for stealing corn to feed his starving family. Performed in folk, traditional and even reggae versions, it is often sung by supporters of [[Glasgow]]'s [[Celtic F.C.]], many of whom are of Irish descent. The song itself sums up the sense of despair, anger and bitterness of famine victims. The song was also covered by [[Boston]] [[punk rock]] band, the [[Dropkick Murphys]] on their 2003 ''[[Blackout (Dropkick Murphys album)|Blackout]]'' album.
[[File:Famine memorial.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Rowan Gillespie]]'s "Famine", in Ireland Park, [[Toronto]] [[Harbourfront (Toronto)|Harbourfront]]]]

[[Luka Bloom]]'s song 'Forgiveness' from his album Salty Heaven is sung from the point of view of an Irish Famine refugee who has relocated to Canada and who despite his suffering has chosen forgiveness over bitterness.

Luka Bloom's brother [[Christy Moore]] also has a song, written by Bloom but recorded by Moore, called 'The City of Chicago,' that chronicles the effects of the Famine and the subsequent mass emigration.

[[Pagan metal]] band [[Primordial (band)|Primordial]] also have a song about the Famine named "The Coffin Ships" on their 2005 album ''[[The Gathering Wilderness]]''.

Another related song is "Famine" by [[Sinéad O'Connor]], released on the [[Universal Mother]] album. The lyrics&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uhb.fr/langues/Cei/soconnor.htm UHB.fr] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011003814/http://www.uhb.fr/langues/cei/soconnor.htm |date=11 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasise the political aspect of the famine.

==Ireland and modern famine relief==

Ireland has been at the forefront of international famine relief.  In 1985 [[Bob Geldof]], Irish rock star and founder of [[Live Aid]], revealed that the people of Ireland had given more to his fundraising efforts per head of population than any other nation in the world. Irish NGOs ''[[Goal (charity)|Goal]]'', ''[[Concern (charity)|Concern]]'', ''[[Trócaire]]'' and ''[[Gorta]]'' play a central role in helping famine victims throughout Africa. In 2000, [[Bono]], lead singer with Irish band [[U2]], played a central role in campaigning for [[debt relief]] for African nations in the [[Jubilee 2000]] campaign. The Irish famine experience continues to influence many Irish people in their attitudes towards the [[developing world]] and famine victims everywhere.

In order to support amphibious operations during the [[Battle of Pisagua|landing in Pisagua]] by carrying significant quantities of cargo, and landing troops directly onto an unimproved shore, the Government built flat-bottomed landing craft, called ''Chalanas''. They transported 1,200 men in the first landing and took onboard 600 men in less than 2 hours for the second landing.&lt;ref name="Urrutia2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carlos Lpez Urrutia|title=Guerra Del Pacifico|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OVaQJp_t_jAC|accessdate=26 April 2013|date=30 June 2008|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-4357-1183-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|date=December 2017}}{{rp|40}}

{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2013}}
A '''millennium''' (plural '''millennia''' or '''millenniums''') is a period equal to [[1000 (number)|1000]] [[year]]s,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/millennium millennium]", ''Oxford Dictionaries'' (Oxford University Press, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; also called kiloyears. It derives from the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|mille}}'', thousand, and ''{{lang|la|annus}}'', year. It is often, but not always, related to a particular [[calendar|dating system]].

Sometimes, it is used specifically for periods of a thousand years that begin at the starting point (initial reference point) of the calendar in consideration (typically the year "1"), or in later years that are whole number multiples of a thousand years after it. The term can also refer to an interval of time beginning on any date. Frequently in the latter case (and sometimes also in the former) it may have religious or theological implications (see [[millenarianism]]).

==Counting years==
There are two methods of counting years: current years (the count begins at the epoch) and elapsed years (the count is of completed years since the epoch).

The original method of counting years was [[ordinal number|ordinal]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} whether ''1st year [[AD]]'' or [[regnal year|regnal]] ''10th year of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]]''. This ordinal numbering is still used in the names of the millennia and centuries, for example the ''1st millennium'' or the ''10th century'', and sometimes in the names of decades, e.g., ''1st decade of the 11th century''.

The main issues arise from the ''content'' of the various year ranges. Similar issues affect the ''contents'' of centuries. Decades are not subject to ambiguity, as they are named according to their leading numbers: the decade called the 1990s by its naming does not include 2000.

Those following ordinal year names naturally choose
* 2001–2100 (inclusive) as the current century
* 2001–3000 (inclusive) as the current millennium
Those who are influenced by the leading digit equally naturally choose
* 2000–2099 (inclusive) as the current century
* 2000–2999 (inclusive) as the current millennium

==Debate over millennium celebrations==
There are two viewpoints about how millennia should be thought of in practice. One viewpoint relies on the formal operation of the calendar, while the other appeals to [[Popular culture|popular culture]]. [[Stephen Jay Gould]] argued that the choice is arbitrary, and since the question revolves around rules made by people, rather than a natural phenomenon that is subject to experimental measurement, the matter cannot be resolved.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, Stephen Jay, ''Questioning the Millennium'' (New York: Harmony Books, 1997), part 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ISO 8601]], employed in [[ISO 8601 usage|a number of contexts]], uses the [[Astronomical year numbering|astronomical calendar]], in which year counting starts at 0. Thus, when using this calendar, the millennium starts at x000 and ends at x999. There was a popular debate leading up to the [[Millennium celebrations|celebrations of the year 2000]] as to whether the beginning of that year should be understood (and celebrated) as the beginning of a new millennium. Historically, there has been debate around the turn of previous decades, centuries, and millennia.

The issue is tied to the convention of using [[ordinal number]]s to count millennia (as in "the third millennium"), as opposed to "the two thousands", which is unambiguous as it does not depend on which year counting starts. The first convention is common in English speaking countries, but the latter is favored in for example Sweden (''tvåtusentalet'', which translates literally as the ''two thousands period'').

===Viewpoint 1: X001–Y000===
Those holding that the arrival of the new millennium should be celebrated in the transition from 2000 to 2001 (i.e., December 31, 2000 to January 1, 2001), argued that because the Gregorian calendar has no year zero, the millennia should be counted from 1 AD. Thus the first period of one thousand complete years runs from the beginning of 1 AD to the end of 1000 AD, and the beginning of the second millennium took place at the beginning of 1001.

[[Arthur C. Clarke]] gave this [[analogy]] (from a statement received by [[Reuters]]): "If the scale on your grocer's weighing machine began at 1 instead of 0, would you be happy when he claimed he'd sold you 10 kg of tea?" This statement illustrates the common confusion about the calendar.

If one counts from the beginning of AD 1 to the ending of AD 1000, one would have counted 1000&amp;nbsp;years. The next 1000&amp;nbsp;years (millennium) would begin on the first day of 1001. So the calendar has not 'cheated' anyone out of a year. Clarke made reference to this viewpoint in his book ''[[3001: The Final Odyssey]]'' referring to the Millennium Celebrations on December 31, 2000. In other words, the argument is based on the fact that the last year of the first two thousand years in the Gregorian calendar was 2000, not 1999.

===Viewpoint 2: X000–X999===
The "year 2000" has also been a popular phrase referring to an often [[utopia]]n future, or a year when stories in such a future were set, adding to its cultural significance. There was also media and public interest in the [[Y2K bug]]. People liked to compared their [[Odometer|odometer]] as a reason to celebrate the new millennium which goes from 1999 to 2000. Thus, the populist argument was that the new millennium should begin when the zeroes "rolled over" to 2000, i.e., the day after December 31, 1999. People&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hermetic.ch/cal_stud/newmill.htm "When Does the New Millennium Begin?"] January 1, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; felt that the change of the hundreds digit in the year number, and the zeros rolling over, created a sense that a new century had begun.

This is similar to the common demarcation of decades by their most significant digits, e.g., naming the period 1980 to 1989 as the 1980s or "the eighties". Similarly, it would be valid to celebrate the year 2000 as a cultural event in its own right, and name the period 2000 to 2999 would be "the 2000s". In other words, the time period between 1 and 999 (999 years only) would be called the "0s" and the period between 1000 and 1999 would be the "1000s".

===Popular approach===
The popular&lt;ref name=AP&gt;Associated Press, [http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jan/01/news/mn-7177 "Y2K It Wasn't, but It Was a Party"], ''Los Angeles Times'', January 1, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; approach was to treat the end of 1999 as the end of a millennium and to hold millennium celebrations at midnight between December 31, 1999 and January 1, 2000, as per viewpoint 2. The cultural and psychological significance of the events listed above combined to cause celebrations to be observed one year earlier than the formal Gregorian date.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; This does not establish that insistence on the formal Gregorian date is "incorrect", though some view it as pedantic.

Some event organisers hedged their bets by calling their 1999 celebrations things like "Click" referring to the [[odometer]]-like rolling over of the nines to zeros. A second approach was to adopt two different views on the millennium problem and celebrate the new millennium twice.

[[Stephen Jay Gould]], in his essay ''Dousing Diminutive Dennis' Debate (or DDDD = 2000)'' (''[[Dinosaur in a Haystack]]''), discussed the "high" versus "pop" culture interpretation of the transition. Gould noted that the high culture, strict construction had been the dominant viewpoint at the 20th century's beginning, but that the pop culture viewpoint dominated at its end. Gould also included comments on adjustments to the calendar, such as those by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] (the eponymous "Diminutive Dennis") and the timing of celebrations over different transitional periods. Further of his essays on this topic are collected in ''Questioning the Millennium: A Rationalist's Guide to a Precisely Arbitrary Countdown''.

'''Mu''' is the name of a suggested [[lost continent]] whose concept and name were proposed by 19th-century traveler and writer [[Augustus Le Plongeon]], who claimed that several ancient civilizations, such as those of [[Egypt]] and [[Mesoamerica]], were created by refugees from Mu — which he stated was located in the [[Atlantic ocean|Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref name="qmoo"&gt;{{cite book| title = Queen Móo &amp; The Egyptian Sphinx|first= Augustus|last=Le Plongeon| year = 1896| pages = 277 pages| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=x74RAAAAYAAJ| publisher = The Author}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was popularized and expanded by [[James Churchward]], who asserted that Mu was once located in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]].&lt;ref name="chlost26"/&gt;

The existence of Mu was already being disputed in Le Plongeon's time. Currently scientists dismiss the concept of Mu (and other alleged lost continents such as [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]]) as physically impossible, arguing that a continent can neither sink nor be destroyed in the short period of time required by this premise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Haugton|first=Brian | title = Hidden History| publisher = New Page Books| year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-56414-897-1| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fSbRZunGbF4C&amp;pg=PA59}} Page 60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="camp"&gt;{{cite book| author = De Camp, Lyon Sprague | title = Lost Continents: Atlantis Theme in History, Science and Literature| publisher = Dover Publications| origyear = 1954| year = 1971| isbn = 978-0-486-22668-2| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3YHwFivT-ykC&amp;pg=PA153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mu's existence is considered to have no factual basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Brennan|first=Louis A.| title=No Stone Unturned: An Almanac of North American Pre-history| publisher = Random House| year = 1959}} Page 228.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Witzel|first= Michael | title = Archaeological Fantasies| editor = Garrett G.

==History of the concept==

===Augustus Le Plongeon===
The mythical idea of Mu first appeared in the works of Augustus Le Plongeon (1825–1908), after his investigations of the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] ruins in [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]].&lt;ref name="qmoo"/&gt; He claimed that he had translated ancient Mayan writings which supposedly showed that the Maya civilization of the Yucatán was older than those of [[Greece]] and [[Egypt]], and told the story of an even older continent.

Le Plongeon actually got the name "Mu" from [[Charles Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg]], who in 1864 mistranslated what was then called the [[Troano Codex]] using the [[de Landa alphabet]].  Brasseur believed that a word which he read as ''Mu'' referred to a land which had been submerged by a catastrophe.&lt;ref&gt;John Sladek, ''The New Apocrypha'' (New York: Stein and day, 1974) 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt;  Le Plongeon then identified this lost land with [[Atlantis]], and turned it into a continent which had supposedly sunk into the Atlantic Ocean:

{{quote|In our journey westward across the Atlantic we shall pass in sight of that spot where once existed the pride and life of the ocean, the Land of Mu, which, at the epoch that we have been considering, had not yet been visited by the wrath of Human, that lord of volcanic fires to whose fury it afterward fell a victim. The description of that land given to [[Solon]] by [[Sonchis of Sais|Sonchis]], priest at [[Sais]]; its destruction by [[earthquake]]s, and submergence, recorded by [[Plato]] in his ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', have been told and retold so many times that it is useless to encumber these pages with a repetition of it.&lt;ref name="qmoo"/&gt;{{rp|ch. VI, p. 66}}}}

Le Plongeon claimed that the civilization of ancient Egypt was founded by Queen Moo, a refugee from the land's demise. Other refugees supposedly fled to [[Central America]] and became the Maya.&lt;ref name="camp"/&gt;

===James Churchward===
[[File:Lemuria mumap2.jpg|thumb|Churchward's map showing how he thought Mu refugees spread out after the cataclysm through South America, along the shores of Atlantis, and into Africa]]
Mu, as a lost Pacific Ocean continent, was later popularised by [[James Churchward]] (1851–1936) in a series of books, beginning with ''Lost Continent of Mu, the Motherland of Man'' (1926),&lt;ref name="chlost26"&gt;{{cite book | title = Lost Continent of Mu, the Motherland of Man |first= James|last=Churchward | year = 1926 | isbn = 0-7661-4680-4 | publisher = Kessinger Publishing | location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; re-edited later as ''The Lost Continent Mu'' (1931).&lt;ref name="chlost31"&gt;{{cite book |first= James|last=Churchward | title = The Lost Continent of Mu | publisher = Ives Washburn | location = New York | year = 1931}} Re-published by Adventures Unlimited Press (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Other popular books in the series are ''The Children of Mu'' (1931), and ''The Sacred Symbols of Mu'' (1933).

Churchward claimed that "more than fifty years ago", while he was a soldier in [[India]], he befriended a high-ranking temple priest who showed him a set of ancient "sunburnt" clay tablets, supposedly in a long lost "Naga-Maya language" which only two other people in India could read. Having mastered the language himself, Churchward found out that they originated from "the place where [man] first appeared—Mu". The 1931 edition states that "all matter of science in this work are based on translations of two sets of ancient tablets": the clay tablets he read in India, and a collection of 2,500 stone tablets that had been uncovered by [[William Niven]] in [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="chlost31"/&gt;{{rp|7}}

Churchward gave a vivid description of Mu as the home of an advanced civilization, the [[Naacal]], which flourished between 50,000 and 12,000 years ago, was dominated by a “white race",&lt;ref name="chlost31"/&gt;{{rp|48}} and was "superior in many respects to our own".&lt;ref name="chlost31"/&gt;{{rp|17}} At the time of its demise, about 12,000 years ago, Mu had 64,000,000 inhabitants and many large cities, and colonies on the other continents.

Churchward claimed that the landmass of Mu was located in the Pacific Ocean, and stretched east–west from the [[Marianas Islands|Marianas]] to [[Easter Island]], and north–south from [[Hawaii]] to [[Mangaia]]. He claimed that according to the [[creation myth]] he read in the Indian tablets, Mu had been lifted above sea level by the expansion of underground volcanic gases. Eventually Mu "was completely obliterated in almost a single night":&lt;ref name="chlost31"/&gt;{{rp|44}} after a series of earthquakes and [[volcanic eruption]]s, "the broken land fell into that great abyss of fire" and was covered by "fifty millions of square miles of water."&lt;ref name="chlost31"/&gt;{{rp|50}}

Churchward claimed that Mu was the common origin of the great civilizations of Egypt, Greece, Central America, India, Burma and others, including Easter Island, and was in particular the source of ancient [[megalithic]] architecture. As evidence for his claims, he pointed to symbols from throughout the world, in which he saw common themes of birds, the relation of the Earth and the sky, and especially the [[Sun]]. Churchward claims that the king of Mu was named Ra and he relates this to the Egyptian god of the sun, [[Ra]], and the [[Rapa Nui language|Rapa Nui]] word for Sun, ''ra’a'', which he incorrectly spells "''raa''."&lt;ref name="chlost31"/&gt;{{rp|48}} He claimed to have found symbols of the Sun in "Egypt, [[Babylonia]], [[Peru]] and all ancient lands and countries – it was a universal symbol."&lt;ref name="chlost31"/&gt;{{rp|138}}

Churchward attributed all megalithic art in [[Polynesia]] to the people of Mu. He claimed that symbols of the sun are found "depicted on stones of Polynesian ruins", such as the stone hats (''[[pukao]]'') on top of the giant ''[[moai]]'' statues of Easter Island.  Citing [[W.J. Johnson]], Churchward describes the cylindrical hats as "spheres" that "seem to show red in the distance", and asserts that they “represent the Sun as Ra.”&lt;ref name="chlost31"/&gt;{{rp|138}} He also incorrectly claimed that some of them are made of "red sandstone",&lt;ref name="chlost31"/&gt;{{rp|89}} which does not exist on the island. The platforms on which the statues rest (''ahu'') are described by Churchward as being "platform-like accumulations of cut and dressed stone", which were supposedly left in their current positions "awaiting shipment to some other part of the continent for the building of temples and palaces".&lt;ref name="chlost31"/&gt;{{rp|89}} He also cites the pillars "erected by the [[Māori people|Māori]] of [[New Zealand]]" as an example of this lost civilization's handiwork.&lt;ref name="chlost31"/&gt;{{rp|158}} In Churchward's view, the present-day Polynesians are not descendants of the dominant members of the lost civilization of Mu, responsible for these great works, but are instead descendants of survivors of the cataclysm that adopted "the first [[cannibalism]] and savagery" in the world.&lt;ref name="chlost31"/&gt;{{rp|54}}

[[Image:Yonaguni Ruins Scuba.jpg|thumb|Underwater structures claimed to be remnants of Mu, near [[Yonaguni]], [[Japan]]]]

===Modern claims===
James Bramwell and [[William Scott-Elliott]] claimed that the cataclysmic events on Mu began 800,000 years ago&lt;ref name="bram39"&gt;{{cite book | title = Lost Atlantis |first= James |last=Bramwell | year = 1939}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|194}} and went on until the last catastrophe, which occurred in precisely 9564 BC.&lt;ref name="bram39"/&gt;{{rp|195}}

In the 1930s, [[Atatürk]], founder of the [[Turkey|Turkish Republic]], was interested in Churchward's work and considered Mu as a possible location of the [[Urheimat|original homeland]] of the [[Turkish people|Turks]].&lt;ref&gt;''Kayıp Kıta Mu'', presentation, Ege-Meta Yayınları, İzmir, 2000, {{ISBN|975-7089-20-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Masaaki Kimura]] has suggested that certain underwater features located off the coast of [[Yonaguni|Yonaguni Island]], [[Japan]] (popularly known as the  [[Yonaguni Monument]]) are ruins of Mu&lt;ref name="mukimura"&gt;{{cite book | title = Mu tairiku wa Ryukyu ni atta (The Continent of Mu was in Ryukyu) |first= Masaaki|last=Kimura| publisher = Tokuma Shoten| location = Tokyo | year = 1991 | language = Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Robert M. |last=Schoch | title = Ancient underwater pyramid structure off the coast of Yonaguni-jima| url = http://www.morien-institute.org/yonaguni_schoch1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or "ruins of the lost world of Muin" according to [[CNN]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Japan's Underwater Ruins (video) | url = http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/world/2007/08/24/vo.japan.underwater.ruins.reut | publisher = CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Criticisms==

===Geological arguments===
Modern [[geology|geological]] knowledge rules out "lost continents" of any significant size.  According to the theory of [[plate tectonics]], which has been extensively confirmed since the 1970s, the [[Earth's crust]] consists of lighter "[[sial]]" rocks ([[continental crust]] rich in [[aluminium]] [[silicates]]) that float on heavier "[[sima (geology)|sima]]" rocks ([[oceanic crust]] richer in [[magnesium]] silicates). The sial is generally absent in the ocean floor where the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] is a few kilometers thick, while the continents are huge solid blocks tens of kilometers thick.  Since continents float on the sima much like [[iceberg]]s float on water, a continent cannot simply "sink" under the ocean.&lt;!--See talk page--&gt;

It is true that [[continental drift]] and [[seafloor spreading]] can change the shape and position of continents and occasionally break a continent into two or more pieces (as happened to [[Pangaea]]). However, these are very slow processes that occur in [[geological time scale]]s (hundreds of millions of years). Over the scale of history (tens of thousands of years), the sima under the continental crust can be considered solid, and the continents are basically anchored on it. It is almost certain that the continents and ocean floors have retained their present position and shape for the whole span of human existence.

There is also no conceivable event that could have "destroyed" a continent, since its huge mass of sial rocks would have to end up somewhere—and there is no trace of it at the bottom of the oceans. The [[Oceania|Pacific Ocean islands]] are not part of a submerged landmass but rather the tips of isolated [[volcano]]es.

[[Image:Easter Island map-en.svg|thumb|right|Map of Easter Island showing locations of the ''ahu'' and ''moai'']]

This is the case, in particular, of [[Easter Island]], which is a recent volcanic peak surrounded by deep ocean (3,000 m deep at 30&amp;nbsp;km off the island). After visiting the island in the 1930s, [[Alfred Metraux]] observed that the ''moai'' platforms are concentrated along the current coast of the island, which implies that the island's shape has changed little since they were built. Moreover, the "Triumphal Road" that [[Pierre Loti]] had reported ran from the island to the submerged lands below, is actually a natural lava flow.&lt;ref name="metr"&gt;{{cite book | title = Mysteries of Easter Island | first = Alfred | last = Metraux | url = http://www.davidmetraux.com/daniel/docs/alfred/alfred_metraux_mysteries_of_easter_island.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080406124306/http://www.davidmetraux.com/daniel/docs/alfred/alfred_metraux_mysteries_of_easter_island.pdf | archivedate = 2008-04-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, while Churchward was correct in his claim that the island has no sandstone or sedimentary rocks, the point is moot because the ''[[pukao]]'' are all made of native volcanic [[scoria]].

===Archaeological and genetic evidence===

There is evidence that the civilizations of the [[Americas]] and the [[Old World]] developed independently of each other&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abramyan|first=Evgeny|title=Civilization in the 21st Century|year=2009|publisher=How to Save the Future?|location=Russia|url=http://www.savefuture.net/files/2009edition-en.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118105055/http://www.savefuture.net/files/2009edition-en.pdf|archivedate=2012-01-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|62}} and, in fact, [[agriculture]] and urban societies probably first developed after the end of the [[Ice Age]], somewhere in the [[Levant]] some 10,000 years ago and gradually spread outwards from there to the rest of the Old World. The development of the oldest known cities, such as [[Çatalhöyük]], can more easily be attributed to local and gradual evolution than to the coming of refugees from a "superior civilization".{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===Troano Codex===
Other researchers who have tried to use the [[de Landa alphabet]] have reported that it produces only gibberish. Recent research into the [[Maya script|Mayan "alphabet"]] has shown it to not consist of [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] but [[logogram]]s. Recent translations of the [[Troano Codex]] have shown it to be a treatise on astrology.&lt;ref&gt;Citadels of Mystery, L Sprague deCamp and C decamp, Fontana Books 1969, page 10&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''National Historic Landmark''' ('''NHL''') is a [[National Register of Historic Places property types|building, district, object, site, or structure]] that is officially recognized by the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] for its outstanding historical significance. Of over 90,000 places listed on the country's [[National Register of Historic Places]], only some 2,500 are recognized as National Historic Landmarks.

A '''National Historic Landmark District''' may include [[contributing properties]] that are buildings, structures, sites or objects, and it may include non-contributing properties.  Contributing properties may or may not also be separately listed.

==Creation of the program==
Prior to 1935, efforts to preserve cultural heritage of national importance were made by piecemeal efforts of the United States Congress. In 1935, Congress passed the [[Historic Sites Act]], which authorized the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Interior Secretary]] authority to formally record and organize historic properties, and to designate properties as having "national historical significance", and gave the [[National Park Service]] authority to administer historically significant federally owned properties.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Nicholas. ''Environmental Regulation of Real Property'', Volume 1. New York: Law Journal Press, 1982. pp. 6:22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the following decades, surveys such as the [[Historic American Buildings Survey]] amassed information about culturally and architecturally significant properties in a program known as the Historic Sites Survey.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Antoinette Josephine. ''The American Mosaic: Preserving a Nation's Heritage''. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1997. {{ISBN|978-0-8143-2719-7}}. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the designations made under this legislation became [[National Historic Sites (United States)|National Historic Sites]], although the very first designation, made December 20, 1935, was for a [[List of National Memorials of the United States|National Memorial]], the [[Gateway Arch National Park]] (then known as the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial) in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].  The first National Historic Site designation was made for the [[Salem Maritime National Historic Site]] on March 17, 1938.&lt;ref&gt;McDonnell, Janet; Mackintosh, Barry. ''The National Parks: Shaping the System''. Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 2005. {{ISBN|978-0-912627-73-1}}. p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, the National Park Service took on the administration of the survey data gathered under this legislation, and the National Historic Landmark program began to take more formal shape.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Karolin; Petersen, Patricia. ''Historic Preservation in the USA''.  Berlin: Springer, 2002. {{ISBN|978-3-540-41735-4}}. p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;  When the [[National Register of Historic Places]] was established in 1966, the National Historic Landmark program was encompassed within it, and rules and procedures for inclusion and designation were formalized.  Because listings (either on the National Register, or as an NHL) often triggered local preservation laws, legislation in 1980 amended the listing procedures to require owner agreement to the designations.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, p. 6:24&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 9, 1960, 92 properties were announced as designated NHLs by Secretary of the Interior [[Fred A. Seaton]]. The first of these was a political nomination: the [[Sergeant Floyd Monument]] in [[Sioux City, Iowa]] was officially designated on June 30 of that year, but for various reasons, the public announcement of the first several NHLs was delayed.

==Criteria==
NHLs are designated by the [[United States Secretary of the Interior]] because they are:
* Sites where events of national historical significance occurred;
* Places where prominent persons lived or worked;
* Icons of ideals that shaped the nation;
* Outstanding examples of design or construction;
* Places characterizing a way of life; or
* Archeological sites able to yield information.

==Current NHLs==
[[List of National Historic Landmarks by state|More than 2,500 NHLs]] have been designated. Most, but not all, are in the United States.

There are NHLs in all 50 states and the [[District of Columbia]]. Three states ([[List of National Historic Landmarks in Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], [[List of National Historic Landmarks in Massachusetts|Massachusetts]], and [[List of National Historic Landmarks in New York|New York]]) account for nearly 25 percent of the nation's NHLs. Three cities within these states ([[List of National Historic Landmarks in Boston|Boston]], [[List of National Historic Landmarks in Philadelphia|Philadelphia]], and [[List of National Historic Landmarks in New York City|New York City]]) all separately have more NHLs than 40 of the 50 states. In fact, New York City alone has more NHLs than all but five states: [[List of National Historic Landmarks in Virginia|Virginia]], [[List of National Historic Landmarks in California|California]], Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and New York (the latter of which has the most NHLs of all 50 states). There are 74 NHLs in the District of Columbia.

Some NHLs are in [[List of United States National Historic Landmarks in United States commonwealths and territories, associated states, and foreign states|U.S. commonwealths and territories, associated states, and foreign states]]. There are 15 in [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Virgin Islands]], and other [[U.S. Commonwealth|U.S. commonwealths and territories]]; five in U.S.-associated states such as [[Federated States of Micronesia|Micronesia]]; and [[American Legation, Tangier|one]] in [[Morocco]].&lt;ref name = "NHL_list"&gt;{{Cite web | last = National Park Service | first = | authorlink = National Park Service | last2 = | first2 = | authorlink2 = | date = November 2007 | title = National Historic Landmarks Survey: List of National Historic Landmarks by State | location = | publisher = | edition = | volume = | id = | isbn = | url = http://www.cr.nps.gov/nhl/designations/Lists/LIST07.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = July 1, 2008 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The counts and locations of NHLs are described most accurately in [[List of National Historic Landmarks by state]]. This extends, and corrects errors from, the National Park Service's "National Historic Landmarks Survey List of National Historic Landmarks by State", also referenced.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[List of U.S. National Historic Landmark ships and shipwrecks|Over 100 ships or shipwrecks]] have been designated as NHLs.

==Other==
About half of the National Historic Landmarks are [[Property|privately owned]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/history/nhl/Downloads/UpdateonNHLs2004.pdf National Historic Landmarks Update], National Park Service, October 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The National Historic Landmarks Program relies on suggestions for new designations from the [[National Park Service]], which also assists in maintaining the [[landmarks]]. A friends' group of owners and managers, the National Historic Landmark Stewards Association, works to preserve, protect and promote National Historic Landmarks.

If not already listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], an NHL is automatically added to the Register upon designation. About three percent of Register listings are NHLs.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7955">Since the 18th century, Europeans have been interested in the origins of human migration and the settlement of [[New Zealand]]. Captain James Cook, who arrived in 1769, believed that the [[Māori people|Māori]] were [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] and had come from southeast Asia; however, some other early visitors speculated that they might be descended from ancient Greeks, Romans or Egyptians, and some Christian missionaries thought that the Māori ancestors belonged to the lost tribes of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/ideas-of-maori-origins K. R. Howe. p 1 'Ideas of Māori origins'], ''Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand'', updated 9 Nov 12&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century, ideas about [[Aryan]]  migrations became popular and these were applied to New Zealand. [[Edward Robert Tregear|Edward Tregear]]'s ''The Aryan Maori'' (1885) suggested that Aryans from India migrated to the southeast Asia and then to the islands of the Pacific, including New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/ideas-of-maori-origins/page-2 K. R. Howe. p 2 'Ideas of Māori origins'], ''[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]'', updated 9 Nov 12&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, the [[Moriori people]] were thought to be possibly of [[Melanesian]] rather than Polynesian origin, but they are now regarded as descended from early Maori of the Archaic or Moa-hunter period.

Although [[modern archaeology]] has largely clarified questions of the origin and dates of the earliest migrations, some writers have continued to speculate that what is now New Zealand was discovered by 'Celts', Greeks or Egyptians, before the arrival of the Polynesian ancestors of the Māori.

==Maori oral traditions==
Maori oral traditions speak of spirits or fairy folk living in parts of New Zealand when they arrived. They are known by various names, but most commonly as [[Patupaiarehe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/patupaiarehe/page-1 |title=Patupaiarehe-Patupaiarehe and ponaturi}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Turehu.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/first-peoples-in-maori-tradition/page-5 |title=First peoples in Maori tradition-Patupaiarehe, Turehu and other inhabitants.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent revivals of pre-Maori settlement theories==
Martin Doutré argued in a 1999 book that New Zealand had a pre-Polynesian [[Celts|Celtic]] population, and that boulders with [[petroglyph]]s on a hill in [[Silverdale, Auckland|Silverdale]] in [[Auckland]] are artifacts left by those people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Martin Doutré|title=Ancient Celtic New Zealand |location=Auckland |publisher=Dé Danann Publishers |year=1999 |isbn=9780473053673}} {{cite news|author=Wayne Thompson |title=Call to save hilltop boulders |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10570580 |newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=6 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier presentation of the theory of pre-Polynesian white settlement of New Zealand was [[Kerry Bolton]]'s 1987 pamphlet ''Lords of the Soil'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kerry R. Bolton |authorlink=Kerry Bolton |title=Lords of the Soil|location=Petone |publisher=Realist Publications |year=1987|oclc=154233606}}&lt;/ref&gt; which states that "Polynesia has been occupied by peoples of the [[Caucasian race|Europoid]] race since ancient times".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fightdemback.org/archive/groups/nzwf/ |title=Kerry Bolton — a nut, or just a misunderstood Mormon/Satanist/Nazi? |author=Barrie Sargeant |date=2 December 2004 |publisher=[[Fightdemback]] |accessdate=13 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130414202240/http://www.fightdemback.org/archive/groups/nzwf/ |archivedate=14 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other books presenting such theories have included ''The Great Divide: The Story of New Zealand &amp; its Treaty'', (2012) by [[Ian Wishart (journalist)|Ian Wishart]], a journalist, and ''To the Ends of the Earth'' by Maxwell C. Hill, Gary Cook and Noel Hilliam, which claims that New Zealand was discovered by explorers from ancient Egypt and Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= |title= The Great Divide: The Story of New Zealand and its Treaty |location=Auckland |publisher=Howling at the Moon |year=2012 |isbn=9780987657367 }} {{cite book |author=Maxwell C. Hill |title=To the Ends of the Earth |location= Taupiri |publisher=Ancient History Publications |year=2012 |isbn=9780473206871 }} {{cite news|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Book-claims-European-explorers-were-here-first/tabid/1160/articleID/247752/Default.aspx |title=Book claims European explorers were here first |publisher=[[3 News]] |date=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Rankin, a [[Ngāpuhi]] elder, has drawn attention to [[Maori legends]] suggesting that people, some of them with fair skin, were already present in the islands when the Maori arrived, and has claimed the existence of a conspiracy among academics to suppress inquiry.&lt;ref name=conspiracy&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10856261 | title = Historians rubbish claims of academic conspiracy | author = Rebecca Quilliam | newspaper = [[The New Zealand Herald]] | date = 27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stoush&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/8123896/Stoush-over-pre-Maori-colonisers-theory | title = Stoush over pre-Maori colonisers theory | publisher = [[Stuff.co.nz]], [[Fairfax Media|Fairfax NZ News]] |date = 28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians and archaeologists dismiss the theories. [[Michael King]] wrote in his history of New Zealand, "Despite a plethora of amateur theories about [[Melanesian]], South American, Egyptian, [[Phoenicia]]n and Celtic colonisation of New Zealand, there is not a shred of evidence that the first human settlers were anything other than Polynesian",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael King |authorlink=Michael King |title=The Penguin History of New Zealand |year=1994 |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |isbn=0-14-301867-1 |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Richard Hill, professor of New Zealand Studies at [[Victoria University of Wellington]], said in 2012, "Not one of [the theories] has ever passed any remote academic scrutiny."&lt;ref name=conspiracy/&gt; Hugh Laracy of the [[University of Auckland]] called them "wild speculation" that has been "thoroughly disposed of by academic specialists".&lt;ref name=stoush/&gt;

Another historian, Vincent O'Malley, and the New Zealand Archaeological Association regard the theories as having a racist or at least a political element, seeking to cast doubt on [[Waitangi Tribunal]] claims.&lt;ref name=conspiracy/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alternative Archaeology |url=http://archaeopedia.com/wiki/index.php?title=Alternative_Archaeology |publisher=New Zealand Archaeological Association|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott Hamilton in "No to Nazi Pseudo-history: an Open Letter" further explains objections to the theories of Bolton and Doutré (and the website ''Ancient Celtic New Zealand'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Scott Hamilton|title=No to Nazi Pseudo-history: an Open Letter |url=http://books.scoop.co.nz/2008/11/18/no-to-nazi-pseudo-history-an-open-letter/|publisher=Scoop Review of Books |date=18 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7525">'''Preservation of meaning''' in library, archival or museum collections involves understanding spiritual, ritual, or cultural perceptions of value for specific objects, and ensuring these values are maintained and respected.  Meaning is something assigned to objects of cultural or spiritual significance based on interpretations and perceived values by user populations, a process known as social construction of an object (Barker, 77).  When moved to [[memory institution]]s such as libraries or museums, these objects of social construction require unique approaches to preservation and maintenance in order to remain relevant as representations of cultural or spiritual societies.

In many memory institutions of the Western World, including libraries and museums, focus is often placed on the informational content and physical attributes, or artifactual value, of collected materials.  Preservation policies are primarily concerned with the maintenance of these two things, either through reformatting to preserve textual information, or repairs and environmental controls to ensure continued existence of their physical structure (Foot, 19). However, it is necessary to look beyond the physical and informational aspects of objects in order to ensure we are also preserving the integrity of the spiritual or cultural values which may be fundamental in defining the object.   
 
Concerns arise when actions taken to preserve the physical object may compromise the spiritual or cultural integrity of a given object.  Artifacts, including books, throughout history and the present were created and utilized according to rules and taboos that may not be inherently understood in today's world of mass consumer goods and material culture.  While not all books, documents, and artifacts have rituals or socially constructed beliefs associated with their continued existence, it is a relevant issue for many cultural and religious collections.

== Examples ==

An extreme example of how efforts to physically preserve may compromise the socially constructed meaning of the object is the [[Shinto]] Shrines of Ise Jingu, in [[Japan]] (Maré, 2004).  These shrines are of significant cultural and spiritual value to the Japanese people, but every twenty years since the time of Emperor Temmu in the 7th century C.E. the buildings are completely destroyed and rebuilt.  The rebuilding process is based on descriptions in the Documents on the rituals of the Great Shrine of Ise which dates from 804 C.E. and ensures that the recreations are exact replicas of the shrines taken down.  Physical preservation of these monuments would damage the spiritual and cultural integrity of the process and purpose behind the continuous rebuilding.

Similarly, in the [[Buddhist]] faith, materials are considered to have a life, which must be allowed to progress and end naturally.  Impermanence (anitya) in the Buddhist faith relates to the natural end of all things, [[nirvana]], and acts of physical preservation would be contrary to this belief (Karlström). Buddhist [[Conservation of South Asian household shrines|shrines]] are an example of such items that hold spiritual meaning. 

Physical preservation can also work to maintain spiritual and culture integrity of an object, especially in the case of musical instruments.  At the violin museum in [[Cremona, Italy]], nine instruments crafted by the [[Amatis]], [[Guarneris]], and by Antonio [[Stradivari]] are played ceremoniously six days a week – both to keep them in good physical, playable condition, and to maintain their cultural significance and meaning.  From the island of [[Java]] in [[Indonesia]], the instruments of the [[gamelan]] are treated with respect and reverence, and played on a regular basis to maintain their physical and spiritual life.  They are played only for certain occasions and only by certain individuals trained in the art.  They must also be handled and stored with care to be sure no one should compromise their spiritual integrity by stepping over them.  (Kartomi and Mendonça) Gamelan instruments can be found in museums throughout North America, but to accurately remain gamelan instruments, they must be treated and respected according to both their physical and spiritual properties.

However, examples of the significance of meaning and spiritual integrity exist in North America as well.  ''[[Jish]]'' is a [[Navajo people|Navajo]] medicine bundle used in religious rituals related to curing or prevention, and specific care and established provenance is necessary to preserve the existence of ''jish'' versus a simple bundle of herb and grasses.  [[NAGPRA]], or North American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act has helped to highlight this issue of meaning and spiritual integrity in the United States.  The act not only covers objects and remains recovered from American Indian graves, but the subsequent literary material developed based on the examination and analysis of these objects.  (Grose)

Preservation of meaning is perhaps most relevant and recognized in museum collections, but this does not mean there are not key books and documents that are defined by their social construction as well as their physical existence.  When a book printed on acid paper turns to dust, there is no doubt that it ceases to exist as book.  However, when books are stacked on top of a [[Koran]], or a [[Guru Granth Sahib]] is repaired rather than ceremoniously cremated, the spiritual integrity of these texts is compromised or destroyed, and the physical object is void of spiritual or cultural meaning.  It may at this point actually cease to be what it had been previously identified as, at least in terms of its cultural or spiritual meaning.

Admittedly, more work and research needs to be done in regard to  preservation of meaning in the area of Library Science.  However, it is necessary for libraries and archival institutions to assess their preservation priorities in consideration of social and cultural meaning in tandem with physical attributes and informational context.  Preservation and curatorial policies and activities can take into account how materials are housed, handled, repaired, or analyzed not just in terms of preserving physical qualities, but spiritual and cultural meaning as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9070">In [[Historiography|historical studies]], '''prosopography''' is an investigation of the common characteristics of a historical group, whose individual biographies may be largely untraceable, by means of a collective study of their lives, in multiple career-line analysis.&lt;ref&gt;"multiple career-line analysis (as the social scientists call it)", Lawrence Stone remarked, in "Prosopography", ''Daedalus'' '''100'''.1 (1971), pp. 46&amp;ndash;71.&lt;/ref&gt; Prosopographical research has the goal of learning about patterns of relationships and activities through the study of collective biography; it collects and analyses statistically relevant quantities of biographical data about a well-defined group of individuals. This makes it a valuable technique for studying many pre-modern societies.

==History==
British historian [[Lawrence Stone]] (1919–1999) brought the term to general attention in an explanatory article in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Stone, "Prosopography", ''Daedalus'' '''100'''.1 (1971), pp. 46&amp;ndash;71.&lt;/ref&gt; The word is drawn from the figure of [[prosopopeia]] in classical [[rhetoric]], introduced by [[Quintilian]], in which an absent or imagined person is figured forth—the "face created" as the Greek suggests—in words, as if present.

Stone noted two uses of prosopography as an historian's tool: first, in uncovering deeper interests and connections beneath the superficial rhetoric of politics, in order to examine the structure of the political machine; and second, in analysing the changing roles in society of particular status groups—holders of offices, members of associations—and assessing social mobility through family origins and social connections of recruits to those offices or memberships. "Invented as a tool of political history," Stone observed, "it is now being increasingly employed by the social historians."&lt;ref&gt;Stone 1971:47.&lt;/ref&gt;

A certain mass of data is required for prosopographical research.&lt;ref&gt;The classic early example of prosopography was the series of volumes of ''Prosopographia Imperii Romanae'', edited by P. von Rohden and H. Dessau, (Berlin), appearing from 1897, which amassed a database covering the governing class of the Roman [[Principate]].&lt;/ref&gt; The collection of data underlies the creation of a prosopography and, in contemporary research, this is usually in the form of an electronic database. But data assembly is not the goal of the research; rather, the objective is to understand patterns and relationships by analysing the data. A uniform set of criteria needs to be applied to the group in order to achieve meaningful results. And, as with any historical study, understanding the context of the lives studied is essential.

In the words of prosopographer [[Katharine Keats-Rohan]], "prosopography is about what the analysis of the sum of data about many individuals can tell us about the different types of connection between them, and hence about how they operated within and upon the institutions—social, political, legal, economic, intellectual—of their time".&lt;ref&gt;Keats-Rohan, Katharine. ''History and Computing''. 12:1, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this sense prosopography is clearly related to, but distinct from, both [[biography]] and [[genealogy]]. Whilst biography and prosopography overlap, and prosopography is interested in the details of individuals' lives, a prosopography is more than the plural of biography. A prosopography is not just any collection of biographies—the lives must have enough in common for relationships and connections to be uncovered. Genealogy, as practiced by family historians, has as its goal the reconstruction of familial relationships, and as such, well-conducted genealogical research may form the basis of a prosopography, but the goals of prosopographical research are generally wider. 

The nature of prosopographical research has developed over time. In his 1971 essay, Lawrence Stone discussed an "older" form of prosopography which was principally concerned with well-known social elites, many of whom were already well-known historical figures. Their genealogies were well-researched, and social webs and kinship linking could be traced, allowing a prosopography of a "power elite" to emerge. Prominent examples which Stone drew upon were the work of [[Charles A. Beard]] and Sir [[Lewis Namier]]. Charles Beard's ''[[An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States]]'' (1913) offered an explanation of the form and content of the [[U.S. Constitution]] by looking at the class background and economic interests of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]]. Sir [[Lewis Namier]] produced an equally influential study of the 18th century [[British House of Commons]], and inspired a circle of historians whom Stone light-heartedly termed "Namier Inc." 

Stone contrasted this older prosopography with what in 1971 was the newer form of quantitative prosopography, which concern was with much wider populations including, particularly, "ordinary people". An example of this kind of work, published slightly later, is [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]]'s pioneering work of [[microhistory]], ''[[Montaillou|Montaillou: The Promised Land of Error]]'' (1978), which developed a picture of patterns of kinship and heresy, daily and seasonal routine, in a small [[Occitania|Occitan]] village, the last pocket of [[Cathars]], over a 30-year period from 1294 to 1324. Stone anticipated that this new form of prosopography would become dominant as part of a growing wave of [[Social Science History]]. But prosopography and other associated forms of social science and quantitative history went into a period of decline during the 1980s. In the 1990s, however, perhaps because of developments in computing, and particularly in database software, prosopography was revived. The "new prosopography" has since become clearly established as an important approach in historical research.

'''Reception theory''' is a version of [[Reader-response criticism|reader response]] [[literary theory]] that emphasizes each particular reader's reception or interpretation in making meaning from a [[literary text]]. Reception theory is generally referred to as [[audience reception]] in the analysis of [[communications]] models. In literary studies, reception theory originated from the work of [[Hans-Robert Jauss]] in the late 1960s, and the most influential work was produced during the 1970s and early 1980s in Germany and the US (Fortier 132), with some notable work done in other Western European countries. A form of reception theory has also been applied to the study of [[historiography]].

The cultural theorist [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] was one of the main proponents of reception theory, first developed in his 1973 essay 'Encoding and Decoding in the Television Discourse'. His approach, called the [[encoding/decoding model of communication]], is a form of textual analysis that focuses on the scope of "negotiation" and "opposition" by the [[audience]]. This means that a "text"—be it a book, movie, or other creative work—is not simply passively accepted by the audience, but that the reader/viewer interprets the meanings of the text based on her or his individual cultural background and life experiences. In essence, the meaning of a text is not inherent within the text itself, but is created within the relationship between the text and the reader. 

Hall also developed a theory of encoding and decoding, [[Hall's Theory|Hall's theory]], which focuses on the communication processes at play in texts that are in televisual form. 

Reception theory has since been extended to the spectators of performative events, focusing predominantly on the theatre. Susan Bennett is often credited with beginning this discourse. Reception theory has also been applied to the history and analysis of landscapes, through the work of the landscape historian [[John Dixon Hunt]], as Hunt recognized that the survival of gardens and landscapes is largely related to their public reception.

==General==
A basic acceptance of the meaning of a specific text tends to occur when a group of readers have a shared cultural background and interpret the text in similar ways. It is likely that the less shared heritage a reader has with the artist, the less he or she will be able to recognise the artist's intended meaning, and it follows that if two readers have vastly different cultural and personal experiences, their reading of a text will vary greatly. [[Umberto Eco]] coined the term [[aberrant decoding]] to describe the case when the reader's interpretation differs from what the artist intended.&lt;ref name=Eco1972&gt;{{cite book|last=Eco|first=Umberto|title=Working Papers in Cultural Studies|chapter=Towards a semiotic inquiry into the television message|year=1972|publisher=University of Birmingham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Landscape architecture ==
In literature, the interaction between text and reader occurs within a framework that controls and limits the interaction, through genre, tone, structure, and the social conditions of the reader and author, whereas in landscapes the interaction occurs through movement and viewing, framed by typology instead of genre and tone.  Instead of an "implied reader", reception theory of landscapes assumes an "implied visitor", who is an abstracted concatenation of responses of many visitors at different times.  

The theory recognizes that there is no single reading of a landscape that fulfills its entire potential, and that it is important to examine the motives of visitors and the factors influencing their visits (whether they read guidebooks about the place before visiting, or had strong feelings about the place or the designer, for instance).  

One key difference between reception theory in literature and reception theory in landscape architecture is that while literary works are accessible only to the imagination, physical landscapes are accessible to the senses as well as to the imagination.

Reception theoretical analysis of architecture differs from typical writing on the history and analysis of landscapes, which tends to focus on the intentions of the designers, the conditions leading to the creation of the design, and the building process.  Reception theory also tends to de-emphasize commonly used terms of description like 'formal' and 'picturesque', unless those terms were known to have meaning to landscape visitors themselves.

==Reception history ==
According to [[Harold Marcuse]],&lt;ref&gt;Harold Marcuse, [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], Department of History [http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/marcuse/receptionhist.htm Reception History: Definition and Quotations.]&lt;/ref&gt; '''reception history''' is "the history of the meanings that have been imputed to historical events. It traces the different ways in which participants, observers, historians and other retrospective interpreters have attempted to make sense of events both as they unfolded and over time since then, to make those events meaningful for the present in which they lived and live."

'''Smihula waves''' (or '''Smihula cycles''', '''Smihula waves of technological revolutions''', '''economic waves of technological revolutions''') are long-term  waves of technological progress which are reflected also in  [[long-term economic waves]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.longwavegroup.com/news/2010/_pdf/100916_Kondratieff.pdf Niels Posthumus: Financiële lente is nog ver weg (Trouw, 12/11/10)]&lt;/ref&gt;  They are a crucial notion of [[Daniel Šmihula]]'s  theory of [[technological progress]].

==Characteristics of the theory==
The '''Smihula's theory of waves of technological revolutions''' is based on the idea that the main [[technological innovation]]s are introduced in [[society]] and the [[economy]] not continually but in specific waves, and the time spans of these waves is shortening due to technological progress.&lt;ref&gt;Šmihula, Daniel (2009): ''The waves of the technological innovations of the modern age and the present crisis as the end of the wave of the informational technological revolution, Studia politica Slovaca, 1/2009, Bratislava, {{ISSN|1337-8163}}, pp. 32–47'' [http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/getdocument.aspx?logid=6&amp;id=3827075e-0e06-4447-8d1c-f99c78126ba2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Šmihula, Daniel (2011): ''Long waves of technological innovations, Studia politica Slovaca, 2/2011, Bratislava, {{ISSN|1337-8163}}, pp. 50–69'' [http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/issuedetails.aspx?issueid=1694cf40-a011-408f-81f1-ccbf49d05813&amp;articleId=bf83511f-24cb-4906-acc4-824e6374ec20]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D.Šmihula: Informačná a komunikačná revolúcia sa stáva minulosťou, SLOVO, 2008 {{cite web |url=http://www.noveslovo.sk/c/12476/Informacna_a_komunikacna_revolucia_sa_stava_minulostou |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120908063605/http://www.noveslovo.sk/c/12476/Informacna_a_komunikacna_revolucia_sa_stava_minulostou |archivedate=2012-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The time period with the highest concentration of technological [[innovations]] is labeled as a "'''technological revolution'''"
A period of technological revolution (an '''innovation phase''') is associated with economic revival. When new but also already-proven and reliable technologies are available, the interest in new technological development temporary declines and investments are diverted from research to their maximal practical utilization. This period we can designate as an '''application phase'''. It is also associated with economic growth and perhaps even an economic boom. However, at a certain moment [[Profit (accounting)|profitability]] (profit/price ratio) from new innovations and new sectors  declines to the level acquired from older traditional sectors. [[Market (economics)|Markets]] are saturated by technological products – ([[market saturation]] – everybody has a mobile phone, every small town has a railway station) and new capital investment in this originally new sector will not bring any above-average profit (e.g. the first railways connected the biggest cities with many potential passengers, later ones had ever smaller and smaller customer potential, and the level of profit from each new railway was therefore lower than from the previous one). At this moment '''economic stagnation''' and [[crisis]] begin – but a will to risk and to try something new emerges. The stagnation and crisis are therefore overcome by a new technological revolution with new [[innovation]]s which will revitalize the economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brianchandesign.com/?cat=12 Brian Chan: Future of Product Design (2011)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809073411/http://www.brianchandesign.com/?cat=12 |date=2011-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  And this new technological revolution is the beginning of a new wave.&lt;ref&gt;[http://e-shipyard.net/shipbuilding/market-forecasts.html Shipbuilding – Market Forecast] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711230341/http://e-shipyard.net/shipbuilding/market-forecasts.html |date=2012-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The internal structure of each '''long wave of technological innovations''' with economic implications is as follows:

a) '''innovation phase''' – technological revolution (an economic revival after the [[crisis]] from the end of a previous wave)

b) '''application phase''' (an economic boom)

c) '''saturation of economy and society with innovations''', impossibility of further extensive growth (an economic crisis)

==Technological revolutions==
In Smihula theory technological revolutions are the main engine of [[economic development]], and hence [[long-term economic cycles]] are dependent on these waves of technological innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Halina Ward: "The Future of Democracy in the Face of Climate Change", Foundation for Democracy and Sustainable Development (January 2012), p. 86 and 127&lt;/ref&gt;
Smihula identified during the modern age in society '''six waves of technological innovations''' begun by technological revolutions (one of them is a hypothetical revolution in the near future).
Unlike other scholars he believed that it is possible to find similar '''technological revolutions''' and long-term economic waves dependant on them even in '''pre-modern ages'''. (This is the most original part of the Smihula's theory.)

Theory of Smihula waves of technological revolutions is popular among supporters of the '''long economic waves''' (e.g. [[Kondratieff cycles]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tradingborsa.net/finanza-dal-web/8898/kondratiev-e-le-sue-ondekondratiev-and-the-waves/ KONDRATIEV E LE SUE ONDE/KONDRATIEV AND THE WAVES (2011)] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130222144751/http://www.tradingborsa.net/finanza-dal-web/8898/kondratiev-e-le-sue-ondekondratiev-and-the-waves/ |date=2013-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and among scholars who believs that the [[economic crisis in 2007–2012]] was a result of the technological stagnation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tenminutecup.org/2011/12/smihulas-modified-kondratiev-wave-schema/ Smihula's Modified Kondratiev-Wave Schema]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kondratieffwavecycle.com/kondratieff-wave/ Kondratieff Wave]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lewyland.blogspot.com/2011/10/kondratieff-waves-crashed-western.html Lewy Land: Kondratieff Waves...

Veronika Hornung-Prähauser, MAS: Systemic innovations enabled by information and communication technology in education (2011) [http://publik.tuwien.ac.at/files/PubDat_207037.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russians|Russian]] sociologist A.A. Davydov believes that he even identified a specific mathematical formula for the lengths of Smihula waves which is based on the [[Fibonacci sequence]].&lt;ref&gt;А.А.Давыдов: ВОЛНЫ ИННОВАЦИЙ И ЧИСЛА ФИБОНАЧЧИ: ОЦЕНКА ПЕРСПЕКТИВНОСТИ ГИПОТЕЗЫ  [http://www.ssa-rss.ru/files/File/KomitetyROS/SystemSociology/Fibonacci_Numbers.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
As Smihula published his theory in the time of revived interest in long economic cycles and when a link between economic cycles and technological revolutions was generally accepted (e.g. in works of [[Carlota Perez]]), it did not evoke strong criticism or opposition.
On the other side it has the same problem as the other long-cycles theories – it is sometime hard to support them by exact data and the potential curve of a long time development is always modified by other short-time factors – therefore its course is always only a rather abstract reconstruction. Also the idea of concentration of the most important innovation in certain bordered periods seems to be very logical, but its verification depends on a very subjective definition of the "most important" [[innovation]]s.
Smihula's theory of long waves of technological innovations and economic cycles dependent on them is more popular in [[Russia]], [[Brazil]]&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Barbosa da Cunha: RELATÓRIO E PARECER PRÉVIO DAS CONTAS ANUAIS DO GOVERNO DO ESTADO DO PARÁ EXERCÍCIO 2009 (2010)[http://www.tce.pa.gov.br/contas_governo_do_estado_2009/ACG2009.relatorio_e_parecer_previo.pdf]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[India]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:pYrcf2W8h8MJ:www.wasankarwealth.com/HomeControls/OpenPDF.aspx?File%3D930_Riding%2520the%2520Bull.pdf+smihula+kondratiev&amp;hl=sk&amp;gl=sk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShn9R5pKnrbfQnFx6MLNTDs6tripmjpnbniOzQgJXH40ISqBBB0riDHISMf_X1WopW_CVc3peW5Uu-RJGQ1JyuG_gVQ4Ad7lWL_XeiNJwKrWyIrGbKQBKHtxy-1T7PycOpn26p4&amp;sig=AHIEtbT-dcohjtvq9yhp7A7FtTnAiBaUIg Dr. Prashant Wasankar: Riding the Bull]&lt;/ref&gt; than in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Enrico Tronchin: Disruptive innovation for sustained economic growth, Why New Zealand’s innovation system should be open, distributed and inclusive of innovative users (2011), in Proceedings of the International Conference on Invention, Innovation and Commercialisation with special emphasis on Technology Users Innovation (TUI), p.37 [http://hdl.handle.net/10182/3831][https://vimeo.com/26851411]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simon Berkovich: Obtaining inexhaustible clean energy by parametric resonance under nonlocality clocking (2010) {{cite web |url=http://www.chronos.msu.ru/RREPORTS/berkovich_prime_energy.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513164458/http://www.chronos.msu.ru/RREPORTS/berkovich_prime_energy.pdf |archivedate=2012-05-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It won two [[Grammy Award]]s in [[48th Grammy Awards|2006]], [[Grammy Award for Best Historical Album|Best Historical Album]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Album Notes|Best Album Notes]].

== Background ==
In 1938, noted [[musicology|musicologist]] and Morton [[biography|biographer]] [[Alan Lomax]] conducted a series of interviews with Morton at the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref name="pekar" /&gt; [[Richard Cook (journalist)|Richard Cook]] and [[Brian Morton (Scottish writer)|Brian Morton]] describe these recordings as Jelly Roll Morton's "virtual history of the birth pangs of jazz as it happened in the New Orleans of the turn of the century. His memory was unimpaired, although he chose to tell things as he preferred to remember them, perhaps; and his hands were still in complete command of the keyboard."&lt;ref name="penguin" /&gt;

Excerpts from the sessions first appeared on a 1948 album.&lt;ref name="wynn" /&gt; [[Riverside Records]] issued the recordings as [[LP record]]s in 1955.&lt;ref name="allmusic2" /&gt;  [[Ron Wynn]] and Bruce Boyd Raeburn note that "though the albums came out posthumously, the interviews generated tremendous new interest in Morton's life and music."&lt;ref name="wynn" /&gt; During the 1990s, [[Rounder Records]] released a series of [[compact disc]]s including the musical content, but not the dialogue, from the 1938 sessions.&lt;ref name="allmusic3" /&gt; Both the Riverside and earlier Rounder releases were heavily expurgated, and as recently as 2008, when selections from the complete Rounder collection were featured in a [[BBC Radio 4]] documentary on Morton, presenter Marybeth Hamilton noted that, even then, some of the recordings were still considered unsuitable for broadcast, due to the obscene nature of some of the lyrics and Morton's narration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00by4y6 BBC Radio 4 - The Dream Time of Jazz (originally broadcast 7 July 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2005 release ==
In 2005, Rounder released the 1938 recordings in their entirety as part of an eight-disc box set.&lt;ref name="pekar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="allmusic" /&gt;  The first seven discs include Lomax's 1938 interviews, in which Morton describes his life and the early days of jazz, plays [[piano]], and [[Singing|sings]].&lt;ref name="pekar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="allmusic" /&gt; The eighth disc includes 1949 recordings of Morton's contemporaries, reminiscing about Morton and providing musical demonstrations.&lt;ref name="pekar" /&gt;

The set was originally released in a piano-shaped box and included a copy of ''Mister Jelly Roll'', Lomax's biography about Morton.&lt;ref name="allmusic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rounder1" /&gt; The set also includes a [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] file including additional liner notes, complete transcriptions of the recorded dialogue and lyrics, additional unrecorded interviews and archival documents and photos.&lt;ref name="allmusic" /&gt;

In 2007, Rounder released ''Jelly Roll Morton: The Library of Congress Recordings by Alan Lomax'', a single disc consisting of selected highlights from the box set.&lt;ref name="allmusic2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rounder2" /&gt;

arwulf arwulf, writing for [[allmusic]], described the recordings as having been "beautifully restored."&lt;ref name="allmusic" /&gt;

[[Harvey Pekar]], writing for ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'', gave the set a five-star rating (of a possible five), noting that "[Morton's] oral history here is provocative, and his playing bears out some of the hard-to-believe statements that have been made by (and about) him."&lt;ref name="pekar" /&gt;

Richard Cook and Brian Morton, writing for ''[[The Penguin Guide to Jazz]]'', gave the set a four-star rating (of a possible four), describing it as "surely the most comprehensive coverage of the speech and music to date.… It is a wonderfully illustrated lecture on Morton's music by the man who created it. Indispensable records for anyone interested in jazz history."&lt;ref name="penguin" /&gt;

[[File:David Roberts-IsraelitesLeavingEgypt 1828.jpg|thumb|300px|''Departure of the Israelites'', ([[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]], 1829)]]

'''The Exodus''' is the [[founding myth]] of the [[Israelites]].{{sfn|Sparks|2010|p=73}}{{efn|The name "exodus" is from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἔξοδος ''exodos'', "going out". For "myth" see Sparks, 2010, p. 73: "Charter (i.e., foundation) myths tell the story of a society's origins, and, in doing so, provide the ideological foundations for the culture and its institutions."{{sfn|Sparks|2010|p=73}}}} Spread over the books of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]], and [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]], it tells of the enslavement that befell the children of Israel in Egypt, their liberation through the hand of [[Yahweh]] and the revelations at [[Sinai]], and their wanderings in the wilderness up to borders of [[Canaan#In Jewish and Christian Scriptures|Canaan]], the land their God has given them.{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=59}} Its message is that Israel was delivered from slavery by Yahweh and therefore belongs to him through the [[Mosaic covenant]], the terms of which are that Yahweh will protect his chosen people for all time, so long as they will keep his laws and worship only him.{{sfn|Sparks|2010|p=73}}{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|p=28-29}} The narrative and its laws remain central to [[Judaism]], recounted daily in [[Jewish prayers]] and celebrated in festivals such as [[Passover]], as well as serving as an inspiration and model for non-Jewish groups from early Protestants fleeing persecution in Europe to African-Americans striving for freedom and civil rights.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=107}}

The traditions behind the Exodus story can be traced in the writings of the 8th-century BCE prophets, beyond which their history is obscured by centuries of transmission.{{sfn|Lemche|1985|p=327}}{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=63}} No historical basis for the biblical Exodus story exists;{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=81}} instead, archaeology suggests a native [[Canaan]]ite origin for ancient Israel.{{sfn|Meyers|2005|pp=6–7}}

==Summary==
===Narrative===
[[File:1867 Edward Poynter - Israel in Egypt.jpg|thumb|400px|''Israel in Egypt'' ([[Edward Poynter]], 1867)]]
The story of the Exodus is told in the books of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Leviticus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]], and [[Deuteronomy]], the last four of the five books of the [[Torah]] (also called the Pentateuch). It begins with the [[Israelites]] in slavery. Their prophet [[Moses]] leads them out of Egypt and through the wilderness to [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]], where [[Yahweh]] reveals himself to his people and establishes the [[Mosaic covenant]]: they are to keep his ''torah'' (i.e. law, instruction), and in return he will give them the land of Canaan. The Israelites accept the covenant and receive their laws, and, with Yahweh now present in their midst, journey on from Sinai, towards the promised land, but when [[The Twelve Spies|told that the land is filled with giants]] they refuse to go on, and Yahweh condemns them to remain in the desert until the generation that left Egypt passes away. After thirty-eight years at the oasis of [[Kadesh Barnea]] the next generation travel on to the borders of Canaan, where Moses addresses them for the final time, reviewing their travels and giving them further laws. The Exodus ends with the death of Moses on [[Mount Nebo]] and his burial by [[Yahweh]], while the Israelites prepare for the conquest of the land.{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=59-60}}

===Covenant and law===
The climax of the Exodus is the covenant (binding legal agreement) between God and Israel mediated by Moses at Sinai: Yahweh will protect Israel as his chosen people for all time, and  Israel will keep Yahweh's laws and worship only him.{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|p=28-29}} The covenant is described in stages: at Exodus 24:3–8 the Israelites agree to abide by the "book of the covenant" that Moses has just read to them; shortly afterwards God writes the "words of the covenant" – the [[Ten Commandments]] – on stone tablets; and finally, as the people gather in Moab to cross into Canaan, the land God has promised them, Moses makes a new covenant between Yahweh and Israel "beside the covenant he made with them at Horeb" (Deuteronomy 29:1).{{sfn|McKenzie|2000|p=4-5}} The laws are set out in a number of codes:{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|p=146}}
* [[Ethical Decalogue]] (i.e., the Ten Commandments), Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5;
* The [[Covenant Code|Book of the Covenant]], Exodus 20:22–23:3;
* [[Ritual Decalogue]], Exodus 34;
* The ritual laws of [[Leviticus]] 1–6 and [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 1–10;
* The [[Holiness Code]], Leviticus 17–26;
* Deuteronomic Code, [[Deuteronomy]] 12–26.

==Composition==

Scholars are broadly agreed that the publication of the Torah took place in the mid-Persian period (the 5th century BCE), echoing a traditional Jewish view which gives [[Ezra]], the leader of the Jewish community on its return from Babylon, a pivotal role in its promulgation.{{sfn|Romer|2008|p=2 and fn.3}} The tradition behind it stretches back some two hundred years before then, to a point in the late 7th century BCE when various oral and written elements were drawn together into works which were the fore-runners of the Torah we know today.{{sfn|McEntire|2008|p=8}} The first trace appears in the northern prophets [[Book of Amos|Amos]] (possibly) and [[Book of Hosea|Hosea]] (certainly), both active in the 8th century BCE in  northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], but their southern contemporaries [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] and [[Book of Micah|Micah]] show no knowledge of an exodus.{{sfn|Lemche|1985|p=327}}{{efn|Micah 6:45 ("I brought you up out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery; I sent Moses to lead you, also Aaron and Miriam. My people, remember what Balak king of Moab plotted and what Balaam son of Beor answered. Remember your journey from Shittim to Gilgal, that you may know the righteous acts of the Lord”) is a late addition to the original book. See {{sfn|Lemche|1985|p=315}}}} The story may, therefore, have originated a few centuries earlier, perhaps the 9th or 10th BCE, and there are signs that it took different forms in Israel, in the [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan region]], and in the southern [[Kingdom of Judah]] before being unified in the Persian era.{{sfn|Russell|2009|p=1}}

Many theories have been advanced to explain the composition of the Torah, but two have been especially influential.{{sfn|Ska|2006|pp=217}} The first of these, Persian Imperial authorisation, advanced by Peter Frei in 1985, holds that the Persian authorities required the Jews of Jerusalem to present a single body of law as the price of local autonomy.{{sfn|Ska|2006|pp=218}} Frei's theory was demolished at an interdisciplinary symposium held in 2000, but the relationship between the Persian authorities and Jerusalem remains a crucial question.{{sfn|Eskenazi|2009|p=86}} The second theory, associated with Joel P. Weinberg and called the "Citizen-Temple Community", proposes that the Exodus story was composed to serve the needs of a post-exilic Jewish community organised around the Temple, which acted in effect as a bank for those who belonged to it.{{sfn|Ska|2006|pp=226–227}} The Torah (the Exodus story) served as an "identity card" defining who belonged to this community (i.e., to Israel), thus reinforcing Israel's unity through its new institutions.{{sfn|Ska|2006|p=225}}

==Cultural significance==
[[File:A Seder table setting.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A Seder table setting, commemorating the Passover and Exodus]]
The Exodus is at the centre of Jewish identity.{{sfn|Barmash|2015a|p=vii}} It is remembered daily in [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings|Jewish prayers]] and celebrated each year at the feasts of [[Pesach]] (Passover) and [[Shavuot]], the two being known respectively as "the time of our freedom" and "the time our [[Torah]] was given".{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} The two are closely linked, with Pesach announcing that the freedom it introduces is only fully realised with the giving of the law (the Torah).{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} A third Jewish festival, [[Sukkot]], the Festival of Booths, commemorates how the Israelites lived in booths following the exodus from their previous homes in Egypt.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} The Exodus roots Jewish religion in history, in contrast to pagan religions which are oriented towards nature.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} The festivals now associated with the exodus (Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot) began as agricultural and seasonal feasts but became completely subsumed into the central Exodus myth of Israel's deliverance from oppression at the hands of God.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} The idea that the relationship between God and Israel is defined by the covenant ("brit") made at Sinai is central to Jewish identity, together with the laws given to Israel and the thirteen attributes of God revealed there.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} The fringes worn at the corners of traditional Jewish prayer shawls are a physical reminder of the obligation to observe the laws given at the climax of Exodus: "Look at it and recall all the commandments of the Lord" (Numbers).{{sfn|Sarason|2015|p=53}}

The Exodus has also resonated through non-Jewish culture. Some influences have been trivial but curiously significant – medieval Irish and Scottish legendary history, for example, derived the name of Scotland from Scota, supposedly a daughter of the pharaoh of the Exodus who later emigrated to the British isles.{{sfn|Assmann|2018|p=335}} Others have been more significant: the hostility of the exodus tradition to the State (specifically to Egypt and the pharaoh) played a role in the [[Puritan Revolution]] in 17th-century England,
many early American settlers interpreted their flight from religious persecution in Europe to a new life overseas as a type of exodus, Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin recommended that the Great Seal of the United States show Moses leading the Israelites across the Red Sea, and African Americans suffering under slavery and racial oppression interpreted their situation in terms of the Exodus, making it a catalyst for social change.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=107}}{{sfn|Assmann|2018|p=335}}{{sfn|Coomber|2012|p=123}} [[Mormon pioneers]] to Utah compared their journey to the biblical Exodus and adopted many place names.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Remembering the Exodus — both ancient and modern|author=Daniel Peterson

==Sources, parallels and genre==
[[File:Israelite pillared house.jpg|thumb|Levantine four-roomed house.]]
===Sources and parallels===
While the Exodus story is no older than the Babylonian exile, there are indications that some historical memories underlie it: the name of Moses is Egyptian, for example, and many scholars have found it improbable that a humiliating tradition of slavery would simply be invented.{{sfn|Collins|2014|p=113}} Egyptologist [[Jan Assmann]] suggests that it has no single origin, but rather combines numerous historical experiences into "a coherent story that is fictional as to its composition but historical as to some of its components" (Assmann, 2014).{{sfn|Assmann|2014|p=unpaginated}} Thus the memory of Egyptian oppression may be based on the harsh treatment of Canaanites inside Canaan in the 2nd millennium, when the region was ruled by Egypt: these memories could later have been transferred to Egypt itself, and a new exodus story created.{{sfn|Anderson|Gooder|2017|p=unpaginated}} A historical Moses associated with a small group may have been later generalised into the savior of Israel, while the history of the [[Hyksos]], who were Canaanite rulers of the Egyptian Delta in the 16th century BCE, may have formed the basis of the descent into Egypt and the exodus.{{sfn|Collins|2005|p=45-46}}

===Genre===
The meaning a reader takes away from a text depends on his or her understanding of the literary "type" to which it belongs: as one scholar puts it in his discussion of the [[Genesis creation myth]], "it makes an enormous difference whether the first chapters of Genesis are read as scientific cosmology, creation myth, or historical saga" (Wood, 1990).{{sfn|Wood|1990|pp=323–24}} There is an almost universal consensus among scholars that the Exodus story is best understood as myth.{{sfn|Collins|2005|p=46}} More specifically, its can be understood as a "charter" (or foundation) myth, a myth told to explain a society's origins and to provide the ideological foundation for its culture and institutions.{{sfn|Sparks|2010|p=73}}

== Historicity ==
After a century of research by [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] and [[Egyptology|Egyptologists]]{{sfn|Meyers|2005|p=5}} the consensus of modern scholars is that the Bible does not give an accurate account of the origins of Israel.{{sfn|Davies|2015|p=51}}  There is no indication that the [[Israelites]] ever lived in [[Ancient Egypt]], and the [[Sinai Peninsula]] shows almost no sign of any occupation for the entire 2nd millennium BCE (even [[Kadesh (Israel)|Kadesh-Barnea]], where the Israelites are said to have spent 38 years, was uninhabited prior to the establishment of the Israelite monarchy).{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=77}} In contrast to the absence of evidence for  the Egyptian captivity and wilderness wanderings, there are ample signs of Israel's evolution within Canaan from native Canaanite roots.{{sfn|Barmash|2015b|p=4}}{{sfn|Shaw|2002|p=313}}  While a few scholars discuss the historicity, or at least plausibility, of the Exodus story, the majority of archaeologists have abandoned it, in the phrase used by archaeologist William Dever, as "a fruitless pursuit".{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=89}}{{sfn|Dever|2001|p=99}}

Details point to a 1st millennium date for the composition of the narrative: [[Ezion-Geber]] (one of the [[Stations of the Exodus]]), for example, dates to a period between the 8th and 6th centuries BCE with possible further occupation into the 4th century BCE,{{sfn|Pratico|DiVito|1993|pp=1–32}} and those place-names on the Exodus route which have been identified – [[Land of Goshen|Goshen]], [[Pithom]], [[Sukkot (place)|Succoth]], [[Pi-Ramesses|Ramesses]] and [[Kadesh (Israel)|Kadesh Barnea]] – point to the geography of the 1st millennium rather than the 2nd.{{sfn|Van Seters|1997|pp=255ff}} Similarly, [[Pharaoh]]'s fear that the [[Israelites]] might ally themselves with foreign invaders seems unlikely in the context of the late 2nd millennium, when [[Canaan]] was part of an [[New Kingdom of Egypt|Egyptian empire]] and Egypt faced no enemies in that direction, but does make sense in a 1st millennium context, when Egypt was considerably weaker and faced invasion first from the [[Achaemenid Empire]] and later from the [[Seleucid Empire]].{{sfn|Soggin|1998|pp=128–29}} The mention of the [[dromedary]] in Exodus 9:3 also suggests a later date – the widespread domestication of the [[camel]] as a herd animal is thought not to have taken place before the late 2nd millennium, after the Israelites had already emerged in Canaan,{{sfn|Finkelstein|Silberman|2002|p=334}} and they did not become widespread in Egypt until c. 200–100 BCE.{{sfn|Faye|2013|p=3}}

The chronology of the Exodus narrative is symbolic: for example, its culminating event, the erection of the [[Tabernacle]] as Yahweh's dwelling-place among his people, occurs in the year [[Chronology of the Bible|2666 Anno Mundi]] (Year of the World, meaning 2666 years after God creates the world), and two-thirds of the way through a four thousand year era which culminates in or around the re-dedication of the [[Second Temple]] in 164 BCE.{{sfn|Hayes|Miller|1986|p=59}}{{sfn|Davies|1998|p=180}}

'''''The Lost Tomb of Jesus''''' is a [[Documentary film|documentary]] co-produced and first broadcast on the [[Discovery Channel]] and [[Vision TV]] in [[Canada]] on March 4, 2007, covering the discovery of the [[Talpiot Tomb]]. It was directed by Canadian documentary and film maker [[Simcha Jacobovici]] and produced by Felix Golubev and [[Ric Esther Bienstock]], while [[James Cameron]] served as executive producer. (Jacobovici and Cameron had previously created ''[[The Exodus Decoded]]''.)  The film was released in conjunction with a book about the same subject, ''[[The Jesus Family Tomb]]'', issued in late February 2007 and co-authored by Jacobovici and [[Charles R. Pellegrino]]. The documentary and book's claims are the subject of controversy within the [[archaeologists|archaeological]] and [[theologians|theological]] fields, as well as among linguistic and biblical scholars.

==Content==
The film describes the finding of the Talpiot Tomb during a housing construction project, and posits that it was the family tomb of [[Jesus]]. The film states that ten [[Ossuary|ossuaries]] were found in the cave, of which six are the subject of the film. Further, it claims that one of the ten ossuaries went missing years ago, presumably stolen.

The excavation report for the predecessor of the Israel Antiquities Authority was written by Amos Kloner, now professor of archaeology at Israel's [[Bar-Ilan University]]. Kloner dissociated himself from the claims made in the documentary. He said it was incorrect to call it "never before reported information" and that he had published all the details in the journal ''Antiqot'' in 1996. He had not said it was the tomb of Jesus' family.&lt;ref  name=cnsnews&gt;[http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/jesus-tomb-filmmakers-should-be-ashamed-archeologist-says "'Jesus Tomb' Filmmakers Should Be Ashamed, Archeologist Says"]&lt;/ref&gt; "I think it is very unserious [sic] work. I do scholarly work…," Kloner said. "[This film] is all nonsense."&lt;ref  name=cnsnews/&gt;

Six of the nine remaining ossuaries bear inscriptions. ''The Lost Tomb of Jesus'' posits that three of those carry the names of figures from the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref name="Discovery News"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2007/02/25/tomb_arc.html?category=archaeology&amp;guid=20070225073000 |title=Jesus Family Tomb Believed Found |last=Viegas |first=Jennifer |publisher=[[Discovery Channel]] |date=2007-02-25 |accessdate=2007-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307120414/http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2007/02/25/tomb_arc.html?category=archaeology&amp;guid=20070225073000 |archivedate=2007-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The meanings of the [[epigraphy|epigraphs]] are disputed.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://aramaicdesigns.blogspot.com/search?q=Jesus+son+of+Joseph The Aramaic Blog]&lt;/ref&gt; The makers of the documentary claim that four leading [[epigrapher]]s have corroborated their interpretation of the inscriptions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/02/070228135009.htm The Lost Tomb Of Jesus? Religious Scholar Provides Insight On The Controversy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; As translated in ''The Lost Tomb of Jesus'' and ''The Jesus Family Tomb'', they read as follows:

* ''Yeshua bar Yehosef' -- [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] for "Jesus son of Joseph"
* ''Maria''—written in [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic script]], but a [[Latin]] form of the Hebrew name "Miriam" ("Mary")&lt;ref name=goodstein&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/27/us/27jesus.html?em&amp;ex=1172725200&amp;en=cf806e5e644ad636&amp;ei=5087%0A |title=Crypt Held Bodies of Jesus and Family, Film Says |last=Goodstein |first=Laurie |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=2007-02-27 |accessdate=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Yose''—a diminutive of "Joseph" mentioned (in its Greek form ιωσης "Joses") as the name of one of Jesus's brothers in the New Testament ({{bibleverse||Mark|6:3}})
* ''Yehuda bar Yeshua''—possibly Aramaic for "Judah son of Jesus"
* ''Mariamene e Mara''—according to the filmmakers this is [[Greek language|Greek]] for "Mary known as the master." The similar name "[[Mariamne (name)|Mariamne]]" is found in the [[Acts of Philip]]. Francois Bovon, professor of the history of religion at [[Harvard University]] has said, based on his study of that work, "I do not believe that Mariamne is the real name of Mary of Magdalene. Mariamne is, besides Maria or Mariam, a possible Greek equivalent, attested by Josephus, Origen, and the Acts of Philip, for the Semitic Myriam."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbl-site.org/publications/article.aspx?articleId=656 Letter to the Society of Biblical Literature, March 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Matya''—Hebrew for 'Matthew'—''not'' claimed to be [[Matthew the Evangelist]] but "possibly a husband of one of the women in an unmarked ossuary."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The filmmakers claim that there is evidence that Mary mother of Jesus had many relatives named Matthew.&lt;ref name="goodstein"/&gt;

The film further claims that the tenth ossuary, which went missing years ago, is the [[James Ossuary]] purported to contain the body of [[James the Just|James, the brother of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/tomb/explore/explore.html |title=The Lost Tomb of Jesus: Explore the Evidence |format=[[Adobe Flash]] |publisher=[[Discovery Channel]] |accessdate=2007-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227110330/http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/tomb/explore/explore.html |archivedate=2007-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Jesus Family Tomb]]'', [[Simcha Jacobovici]] claims the [[James Ossuary]] would have been a part of this tomb, but was removed by artifact dealers, and thus discovered separately (citation needed). The James Ossuary's authenticity has been called into question, and [[Oded Golan]], one of its past owners, was charged with fraud in connection to the artifact, but exonerated on all counts of forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Antiquities collector acquitted of forgery charges in 'James ossuary' case|url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/antiquities-collector-acquitted-of-forgery-charges-in-james-ossuary-case/article2368752/|website = The Globe and Mail|accessdate = 2015-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ben Witherington III]], who worked with Jacobovici on a Discovery Channel documentary on the James Ossuary, denies this connection on two grounds:
*"The James Ossuary, according to the report of the antiquities dealer that [[Oded Golan]] got the ossuary from, said that the ossuary came from [[Silwan]], not Talpiot, and had dirt in it that matched up with the soil in that particular spot in Jerusalem."
*"Furthermore, [[Eusebius]] reports that the tomb marker for James's burial was close to where James was martyred near the temple mount, indeed near the famous tombs in the [[Kidron Valley]] such as the so-called [[Yad Avshalom|Tomb of Absalom]]. Talpiot is nowhere near this locale."&lt;ref name=witherington&gt;{{cite web |url=http://benwitherington.blogspot.com/2007/02/jesus-tomb-titanic-talpiot-tomb-theory.html |title= The Jesus Tomb? 'Titanic' Talpiot Tomb Theory Sunk from the Start |last=Witherington |first=Ben |date=2007-02-26 |accessdate=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another consideration was that the measurements of the James Ossuary did not match the measurements listed for the tenth ossuary, which is no longer stored with the rest of the collection. The James Ossuary was listed as being approximately 50 centimeters (19.6 inches) long by 30 centimeters (11.8 inches) wide on one end, and 25.5 centimeters (10 inches) on the other end (citation needed). The tenth ossuary in the Talpiot collection is listed as 60 centimeters (23.6 inches) long by 26 centimeters (10.2 inches) by 30 centimeters (11.8 inches) (citation needed). Furthermore, Amos Kloner has stated that the tenth ossuary had no inscription.&lt;ref name=cnsnews/&gt; Also, Joe Zias, former curator of the [[Rockefeller Museum]] who received and catalogued the ossuaries, refuted this claim on his personal site (citation needed).

New information has now shown that the discrepancy in the measurements had to do with measuring the base of the ossuary, which is indeed 50 centimeters (19.6 inches), rather than the length. The top length of the James Ossuary, not the base, which is trapezoidal in shape, according to the latest re-measurement carried out by the Israel Antiquities Authority, is 57.5 centimeters (22.6 inches.) (citation needed). While compelling, this does not prove that the James Ossuary is the missing tenth Talpiot ossuary.

==DNA tests==
Analysis of [[mitochondrial DNA]] performed by [[Lakehead University]] on the remains found in the ossuary marked "Jesus son of Joseph" and the one marked "Mariamne" or "Mary" (who some claim to be Mary Magdalene) found that the two occupants were not blood relations on their mothers' side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/03/arts/television/03stan.html | work=New York Times | title=The Lost Tomb of Jesus | date=2007-03-03 | accessdate=2011-12-07 | first1=Alessandra | last1=Stanley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on these tests, the makers of the documentary suggest that "Jesus" and "Mariamne" were probably married "because otherwise they would not have been buried together in a family tomb,"&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0301/p13s02-lire.html?page=2 |title=Documentary examines supposed remains of Jesus |last=Goodstein |first=Laurie |publisher=''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' |date=2007-02-28 |accessdate=2007-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the remains were not dated using [[Carbon 14|radiocarbon]] to further sustain this supposition, neither was any announced DNA testing done on the others ossuaries to see if any familial relation existed there. Additionally, scholars argue the DNA tests only prove that they did not have the same mother and they could easily have been father/daughter, cousins, half brother/sister, or any number of possibilities that do not include a matrilineage line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbl-site.org/Article.aspx?ArticleId=649 Society of Biblical Literature&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The claim that Jesus was married also undermines the theological metaphor of the Church being the [[Bride of Christ (theology)|"Bride of Christ"]] (found in the writings of the New Testament). [[Jimmy Akin]], director of Apologetics and Evangelization at [[Catholic Answers]], wrote: "This image would never have arisen if there was a Mrs. Jesus living right there in Jerusalem…. We know about [the wives of religion founders] because they were honored figures as wives of The Founder, and if Jesus had a wife then (a) we would know about it and (b) the whole Church-as-the-Bride-of-Christ metaphor would never have come into existence." As for a possible "son of Jesus," he noted: "We tend to know about even the daughters of religious founders. Muhammad's daughter Fatima comes to mind. It would be much harder to sneak a forgotten son by the eyes of history…. It's not just hard to sneak sons past because patriarchal cultures focus more on sons; it's also because of this: In traditional societies, the son is looked on as the father's natural successor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jimmyakin.typepad.com/defensor_fidei/2007/03/tomb_of_jesus_n.html |first=Jimmy |last=Akin |title=The Tomb of Jesus Nonsense}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic views===

Finding someone's remains in Jesus' tomb conforms to the Muslim belief that a substitute for him was crucified, while he was raised bodily to heaven. The [[Islamic view of Jesus' death|Islamic view of his disappearance]], as mentioned in the Qur'an, states: ''That they said (in boast), "We killed Al-Masih 'Isa the son of Maryam, the Messenger of Allah"; but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quran.al-islam.com/Targama/dispTargam.asp?l=arb&amp;t=eng&amp;nType=1&amp;nSora=4&amp;nAya=157 Quran 4:157]&lt;/ref&gt; The general Muslim interpretation of the verse is that God, to revenge from Judas' betrayal to Jesus (the fatherless prophet), made his face similar to that of Jesus, while Jesus ascended into heaven and is to return near the end of time and kill the anti-Christ. Accordingly, the discovered remains in his tomb would then actually belong to Judas, a Roman guard, or a volunteering disciple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Reception==

Following the March 4, 2007, airing of ''The Lost Tomb of Jesus'' on the Discovery Channel, American journalist [[Ted Koppel]] aired a program entitled ''The Lost Tomb of Jesus—A Critical Look'', whose guests included the director [[Simcha Jacobovici]], [[James Tabor]], Chair of the Department of [[Religious Studies]] at the [[University of North Carolina at Charlotte]] who served as a consultant and advisor on the documentary, [[Jonathan Reed]], Professor of Religion at the [[University of LaVerne]] and co-author of ''Excavating Jesus Beneath the Stones, Behind the Text,'' and [[William G. Dever|William Dever]], an archaeologist with over 50 years experience in Middle Eastern archaeological digs.

Alan Cooperman, writer of ''The Washington Post'' article also states this: "Similar assessments came yesterday from two Israeli scholars, [[Amos Kloner]], who originally excavated the tomb, and [[Joe Zias]], former curator of archaeology at the [[Israeli Antiquities Authority]]. Kloner told the [[Jerusalem Post]] that the documentary is "nonsense." Zias described it in an e-mail to ''The Washington Post'' as a "hyped up film which is intellectually and scientifically dishonest."

Israeli archaeologist Amos Kloner, who was among the first to examine the tomb when it was first discovered, said the names marked on the coffins were very common at the time.
"I don't accept the news that it was used by Jesus or his family," and "The documentary filmmakers are using it to sell their film." he told the BBC News website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6397373.stm ''Jesus tomb found, says film-maker'']&lt;/ref&gt;

During the documentary ''The Lost Tomb of Jesus'', various professionals had claimed:

# concerning the ossuaries marked Yeshua` ("Jesus") and the one believed to be that of Mary Magdalene: because "the DNA did not match, the forensic archaeologist concluded that they must be husband and wife";
# that testing showed that there was a match between the patina on the James and Yeshua` ossuaries and referred to the James ossuary as the "missing link" from the tomb of Yeshua` (Jesus);
# and that an ossuary that became missing from the tomb of Yeshua` had actually been the infamous James ossuary believed to contain the remains of the brother of Yeshua`.

During Ted Koppel's critique, ''The Lost Tomb of Jesus—a Critical Look'', Koppel revealed he had denials from these three people that Simcha Jacobovici had misquoted in the documentary.

# Koppel had a written denial from the forensic archaeologist asserting that he had NOT concluded that the remains of Yeshua` and Miriamne showed they were husband and wife. In fact, he had logically stated, "you cannot genetically test for marriage."
# Koppel had a written denial from the [[Suffolk Crime Lab]] Director (Robert Genna) asserting that he had NOT stated the James ossuary patina matched that of the Yeshua` ossuary. He denied ever saying they were a match, and said he'd have to do much more comparison testing of other tombs before he could draw any conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Quarles, Charles ''Buried Hope or Risen Savior'' B&amp;H Publishing Group, 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4717-0}} p17 [https://books.google.com/books?id=OGwrSciQGvsC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=%22argument+goes+far+beyond+any+reasonable+interpretation%22++dever&amp;source=web&amp;ots=vD_dknXouO&amp;sig=vsVMwz7mWPk8ZMdyz-miq8ldbpI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Koppel had a verbal denial from Professor Amos Kloner, the archaeologist who had supervised the initial 1980 dig of the tomb of Yeshua`, with whom he spoke on 3/4/07, asserting that the ossuary that later turned up missing from the alleged Tomb of 'Jesus' could not have been what is now known as the James ossuary. In fact he indicated there was evidence that it was not the same by saying that the now missing ossuary he had seen and photographed and catalogued in 1980 had been totally unmarked, whereas the James ossuary is marked with the name of James and a rosette.

The archaeologist William Dever summed it up when he stated on Koppel's critical analysis, ''The Lost Tomb of Jesus—A Critical Look'', that Jacobovici's and Cameron's "conclusions were already drawn in the beginning" of the inquiry and that their "argument goes far beyond any reasonable interpretation."&lt;ref&gt;Quarles, Charles ''Buried Hope or Risen Savior'' B&amp;H Publishing Group, 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4717-0}} p.16 [https://books.google.com/books?id=OGwrSciQGvsC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=%22argument+goes+far+beyond+any+reasonable+interpretation%22++dever&amp;source=web&amp;ots=vD_dknXouO&amp;sig=vsVMwz7mWPk8ZMdyz-miq8ldbpI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological Questions==

===The Three Skulls===

Three skulls were found on the floor of the tomb in 1980 which the film makers assert was usual but others disagree: "This too was decidedly not typical. In ancient Jerusalem, the dead were placed inside tombs; in tombs, the dead were placed inside ossuaries. If anything was left behind, it was a lamp or a bottle of perfume, not skulls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official site quotation about the skulls.''|url=http://www.jesusfamilytomb.com/new_discoveries/the_chevron.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= ''Inside, they found 10 ossuaries and three skulls.''|url=https://www.thestar.com/article/185708 | work=The Star | location=Toronto | first=Stuart | last=Laidlaw | date=2007-02-26 | accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the documentary==
Early Christianity scholar [[R. Joseph Hoffmann]], chair of the Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion, says the film alerts the public to the fact that there are no secure conclusions when it comes to the foundational history of a religious tradition. But he charges that the film "is all about bad assumptions," beginning with the assumption that the boxes contain Jesus of Nazareth and his family. From his view as a historian specializing in the social history of earliest Christianity, he found it "amazing how evidence falls into place when you begin with the conclusion—and a hammer."&lt;ref&gt;"Who is Entombed in the 'Jesus Tomb'?" ''U.S. News,'' March 12, 2007, p. 34-35&lt;/ref&gt;

When interviewed about the upcoming documentary, [[Amos Kloner]], who oversaw the original archaeological dig of this tomb in 1980 said:
:"It makes a great story for a TV film, but it's completely impossible. It's nonsense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.townhall.com/Columnists/BrentBozellIII/2007/02/28/what_bones_of_jesus |last=Bozell |first=Brent |title=What Bones of Jesus? |publisher=Townhall.com |date=2007-02-28 |accessdate=2007-02-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302074621/http://www.townhall.com/columnists/BrentBozellIII/2007/02/28/what_bones_of_jesus |archive-date=2007-03-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Newsweek'' reports that the archaeologist who personally numbered the ossuaries dismissed any potential connection:
:"Simcha has no credibility whatsoever," says Joe Zias, who was the curator for anthropology and archeology at the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem from 1972 to 1997 and personally numbered the Talpiot ossuaries. "He's pimping off the Bible … He got this guy [[James Cameron|Cameron]], who made ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' or something like that—what does this guy know about archeology? I am an archeologist, but if I were to write a book about brain surgery, you would say, 'Who is this guy?' People want signs and wonders. Projects like these make a mockery of the archeological profession."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17328478/site/newsweek/ Have Researchers Found Jesus Christ's Tomb? - Newsweek Beliefs - MSNBC.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227105907/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17328478/site/newsweek/ |date=2007-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aforementioned Joe Zias has published in his own site a "viewers' guide" to the Talpiot Tomb documentary, in which he systematically rebuts the film's argumentation and gives much background information about the people involved in it.&lt;ref name=zias&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.joezias.com/tomb.html | title=Viewers Guide to Understanding the Talpiot Tomb 'documentary' | work=personal website | author = Joe Zias | date=2007-03-05 | accessdate=2007-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pfann also thinks the inscription read as "Jesus" has been misread and suggests that the name "Hanun" might be a more accurate rendering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/world/story/3894198p-4503665c.html |last=Matthews |first=Karen |title=Jesus tomb claim derided

''The Washington Post'' reports that [[William G. Dever]] (mentioned above as excavating ancient sites in Israel for 50 years) offered the following:
:"I've known about these ossuaries for many years and so have many other archaeologists, and none of us thought it was much of a story, because these are rather common Jewish names from that period. It's a publicity stunt, and it will make these guys very rich, and it will upset millions of innocent people because they don't know enough to separate fact from fiction."&lt;ref name=cooperman&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/26/AR2007022600442.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025143235/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/26/AR2007022600442.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-10-25 |title='Lost Tomb of Jesus' Claim Called a Stunt |last=Cooperman |first=Alan |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2007-02-28 |accessdate=2007-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Asbury Theological Seminary]]'s [[Ben Witherington III]] points out some other circumstantial problems with linking this tomb to Jesus' family:&lt;ref name=witherington /&gt;
* "So far as we can tell, the earliest followers of Jesus never called Jesus 'son of Joseph'. It was outsiders who mistakenly called him that."
* "The ancestral home of Joseph was Bethlehem, and his adult home was Nazareth. The family was still in Nazareth after he [Joseph] was apparently dead and gone. Why in the world would he be buried (alone at this point) in Jerusalem?"
* "One of the ossuaries has the name Jude son of Jesus. We have no historical evidence of such a son of Jesus, indeed we have no historical evidence he was ever married."
* "The Mary ossuaries (there are two) do not mention anyone from Migdal. It simply has the name Mary—and that's about the most common of all ancient Jewish female names."
* "We have names like Matthew on another ossuary, which don't match up with the list of [Jesus's] brothers' names."

The [[Archaeological Institute of America]], self-described on their website as "North America's oldest and largest organization devoted to the world of archeology," has published online their own criticism of the "Jesus tomb" claim: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"The identification of the Talpiyot tomb as the tomb of Jesus and his family is based on a string of problematic and unsubstantiated claims [...] [It] contradicts the canonical Gospel accounts of the death and burial of Jesus and the earliest Christian traditions about Jesus. This claim is also inconsistent with all of the available information—historical and archaeological—about how Jews in the time of Jesus buried their dead, and specifically the evidence we have about poor, non-Judean families like that of Jesus. It is a sensationalistic claim without any scientific basis or support."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeological.org/webinfo.php?page=10408 AIA News - Has the Tomb of Jesus Been Discovered?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307084558/http://www.archaeological.org/webinfo.php?page=10408 |date=2007-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===DNA and family evidence===

[[Darrell Bock]], a New Testament scholar and research professor of New Testament studies at [[Dallas Theological Seminary]] points out some of the inconsistencies, including: "If Jesus' family came from [[Galilee]], why would they have a family tomb in Jerusalem?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dev.bible.org/bock/node/107 |title=No Need to Yell, Only a Challenge for Some who Need to Step Up and Could (expanded) |date=2007-02-27 |accessdate=2007-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304220146/http://dev.bible.org/bock/node/107 |archivedate=2007-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ben Witherington]] points out an inconsistency related to the [[James Ossuary]]. He points out that the James Ossuary came from [[Silwan]], not [[Talpiot]]. In addition, the James Ossuary had dirt on it that "matched up with the soil in that particular spot in Jerusalem." In his opinion, this is problematic, because "the ossuaries that came out of Talpiot came out of a rock cave from a different place, and without such soil in it." Therefore, he believes that it is difficult to believe that the one known family member of Jesus was buried separately and far away from Jesus' family.&lt;ref name=witherington /&gt;

In addition, during the trial of antiquities dealer Oded Golan there has been testimony from former [[FBI]] agent Gerald Richard that a photo of the James ossuary, showing it in Golan's home, was taken in the 1970s, based on tests done by the FBI photo lab. This would make it impossible for the James Ossuary to have been discovered with the rest of the Talpiot ossuaries in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="laidlaw"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/News/article/185708 |title=Jesus tomb claim sparks furor |last=Laidlaw |first=Stuart |publisher=[[Toronto Star]] |date=2007-02-26 |accessdate=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With reference to the DNA tests, Witherington wrote in his blog: "[T]he most the DNA evidence can show is that several of these folks are interrelated…. We would need an independent control sample from some member of Jesus' family to confirm that these were members of Jesus' family. We do not have that at all."&lt;ref name=witherington /&gt; This quote clarifies the fact that the documentarians do not believe they have tested the DNA and have proven it to be Jesus. They simply used DNA testing to prove that the "Jesus son of Joseph" and the "Mariamne" in this tomb were not maternally related (i.e. that they did not have the same mother or grandmother). The film asserted that this DNA evidence suggests they were probably spouses. Critics contend they could have been paternally related (e.g. father and daughter, or grandfather and granddaughter), or related by someone else's marriage. Mariamne could just as well have been the wife of one of the other two males in the ossuary.

''[[The New York Times]]'' article of February 27, 2007, ([http://www.heraldtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070227/ZNYT02/702270730/-1/ZNYT reprinted in full on many websites)] states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The documentary's director and its driving force, Simcha Jacobovici…, said there was enough mitochondrial DNA for a laboratory in Ontario to conclude that the bodies in the "Jesus" and "Mary Magdalene" ossuaries were not related on their mothers' side. From this, Mr. Jacobovici deduced that they were a couple, because otherwise they would not have been buried together in a family tomb. In an interview, Mr. Jacobovici was asked why the filmmakers did not conduct DNA testing on the other ossuaries to determine whether the one inscribed Judah, son of Jesus was genetically related to either the Jesus or Mary Magdalene boxes; or whether the Jesus remains were actually the offspring of Mary. "We're not scientists. At the end of the day we can't wait till every ossuary is tested for DNA," he said. "We took the story that far. At some point you have to say, I've done my job as a journalist."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the televised debate following the airing of the film, Ted Koppel pressed Jacobovici on the same question and received the same response. According to the authors of one [http://jesus-crypt-fraud.blogspot.com/ blog], "the response is manifestly disingenuous. The question, in fact, necessarily arises whether the team or one of its members decided not to proceed with any further DNA tests. Such tests may have revealed that none of the ossuaries are related—hence defeating the underlying presupposition that the crypt was in fact a family tomb, and thereby eliminating any valid basis at all for producing and showing the film."

[[William G. Dever]] said that some of the inscriptions on the ossuaries are unclear, but that all of the names are common. "I've known about these ossuaries for many years and so have many other archaeologists, and none of us thought it was much of a story because these are rather common Jewish names from that period. It's a publicity stunt, and it will make these guys very rich, and it will upset millions of innocent people because they don't know enough to separate fact from fiction."&lt;ref name=cooperman /&gt;

Jodi Magness, an archaeologist at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, notes that at the time of Jesus, wealthy families buried their dead in tombs cut by hand from solid rock, putting the bones in niches in the walls and then, later, transferring them to ossuaries. "If Jesus' family had been wealthy enough to afford a rock-cut tomb, it would have been in Nazareth, not Jerusalem," Magness writes.

According to Magness, the names on the Talpiot ossuaries indicate that the tomb belonged to a family from Judea, the area around Jerusalem, where people were known by their first name and father's name. As Galileans, Jesus and his family members would have used their first name and hometown. "This whole case (for the tomb of Jesus) is flawed from beginning to end."&lt;ref name=cooperman /&gt;

There is no information on analyzing relation of "Mary" and "Jesus son of Joseph" or any other tomb occupants. In Jewish tradition of the time, after one year, when bodies in rock-cut tombs were decomposed, bones were collected, cleaned and then finally placed in an [[ossuary]]. Due to this conduct there is no real assurance that what scientists have really examined are remnants of "Mariamne e Mara" and "Jesus son of Joseph."

===Interpretation of the inscriptions===

David Mavorah, a curator of the [[Israel Museum]] in Jerusalem, points out that the names on the ossuaries were extremely common. "We know that Joseph, Jesus and Mariamne were all among the most common names of the period. To start with all these names being together in a single tomb and leap from there to say this is the tomb of Jesus is a little far-fetched, to put it politely."&lt;ref name=pilkington&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/religion/Story/0,,2022252,00.html |title=Is this really the last resting place of Jesus, Mary Magdalene—and their son? |last=Pilkington |first=Ed |author2=McCarthy, Rory  |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=2007-02-27 |accessdate=2007-02-28 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Mavorah is an expert of Israeli Antiquity, and (presumably) not an expert of statistics. However, Andrey Feuerverger, the statistician cited by the makers of the documentary, has said that determination of the identity of those in the tomb was the purview of biblical historians, and not statisticians. For another interpretation of the statistics see the [[The Lost Tomb of Jesus#Statistical report|statistics section above]].

Professor Amos Kloner, former Jerusalem district archaeologist of the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] and the first archaeologist to examine the tomb in 1980,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070227/FEATURES/302270010 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120526032109/http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070227/FEATURES/302270010 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-05-26 |title=Clergy, scholars assail tomb of Jesus film |publisher=The Courier-Journal |date=2007-02-27 |accessdate=2007-02-27}} &lt;/ref&gt; told the ''[[Yedioth Ahronoth]]'' newspaper that the name Jesus had been found 71 times in burial caves at around that time.&lt;ref name=pilkington /&gt; Furthermore, he said that the inscription on the ossuary is not clear enough to ascertain, and although the idea fails to hold up by archaeological standards it makes for profitable television. Quote: "The new evidence is not serious, and I do not accept that it is connected to the family of Jesus…. They just want to get money for it."&lt;ref name=goodstein /&gt;

[[Richard Bauckham]], professor at the [[University of St Andrews]], catalogued ossuary names from that region since 1980. He records that based on the catalogue, "Jesus" was the 6th most popular name of Jewish men, and "Mary/Mariamne" was the single most popular name of Jewish women at that time. Therefore, finding two ossuaries containing the names "Jesus" and "Mary/Mariamne" is not significant at all, and the chances of it being the ossuaries of Jesus and Mary Magdalene are "very small indeed."&lt;ref name=hollywood&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dev.bible.org/bock/node/106 |title=Hollywood Hype: The Oscars and Jesus' Family Tomb, What Do They Share? (expanded version) |date=2007-02-26 |accessdate=2007-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302073737/http://dev.bible.org/bock/node/106 |archivedate=2007-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning the inscription attributed to Jesus son of Joseph, Steve Caruso, a professional Aramaic translator using a computer to visualize different interpretations, claims that although it is ''possible'' to read it as "Yeshua" that "overall it is a very strong possibility that this inscription is not &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Yeshua` bar Yehosef''.'"&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The name "Mary" and its derivatives may have been used by up to 25% of Jewish women at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garyhabermas.com/articles/The_Lost_Tomb_of_Jesus/losttombofjesus_response.htm "The Lost Tomb of Jesus: A Response to the Discovery-Channel Documentary Directed by James Cameron"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publicity===
[[Lawrence Stager|Lawrence E. Stager]], the Dorot professor of archaeology of Israel at [[Harvard]], said the documentary was "exploiting the whole trend that caught on with ''[[The Da Vinci Code]].'' One of the problems is there are so many biblically illiterate people around the world that they don't know what is real judicious assessment and what is what some of us in the field call 'fantastic archaeology.'"&lt;ref name=goodstein /&gt;

[[William G. Dever]] said, "I'm not a Christian. I'm not a believer. I don't have a dog in this fight. I just think it's a shame the way this story is being hyped and manipulated."&lt;ref name=cooperman /&gt;

Jodi Magness criticized the decision of the documentary makers to make their claims at a news conference rather than in a peer-reviewed scientific article. By going directly to the media, she said, the filmmakers "have set it up as if it's a legitimate academic debate, when the vast majority of scholars who specialize in archeology of this period have flatly rejected this."&lt;ref name=cooperman /&gt;

Joe Zias, former curator of archeology at the Israeli Antiquities Authority, described it in an e-mail to ''The Washington Post'' as a "hyped-up film which is intellectually and scientifically dishonest."&lt;ref name=cooperman /&gt; He also wrote an extended Viewers Guide to Understanding the Talpiot Tomb documentary, published on his web site.&lt;ref name=zias /&gt;
[[François Bovon]] has also written to say that his comments were misused. In a letter to the Society of Biblical Literature, he wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbl-site.org/Article.aspx?ArticleId=656 |title=Society of Biblical Literature }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
As I was interviewed for the Discovery Channel's program The Lost Tomb of Jesus, I would like to express my opinion here.

First, I have now seen the program and am not convinced of its main thesis. When I was questioned by Simcha Jacobovici and his team the questions were directed toward the Acts of Philip and the role of Mariamne in this text. I was not informed of the whole program and the orientation of the script.

Second, having watched the film, in listening to it, I hear two voices, a kind of double discourse. On one hand there is the wish to open a scholarly discussion; on the other there is the wish to push a personal agenda. I must say that the reconstructions of Jesus' marriage with Mary Magdalene and the birth of a child belong for me to science fiction.

Third, to be more credible, the program should deal with the very ancient tradition of the Holy Sepulcher, since the emperor Constantine in the fourth century C.E. built this monument on the spot at which the emperor Hadrian in the second century C.E. erected the forum of Aelia Capitolina and built on it a temple to Aphrodite at the place where Jesus' tomb was venerated.

Fourth, I do not believe that Mariamne is the real name of Mary of Magdalene. Mariamne is, besides Maria or Mariam, a possible Greek equivalent, attested by Josephus, Origen, and the Acts of Philip, for the Semitic Myriam.

Fifth, the Mariamne of the Acts of Philip is part of the apostolic team with Philip and Bartholomew; she teaches and baptizes. In the beginning, her faith is stronger than Philip's faith. This portrayal of Mariamne fits very well with the portrayal of Mary of Magdala in the Manichean Psalms, the Gospel of Mary, and Pistis Sophia. My interest is not historical, but on the level of literary traditions. I have suggested this identification in 1984 already in an article of New Testament Studies.

====Symposium and media coverage====

Following a symposium at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] in January 2008 media interest in the Talpiot tomb was reignited. ''[[Time magazine|Time]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1704299,00.html | work=Time | title=Jesus 'Tomb' Controversy Reopened | date=2008-01-16 | accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[CNN]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/world/2008/01/18/wedeman.revisiting.jesus.tomb.cnn | work=CNN | title= Video | accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; devoted extensive coverage, implying that the case had been re-opened.

Scholars who had been present at the symposium then accused Jacobovici and Cameron of misleading the media in claiming the symposium reopened their theory as viable. Several scholars, including all the archaeologists and epigraphers, who delivered papers at the symposium issued an open letter of complaint claiming misrepresentation, saying that Jacobovici and Cameron's claims of support from the symposium are "nothing further from the truth".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dukereligion.blogspot.com/2008/01/talpiot-tomb-controversy-revisited.html Duke University Religion Department: The Talpiot Tomb Controversy Revisited&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Twentieth Century Society''' ('''C20''') is a British [[Charitable organization|charity]] which campaigns for the [[Historic preservation|preservation]] of [[architectural]] heritage from 1914 onwards.&lt;ref name="C20about"&gt;{{cite web |title=About us |publisher=Twentieth Century Society |url=http://www.c20society.org.uk/about-us/ |accessdate=25 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The society's interests embrace buildings and artefacts that characterise 20th-century Britain.&lt;ref name="C20about"/&gt; It is formally recognised as one of the [[Amenity society|National Amenity Societies]], and as such is a statutory consultee on alterations to [[listed building]]s within its period of interest, and must be notified of any proposed work to a listed building which involves any element of demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=[[Department for Communities and Local Government]] |title=Arrangements for handling heritage applications Direction 2015 |publisher=www.gov.uk |date=24 March 2015 |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/arrangements-for-handling-heritage-applications-direction-2015 |accessdate=5 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The society was formed as The Thirties Society in 1979, the year in which the prominent "Thirties – British art and design before the War" exhibition was shown at the [[Hayward Gallery]].&lt;ref name=c20history&gt;{{cite web |first1=Gavin |last1=Stamp |authorlink1=Gavin Stamp |first2=Alan |last2=Powers |authorlink2=Alan Powers |title=A Brief History |publisher=Twentieth Century Society |url=http://www.c20society.org.uk/about-us/ |accessdate=25 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its establishment was inspired by and loosely modelled on the [[Victorian Society]], which aims to protect pre-1914 Victorian and Edwardian buildings. [[Bevis Hillier]] was the first president, and [[Clive Aslet]] the first honorary secretary.&lt;ref name=c20history/&gt; In 1992, the society changed its name to The Twentieth Century Society, as it was felt that "Thirties Society" failed to indicate its interest in the protection of buildings from other periods as well.&lt;ref name=c20history/&gt;

==Notable cases and campaigns==
*The catalyst for establishing the society in 1979 was the proposal to replace Sir [[Edwin Cooper (architect)|Edwin Cooper]]'s classical 1928 building for [[Lloyds of London]] with a new building by [[Richard Rogers]]. The society's protests were too late, and Rogers' [[Lloyd's building]] was completed in 1986 (and was itself [[listed building|listed]] Grade I in 2011).&lt;ref name=c20history/&gt;
*The society's first serious high-profile case was that of the [[Art Deco]] [[Firestone tyre factory]] of 1928 on the [[Golden Mile (Brentford)|Great West Road]] in West London. The building was demolished by its owners over a [[bank holiday]] weekend in August 1980 in anticipation of its being listed.&lt;ref name=c20history/&gt;
*In 1985–6 the society campaigned against the wholesale replacement of the traditional K-series [[red telephone box]]es designed by Sir [[Giles Gilbert Scott]] between 1926 and 1936. The campaign attracted much public support, and led to a number of boxes being listed.&lt;ref name=c20history/&gt;
*In 1987, the society successfully campaigned for the listing of [[Bracken House, London]], the former home of the ''[[Financial Times]]'', designed by Sir [[Albert Richardson]] and built between 1955 and 1958. This was the first post-[[Second World War]] building to be listed, the previous cut-off date having been 1939.&lt;ref name=c20history/&gt; 
*In 1993–4, the society successfully persuaded the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] to take into care and open to the public [[2 Willow Road]], [[Hampstead]], completed in 1939, and designed by the Hungarian architect [[Ernő Goldfinger]] for his own occupation.&lt;ref name="C20about"/&gt; 
* In the 1980s and 1990s the society campaigned repeatedly for the preservation and listing of [[Bankside Power Station]], designed by Sir [[Giles Gilbert Scott]], constructed in two phases in 1947–52 and 1958–63, and decommissioned in 1981. The campaign was ultimately successful, and the building reopened as the [[Tate Modern]] art gallery in 2000.&lt;ref name="C20about"/&gt;

Universal history embraces the events of all times and nations in so far as [[Scientific method|scientific treatment]] of them is possible.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold von Ranke. ''Universal history: the oldest historical group of nations and the Greeks''. Scribner, 1884.
''An epitome of universal history'' by A. Harding. Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Universal history in the Western tradition is commonly divided into three parts, viz. [[Ancient history|ancient]], [[Postclassical Era|medieval]], and [[Modern history|modern]] time.&lt;ref name="EoUHfHIiRafSI"&gt;H. M. Cottinger. [https://books.google.com/books?id=DkVDAAAAIAAJ Elements of universal history for higher institutes in republics and for self-instruction]. [[Charles H. Whiting]], 1884. pg. [https://books.google.com/books?id=DkVDAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 1]+.&lt;/ref&gt; The division on ancient and medieval periods is less sharp or absent in the Arabic and Asian historiographies. A synoptic view of universal history led some scholars, beginning with [[Karl Jaspers]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Origin and Goal of History'', (London: Yale University Press, 1949).&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish the [[Axial Age]] synchronous to "classical antiquity" of the Western tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel N. Eisenstadt, ''Axial Age Civilizations'', (New York: New York State University Press, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; Jaspers also proposed a more universal periodization—prehistory, history and planetary history. All distinguished earlier periods belong to the second period (history) which is a relatively brief transitory phase between two much longer periods.

The roots of [[historiography]] in the 19th century are bound up with the concept that history written with a strong connection to the [[primary source]]s could [[Research|be integrated]] with "the big picture", i.e. to a general, universal history. For example, [[Leopold von Ranke]], probably the pre-eminent historian of the 19th century, founder of '''Rankean historical positivism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zubin Meer (ed.), ''Individualism: The Cultural Logic of Modernity'', Lexington Books, 2011, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;, the classic mode of historiography that now stands against [[postmodernism]], attempted to write a Universal History at the close of his career. The works of world historians [[Oswald Spengler]] and [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] are examples of attempts to integrate primary [[Source text|source-based]] history and Universal History. Spengler's work is more general; Toynbee created a theory that would allow the study of "civilizations" to proceed with integration of [[Recorded history|source-based history writing]] and Universal History writing.&lt;ref&gt;Donald A. Yerxa. ''Recent Themes in World History and the History of the West: Historians in Conversation''. Univ of South Carolina Press, 2009. Page 1+&lt;/ref&gt; Both writers attempted to incorporate [[teleology|teleological theories]] into general presentations of the history. Toynbee found as the ''telos'' (''goal'') of universal history the emergence of a single [[World State]].

==Instances and description==

===Ancient examples===

====Hebrew Bible====
A project of Universal history may be seen in the [[Hebrew Bible]],{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} 
which from the point of view of its redactors{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} in the 5th century BC presents a history of humankind from [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] to the [[Noah's flood|Flood]], 
and from there a history of the [[Israelites]] down to [[Second Temple Judaism|the present]]. The [[Seder Olam Rabbah|Seder Olam]] is a 2nd-century CE rabbinic interpretation of this chronology.

====Greco-Roman historiography====
{{main article|Greco-Roman historiography}}
In [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman antiquity]], the first universal history was written by [[Ephorus]] ([[Floruit|fl.]] 4th century BC).  This work has been lost, but its influence can be seen in the ambitions of [[Polybius]] (203–120 BC) and [[Diodorus]] ([[Floruit|fl.]] 1st century BC) to give comprehensive accounts of their worlds. [[Herodotus]]' ''History'' is the earliest surviving member of the Greco-Roman world-historical tradition, although under some definitions of universal history it does not qualify as universal because it reflects no attempt to describe an overall direction of history or a principle or set of principles governing or underlying it.  Polybius was the first to attempt a universal history in this stricter sense of the term:
{{quote|
For what gives my work its peculiar quality, and what is most remarkable in the present age, is this: Fortune has gained almost all the affairs of the world in one direction and has forced to incline towards one and the same end; a historian should likewise bring before his readers under one synoptic view the operations by which she has accomplished her general purpose (1:4:1-11).}}
''[[Metamorphoses]]'' by [[Ovid]] has been considered as a universal history because of its comprehensive chronology—from the [[Cosmogony|creation of mankind]] to the death of [[Julius Caesar]] a year before the poet's birth.&lt;ref name="Solodow 1988, p. 18."&gt;{{cite book|last=Solodow|first=Joseph B.|title=The World of Ovid's Metamorphoses|year=1988|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|isbn=9780807817711|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=n0vdulnvcvoC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=sources+for+ovid%27s+metamorphoses&amp;ots=9nFm-L-j6b&amp;sig=u0-D_k9Ytxi_hf3R6Df9WLImfw0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Leipziger Weltchronik|Leipzig]] are preserved five fragments dating to the 2nd century AD and coming from a world chronicle. Its author is unknown, but was perhaps a Christian. Later, universal history provided an influential lens on the rise of Christianity in the Roman Empire in such works as [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]]'s ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'', [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]'s ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'', and [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]' ''History Against the Pagans''.

====Chinese historiography====
During the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BCE&amp;nbsp;– 220 CE) of [[China]], [[Sima Qian]] (145–86 BC) was the first Chinese historian to attempt a universal history—from the earliest [[Chinese mythology|mythological origins]] of his civilization to [[History of the Han Dynasty|his present day]]—in his ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]''. Although his generation was the first in China to discover the existence of kingdoms in [[Central Asia]] and [[India]], his work did not attempt to cover the history of these regions.

===Medieval examples===

====Western Europe====
The ''universal [[chronicle]]'' traces history from the beginning of the world up to the present and was an especially popular genre of [[historiography]] in [[medieval]] [[Western Europe]]. The universal chronicle differs from the ordinary chronicle in its much broader chronological and geographical scope, giving, in principle, a continuous account of the progress of world history from the creation of the world up to the author's own times, but in practice often narrowing down to a more limited geographical range as it approaches those times.

The [[Chronicon (Eusebius)|''Chronica'']] of [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] (c. 275–339) is considered to be the starting point of this tradition. The second book of this work consisted of a set of concordance tables (''Chronici canones'') that for the first time synchronized the several concurrent chronologies in use with different peoples. Eusebius' chronicle became known to the [[Latin]] West through the translation by [[Jerome]] (c. 347–420).

Universal chronicles are sometimes organized around a central [[ideological]] theme, such as the [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] idea of the tension between the heavenly and the earthly state, as depicted in the [[City of God (book)|City of God]], which plays a major role in [[Otto von Freising]]'s ''Historia de duabus civitatibus''. Agustine’s thesis depicts the history of the world as universal warfare between God and the Devil. This metaphysical war is not limited by time but only by geography as it takes place on planet Earth. In this war God moves (by divine intervention/ Providence) those governments, political /ideological movements and military forces aligned (or aligned the most) with the Catholic Church (the City of God)  in order to oppose by all means—including military—those governments, political/ideological movements and military forces aligned (or aligned the most) with the Devil (the City of Devil).

In other cases, any obvious theme may be lacking. Some universal chronicles bear a more or less [[encyclopedia|encyclopedic]] character, with many digressions on non-historical subjects, as is the case with the ''Chronicon'' of [[Helinand of Froidmont]].

Other notable universal chroniclers of the Medieval West include [[Bede]] (c. 672 or 673–735), the [[Christherre-Chronik]], [[Helinand of Froidmont]] (c. 1160—after 1229), [[Isidore of Seville]] (c. 560–636), [[Jans der Enikel]], [[Matthew Paris]] (c. 1200-1259), [[Ranulf Higdon]] (c. 1280-1363), [[Rudolf von Ems]], [[Sigebert of Gembloux]] (c. 1030–1112), [[Otto von Freising]] (c. 1114–1158), and [[Vincent of Beauvais]] (c. 1190-1264?).

The tradition of universal history can even be seen in the works of medieval historians whose purpose may not have been to chronicle the ancient past, but nonetheless included it in a local history of more recent times.  One such example is the ''[[Decem Libri Historiarum]]'' of [[Gregory of Tours]] (d. 594), where only the first of his ten books describes creation and ancient history, while the last six books focus on events in his own lifetime and region.  While this reading of Gregory is currently a widely accepted hypothesis in historical circles, the central purpose of Gregory's writing is still a topic of hot debate.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Ian. Gregory of Tours. (Bangor: Headstart History, 1994.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Kathleen and Wood, Ian, eds.. The World of Gregory of Tours. (Boston: Brill, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Historiography of early Islam====
{{main article|Historiography of early Islam}}
In the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] (13th century), universal history in this vein was taken up by [[Historiography of early Islam|Muslim historians]] such as [[Tarikh-i Jahangushay-i Juvaini]] ("The History of The World Conqueror") by [[Ala'iddin Ata-Malik Juvayni]], [[Jami al-Tawarikh]] ("Compendium of Chronicles") by [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]] (now held at the [[University of Edinburgh]]) and the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' by Ibn Khaldun.

===Modern historiography===
{{rquote|right|A philosophical attempt to work out a universal history according to a natural plan directed to achieving the civic union of the human race must be regarded as possible and, indeed, as contributing to this end of Nature|[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] - Ninth Thesis&lt;ref&gt;Idea for a Universal History from a Cosmopolitan Point of View&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An early European project was the ''[[Universal History (Sale et al)|Universal History]]'' of [[George Sale]] and others, written in the mid-18th century.

Christian writers as late as [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet|Bossuet]] in his ''Discours sur l'histoire universelle''  ([[Speech of Universal History]]) are still reflecting on and continuing the Medieval tradition of universal history.&lt;ref&gt;Bossuet, J. B. ''[https://archive.org/details/discourssurlhist01boss Discours sur l'histoire universelle] (Paris, Furne et cie, 1853).&lt;/ref&gt;
Speech of Universal History is considered by many Catholics as an actual second edition or continuation of the [[City of God (book)|City of God]]. In this work Bossuet continues to provide an update of universal history according to Augustine’s thesis of universal war between those humans that follow God and those who follow the Devil. This concept of world history guided by [[Divine Providence]] in a universal war between God and Devil is part of the official doctrine of the Catholic Church as most recently stated in the [[Second Vatican Council|Second Vatican Council']] s [[Gaudium et Spes]] document: "The Church . . . holds that in her most benign Lord and Master can be found the key, the focal point and the goal of man, as well as of all human history...all of human life, whether individual or collective, shows itself to be a dramatic struggle between good and evil, between light and darkness...The Lord is the goal of human history the focal point of the longings of history and of civilization, the center of the human race, the joy of every heart and the answer to all its yearnings."

In the 19th century, universal histories proliferated.{{dubious|date=April 2015}}
&lt;!--a "general theory of history" is not a "universal history". entirely different topic. But there is much overlapping between the two and universal history can be based on theory of history--&gt;
Philosophers such as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]],&lt;ref&gt;"[[Idea for a Universal History with a Cosmopolitan Purpose]]" in On History, (tr. Lewis White Beck, Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merill Co, 1963).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herder]],&lt;ref&gt;''Universal History'', (tr. F. Wilson, New York: 1953).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Schiller]] and [[Hegel]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Philosophy of History'', (tr. Robert S. Hartman, Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merill Co, 1956).&lt;/ref&gt; and political philosophers such as [[Marx]] and [[Herbert Spencer]], presented general theories of history that shared essential characteristics with the Biblical account: they conceived of history as a coherent whole, governed by certain basic characteristics or immutable principles. Kant who was one of the earliest thinkers to use the term ''Universal History'' described its meaning in "[[Idea for a Universal History with a Cosmopolitan Purpose]]":
{{quote|
Whatever concept one may hold...concerning the freedom of the will, certainly its appearances, which are human actions, like every other natural event are determined by universal laws. However obscure their causes, history...permits us to hope that if we attend to the play of freedom of the human will in the large, we may be able to discern a regular movement in it, and that what seems complex and chaotic in the single individual may be seen from the standpoint of the human race as a whole to b a steady and progressive though slow evolution of the original endowment..Each individual and people, as if following some guiding trend, goes toward a natural but to each of them unknown goal...In keeping with this purpose, it might be possible to have a history with a definite natural plan for creatures that have no plan of their own.&lt;ref&gt;On History, (tr. Lewis White Beck, Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merill Co, 1963, p 11-12); also ''Perpetual Peace'' in: Ibid., (p 106).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Bronze Age]] forms part of the [[three-age system]]. In this system, it follows the [[Neolithic Age]] in some areas of the world. In the 24th century BC, the [[Akkadian Empire]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/nt/Gilgamesh/akkadian.html akkadian]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wells, H. G. (1921). [https://books.google.com/books?id=rTAMAAAAIAAJ&amp;client=firefox-a The outline of history, being a plain history of life and mankind] New York: Macmillan company. Page 137.&lt;/ref&gt; was founded. The [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt]] (c. 22nd century BC) was followed by the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]] between the 21st to 17th centuries BC. The [[Sumerian Renaissance]] also developed c. 21st century BC. Around the 18th century BC, the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt]] began. By 1600 BC, [[Mycenaean Greece]] developed, the beginning of the [[Shang Dynasty]] in China emerged and there was evidence of a fully developed [[Chinese writing system]]. Also around 1600 BC, the beginning of [[Hittites|Hittite]] dominance of the Eastern [[Mediterranean]] region is seen. From the 16th to 11th centuries BC the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]] dominated the Nile Valley. Between 1550 BC and 1292 BC, the [[Amarna Period]] developed.

The [[Iron Age]] is the last principal period in the three-age system, preceded by the Bronze Age. Its date and context vary depending on the country or geographical region.
During the 13th to 12th centuries BC, the [[Ramesside Period]] occurred in Egypt. Around c. 1200 BC, the [[Trojan War]] was thought to have taken place.&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Barry S. (2006) The Trojan War: A New History. Simon &amp; Schuster {{ISBN|0-7432-6442-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; By c. 1180 BC, the disintegration of the [[Hittite Empire]] was underway.

In 1046 BC, the Zhou force, led by [[King Wu of Zhou]], overthrows the last king of the Shang Dynasty. The [[Zhou Dynasty]] is established in China shortly thereafter. In 1000 BC, the [[Mannaeans]] Kingdom begins in [[Western Asia]]. Around the 10th to 7th centuries BC, the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] forms in [[Mesopotamia]]. In 800 BC, the rise of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] city-states begins. In 776 BC, the first recorded [[Olympic Games]] are held.

{{Main article|Post-classical era}}

The [[post-classical era]], also known as the Middle Ages,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_world_in_the_Middle_Ages.html?id=U1sMAAAAYAAJ The World in the Middle Ages: An Historical Geography, with Accounts of the Origin and Development, the Institutions and Literature, the Manners and Customs of the Nations in Europe, Western Asia, and Northern Africa, from the Close of the Fourth to the Middle of the Fifteenth Century]. [[Adolphus Louis Koeppen]].&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[historical]] [[Periodization|period]] following the [[Iron Age]], fully underway by the 5th century and lasting to the 15th century, and preceding the [[early Modern Era]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Tabular_Views_of_Universal_History.html?id=7jtHAAAAIAAJ Tabular Views of Universal History]. [[George Haven Putnam]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emma Willard. A system of universal history, in perspective: accompanied by an atlas, exhibiting chronology in a picture of nations, and progressive geography in a series of maps. F. J. Huntington, 1835. Page [https://books.google.com/books?id=x9gEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR5-IA3 3]&lt;/ref&gt; The medieval&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Lang-la|medius}} + {{Lang-la|aevum}} (middle + age); See [[Centre (geometry)|Middle]] and [[Time|Age]].&lt;/ref&gt; history is the middle period, or the middle age, in a three-period division of history: [[Ancient History|Classic]], Medieval,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and [[Modern history|Modern]]. The precise dates of the beginning, culmination, and end of the medieval history are more or less arbitrarily assumed according to the point of view adopted. Any hard and fast line drawn to designate either the beginning or close of the period in question is arbitrary. The widest limits given, viz., the irruption of the Visigoths over the boundaries of the Roman Empire, for the beginning, and the Middle Ages of the 16th century, for the close, may be taken as inclusively sufficient, and embrace, beyond dispute, every movement or phase of history that can be claimed as properly belonging to the medieval history.

In Europe, the period saw the large-scale [[Migration Period|European Migration]] and [[Decline of the Roman Empire|fall of the Western Roman Empire]]. In South Asia, the [[middle kingdoms of India]] were the classical period of the region. The "Medieval" period on the Indian subcontinent lasts for some 1,500 years, and ends in the 13th century. During the late medieval history, [[Islamic empires in India|several Islamic empires]] were established in the Indian subcontinent. In East Asia, the [[Mid-Imperial China]] age begins with the reunification of China and ends with China was conquered by the [[Mongol Empire]]. The [[Golden Horde]] invaded North and West Asia and parts of eastern Europe in the 13th century and established and maintained their [[khanate]] until the end of the medieval history.

The Early medieval history saw the continuation of trends set up in [[ancient history]] (and, for Europe, [[late Antiquity]]). The period is usually considered to open with those migrations of the German Tribes which led to the destruction of the Roman Empire in the West in 375, when the Huns fell upon the Gothic tribes north of the Black Sea and forced the Visigoths over the boundaries of the Roman Empire on the lower Danube. A later date, however, is sometimes assumed, viz., when Odoacer deposed Romulus Augustulus, the last of the Roman Emperors of the West, in 476.  Depopulation, deurbanization, and increased [[barbarian]] invasion were seen across the [[Old World]]. [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]], once part of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], became [[Islamic]]. Later in [[European history]], the establishment of the [[feudal system]] allowed a return to systemic agriculture. There was sustained [[urbanization]] in [[Northern Europe|northern]] and [[western Europe]].

During the High medieval history in Europe, [[Christian]]-oriented art and architecture flourished and [[Crusades]] were mounted to recapture the [[Holy Land]] from [[Muslim]] control. The influence of the emerging states in Europe was tempered by the ideal of an international [[Christendom]]. The codes of [[chivalry]] and [[courtly love]] set rules for proper European behavior, while the European [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosophers attempted to reconcile Christian faith and reason.

During the Late medieval history in Europe, the centuries of prosperity and growth came to a halt.
The close of the medieval history is also variously fixed; some make it coincide with the rise of Humanism and the Renaissance in Italy, in the 14th century; with the Fall of Constantinople, in 1453; with the discovery of America by Columbus in 1492; or, again, with the great religious schism of the 16th century. A series of famines and plagues, such as the [[medieval Great Famine]] and the [[Black Death]], reduced the population around half before the calamities in the late medieval history. Along with depopulation came social unrest and endemic warfare. Western Europe experienced serious peasant risings: the [[Jacquerie]], the [[Peasants' Revolt]], and the [[Hundred Years' War]]. To add to the many problems of the period, the unity of the Catholic Church was shattered by the [[Western Schism]]. Collectively the events are a [[crisis of the Late Middle Ages|crisis of the Late medieval history]].

[[Modern history]] describes the historical period after the Middle history.&lt;ref&gt;Intrinsic to the English language, "modern" denotes (in reference to history) a period that is opposed to either ancient or medieval&amp;nbsp;— modern history comprising the history of the world since the close of the Middle history.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LaNDmZBcNGQC&amp;pg=PA3814 ''The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia'', Page 3814]&lt;/ref&gt; Modern history can be further broken down into the ''[[early modern period]]'' and the ''late modern period'' after the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Industrial Revolution]]. ''[[Contemporary history]]'' describes the span of historic events that are immediately relevant to the present time. The [[Great Divergence]]&lt;ref&gt;a term coined by [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]]&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the period of time in which the process by which the [[Western Europe]] and the parts of the [[New World]] overcame pre-modern growth constraints and emerged during the 19th century as the powerful and wealthy world [[civilization]] of the time, eclipsing [[Qing Dynasty|Qing China]], [[Mughal Empire|Mughal India]], [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa Japan]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]].

The modern era began approximately in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Dunan, Marcel. ''Larousse Encyclopedia of Modern History, From 1500 to the Present Day''. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; Many major events caused [[Europe]] to change around the start of the 16th century, starting with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, the fall of [[Muslim Spain]] and the discovery of the [[Americas]] in 1492, and [[Martin Luther]]'s [[Protestant Reformation]] in 1517. In [[England]] the modern period is often dated to the start of the [[Tudor period]] with the victory of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] over [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] at the [[Battle of Bosworth]] in 1485.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Miller, Aubrey Newman.

==== Early modern age ====
{{Main article|Early modern period}}
The modern era includes the early period, called the early modern period, which lasted from c. 1500 to around c. 1800 (most often 1815). Particular facets of early modernity include:
* The [[Renaissance]]
* [[Protestant reformation|The Reformation]] and [[Counter Reformation]].
* The [[Age of Discovery]]
* Rise of [[capitalism]]

The early period ended in a time of political and economic change as a result of [[mechanization]] in society, the [[American Revolution]], the first [[French Revolution]]; other factors included the redrawing of the map of Europe by the [[s:Final Act of the Congress of Vienna|Final Act]] of the [[Congress of Vienna]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bloy|first=Marjie|title=The Congress of Vienna, 1 November 1814 – 8 June 1815|publisher=The Victorian Web|date=30 April 2002|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/forpol/vienna.html|accessdate=2009-01-09}}

As a result of the [[Industrial Revolution]]s and the earlier political revolutions, the worldviews of [[Modernism]] emerged. The industrialization of many nations was initiated with the industrialization of Britain. Particular facets of the late modernity period include:
* Increasing role of [[science]] and [[technology]]
* Mass [[literacy]] and proliferation of [[mass media]]
* Spread of [[social movements]]
* Institution of [[representative democracy]]
* [[Individualism]]
* [[Industrialization]]
* [[Urbanization]]

Other important events in the development of the Late modern period include:
* The [[Revolutions of 1848]]
* The [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]]

The contemporary "[[Great Divergence (inequality)|Great Divergence]]" is a term given to a period starting in late 1970s when inequality grew substantially in the [[United States]] and to a lesser extent in other countries such as [[Canada]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. The term originated with [[List of Nobel laureates in Economics|Nobel laureate]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]] economist and ''[[New York Times]]'' columnist [[Paul Krugman]],&lt;ref&gt;Krugman, Paul, ''The Conscience of a Liberal'',  W W Norton &amp; Company, 2007, p.124-8&lt;/ref&gt; and is a reference to the "[[Great Compression]]", an earlier era in the 1930s and 40s when income became dramatically more equal in the United States and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://img.slate.com/media/3/100914_NoahT_GreatDivergence.pdf The Great Divergence.

'''World history''' or '''global history''' (not to be confused with [[diplomatic history|diplomatic]], [[transnational history|transnational]] or international history) is a field of [[historiography|historical study]] that emerged as a distinct academic field in the 1980s. It examines [[history]] from a global perspective. It is not to be confused with [[comparative history]], which, like world history, deals with the history of multiple cultures and nations, but does not do so on a global scale.  World history looks for common [[pattern]]s that emerge across all cultures. World historians use a [[theme (literature)|thematic]] approach, with two major focal points: [[syncretism|integration]] (how processes of world history have drawn people of the world together) and difference (how [[pattern]]s of world history reveal the diversity of the human experiences).&lt;ref&gt;J. Laurence Hare, and Jack Wells, "Promising the World: Surveys, Curricula, and the Challenge of Global History," ''History Teacher,'' 48 (Feb. 2015) pp: 371-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment and parameters of the field==

Jerry H. Bentley has observed that 'the term ''world history'' has never been a clear signifier with a stable referent', and that usage of the term overlaps with [[universal history]], [[comparative history]], [[global history]], [[big history]], [[macro history]], and [[transnational history]], amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry H. Bentley, 'The Task of World History', in ''[http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.001.0001 The Oxford Handbook of World History]'', ed. by Jerry H. Bentley (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 1-14, {{DOI|10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.013.0001}} (p. 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of world history as a distinct academic field of study can be traced to the 1960s, but the pace quickened in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry H. Bentley, 'The Task of World History', in ''[http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.001.0001 The Oxford Handbook of World History]'', ed. by Jerry H. Bentley (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 1-14, {{DOI|10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.013.0001}} (p. 2).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gran2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Gran|title=The Rise of the Rich: A New View of Modern World History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fOv-dewXZi4C|accessdate=25 May 2012|date=28 February 2009|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=978-0-8156-3171-2|page=XVI}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key step was the creation of the World History Association and graduate programs at a handful of universities. Over the next decades scholarly publications, professional and academic organizations, and graduate programs in World History proliferated. World History has often displaced Western Civilization in the required curriculum of American high schools and universities, and is supported by new textbooks with a world history approach.

World History attempts to recognise and address two structures that have profoundly shaped professional history-writing:
# A tendency to use current [[nation-states]] to the set the boundaries and agendas of studies of the past.
# A deep legacy of [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] assumptions (found especially, but not only, in Western history-writing).
Thus World History tends to study networks, connections, and systems that cross traditional boundaries of historical study like linguistic, cultural, and national borders. World History is often concerned to explore social dynamics that have led to large-scale changes in human society, such as [[industrialisation]] and the spread of [[capitalism]], and to analyse how large-scale changes like these have affected different parts of the world. Like other branches of history-writing in the second half of the twentieth century, World History has a scope far beyond historians' traditional focus on politics, wars, and diplomacy, taking in a panoply of subjects like [[gender history]], [[social history]], [[cultural history]], and [[environmental history]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerry H. Bentley, 'The Task of World History', in ''[http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.001.0001 The Oxford Handbook of World History]'', ed. by Jerry H. Bentley (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 1-14, {{DOI|10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.013.0001}} (p. 2).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizations===
* The H-World discussion list&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.h-net.org/~world/ H-World]&lt;/ref&gt; serves as a network of communication among practitioners of world history, with discussions among scholars, announcements, syllabi, bibliographies and book reviews.
* The [[International Society for the Comparative Study of Civilizations]] (ISCSC) approaches world history from the standpoint of comparative civilizations.  Founded at a conference in 1961 in [[Salzburg]], Austria, that was attended by Othmar Anderlie, [[Pitirim Sorokin]], and [[Arnold J.

==History==

===Pre-modern===
The study of world history, as distinct from national history, has existed in many world cultures. However, early forms of world history were not truly global, and were limited to only the regions known by the historian.

In [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]], Chinese world history, that of China and the surrounding people of [[East Asia]], was based on the [[dynastic cycle]] articulated by [[Sima Qian]] in circa 100 BC. Sima Qian's model is based on the [[Mandate of Heaven]]. Rulers rise when they united China, then are overthrown when a ruling dynasty became corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Sima Qian, ''Records of the Grand Historian: Qin Dynasty'' (3rd ed. 1995) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0231081693 excerpt and text search]; Burton Watson, ''Ssu-ma Ch'ien: Grand Historian of China'' (1958)&lt;/ref&gt; Each new dynasty begins virtuous and strong, but then decays, provoking the transfer of Heaven's mandate to a new ruler. The test of virtue in a new dynasty is success in being obeyed by China and neighboring barbarians. After 2000 years Sima Qian's model still dominates scholarship, although the [[dynastic cycle]] is no longer used for modern Chinese history.&lt;ref&gt;S. Y. Teng, "Chinese Historiography in the Last Fifty Years," ''The Far Eastern Quarterly,'' Vol. 8, No. 2 (Feb., 1949), pp. 131–156 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2049138 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ancient Greece]], [[Herodotus]] (5th century BC), as founder of Greek historiography,&lt;ref&gt;K.H. Waters, ''Herodotus the Historian'' (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; presents insightful and lively discussions of the customs, geography, and history of Mediterranean peoples, particularly the Egyptians. However, his great rival [[Thucydides]] promptly discarded Herodotus's all-embracing approach to history, offering instead a more precise, sharply focused monograph, dealing not with vast empires over the centuries but with 27 years of war between Athens and Sparta. In Rome, the vast, patriotic history of Rome by Livy (59 BC-17 AD) approximated Herodotean inclusiveness;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick G. Walsh, ''Livy: His Historical Aims and Methods'' (1961)&lt;/ref&gt; Polybius (c.200-c.118 BC) aspired to combine the logical rigor of Thucydides with the scope of Herodotus.&lt;ref&gt;Frank W. Walbank, ''A Historical Commentary on Polybius,'' (3 vols. 1957–82)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Central Asia, [[The Secret History of Mongols]] is regarded as the single significant native Mongolian account of Genghis Khan. The Secret History is regarded as a piece of classic literature in both Mongolia and the rest of the world.

In the Middle East, [[Ala'iddin Ata-Malik Juvayni]] (1226–1283) was a Persian historian who wrote an account of the Mongol Empire entitled Ta' rīkh-i jahān-gushā (History of the World Conqueror).&lt;ref&gt;History of the World Conqueror by Ala Ad Din Ata Malik Juvaini, translated by John Andrew Boyle, Harvard University Press 1958, Project Gutenberg on line edition&lt;/ref&gt; The standard edition of Juvayni is published under the title Ta' rīkh-i jahān-gushā, ed. Mirza Muhammad Qazwini, 3 vol, Gibb Memorial Series 16 (Leiden and London, 1912–37). An English translation by John Andrew Boyle "The History of the World-Conqueror" was republished in 1997.

[[Rashīd al-Dīn Fadhl-allāh Hamadānī]] (1247–1318), was a Persian physician of Jewish origin, polymathic writer and historian, who wrote an enormous Islamic history, the Jami al-Tawarikh, in the Persian language, often considered a landmark in intercultural historiography and a key document on the Ilkhanids (13th and 14th century).&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, H. M. (Henry Miers), Sir; John Dowson. "10. Jámi'u-t Tawáríkh, of Rashid-al-Din". [[The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians]]. The Muhammadan Period (Vol 3.). London : Trübner &amp; Co.. https://archive.org/stream/cu31924073036737#page/n15/mode/2up.&lt;/ref&gt; His encyclopedic knowledge of a wide range of cultures from Mongolia to China to the Steppes of Central Eurasia to Persia, the Arabic-speaking lands, and Europe, provide the most direct access to information on the late Mongol era. His descriptions also highlight the manner in which the Mongol Empire and its emphasis on trade resulted in an atmosphere of cultural and religious exchange and intellectual ferment, resulting in the transmission of a host of ideas from East to West and vice versa.

One Muslim scholar, [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332-1409) broke with traditionalism and offered a model of historical change in ''Muqaddimah,'' an exposition of the methodology of scientific history. Ibn Khaldun focused on the reasons for the rise and fall of civilization, arguing that the causes of change are to be sought in the economic and social structure of society. His work was largely ignored in the Muslim world.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Khaldun, ''The Muqaddimah: An Introduction to History'' ed. by N. J. Dawood, Bruce Lawrence, and Franz Rosenthal (2004) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0691120544 excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise the Muslim, Chinese and Indian intellectuals held fast to a religious traditionalism, leaving them unprepared to advise national leaders on how to confront the European intrusion into Asia after 1500 AD.

===Early modern===
During the [[Renaissance]] in Europe, history was written about states or nations. The study of history changed during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Romanticism]]. [[Voltaire]] described the history of certain ages that he considered important, rather than describing events in chronological order. History became an independent discipline. It was not called ''philosophia historiae'' anymore, but merely history (''historia'').Voltaire, in the 18th century, attempted to revolutionize the study of world history. First, Voltaire concluded that the traditional study of history was flawed. The Christian Church, one of the most powerful entities in his time, had presented a framework for studying history. Voltaire, when writing ''History of Charles XII'' (1731) and ''The Age of Louis XIV'' (1751), instead choose to focus economics, politics and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/voltaire-9520178|title=Voltaire|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These aspects of history were mostly unexplored by his contemporaries and would each develop into their own sections of world history. Above all else, Voltaire regarded truth as the most essential part of recording world history. Nationalism and religion only subtracted from objective truth, so Voltaire freed himself for their influence when he recorded history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Shank|first=J.B.|title=Voltaire|date=2015|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2015/entries/voltaire/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2015|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giambattista Vico]] (1668–1744) in Italy wrote ''Scienza nuva seconda'' (The New Science) in 1725, which argued history as the expression of human will and deeds.  He thought that men are historical entities and that human nature changes over time. Each epoch should be seen as a whole in which all aspects of culture—art, religion, philosophy, politics, and economics—are interrelated (a point developed later by [[Oswald Spengler]]). Vico showed that myth, poetry, and art are entry points to discovering the true spirit of a culture. Vico outlined a conception of historical development in which great cultures, like Rome, undergo cycles of growth and decline.  His ideas were out of fashion during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], but influenced the Romantic historians after 1800.

A major theoretical foundation for world history was given by German philosopher [[G. W. F. Hegel]], who saw the modern Prussian state as the latest (though often confused with the highest) stage of world development.

G.W.F. Hegel developed three lenses through which he believed world history could be viewed. Documents produced during a historical period, such as journal entries and contractual agreements, were considered by Hegel to be part of Original History. These documents are produced by a person enveloped within a culture, making them conduits of vital information but also limited in their contextual knowledge. Documents which pertain to Hegel’s Original History are classified by modern historians as primary sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Little|first=Daniel|title=Philosophy of History|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/history/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflective History, Hegel’s second lens, are documents written with some temporal distance separating the event which is discussed in the academic writing. What limited this lens, according to Hegel, was the imposition of the writers own cultural values and views on the historical event. This criticism of Reflective History was later formalized by Anthropologists Franz Boa and coined as Cultural relativism by Alain Locke. Both of these lenses were considered to be partially flawed by Hegel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Soul and the Body in Hegel's Anthropology|last=Nicholas|first=Mowad|publisher=Loyola University Chicago|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel termed the lens which he advocated to view world history through as Philosophical History.  In order to view history through this lens, one must analyze events, civilizations, and periods objectively. When done in this fashion, the historian can then extract the prevailing theme from their studies. This lens differs from the rest because it is void of any cultural biases and takes a more analytical approach to history. World History can be a broad topic, so focusing on extracting the most valuable information from certain periods may be the most beneficial approach. This third lens, as did Hegel’s definitions of the other two, affected the study of history in the early modern period and our contemporary period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCabe|first=David|title=Hegel and the Idea of Philosophical History|jstor=27744789|journal=History of Philosophy Quarterly|volume=15|issue=3|pages=369–388|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early modern historian was Adam Ferguson. Ferguson’s main contribution to the study of world history was his ''An Essay on the History of Civil Society'' (1767).&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Adam. ''An Essay on the History of Civil Society. (1767).''&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ferguson, world history was a combination of two forms of history. One was natural history; the aspects of our world which god created. The other, which was more revolutionary, was social history. For him, social history was the progress humans made towards fulfilling God’s plan for humanity. He believed that progress, which could be achieved through individuals pursuing commercial success, would bring us closer to a perfect society; but we would never reach one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=TEE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF ADAM FERGUSON A COMMENTARY CN HIS ESSAY CK THE HISTORY OF CIVIL SOCIETY|last=Hamowy|first=Ronald|publisher=The University of Chicago|year=1969|isbn=|location=Chicago, Illinois|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he also theorized that a complete dedication to commercial success could lead to societal collapse—like what happened in Rome—because people would lose morality. Through this lens, Ferguson viewed world history as humanities struggle to reach an ideal society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/cla/faculty/jhamlin/4111/Ferguson/Adam%20Ferguson.htm|title=Adam Ferguson|website=www.d.umn.edu|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry Home, Lord Kames was a philosopher during the Enlightenment and contributed to the study or world history. In his major historical work, ''Sketches on the History of Man'', Home’s outlined the four stages of human history which he observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/kames.htm|title=Henry Home, Lord Kames|website=www.hetwebsite.net|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first and most primitive stage was small hunter-gatherer groups. Then, in order to form larger groups, humans transitioned into the second stage when they began to domesticate animals. The third stage was the development of agriculture. This new technology established trade and higher levels of cooperation amongst sizable groups of people. With the gathering of people into agricultural villages, laws and social obligations needed to be developed so a form of order could be maintained. The fourth, and final stage, involved humans moving into market towns and seaports where agriculture was not the focus. Instead, commerce and other forms of labor arouse in a society. By defining the stages of human history, Homes influenced his successors. He also contributed to the development of other studies such as sociology and anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/pages/kames-on-progress-and-providence|title=Kames on Progress and Providence  - Online Library of Liberty|website=oll.libertyfund.org|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary===
World history became a popular genre in the 20th century with [[universal history]]. In the 1920s, several best-sellers dealt with the history of the world, including surveys ''[[The Story of Mankind]]'' (1921) by [[Hendrik Willem van Loon]] and ''[[The Outline of History]]'' (1918) by [[H.G. Wells]]. Influential writers who have reached wide audiences include [[H. G. Wells]], [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], [[Pitirim Sorokin]], [[Carroll Quigley]], [[Christopher Dawson]],&lt;ref&gt;Bradley J. Birzer, ''Sanctifying the World: The Augustinian Life and Mind of Christopher Dawson'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lewis Mumford]]. Scholars working the field include [[Eric Voegelin]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael P. Federici, ''Eric Voegelin: The Restoration of Order'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Hardy McNeill]] and [[Michael Mann (sociologist)|Michael Mann]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Mann, ''The Sources of Social Power: Volume 1, A History of Power from the Beginning to AD 1760'' (1986) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/052131349X excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; With evolving technologies such as dating methods and surveying laser technology called LiDAR, contemporary historians have access to knew information which changes how past civilizations are studied.

[[Oswald Spengler|Spengler's]] ''Decline of the West'' (2 vol 1919–1922) compared nine organic cultures: Egyptian (3400 BC-1200 BC), Indian (1500 BC-1100 BC), Chinese (1300 BC-AD 200), Classical (1100 BC-400 BC), Byzantine (AD 300–1100), Aztec (AD 1300–1500), Arabian (AD 300–1250), Mayan (AD 600–960), and Western (AD 900–1900). His book was a smashing success among intellectuals worldwide as it predicted the disintegration of European and American civilization after a violent "age of Caesarism," arguing by detailed analogies with other civilizations. It deepened the post-World War I pessimism in Europe, and was warmly received by intellectuals in China, India, and Latin America who hoped his predictions of the collapse of European empires would soon come true.&lt;ref&gt;Neil McInnes, "The Great Doomsayer: Oswald Spengler Reconsidered." ''National Interest'' 1997 (48): 65–76. Fulltext: [[Ebsco]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936–1954, [[Arnold J. Toynbee|Toynbee's]] ten-volume ''A Study of History'' came out in three separate installments. He followed Spengler in taking a comparative topical approach to independent civilizations. Toynbee said they displayed striking parallels in their origin, growth, and decay. Toynbee rejected Spengler's biological model of civilizations as organisms with a typical life span of 1,000 years. Like [[Sima Qian]], Toynbee explained decline as due to their moral failure. Many readers rejoiced in his implication (in vols. 1–6) that only a return to some form of Catholicism could halt the breakdown of western civilization which began with the Reformation. Volumes 7–10, published in 1954, abandoned the religious message, and his popular audience slipped away, while scholars  picked apart his mistakes.,&lt;ref&gt;William H. McNeill, ''Arnold J. Toynbee a Life'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Hardy McNeill|McNeill]] wrote ''[[The Rise of the West]]'' (1963) to improve upon Toynbee by showing how the separate civilizations of Eurasia interacted from the very beginning of their history, borrowing critical skills from one another, and thus precipitating still further change as adjustment between traditional old and borrowed new knowledge and practice became necessary. McNeill took a broad approach organized around the interactions of peoples across the Earth. Such interactions have become both more numerous and more continual and substantial in recent times. Before about 1500, the network of communication between cultures was that of Eurasia. The term for these areas of interaction differ from one world historian to another and include ''world-system'' and ''ecumene.''  Whatever it is called, the importance of these intercultural contacts has begun to be recognized by many scholars.&lt;ref&gt;William H. McNeill, "The Changing Shape of World History." ''History and Theory'' 1995 34(2): 8–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History education==

===United States===
[[T. Walter Wallbank]] and [[Alastair M. Taylor]] co-authored ''Civilization Past &amp; Present'', the first world-history textbook published in the United States (1942). With additional authors, this very successful work went through numerous editions up to the first decade of the twenty-first century. According to the Golden Anniversary edition of 1992, the ongoing objective of ''Civilization Past &amp; Present'' "was to present a survey of world cultural history, treating the development and growth of civilization not as a unique European experience but as a global one through which all the great culture systems have interacted to produce the present-day world. It attempted to include all the elements of history – social, economic, political, religious, aesthetic, legal, and technological."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Civilization Past &amp; Present|last=Wallbank|first=T. Walter, et al.|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1992|isbn=978-0-673-38867-4|location=New York|pages=xxv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In college curricula of the United States, world history became a popular replacement for courses on [[Western Civilization]]. Professors [[Patrick Manning (professor)|Patrick Manning]], previously of Northeastern University and now at the University of Pittsburgh's World History Center; and [[Ross E. Dunn]] at San Diego State are leaders in promoting innovative teaching methods.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Manning, ''Navigating World History: Historians Create a Global Past'' (2003); [[Ross E. Dunn]], ed., ''The New World History: A Teacher's Companion.'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

In schools of architecture in the U.S., the [[National Architectural Accrediting Board]] now requires that schools teach history that includes a non-west or global perspective. This reflects a decade-long effort to move past the standard Euro-centric approach that had dominated the field.&lt;ref&gt;See Points 8 and 9. http://www.naab.org/adaview.aspx?pageid=120&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent themes==
In recent years, the relationship between African and world history has shifted rapidly from one of antipathy to one of engagement and synthesis. Reynolds (2007) surveys the relationship between African and world histories, with an emphasis on the tension between the area studies paradigm and the growing world-history emphasis on connections and exchange across regional boundaries. A closer examination of recent exchanges and debates over the merits of this exchange is also featured. Reynolds sees the relationship between African and world history as a measure of the changing nature of historical inquiry over the past century.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan T. Reynolds, "Africa and World History: from Antipathy to Synergy." ''History Compass'' 2007 5(6): 1998–2013. ISSN 1478-0542 Fulltext: [1. History Compass]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marxian theory of history==
{{Main|Marx's theory of history#The stages of history }}

The [[Marxist theory]] of [[historical materialism]] claims the history of the world is fundamentally determined by the ''material conditions'' at any given time&amp;nbsp;– in other words, the relationships which people have with each other in order to fulfil basic needs such as feeding, clothing and housing themselves and their families.&lt;ref&gt;See, in particular, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ Marx and Engels, ''The German Ideology'']&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] claimed to have identified five successive stages of the development of these material conditions in [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Marx makes no claim to have produced a master key to history. Historical materialism is not "an historico-philosophic theory of the marche generale imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself" (Marx, Karl: Letter to editor of the Russian paper ''Otetchestvennye Zapiskym'', 1877). His ideas, he explains, are based on a concrete study of the actual conditions that pertained in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory divides the history of the world into the following periods:&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''Early writings'', Penguin, 1975, p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Charles Taylor 1980 p. 330"&gt;Charles Taylor, “Critical Notice”, ''Canadian Journal of Philosophy'' 10 (1980), p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030705120509/http://www.marx.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/index.htm Marx and Engels, ''The Critique of the Gotha Programme'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=civilwar&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030705030211/http://www.marx.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/index.htm Marx and Engels, ''The Civil War in France'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
