The '''Enlightenment''' (also known as the '''Age of Enlightenment''' or the '''Age of Reason''')&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Enlightened Piety during the Age of Benevolence: The Christian Knowledge Movement in the British Atlantic World|last=Roberson|first=Rusty|year=2016|journal=Church History|volume=85|issue=2|page=246|doi=10.1017/S0009640716000391}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-fr|le Siècle des Lumières|lit=the Century of Lights}}; {{lang-ger|Aufklärung}}, "Enlightenment"; {{lang-it|L’Illuminismo}}, “Enlightenment”; [[Polish language|Polish]]: ''Oświecenie'', "Enlightenment"; [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''La Ilustración'', "Enlightenment"){{citation|chapter=Enlightenment|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|series=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.|year=2016|url=http://www.britannica.com/event/Enlightenment-European-history|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an intellectual and philosophical movement that dominated the world of ideas in Europe during the 18th century, the "Century of Philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publishinghau5.com/The-Age-of-Enlightenment--A-History-From-Beginning-to-End-page-3.php|title=The Age of Enlightenment: A History From Beginning to End: Chapter 3|work=publishinghau5.com|accessdate=3 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303123359/http://publishinghau5.com/The-Age-of-Enlightenment--A-History-From-Beginning-to-End-page-3.php|archivedate=3 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French historians traditionally place the Enlightenment between 1715 (the year that [[Louis XIV]] died) and 1789 (the beginning of the [[French Revolution]]). International historians begin the period in the 1620s, with the start of the [[scientific revolution]]. ''{{lang|fr|[[Philosophes|Les philosophes]]}}'' ({{Langnf||French|"the philosophers"|links=no}}) of the period widely circulated their ideas through meetings at [[Academy|scientific academies]], [[Masonic lodge]]s, [[literary salon]]s, [[Coffeehouse|coffee house]]s and in [[book|printed books]] and [[pamphlet]]s. The ideas of the Enlightenment undermined the authority of the monarchy and the Church and paved the way for the political revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries. A variety of 19th-century movements, including [[liberalism]] and [[neo-classicism]], trace their intellectual heritage to the Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Eugen Weber, ''Movements, Currents, Trends: Aspects of European Thought in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Enlightenment included a range of ideas centered on [[reason]] as the primary source of authority and legitimacy and came to advance ideals like [[liberty]], [[Idea of progress|progress]], [[toleration|tolerance]], [[Fraternity (philosophy)|fraternity]], [[constitutional government]] and [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Outram|first=Dorinda|title=Panorama of the Enlightenment|publisher=Getty Publications|year=2006|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A84nA7Ae3t0C&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=%22Panorama%20of%20the%20Enlightenment%22&amp;pg=PA29|isbn=9780892368617}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Milan|last=Zafirovski|title=The Enlightenment and Its Effects on Modern Society|year=2010|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, the central doctrines of the Enlightenment philosophers were [[individual liberty]] and [[religious tolerance]], in opposition to an [[absolute monarchy]] and the fixed dogmas of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. The Enlightenment was marked by an emphasis on the [[scientific method]] and [[reductionism]], along with increased questioning of religious orthodoxy—an attitude captured by the phrase ''[[Sapere aude]]'', "Dare to know".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Gay, Peter|title=The Enlightenment: An Interpretation|publisher=W.

The Age of Enlightenment was preceded by and closely associated with the [[scientific revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;I. Bernard Cohen, "Scientific Revolution and Creativity in the Enlightenment." ''Eighteenth-Century Life'' 7.2 (1982): 41–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier philosophers whose work influenced the Enlightenment included [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[John Locke|Locke]], and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]].&lt;ref&gt;Sootin, Harry. "Isaac Newton." New York, Messner (1955)&lt;/ref&gt; The major figures of the Enlightenment included [[Cesare Beccaria|Beccaria]], [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]], [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Montesquieu]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Adam Smith]], and [[Voltaire]]. Some European rulers, including [[Catherine II of Russia]], [[Joseph II of Austria]] and [[Frederick II of Prussia]], tried to apply Enlightenment thought on religious and political tolerance, which became known as [[enlightened absolutism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Black, "Ancien Regime and Enlightenment. Some Recent Writing on Seventeenth-and Eighteenth-Century Europe," ''European History Quarterly'' 22.2 (1992): 247–55.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Franklin]] visited Europe repeatedly and contributed actively to the scientific and political debates there and brought the newest ideas back to Philadelphia. [[Thomas Jefferson]] closely followed European ideas and later incorporated some of the ideals of the Enlightenment into the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence (1776)]]. One of his peers, [[James Madison]], incorporated these ideals into the [[United States Constitution]] during its framing in 1787.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Ferguson, ''The American Enlightenment, 1750–1820'' (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

The most influential publication of the Enlightenment was the ''{{lang|fr|[[Encyclopédie]]}}'' (''Encyclopaedia''). Published between 1751 and 1772 in thirty-five volumes, it was compiled by Diderot, [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] (until 1759) and a team of 150 scientists and philosophers. It helped spread the ideas of the Enlightenment across Europe and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Darnton, ''The Business of Enlightenment: a publishing history of the Encyclopédie, 1775–1800'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Other landmark publications were Voltaire's ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique]]'' (''Philosophical Dictionary''; 1764) and ''[[Letters on the English]]'' (1733); Rousseau's ''[[Discourse on Inequality]]'' (1754) and ''[[The Social Contract]]'' (1762); Adam Smith's ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]'' (1759) and ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776); and Montesquieu's ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'' (1748). The ideas of the Enlightenment played a major role in inspiring the [[French Revolution]], which began in 1789. After the Revolution, the Enlightenment was followed by the intellectual movement known as [[Romanticism]].

==Philosophy==
[[René Descartes]]' [[rationalist]] philosophy laid the foundation for enlightenment thinking. His attempt to construct the sciences on a secure metaphysical foundation was not as successful as his [[Cartesian doubt|method of doubt]] applied in philosophic areas leading to a [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualistic doctrine]] of mind and matter. His [[skepticism]] was refined by [[John Locke]]'s [[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]] (1690) and [[David Hume]]'s writings in the 1740s. His dualism was challenged by [[Spinoza]]'s uncompromising assertion of the unity of matter in his [[Tractatus Theologico-Politicus|Tractatus]] (1670) and [[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]] (1677).

These laid down two distinct lines of Enlightenment thought: first, the moderate variety, following Descartes, Locke and [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]], which sought accommodation between reform and the traditional systems of power and faith, and second, the radical enlightenment, inspired by the philosophy of [[Spinoza]], advocating democracy, individual liberty, freedom of expression and eradication of religious authority.{{sfn|Israel|2006|p=15}}{{sfn|Israel|2010|pp=vii–viii, 19}} The moderate variety tended to be [[deistic]], whereas the radical tendency separated the basis of morality entirely from theology. Both lines of thought were eventually opposed by a conservative [[Counter-Enlightenment]], which sought a return to faith.{{sfn|Israel|2010|p=11}}

[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]]]

In the mid-18th century, Paris became the center of an explosion of philosophic and scientific activity challenging traditional doctrines and dogmas. The philosophic movement was led by [[Voltaire]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who argued for a society based upon reason rather than faith and Catholic doctrine, for a new civil order based on natural law, and for science based on experiments and observation. The political philosopher [[Montesquieu]] introduced the idea of a [[separation of powers]] in a government, a concept which was enthusiastically adopted by the authors of the United States Constitution. While the ''Philosophes'' of the French Enlightenment were not revolutionaries and many were members of the nobility, their ideas played an important part in undermining the legitimacy of the Old Regime and shaping the [[French Revolution]].{{sfn|Petitfils|2005|pages=99–105}}

[[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], a moral philosopher, described the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] and [[consequentialism|consequentialist]] principle that virtue is that which provides, in his words, "the greatest happiness for the greatest numbers". Much of what is incorporated in the [[scientific method]] (the nature of knowledge, evidence, experience and causation) and some modern attitudes towards the relationship between science and religion were developed by his protégés [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Smith]].&lt;ref name="Denby"&gt;{{Citation|title=The Scottish enlightenment and the challenges for Europe in the 21st century; climate change and energy|journal=The New Yorker|date=11 October 2004|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/10/11/041011crat_atlarge|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5z3E5hVjt?url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/10/11/041011crat_atlarge|archivedate=29 May 2011|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hume became a major figure in the [[Philosophical skepticism|skeptical philosophical]] and [[empiricist]] traditions of philosophy.

[[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) tried to reconcile [[rationalism]] and religious belief, individual freedom and political authority, as well as map out a view of the public sphere through private and public reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mnstate.edu/gracyk/courses/web%20publishing/KantOnElightenment.htm|title=Kant's essay What is Enlightenment?|work=mnstate.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kant's work continued to shape German thought and indeed all of European philosophy, well into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Kuehn, ''Kant: A Biography'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] was one of England's earliest [[feminist]] philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steven Kreis |url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/wollstonecraft.html |title=Mary Wollstonecraft, 1759–1797 |publisher=Historyguide.org |date=2012-04-13 |accessdate=2014-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111055540/http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/wollstonecraft.html |archivedate=2014-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She argued for a society based on reason and that women as well as men should be treated as rational beings. She is best known for her work ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1791).&lt;ref&gt;Mary Wollstonecraft, ''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman'' (Renascence Editions, 2000) [https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1794/785/vindication.pdf?sequence=1 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science==
{{main|Science in the Age of Enlightenment}}
Science played an important role in Enlightenment discourse and thought. Many Enlightenment writers and thinkers had backgrounds in the sciences and associated scientific advancement with the overthrow of religion and traditional authority in favour of the development of free speech and thought. Scientific progress during the Enlightenment included the discovery of [[carbon dioxide]] (fixed air) by the chemist [[Joseph Black]], the argument for [[deep time]] by the geologist [[James Hutton]] and the invention of the steam engine by [[James Watt]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce P. Lenman, ''Integration and Enlightenment: Scotland, 1746–1832'' (1993)  [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0748603859 excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; The experiments of Lavoisier were used to create the first modern chemical plants in Paris and the experiments of the [[Montgolfier Brothers]] enabled them to launch the first manned flight in a hot-air balloon on 21 November 1783 from the [[Château de la Muette]], near the [[Bois de Boulogne]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarmant, Thierry, ''Histoire de Paris'', p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadly speaking, Enlightenment science greatly valued [[empiricism]] and rational thought and was embedded with the Enlightenment ideal of advancement and progress. The study of science, under the heading of [[natural philosophy]], was divided into physics and a conglomerate grouping of chemistry and [[natural history]], which included [[anatomy]], biology, [[geology]], [[mineralogy]] and [[zoology]].&lt;ref&gt;Porter (2003), 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; As with most Enlightenment views, the benefits of science were not seen universally: Rousseau criticized the sciences for distancing man from nature and not operating to make people happier.&lt;ref&gt;Burns (2003), entry: 7,103.&lt;/ref&gt; Science during the Enlightenment was dominated by scientific societies and [[Academy|academies]], which had largely replaced universities as centres of scientific research and development. Societies and academies were also the backbone of the maturation of the scientific profession. Another important development was the [[popular culture|popularization]] of science among an increasingly literate population. [[Philosophe]]s introduced the public to many scientific theories, most notably through the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' and the popularization of [[Newtonianism]] by [[Voltaire]] and Émilie du Châtelet. Some historians have marked the 18th century as a drab period in the [[history of science]].&lt;ref&gt;see Hall (1954), iii; Mason (1956), 223.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the century saw significant advancements in the practice of [[medicine]], [[mathematics]] and [[physics]]; the development of biological [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]; a new understanding of [[magnetism]] and [[electricity]]; and the maturation of [[chemistry]] as a discipline, which established the foundations of modern chemistry.

Scientific academies and societies grew out of the Scientific Revolution as the creators of scientific knowledge in contrast to the scholasticism of the university.&lt;ref&gt;Gillispie, (1980), p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Enlightenment, some societies created or retained links to universities, but contemporary sources distinguished universities from scientific societies by claiming that the university's utility was in the transmission of knowledge while societies functioned to create knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;James E. McClellan III, "Learned Societies," in ''Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment'', ed. Alan Charles Kors (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003) {{cite web |url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/HistoryWorld/Modern/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195104301 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330082517/http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/HistoryWorld/Modern/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195104301 |archivedate=2012-03-30 |df= }} (accessed on June 8, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; As the role of universities in institutionalized science began to diminish, learned societies became the cornerstone of organized science. Official scientific societies were chartered by the state in order to provide technical expertise.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, (2003), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Most societies were granted permission to oversee their own publications, control the election of new members and the administration of the society.&lt;ref&gt;See Gillispie, (1980), "Conclusion."&lt;/ref&gt; After 1700, a tremendous number of official academies and societies were founded in Europe and by 1789 there were over seventy official scientific societies. In reference to this growth, [[Bernard de Fontenelle]] coined the term "the Age of Academies" to describe the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, (2003), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of science also began appearing more commonly in poetry and literature during the Enlightenment. Some poetry became infused with [[scientific metaphor]] and imagery, while other poems were written directly about scientific topics. [[Sir Richard Blackmore]] committed the Newtonian system to verse in ''Creation, a Philosophical Poem in Seven Books'' (1712). After Newton's death in 1727, poems were composed in his honour for decades.&lt;ref name="Burns, 2003, entry: 158"&gt;Burns, (2003), entry: 158.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Thomson (poet)|James Thomson]] (1700–1748) penned his "Poem to the Memory of Newton", which mourned the loss of Newton, but also praised his science and legacy.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, (1786), p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology, economics and law==
[[File:Cesare Beccaria in Dei delitti crop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cesare Beccaria]], father of classical criminal theory (1738–1794)]]

Hume and other Scottish Enlightenment thinkers developed a "[[science of man]]",&lt;ref name="Magnusson"&gt;{{Citation|last=M. Magnusson|title=Review of James Buchan, ''Capital of the Mind: how Edinburgh Changed the World''|journal=New Statesman|date=10 November 2003|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200311100040|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5z3JQonlV?url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200311100040|deadurl=yes|archivedate=29 May 2011|accessdate=27 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was expressed historically in works by authors including [[James Burnett]], [[Adam Ferguson]], [[John Millar (philosopher)|John Millar]] and [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]], all of whom merged a scientific study of how humans behaved in ancient and primitive cultures with a strong awareness of the determining forces of [[modernity]]. Modern sociology largely originated from this movement&lt;ref&gt;A. Swingewood, "Origins of Sociology: The Case of the Scottish Enlightenment", ''The British Journal of Sociology'', vol. 21, no. 2 (June 1970), pp. 164–80 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/588406 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt; and Hume's philosophical concepts that directly influenced James Madison (and thus the U.S. Constitution) and as popularised by [[Dugald Stewart]], would be the basis of [[classical liberalism]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Daiches, P. Jones and J. Jones, ''A Hotbed of Genius: The Scottish Enlightenment, 1730–1790'' (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1776, Adam Smith published ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', often considered the first work on modern economics as it had an immediate impact on British economic policy that continues into the 21st century.&lt;ref name="Fry"&gt;M. Fry, ''Adam Smith's Legacy: His Place in the Development of Modern Economics'' (Routledge, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; It was immediately preceded and influenced by [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune]] drafts of ''[[Reflections on the Formation and Distribution of Wealth]]'' (Paris, 1766). Smith acknowledged indebtedness and possibly was the original English translator.&lt;ref&gt;The Illusion of Free Markets, Bernard E. Harcourt, p. 260, notes 11–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cesare Beccaria]], a jurist, criminologist, philosopher and politician and one of the great Enlightenment writers, became famous for his masterpiece ''Of Crimes and Punishments'' (1764), later translated into 22 languages,&lt;ref name="history-world.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-world.org/enlightenment_throughout_europe.htm |title=The Enlightenment throughout Europe |publisher=History-world.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; which condemned torture and the death penalty and was a founding work in the field of penology and the Classical School of criminology by promoting criminal justice. Another prominent intellectual was [[Francesco Mario Pagano]], who wrote important studies such as ''Saggi Politici'' (Political Essays, 1783), one of the major works of the Enlightenment in Naples; and ''Considerazioni sul processo criminale'' (Considerations on the criminal trial, 1787), which established him as an international authority on criminal law.&lt;ref&gt;Roland Sarti, ''Italy: A Reference Guide from the Renaissance to the Present'', Infobase Publishing, 2009, p. 457&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
The Enlightenment has long been hailed as the foundation of modern Western political and intellectual culture.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Brewer, ''The Enlightenment Past: reconstructing eighteenth-century French thought'' (2008), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The Enlightenment brought political modernization to the West, in terms of introducing democratic values and institutions and the creation of modern, liberal democracies. This thesis has been widely accepted by Anglophone scholars and has been reinforced by the large-scale studies by [[Robert Darnton]], [[Roy Porter]] and most recently by Jonathan Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Dijn | first1 = Annelien | year = 2012 | title = The Politics of Enlightenment: From Peter Gay to Jonathan Israel | url = | journal = Historical Journal | volume = 55 | issue = 3| pages = 785–805 | doi=10.1017/s0018246x12000301}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=von Guttner|first=Darius|title=The French Revolution|url=https://www.academia.edu/9869783/The_French_Revolution|year=2015|publisher=Nelson Cengage|pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theories of government===
John Locke, one of the most influential Enlightenment thinkers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke/influence.html |title=John Locke &gt; The Influence of John Locke's Works (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; based his governance philosophy in [[social contract theory]], a subject that permeated Enlightenment political thought. The English philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] ushered in this new debate with his work ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' in 1651. Hobbes also developed some of the fundamentals of European [[classical liberalism|liberal thought]]: the right of the individual; the natural equality of all men; the artificial character of the political order (which led to the later distinction between [[civil society]] and the state); the view that all legitimate political power must be "representative" and based on the consent of the people; and a liberal interpretation of law which leaves people free to do whatever the law does not explicitly forbid.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Manent, ''An Intellectual History of Liberalism'' (1994) pp. 20–38&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rousseau.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Like other Enlightenment philosophers, [[Rousseau]] was critical of the [[Atlantic slave trade]]&lt;ref&gt;"[http://abolition.nypl.org/print/abolition/ The Abolition of The Slave Trade]"&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Both Locke and Rousseau developed social contract theories in ''Two Treatises of Government'' and ''[[Discourse on Inequality]]'', respectively. While quite different works, Locke, Hobbes and Rousseau agreed that a social contract, in which the government's authority lies in the consent of the governed,&lt;ref&gt;Lessnoff, Michael H. Social Contract Theory. New York: New York U, 1990. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; is necessary for man to live in civil society. Locke defines the state of nature as a condition in which humans are rational and follow natural law, in which all men are born equal and with the right to life, liberty and property. However, when one citizen breaks the Law of Nature both the transgressor and the victim enter into a state of war, from which it is virtually impossible to break free. Therefore, Locke said that individuals enter into civil society to protect their natural rights via an "unbiased judge" or common authority, such as courts, to appeal to. Contrastingly, Rousseau's conception relies on the supposition that "civil man" is corrupted, while "natural man" has no want he cannot fulfill himself. Natural man is only taken out of the state of nature when the inequality associated with private property is established.&lt;ref&gt;Discourse on the Origin of Inequality&lt;/ref&gt; Rousseau said that people join into civil society via the social contract to achieve unity while preserving individual freedom. This is embodied in the sovereignty of the [[general will]], the moral and collective legislative body constituted by citizens.

Locke is known for his statement that individuals have a right to "Life, Liberty and Property" and his belief that the natural right to property is derived from labor. Tutored by Locke, [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury]] wrote in 1706: "There is a mighty Light which spreads its self over the world especially in those two free Nations of England and Holland; on whom the Affairs of Europe now turn".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first =B.|last=Rand|title=The Life, Unpublished Letters and Philosophical Regimen of Anthony, Earl of Shaftesbury|year=1900|page=353}} quoted in {{citation|first=Roy|last=Porter|title=Enlightenment, Britain and the Creation of the Modern World|publisher=Allen Lane, The Penguin Press|year=2000|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Locke's theory of natural rights has influenced many political documents, including the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] and the French National Constituent Assembly's [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]].

The ''philosophes'' argued that the establishment of a contractual basis of rights would lead to the [[market mechanism]] and [[capitalism]], the [[scientific method]], religious [[Toleration|tolerance]] and the organization of states into self-governing republics through democratic means. In this view, the tendency of the ''[[philosophes]]&lt;!-- "philosophes" is correct --&gt;'' in particular to apply [[rationality]] to every problem is considered the essential change.&lt;ref&gt;Lorraine Y. Landry, ''Marx and the postmodernism debates: an agenda for critical theory'' (2000) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Although much of Enlightenment political thought was dominated by social contract theorists, both David Hume and Adam Ferguson criticized this camp. Hume's essay ''Of the Original Contract'' argues that governments derived from consent are rarely seen and civil government is grounded in a ruler's habitual authority and force. It is precisely because of the ruler's authority over-and-against the subject, that the subject tacitly consents and Hume says that the subjects would "never imagine that their consent made him sovereign", rather the authority did so.&lt;ref&gt;Of the Original Contract&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Ferguson did not believe citizens built the state, rather polities grew out of social development. In his 1767 ''[[An Essay on the History of Civil Society]]'', Ferguson uses the four stages of progress, a theory that was very popular in Scotland at the time, to explain how humans advance from a hunting and gathering society to a commercial and civil society without "signing" a social contract.

Both Rousseau and Locke's social contract theories rest on the presupposition of [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]], which are not a result of law or custom, but are things that all men have in pre-political societies and are therefore universal and inalienable. The most famous natural right formulation comes from John Locke in his ''Second Treatise'', when he introduces the state of nature. For Locke, the law of nature is grounded on mutual security or the idea that one cannot infringe on another's natural rights, as every man is equal and has the same inalienable rights. These natural rights include perfect equality and freedom, as well as the right to preserve life and property. Locke also argued against slavery on the basis that enslaving yourself goes against the law of nature because you cannot surrender your own rights, your freedom is absolute and no one can take it from you. Additionally, Locke argues that one person cannot enslave another because it is morally reprehensible, although he introduces a caveat by saying that enslavement of a lawful captive in time of war would not go against one's natural rights.

As a spillover of the Enlightenment, nonsecular beliefs expressed first by Quakers and then by Protestant evangelicals in Britain and the United States emerged. To these groups, slavery became "repugnant to our religion" and a "crime in the sight of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Abolition of the Atlantic Slave Trade|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|year=1981|isbn=|editor-last=Eltis|editor-first=David|location=Madison|pages=76|editor-last2=Walvin|editor-first2=James}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas added to those expressed by Enlightenment thinkers, leading many in Britain to believe that slavery was "not only morally wrong and economically inefficient, but also politically unwise."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Atlantic Slave Trade|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=2002|isbn=|editor-last=Northrup|editor-first=David|location=Boston|pages=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; As these notions gained more adherents, Britain was forced to end its participation in the slave trade.

===Enlightened absolutism===
{{Main|Enlightened absolutism}}
[[File:Retrato_do_Marques_de_Pombal.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal|Marquis of Pombal]], as the head of the government of Portugal, implemented sweeping socio-economic reforms (abolished [[Slavery in Portugal|slavery]], significantly weakened the [[Portuguese Inquisition|Inquisition]], created the basis for secular public schools and restructured the tax system), effectively ruling as a powerful, progressive dictator]]

The leaders of the Enlightenment were not especially democratic, as they more often look to absolute monarchs as the key to imposing reforms designed by the intellectuals. Voltaire despised democracy and said the absolute monarch must be enlightened and must act as dictated by reason and justice – in other words, be a "philosopher-king".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=David Williams |title=Voltaire: Political Writings |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LV7GZhQEULEC&amp;pg=PR14 |year=1994 |pages=xiv–xv |isbn=9780521437271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Struensee - miniature portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Denmark's minister [[Johann Friedrich Struensee|Johann Struensee]], a social reformer, was publicly executed in 1772]]

In several nations, rulers welcomed leaders of the Enlightenment at court and asked them to help design laws and programs to reform the system, typically to build stronger states. These rulers are called "enlightened despots" by historians.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Lee, ''Aspects of European history, 1494–1789'' (1990) pp.&amp;nbsp;258–66&lt;/ref&gt; They included [[Frederick the Great]] of Prussia, [[Catherine the Great]] of Russia, [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] of [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]] and [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] of Austria. Joseph was over-enthusiastic, announcing many reforms that had little support so that revolts broke out and his regime became a comedy of errors and nearly all his programs were reversed.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Henderson, "Joseph II", ''History Today'' (March 1991) 41:21–27&lt;/ref&gt; Senior ministers [[Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquess of Pombal|Pombal in Portugal]] and [[Johann Friedrich Struensee]] in Denmark also governed according to Enlightenment ideals. In Poland, the model [[Constitution of May 3, 1791|constitution of 1791]] expressed Enlightenment ideals, but was in effect for only one year before [[Second Partition of Poland|the nation was partitioned]] among its neighbors. More enduring were the cultural achievements, which created a nationalist spirit in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;John Stanley, "Towards A New Nation: The Enlightenment and National Revival in Poland", ''Canadian Review of Studies in Nationalism'', 1983, Vol. 10 Issue 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;83–110&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frederick the Great]], the king of [[Prussia]] from 1740 to 1786, saw himself as a leader of the Enlightenment and patronized philosophers and scientists at his court in Berlin. Voltaire, who had been imprisoned and maltreated by the French government, was eager to accept Frederick's invitation to live at his palace. Frederick explained: "My principal occupation is to combat ignorance and prejudice&amp;nbsp;... to enlighten minds, cultivate morality, and to make people as happy as it suits human nature, and as the means at my disposal permit".&lt;ref&gt;Giles MacDonogh, ''Frederick the Great: A Life in Deed and Letters'' (2001) p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;

===French Revolution===
The Enlightenment has been frequently linked to the [[French Revolution]] of 1789. One view of the political changes that occurred during the Enlightenment is that the "[[consent of the governed]]" philosophy as delineated by Locke in ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'' (1689) represented a paradigm shift from the old governance paradigm under feudalism known as the "[[divine right of kings]]". In this view, the revolutions of the late 1700s and early 1800s were caused by the fact that this governance paradigm shift often could not be resolved peacefully and therefore violent revolution was the result. Clearly a governance philosophy where the king was never wrong was in direct conflict with one whereby citizens by natural law had to consent to the acts and rulings of their government.

[[Alexis de Tocqueville]] proposed the French Revolution as the inevitable result of the radical opposition created in the 18th century between the monarchy and the men of letters of the Enlightenment. These men of letters constituted a sort of "substitute aristocracy that was both all-powerful and without real power". This illusory power came from the rise of "public opinion", born when absolutist centralization removed the nobility and the bourgeoisie from the political sphere. The "literary politics" that resulted promoted a discourse of equality and was hence in fundamental opposition to the monarchical regime.&lt;ref&gt;Chartier, 8. See also Alexis de Tocqueville, ''L'Ancien Régime et la Révolution'', 1850, Book Three, Chapter One.&lt;/ref&gt; De Tocqueville "clearly designates&amp;nbsp; ... the cultural effects of transformation in the forms of the exercise of power".&lt;ref&gt;Chartier, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
Enlightenment era religious commentary was a response to the preceding century of religious conflict in Europe, especially the [[Thirty Years' War]].&lt;ref&gt;Margaret C. Jacob, ed. ''The Enlightenment: Brief History with Documents'', Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2001, Introduction, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–72.&lt;/ref&gt; Theologians of the Enlightenment wanted to reform their faith to its generally non-confrontational roots and to limit the capacity for religious controversy to spill over into politics and warfare while still maintaining a true faith in [[God]]. For moderate Christians, this meant a return to simple Scripture. John Locke abandoned the corpus of theological commentary in favor of an "unprejudiced examination" of the Word of God alone. He determined the essence of [[Christianity]] to be a belief in [[Christ]] the redeemer and recommended avoiding more detailed debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Locke |title=Reasonableness of Christianity |volume= "Preface" The Reasonableness of Christianity, as delivered in the Scriptures |year= 1695}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Jefferson Bible]]'', [[Thomas Jefferson]] went further and dropped any passages dealing with miracles, visitations of angels and the [[resurrection of Jesus]] after [[Crucifixion of Jesus|his death]], as he tried to extract the practical Christian moral code of the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=R. B. Bernstein|title=Thomas Jefferson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4vrD1WKLicwC&amp;pg=PA179|year= 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=179|isbn=9780199758449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enlightenment scholars sought to curtail the political power of [[organized religion]] and thereby prevent another age of intolerant religious war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ole Peter Grell|author2=Roy Porter|title=Toleration in Enlightenment Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JPTdIQBIvS0C|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=1–68|isbn=9780521651967}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spinoza]] determined to remove politics from contemporary and historical theology (e.g., disregarding [[Halakha|Judaic law]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Baruch Spinoza]], ''Theologico-Political Treatise,'' "Preface," 1677, [http://www.gutenburg.com gutenberg.com]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moses Mendelssohn]] advised affording no political weight to any organized religion, but instead recommended that each person follow what they found most convincing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Moses |last=Mendelssohn |title=Jerusalem: Or on Religious Power and Judaism|year= 1783 |url= http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/mendelssohn1782.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believed a good religion based in instinctive [[Morality|morals]] and a belief in God should not theoretically need force to maintain order in its believers, and both Mendelssohn and Spinoza judged religion on its moral fruits, not the logic of its theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Willi Goetschel|title=Spinoza's Modernity: Mendelssohn, Lessing, and Heine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CYcOfkrduWYC&amp;pg=PA126|year=2004|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|page=126|isbn=9780299190835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of novel ideas about religion developed with the Enlightenment, including [[deism]] and talk of [[atheism]]. According to [[Thomas Paine]], deism is the simple belief in [[Creator deity|God the Creator]], with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Paine, ''Of the Religion of Deism Compared with the Christian Religion,'' 1804, Internet History Sourcebook&lt;/ref&gt; which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ellen Judy Wilson|author2=Peter Hanns Reill|title=Encyclopedia Of The Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1pQ4YG-TDIC&amp;pg=PA148|year=2004|publisher=Infobase Publishing|page=148|isbn=9781438110219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note: "In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wilson and Reill|title=Encyclopedia Of The Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1pQ4YG-TDIC&amp;pg=PA26|year=2004|publisher=Infobase Publishing|page=26|isbn=9781438110219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Pagden|title=The Enlightenment: And Why it Still Matters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GnURng7tsWIC&amp;pg=PA100|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=100|isbn=9780199660933}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined. That is, since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law and had no fear of eternal consequences, they were far more likely to disrupt society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stuart Brown|title=British Philosophy and the Age of Enlightenment: Routledge History of Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EoIafbj8pFgC&amp;pg=PA256|year=2003|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=256|isbn=9780415308779}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bayle (1647–1706) observed that, in his day, "prudent persons will always maintain an appearance of [religion]," and he believed that even atheists could hold concepts of honor and go beyond their own self-interest to create and interact in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pierre Bayle|title=A general dictionary: historical and critical: in which a new and accurate translation of that of the celebrated Mr. Bayle, with the corrections and observations printed in the late edition at Paris, is included; and interspersed with several thousand lives never before published.

He would be a god to himself, and the satisfaction of his own will the sole measure and end of all his actions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/23410-god-locke-and-equality-christian-foundations-of-locke-s-political-thought/|title=God, Locke and Equality: Christian Foundations of Locke's Political Thought|author=ENR // AgencyND // University of Notre Dame|work=nd.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Separation of church and state===
{{main|Separation of church and state|Separation of church and state in the United States}}
The "Radical Enlightenment"{{sfn|Israel|2011|pp=11}}{{sfn|Israel|2010|p=19}} promoted the concept of separating church and state,{{sfn|Israel|2010|pp=vii–viii}} an idea that is often credited to English philosopher [[John Locke]] (1632–1704).&lt;ref name=AFP&gt;Feldman, Noah (2005). ''Divided by God''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, p. 29 ("It took [[John Locke]] to translate the demand for liberty of conscience into a systematic argument for distinguishing the realm of government from the realm of religion.")&lt;/ref&gt; According to his principle of the [[social contract]], Locke said that the government lacked authority in the realm of individual conscience, as this was something rational people could not cede to the government for it or others to control. For Locke, this created a natural right in the liberty of conscience, which he said must therefore remain protected from any government authority.

These views on religious tolerance and the importance of individual conscience, along with the social contract, became particularly influential in the American colonies and the drafting of the United States Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Noah (2005). ''Divided by God''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Jefferson]] called for a "wall of separation between church and state" at the federal level. He previously had supported successful efforts to disestablish the [[Church of England]] in Virginia&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ferling2000|Ferling, 2000]], p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; and authored the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mayer|Mayer, 1994]] p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson's political ideals were greatly influenced by the writings of [[John Locke]], [[Francis Bacon]], and [[Isaac Newton]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kayes|Hayes, 2008]], p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; whom he considered the three greatest men that ever lived.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cogliano|Cogliano, 2003]], p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

==National variations==
[[File:Europe, 1700 - 1714.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Europe at the beginning of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], 1700]]

The Enlightenment took hold in most European countries, often with a specific local emphasis. For example, in France it became associated with anti-government and anti-Church radicalism, while in Germany it reached deep into the middle classes, where it expressed a spiritualistic and nationalistic tone without threatening governments or established churches.&lt;ref&gt;David N. Livingstone and Charles W. J. Withers, ''Geography and Enlightenment'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Government responses varied widely. In France, the government was hostile, and the ''philosophes''&lt;!-- "philosophes" is correct --&gt; fought against its censorship, sometimes being imprisoned or hounded into exile. The British government, for the most part, ignored the Enlightenment's leaders in England and Scotland, although it did give Isaac Newton a knighthood and a very lucrative government office.

===Great Britain===
====England====
{{Further|Georgian era#English Enlightenment}}
The very existence of an English Enlightenment has been hotly debated by scholars. The majority of textbooks on British history make little or no mention of an English Enlightenment. Some surveys of the entire Enlightenment include England and others ignore it, although they do include coverage of such major intellectuals as Joseph Addison, Edward Gibbon, John Locke, Isaac Newton, Alexander Pope, Joshua Reynolds and Jonathan Swift.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ed.  ''The Enlightenment: A comprehensive anthology'' (1973) p 14&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Porter]] argues that the reasons for this neglect were the assumptions that the movement was primarily French-inspired, that it was largely a-religious or anti-clerical, and that it stood in outspoken defiance to the established order.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter, "England" in Alan Charles Kors, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment'' (2003) 1:409–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Porter admits that, after the 1720s, England could claim thinkers to equal Diderot, Voltaire or Rousseau. However, its leading intellectuals such as [[Edward Gibbon]],&lt;ref&gt;Karen O'Brien, "English Enlightenment Histories, 1750–c.1815"  in {{cite book|editor=José Rabasa |title=The Oxford History of Historical Writing: Volume 3: 1400-1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HcVZeiGg4awC&amp;pg=PA518|year=2012|publisher=OUP Oxford|pages=518–35 |isbn=9780199219179}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmund Burke]] and [[Samuel Johnson]] were all quite conservative and supportive of the standing order. Porter says the reason was that Enlightenment had come early to England and had succeeded so that the culture had accepted political liberalism, philosophical empiricism, and religious toleration of the sort that intellectuals on the continent had to fight for against powerful odds. Furthermore, England rejected the collectivism of the continent and emphasized the improvement of individuals as the main goal of enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter, ''The creation of the modern world: the untold story of the British Enlightenment'' (2000), pp 1–12, 482–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|thumb|left|upright|One leader of the Scottish Enlightenment was [[Adam Smith]], the father of modern economic science]]

====Scotland====
{{Further|Scottish Enlightenment}}
In the Scottish Enlightenment, Scotland's major cities created an intellectual infrastructure of mutually supporting institutions such as universities, reading societies, libraries, periodicals, museums and masonic lodges.{{sfn|Israel|2011|pp=248–49}} The Scottish network was "predominantly liberal Calvinist, Newtonian, and 'design' oriented in character which played a major role in the further development of the transatlantic Enlightenment".&lt;ref name="HermanTwo"&gt;A. Herman, ''How the Scots Invented the Modern World'' (Crown Publishing Group, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; In France, [[Voltaire]] said that "we look to Scotland for all our ideas of civilization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=Lawrence E.|title=Jews, Confucians, and Protestants: Cultural Capital and the End of Multiculturalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rbqn4RfUMioC&amp;pg=PA92|year=2012|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=92|isbn=9781442219649}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of the Scottish Enlightenment ranged from intellectual and economic matters to the specifically scientific as in the work of [[William Cullen]], physician and chemist; [[James Anderson of Hermiston|James Anderson]], an [[agronomist]]; [[Joseph Black]], physicist and chemist; and [[James Hutton]], the first modern geologist.&lt;ref name="Denby"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Repcheck"&gt;J.

Several Americans, especially [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]], played a major role in bringing Enlightenment ideas to the New World and in influencing British and French thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;Henry F. May, ''The Enlightenment in America'' (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin was influential for his political activism and for his advances in physics.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Atiyah, "Benjamin Franklin and the Edinburgh Enlightenment," ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' (Dec 2006) 150#4 pp.&amp;nbsp;591–606.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jack Fruchtman, Jr., ''Atlantic Cousins: Benjamin Franklin and His Visionary Friends'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The cultural exchange during the Age of Enlightenment ran in both directions across the Atlantic. Thinkers such as Paine, Locke and Rousseau all take Native American cultural practices as examples of natural freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Charles C. Mann, ''1491'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The Americans closely followed English and Scottish political ideas, as well as some French thinkers such as [[Montesquieu]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul M. Spurlin, ''Montesquieu in America, 1760–1801'' (1941)&lt;/ref&gt; As deists, they were influenced by ideas of John Toland (1670–1722) and Matthew Tindal (1656–1733). During the Enlightenment there was a great emphasis upon [[Liberalism in the United States|liberty]], [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] and [[Freedom of religion in the United States|religious tolerance]]. There was no respect for monarchy or inherited political power.  Deists reconciled science and religion by rejecting prophecies, miracles and Biblical theology. Leading deists included [[Thomas Paine]] in ''[[The Age of Reason]]'' and by Thomas Jefferson in his short ''[[Jefferson Bible]]'' – from which all supernatural aspects were removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1272214/The-Founding-Fathers-Deism-and-Christianity|title=The Founding Fathers, Deism, and Christianity|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===German states===
{{Further|History of Germany#Enlightenment}}Prussia took the lead among the German states in sponsoring the political reforms that Enlightenment thinkers urged absolute rulers to adopt. There were important movements as well in the smaller states of Bavaria, Saxony, Hanover and the Palatinate. In each case, Enlightenment values became accepted and led to significant political and administrative reforms that laid the groundwork for the creation of modern states.&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Ingrao, "A Pre-Revolutionary Sonderweg." ''German History'' 20#3 (2002), pp 279-286.&lt;/ref&gt; The princes of Saxony, for example, carried out an impressive series of fundamental fiscal, administrative, judicial, educational, cultural and general economic reforms. The reforms were aided by the country's strong urban structure and influential commercial groups and modernized pre-1789 Saxony along the lines of classic Enlightenment principles.&lt;ref&gt;Katrin Keller, "Saxony: Rétablissement and Enlightened Absolutism." ''German History'' 20.3 (2002): 309-331.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oer-Weimarer Musenhof.jpg|thumb|left|''Weimar’s Courtyard of the Muses'', a tribute to [[The Enlightenment]] and the [[Weimar Classicism]] depicting German poets [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], [[Christoph Martin Wieland|Wieland]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]]]
Before 1750, the German upper classes looked to France for intellectual, cultural and architectural leadership, as French was the language of high society. By the mid-18th century, the ''Aufklärung'' ([[The Enlightenment]]) had transformed German high culture in music, philosophy, science and literature. [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] (1679–1754) was the pioneer as a writer who expounded the Enlightenment to German readers and legitimized German as a philosophic language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=John G. | last=Gagliardo | title=Germany under the Old Regime, 1600–1790 | year=1991 | pages=217–34, 375–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johann Gottfried von Herder]] (1744–1803) broke new ground in philosophy and poetry, as a leader of the [[Sturm und Drang]] movement of proto-Romanticism. [[Weimar Classicism]] (''Weimarer Klassik'') was a cultural and literary movement based in Weimar that sought to establish a new humanism by synthesizing Romantic, classical and Enlightenment ideas. The movement (from 1772 until 1805) involved Herder as well as polymath [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] (1749–1832) and [[Friedrich Schiller]] (1759–1805), a poet and historian. Herder argued that every folk had its own particular identity, which was expressed in its language and culture. This legitimized the promotion of German language and culture and helped shape the development of German nationalism. Schiller's plays expressed the restless spirit of his generation, depicting the hero's struggle against social pressures and the force of destiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | editor-first=Simon J. |editor-last=Richter | title=The Literature of Weimar Classicism | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German music, sponsored by the upper classes, came of age under composers [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (1685–1750), [[Joseph Haydn]] (1732–1809) and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] (1756–1791).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-first=Samantha | editor-last=Owens | editor2-last =Reul | editor2-first =Barbara M. | editor3-last =Stockigt | editor3-first =Janice B. | title=Music at German Courts, 1715–1760: Changing Artistic Priorities | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In remote [[Königsberg]], philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) tried to reconcile rationalism and religious belief, individual freedom and political authority. Kant's work contained basic tensions that would continue to shape German thought – and indeed all of European philosophy – well into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Manfred | last=Kuehn | title=Kant: A Biography | year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German Enlightenment won the support of princes, aristocrats and the middle classes and it permanently reshaped the culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-first=Richard |editor-last=Van Dulmen | editor2-first=Anthony | editor2-last=Williams | title=The Society of the Enlightenment: The Rise of the Middle Class and Enlightenment Culture in Germany | year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was a conservatism among the elites that warned against going too far.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas P. Saine, ''The Problem of Being Modern, or the German Pursuit of Enlightenment from Leibniz to the French Revolution'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1780s, Lutheran ministers  [[Johann Heinrich Schulz]] and Karl Wilhelm Brumbey got in trouble with their preaching as they were attacked and ridiculed by Immanuel Kant, [[Wilhelm Abraham Teller]] and others. In 1788, Prussia issued an "Edict on Religion" that forbade preaching any sermon that undermined popular belief in the Holy Trinity and the Bible. The goal was to avoid skepticism, deism and theological disputes that might impinge on domestic tranquility. Men who doubted the value of Enlightenment favoured the measure, but so too did many supporters. German universities had created a closed elite that could debate controversial issues among themselves, but spreading them to the public was seen as too risky. This intellectual elite was favoured by the state, but that might be reversed if the process of the Enlightenment proved politically or socially destabilizing.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Sauter, "The Enlightenment on trial: state service and social discipline in eighteenth-century Germany's public sphere." ''Modern Intellectual History'' 5.2 (2008): 195-223.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
The Enlightenment played a distinctive, if small, role in the history of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Dino Carpanetto and Giuseppe Ricuperati, ''Italy in the Age of Reason, 1685-1789'' (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burr Litchfield, "Italy" in Kors, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment'' (2003) 2:270-76&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of Italy was controlled by conservative Habsburgs or the pope, Tuscany had some opportunities for reform. [[Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Leopold II of Tuscany]] abolished the death penalty in Tuscany and reduced censorship. From Naples, [[Antonio Genovesi]] (1713–69) influenced a generation of southern Italian intellectuals and university students. His textbook "Diceosina, o Sia della Filosofia del Giusto e dell'Onesto" (1766) was a controversial attempt to mediate between the history of moral philosophy on the one hand and the specific problems encountered by 18th-century commercial society on the other. It contained the greater part of Genovesi's political, philosophical and economic thought – guidebook for Neapolitan economic and social development.&lt;ref&gt;Niccolò Guasti,  "Antonio genovesi's Diceosina: Source of the Neapolitan Enlightenment." ''History of European ideas''  32.4 (2006): 385-405.&lt;/ref&gt; Science flourished as [[Alessandro Volta]] and [[Luigi Galvani]] made break-through discoveries in electricity. [[Pietro Verri]] was a leading economist in Lombardy. Historian [[Joseph Schumpeter]] states he was "the most important pre-Smithian authority on Cheapness-and-Plenty".&lt;ref&gt;Pier Luigi Porta, "Lombard enlightenment and classical political economy." ''The European Journal of the History of Economic Thought'' 18.4 (2011): 521-550.&lt;/ref&gt; The most influential scholar on the Italian Enlightenment has been [[Franco Venturi]].&lt;ref&gt;Franco Venturi, ''Italy and the Enlightenment: studies in a cosmopolitan century'' (1972) [https://archive.org/details/italyenlightenme00vent online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anna Maria Rao, "Enlightenment and reform: an overview of culture and politics in Enlightenment Italy." ''Journal of Modern Italian Studies'' 10.2 (2005): 142-167.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
In Russia, the government began to actively encourage the proliferation of arts and sciences in the mid-18th century. This era produced the first Russian university, library, theatre, public museum and independent press. Like other [[enlightened absolutism|enlightened despots]], [[Catherine the Great]] played a key role in fostering the arts, sciences and education. She used her own interpretation of Enlightenment ideals, assisted by notable international experts such as Voltaire (by correspondence) and in residence world class scientists such as [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Peter Simon Pallas]]. The national Enlightenment differed from its Western European counterpart in that it promoted further [[modernization]] of all aspects of Russian life and was concerned with attacking the institution of [[serfdom in Russia]]. The Russian enlightenment centered on the individual instead of societal enlightenment and encouraged the living of an enlightened life.&lt;ref&gt;Elise Kimerling Wirtschafter, "Thoughts on the Enlightenment and Enlightenment in Russia", ''Modern Russian History &amp; Historiography'', 2009, Vol. 2 Issue 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–26&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Israel|2011|pp=609–632}} A powerful element was ''prosveshchenie'' which combined religious piety, erudition and commitment to the spread of learning. However, it lacked the skeptical and critical spirit of the European Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Colum Leckey,  "What is Prosveshchenie? Nikolai Novikov's Historical Dictionary of Russian Writers Revisited." ''Russian History'' 37.4 (2010): 360-377.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland===
{{Main|Enlightenment in Poland}}
Enlightenment ideas (''oświecenie'') emerged late in [[History of Poland|Poland]], as the Polish middle class  was weaker and [[szlachta]] (nobility) culture ([[Sarmatism]]) together with the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] political system ([[Golden Liberty]]) were in deep crisis. The political system was built on [[republicanism]], but was unable to defend itself against powerful neighbors Russia, Prussia and Austria as they repeatedly sliced off regions until nothing was left of independent Poland. The period of Polish Enlightenment began in the 1730s–1740s and especially in theatre and the arts peaked in the reign of King [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]] (second half of the 18th century). Warsaw was a main centre after 1750, with an expansion of schools and educational institutions and the arts patronage held at the Royal Castle.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Janowski, "Warsaw and Its Intelligentsia: Urban Space and Social Change, 1750-1831." ''Acta Poloniae Historica'' 100 (2009): 57-77.&lt;/ref&gt; Leaders promoted tolerance and more education. They included King Stanislaw II Poniatowski and reformers Piotr Switkowski, Antoni Poplawski, Josef Niemcewicz and Jósef Pawlinkowski, as well as Baudouin de Cortenay, a Polonized dramatist. Opponents included Florian Jaroszewicz, Gracjan Piotrowski, Karol Wyrwicz and Wojciech Skarszewski.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Butterwick, "What is Enlightenment (oświecenie)? Some Polish Answers, 1765–1820."

The movement went into decline with the [[Third Partition of Poland]] (1795) – a national tragedy inspiring a short period of sentimental writing – and ended in 1822, replaced by [[Romanticism in Poland|Romanticism]].&lt;ref name="JS"&gt;Jerzy Snopek, [http://f.poland.pl/files/86/0/234/Literature_of_Enlightenment.pdf  "The Polish Literature of the Enlightenment."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005232247/http://f.poland.pl/files/86/0/234/Literature_of_Enlightenment.pdf |date=2011-10-05 }} (PDF 122 KB) ''Poland.pl.'' {{nowrap|Retrieved October 7, 2011.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==
The Enlightenment has always been contested territory. According to Keith Thomas, its supporters "hail it as the source of everything that is progressive about the modern world. For them, it stands for freedom of thought, rational inquiry, critical thinking, religious tolerance, political liberty, scientific achievement, the pursuit of happiness, and hope for the future."&lt;ref&gt;Keith Thomas, "The Great Fight Over the Enlightenment," [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/apr/03/great-fight-over-enlightenment/ ''The New York Review'' April 3, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas adds that its detractors accuse it of shallow rationalism, naïve optimism, unrealistic universalism and moral darkness. From the start, conservative and clerical defenders of traditional religion attacked materialism and skepticism as evil forces that encouraged immorality. By 1794, they pointed to [[the Terror]] during the French Revolution as confirmation of their predictions. As the Enlightenment was ending, Romantic philosophers argued that excessive dependence on reason was a mistake perpetuated by the Enlightenment because it disregarded the bonds of history, myth, faith, and tradition that were necessary to hold society together.&lt;ref name="Thomas, 2014"&gt;Thomas, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definition===
The term "Enlightenment" emerged in English in the later part of the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'',  3rd Edn (revised)&lt;/ref&gt; with particular reference to French philosophy, as the equivalent of the French term ''Lumières'' (used first by Dubos in 1733 and already well established by 1751). From [[Immanuel Kant]]'s 1784 essay "Beantwortung der Frage: Was ist Aufklärung?" ("[[Answering the Question: What is Enlightenment?]]"), the German term became ''Aufklärun''g (''aufklären'' = to illuminate; ''sich aufklären'' = to clear up). However, scholars have never agreed on a definition of the Enlightenment, or on its chronological or geographical extent. Terms like ''les Lumières'' ([[French language|French]]), ''illuminism''o ([[Italian language|Italian]]), ''ilustración'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]) and ''Aufklärung'' ([[German language|German]]) referred to partly overlapping movements. Not until the late nineteenth century did English scholars agree they were talking about "the Enlightenment".&lt;ref name="Thomas, 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John |last=Lough |title=Reflections on Enlightenment and Lumieres |publisher=Journal for Eighteenth-Century Studies |year=1985 |volume= 8#1 |pages= 1–15 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1754-0208.1985.tb00093.x/full |doi=10.1111/j.1754-0208.1985.tb00093.x |journal=Journal for Eighteenth-Century Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Encyclopedie frontispice full.jpg|thumb|If there is something you know, communicate it. If there is something you don't know, search for it.&lt;div style="text-align:right;"&gt;— An engraving from the 1772 edition of the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''; [[Truth]], in the top center, is surrounded by light and unveiled by the figures to the right, [[Philosophy]] and [[Reason]]&lt;/div&gt;]]

Enlightenment [[historiography]] began in the period itself, from what Enlightenment figures said about their work. A dominant element was the intellectual angle they took. [[D'Alembert's]] ''Preliminary Discourse of l'Encyclopédie'' provides a history of the Enlightenment which comprises a chronological list of developments in the realm of knowledge – of which the ''Encyclopédie'' forms the pinnacle.&lt;ref&gt;Jean le Rond d'Alembert, ''Discours préliminaire de l'Encyclopédie''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1783, Jewish philosopher [[Moses Mendelssohn]] referred to Enlightenment as a process by which man was educated in the use of reason.&lt;ref&gt;Outram, 1. The past tense is used deliberately as whether man would educate himself or be educated by certain exemplary figures was a common issue at the time. D'Alembert's introduction to l'Encyclopédie, for example, along with Immanuel Kant's essay response (the "independent thinkers"), both support the later model.&lt;/ref&gt; Immanuel Kant called Enlightenment "man's release from his self-incurred tutelage", tutelage being "man's inability to make use of his understanding without direction from another".&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, "What is Enlightenment?", 1.&lt;/ref&gt; "For Kant, Enlightenment was mankind's final coming of age, the emancipation of the human consciousness from an immature state of ignorance".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Porter|2001|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German scholar [[Ernst Cassirer]] called the Enlightenment "a part and a special phase of that whole intellectual development through which modern philosophic thought gained its characteristic self-confidence and self-consciousness".&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Cassirer, ''The Philosophy of the Enlightenment'', (1951), p. vi&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Roy Porter]], the liberation of the human mind from a dogmatic state of ignorance is the epitome of what the Age of Enlightenment was trying to capture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Porter|2001|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] saw the Enlightenment as a phase in a progressive development which began in antiquity and that reason and challenges to the established order were constant ideals throughout that time.&lt;ref name="Russell, Bertrand p492-494"&gt;Russell, Bertrand. ''A History of Western Philosophy''. pp.&amp;nbsp;492–94&lt;/ref&gt; Russell said that the Enlightenment was ultimately born out of the Protestant reaction against the Catholic [[counter-reformation]] and that philosophical views such as affinity for democracy against monarchy originated among 16th-century Protestants to justify their desire to break away from the Catholic Church. Although many of these philosophical ideals were picked up by Catholics, Russell argues that by the 18th century the Enlightenment was the principal manifestation of the schism that began with [[Martin Luther]].&lt;ref name="Russell, Bertrand p492-494"/&gt;

Jonathan Israel rejects the attempts of postmodern and Marxian historians to understand the revolutionary ideas of the period purely as by-products of social and economic transformations.{{sfn|Israel|2010|pp=49–50}} He instead focuses on the [[history of ideas]] in the period from 1650 to the end of the 18th century and claims that it was the ideas themselves that caused the change that eventually led to the revolutions of the latter half of the 18th century and the early 19th century.{{sfn|Israel|2006|pp=v–viii}} Israel argues that until the 1650s Western civilization "was based on a largely shared core of faith, tradition and authority".{{sfn|Israel|2001|pp=3}}

===Time span===
There is little consensus on the precise beginning of the Age of Enlightenment, though the beginning of the 18th century (1701) or the middle of the 17th century (1650) are often used as [[epoch (reference date)|epochs]]. French historians usually place the period, called the ''Siècle des Lumières'' ("Century of Enlightenments"), between 1715 and 1789, from the beginning of the reign of [[Louis XV]] until the [[French Revolution]]. If taken back to the mid-17th century, the Enlightenment would trace its origins to [[René Descartes|Descartes]]' ''[[Discourse on the Method]]'', published in 1637. In France, many cited the publication of [[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'' in 1687.&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Shank, ''The Newton Wars and the Beginning of the French Enlightenment'' (2008), "Introduction"&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued by several historians and philosophers that the beginning of the Enlightenment is when Descartes shifted the epistemological basis from external authority to internal certainty by his ''[[cogito ergo sum]]'' published in 1637.&lt;ref name="Heidegger1938emancipated"&gt;Martin Heidegger [1938] (2002) ''The Age of the World Picture'' quotation: {{quote|For up to Descartes&amp;nbsp;... a particular ''sub-iectum''&amp;nbsp;... lies at the foundation of its own fixed qualities and changing circumstances. The superiority of a ''sub-iectum''&amp;nbsp;... arises out of the claim of man to a&amp;nbsp;... self-supported, unshakeable foundation of truth, in the sense of certainty. Why and how does this claim acquire its decisive authority? The claim originates in that emancipation of man in which he frees himself from obligation to Christian revelational truth and Church doctrine to a legislating for himself that takes its stand upon itself.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ingraffia95p126"&gt;Ingraffia, Brian D. (1995) [https://books.google.com/books?id=LHjZYbOLG8cC&amp;pg=PA126 ''Postmodern theory and biblical theology: vanquishing God's shadow''] p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman K. Swazo (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=INP_cy6Mu7EC&amp;pg=PA97 ''Crisis theory and world order: Heideggerian reflections''] pp. 97–99&lt;/ref&gt; As to its end, most scholars use the last years of the century, often choosing the French Revolution of 1789 or the beginning of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1804–1815) as a convenient point in time with which to date the end of the Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/enlightenment_age.html |title=The age of Enlightenment |author=Frost, Martin |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010041056/http://www.martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/enlightenment_age.html |archivedate=2007-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern study===
In the 1944 book ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'', [[Frankfurt School]] philosophers [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Theodor W. Adorno]] argued: &lt;blockquote&gt;Enlightenment, understood in the widest sense as the advance of thought, has always aimed at liberating human beings from fear and installing them as masters. Yet the wholly enlightened earth radiates under the sign of disaster triumphant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dialectic of Enlightenment: Philosophical Fragments|year=1947|author1=Theodor W. Adorno|author2=Max Horkheimer|editor=G. S. Noerr|translator=E. Jephcott|location=Stanford|publisher=Stanford University Press |chapter=The Concept of Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lwVjsKcHW7cC&amp;pg=PA3 |page=3|isbn=9781859841549}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Extending Horkheimer and Adorno's argument, intellectual historian Jason Josephson-Storm has argued that any idea of the Age of Enlightenment as a clearly defined period that is separate from the earlier [[Renaissance]] and later [[Romanticism]] or [[Counter-Enlightenment]] constitutes a myth. Josephson-Storm points out that there are vastly different and mutually contradictory periodizations of the Enlightenment depending on nation, field of study, and school of thought; that the term and category of "Enlightenment" referring to the scientific revolution was actually applied after the fact; that the Enlightenment did not see an increase in [[disenchantment]] or the dominance of the [[mechanistic worldview]]; and that a blur in the early modern ideas of the [[Humanities]] and [[natural sciences]] makes it hard to circumscribe a Scientific Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |pages = 58–61 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Josephson-Storm defends his categorization of the Enlightenment as "myth" by noting the regulative role ideas of a period of Enlightenment and disenchantment play in modern Western culture, such that belief in magic, spiritualism, and even religion appears somewhat taboo in intellectual strata.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |pages = 61–2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, study of the Enlightenment expanded to include the ways Enlightenment ideas spread to European colonies and how they interacted with indigenous cultures and how the Enlightenment took place in formerly unstudied areas such as Italy, Greece, the Balkans, Poland, Hungary and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Outram, 6. See also, A. Owen Alridge (ed.), ''The Ibero-American Enlightenment'' (1971)., Franco Venturi, ''The End of the Old Regime in Europe 1768–1776: The First Crisis''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectuals such as [[Robert Darnton]] and [[Jürgen Habermas]] have focused on the social conditions of the Enlightenment. Habermas described the creation of the "bourgeois public sphere" in 18th-century Europe, containing the new venues and modes of communication allowing for rational exchange. Habermas said that the public sphere was bourgeois, egalitarian, rational and independent from the state, making it the ideal venue for intellectuals to critically examine contemporary politics and society, away from the interference of established authority. While the public sphere is generally an integral component of the social study of the Enlightenment, other historians have questioned whether the public sphere had these characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Robert Darnton, Roger Chartier, Brian Cowan, Donna T. Andrew.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
[[File:Josef II medal.jpg|thumb|A medal minted during the reign of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], commemorating his grant of religious liberty to [[Jews]] and [[Protestants]] in Hungary—another important reform of Joseph II was the abolition of [[serfdom]]]]

In contrast to the intellectual historiographical approach of the Enlightenment, which examines the various currents or discourses of intellectual thought within the European context during the 17th and 18th centuries, the cultural (or social) approach examines the changes that occurred in European society and culture. This approach studies the process of changing sociabilities and cultural practices during the Enlightenment.

One of the primary elements of the culture of the Enlightenment was the rise of the [[public sphere]], a "realm of communication marked by new arenas of debate, more open and accessible forms of urban public space and sociability, and an explosion of print culture", in the late 17th century and 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;James Van Horn Melton, ''The Rise of the Public in Enlightenment Europe'' (2001), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of the public sphere included that it was egalitarian, that it discussed the domain of "common concern," and that argument was founded on reason.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas, ''The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere'', (1989), pp. 36, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas uses the term "common concern" to describe those areas of political/social knowledge and discussion that were previously the exclusive territory of the state and religious authorities, now open to critical examination by the public sphere. The values of this bourgeois public sphere included holding reason to be supreme, considering everything to be open to criticism (the public sphere is [[critical thought|critical]]), and the opposition of secrecy of all sorts.&lt;ref&gt;Melton, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alexandre humboldt.jpg|thumb|left|German explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]] showed his disgust for slavery and often criticized the colonial policies—he always acted out of a deeply humanistic conviction, borne by the ideas of the Enlightenment&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaas A. Rupke (2008). "''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_fXXRzidVKMC#v=onepage Alexander Von Humboldt: A Metabiography]''". University of Chicago Press. p. 138 {{ISBN|0-226-73149-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The creation of the public sphere has been associated with two long-term historical trends: the rise of the modern nation state and the rise of [[capitalism]]. The modern nation state, in its consolidation of public power, created by counterpoint a private realm of society independent of the state, which allowed for the public sphere. Capitalism also increased society's [[autonomy]] and [[self-awareness]], as well as an increasing need for the exchange of information. As the nascent public sphere expanded, it embraced a large variety of [[institutions]] and the most commonly cited were coffee houses and cafés, salons and the literary public sphere, figuratively localized in the Republic of Letters.&lt;ref&gt;Melton, 4, 5. Habermas, 14–26.&lt;/ref&gt; In France, the creation of the public sphere was helped by the aristocracy's move from the King's palace at Versailles to Paris in about 1720, since their rich spending stimulated the trade in luxuries and artistic creations, especially fine paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Daniel Brewer |title=The Cambridge Companion to the French Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mry1BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT91|year=2014|publisher=Cambridge UP|pages=91ff|isbn=9781316194324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The context for the rise of the public sphere was the economic and social change commonly associated with the [[Industrial Revolution]]: "Economic expansion, increasing urbanization, rising population and improving communications in comparison to the stagnation of the previous century".&lt;ref&gt;Outram, Dorinda. ''The Enlightenment'' (2nd ed.). Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Rising efficiency in production techniques and communication lowered the prices of consumer goods and increased the amount and variety of goods available to consumers (including the literature essential to the public sphere). Meanwhile, the colonial experience (most European states had colonial empires in the 18th century) began to expose European society to extremely heterogeneous cultures, leading to the breaking down of "barriers between cultural systems, religious divides, gender differences and geographical areas".&lt;ref&gt;Outram 2005, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "public" implies the highest level of inclusivity – the public sphere by definition should be open to all. However, this sphere was only public to relative degrees. Enlightenment thinkers frequently contrasted their conception of the "public" with that of the people: [[Condorcet]] contrasted "opinion" with populace, [[Jean-François Marmontel|Marmontel]] "the opinion of men of letters" with "the opinion of the multitude" and [[d'Alembert]] the "truly enlightened public" with "the blind and noisy multitude".&lt;ref&gt;Chartier, 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, most institutions of the public sphere excluded both women and the lower classes.&lt;ref&gt;Mona Ozouf, "'Public Opinion' at the End of the Old Regime&lt;/ref&gt; Cross-class influences occurred through noble and lower class participation in areas such as the coffeehouses and the Masonic lodges.

===Social and cultural implications in the arts===
Because of the focus on reason over superstition, the Enlightenment cultivated the arts.&lt;ref&gt;David Beard and Kenneth Gloag, ''Musicology, The Key Concepts'' (New York: Routledge, 2005), 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Emphasis on learning, art and music became more widespread, especially with the growing middle class. Areas of study such as literature, philosophy, science, and the fine arts increasingly explored subject matter to which the general public, in addition to the previously more segregated professionals and patrons, could relate.&lt;ref&gt;J. Peter Burkholder, Donald J. Grout and Claude V. Palisca, ''A History of Western Music, Seventh Edition'', (New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc., 2006), 475.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:George Frideric Handel by Balthasar Denner.jpg|thumb|left|[[George Frideric Handel]]]]
As musicians depended more and more on public support, public concerts became increasingly popular and helped supplement performers' and composers' incomes. The concerts also helped them to reach a wider audience. [[Handel]], for example, epitomized this with his highly public musical activities in [[London]]. He gained considerable fame there with performances of his operas and oratorios. The music of [[Haydn]] and [[Mozart]], with their Viennese Classical styles, are usually regarded as being the most in line with the Enlightenment ideals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Beard and Gloag, ''Musicology'', 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The desire to explore, record and systematize knowledge had a meaningful impact on music publications. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s ''Dictionnaire de musique'' (published 1767 in Geneva and 1768 in Paris) was a leading text in the late 18th century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This widely available dictionary gave short definitions of words like genius and taste and was clearly influenced by the Enlightenment movement. Another text influenced by Enlightenment values was [[Charles Burney]]'s ''A General History of Music: From the Earliest Ages to the Present Period'' (1776), which was a historical survey and an attempt to rationalize elements in music systematically over time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Beard and Gloag, ''Musicology'', 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, musicologists have shown renewed interest in the ideas and consequences of the Enlightenment. For example, [[Rose Rosengard Subotnik]]'s ''Deconstructive Variations'' (subtitled ''Music and Reason in Western Society'') compares Mozart's ''Die Zauberflöte'' (1791) using the Enlightenment and Romantic perspectives and concludes that the work is "an ideal musical representation of the Enlightenment".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

As the economy and the middle class expanded, there was an increasing number of amateur musicians. One manifestation of this involved women, who became more involved with music on a social level. Women were already engaged in professional roles as singers and increased their presence in the amateur performers' scene, especially with keyboard music.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Burkholder, Grout and Palisca, ''A History of Western Music'', 475.&lt;/ref&gt; Music publishers begin to print music that amateurs could understand and play. The majority of the works that were published were for keyboard, voice and keyboard and chamber ensemble.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; After these initial genres were popularized, from the mid-century on, amateur groups sang choral music, which then became a new trend for publishers to capitalize on. The increasing study of the fine arts, as well as access to amateur-friendly published works, led to more people becoming interested in reading and discussing music. Music magazines, reviews and critical works which suited amateurs as well as connoisseurs began to surface.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

==Dissemination of ideas==
The ''philosophes''&lt;!-- "Philosophes" is correct. --&gt; spent a great deal of energy disseminating their ideas among educated men and women in cosmopolitan cities. They used many venues, some of them quite new.

===The Republic of Letters===
{{Main|Republic of Letters}}
[[File:Pierre Bayle.jpg|thumb|left|upright|French philosopher [[Pierre Bayle]]]]
The term "Republic of Letters" was coined in 1664 by [[Pierre Bayle]] in his journal ''Nouvelles de la Republique des Lettres''. Towards the end of the 18th century, the editor of ''Histoire de la République des Lettres en France'', a literary survey, described the Republic of Letters as being: &lt;blockquote&gt;In the midst of all the governments that decide the fate of men; in the bosom of so many states, the majority of them despotic&amp;nbsp;... there exists a certain realm which holds sway only over the mind&amp;nbsp;... that we honour with the name Republic, because it preserves a measure of independence, and because it is almost its essence to be free. It is the realm of talent and of thought.&lt;ref name="Outram, 21"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Republic of Letters was the sum of a number of Enlightenment ideals: an egalitarian realm governed by knowledge that could act across political boundaries and rival state power.&lt;ref name="Outram, 21"/&gt; It was a forum that supported "free public examination of questions regarding religion or legislation".&lt;ref&gt;Chartier, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Immanuel Kant considered written communication essential to his conception of the public sphere; once everyone was a part of the "reading public", then society could be said to be enlightened.&lt;ref&gt;Chartier, 26, 26. Kant, "What is Enlightenment?"&lt;/ref&gt; The people who participated in the Republic of Letters, such as [[Diderot]] and [[Voltaire]], are frequently known today as important Enlightenment figures. Indeed, the men who wrote Diderot's ''Encyclopédie'' arguably formed a microcosm of the larger "republic".&lt;ref&gt;Outram, 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many women played an essential part in the French Enlightenment, due to the role they played as ''salonnières'' in Parisian salons, as the contrast to the male ''philosophes&lt;!-- "philosophes" is correct --&gt;''. The salon was the principal social institution of the republic&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and "became the civil working spaces of the project of Enlightenment". Women, as salonnières, were "the legitimate governors of [the] potentially unruly discourse" that took place within.&lt;ref&gt;Dena Goodman, ''The Republic of Letters: A Cultural History of the French Enlightenment'' (1994), 53.&lt;/ref&gt; While women were marginalized in the public culture of the Old Regime, the French Revolution destroyed the old cultural and economic restraints of patronage and corporatism (guilds), opening French society to female participation, particularly in the literary sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Carla Hesse, ''The Other Enlightenment: How French Women Became Modern'' (2001), 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gentleman's Magazine 1731.JPG|thumb|Front page of ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'', January 1731]]
In France, the established men of letters (''gens de lettres'') had fused with the elites (''les grands'') of French society by the mid-18th century. This led to the creation of an oppositional literary sphere, [[Grub Street]], the domain of a "multitude of versifiers and would-be authors".&lt;ref&gt;Crébillon fils, quoted from Darnton, ''The Literary Underground'', 17.&lt;/ref&gt; These men came to London to become authors, only to discover that the literary market simply could not support large numbers of writers, who in any case were very poorly remunerated by the publishing-bookselling [[guild]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Darnton, ''The Literary Underground'', 19, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The writers of Grub Street, the Grub Street Hacks, were left feeling bitter about the relative success of the men of letters&lt;ref&gt;Darnton, "The Literary Underground", 21, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; and found an outlet for their literature which was typified by the ''libelle''. Written mostly in the form of pamphlets, the ''libelles'' "slandered the court, the Church, the aristocracy, the academies, the salons, everything elevated and respectable, including the monarchy itself".&lt;ref&gt;Darnton, ''The Literary Underground'', 29&lt;/ref&gt; ''Le Gazetier cuirassé'' by Charles Théveneau de Morande was a prototype of the genre. It was Grub Street literature that was most read by the public during the Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Outram, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Darnton, more importantly the Grub Street hacks inherited the "revolutionary spirit" once displayed by the ''philosophes&lt;!-- "philosophes" is correct --&gt;'' and paved the way for the French Revolution by desacralizing figures of political, moral and religious authority in France.&lt;ref&gt;Darnton, ''The Literary Underground'', 35–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The book industry===
[[File:1477-1799 ESTC titles per decade, statistics.png|thumb|[[English Short Title Catalogue|ESTC]] data 1477–1799 by decade given with a regional differentiation]]
The increased consumption of reading materials of all sorts was one of the key features of the "social" Enlightenment. Developments in the Industrial Revolution allowed consumer goods to be produced in greater quantities at lower prices, encouraging the spread of books, pamphlets, newspapers and journals – "media of the transmission of ideas and attitudes". Commercial development likewise increased the demand for information, along with rising populations and increased urbanisation.&lt;ref&gt;Outram, 17, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; However, demand for reading material extended outside of the realm of the commercial and outside the realm of the upper and middle classes, as evidenced by the [[Bibliothèque Bleue]]. Literacy rates are difficult to gauge, but in France the rates doubled over the course of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Darnton, "The Literary Underground", 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting the decreasing influence of religion, the number of books about science and art published in Paris doubled from 1720 to 1780, while the number of books about religion dropped to just one-tenth of the total.{{sfn|Petitfils|2005|pages=99–105}}

Reading underwent serious changes in the 18th century. In particular, Rolf Engelsing has argued for the existence of a ''[[Reading Revolution]]''. Until 1750, reading was done intensively: people tended to own a small number of books and read them repeatedly, often to small audience. After 1750, people began to read "extensively", finding as many books as they could, increasingly reading them alone.&lt;ref&gt;from Outram, 19. See Rolf Engelsing, "Die Perioden der Lesergeschichte in der Neuzeit. Das statische Ausmass und die soziokulturelle Bedeutung der Lektüre", Archiv für Geschichte des Buchwesens, 10 (1969), cols. 944–1002 and Der Bürger als Leser: Lesergeschichte in Deutschland, 1500–1800 (Stuttgart, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported by increasing literacy rates, particularly among women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482597/history-of-publishing/28681/Developments-in-the-18th-century|title=history of publishing :: Developments in the 18th century|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of the reading public could not afford to own a private library and while most of the state-run "universal libraries" set up in the 17th and 18th centuries were open to the public, they were not the only sources of reading material. On one end of the spectrum was the ''Bibliothèque Bleue'', a collection of cheaply produced books published in Troyes, France. Intended for a largely rural and semi-literate audience these books included almanacs, retellings of medieval romances and condensed versions of popular novels, among other things. While some historians have argued against the Enlightenment's penetration into the lower classes, the ''Bibliothèque Bleue'' represents at least a desire to participate in Enlightenment sociability.&lt;ref&gt;Outram, 27–29&lt;/ref&gt; Moving up the classes, a variety of institutions offered readers access to material without needing to buy anything. Libraries that lent out their material for a small price started to appear and occasionally bookstores would offer a small lending library to their patrons. Coffee houses commonly offered books, journals and sometimes even popular novels to their customers. ''[[Tatler (1709)|The Tatler]]'' and ''[[The Spectator]]'', two influential periodicals sold from 1709 to 1714, were closely associated with coffee house culture in London, being both read and produced in various establishments in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Erin Mackie, ''The Commerce of Everyday Life: Selections from The Tatler and The Spectator'' (Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's, 1998), 16.&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of the triple or even quadruple function of the coffee house: reading material was often obtained, read, discussed and even produced on the premises.&lt;ref&gt;See Mackie, Darnton, ''An Early Information Society''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Denis Diderot 111.PNG|thumb|upright|[[Denis Diderot]] is best known as the editor of the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'']]
It is extremely difficult to determine what people actually read during the Enlightenment. For example, examining the catalogs of private libraries gives an image skewed in favor of the classes wealthy enough to afford libraries and also ignores censored works unlikely to be publicly acknowledged. For this reason, a study of publishing would be much more fruitful for discerning reading habits.&lt;ref&gt;In particular, see Chapter 6, "Reading, Writing and Publishing"&lt;/ref&gt;

Across continental Europe, but in France especially, booksellers and publishers had to negotiate censorship laws of varying strictness. For example, the ''Encyclopédie'' narrowly escaped seizure and had to be saved by [[Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes|Malesherbes]], the man in charge of the French censor. Indeed, many publishing companies were conveniently located outside France so as to avoid overzealous French censors. They would smuggle their merchandise across the border, where it would then be transported to clandestine booksellers or small-time peddlers.&lt;ref&gt;See Darnton, ''The Literary Underground'', 184.&lt;/ref&gt; The records of clandestine booksellers may give a better representation of what literate Frenchmen might have truly read, since their clandestine nature provided a less restrictive product choice.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Darnton, ''The Literary Underground'', 135–47.&lt;/ref&gt; In one case, political books were the most popular category, primarily libels and pamphlets. Readers were more interested in sensationalist stories about criminals and political corruption than they were in political theory itself. The second most popular category, "general works" (those books "that did not have a dominant motif and that contained something to offend almost everyone in authority"), demonstrated a high demand for generally low-brow subversive literature. However, these works never became part of literary canon and are largely forgotten today as a result.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

A healthy, legal publishing industry existed throughout Europe, although established publishers and book sellers occasionally ran afoul of the law. For example, the ''Encyclopédie'' condemned not only by the King, but also by Clement XII, nevertheless found its way into print with the help of the aforementioned Malesherbes and creative use of French censorship law.&lt;ref&gt;Darnton, ''The Business of Enlightenment'', 12, 13. For a more detailed description of French censorship laws, see Darnton, ''The Literary Underground''&lt;/ref&gt; However, many works were sold without running into any legal trouble at all. Borrowing records from libraries in England, Germany, and North America indicate that more than 70&amp;nbsp;percent of books borrowed were novels. Less than 1&amp;nbsp;percent of the books were of a religious nature, indicating the general trend of declining religiosity.&lt;ref name="Outram, 21"&gt;Outram, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural history===
{{Main|Natural History}}
[[File:Buffon 1707-1788.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Georges Buffon]] is best remembered for his {{lang|fr|Histoire naturelle}}, a 44 volume encyclopedia describing everything known about the natural world]]
A genre that greatly rose in importance was that of scientific literature. Natural history in particular became increasingly popular among the upper classes. Works of natural history include [[René-Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur]]'s ''Histoire naturelle des insectes'' and [[Jacques Gautier d'Agoty]]'s ''La Myologie complète, ou description de tous les muscles du corps humain'' (1746). Outside [[Ancien Régime|ancien régime]] France, natural history was an important part of medicine and industry, encompassing the fields of botany, zoology, meteorology, hydrology and mineralogy. Students in Enlightenment universities and academies were taught these subjects to prepare them for careers as diverse as medicine and theology. As shown by Matthew Daniel Eddy, natural history in this context was a very middle class pursuit and operated as a fertile trading zone for the interdisciplinary exchange of diverse scientific ideas.&lt;ref name="Eddy 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=The Language of Mineralogy: John Walker, Chemistry and the Edinburgh Medical School, 1750–1800|year=2008|publisher=Ashgate|url=https://www.academia.edu/1112014/The_Language_of_Mineralogy_John_Walker_Chemistry_and_the_Edinburgh_Medical_School_1750-1800_2008_}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The target audience of natural history was French polite society, evidenced more by the specific discourse of the genre than by the generally high prices of its works. Naturalists catered to polite society's desire for erudition – many texts had an explicit instructive purpose. However, natural history was often a political affair. As Emma Spary writes, the classifications used by naturalists "slipped between the natural world and the social&amp;nbsp;... to establish not only the expertise of the naturalists over the natural, but also the dominance of the natural over the social".&lt;ref&gt;Emma Spary, "The 'Nature' of Enlightenment" in ''The Sciences in Enlightened Europe'', William Clark, Jan Golinski, and Steven Schaffer, eds. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999), 281–82.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of taste (''le goût'') was a social indicator: to truly be able to categorize nature, one had to have the proper taste, an ability of discretion shared by all members of polite society. In this way natural history spread many of the scientific developments of the time, but also provided a new source of legitimacy for the dominant class.&lt;ref&gt;Spary, 289–93.&lt;/ref&gt; From this basis, naturalists could then develop their own social ideals based on their scientific works.&lt;ref&gt;See Thomas Laqueur, ''Making sex: body and gender from the Greeks to Freud'' (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific and literary journals===
[[File:1665 journal des scavans title.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Journal des sçavans]]'' was the earliest academic journal published in Europe]]
The first scientific and literary journals were established during the Enlightenment. The first journal, the Parisian ''[[Journal des Sçavans]]'', appeared in 1665. However, it was not until 1682 that periodicals began to be more widely produced. French and Latin were the dominant languages of publication, but there was also a steady demand for material in German and Dutch. There was generally low demand for English publications on the Continent, which was echoed by England's similar lack of desire for French works. Languages commanding less of an international market—such as Danish, Spanish and Portuguese—found journal success more difficult and more often than not a more international language was used instead. French slowly took over Latin's status as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of learned circles. This in turn gave precedence to the publishing industry in Holland, where the vast majority of these French language periodicals were produced.{{sfn|Israel|2001|pp=143–44}}

Jonathan Israel called the journals the most influential cultural innovation of European intellectual culture.{{sfn|Israel|2001|pp=142}} They shifted the attention of the "cultivated public" away from established authorities to novelty and innovation and instead promoted the "enlightened" ideals of toleration and intellectual objectivity. Being a source of knowledge derived from science and reason, they were an implicit critique of existing notions of universal truth monopolized by monarchies, parliaments and religious authorities. They also advanced Christian enlightenment that upheld "the legitimacy of God-ordained authority"—the Bible—in which there had to be agreement between the biblical and natural theories.{{sfn|Israel|2001|pp=150–51}}

===Encyclopedias and dictionaries===
[[File:Encyclopedie de D'Alembert et Diderot - Premiere Page - ENC 1-NA5.jpg|thumb|upright|First page of the ''[[Encyclopedie]]'', published between 1751 and 1766]]
Although the existence of [[dictionaries]] and [[encyclopedia]]s spanned into ancient times, the texts changed from simply defining words in a long running list to far more detailed discussions of those words in 18th-century [[Encyclopedic dictionary|encyclopedic dictionaries]].&lt;ref name="Headrick 2000 144"&gt;Headrick, (2000), p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; The works were part of an Enlightenment movement to systematize knowledge and provide education to a wider audience than the elite. As the 18th century progressed, the content of encyclopedias also changed according to readers' tastes. Volumes tended to focus more strongly on [[secular]] affairs, particularly science and technology, rather than matters of [[theology]].

Along with secular matters, readers also favoured an alphabetical ordering scheme over cumbersome works arranged along thematic lines.&lt;ref name="Headrick 2000 172"&gt;Headrick, (2000), p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on alphabetization, the historian [[Charles Porset]] has said that "as the zero degree of taxonomy, alphabetical order authorizes all reading strategies; in this respect it could be considered an emblem of the Enlightenment". For Porset, the avoidance of thematic and [[hierarchical]] systems thus allows free interpretation of the works and becomes an example of [[egalitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Porter, (2003), pp.&amp;nbsp;249–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Encyclopedias and dictionaries also became more popular during the Age of Enlightenment as the number of educated consumers who could afford such texts began to multiply.&lt;ref name="Headrick 2000 144"/&gt; In the later half of the 18th century, the number of dictionaries and encyclopedias published by decade increased from 63 between 1760 and 1769 to approximately 148 in the decade proceeding the French Revolution (1780–1789).&lt;ref&gt;Headrick, (2000), p. 168)&lt;/ref&gt; Along with growth in numbers, dictionaries and encyclopedias also grew in length, often having multiple print runs that sometimes included in supplemented editions.&lt;ref name="Headrick 2000 172"/&gt;

The first technical dictionary was drafted by [[John Harris (writer)|John Harris]] and entitled ''[[Lexicon technicum|Lexicon Technicum: Or, An Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]]''. Harris' book avoided theological and biographical entries and instead it concentrated on science and technology. Published in 1704, the ''Lexicon technicum'' was the first book to be written in English that took a methodical approach to describing mathematics and commercial [[arithmetic]] along with the physical sciences and [[navigation]]. Other technical dictionaries followed Harris' model, including [[Ephraim Chambers]]' ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'' (1728), which included five editions and was a substantially larger work than Harris'. The [[Book binding|folio]] edition of the work even included foldout engravings. The ''Cyclopaedia'' emphasized Newtonian theories, [[John Locke|Lockean]] philosophy and contained thorough examinations of technologies, such as [[engraving]], [[brewing]] and [[dyeing]]. [[File:ENC SYSTEME FIGURE.jpeg|upright|thumb|left|"[[Figurative system of human knowledge]]", the structure that the ''Encyclopédie'' organised knowledge into—it had three main branches: memory, reason and imagination]] In Germany, practical reference works intended for the uneducated majority became popular in the 18th century. The ''Marperger Curieuses Natur-, Kunst-, Berg-, Gewerkund Handlungs-Lexicon'' (1712) explained terms that usefully described the trades and scientific and commercial education. ''Jablonksi Allgemeines Lexicon'' (1721) was better known than the ''Handlungs-Lexicon'' and underscored technical subjects rather than scientific theory. For example, over five columns of text were dedicated to wine while geometry and [[logic]] were allocated only twenty-two and seventeen lines, respectively. The first edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' (1771) was modelled along the same lines as the German lexicons.&lt;ref&gt;Headrick, (2000), pp.&amp;nbsp;150–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the prime example of reference works that systematized scientific knowledge in the age of Enlightenment were [[universal encyclopedia]]s rather than technical dictionaries. It was the goal of universal encyclopedias to record all human knowledge in a comprehensive reference work.&lt;ref&gt;Headrick, (2000), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; The most well-known of these works is [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]]'s ''[[Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers]]''. The work, which began publication in 1751, was composed of thirty-five volumes and over 71 000 separate entries. A great number of the entries were dedicated to describing the sciences and crafts in detail and provided intellectuals across Europe with a high-quality survey of human knowledge. In d'Alembert's ''Preliminary Discourse to the Encyclopedia of Diderot'', the work's goal to record the extent of human knowledge in the arts and sciences is outlined:

{{quote|As an Encyclopédie, it is to set forth as well as possible the order and connection of the parts of human knowledge. As a Reasoned Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and Trades, it is to contain the general principles that form the basis of each science and each art, liberal or mechanical, and the most essential facts that make up the body and substance of each.&lt;ref&gt;d'Alembert, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The massive work was arranged according to a "tree of knowledge". The tree reflected the marked division between the arts and sciences, which was largely a result of the rise of empiricism. Both areas of knowledge were united by philosophy, or the trunk of the tree of knowledge. The Enlightenment's desacrilization of religion was pronounced in the tree's design, particularly where theology accounted for a peripheral branch, with black magic as a close neighbour.&lt;ref&gt;Darnton, (1979), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; As the ''Encyclopédie'' gained popularity, it was published in [[book binding|quarto]] and [[book binding|octavo]] editions after 1777. The quarto and octavo editions were much less expensive than previous editions, making the ''Encyclopédie'' more accessible to the non-elite. Robert Darnton estimates that there were approximately 25 000 copies of the ''Encyclopédie'' in circulation throughout France and Europe before the French Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Darnton, (1979), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The extensive, yet affordable encyclopedia came to represent the transmission of Enlightenment and scientific education to an expanding audience.&lt;ref&gt;Darnton, (1979), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popularization of science===
One of the most important developments that the Enlightenment era brought to the discipline of science was its popularization. An increasingly literate population seeking knowledge and education in both the arts and the sciences drove the expansion of print culture and the dissemination of scientific learning. The new literate population was due to a high rise in the availability of food. This enabled many people to rise out of poverty, and instead of paying more for food, they had money for education.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, (1988), p. 191; Melton, (2001), pp.&amp;nbsp;82–83&lt;/ref&gt; Popularization was generally part of an overarching Enlightenment ideal that endeavoured "to make information available to the greatest number of people".&lt;ref&gt;Headrick, (2000), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; As public interest in natural philosophy grew during the 18th century, public lecture courses and the publication of popular texts opened up new roads to money and fame for amateurs and scientists who remained on the periphery of universities and academies.&lt;ref&gt;Headrick, (2000), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; More formal works included explanations of scientific theories for individuals lacking the educational background to comprehend the original scientific text. [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton's]] celebrated ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' was published in Latin and remained inaccessible to readers without education in the classics until Enlightenment writers began to translate and analyze the text in the vernacular.

[[File:Fontenelle.jpg|thumb|left|A portrait of [[Bernard de Fontenelle]]]]
The first significant work that expressed scientific theory and knowledge expressly for the laity, in the vernacular and with the entertainment of readers in mind, was [[Bernard de Fontenelle]]'s ''[[Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds]]'' (1686). The book was produced specifically for women with an interest in scientific writing and inspired a variety of similar works.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, (1991), pp. 85, 90&lt;/ref&gt; These popular works were written in a discursive style, which was laid out much more clearly for the reader than the complicated articles, treatises and books published by the academies and scientists. [[Charles Leadbetter|Charles Leadbetter's]] ''Astronomy'' (1727) was advertised as "a Work entirely New" that would include "short and easie {{sic}} Rules and Astronomical Tables".&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, (1991), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The first French introduction to Newtonianism and the ''Principia'' was ''Eléments de la philosophie de Newton'', published by Voltaire in 1738.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, (2003), p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émilie du Châtelet]]'s translation of the ''Principia'', published after her death in 1756, also helped to spread Newton's theories beyond scientific academies and the university.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, (2003), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for a growing female audience, [[Francesco Algarotti]] published ''Il Newtonianism per le dame'', which was a tremendously popular work and was translated from Italian into English by [[Elizabeth Carter]]. A similar introduction to Newtonianism for women was produced by [[Henry Pemberton]]. His ''A View of Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophy'' was published by subscription. Extant records of subscribers show that women from a wide range of social standings purchased the book, indicating the growing number of scientifically inclined female readers among the middling class.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, (1991), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Enlightenment, women also began producing popular scientific works themselves. [[Sarah Trimmer]] wrote a successful natural history textbook for children titled ''The Easy Introduction to the Knowledge of Nature'' (1782), which was published for many years after in eleven editions.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, (1991), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schools and universities===
{{main|Education in the Age of Enlightenment}}
Most work on the Enlightenment emphasizes the ideals discussed by intellectuals, rather than the actual state of education at the time. Leading educational theorists like England's John Locke and Switzerland's Jean Jacques Rousseau both emphasized the importance of shaping young minds early. By the late Enlightenment, there was a rising demand for a more universal approach to education, particularly after the American and French Revolutions.

The predominant educational psychology from the 1750s onward, especially in northern European countries was associationism, the notion that the mind associates or dissociates ideas through repeated routines. In addition to being conducive to Enlightenment ideologies of liberty, self-determination and personal responsibility, it offered a practical theory of the mind that allowed teachers to transform longstanding forms of print and manuscript culture into effective graphic tools of learning for the lower and middle orders of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=The Shape of Knowledge: Children and the Visual Culture of Literacy and Numeracy|journal=Science in Context|year=2013|volume=26|issue=2|pages=215–245|url=https://www.academia.edu/1817033/The_Shape_of_Knowledge_Children_and_the_Visual_Culture_of_Literacy_and_Numeracy_Science_in_Context_26_2013_215-245|doi=10.1017/s0269889713000045}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children were taught to memorize facts through oral and graphic methods that originated during the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hotson|first=Howard|title=Commonplace Learning: Ramism and Its German Ramifications 1543–1630|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the leading universities associated with Enlightenment progressive principles were located in northern Europe, with the most renowned being the universities of Leiden, Göttingen, Halle, Montpellier, Uppsala and Edinburgh. These universities, especially Edinburgh, produced professors whose ideas had a significant impact on Britain's North American colonies and later the American Republic. Within the natural sciences, Edinburgh's medical school also led the way in chemistry, anatomy and pharmacology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=The Language of Mineralogy: John Walker, Chemistry and the Edinburgh Medical School, 1750–1800|year=2008|publisher=Ashgate|location=Aldershot|url=https://www.academia.edu/1112014/The_Language_of_Mineralogy_John_Walker_Chemistry_and_the_Edinburgh_Medical_School_1750-1800_2008_}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other parts of Europe, the universities and schools of France and most of Europe were bastions of traditionalism and were not hospitable to the Enlightenment. In France, the major exception was the medical university at Montpellier.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Williams, ''A Cultural History of Medical Vitalism in Enlightenment Montpellier'' (2003) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of Academies in France during the Enlightenment begins with the [[French Academy of Sciences|Academy of Science]], founded in 1635 in Paris. It was closely tied to the French state, acting as an extension of a government seriously lacking in scientists. It helped promote and organize new disciplines and it trained new scientists. It also contributed to the enhancement of scientists' social status, considering them to be the "most useful of all citizens". Academies demonstrate the [[Scientific revolution|rising interest in science]] along with its increasing secularization, as evidenced by the small number of clerics who were members (13 percent).&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Roche'', France in the Enlightenment'', (1998), 420.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of the French academies in the public sphere cannot be attributed to their membership, as although the majority of their members were bourgeois, the exclusive institution was only open to elite Parisian scholars. They perceived themselves as "interpreters of the sciences for the people". For example, it was with this in mind that academicians took it upon themselves to disprove the popular pseudo-science of [[mesmerism]].&lt;ref&gt;Roche, 515, 516.&lt;/ref&gt;

The strongest contribution of the French Academies to the public sphere comes from the ''concours académiques'' (roughly translated as "academic contests") they sponsored throughout France. These academic contests were perhaps the most public of any institution during the Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Caradonna JL. ''Annales'', "Prendre part au siècle des Lumières: Le concours académique et la culture intellectuelle au XVIIIe siècle"&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of contests dated back to the Middle Ages and was revived in the mid-17th century. The subject matter had previously been generally religious and/or monarchical, featuring essays, poetry and painting. However, by roughly 1725 this subject matter had radically expanded and diversified, including "royal propaganda, philosophical battles, and critical ruminations on the social and political institutions of the Old Regime". Topics of public controversy were also discussed such as the theories of Newton and Descartes, the slave trade, women's education and justice in France.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy L. Caradonna, "Prendre part au siècle des Lumières: Le concours académique et la culture intellectuelle au XVIIIe siècle", ''Annales. Histoire, Sciences sociales'', vol.64 (mai-juin 2009), n.3, 633–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

More importantly, the contests were open to all and the enforced anonymity of each submission guaranteed that neither gender nor social rank would determine the judging. Indeed, although the "vast majority" of participants belonged to the wealthier strata of society ("the liberal arts, the clergy, the judiciary and the medical profession"), there were some cases of the popular classes submitting essays and even winning.&lt;ref&gt;Caradonna, 634–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a significant number of women participated—and won—the competitions. Of a total of 2,300 prize competitions offered in France, women won 49—perhaps a small number by modern standards, but very significant in an age in which most women did not have any academic training. Indeed, the majority of the winning entries were for poetry competitions, a genre commonly stressed in women's education.&lt;ref&gt;Caradonna, 653–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, the [[Royal Society of London]] also played a significant role in the public sphere and the spread of Enlightenment ideas. It was founded by a group of independent scientists and given a royal charter in 1662.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://royalsociety.org/about-us/history/royal-charters/|title=Royal Charters|work=royalsociety.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society played a large role in spreading [[Robert Boyle]]'s [[experimental philosophy]] around Europe and acted as a clearinghouse for intellectual correspondence and exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Shapin, ''A Social History of Truth: Civility and Science in Seventeenth-Century England'', Chicago; London: University of Chicago Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle was "a founder of the experimental world in which scientists now live and operate" and his method based knowledge on experimentation, which had to be witnessed to provide proper empirical legitimacy. This is where the Royal Society came into play: witnessing had to be a "collective act" and the Royal Society's assembly rooms were ideal locations for relatively public demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Shapin and Simon Schaffer, ''Leviathan and the Air-Pump: Hobbes, Boyle, and the Experimental Life'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1985), 5, 56, 57. This same desire for multiple witnesses led to attempts at replication in other locations and a complex iconography and literary technology developed to provide visual and written proof of experimentation. See pp. 59–65.&lt;/ref&gt; However, not just any witness was considered to be credible: "Oxford professors were accounted more reliable witnesses than Oxfordshire peasants". Two factors were taken into account: a witness's knowledge in the area and a witness's "moral constitution". In other words, only civil society were considered for Boyle's public.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin and Schaffer, 58, 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Salons===
{{Main|Historiography of the salon}}
It was the place in which philosophes got reunited and talked about old, actual or new ideas. Salons were the place where intellectual and enlightened ideas were built.

===Coffeehouses===
{{Main|coffeehouse|English coffeehouses in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries|l2=English coffeehouses in the 17th and 18th centuries}}
Coffeehouses were especially important to the spread of knowledge during the Enlightenment because they created a unique environment in which people from many different walks of life gathered and shared ideas. They were frequently criticized by nobles who feared the possibility of an environment in which class and its accompanying titles and privileges were disregarded. Such an environment was especially intimidating to monarchs who derived much of their power from the disparity between classes of people. If classes were to join together under the influence of Enlightenment thinking, they might recognize the all-encompassing oppression and abuses of their monarchs and because of their size might be able to carry out successful revolts. Monarchs also resented the idea of their subjects convening as one to discuss political matters, especially those concerning foreign affairs—rulers thought political affairs to be their business only, a result of their supposed divine right to rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Coffeehouse Civility, 1660-1714: An Aspect of Post-Courtly Culture in England|first=Lawrence E.|journal = Huntington Library Quarterly|last=Klein|date=1 January 1996|publisher=|volume=59|issue=1|pages=31–51|doi=10.2307/3817904|jstor = 3817904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coffeehouses represent a turning point in history during which people discovered that they could have enjoyable social lives within their communities. Coffeeshops became homes away from home for many who sought, for the first time, to engage in discourse with their neighbors and discuss intriguing and thought-provoking matters, especially those regarding philosophy to politics. Coffeehouses were essential to the Enlightenment, for they were centers of free-thinking and self-discovery. Although many coffeehouse patrons were scholars, a great deal were not. Coffeehouses attracted a diverse set of people, including not only the educated wealthy but also members of the bourgeoisie and the lower class. While it may seem positive that patrons, being doctors, lawyers, merchants, etc. represented almost all classes, the coffeeshop environment sparked fear in those who sought to preserve class distinction. One of the most popular critiques of the coffeehouse claimed that it "allowed promiscuous association among people from different rungs of the social ladder, from the artisan to the aristocrat" and was therefore compared to Noah's Ark, receiving all types of animals, clean or unclean.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; This unique culture served as a catalyst for journalism when [[Joseph Addison]] and [[Richard Steele]] recognized its potential as an audience. Together, Steele and Addison published ''[[The Spectator (1711)]]'', a daily publication which aimed, through fictional narrator Mr. Spectator, both to entertain and to provoke discussion regarding serious philosophical matters.

The first English coffeehouse opened in Oxford in 1650. Brian Cowan said that Oxford coffeehouses developed into "[[penny universities]]", offering a locus of learning that was less formal than structured institutions. These penny universities occupied a significant position in Oxford academic life, as they were frequented by those consequently referred to as the ''virtuosi'', who conducted their research on some of the resulting premises. According to Cowan, "the coffeehouse was a place for like-minded scholars to congregate, to read, as well as learn from and to debate with each other, but was emphatically not a university institution, and the discourse there was of a far different order than any university tutorial".&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, 90, 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Café Procope]] was established in Paris in 1686 and by the 1720s there were around 400 cafés in the city. The Café Procope in particular became a center of Enlightenment, welcoming such celebrities as Voltaire and Rousseau. The Café Procope was where Diderot and D'Alembert decided to create the ''Encyclopédie''.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Jones, ''Paris: Biography of a City'' (New York: Viking, 2004), 188, 189.&lt;/ref&gt; The cafés were one of the various "nerve centers" for ''bruits publics'', public noise or rumour. These ''bruits'' were allegedly a much better source of information than were the actual newspapers available at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert |last=Darnton |title=An Early Information Society: News and the Media in Eighteenth-Century Paris |publisher=American Historical Review |year=2000 |volume= 105#1 |pages=1–35 |jstor=2652433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debating societies===
{{Main|London Debating Societies}}
The debating societies are an example of the public sphere during the Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Donna T. Andrew, "Popular Culture and Public Debate: London 1780", ''This Historical Journal'', Vol. 39, No. 2. (June 1996), pp. 405–423.&lt;/ref&gt; Their origins include:
* Clubs of fifty or more men who, at the beginning of the 18th century, met in pubs to discuss religious issues and affairs of state.
* Mooting clubs, set up by law students to practice rhetoric.
* Spouting clubs, established to help actors train for theatrical roles.
* [[John Henley (clergyman)|John Henley]]'s Oratory, which mixed outrageous sermons with even more absurd questions, like "Whether Scotland be anywhere in the world?".&lt;ref&gt;Andrew, 406. Andrew gives the name as "William Henley", which must be a lapse of writing.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Salon de Madame Geoffrin.jpg|thumb|An example of a French salon]]
In the late 1770s, popular debating societies began to move into more "genteel" rooms, a change which helped establish a new standard of sociability.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew, 408.&lt;/ref&gt; The backdrop to these developments was "an explosion of interest in the theory and practice of public elocution". The debating societies were commercial enterprises that responded to this demand, sometimes very successfully. Some societies welcomed from 800 to 1,200 spectators a night.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew, 406–08, 411.&lt;/ref&gt;

The debating societies discussed an extremely wide range of topics. Before the Enlightenment, most intellectual debates revolved around "confessional"&amp;nbsp;– that is, Catholic, Lutheran, Reformed (Calvinist) or Anglican issues and the main aim of these debates was to establish which bloc of faith ought to have the "monopoly of truth and a God-given title to authority".{{sfn|Israel|2001|p=4}} After this date, everything thus previously rooted in tradition was questioned and often replaced by new concepts in the light of philosophical reason. After the second half of the 17th century and during the 18th century, a "general process of rationalization and secularization set in" and confessional disputes were reduced to a secondary status in favor of the "escalating contest between faith and incredulity".{{sfn|Israel|2001|p=4}}

In addition to debates on religion, societies discussed issues such as politics and the role of women. However, it is important to note that the critical subject matter of these debates did not necessarily translate into opposition to the government. In other words, the results of the debate quite frequently upheld the ''status quo''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew, 412–15.&lt;/ref&gt; From a historical standpoint, one of the most important features of the debating society was their openness to the public, as women attended and even participated in almost every debating society, which were likewise open to all classes providing they could pay the entrance fee. Once inside, spectators were able to participate in a largely egalitarian form of sociability that helped spread Enlightenment ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew, 422.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Masonic lodges===
[[File:Freimaurer Initiation.jpg|thumb|Masonic initiation ceremony]]

Historians have long debated the extent to which the secret network of [[Freemasonry]] was a main factor in the Enlightenment. The leaders of the Enlightenment included Freemasons such as Diderot, Montesquieu, Voltaire, Lessing, Pope,&lt;ref&gt;Maynard Mack, Alexander Pope: A Life, Yale University Press, 1985 pages 437-440. Pope, a Catholic, was a Freemason in 1730, eight years before membership was prohibited by the Catholic Church (1738). Pope's name is on the membership list of the Goat Tavern Lodge (p. 439). Pope's name appears on a 1723 list and a 1730 list.&lt;/ref&gt; Horace Walpole, Sir Robert Walpole, Mozart, Goethe, Frederick the Great, Benjamin Franklin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J. A. Leo Lemay|title=The Life of Benjamin Franklin, Volume 2: Printer and Publisher, 1730–1747|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KOhKqgMD10cC&amp;pg=PA83|year=2013|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|pages=83–92|isbn=9780812209297}}&lt;/ref&gt; and George Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bullock | first1 = Steven C. | year = 1996 | title = Initiating the Enlightenment?: Recent Scholarship on European Freemasonry | url = | journal = Eighteenth-Century Life | volume = 20 | issue = 1| page = 81 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Norman Davies said that Freemasonry was a powerful force on behalf of [[liberalism]] in Europe from about 1700 to the twentieth century. It expanded rapidly during the Age of Enlightenment, reaching practically every country in Europe. It was especially attractive to powerful aristocrats and politicians as well as intellectuals, artists and political activists.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Davies, ''Europe: A History'' (1996) pp. 634–35&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Age of Enlightenment, Freemasons comprised an international network of like-minded men, often meeting in secret in ritualistic programs at their lodges. They promoted the ideals of the Enlightenment and helped diffuse these values across Britain and France and other places. Freemasonry as a systematic creed with its own myths, values and set of rituals originated in Scotland around 1600 and spread first to England and then across the Continent in the eighteenth century. They fostered new codes of conduct—including a communal understanding of liberty and equality inherited from guild sociability—"liberty, fraternity and equality".&lt;ref&gt;Margaret C. Jacob's seminal work on Enlightenment freemasonry, Margaret C. Jacob, ''Living the Enlightenment: Free masonry and Politics in Eighteenth-Century Europe'' (Oxford University Press, 1991) p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish soldiers and Jacobite Scots brought to the Continent ideals of fraternity which reflected not the local system of Scottish customs but the institutions and ideals originating in the English Revolution against royal absolutism.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret C. Jacob, "Polite worlds of Enlightenment," in Martin Fitzpatrick and Peter Jones, eds. ''The Enlightenment World'' (Routledge, 2004) pp. 272–87.&lt;/ref&gt; Freemasonry was particularly prevalent in France—by 1789, there were perhaps as many as 100,000 French Masons, making Freemasonry the most popular of all Enlightenment associations.&lt;ref&gt;Roche, 436.&lt;/ref&gt; The Freemasons displayed a passion for secrecy and created new degrees and ceremonies. Similar societies, partially imitating Freemasonry, emerged in France, Germany, Sweden and Russia. One example was the [[Illuminati]] founded in Bavaria in 1776, which was copied after the Freemasons, but was never part of the movement. The Illuminati was an overtly political group, which most Masonic lodges decidedly were not.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick and Jones, eds. ''The Enlightenment World'' p. 281&lt;/ref&gt;

Masonic lodges created a private model for public affairs. They "reconstituted the polity and established a constitutional form of self-government, complete with constitutions and laws, elections and representatives". In other words, the micro-society set up within the lodges constituted a normative model for society as a whole. This was especially true on the continent: when the first lodges began to appear in the 1730s, their embodiment of British values was often seen as threatening by state authorities. For example, the Parisian lodge that met in the mid 1720s was composed of English [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] exiles.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, pp. 20, 73, 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, freemasons all across Europe explicitly linked themselves to the Enlightenment as a whole. For example, in French lodges the line "As the means to be enlightened I search for the enlightened" was a part of their initiation rites. British lodges assigned themselves the duty to "initiate the unenlightened". This did not necessarily link lodges to the irreligious, but neither did this exclude them from the occasional heresy. In fact, many lodges praised the Grand Architect, the masonic terminology for the deistic divine being who created a scientifically ordered universe.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, 145–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

German historian Reinhart Koselleck claimed: "On the Continent there were two social structures that left a decisive imprint on the Age of Enlightenment: the Republic of Letters and the Masonic lodges".&lt;ref&gt;Reinhart Koselleck, ''Critique and Crisis'', p. 62, (The MIT Press, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish professor Thomas Munck argues that "although the Masons did promote international and cross-social contacts which were essentially non-religious and broadly in agreement with enlightened values, they can hardly be described as a major radical or reformist network in their own right".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Munck, 1994, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Masons values seemed to greatly appeal to Enlightenment values and thinkers. Diderot discusses the link between Freemason ideals and the enlightenment in D'Alembert's Dream, exploring masonry as a way of spreading enlightenment beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.stmarys-ca.edu/sites/default/files/attachments/files/Dalemberts_Dream.pdf |author=Denis Diderot |title=D'Alembert's Dream |year=1769}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Margaret Jacob stresses the importance of the Masons in indirectly inspiring enlightened political thought.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret C. Jacob, ''Living the Enlightenment: Freemasonry and politics in eighteenth-century Europe'' (Oxford University Press, 1991.)&lt;/ref&gt; On the negative side, Daniel Roche contests claims that Masonry promoted egalitarianism and he argues that the lodges only attracted men of similar social backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Roche, 437.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of noble women in the French "lodges of adoption" that formed in the 1780s was largely due to the close ties shared between these lodges and aristocratic society.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, 139. See also Janet M. Burke, "Freemasonry, Friendship and Noblewomen: The Role of the Secret Society in Bringing Enlightenment Thought to Pre-Revolutionary Women Elites", ''History of European Ideas'' 10 no. 3 (1989): 283–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

The major opponent of Freemasonry was the Roman Catholic Church so that in countries with a large Catholic element, such as France, Italy, Spain and Mexico, much of the ferocity of the political battles involve the confrontation between what Davies calls the reactionary Church and enlightened Freemasonry.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, ''Europe: A History'' (1996) pp. 634–35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Weisberger et al., eds., ''Freemasonry on both sides of the Atlantic: essays concerning the craft in the British Isles, Europe, the United States, and Mexico'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Even in France, Masons did not act as a group.&lt;ref&gt;Robert R. Palmer, ''The Age of the Democratic Revolution: The struggle'' (1970) p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; American historians, while noting that Benjamin Franklin and [[George Washington]] were indeed active Masons, have downplayed the importance of Freemasonry in causing the American Revolution because the Masonic order was non-political and included both Patriots and their enemy the Loyalists.&lt;ref&gt;Neil L. York, "Freemasons and the American Revolution", ''The Historian'' Volume: 55. Issue: 2. 1993, pp. 315+.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Art ===
The art produced during the Enlightenment was about a search for morality that was absent from previous art. At the same time, the Classical art of Greece and Rome became interesting to people again, since archaeological teams discovered Pompeii and Herculaneum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Janson|first1=H. W.|last2=Janson|first2=Anthony|title=A Basic History of Art|date=2003|publisher=Harry n. Abrams, Inc.|location=New York|pages=458–474}}&lt;/ref&gt; People took inspiration from it and revived the classical art into neo-classical art. This can be especially seen in early American art, where, throughout their art and architecture, they used arches, goddesses, and other classical architectural designs.

'''Anna Willess Williams''' (1857 – April 17, 1926) was a teacher and philosophical writer best known as the model for [[George T. Morgan|George T. Morgan's]] silver dollar design, popularly known as the [[Morgan dollar]].

[[File:1899 obverse.jpg|thumb|left|150px|1899 Morgan dollar]]

In 1876, George T. Morgan began creating a series of new coin designs at the behest of Director of the Mint, [[Henry Linderman|Dr. Henry R. Linderman]].&lt;ref name="vam"&gt;Van Allen &amp; Mallis, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan opted to use the profile of an American girl to depict [[Liberty (goddess)|Liberty]] instead of simply creating an imaginary figure for the [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] of his new design.&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; After he rejected several possible candidates, Morgan's friend, artist [[Thomas Eakins]], recommended Anna Williams of [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; Eakins knew Williams through her father, Henry Williams, and she had posed for several of Eakins's paintings.&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; 

Williams reluctantly sat for five modelling sessions with Morgan in November 1876 after being convinced to do so by friends.&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; Morgan was impressed with her profile, stating that it was the most perfect he had seen in England or America.&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; The [[Dollar coin (United States)|silver dollar]] bearing her likeness was first struck on March 11, 1878.&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; A condition of her sitting for Morgan was that her identity be kept secret, but the subject of the portrait was revealed to be Williams shortly after the dollar was released.&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; Williams was troubled by her newly acquired fame, receiving thousands of letters and visits at both her home and workplace.&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; Williams preferred not to talk about her modelling work with Morgan, dismissing it as an "incident of my youth."&lt;ref name="time"/&gt;

'''Aristotle's views on women''' influenced later [[Western philosophy|Western thinkers]], as well as [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic thinkers]], who quoted him as an authority until the end of the [[Middle Ages]], influencing [[women's history]].

In his [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']], [[Aristotle]] saw women as subject to men, but as higher than slaves, and lacking authority; he believed the husband should exert political rule over the wife. Among women's differences from men were that they were, in his view, more impulsive, more compassionate, more complaining, and more deceptive. He gave the same weight to women's happiness as to men's, and in his ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'' stated that society could not be happy unless women were happy too. Whereas [[Plato]] stated that women, while inferior, should be educated, Aristotle appears to have disagreed.

In his [[Aristotle's biology#Inheritance|theory of inheritance]], Aristotle considered the mother to provide a passive material element to the child, while the father provided an active, ensouling element with the form of the human species.

==Differences between males and females==

Aristotle believed women were inferior to men. For example, in his work [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']] (1254b13–14), Aristotle states "as regards the sexes, the male is by nature superior and the female inferior, the male ruler and the female subject".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Plato and Aristotle on the Nature of Women|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236725862|journal = Journal of the History of Philosophy|pages = 467–478|volume = 21|issue = 4|doi = 10.1353/hph.1983.0090|first = Nicholas D.|last = Smith|year = 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Politics'' 1.12 he wrote, "The slave is wholly lacking the [[Deliberation|deliberative]] element; the female has it but it lacks authority; the child has it but it is incomplete".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-pol/#SH7e |title=Aristotle: Politics [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy&amp;#93; 1260a11 |publisher=Iep.utm.edu |date=2005-07-27 |accessdate=2013-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cynthia Freeland wrote: "Aristotle says that the courage of a man lies in commanding, a woman's lies in obeying; that 'matter yearns for form, as the female for the male and the ugly for the beautiful'; that women have fewer teeth than men; that a female is an incomplete male or 'as it were, a deformity'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|edition = Spring 2016|title = Feminist History of Philosophy|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/feminism-femhist/|date = 2016-01-01|first = Charlotte|last = Witt|first2 = Lisa|last2 = Shapiro|editor-first = Edward N.|editor-last = Zalta}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle believed that men and women naturally differed both physically and mentally. He claimed that women are "more mischievous, less simple, more impulsive ... more compassionate ... more easily moved to tears ... more jealous, more querulous, more apt to scold and to strike ... more prone to despondency and less hopeful ... more void of shame or self-respect, more false of speech, more deceptive, of more retentive memory [and] ... also more wakeful; more shrinking [and] more difficult to rouse to action" than men.&lt;ref&gt;''[[History of Animals]]'', 608b1–14.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He wrote that only fair-skinned women, not darker-skinned women, had a sexual discharge and climaxed. He also believed this discharge could be increased by eating of pungent foods. Aristotle thought a woman's sexual discharge was akin to that of an infertile or amputated male's.&lt;ref name=728a&gt;''[[Generation of Animals]]'', I, 728a.&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that both sexes contributed to the material of generation, but that the female's contribution was in her discharge (as in a male's) rather than within the ovary.&lt;ref name=728a/&gt;

Aristotle explains how and why the association between man and woman takes on a hierarchical character by commenting on male rule over 'barbarians', or non-Greeks. "By nature the female has been distinguished from the slave. For nature makes nothing in the manner that the coppersmiths make the Delphic knife – that is, frugally – but, rather, it makes each thing for one purpose. For each thing would do its work most nobly if it had one task rather than many. Among the barbarians the female and the slave have the same status. This is because there are no natural rulers among them but, rather, the association among them is between male and female slave. On account of this, the poets say that 'it is fitting that Greeks rule barbarians', as the barbarian and the slave are by nature the same."&lt;ref name=Stauffer/&gt; While Aristotle reduced women's roles in society, and promoted the idea that women should receive less food and nourishment than males, he also criticised the results: a woman, he thought, was then more [[compassionate]], more opinionated, more apt to scold and to strike. He stated that women are more prone to despondency, more void of shame or self-respect, more false of speech, more deceptive, and of having a better memory.&lt;ref&gt;''History of Animals'', book IX, part 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's role in inheritance==
{{further|Aristotle's biology|Telegony (pregnancy)}}
[[File:Aristotle's model of Inheritance.png|thumb|300px|Inheritance: model of transmission of movements from parents to child, and of [[Hylomorphism|form]] from the father. The model is not fully symmetric.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=215–221}}]]

Aristotle's inheritance model sought to explain how the parents' characteristics are transmitted to the child, subject to influence from the environment.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=215–221}} In his view, an active, ensouling masculine element brought life to a passive female element.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newfoundations.com/WOMAN/Aristotle.html Aristotle on woman]&lt;/ref&gt; The system worked as follows. The father's semen and the mother's menses encode their parental characteristics.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=215–221}}{{sfn|Taylor|1922|page=50}} The model is partly asymmetric, as only the father's movements define [[Aristotle#Aristotle's epistemology|the form or ''eidos'']] of the human species, while the movements of both the father's and the mother's fluids define features other than the form, such as the father's eye colour or the mother's nose shape.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=215–221}} The theory has some symmetry, as semen movements carry maleness while the menses carry femaleness. If the semen is hot enough to overpower the cold menses, the child will be a boy; but if it is too cold to do this, the child will be a girl. Inheritance is thus [[particulate inheritance|particulate]] (definitely one trait or another), as in [[Mendelian genetics]], unlike the [[Hippocratic]] model which was continuous and [[blending inheritance|blending]].{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=215–221}} The child's sex can be influenced by factors that affect temperature, including the weather, the wind direction, diet, and the father's age. Features other than sex also depend on whether the semen overpowers the menses, so if a man has strong semen, he will have sons who resemble him, while if the semen is weak, he will have daughters who resemble their mother.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=215–221}}

==Morality and politics==
According to Aristotle, there should be "political rule" of the husband over the wife.&lt;ref&gt;''Politics'' I, 1259a–b.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zamfir&gt;Korinna Zamfir, ''Men and Women in the Household of God: A Contextual Approach to Roles and Ministries in the Pastoral Epistle'', Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 2013, p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As for the differences between husband and wife, Aristotle says that these "always" consisted in external appearances, in speeches, and in honors.&lt;ref&gt;''Politics'', 1259b.&lt;/ref&gt; The household functions of a man and of a woman are different because his business is "to get" and hers "to keep".&lt;ref&gt;''Politics'' 1277b.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===On good wives===
[[Image:Aristotelous Oikonomikos.png|thumb|upright|Book cover of an edition of [[Economics (Aristotle)|''Economics'']] from 1830.]]
In his [[Economics (Aristotle)|''Economics'']], Aristotle wrote that it befits not a man of sound mind to bestow his person promiscuously, or have random intercourse with women; for otherwise the base-born will share in the rights of his lawful children, and his wife will be robbed of her honor due, and shame be attached to his sons. It is fitting that he should approach his wife in honor, full of self-restraint and awe, and in his conversation with her, should use only the words of a right-minded man, suggesting only such acts as are themselves lawful and honorable. Aristotle's thought that a wife was best honored when she saw that her husband was faithful to her, and that he had no preference for another woman, but before all others loves, trusts her and holds her as his own.&lt;ref&gt;''The Politics and Economics of Aristotle'', Edward English Walford and John Gillies, trans. (London: G. Bell &amp; Sons, 1908), pp. 298ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle wrote that a husband should secure the agreement, loyalty, and devotion of his wife, so that whether he himself is present or not, there may be no difference in her attitude towards him, since she realizes that they are alike guardians of the common interests, and so when he is away she may feel that to her no man is kinder or more virtuous or more truly hers than her own husband.

===Spartan women===
{{Main article|Women in ancient Sparta}}
Aristotle wrote that in [[Sparta]], the legislator wanted to make the whole city (or country) hardy and temperate, and that he carried out his intention in the case of the men, but he overlooked the women, who lived in every sort of intemperance and wealth. He added that in those regimes in which the condition of the women was bad, half the city could be regarded as having no laws.&lt;ref&gt;''The Politics of Aristotle'', Book 2, Ch. 9, trans. Benjamin Jowett, London: Colonial Press, 1900.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equal weight to female and male happiness===

Aristotle gave equal weight to women's happiness as he did to men's, and commented in his ''Rhetoric'' that a society cannot be happy unless women are happy too. In an article titled "Aristotle's Account of the Subjection of Women", Stauffer explains that Aristotle believed that in nature a common good came of the rule of a superior being. But he does not indicate a common good for men being superior to women. He uses the word κρείττων ''kreitton'' to indicate superiority, meaning stronger. Aristotle believed that rational reasoning is what made you superior over lesser beings in nature, yet still used the term meaning stronger, not more rational or intelligent.&lt;ref name=Stauffer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stauffer |first=Dana |title=Aristotle's Account of the Subjection of Women |journal=The Journal of Politics |date=Oct 2008 |volume=70 |issue=4 |pages=929–941 |jstor=30219476 |doi=10.1017/s0022381608080973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===

On children, he said, "And what could be more divine than this, or more desired by a man of sound mind, than to beget by a noble and honored wife children who shall be the most loyal supporters and discreet guardians of their parents in old age, and the preservers of the whole house? Rightly reared by father and mother, children will grow up virtuous, as those who have treated them piously and righteously deserve that they should..."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Aristotle's Politics: Writings from the Complete Works: Politics, Economics, Constitution of Athens'', Princeton University Press, 2016, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle believed we all have a biological drive to procreate, to leave behind something to take the place and be similar to ourselves. This then justifies the natural partnership between man and woman. And each person has one specific purpose because we are better at mastering one specific trait rather than being adequate at multiple. For Aristotle, women's purpose is to give birth to children. Aristotle stressed that man and woman work together to raise the children and that how they raise them has a huge influence over the kind of people they become and thus the kind of society or community that everyone lives in.

==Comparison with Plato's views on women&lt;!--'Plato's views on women' redirects here--&gt;==

Aristotle appears to disagree with [[Plato]] on the topic whether women ought to be educated, as Plato says that they must be. Both of them, however, consider women to be inferior. Plato in ''Timaeus'' (90e) claims that men who were cowards and were lazy throughout their life shall be reborn as women and in the ''Laws'' (781b), he offers his reasons why women should be educated: "Because you neglected this sex, you gradually lost control of a great many things which would be in a far better state today if they had been regulated by law. A woman's natural potential for virtue is inferior to a man's, so she's proportionately a greater danger, perhaps even twice as great." Plato further establishes his opinion on the inferiority of women's "natural potential" by claiming in ''Republic'' (455d) that "Women share by nature in every way of life just as men do, but in all of them women are weaker than men."

Plato firmly believed in reincarnation and this was very important for the distinction he made between the nature of men and women. This was not the case for Aristotle, who saw the differences as biological. Plato discusses this matter with more detail in ''Timaeus'', where he states that men have a superior soul than women (42a): "Humans have a twofold nature, the superior kind should be such as would from then on be called "man". He added, once again, that men who led bad lives shall be reborn as women (42b): "And if a person lived a good life throughout the due course of his time, he would at the end return to his dwelling place in his companion star, to live a life of happiness that agreed with his character. But if he failed in this, he would be born a second time, now as a woman."

Plato also appears to use the term "womanish" or "female-like" as an derogatory term implying inferiority and emotional instability, as this is clear from ''Republic'' 469d and 605e, amongst others.

==Legacy==
===Galen===
Aristotle's assumptions on female coldness influenced [[Galen]] and others for almost two thousand years until the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Tuana, Nancy|title=The Less Noble Sex: Scientific, Religious and Philosophical Conceptions of Women's Nature|year=1993|pages=21, 169|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-36098-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Church Fathers===
Joyce E. Salisbury argues that the [[Women in the patristic age|Church Fathers]], influenced by Aristotle's opinions, opposed the practice of independent female [[Asceticism|ascetism]] because it threatened to emancipate women from men.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce E. Salisbury, ''Church Fathers, Independent Virgins'', Verso, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Otto Weininger===
In his ''[[Sex and Character]]'', written in 1903, [[Otto Weininger]] explained that all people are composed of a mixture of the male and the female substance, and that these views are supported scientifically. Weininger cited Aristotle's views in the chapter "Male and Female Psychology" of his book.

'''Artificial philosophy''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] branch conceived by author Louis Molnar&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267156955_A_Step_Beyond_AI_Artificial_Philosophy "article: Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications", ResearchGate, (retrieved November 25, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; to consider what a being bestowed with [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) might consider about its own [[existence]] once it reaches a higher state of [[consciousness]]. The author reasons in his dissertation that at some point, either through [[Computer_programming|programming]] or organic [[self-development]], [[robot]]s will not see themselves as extensions of those that created them, and that their saying "Who am I?" will not lead them to think of themselves as one with [[human]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7822">'''Assemblage''' (from {{lang-fr|agencement}}, "a collection of things which have been gathered together or assembled") is an ontological framework developed by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], originally presented in their book ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' (1980). Assemblage theory provides a bottom-up framework for analyzing social complexity by emphasizing fluidity, exchangeability, and multiple functionalities through entities and their connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, vol. 39 (5), pp. 655-666; https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UT2016&gt;Wikis.la.utexas.edu,. (2016). Assemblage Theory | University of Texas Theory. Retrieved 1 March 2016, from {{cite web|url=http://wikis.la.utexas.edu/theory/page/assemblage-theory |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314011817/http://wikis.la.utexas.edu/theory/page/assemblage-theory |archivedate=2016-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assemblage theory asserts that, within a body, the relationships of component parts are not stable and fixed; rather, they can be displaced and replaced within and among other bodies, thus approaching systems through relations of exteriority.&lt;ref name=UT2016 /&gt;

==Overview==
The term assemblage, in a philosophical sense, originally stems from the French word ''agencement'', whose meaning translates narrowly to English as "arrangement", "fitting, or "fixing".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=J.|title=Agencement/Assemblage|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026327640602300219|journal=Theory, Culture &amp; Society|volume=23|issue=2-3|pages=108–109|doi=10.1177/026327640602300219}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Agencement'' asserts the inherent implication of the connection between specific concepts and that the arrangement of those concepts is what provides sense or meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, I., 2015. Assemblage theory and its discontents. Deleuze Studies, 9(3), pp.382-392.&lt;/ref&gt; Assemblage, on the other hand, can be more accurately described as the integration and connection of these concepts and that it is both the connections ''and'' the arrangements of those connections that provide context for assigned meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, I., 2015. Assemblage theory and its discontents. Deleuze Studies, 9(3), pp.382-392.&lt;/ref&gt; 

John Phillips argued in 2006 that Deleuze and Guattari rarely used the term assemblage at all in a philosophical sense, and that through narrow, literal English translations, the terms became misleadingly perceived as analogous. The translation of ''agencement'' as assemblage that "give[s] rise to the connotations based on analogical impressions, which liberate elements of a vocabulary from the arguments that once helped form it." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Deleuze and Guattari&lt;!--linked from 'Gilles Deleuze' and 'Template:Deleuze-Guattari'--&gt; ==
In ''[[A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]'', Deleuze and Guattari draw from [[dynamical systems theory]], which explores the way material systems self-organize, and extend the theory to include social, linguistic, and philosophical systems in order to create assemblage theory.&lt;ref name="Stanford2008"&gt;Smith, D., &amp; Protevi, J. (2008). Gilles Deleuze. plato.stanford.edu. Retrieved 1 March 2016, from http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/deleuze/#ThoPla&lt;/ref&gt; In assemblage theory, assemblages (or relationships) are formed through the processes of coding, stratification, and territorialization&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, vol. 39 (5), pp. 655-666; https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307  &lt;/ref&gt;. Any one philosophical context never operates in isolation. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Deleuze and Guattari use the term "constellation" when they talk about assemblage.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} A constellation, like any assemblage, is made up of imaginative contingent articulations among myriad heterogeneous elements.&lt;ref name="SlackandWise"&gt;Wise, J., &amp; Slack, J. (2014). Culture and Technology. New York, NY: Lang, Peter New York.&lt;/ref&gt; This process of ordering matter around a body is called coding.&lt;ref name="Stanford2008" /&gt; According to Deleuze and Guattari, assemblages are coded by taking a particular form; they select, compose, and complete a territory.&lt;ref name="SlackandWise" /&gt; In composing a territory, there exists the creation of hierarchical bodies in the process of stratification.&lt;ref name="Stanford2008" /&gt; Drawing from the constellation metaphor, Deleuze and Guattari argue that the constellation includes some heavenly bodies but leaves out others; the included bodies being those in close proximity given the particular gathering and angle of view.&lt;ref name="SlackandWise" /&gt; The example constellation thus defines the relationships with the bodies in and around it, and therefore demonstrates the social complexity of assemblage.

Territorialization is another process of assemblage theory, and is viewed as the ordering of the bodies that create the "assemblage".&lt;ref name="Stanford2008" /&gt; Assemblages territorialize both forms of content and forms of expression. Forms of content, also known as material forms, include the assemblage of human and nonhuman bodies, actions, and reactions. Forms of expression include incorporeal enunciations, acts, and statements.&lt;ref name="SlackandWise" /&gt; Within this ordering of the bodies, assemblages do not remain static; they are further characterized by processes of [[deterritorialization]] and reterritorialization. Deterritorialization occurs when articulations are disarticulated and disconnected through components "exiting" the assemblage; once again exemplfying the idea that these forms do not and can not operate alone&lt;ref name="SlackandWise" /&gt; Reterritorialization describes the process by which new components "enter" and new articulations are forged, thus constituting a new assemblage.&lt;ref name="SlackandWise" /&gt; In this way, these axes of content/expressive and the processes of territorialization exist to demonstrate the complex nature of  assemblages.

== DeLanda ==
[[Manuel DeLanda]] detailed the concept of assemblage in his book ''[[A New Philosophy of Society]]'' (2006) where, like Deleuze and Guattari, he suggests that social bodies on all scales are best analyzed through their individual components. Like Deleuze and Guattari, DeLanda’s approach examines relations of exteriority, in which assemblage components are self-subsistent and retain autonomy outside of the assemblage in which they exist &lt;ref name="Karaman2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Karaman | first1 = O | year = 2008 | title = A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory And Social Complexity by Manuel DeLanda | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8330.2008.00646.x | journal = Antipode | volume = 40 | issue = 5| pages = 935–937 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DeLanda details Deleuze and Guattari's (1987) assemblage theory of how assemblage components are organized through the two axes of material/expressive and territorializing/deterritorializing.&lt;ref name="Karaman2008" /&gt; DeLanda's additional contribution is to suggest that a third axis exists: of genetic/linguistic resources that also defines the interventions involved in the coding, decoding, and recoding of the assemblage.&lt;ref name="Karaman2008" /&gt; Like Deleuze and Guattari, DeLanda suggests that the social does not lose its reality, nor its materiality, through its complexity.&lt;ref name="UT2016" /&gt; In this way, assemblages are effective in their practicality; assemblages, though fluid, are nevertheless part of historically significant processes.

'''Buridan's Bridge''' (also known as '''[[Sophism]] 17''') is described by [[Jean Buridan]], one of the most famous and influential [[Philosophy|philosophers]] of the [[Late Middle Ages]], in his book ''Sophismata''. It is a [[self-referential]] [[paradox]] that involves a [[proposition]] pronounced about an event that might or might not happen in the future.

==The sophism==

The sophism is:
{{quotation|Imagine the following scenario:&lt;br&gt;
Socrates wants to cross a river and comes to a bridge guarded by Plato. The two speak as follows:&lt;br&gt;
''Plato:'' "Socrates, if in the first proposition which you utter, you speak the
truth, I will permit you to cross. But surely, if you speak falsely, I shall throw you into the water."&lt;br&gt;
''Socrates:'' "You will throw me into the water."&lt;ref name="Tense"/&gt;}}

[[Socrates]]' response puts [[Plato]] in a difficult situation. He could not throw Socrates into the water, because if he did he would violate his promise to let Socrates cross the bridge if he speaks the truth. On the other hand, if Plato allows Socrates to cross the bridge it would mean that Socrates spoke untruth when he replied: "You are going to throw me into the water." In that case Socrates should have been thrown into the water. In other words, Socrates could be allowed to cross the bridge if and only if he could not be.&lt;ref name="Buridan's Bridge"/&gt;

==Buridan's solution==

In order to solve the paradox Buridan proposes three questions:
#Is the proposition uttered by Socrates: "You are going to throw me into the water" true, or is it false?
#Is Plato's promise true or is it false?
#"What ought Plato to do to fulfill his promise?"&lt;ref name="Ulatowski"/&gt;

In response to the first question Buridan states that it is impossible to determine if Socrates' proposition is true or false. This is because the proposition "You are going to throw me into the water" is a [[Problem of future contingents|future contingent]] that could be true or false depending on what Plato is going to do. Dr. Joseph W. Ulatowski says that Buridan apparently used [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] thesis about what "truth" is to come up with this response. Aristotle believed that a proposition is true if and only if it is verified by the state of things as they currently are. Contradicting the [[principle of bivalence]], Buridan implies a system of  [[three-valued logic]] in which there are three [[truth value]]s--''true'', ''false'', and some indeterminate third value.&lt;ref name="Ulatowski"/&gt;

In determining the truth value of Plato's conditional promise, Buridan suggests that Plato's promise was false, and that because Plato gave his promise carelessly he is not obligated to fulfill the promise.&lt;ref name="Ulatowski"/&gt;

In discussing the third question, "What ought Plato to do to fulfill his promise", Buridan states that Plato should not have given a conditional promise in the first place. He also suggests that Plato could have made sure that the condition was formulated in such a way that it would not cause a contradiction; because Plato cannot fulfill his conditional promise without violating it, he is not obligated to fulfill the promise. Ulatowski points out that this interpretation is the [[contrapositive]] of a principle of [[Immanuel Kant]]: "ought implies can".&lt;ref name="Ulatowski"/&gt;

==Philosophers on the sophism and its solution==

In his solution to the sophism, [[Walter Burley]] (d. 1344/1345) applied the principle "nothing is true unless at this instant" (''"nihil est verum nisi in hoc instanti"'') and concluded that "if a proposition is true it must be true now".&lt;ref name="truth now"/&gt;

Dr. Dale Jacquette of the [[University of Bern]] says that "Plato can either permit Socrates to pass or have him seized and thrown into the river without violating his conditional vow". Jacquette argues that Plato's conditional promise was given only in regard to Socrates's proposition being clearly and unconditionally either true or false. To prove his point Jacquette asks, what would Plato have to do if Socrates had said nothing and was "as silent as a [[Sphinx]]", or if he uttered something that could not be either proven or "undisproven", something like [[Goldbach's conjecture]]. Jacquette concludes that Plato's conditional promise was true, and Socrates's proposition is "neither true ''simpliciter'' nor false ''simpliciter''", and therefore Plato would be right regardless of the choice that he made.&lt;ref name="Ulatowski"/&gt;

In his book ''Paradoxes from A to Z'' Professor Michael Clark comes to the conclusion that if Plato is an honorable man, Socrates should not get wet under any circumstances. Clark argues that Socrates could say, "Either I am speaking falsely, and you will throw me in, or I am speaking truly, and you won't throw me in". Clark says that if this sentence is true, then it means that the first alternative "is ruled out", leaving us only with the second one. If this sentence is false, it means that both alternatives are false, and because Socrates spoke falsely "it will be false" to throw him into the river.&lt;ref name="Paradoxes from A to Z"/&gt;  

Dr. Joseph W. Ulatowski believes that since the truth value in Plato's conditional promise and even more so in Socrates's proposition is indeterminate, it means that Plato "ought to err on the side of caution with respect to the future contingency and allow Socrates to cross the bridge".&lt;ref name="Ulatowski"/&gt; In the same work Ulatowski offers a couple of humorous solutions to the paradox. Plato, Ulatowski says, could let Socrates to cross the bridge, and then throw him into water on the other side. Or both Plato and Socrates could combine their efforts and forcibly eject Buridan himself from Buridan's bridge.&lt;ref name="Ulatowski"/&gt;

==In ''Don Quixote''==

Buridan's bridge sophism was used by [[Miguel de Cervantes]] in ''[[Don Quixote]]'',&lt;ref name="Paradoxes from A to Z"/&gt; when [[Sancho Panza|Sancho]] was presented with the Buridan's bridge dilemma: A man who was going to cross the bridge was asked to respond truthfully where he was going or otherwise to face a death by hanging. The man "swore and said that by the oath he took he was going to die upon that gallows that stood there, and nothing else."&lt;ref name="Don Quixote"/&gt;

Sancho summarizes the situation by saying: "the man swears that he is going to die upon the gallows; but if he dies upon it, he has sworn the truth, and by the law enacted deserves to go free and pass over the bridge; but if they don't hang him, then he has sworn falsely, and by the same law deserves to be hanged". He then comes up with the solution, "that of this man they should let pass the part that has sworn truly, and hang the part that has lied; and in this way the conditions of the passage will be fully complied with".&lt;ref name="Don Quixote"/&gt; After Sancho makes this statement, the person who was asking for advice reasons with him:{{quotation|"But then, senor governor," replied the querist, "the man will have to be divided into two parts; and if he is divided of course he will die; and so none of the requirements of the law will be carried out, and it is absolutely necessary to comply with it."&lt;ref name="Don Quixote"/&gt;}} Sancho comes up with the moral solution:{{quotation|...there is the same reason for this passenger dying as for his living and passing over the bridge; for if the truth saves him the falsehood equally condemns him; and that being the case it is my opinion you should say to the gentlemen who sent you to me that as the arguments for condemning him and for absolving him are exactly balanced, they should let him pass freely, as it is always more praiseworthy to do good than to do evil.&lt;ref name="Don Quixote"/&gt;}}

The concept can be traced back to [[Epicurus]] (341 BCE – 270 BCE),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.textlog.de/1533.html|title=Kirchner: Kasualismus|website=Textlog.de|accessdate=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; however most of the original sources dealing with the concept have been lost and most material today is based on [[Diogenes Laërtius]]'s  work ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'' (c. 3rd century CE), and copies plus developments by [[Titus Lucretius Carus|Lucretius]] (c. 99 BCE – c. 55 BCE) and [[Marcus Tullius Cicero|Cicero]] (3 January 106 BCE – 7 December 43 BCE).&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epicurus/ "Epicurus"], Plato.Stanford&lt;/ref&gt;

Casualism assumes the universe came into existence as a random event, and was not created by any omnipotent entity. Followers have therefore often been accused of [[atheism]]. Casualism has certain atheistic traits, but none of the ancient philosophers denied the existence of gods.&lt;ref name="iep"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/epicur/] {{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epicurus postulates that the gods simply stay out of the day-to-day running of the universe and are not even aware of the existence of man.&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iep"/&gt; The philosophy is based on observations of well known natural phenomena, such as ocean waves or the random fall of rain drops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/785?msg=welcome_stranger|title=On the Nature of Things by Titus Lucretius Carus|publisher=|accessdate=27 November 2018|website=Gutenberg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casualism is the concept of randomness as a philosophy.

'''Chronocentrism''' is the assumption that certain time periods (typically the [[present]]) are better, more important, or a more significant frame of reference than other time periods, either past or future.

==History==
Chronocentrism (from the Greek ''[[wikt:chrono-|chrono-]]'' meaning "time") was coined by sociologist Jib Fowles in an article in the journal ''Futures'' in February, 1974. Fowles described chronocentrism as "the belief that one's own times are paramount, that other periods pale in comparison".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fowles |first1=Jib |title=On Chronocentrism |work=Futures |volume=6 |number=1 |doi=10.1016/0016-3287(74)90008-1 |date=February 1974 |page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, it has been defined as "the egotism that one's own generation is poised on the very cusp of history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Standage |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Standage |title=[[The Victorian Internet|The Victorian Internet: The Remarkable Story of the Telegraph and the Nineteenth Century's On-line Pioneers]] |year=2007 |publisher=Walker &amp; Company |isbn=0-8027-1604-0 |pages=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term had been used earlier in a study about attitudes to ageing in the workplace. Chronocentricity: "...only seeing the value of one's own age cohort...described the tendency for younger managers to hold negative perceptions of the abilities or other work-related competencies of older employees."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lyon |first1=Phil |last2=Pollard |first2=D|title=Perceptions of the older employee: is anything really changing?|journal=Personnel Review|volume=26 |number=4 |doi=10.1108/00483489710172051|date=1 January 1997 |page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of discrimination is a form of [[ageism]].

==Ethnocentrism==

Chronocentrism as [[ethnocentrism]] is the perceiving and judging of a culture's historical values in terms of the standards of one's own time period.

==Antichronocentrism==

The [[Long Now Foundation]] is an organization that encourages the use of 5-digit years, e.g. "02016" instead of "2016," to help emphasize how early the present time is in their vision of the timeline of humanity.  The use of two-digit years before [[Y2K]] was an example of chronocentrism (in the early years of computing, the years 2000 and 1899 were believed to be too far in the future or the past, and thus of less importance than being able to save two digits in computerizing and typing out years).

==In science==
The "Copernican time principle" is a temporal analog of the [[Copernican principle]] for space, which states that no spatial location is any more or less special of a frame of reference than any other spatial location (i.e., that our physical universe has no center). Some authors have extended this to also include that no point in time is any more or less special than any other point in time (e.g., in outdated [[steady-state theories]]), though this cannot be universally applied (e.g., the [[Big-Bang singularity]] is a special point in time that can be logically used as a frame of reference to date later events.)

'''Civil courage''' is a type of courage, related closely to heroism, in which a person acts [[bravery|bravely]] to intervene in a social situation.

==Overview==
Italian journalist and writer {{ill|Franca Magnani|de}} (1925-1996) wrote, "Je mehr Bürger mit Zivilcourage ein Land hat, desto weniger Helden wird es einmal brauchen" ("The more citizens with civil courage which a country has, the fewer heroes it needs").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psychologie.uzh.ch/de/bereiche/sob/motivation/zivilcourage/zivilcourage.html |title=Über Zivilcourage |language=German |website=[[University of Zurich]] |accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civil Courage today ==

Civil courage has been referred to by [[psychologist]] Tobias Greitemeyer as constituting acts of [[bravery]], carried out with the objective of enforcing a societal or ethical standard, without concern for the effect these acts might have on one’s own position. In this way it is distinguished from [[alturism|altruistic]] behavior and other forms of courage. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greitemeyer|first1=Tobias|title=Civil courage: Implicit theories, related concepts, and measurement|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|volume=2|issue=2|pages=115–119|doi=10.1080/17439760701228789|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of altruistic, helping behavior, an individual might expect to be praised or receive positive social consequences from the result of their having helped, despite possible financial or material loss. In actions where civil courage is demonstrated, the person carrying out the action may experience negative social consequences such as alienation, verbal abuse or violence. Civil courage is displayed when a person, in spite of the perceived threat of negative consequences acts to intervene in a social context. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Osswald|first1=Silvia|title=What Is Moral Courage? Definition, Explication, and Classification of a Complex Construct|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2557/541097a464168d2fbadae632288150fdf2de.pdf|website=Semanticsscholar.org|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Critical practice''' is the methodology used by a [[critic]] or observer to understand and evaluate a [[Field of study|field of knowledge]].  While sometimes the fields of knowledge studied are academic, non-academic fields such as merchandising, law enforcement and medical clinical practice have been extensively studied. Critical practice is grounded in the concepts of [[critical theory]]. Consultants employing critical practice skills aim to help people improve outcomes. Analysis is applied to groups working in a particular area of expertise and with identifiable practice skills, and usually to a defined range of problems and situations. Thus, practice tends to be based on a restricted view of people and their problems with a limited range of values applied in that practice.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} 

Critical practice aims to develop the ability and skill to see beyond the usual concerns of any given profession, into its unintended side effects, causes and consequences, and to do so from a critical and evaluative perspective.

Thus, for example, the profession of [[social work]] might be practiced critically through practitioners being conscious that their role may be seen, and could operate, as an agent of [[social control]], rather than just one of promoting some degree of liberation or of empowerment. In such a case the practitioner would be both the observer and the observed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5369">In [[philosophy]] and [[sociology]], '''culturalism (new humanism''' or '''Znaniecki's humanism''') is the central importance of culture as an organizing force in human affairs.&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-12"&gt;Hałas (2010), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-214"&gt;Hałas (2010), p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-186-187" /&gt; It was originally coined by the Polish-American philosopher and sociologist [[Florian Znaniecki]] in his book ''[[Cultural Reality]]'' (1919) in English and later translated into Polish as ''kulturalizm''.  Znaniecki had introduced a similar concept in earlier Polish language publications which he described as ''humanism'' (''humanizm'').&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-186-187"&gt;Dulczewski (1984), pp. 186–187.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Znaniecki's culturalism was based on philosophies and theories of [[Matthew Arnold]] ([[Culture and Anarchy]]), [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] ([[Voluntarism (metaphysics)|voluntarism]]), [[Henri Bergson]] ([[creative evolutionism]]), [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] ([[philosophy of life]]), [[William James]], [[John Dewey]]  ([[pragmatism]]) and [[Ferdinand C. Schiller]] ([[humanism]]).&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-51"/&gt;

Znaniecki was critical of a number of then-prevalent philosophical viewpoints: [[intellectualism]],&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-52"&gt;Hałas (2010), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; [[idealism]]&lt;ref name="StråthWitoszek1999-129130"&gt;{{cite book|author=Piotr Kawecki|chapter=Heroism and Intimacy of Post-modern Morality|editor1=Bo Stråth|editor2=Nina Witoszek|title=The Postmodern Challenge: Perspectives East and West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-2FeRqCaOgoC&amp;pg=PA129|year=1999|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-420-0755-0|pages=129–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philosophical realism|realism]]&lt;ref name="StråthWitoszek1999-129130"/&gt; [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-186-187"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StråthWitoszek1999-129130"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-21"&gt;Hałas (2010), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[rationalism]].&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-186-187"/&gt; He was also critical of [[irrationalism]] and [[intuitionism]].&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-52"/&gt;

==Characteristics==
In response to these criticisms, Znaniecki proposed a new theoretical framework.&lt;ref name="StråthWitoszek1999-129130"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-21"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sztompka2002-5253"&gt;Sztompka (2002), pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt; His "culturalism" was an [[ontological]] and [[epistemological]] approach aiming to eliminate dualisms such as the belief that nature and culture are opposite realities.&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-21"/&gt;

This approach allowed him to "define [[social phenomena]] in cultural terms".&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-12"/&gt; Znaniecki was arguing for the importance of [[culture]], noting that our culture shapes our view of the world and our thinking.&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-187-188"&gt;Dulczewski (1984), pp. 187–188.&lt;/ref&gt; Znaniecki notes that while the world is composed of physical artifacts, we are not really capable of studying the physical world other than through the lenses of culture.&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-189"&gt;Dulczewski (1984), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the fundamental aspects of the philosophy of culturalism are two categories: value and action.&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-21"/&gt; [[Elżbieta Hałas]], who calls it an "antithesis to the intellectual dogmas of naturalism", identifies the following assumptions:&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-52"/&gt;
* "The subject-object dualism must be overcome and thought should be united with reality."
* "Reality is not an absolute order but changes in a creative evolution."
* "All images of the world are relative."
* "It is false to oppose nature and culture or to subordinate culture to nature."
* "Value is the most general category of the description of reality."

Znaniecki's philosophy of culturalism laid the foundation for his larger theoretical system, based around another concept of his, "[[humanistic coefficient]]."&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-55"&gt;Hałas (2010), pp. 55, 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Through originally a philosophical concept,&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-186-187"/&gt; culturalism was further developed by Znaniecki to inform his sociological theories.&lt;ref name="Hałas2010-51"&gt;Hałas (2010), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Znaniecki's culturalism influenced modern sociological views of [[antipositivism]] and [[antinaturalism (sociology)|antinaturalism]].&lt;ref name="Sztompka2002-2425"&gt;Sztompka (2002), p. 2425.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Early modern philosophy''' (also '''classical modern philosophy''')&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Tlumak, ''Classical Modern Philosophy: A Contemporary Introduction'', Routledge, 2006, p. xi: "[''Classical Modern Philosophy''] is a guide through the systems of the seven brilliant seventeenth- and eighteenth-century European philosophers most regularly taught in college Modern Philosophy courses".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schacht"&gt;[[Richard Schacht]], ''Classical Modern Philosophers: Descartes to Kant'', Routledge, 2013, p. 1: "Seven men have come to stand out from all of their counterparts in what has come to be known as the 'modern' period in the history of philosophy (i.e., the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries): Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume and Kant".&lt;/ref&gt; is a period in the [[history of philosophy]] at the beginning or overlapping with the period known as [[modern philosophy]].

==Overview==
The [[early modern period]] in history is roughly 1500–1789,&lt;ref&gt;[[Marshall Berman]]. 1982. ''[[All That Is Solid Melts into Air]]: The Experience of Modernity''. New York: Simon and Schuster. {{ISBN|0-671-24602-X}}. London: Verso. pp. 16–17. {{ISBN|0-86091-785-1}}. Paperback reprint New York: Viking Penguin, 1988. {{ISBN|0-14-010962-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but the label "early modern philosophy" is usually used to refer to a more specific period of time.

In the narrowest sense, the term is used to refer principally to the [[17th-century philosophy|philosophy of the 17th century]], posited to have begun with [[René Descartes]]; to have included [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Baruch Spinoza]]; and to have ended with [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] and [[Isaac Newton]]. Many stretch this period to [[18th-century philosophy]] (the [[Age of Enlightenment]]), thus including [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]], and [[David Hume]].&lt;ref name="Schacht"/&gt;

The term is sometimes used more broadly and early modern philosophy is considered to have begun in the 16th century&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Leiter]] (ed.), ''The Future for Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 44 n. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]]; to have also included [[Michel Eyquem de Montaigne]], [[Francis Bacon]], [[Giambattista Vico]], [[Voltaire]] and [[Thomas Paine]]; and to have ended at the latest in 1804 with the death of [[Immanuel Kant]].  Considered in this way, the period spans from [[Renaissance philosophy]] to the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

'''Eidetic reduction''' is a technique in the study of [[essence]]s in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] whose goal is to identify the basic components of phenomena. Eidetic reduction requires that a phenomenologist examine the essence of a mental object, be it a simple mental act, or the unity of consciousness itself, with the intention of drawing out the absolutely necessary and invariable components that make the mental object what it is.  This reduction is done with the intention of removing what is perceived, and leaving only what is required.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.american.edu/cas/sociology/ast/upload/Outline_e.pdf Gert H. Mueller. ''Analytical Sociology: An Outline'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
One can take for example [[René Descartes|Descartes]]'s [[Wax argument|piece of wax]] (not as a mental object, but as a demonstration of the concept of reduction). It appears to be opaque, flat, hard, extended to certain dimensions in space. It has a certain feel, smell, taste. Most of these qualities can be negated as necessary to the piece of wax continuing to be a piece of wax; the smell, taste, texture, opacity. If heated, it will continue to be the same piece of wax, the same molecules. However, the taste may change, the smell may become more noticeable, the texture will obviously change, it will become clear if heated to the point of melting, etc. The only things that remain (its extension into space, chemical makeup, and mass) are the things that are required for the existence of that piece of wax. 

Eidetic reduction is a form of [[imaginative variation]] by which one attempts to reduce a phenomenon into its necessary essences. This is done by theoretically changing different elements (while mentally observing whether or not the phenomenon changes) of a practical object to learn which characteristics are necessary for it to be it without being something else. If a characteristic is changed, and the object remains unchanged, the characteristic is unnecessary to the essence of the object, and vice versa.

The basic steps of an eidetic reduction are threefold: first, choose some specific example (e.g., Descartes' wax). Then, vary the example imaginatively. The third step involves figuring out that which cannot be eliminated while the example remains itself. That which cannot be eliminated is part of the example's essence.

As an instructive process, eidetic reduction might be viewed as processes of abstraction; the works of [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] in their ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' could give one a taste of those processes, or even the simple contemplation of mathematics itself in use: "How many ideas have you?" and the respondent may claim, "Just two."

In [[philosophy of science]], the '''empirical limits of science''' define problems with [[observation]], and thus are limits of human ability to inquire and answer questions about phenomena. These include topics such as [[infinity]], [[the future]] and [[god]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/scientific-experiments/scientific-method10.htm|agency=How Stuff Works|accessdate=6 March 2018|title=Limitations of the Scientific Method|author=William Harris}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century several of these were well-documented or proposed in [[physics]]:

*The [[Planck length]] - actually a limit on [[distance]] itself.
*The [[Schrödinger's cat]] [[paradox]].
*The [[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]].
*The theorized [[event horizon]] of a [[black hole]] in [[special relativity]].
*The cosmological horizon of the [[observable universe]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19136">'''Exclusivism''' is the practice of being [[:wikt:exclusive|exclusive]]; [[mentality]] characterized by the disregard for opinions and ideas other than one's own, or the practice of organizing entities into groups by excluding those entities which possess certain traits. (for an opposite example, see [[essentialism]]).

==Religious exclusivism==
{{Main|Chosen people|One true faith}}
Religious exclusivism, one of the three classic typologies created by [[Alan Race]] in order to describe religions relative to one another, states that one religion, to the exclusion of all others, has the correct understanding of God, truth and salvation. [[Diana L. Eck|Diana Eck]] states, ‘Exclusivism is more than simply a conviction about the transformative power of the particular vision one has; it is a conviction about its finality and its absolute priority over competing views’.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, Douglas. "Exclusivism and Exclusivity: A Contemporary Theological Challenge." ''Pacifica'' 20.3 (2007): 296.&lt;/ref&gt; While it was originally used to define Christianity, exclusivism can apply to any religious belief system, as can Race’s other two categories [[inclusivism]] and [[Religious pluralism|pluralism]]. In his 1982 ''[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Christians-Religious-Pluralism-Christian-Religions/dp/0334019389/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1521581557&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=alan+Race+religious+pluralism Christians and Religious Pluralism],'' Race defined pluralism as all religions being equally beneficial, with no single religion dominating. Inclusivism attempts to straddle the poles of pluralism and exclusivism by agreeing with the latter that one religion (Christianity) has the most value, and agreeing with the former by stating that other religions still have significant value.&lt;ref&gt;Tuggy, Dale. "Religious Diversity, Theories Of." ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; While Race’s three categories have been criticized, amended and refuted, most religious studies and interfaith scholars and students find the typologies useful as a starting point for conversations about the diversity of religions.&lt;ref&gt;D'Costa, Gavin. "The Impossibility of a Pluralist View of Religions." ''Religious Studies'' 32.2 (1996): 223-24&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic Three-point typology ==

=== Pluralism ===
Pluralism was borne out of a criticism of exclusivism, saying that no single tradition has a monopoly on revelation or salvation, and that we have no way to judge between the salvific claims by adherents of any faith tradition.  [https://www.rsis.edu.sg/profile/paul-hedges/#.WrF9WMPFLDc Paul Hedges] suggests that each religion knows ‘transcendent reality (“God”) yet in partial perspective,’ much like the oft-quoted parable of the seven blind men and the elephant.&lt;ref&gt;Hedges, Paul. “A Reflection on Typologies: Negotiating a Fast-Moving Discussion.” ''Christian Approaches to Other Faiths''. Paul Hedges and Alan Race, eds. (London: SCM, 2008): 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Gavin D'Costa|Gavin D’costa]]  says pluralists have two main critiques of exclusivists: people of other religions are god and loving and that they do not know their own Scriptures well enough.&lt;ref&gt;D'Costa, Gavin. "The Impossibility of a Pluralist View of Religions." ''Religious Studies'' 32.2 (1996): 227.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alvin Plantinga]] says that pluralist’s problem with exclusivism stems from its immorality and arrogance. He quotes William Cantwell Smith: ‘Except at the cost of insensitivity or delinquency, it is morally not possible actually to go out into the world and say to devout, intelligent, fellow human beings: “…we believe that we know God and we are right; you believe that you know God, and you are totally wrong.”’&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga, Alan. “Pluralism: A Defense of Religious Exclusivism.” ''The Rationality of Belief and the Plurality of Faith'', Thomas D. Senor (ed). (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1995): 176.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Smith, the leading proponent of pluralism is John Hick, who writes:

[Exclusivism], with its baleful historical influence, in validating centuries of anti-semitism, the colonial exploitation by Christian Europe of what today we call the third world, and the subordination of women within a strongly patriarchal religious system, not only causes misgivings among many Christians but also alarms many of our non-Christian neighbors, creating invisible but powerful barriers within the human community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pluralism and Particularity in Religious Belief|last=Stetson|first=Brad|publisher=Praeger|year=1994|isbn=|location=Westport CT and London|pages=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is worth noting that D’costa argued persuasively that logically, pluralism can no longer be considered a category; when it makes a declarative truth claim, it becomes another form of exclusivism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=D'Costa|first=Gavin|date=1996|title=The Impossibility of a Pluralist View of Religions 32.2 (1996): 223-32|url=|journal=Religious Studies|volume=32:2|pages=225|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inclusivism ===
Inclusivists state that while one religion or revelation is true (Christianity), other truths can be found in fragments within other religions.&lt;ref&gt;D'Costa, Gavin. "The Impossibility of a Pluralist View of Religions." ''Religious Studies'' 32.2 (1996): 225.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Rahner]] states it succinctly: ‘Insofar as they in good conscience practice what is good in their religion, people in other religions receive God’s grace and are “anonymous Christians,” people who are being saved through Christ, though they do not realize it.’ &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tuggy|first=Dale|date=2015|title=Religious Diversity, Theories Of|url=|journal=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inclusivists point to the biblical parable of the sheep and the goats in which the saved sheep show surprise at being rewarded for their service to [[Jesus]] (Matthew 25: 31-40)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moser|first=Paul|date=2010|title=Religious Exclusivism|url=|journal=The Oxford Handbook of Religious Diversity|volume=|pages=86|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exclusivism in Christianity and other religions ===
According to Race, the history of the Abrahamic faiths’ exclusivism – as well as inclusivism – goes back to the words of the Bible and the Qur’an.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Race, Alan. “Theologies of Religions in Change: Factors in the Shape of a Debate.” ''Christian Approaches to Other Faiths''. Paul Hedges and Alan Race, eds. (London: SCM, 2008): 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Christian exclusivists point to John’s gospel (14: 6), which quotes Jesus as saying, ‘I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.’ After Jesus’ death, his disciple Peter said publicly, ‘Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved’ (Acts 4:12). Likewise, the Qur’an (3:85) states, ‘If anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to Allah), never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter He will be in the ranks of those who have lost (all spiritual good).’ While Judaism does not stress salvation, the First Commandment (Exodus 20:3) is ‘You shall have no other gods before me.’ Race says, ‘The tension between Christian experience and the recognition of potential authentic practice outside of the Christian revelation, in fact has always existed in Christian history from the beginning, from the words of Jesus himself in the gospel of Luke: in 9:50 he says, “He who is ''not against'' us is for us”’.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Daniel Strange points out what Race neglects to mention: that in the same gospel (11:23), Jesus says, ‘He who is ''not with me'' is against me.’&lt;ref&gt;Strange, Daniel. “Exclusivisms: ‘Indeed Their Rock is Not like Our Rock.’ ''Christian Approaches to Other Faiths''. Paul Hedges and Alan Race, eds. (London: SCM, 2008) 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

== No salvation outside the Church ==
The exclusivist idea of ‘no salvation outside of the Christian church’ (''[[Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus|Extra ecclesiam nulla salus]]'') has roots as early as [[Origen]] in the third century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; And while the Bible speaks about many topics of inclusion, diversity and tolerance in both the Old and New Testament – attitudes toward the alien and stranger; the hope of Christians being drawn from all nations and languages; God’s universal care and sustaining of creation; the universal scope of the gospel and the universal mandate to take the gospel to the nations&lt;ref&gt;Strange, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; – the overwhelming feeling in the Church throughout most of its history mimics that of the [[Council of Florence]] in 1422: ‘The Council firmly believes, professes and proclaims that those not living within the Catholic Church, not only pagans, but Jews, heretics and schismatics, cannot participate in eternal life, but will depart into everlasting fire which has been prepared for the devil and his [sic] angels.’&lt;ref&gt;Strange, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther]] continued the exclusivist theological bent: ‘For where Christ is not preached, there is no Holy Spirit to create, call and gather the Christian Church, and outside it no one can come to the Lord Christ’.&lt;ref&gt;Strange, 41&lt;/ref&gt; The door in the exclusivist castle opened a crack during the 20th century missionary movement, when Dutch missiologist [[Hendrik Kraemer]] wrote that Jesus is the one who has the complete authority to judge other religions’ efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;Strange, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Highlighting a unique contemporary take on the salvation problem, Strange introduces [[George Lindbeck]]’s contention that those who do not know the Bible cannot be condemned for their lack of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Strange, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

== New wave of exclusivism ==
Mara Brecht states that the problem with classic exclusivism is that it deals mainly with Christianity and salvation (or ‘top down’). She highlights the work of the ‘New Wave of exclusivism,’ led by Griffiths, D’costa and Netland, who employ a ‘bottom up’ approach to religious diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, Mara. "What's the use of Exclusivism?" ''Theological Studies'' 73.1 (2012): 34.&lt;/ref&gt; New Wave Exclusivists focus more on the religious believers’ ‘ways of knowing and understanding of religious beliefs as expressive truth,’ resulting in a broader possibility for interfaith engagement.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 34.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Netland sets aside comparing religions’ salvation when he says dialogue should focus on the most important question all religions deal with – the question of truth.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Brecht reaches the conclusion that exclusivism is tenable for Christians – and by extension other religious believers – if believers come into contact with believers of other religions who can possibly ‘defeat’ their own, so they can have something to base their truth claims on. Brecht says, ‘Practically, this means that, for example, reflective Christians will consider their beliefs to be as ''probable'' as alternatives from within their own tradition, ''somewhat more probable than'' the relevant alternatives from within Judaism and ''considerably more probable than'' Buddhist alternatives. In other words, believers will weigh their beliefs against other beliefs.’&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Divisions of exclusivism ==
Douglas Pratt further defines exclusivism, dividing it into three subdivisions – open, closed and extreme. Citing t’Hooft and Kraemer, Pratt says open exclusivism, while never ceding the superior position, ‘may at least be amenably disposed toward the other,’ if only in order to know Them well enough for possible conversion. The relationship is not entered into on equal ground, therefore, nor with the openness to a significant reciprocal change of self-identity. If dialogue is entered into, it is only for mutual edification and an increase in good will.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, Douglas. "Exclusivism and Exclusivity: A Contemporary Theological Challenge." ''Pacifica'' 20.3 (2007): 297.&lt;/ref&gt; Closed exclusivism offers no chance for a relationship, other than acknowledging the other’s right to exist.  An extreme, hard-line exclusivism often leads to a fundamentalist perspective. Pratt writes, ‘Fundamentalism, as a mindset, is a mentality that expresses the modern quest for universality and coherence writ large: only one truth; one authority; one authentic narrative that accounts for all; one right way to be.’&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, 293.&lt;/ref&gt; The logical conclusion for this fundamentalist mindset is taking steps to eliminate the other, as one would a business competitor. Pratt writes, ‘The negation of otherness is perhaps critical, for it involves a devaluing and dismissal of the "other," whether in terms of rival community or competing alterities, ideological or otherwise. In the process of negating the other, the self is asserted as inherently superior. My God is greater than your god.’&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, 298-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Moser]] posits two forms of exclusivism: logical religious exclusivism, which asserts that since the contradictory, foundational truth claims for each religion excludes some or many of them from being true;&lt;ref&gt;Moser, Paul K. "Religious Exclusivism." ''The Oxford Handbook of Religious Diversity'' (2010): 78.&lt;/ref&gt; and the doxastic redemptive exclusivism based on the Athanasian Creed, which states if a person does not believe the Christian concept of the Trinity, that person is condemned. Moser further believes that a God who would exclude people from salvation for neither hearing nor understanding the concept of the Trinity does not have a moral character, and is therefore undeserving of worship.&lt;ref&gt;Moser, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exclusivism in other religions ==
While most attention of exclusivism points toward Christianity, each religion has a branch that falls into the exclusivist category. D’costa&lt;ref&gt;D'cost, 224.&lt;/ref&gt; points out whether one considers oneself Buddhist or Hindu or Muslim – or indeed a pluralist – each version states that ‘only one single revelation or one single religion is true and all other “revelations” or religions are false.’ While acknowledging that historically, Christianity showed the most extreme forms of exclusivism, Pratt contends that many fundamentalist religions compete for that title, with Islam leading other worthy contenders&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, 298.&lt;/ref&gt; in ways that are not always obvious. With the purging of the [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] in [[Myanmar]], the Buddhist Rakhine have joined the ranks of fundamentalists willing to resort to killing to achieve dominance over competing religions.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Morgan. “Love Thy Neighbor: South Asia Christians Advocate for Rohingya Muslims.” ''Christianity Today'', Oct. 27, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Ancient Greece==
The Decree of Diopithes (430 BCE) forbade the worship of and belief in gods other than those of the Olympian pantheon recognised by the Athenian polis. The introduction of other gods was treated as ''asebeia'', or [[impiety]], and was punishable by death. The philosophers [[Anaxagoras]], [[Protagoras]], [[Socrates]], [[Stilpo]], [[Theodorus the Atheist|Theodorus of Cyrene]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Theophrastus]] were accused of impiety under this decree. Socrates was found guilty of the charge of introducing new gods and condemned to death by drinking [[conium|hemlock]].

[[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]], [[Selucid]] ruler of Israel, decided to Hellenize the Jews by ordering the worship of Zeus; when they refused, Antiochus sent an army to enforce his decree.

According to [[Herodotus]] the Caunians, a Greek people who claimed to have originated in Crete and settled in Asia Minor, worshiped the Olympian Gods exclusively. "They determined that they would no longer make use of the foreign temples which had been established among them, but would worship their own old ancestral Gods alone. Then their whole youth took arms, and striking the air with their spears, marched to the Calyndic frontier, declaring that they were driving out the foreign Gods."

[[Plato]], in his Laws, advocates that the state should punish those who deny the existence of the Olympian Gods or believe that the gods exist but think they are indifferent to mankind or can be easily bought by bribes.

''[[Interpretatio graeca]]'', the common tendency of ancient Greek writers to identify foreign divinities with members of their own pantheon, can be seen as a kind of exclusivism. The [[syncretism]] of the [[Hellenistic]] period whereby aspects of the cults of foreign Gods such as iconography and epithets, can also be seen as a kind of exclusivism.

=== Exclusivism and religious diversity in America ===
In a sociological survey of Americans and their relationship with religions other than Christianity, nearly 90 percent of respondents either strongly or somewhat agreed that “religious diversity has been good for America,” which reinforces the idea that Americans value diversity and religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Merino, Stephen. "Religious Diversity in a "Christian Nation": The Effects of Theological Exclusivity and Interreligious Contact on the Acceptance of Religious Diversity." ''Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion'' 49.2 (2010): 237.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, respondents who identified in the exclusivist category or believed that the United States was a Christian nation displayed much more negative views and a decreased willingness to include other religious people in the lives of their community.&lt;ref&gt;Merino, 243.&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Merino concludes, ‘It may be that when many Americans think of “religious diversity,” they have only Christian diversity in mind.’ &lt;ref&gt;Merino, 244.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, they also provided research to back up their statement, ''‘''Prior contact with non-Christians will be associated with more positive views of religious diversity and increased willingness to include non-Christians into social life.’ &lt;ref&gt;Merino, 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exclusivism and truth ===
In answering the pluralist charge, and hearkening back to Netland, Brad Stetson baldly states, ‘It is possible exclusivism is true.’ &lt;ref&gt;Stetson, 115.&lt;/ref&gt; It is this statement, he says, that upsets pluralists who charge exclusivists with arrogance and bad form. ‘It is simply not true, as pluralists imply, that disagreeing with someone […] about religious truth is tantamount to treating them badly.[…] [a]n exclusivist claim about religious truth is not defeated strictly because such claims are believed to militate against human harmony and peace.' &lt;ref&gt;Stetson, 118.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Hick, Smith and other pluralists balk at the idea that an all-loving God would condemn some people to hell,&lt;ref&gt;Stetson, 119.&lt;/ref&gt; nor that anyone actually deserves to be damned;&lt;ref name="Stetson, 123"&gt;Stetson, 123.&lt;/ref&gt; he then quotes CS Lewis: ‘The doors of hell are locked on the ''inside.’'' &lt;ref name="Stetson, 123"/&gt;

'''Existential phenomenology''' is [[Martin Heidegger]]'s brand of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (1998): [https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/phenomenological-movement/existential-phenomenology "Phenomenological movement: 4. Existential phenomenology].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In contrast with his former mentor [[Edmund Husserl]], Heidegger (in his ''[[Being and Time]]'') put [[ontology]] before [[epistemology]] and thought that phenomenology would have to be based on an observation and analysis of ''[[Dasein]]'' ("being-there"), human being, investigating the fundamental ontology of the ''Lebenswelt'' ([[lifeworld]], Husserl's term) underlying all so-called regional ontologies of the special sciences. In Heidegger's philosophy, people are thrown into the world in a given situation, but they are also a project towards the future, possibility, freedom, wait, hope, anguish.&lt;ref&gt;Farina, Gabriella (2014). [http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A14-07.pdf Some reflections on the phenomenological method.] ''Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences'', '''7'''(2):50–62.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast with the philosopher [[Kierkegaard]], Heidegger wanted to explore the problem of ''Dasein'' existentially (''existenzial''), rather than [[existentiell]]y (''existenziell'') because Heidegger argued Kierkegaard had already described the latter with "penetrating fashion".{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Development==
Besides Heidegger, other existential phenomenologists were [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Karl Jaspers]], [[Emmanuel Levinas]], [[Gabriel Marcel]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Frantz Fanon]],  [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Enzo Paci|it}} and [[Samuel Todes]].

==Other disciplines==
Existential phenomenology extends also to other disciplines. For example, [[Leo Steinberg]]'s essay "[[The Philosophical Brothel]]" describes Picasso's ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' in a perspective that is existential-phenomenological. It has also impacted [[architectural theory]], especially in the phenomenological and Heideggerian approaches to space, place, dwelling, technology, etc.&lt;ref&gt;This is evident in the works of [[Christian Norberg-Schulz]], as for example is the case with his book: ''Genius Loci, Towards a Phenomenology of Architecture'' (New York: Rizzoli, 1980), or more recently with the numerous papers of [[Nader El-Bizri]] such as his paper: 'On Dwelling: Heideggerian Allusions to Architectural Phenomenology', ''Studia UBB Philosophia'' Volume 60 (2015): 5–30. This is also felt with the practices of architects in the [[Phenomenology (architecture)]] movement&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Experimentalism''' is the philosophical belief that the way to truth is through [[experiment]]s and [[empiricism]].&lt;ref name="Dictionary1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/experimentalism |title=Experimentalism |work=Your Dictionary |publisher=LoveToKnow Corporation |accessdate=29 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also associated with [[instrumentalism]], the belief that truth should be evaluated based upon its demonstrated usefulness. Deborah Mayo suggests that we should focus on how experimental knowledge is actually arrived at and how it functions in science&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Worrall|first=John|last2=Mayo|first2=Deborah G.|last3=Smart|first3=J. J.

Mayo also suggests that the reason New Experimentalists have come up short, is that the part of experiments that have the most to offer in building an account of inference and evidence that are left untapped: designing, generating, modelling and analysing experiments and data.

Less formally, artists often pursue their visions through trial and error; [[experimental arts|this form]] of experimentalism has been practiced in every field, from [[Experimental music|music]] to [[Experimental film|film]] and from [[Experimental literature|literature]] to [[Experimental theatre|theatre]].

In [[philosophy of language]], a context in which a sub-sentential expression ''e'' appears is called extensional if and only if ''e'' can be replaced by an expression with the same extension and necessarily preserve [[truth-value]].  The [[Extension (semantics)|extension]] of a term is the set of objects that that term denotes.

Take the case of [[Clark Kent]], who is secretly [[Superman]].  Suppose that [[Lois Lane]] fell out of a window and Superman caught her.  Thus the statement, "Clark Kent caught Lois Lane," is true because it has an '''extensional context'''.  The names "Superman" and "Clark Kent" have the same extension, which is to say that they both refer to the same person, i.e., that superhero who is vulnerable to [[kryptonite]].  Anybody that Superman caught, Clark Kent caught.

In opposition to extensional contexts are intensional contexts, where synonymous terms cannot be substituted in without potentially compromising the truth-value. Suppose that Lois Lane believes that Clark Kent will investigate a news story with her.  The statement, "Lois Lane believes that Superman will investigate a news story with her," is false, even though Superman is Clark Kent.  This is because 'believes' is typically an intensional context.

[[File:Abm2.jpg|thumb|300px|A photo showing a boy jumping into a body of water. It is widely believed that humans make decisions (e.g. jumping in the water) based on free will.]]

'''Free will''' is the ability to [[Choice|choose]] between different possible courses of [[Action (philosophy)|action]] unimpeded.&lt;ref&gt;Omoregie, J. (2015).
 Freewill: The degree of freedom within. UK: Author House | {{ISBN|9781504987516}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hegeler, Edward C. (1910). ''The Monist'', Vol. 20. Open Court. p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

Free will is closely linked to the concepts of [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]], [[praise]], [[Culpability|guilt]], [[sin]], and other judgements which apply only to actions that are freely chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/area.12339|title = Demonic geographies| journal=Area| volume=49| issue=4| pages=503–509|year = 2017|last1 = Simandan|first1 = Dragos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumeister, R.F 2014. pp. 1-52"&gt;Baumeister, R.F. and Monroe, A.E., 2014. Recent research on free will: Conceptualizations, beliefs, and processes. In Advances in Experimental Social Psychology (Vol. 50, pp. 1-52). Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also connected with the concepts of [[Advice (opinion)|advice]], [[persuasion]], [[deliberation]], and [[Prohibitionism|prohibition]]. Traditionally, only actions that are freely [[Will (philosophy)|will]]ed are seen as deserving credit or blame. There are numerous different concerns about threats to the possibility of free will, varying by how exactly it is conceived, which is a matter of some debate.

Some conceive free will to be the capacity to make choices in which the outcome has not been determined by past events. [[Determinism]] suggests that only one course of events is possible, which is inconsistent with the existence of free will thus conceived.&lt;ref name="Baumeister, R.F 2014. pp. 1-52"/&gt; This problem has been identified in [[ancient Greek philosophy]]&lt;ref name=bobzien1998determinism /&gt; and remains a major focus of philosophical debate. This view that conceives free will to be incompatible with determinism is called ''[[incompatibilism]]'' and encompasses both [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|metaphysical libertarianism]], the claim that determinism is false and thus free will is at least possible, and [[hard determinism]], the claim that determinism is true and thus free will is not possible. It also encompasses [[hard incompatibilism]], which holds not only determinism but also its negation to be incompatible with free will and thus free will to be impossible whatever the case may be regarding determinism.

In contrast, ''[[compatibilism|compatibilists]]'' hold that free will ''is'' compatible with determinism. Some compatibilists even hold that determinism is ''necessary'' for free will, arguing that choice involves preference for one course of action over another, requiring a sense of ''how'' choices will turn out.&lt;ref name=Carnap&gt;An argument by [[Rudolph Carnap]] described by: {{cite book |title=Research In Psychology: Methods and Design |author=C. James Goodwin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eNsVUGTMcDoC&amp;pg=PA11 |page=11 |isbn=978-0470522783 |publisher=Wiley |year=2009 |edition=6th}}

Classical compatibilists considered free will nothing more than freedom of action, considering one free of will simply if, ''had'' one counterfactually wanted to do otherwise, one ''could'' have done otherwise without physical impediment. Contemporary compatibilists instead identify free will as a psychological capacity, such as to direct one's behavior in a way responsive to reason, and there are still further different conceptions of free will, each with their own concerns, sharing only the common feature of not finding the possibility of determinism a threat to the possibility of free will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/compatibilism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first1=Michael|last1=McKenna|first2=D.

The underlying questions are whether we have control over our actions, and if so, what sort of control, and to what extent. These questions predate the early Greek [[Stoicism|stoics]] (for example, [[Chrysippus]]), and some modern philosophers lament the lack of progress over all these centuries.&lt;ref name=Nagel&gt;

It is difficult to reconcile the intuitive evidence that conscious decisions are causally effective with the view that the physical world can be explained to operate perfectly by [[physical law]].&lt;ref name="Velmans2002"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=9 |issue=11 |pages=2–29 |author=Max Velmans |title=How Could Conscious Experiences Affect Brains? |url=http://cogprints.org/2750/ |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict between intuitively felt freedom and natural law arises when either [[causal closure]] or [[physical determinism]] ([[nomological determinism]]) is asserted. With causal closure, no physical event has a cause outside the physical domain, and with physical determinism, the future is determined entirely by preceding events (cause and effect).

The puzzle of reconciling 'free will' with a deterministic universe is known as the ''problem of free will'' or sometimes referred to as the ''dilemma of determinism''.&lt;ref name=WJames&gt;{{cite book |title=The Will to believe, and other essays in popular philosophy |author=William James |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2Tw28d-85wC&amp;pg=PA145 |pages=145 ''ff'' |chapter=The dilemma of determinism |publisher=Longmans, Green |year=1896}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dilemma leads to a [[morality|moral]] dilemma as well: the question of how to assign [[moral responsibility|responsibility]] for actions if they are caused entirely by past events.&lt;ref name=Bargh&gt;

A different approach to the dilemma is that of [[incompatibilism|incompatibilists]], namely, that if the world is deterministic, then our feeling that we are free to choose an action is simply an [[hard determinism|illusion]]. [[Metaphysical libertarianism]] is the form of incompatibilism which posits that [[determinism]] is false and free will is possible (at least some people have free will).&lt;ref name="stanfordcompatibilism" /&gt; This view is associated with [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|non-materialist]] constructions,&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt; including both traditional [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Substance or Cartesian dualism|dualism]], as well as models supporting more minimal criteria; such as the ability to consciously veto an action or competing desire.&lt;ref name="Libet 2003"&gt;Libet, (2003). "Can Conscious Experience affect brain Activity?", ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 10, nr. 12, pp. 24–28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RKane1" /&gt; Yet even with [[indeterminism|physical indeterminism]], arguments have been made against libertarianism in that it is difficult to assign ''Origination'' (responsibility for "free" indeterministic choices).

Free will here is predominately treated with respect to [[physical determinism]] in the strict sense of [[nomological determinism]], although other forms of determinism are also relevant to free will.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismarguments /&gt; For example, logical and [[theological determinism|theological]] determinism challenge metaphysical libertarianism with ideas of [[destiny]] and [[fate]], and [[biological determinism|biological]], [[cultural determinism|cultural]] and [[psychological determinism|psychological]] determinism feed the development of compatibilist models. Separate classes of [[compatibilism]] and [[incompatibilism]] may even be formed to represent these.&lt;ref name="stanfordforeknowledge"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Zagzebski |first=Linda |editor=Edward N.

Below are the classic arguments bearing upon the dilemma and its underpinnings.

===Incompatibilism===
{{Main|Incompatibilism}}
Incompatibilism is the position that free will and determinism are logically incompatible, and that the major question regarding whether or not people have free will is thus whether or not their actions are determined. "Hard determinists", such as [[Baron d'Holbach|d'Holbach]], are those incompatibilists who accept determinism and reject free will. In contrast, "[[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|metaphysical libertarians]]", such as [[Thomas Reid]], [[Peter van Inwagen]], and [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]], are those incompatibilists who accept free will and deny determinism, holding the view that some form of indeterminism is true.&lt;ref name="Wagen"&gt;van Invagen, P. (1983) ''An Essay on Free Will''. Oxford: [[Clarendon Press]]. {{ISBN|0-19-824924-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another view is that of hard incompatibilists, which state that free will is incompatible with both [[determinism]] and [[indeterminism]].&lt;ref name="Derk1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pereboom, D. |year=2003 |title=Living without Free Will |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9sKZ1rAO2BwC&amp;printsec=frontcover |isbn=0521791987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional arguments for incompatibilism are based on an "[[intuition pump]]": if a person is like other mechanical things that are determined in their behavior such as a wind-up toy, a billiard ball, a puppet, or a robot, then people must not have free will.&lt;ref name="Wagen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fischer | first1 = J.M. | year = 1983 | title = Incompatibilism | url = | journal = Philosophical Studies | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 121–37 | doi = 10.1007/BF01112527 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has been rejected by compatibilists such as Daniel Dennett on the grounds that, even if humans have something in common with these things, it remains possible and plausible that we are different from such objects in important ways.&lt;ref name="DD1"/&gt;

Another argument for incompatibilism is that of the "causal chain". Incompatibilism is key to the idealist theory of free will. Most incompatibilists reject the idea that freedom of action consists simply in "voluntary" behavior. They insist, rather, that free will means that man must be the "ultimate" or "originating" cause of his actions. He must be ''[[causa sui]]'', in the traditional phrase. Being responsible for one's choices is the first cause of those choices, where first cause means that there is no antecedent cause of that cause. The argument, then, is that if man has free will, then man is the ultimate cause of his actions. If determinism is true, then all of man's choices are caused by events and facts outside his control. So, if everything man does is caused by events and facts outside his control, then he cannot be the ultimate cause of his actions. Therefore, he cannot have free will.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, R. (1996) ''The Significance of Free Will'', Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-512656-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, C. A. (1957) ''On Selfhood and Godhood'', London: George Allen and Unwin. {{ISBN|0-415-29624-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, J. P. (1943) ''Being and Nothingness'', reprint 1993. New York: Washington Square Press. Sartre also provides a psychological version of the argument by claiming that if man's actions are not his own, he would be in ''bad faith''.&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has also been challenged by various compatibilist philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, R.M. (1994) ''The Metaphysics of Free Will'', Oxford:Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bok, H. (1998) ''Freedom and Responsibility'', Princeton:Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-01566-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third argument for incompatibilism was formulated by [[Carl Ginet]] in the 1960s and has received much attention in the modern literature. The simplified argument runs along these lines: if determinism is true, then we have no control over the events of the past that determined our present state and no control over the laws of nature. Since we can have no control over these matters, we also can have no control over the ''consequences'' of them. Since our present choices and acts, under determinism, are the necessary consequences of the past and the laws of nature, then we have no control over them and, hence, no free will. This is called the ''consequence argument''.&lt;ref&gt;Ginet, C. (1966) "Might We Have No Choice?" In Lehrer, 1966: 87–104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ving"&gt;Van Inwagen, P. and Zimmerman, D. (1998) ''Metaphysics: The Big Questions''. Oxford: Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; Peter van Inwagen remarks that C.D. Broad had a version of the consequence argument as early as the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Inwagen, P. (n.d.) [http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/HowThinkFW.doc "How to think about free will"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911064556/http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/HowThinkFW.doc |date=2008-09-11 }}, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The difficulty of this argument for some compatibilists lies in the fact that it entails the impossibility that one could have chosen other than one has. For example, if Jane is a compatibilist and she has just sat down on the sofa, then she is committed to the claim that she could have remained standing, if she had so desired. But it [[Logical consequence|follows from]] the consequence argument that, if Jane had remained standing, she would have either generated a contradiction, violated the laws of nature or changed the past. Hence, compatibilists are committed to the existence of "incredible abilities", according to Ginet and van Inwagen. One response to this argument is that it equivocates on the notions of abilities and necessities, or that the free will evoked to make any given choice is really an illusion and the choice had been made all along, oblivious to its "decider".&lt;ref name="Ving"/&gt; [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] suggests that compatibilists are only committed to the ability to do something otherwise if ''different circumstances'' had actually obtained in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1755-2567.1981.tb00473.x | last1 = Lewis | first1 = D. | year = 2008| title = Are We Free to Break the Laws? | url = | journal = Theoria | volume = 47 | issue = 3| pages = 113–21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using ''T'', ''F'' for "true" and "false" and ''?'' for undecided, there are exactly nine positions regarding determinism/free will that consist of any two of these three possibilities:&lt;ref name=Strawson&gt;

''Incompatibilism'' may occupy any of the nine positions except (5), (8) or (3), which last corresponds to ''soft determinism''. Position (1) is ''hard determinism'', and position (2) is ''libertarianism''. The position (1) of hard determinism adds to the table the contention that ''D'' implies ''FW'' is untrue, and the position (2) of libertarianism adds the contention that ''FW'' implies ''D'' is untrue. Position (9) may be called ''hard incompatibilism'' if one interprets ''?'' as meaning both concepts are of dubious value. ''Compatibilism'' itself may occupy any of the nine positions, that is, there is no logical contradiction between determinism and free will, and either or both may be true or false in principle. However, the most common meaning attached to ''compatibilism'' is that some form of determinism is true and yet we have some form of free will, position (3).&lt;ref name=FischerFour2009&gt;{{cite book |pages=44 ''ff'' |author= Fischer, John Martin |title=Four Views on Free Will (Great Debates in Philosophy) |isbn=1405134860 |year=2009 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |chapter=Chapter 2: Compatibilism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hard determinism====
{{main|Hard determinism}}
[[File:FreeWillTaxonomy4.svg|thumb|A simplified [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of philosophical positions regarding free will and determinism.]]

Determinism can be divided into causal, logical and theological determinism.&lt;ref name="Parkinson2012"&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia|author=G. H. R. Parkinson|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IqbJnEYKpW4C|accessdate=26 December 2012|date=12 October 2012|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-00323-0|title=determinism|pages=891–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corresponding to each of these different meanings, there arises a different problem for free will.&lt;ref name="Viv"&gt;Vihvelin, Kadri, "Arguments for Incompatibilism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2003 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2003/entries/incompatibilism-arguments/ ((online))]&lt;/ref&gt; Hard determinism is the claim that [[determinism]] is true, and that it is [[incompatibilism|incompatible with free will]], so free will does not exist. Although hard determinism generally refers to [[nomological determinism]] (see causal determinism below), it can include all forms of determinism that necessitate the future in its entirety.&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010 /&gt; Relevant forms of determinism include:
;[[Causal determinism]]: The idea that everything is caused by prior conditions, making it impossible for anything else to happen.&lt;ref name=stanfordmoralresponsibility /&gt; In its most common form, [[nomological determinism|nomological (or scientific) determinism]], future events are necessitated by past and present events combined with the laws of nature. Such determinism is sometimes illustrated by the [[thought experiment]] of [[Laplace's demon]]. Imagine an entity that knows all facts about the past and the present, and knows all natural laws that govern the universe. If the laws of nature were determinate, then such an entity would be able to use this knowledge to foresee the future, down to the smallest detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-4975.1993.tb00266.x | last1 = Suppes | first1 = P. | year = 1993 | title = The Transcendental Character of Determinism | url = | journal = Midwest Studies in Philosophy | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 242–57 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=determinism&gt;
The view of ''scientific determinism'' goes back to [[Pierre Simon Laplace|Laplace]]: "We ought to regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its antecedent state." For further discussion see {{cite book |title=The Philosophy of Science: An Encyclopedia. N–Z, Indeks, Volume 1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=od68ge7aF6wC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;lpg=PA197 |pages= 197 ''ff'' |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2006 |chapter=Determinism |isbn=0415939275 |editors=Sahotra Sarkar, Jessica Pfeifer, Justin Garson |author=John T Roberts}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Logical determinism]]: The notion that all [[proposition]]s, whether about the past, present or future, are either true or false. The problem of free will, in this context, is the problem of how choices can be free, given that what one does in the future is already determined as true or false in the present.&lt;ref name="Viv"/&gt;
;[[Theological determinism]]: The idea that the future is already determined, either by a [[creator deity]] decreeing or [[omniscience|knowing]] its outcome in advance.&lt;ref name = "FischerGod1989"&gt;Fischer, John Martin (1989) ''God, Foreknowledge and Freedom''.

London: Luzac &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of free will, in this context, is the problem of how our actions can be free if there is a being who has determined them for us in advance, or if they are already set in time.

Other forms of determinism are more relevant to compatibilism, such as [[biological determinism]], the idea that all behaviors, beliefs, and desires are fixed by our genetic endowment and our biochemical makeup, the latter of which is affected by both genes and environment, [[cultural determinism]] and [[psychological determinism]].&lt;ref name="Viv"/&gt; Combinations and syntheses of determinist theses, such as bio-environmental determinism, are even more common.

Suggestions have been made that hard determinism need not maintain strict determinism, where something near to, like that informally known as [[determinism|adequate determinism]], is perhaps more relevant.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismarguments&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Vihvelin |first=Kadri |editor=Edward N.

====Metaphysical libertarianism====
{{Main|Libertarianism (metaphysics)}}
[[File:FreewillConceptsBasedUponPhilosophyOfMindCausationViews.svg|thumb|Various definitions of free will that have been proposed for Metaphysical Libertarianism (agent/substance causal,&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories/&gt; centered accounts,&lt;ref name="Kane2005" /&gt; and efforts of will theory&lt;ref name="RKane1" /&gt;), along with examples of other common free will positions (Compatibilism,&lt;ref name="Velmans2002"/&gt; Hard Determinism,&lt;ref&gt;Paul Henri Thiry, Baron d'Holbach, ''System of Nature; or, the Laws of the Moral and Physical World'' (London, 1797), Vol. 1, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; and Hard Incompatibilism&lt;ref name="Derk1"/&gt;). Red circles represent mental states; blue circles represent physical states; arrows describe causal interaction.]]

[[libertarianism (metaphysics)|Metaphysical libertarianism]] is one philosophical view point under that of incompatibilism. Libertarianism holds onto a concept of free will that requires that the [[agency (philosophy)|agent]] be able to take more than one possible course of action under a given set of circumstances.

Accounts of libertarianism subdivide into non-physical theories and physical or naturalistic theories. Non-physical theories hold that the events in the brain that lead to the performance of actions do not have an entirely physical explanation, which requires that the world is not closed under physics. This includes [[interactionist dualism]], which claims that some non-physical [[mind]], will, or [[soul]] overrides physical [[causality]]. Physical determinism implies there is only one possible future and is therefore not compatible with libertarian free will. As consequent of incompatibilism, metaphysical libertarian explanations that do not involve dispensing with [[physicalism]] require physical indeterminism, such as probabilistic subatomic particle behavior&amp;nbsp;– theory unknown to many of the early writers on free will. Incompatibilist theories can be categorised based on the type of indeterminism they require; uncaused events, non-deterministically caused events, and agent/substance-caused events.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Randolph |first=Clarke |editor=Edward N. Zalta | title=Incompatibilist (Nondeterministic) Theories of Free Will | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| edition=Fall 2008 | year=2008 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/incompatibilism-theories}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-causal theories====
Non-causal accounts of incompatibilist free will do not require a free action to be caused by either an agent or a physical event. They either rely upon a world that is not causally closed, or physical indeterminism. Non-causal accounts often claim that each intentional action requires a choice or volition&amp;nbsp;– a willing, trying, or endeavoring on behalf of the agent (such as the cognitive component of lifting one's arm).&lt;ref name=LumerNannini2007&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christoph Lumer|author2=Sandro Nannini|title=Intentionality, Deliberation and Autonomy: The Action-Theoretic Basis of Practical Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4LzldxvSk4kC|accessdate=27 December 2012|date=30 November 2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-6058-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McCann1998&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh McCann|title=The Works of Agency: On Human Action, Will, and Freedom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a7HZT-MrFvwC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1998|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8583-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such intentional actions are interpreted as free actions. It has been suggested, however, that such acting cannot be said to exercise control over anything in particular. According to non-causal accounts, the causation by the agent cannot be analysed in terms of causation by mental states or events, including desire, belief, intention of something in particular, but rather is considered a matter of spontaneity and creativity. The exercise of intent in such intentional actions is not that which determines their freedom&amp;nbsp;– intentional actions are rather self-generating. The "actish feel" of some intentional actions do not "constitute that event's activeness, or the agent's exercise of active control", rather they "might be brought about by direct stimulation of someone's brain, in the absence of any relevant desire or intention on the part of that person".&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories /&gt; Another question raised by such non-causal theory, is how an agent acts upon reason, if the said intentional actions are spontaneous.

Some non-causal explanations involve invoking [[panpsychism]], the theory that a quality of [[mind]] is associated with all particles, and pervades the entire universe, in both animate and inanimate entities.

====Event-causal theories====

Event-causal accounts of incompatibilist free will typically rely upon physicalist models of mind (like those of the compatibilist), yet they presuppose physical indeterminism, in which certain indeterministic events are said to be caused by the agent. A number of event-causal accounts of free will have been created, referenced here as ''deliberative indeterminism'', ''centred accounts'', and ''efforts of will theory''.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories /&gt; The first two accounts do not require free will to be a fundamental constituent of the universe. Ordinary randomness is appealed to as supplying the "elbow room" that libertarians believe necessary. A first common objection to event-causal accounts is that the indeterminism could be destructive and could therefore diminish control by the agent rather than provide it (related to the problem of origination). A second common objection to these models is that it is questionable whether such indeterminism could add any value to deliberation over that which is already present in a deterministic world.

''Deliberative indeterminism'' asserts that the indeterminism is confined to an earlier stage in the decision process.&lt;ref name=Ekstrom2000&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Waddell Ekstrom|title=Free Will: A Philosophical Study|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oaOpa7qlz3kC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=2000|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-8133-9093-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mele2006&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfred R.

The selection process is deterministic, although it may be based on earlier preferences established by the same process. Deliberative indeterminism has been referenced by [[Daniel Dennett]]&lt;ref name="Dennett1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Clement Dennett|title=Brainstorms: Philosophical Essays on Mind and Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xwObaAZEwoC|accessdate=27 December 2012|date=13 July 1981|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-54037-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Martin Fischer]].&lt;ref name="L.

''Efforts of will theory'' is related to the role of will power in decision making. It suggests that the indeterminacy of agent volition processes could map to the indeterminacy of certain physical events&amp;nbsp;– and the outcomes of these events could therefore be considered caused by the agent. Models of [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] have been constructed in which it is seen as a particular kind of complex, high-level process with an element of physical indeterminism. An example of this approach is that of [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]], where he hypothesizes that "in each case, the indeterminism is functioning as a hindrance or obstacle to her realizing one of her purposes&amp;nbsp;– a hindrance or obstacle in the form of resistance within her will which must be overcome by effort."&lt;ref name="RKane1"&gt;{{Cite book| title=Four Views on Free Will (Libertarianism)| last=Kane| first=Robert|author2=John Martin Fischer |author3=Derk Pereboom |author4=Manuel Vargas | year=2007| publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Oxford UK| page=39| isbn=1-4051-3486-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Robert Kane such "ultimate responsibility" is a required condition for free will.&lt;ref name="Kane1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Kane|title=The Significance of Free Will|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hhuyeYKsWAkC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510550-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important factor in such a theory is that the agent cannot be reduced to physical neuronal events, but rather mental processes are said to provide an equally valid account of the determination of outcome as their physical processes (see [[non-reductive physicalism]]).

Although at the time [[quantum mechanics]] (and physical [[Quantum indeterminacy|indeterminism]]) was only in the initial stages of acceptance, in his book [[Miracles (book)|''Miracles: A preliminary study'']] C.S. Lewis stated the logical possibility that if the physical world were proved indeterministic this would provide an entry point to describe an action of a non-physical entity on physical reality.&lt;ref name="CSLewis1"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Lewis, C.S. | title=Miracles | year=1947| page=24| isbn=0-688-17369-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indeterminism|Indeterministic]] physical models (particularly those involving [[quantum indeterminacy]]) introduce random occurrences at an atomic or subatomic level. These events might affect brain activity, and could seemingly allow [[Incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] free will if the apparent indeterminacy of some mental processes (for instance, subjective perceptions of control in conscious [[Volition (psychology)|volition]]) map to the underlying indeterminacy of the physical construct. This relationship, however, requires a causative role over probabilities that is questionable,&lt;ref name=quantum&gt;{{cite book |title=Four Views on Free Will (Great Debates in Philosophy) |chapter=Libertarianism |author= Kane, Robert|page=9 |quote=It would seem that undetermined events in the brain or body would occur ''spontaneously'' and would be more likely to ''undermine'' our freedom rather than ''enhance'' it. |isbn=1405134860 |year=2007 |publisher= Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is far from established that brain activity responsible for human action can be affected by such events. Secondarily, these incompatibilist models are dependent upon the relationship between action and conscious volition, as studied in the [[neuroscience of free will]]. It is evident that observation may disturb the outcome of the observation itself, rendering limited our ability to identify causality.&lt;ref name=Bohr1&gt;{{cite web |author=Niels Bohr |title= The Atomic Theory and the Fundamental Principles underlying the Description of Nature; ''Based on a lecture to the Scandinavian Meeting of Natural Scientists and published in Danish in Fysisk Tidsskrift in 1929.

It is also required that the agent's causing of that event is not causally determined by prior events. A number of problems have been identified with this view. Firstly, it is difficult to establish the reason for any given choice by the agent, which suggests they may be random or determined by ''luck'' (without an underlying basis for the free will decision). Secondly, it has been questioned whether physical events can be caused by an external substance or mind&amp;nbsp;– a common problem associated with [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|interactionalist dualism]].

====Hard incompatibilism====
Hard incompatibilism is the idea that free will cannot exist, whether the world is deterministic or not. [[Derk Pereboom (philosopher)|Derk Pereboom]] has defended hard incompatibilism, identifying a variety of positions where free will is irrelevant to indeterminism/determinism, among them the following:
:#Determinism (D) is true, D does not imply we lack free will (F), but in fact we do lack F.
:#D is true, D does not imply we lack F, but in fact we don't know if we have F.
:#D is true, and we do have F.
:#D is true, we have F, and F implies D.
:#D is unproven, but we have F.
:#D isn't true, we do have F, and would have F even if D were true.
:#D isn't true, we don't have F, but F is compatible with D.
::::::Derk Pereboom, ''Living without Free Will'',&lt;ref name="Derk1"/&gt; p. xvi.
Pereboom calls positions 3 and 4 ''soft determinism'', position 1 a form of ''hard determinism'', position 6 a form of ''classical libertarianism'', and any position that includes having F as ''compatibilism''.

[[John Locke]] denied that the phrase "free will" made any sense (compare with [[theological noncognitivism]], a similar stance on the [[existence of God]]). He also took the view that the truth of determinism was irrelevant. He believed that the defining feature of voluntary behavior was that individuals have the ability to ''postpone'' a decision long enough to reflect or deliberate upon the consequences of a choice: "... the will in truth, signifies nothing but a power, or ability, to prefer or choose".&lt;ref&gt;Locke, J. (1689). ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding'' (1998, ed). Book II, Chap. XXI, Sec. 17. Penguin Classics, Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary philosopher [[Galen Strawson]] agrees with Locke that the truth or falsity of determinism is irrelevant to the
problem.&lt;ref name="GStraw"&gt;Strawson, G. (1998, 2004). "Free will". In E. Craig (ed.), ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. London: Routledge. Retrieved August 17, 2006, [http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014 ((online))] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825055350/http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014 |date=2007-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the notion of free will leads to an infinite regress and is therefore senseless.
According to Strawson, if one is responsible for what one does in a given situation, then one must be responsible for the way one is in certain mental respects. But it is impossible for one to be responsible for the way one is in any respect. This is because to be responsible in some situation ''S'', one must have been responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''. To be responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;'', one must have been responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;'', and so on. At some point in the chain, there must have been an act of origination of a new causal chain. But this is impossible. Man cannot create himself or his mental states ''[[ex nihilo]]''. This argument entails that free will itself is absurd, but not that it is incompatible with determinism. Strawson calls his own view "pessimism" but it can be classified as [[hard incompatibilism]].&lt;ref name="GStraw"/&gt;

=====High-level determinism and free will=====
======Causal determinism======
{{Main|Determinism}}

Causal determinism is the concept that [[Event (philosophy)|events]] within a given [[paradigm]] are bound by [[causality]] in such a way that any state (of an object or event) is completely determined by prior states. Causal determinism proposes that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrences stretching back to the origin of the universe. Causal determinists believe that there is nothing uncaused or [[Causa sui|self-caused]]. The most common form of causal determinism is nomological determinism (or scientific determinism), the notion that the past and the present dictate the future entirely and necessarily by rigid natural laws, that every occurrence results inevitably from prior events. [[Quantum mechanics]] poses a serious challenge to this view.

Fundamental debate continues over whether the physical universe is likely to be [[causal determinism|deterministic]]. Although the scientific method cannot be used to rule out [[indeterminism]] with respect to violations of [[causal closure]], it can be used to identify indeterminism in natural law. [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics]] at present are both [[deterministic system|deterministic]] and [[indeterminism|indeterministic]], and are being constrained by ongoing experimentation.&lt;ref name=GroblacherPaterek2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Groblacher|first1=Simon|last2=Paterek|first2=Tomasz|last3=Kaltenbaek|first3=Rainer|last4=Brukner|first4=Caslav|last5=Zukowski|first5=Marek|last6=Aspelmeyer|first6=Markus|last7=Zeilinger|first7=Anton|title=An experimental test of non-local realism|journal=Nature|volume=446|issue=7138|year=2007|pages=871–75|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/nature05677|pmid=17443179|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.2529|arxiv=0704.2529|bibcode=2007Natur.446..871G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Destiny and fate======
{{Main|Destiny}}

Destiny or fate is a predetermined course of events. It may be conceived as a predetermined future, whether in general or of an individual. It is a concept based on the belief that there is a fixed natural order to the cosmos.

Although often used interchangeably, the words "fate" and "destiny" have distinct connotations.

[[Fate]] generally implies there is a set course that cannot be deviated from, and over which one has no control. Fate is related to [[determinism]], but makes no specific claim of physical determinism. Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be fated externally (see for instance [[theological determinism]]). Destiny likewise is related to determinism, but makes no specific claim of physical determinism. Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be destined to occur.

[[Destiny]] implies there is a set course that cannot be deviated from, but does not of itself make any claim with respect to the setting of that course (i.e., it does not necessarily conflict with [[incompatibilist]] free will). Free will if existent could be the mechanism by which that destined outcome is chosen (determined to represent destiny).&lt;ref name="Blackwell2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben C. Blackwell|title=Christosis: Pauline Soteriology in Light of Deification in Irenaeus and Cyril of Alexandria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDZxSq9nx4IC|accessdate=8 December 2012|date=21 December 2011|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|isbn=978-3-16-151672-6|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Logical determinism======
{{See also|B-theory of time}}
Discussion regarding destiny does not necessitate the existence of supernatural powers. Logical [[determinism]] or determinateness is the notion that all propositions, whether about the past, present, or future, are either true or false. This creates a unique problem for free will given that propositions about the future already have a truth value in the present (that is it is already determined as either true or false), and is referred to as the [[problem of future contingents]].

======Omniscience======
{{Main|Omniscience}}

[[Omniscience]] is the capacity to know everything that there is to know (included in which are all future events), and is a property often attributed to a creator deity. Omniscience implies the existence of destiny. Some authors have claimed that free will cannot coexist with omniscience. One argument asserts that an omniscient creator not only implies destiny but a form of high level [[predeterminism]] such as hard [[theological determinism]] or [[predestination]]&amp;nbsp;– that they have independently fixed all events and outcomes in the universe in advance. In such a case, even if an individual could have influence over their lower level physical system, their choices in regard to this cannot be their own, as is the case with libertarian free will. Omniscience features as an [[incompatible-properties argument]] for the existence of [[God]], known as the [[argument from free will]], and is closely related to other such arguments, for example the incompatibility of [[omnipotence]] with a good creator deity (i.e. if a deity knew what they were going to choose, then they are responsible for letting them choose it).

=====Predeterminism=====

[[Predeterminism]] is the idea that all events are determined in advance.&lt;ref name="McKewan"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=McKewan |first=Jaclyn |editor=H.

Predeterminism is frequently taken to mean that human actions cannot interfere with (or have no bearing on) the outcomes of a pre-determined course of events, and that one's destiny was established externally (for example, exclusively by a creator deity). The concept of predeterminism is often argued by invoking [[causal determinism]], implying that there is an unbroken [[chain of prior occurrences]] stretching back to the origin of the universe. In the case of predeterminism, this chain of events has been pre-established, and human actions cannot interfere with the outcomes of this pre-established chain. Predeterminism can be used to mean such pre-established causal determinism, in which case it is categorised as a specific type of [[determinism]].&lt;ref name="McKewan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/notes-determinism.html |title=Some Varieties of Free Will and Determinism |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=10 September 2009 &lt;!-- date found by checking page's source code where format of date given as m.d.y --&gt;|work=Philosophy 302: Ethics |publisher=philosophy.lander.edu |accessdate=19 December 2012| quote=Predeterminism: the philosophical and theological view that combines God with determinism.

The term predeterminism suggests not just a determining of all events, but the prior and deliberately conscious determining of all events (therefore done, presumably, by a conscious being). While determinism usually refers to a naturalistically explainable causality of events, predeterminism seems by definition to suggest a person or a "someone" who is controlling or planning the causality of events before they occur and who then perhaps resides beyond the natural, causal universe. [[Predestination]] asserts that a supremely powerful being has indeed fixed all events and outcomes in the universe in advance, and is a famous doctrine of the [[Calvinists]] in [[Christian]] theology. Predestination is often considered a form of hard [[theological determinism]].

Predeterminism has therefore been compared to [[fatalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sherman, H. |title=Marx and determinism |quote=Many religions of the world have considered that the path of history is predetermined by God or Fate. On this basis, many believe that what will happen will happen, and they accept their destiny with fatalism. |journal=Journal of Economic Issues |pages=61–71 |year=1981 |jstor=4224996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fatalism is the idea that everything is fated to happen, so that humans have no control over their future.

====Theological determinism====

{{Main|Theological determinism}}

[[Theological determinism]] is a form of [[determinism]] stating that all events that happen are pre-ordained, or [[predestination|predestined]] to happen, by a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[deity]], or that they are destined to occur given its [[omniscience]]. Two forms of theological determinism exist, here referenced as strong and weak theological determinism.&lt;ref name=JordanTate2004&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anne Lockyer Jordan|author2=Anne Lockyer Jordan Neil Lockyer Edwin Tate|author3=Neil Lockyer|author4=Edwin Tate|title=Philosophy of Religion for A Level OCR Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uBVuNip8qjkC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=25 June 2004|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=978-0-7487-8078-5|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first one, strong theological determinism, is based on the concept of a [[creator deity]] dictating all events in history: "everything that happens has been predestined to happen by an omniscient, omnipotent divinity."&lt;ref name=Iannone2001&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Pabl Iannone|title=Dictionary of World Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7wBmBO3vpE4C|accessdate=22 December 2012|year=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-17995-9|page=194|chapter=determinism}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The second form, weak theological determinism, is based on the concept of divine foreknowledge&amp;nbsp;– "because [[God]]'s omniscience is perfect, what God knows about the future will inevitably happen, which means, consequently, that the future is already fixed."&lt;ref name=Huyssteen2003&gt;{{cite book|author=Wentzel Van Huyssteen|title=Encyclopedia of science and religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HIcYAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=22 December 2012|volume=1|year=2003|publisher=Macmillan Reference|isbn=978-0-02-865705-9|page=217|chapter=theological determinism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There exist slight variations on the above categorisation. Some claim that theological determinism requires [[predestination]] of all events and outcomes by the divinity (that is, they do not classify the weaker version as 'theological determinism' unless libertarian free will is assumed to be denied as a consequence), or that the weaker version does not constitute 'theological determinism' at all.&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010&gt;{{cite book|author=Raymond J. VanArragon|title=Key Terms in Philosophy of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JyTohO1AMzwC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=21 October 2010|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4411-3867-5|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theological determinism can also be seen as a form of [[causal determinism]], in which the antecedent conditions are the nature and will of God.&lt;ref name=stanfordmoralresponsibility&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Eshleman |first=Andrew |editor=Edward N. Zalta | title=Moral Responsibility | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| edition=Winter 2009 | year=2009 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2010/entries/determinism-causal}}&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to free will and the classification of theological compatibilism/incompatibilism below, "theological determinism is the thesis that God exists and has infallible knowledge of all true propositions including propositions about our future actions," more minimal criteria designed to encapsulate all forms of theological determinism.&lt;ref name="stanfordincompatibilismarguments"/&gt;

[[File:TheologicalDeterminismXFreeWill.svg|thumb|A simplified [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of philosophical positions regarding free will and theological determinism.&lt;ref name="stanfordforeknowledge" /&gt;]]
There are various implications for [[metaphysical libertarianism|metaphysical libertarian]] free will as consequent of theological determinism and its philosophical interpretation.
* Strong theological determinism is not compatible with metaphysical libertarian free will, and is a form of ''hard theological determinism'' (equivalent to theological fatalism below). It claims that free will does not exist, and ''God'' has absolute control over a person's actions. Hard theological determinism is similar in implication to [[hard determinism]], although it does not invalidate [[compatibilism|compatibilist]] free will.&lt;ref name=stanfordforeknowledge /&gt; Hard theological determinism is a form of theological incompatibilism (see figure, top left).
* Weak theological determinism is either compatible or incompatible with metaphysical libertarian free will depending upon one's philosophical interpretation of [[omniscience]]&amp;nbsp;– and as such is interpreted as either a form of hard theological determinism (known as [[theological fatalism]]), or as ''soft theological determinism'' (terminology used for clarity only). Soft theological determinism claims that humans have free will to choose their actions, holding that God, while [[omniscience|knowing their actions before they happen]], does not affect the outcome. God's providence is "compatible" with voluntary choice. Soft theological determinism is known as theological compatibilism (see figure, top right). A rejection of theological determinism (or [[omniscience|divine foreknowledge]]) is classified as theological incompatibilism also (see figure, bottom), and is relevant to a more general discussion of free will.&lt;ref name="stanfordforeknowledge"/&gt;

The basic argument for theological fatalism in the case of weak theological determinism is as follows:
# Assume divine foreknowledge or [[omniscience]]
# [[infallibility|Infallible]] foreknowledge implies destiny (it is known for certain what one will do)
# Destiny eliminates alternate possibility (one cannot do otherwise)
# Assert incompatibility with metaphysical libertarian free will

This argument is very often accepted as a basis for theological incompatibilism: denying either libertarian free will or divine foreknowledge (omniscience) and therefore theological determinism. On the other hand, theological compatibilism must attempt to find problems with it. The formal version of the argument rests on a number of premises, many of which have received some degree of contention. Theological compatibilist responses have included:
* Deny the truth value of [[Problem of future contingents|future contingents]], as proposed for example by [[Aristotle]] (although this denies foreknowledge and therefore theological determinism).
* Assert differences in non-temporal knowledge (space-time independence), an approach taken for example by [[Boethius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Boethius | title=The Consolation of Philosophy | chapter=Book V, Prose vi}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Aquinas, St. Thomas | title=Summa Theologica | chapter=Ia, q. 14, art 13.}} See [[Summa Theologica]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[C.S. Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=C.S. Lewis | title=Mere Christianity | publisher=Touchstone:New York | year=1980 | page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Deny the Principle of [[Alternative Possibilities|Alternate Possibilities]]: "If you cannot do otherwise when you do an act, you do not act freely." For example, a human observer could in principle have a machine that could detect what will happen in the future, but the existence of this machine or their use of it has no influence on the outcomes of events.&lt;ref name=zagzebski1991&gt;{{cite book|author=Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski|title=The Dilemma of Freedom and Foreknowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0v9nLMBtGYcC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=25 April 1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510763-0|chapter=chapter 6, section 2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the definition of [[compatibilism]] and [[incompatibilism]], the literature often fails to distinguish between physical determinism and higher level forms of determinism (predeterminism, theological determinism, etc.) As such, hard determinism with respect to theological determinism (or "Hard Theological Determinism" above) might be classified as hard incompatibilism with respect to physical determinism (if no claim was made regarding the internal causality or determinism of the universe), or even compatibilism (if freedom from the constraint of determinism was not considered necessary for free will), if not hard determinism itself. By the same principle, metaphysical libertarianism (a form of incompatibilism with respect to physical determinism) might be classified as compatibilism with respect to theological determinism (if it was assumed such free will events were pre-ordained and therefore were destined to occur, but of which whose outcomes were not "predestined" or determined by God). If hard theological determinism is accepted (if it was assumed instead that such outcomes were predestined by God), then metaphysical libertarianism is not, however, possible, and would require reclassification (as hard incompatibilism for example, given that the universe is still assumed to be indeterministic&amp;nbsp;– although the classification of hard determinism is technically valid also).&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010 /&gt;

=====Mind-body problem=====

{{See also|Philosophy of mind|Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Monism|Physicalism}}
[[File:Frans Hals - Portret van René Descartes.jpg|thumb|upright|[[René Descartes]]]]

The idea of ''free will'' is one aspect of the [[Mind–body problem|mind-body problem]], that is, consideration of the relation between [[mind]] (for example, consciousness, memory, and judgment) and body (for example, the [[human brain]] and [[nervous system]]). [[Philosophy of Mind|Philosophical models of mind]] are divided into [[Physicalism|physical]] and non-physical expositions.

[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Substance dualism|Cartesian dualism]] holds that the mind is a nonphysical substance, the seat of consciousness and intelligence, and is not identical with physical states of the brain or body. It is suggested that although the two worlds do interact, each retains some measure of autonomy. Under cartesian dualism external mind is responsible for bodily action, although unconscious brain activity is often caused by external events (for example, the instantaneous reaction to being burned).&lt;ref name=Peruzzi&gt;See for example: {{cite book |title=Mind and Causality |chapter=Chapter 5: Mental causation and intentionality in a mind naturalizing theory |author=Sandro Nannini |editor=Alberto Peruzzi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zYEPifPTQK4C&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA77 |pages=69 ''ff'' |isbn=1588114759 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartesian dualism implies that the physical world is not deterministic&amp;nbsp;– and in which external mind controls (at least some) physical events, providing an interpretation of [[incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] free will. Stemming from Cartesian dualism, a formulation sometimes called ''[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Interactionism|interactionalist dualism]]'' suggests a two-way interaction, that some physical events cause some mental acts and some mental acts cause some physical events. One modern vision of the possible separation of mind and body is the [[Popper's three worlds|"three-world" formulation]] of [[Karl Popper|Popper]].&lt;ref name=Popper&gt;{{cite book |title=All Life is Problem Solving |chapter=Notes of a realist on the body-mind problem |author=Karl Raimund Popper |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pa3cZYwdq28C&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23 |pages=23 ''ff'' |isbn=0415174864 |year=1999 |publisher=Psychology Press |quote=The body-mind relationship...includes the problem of man's position in the physical world...'World 1'. The world of conscious human processes I shall call 'World 2', and the world of the objective creations of the human mind I shall call 'World 3'. |edition=A lecture given in Mannheim, 8 May 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartesian dualism and Popper's three worlds are two forms of what is called [[epistemological pluralism]], that is the notion that different epistemological methodologies are necessary to attain a full description of the world. Other forms of epistemological pluralist dualism include [[psychophysical parallelism]] and [[epiphenomenalism]]. Epistemological pluralism is one view in which the mind-body problem is ''not'' reducible to the concepts of the natural sciences.

A contrasting approach is called [[physicalism]]. Physicalism is a [[philosophical theory]] holding that everything that [[existence|exists]] is no more extensive than its [[physical properties]]; that is, that there are no non-physical substances (for example physically independent minds). Physicalism can be reductive or non-reductive. [[Reductive physicalism]] is grounded in the idea that everything in the world can actually be reduced analytically to its fundamental physical, or material, basis. Alternatively, [[non-reductive physicalism]] asserts that mental properties form a separate ontological class to physical properties: that mental states (such as [[qualia]]) are not ontologically reducible to physical states. Although one might suppose that mental states and neurological states are different in kind, that does not rule out the possibility that mental states are correlated with neurological states. In one such construction, [[anomalous monism]], mental events [[Supervenience|''supervene'']] on physical events, describing the [[emergence]] of mental properties correlated with physical properties&amp;nbsp;– implying causal reducibility. Non-reductive physicalism is therefore often categorised as [[property dualism]] rather than [[monism]], yet other types of property dualism do not adhere to the causal reducibility of mental states (see epiphenomenalism).

[[Incompatibilism]] requires a distinction between the mental and the physical, being a commentary on the incompatibility of (determined) physical reality and one's presumably distinct experience of will. Secondarily, [[metaphysical libertarianism|metaphysical libertarian]] free will must assert influence on physical reality, and where mind is responsible for such influence (as opposed to ordinary system randomness), it must be distinct from body to accomplish this. Both substance and property dualism offer such a distinction, and those particular models thereof that are not causally inert with respect to the physical world provide a basis for illustrating incompatibilist free will (i.e. interactionalist dualism and non-reductive physicalism).

It has been noted that the [[Physical law|laws of physics]] have yet to resolve the [[hard problem of consciousness]]:&lt;ref name=Kalat&gt;

===Compatibilism===
{{Main|Compatibilism}}
[[File:Thomas Hobbes (portrait).jpg|upright|thumb|[[Thomas Hobbes]] was a classical compatibilist.]]

Compatibilists maintain that determinism is compatible with free will. They believe freedom can be present or absent in a situation for reasons that have nothing to do with metaphysics. For instance, [[courts of law]] make judgments about whether individuals are acting under their own free will under certain circumstances without bringing in metaphysics. Similarly, [[political liberty]] is a non-metaphysical concept.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Likewise, some compatibilists define free will as freedom to act according to one's determined motives without hindrance from other individuals. So for example Aristotle in his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Susan Sauve Meyer, ''Aristotle on Moral Responsibility.'', Oxford 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and the Stoic Chrysippus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susanne Bobzien|Bobzien, Susanne]], ''Freedom and Determinism in Stoic Philosophy'', Oxford 1998, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast, the [[incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] positions are concerned with a sort of "metaphysically free will", which compatibilists claim has never been coherently defined. Compatibilists argue that determinism does not matter; though they disagree among themselves about what, in turn, ''does'' matter. To be a compatibilist, one need not endorse any particular conception of free will, but only deny that determinism is at odds with free will.&lt;ref name="CompSEP"&gt;McKenna, Michael, "Compatibilism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2004 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.),[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2004/entries/compatibilism/ ((online))]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are various impediments to exercising one's choices, free will does not imply freedom of action. Freedom of choice (freedom to select one's will) is logically separate from freedom to ''implement'' that choice (freedom to enact one's will), although not all writers observe this distinction.&lt;ref name="OConnor"/&gt; Nonetheless, some philosophers have defined free will as the absence of various impediments. Some "modern compatibilists", such as [[Harry Frankfurt]] and [[Daniel Dennett]], argue free will is simply freely choosing to do what constraints allow one to do. In other words, a coerced agent's choices can still be free if such coercion coincides with the agent's personal intentions and desires.&lt;ref name="DD1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett, D. |year=1984 |title= Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting |publisher= Bradford Books |isbn=0-262-54042-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P4NtNzOKxycC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Frankfurt&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.2307/2024717 | last1=Frankfurt |first1= H. | year=1971 | pages=5–20 |title= Freedom of the Will and the Concept of the Person | issue=1 | volume=68 |journal=Journal of Philosophy |jstor= 2024717 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as lack of physical restraint====
Most "classical compatibilists", such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], claim that a person is acting on the person's own will only when it is the desire of that person to do the act, and also possible for the person to be able to do otherwise, ''if the person had decided to''. Hobbes sometimes attributes such compatibilist freedom to each individual and not to some abstract notion of ''will'', asserting, for example, that "no liberty can be inferred to the will, desire, or inclination, but the liberty of the man; which consisteth in this, that he finds no stop, in doing what he has the will, desire, or inclination to doe{{sic}}&lt;!-- sic, that is how Hobbes wrote it; don't change to "do". --&gt;."&lt;ref name="Hobbes"&gt;Hobbes, T. (1651) ''Leviathan'' [http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=585&amp;search=%22finds+no+stop%22&amp;chapter=89860&amp;layout=html#a_2025807 Chapter XXI.: "Of the liberty of subjects"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511122711/http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=585&amp;search=%22finds+no+stop%22&amp;chapter=89860&amp;layout=html |date=2011-05-11 }} (1968 edition). London: Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt; In articulating this crucial proviso, [[David Hume]] writes, "this hypothetical liberty is universally allowed to belong to every one who is not a prisoner and in chains."&lt;ref name="Hume"&gt;Hume, D. (1740). ''A Treatise of Human Nature'' Section VIII.: "[http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=341&amp;search=%22prisoner+chains%22&amp;chapter=61966&amp;layout=html#a_606067 Of liberty and necessity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511122708/http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=341&amp;search=%22prisoner+chains%22&amp;chapter=61966&amp;layout=html |date=2011-05-11 }}" (1967 edition). [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford. {{ISBN|0-87220-230-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Voltaire]], in his ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique]]'', claimed that "Liberty then is only and can be only the power to do what one will." He asked, "would you have everything at the pleasure of a million blind caprices?" For him, free will or liberty is "only the power of acting, what is this power? It is the effect of the constitution and present state of our organs."

====Free will as a psychological state====
Compatibilism often regards the agent free as virtue of their reason. Some explanations of free will focus on the internal causality of the mind with respect to higher-order brain processing&amp;nbsp;– the interaction between conscious and unconscious brain activity.&lt;ref name=Baumeister&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford Handbook of Human Action |chapter=Chapter 23: Free Willpower: A limited resource theory of volition, choice and self-regulation |author1=Roy F Baumeister |author2=Matthew T Galliot |author3=Dianne M Tice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFP1AZYlNmcC&amp;pg=PA487&amp;lpg=PA487 |pages=487 ''ff'' |editor1=Ezequiel Morsella |editor2=John A.

{{cite book |title=Oxford Handbook of Human Action |chapter=Chapter 23: Free Willpower: A limited resource theory of volition, choice and self-regulation |author1=Roy F Baumeister |author2=Matthew T Galliot |author3=Dianne M Tice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFP1AZYlNmcC&amp;pg=PA487&amp;lpg=PA487 |pages= 487 ''ff'' |editors=Ezequiel Morsella, John A.

Our findings suggest that the traditional folk notions of willpower and character strength have some legitimate basis in genuine phenomena.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Compatibilist free will has also been attributed to our natural [[sense of agency]], where one must believe they are an agent in order to function and develop a [[theory of mind]].&lt;ref name="Smilansky2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Saul Smilansky|title=Free Will and Illusion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPUTQq7CUfwC|accessdate=6 February 2013|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-825018-0|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gallagher | first1 = S. | year = 2000 | title = Philosophical conceptions of the self: implications for cognitive science | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 14–21 | doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(99)01417-5| pmid = 10637618 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of levels of decision is presented in a different manner by Frankfurt.&lt;ref name=Frankfurt/&gt; Frankfurt argues for a version of compatibilism called the "hierarchical mesh". The idea is that an individual can have conflicting desires at a first-order level and also have a desire about the various first-order desires (a second-order desire) to the effect that one of the desires prevails over the others. A person's will is identified with their effective first-order desire, that is, the one they act on, and this will is free if it was the desire the person wanted to act upon, that is, the person's second-order desire was effective. So, for example, there are "wanton addicts", "unwilling addicts" and "willing addicts". All three groups may have the conflicting first-order desires to want to take the drug they are addicted to and to not want to take it.

The first group, ''wanton addicts'', have no second-order desire not to take the drug. The second group, "unwilling addicts", have a second-order desire not to take the drug, while the third group, "willing addicts", have a second-order desire to take it. According to Frankfurt, the members of the first group are devoid of will and therefore are no longer persons. The members of the second group freely desire not to take the drug, but their will is overcome by the addiction. Finally, the members of the third group willingly take the drug they are addicted to. Frankfurt's theory can ramify to any number of levels. Critics of the theory point out that there is no certainty that conflicts will not arise even at the higher-order levels of desire and preference.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, D. (1982). ''Free Will''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that Frankfurt offers no adequate explanation of how the various levels in the hierarchy mesh together.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, John Martin, and Mark Ravizza. (1998). ''Responsibility and Control: An Essay on Moral Responsibility''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as unpredictability====
In ''[[Elbow Room (book)|Elbow Room]]'', Dennett presents an argument for a compatibilist theory of free will, which he further elaborated in the book ''[[Freedom Evolves]]''.&lt;ref name="DD2"&gt;Dennett, D. (2003) ''Freedom Evolves''. Viking Books. {{ISBN|0-670-03186-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic reasoning is that, if one excludes God, an infinitely powerful [[demon]], and other such possibilities, then because of [[chaos theory|chaos]] and epistemic limits on the precision of our knowledge of the current state of the world, the future is ill-defined for all finite beings. The only well-defined things are "expectations". The ability to do "otherwise" only makes sense when dealing with these expectations, and not with some unknown and unknowable future.

According to Dennett, because individuals have the ability to act differently from what anyone expects, free will can exist.&lt;ref name="DD2"/&gt; Incompatibilists claim the problem with this idea is that we may be mere "automata responding in predictable ways to stimuli in our environment". Therefore, all of our actions are controlled by forces outside ourselves, or by random chance.&lt;ref name="Kaney"&gt;Kane, R. ''The Oxford Handbook to Free Will''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-513336-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More sophisticated analyses of compatibilist free will have been offered, as have other critiques.&lt;ref name="CompSEP"/&gt;

In the philosophy of [[decision theory]], a fundamental question is: From the standpoint of statistical outcomes, to what extent do the choices of a conscious being have the ability to influence the future? [[Newcomb's paradox]] and other philosophical problems pose questions about free will and predictable outcomes of choices.

====The physical mind====
{{See also|Neuroscience of free will}}

[[Compatibilist]] models of free will often consider deterministic relationships as discoverable in the physical world (including the brain). Cognitive [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]&lt;ref name=naturalism&gt;A key exponent of this view was [[Willard van Orman Quine]]. See {{cite web |title=Willard van Orman Quine |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/quine/ |author=Hylton, Peter |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2010 Edition) |editor= Edward N. Zalta |date=Apr 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[physicalism|physicalist]] approach to studying human [[cognition]] and [[consciousness]] in which the mind is simply part of nature, perhaps merely a feature of many very complex self-programming feedback systems (for example, [[neural networks]] and [[Cognitive robotics|cognitive robots]]), and so must be studied by the methods of empirical science, such as the [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral]] and [[cognitive science]]s (''i.e.'' [[neuroscience]] and [[cognitive psychology]]).&lt;ref name=Peruzzi/&gt;&lt;ref name=physicalism&gt;

A thoughtful list of careful distinctions regarding the application of empirical science to these issues is found in {{cite web |author=Stoljar, Daniel |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2009/entries/physicalism/#12 |title=Physicalism: §12 – Physicalism and the physicalist world picture |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2009 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |date=Sep 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive naturalism stresses the role of neurological sciences. Overall brain health, [[substance dependence]], [[Long-term depression|depression]], and various [[personality disorders]] clearly influence mental activity, and their impact upon [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] is also important.&lt;ref name=Baumeister /&gt; For example, an [[substance abuse|addict]] may experience a conscious desire to escape addiction, but be unable to do so. The "will" is disconnected from the freedom to act. This situation is related to an abnormal production and distribution of [[dopamine]] in the brain.&lt;ref name=Volkow&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The neuroscience of free will places restrictions on both compatibilist and incompatibilist free will conceptions.

Compatibilist models adhere to models of mind in which mental activity (such as deliberation) can be reduced to physical activity without any change in physical outcome. Although compatibilism is generally aligned to (or is at least compatible with) physicalism, some compatibilist models describe the natural occurrences of deterministic deliberation in the brain in terms of the first person perspective of the conscious agent performing the deliberation.&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt; Such an approach has been considered a form of identity dualism. A description of "how conscious experience might affect brains" has been provided in which "the experience of conscious free will is the first-person perspective of the neural correlates of choosing."&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt;

Recently{{when|date=August 2018}} [[Claudio Costa (philosopher)|Claudio Costa]] developed a neocompatibilist theory based on the causal theory of action that is complementary to classical compatibilism. According to him, physical, psychological and rational restrictions can interfer at different levels of the causal chain that would naturally lead to action. Corrrespondingly, there can be physical restrictions to the body, psychological restrictions to the decision, and rational restrictions to the formation of reasons (desires plus beliefs) that should lead to what we would call a reasonable action. The last two are usually called "restrictions of free will". The restriction at the level of reasons is particularly important, since it can be motivated by external reasons that are insufficiently conscious to the agent. One example was the collective suicide led by [[Jim Jones]]. The suicidal agents were not conscious that their free will have been manipulated by external, even if ungrounded, reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Claudio Costa [http://www.example''Lines of Thought: Rethinking Philosophical Assumptions''] CSP, 2014, Ch. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other views===
Some philosophers' views are difficult to categorize as either compatibilist or incompatibilist, hard determinist or libertarian. For example, [[Ted Honderich]] holds the view that "determinism is true, compatibilism and incompatibilism are both false" and the real problem lies elsewhere. Honderich maintains that determinism is true because quantum phenomena are not events or things that can be located in space and time, but are [[Abstract object|abstract]] entities. Further, even if they were micro-level events, they do not seem to have any relevance to how the world is at the macroscopic level. He maintains that incompatibilism is false because, even if indeterminism is true, incompatibilists have not provided, and cannot provide, an adequate account of origination. He rejects compatibilism because it, like incompatibilism, assumes a single, fundamental notion of freedom. There are really two notions of freedom: voluntary action and origination. Both notions are required to explain freedom of will and responsibility. Both determinism and indeterminism are threats to such freedom. To abandon these notions of freedom would be to abandon moral responsibility. On the one side, we have our intuitions; on the other, the scientific facts. The "new" problem is how to resolve this conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Honderich, T. (2001). "Determinism as True, Compatibilism and Incompatibilism as Both False and the Real Problem" in ''The Free Will Handbook'', edited by Robert Kane of the University of Texas.

====Free will as an illusion====
[[File:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|upright|Spinoza thought that there is no free will.]]
:"Experience teaches us no less clearly than reason, that men believe themselves free, simply because they are conscious of their actions, and unconscious of the causes whereby those actions are determined." [[Baruch Spinoza]], ''Ethics''&lt;ref name=Spinoza&gt;{{cite book |author= Benedict de Spinoza |year=2008 |chapter= Part III: On the origin and nature of the emotions; Postulates (Proposition II, Note) |editor= R.H.M.

David Hume discussed the possibility that the entire debate about free will is nothing more than a merely "verbal" issue. He suggested that it might be accounted for by "a false sensation or seeming experience" (a ''velleity''), which is associated with many of our actions when we perform them. On reflection, we realize that they were necessary and determined all along.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D. (1765). ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', Indianapolis: Hacket Publishing Co. Second edition. 1993. {{ISBN|0-87220-230-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schopenhauer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] claimed that phenomena have no free will but the will as [[Noumena|noumenon]], is free.]]
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] put the puzzle of free will and moral responsibility in these terms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone believes himself, ''a priori'', perfectly free&amp;nbsp;– even in his individual actions, and thinks that at every moment he can commence another manner of life. ... But ''a posteriori'', through experience, he finds to his astonishment that he is not free, but subjected to necessity, that in spite of all his resolutions and reflections he does not change his conduct, and that from the beginning of his life to the end of it, he must carry out the very character which he himself condemns...&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur, ''The Wisdom of Life'', p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In his essay ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', Schopenhauer stated, "You can do what you will, but in any given moment of your life you can ''will'' only one definite thing and absolutely nothing other than that one thing."&lt;ref&gt;[[Schopenhauer]], Arthur, ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', Oxford: Basil Blackwell {{ISBN|0-631-14552-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schopenhauer, [[phenomena]] do not have free will. However, [[Will (philosophy)|will]] [urging, craving, striving, wanting, and desiring] as [[Noumena|noumenon]] is free.

====Free will as "moral imagination"====
[[Rudolf Steiner]], who collaborated in a complete edition of Arthur Schopenhauer's work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arthur Schopenhauers sämtliche Werke in zwölf Bänden. Mit Einleitung von Dr. Rudolf Steiner, Stuttgart: Verlag der J.G. Cotta'schen Buchhandlung Nachfolger, o.J. (1894–96)|first=Rudolf|last=Steiner|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~kafka/k_s_bibII.html |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote ''The [[Philosophy of Freedom]]'', which focuses on the problem of free will. Steiner (1861–1925) initially divides this into the two aspects of freedom: ''freedom of thought'' and ''freedom of action''. The controllable and uncontrollable aspects of decision making thereby are made logically separable, as pointed out in the introduction. This separation of ''will'' from ''action'' has a very long history, going back at least as far as [[Stoicism]] and the teachings of [[Chrysippus]] (279–206 BCE), who separated external ''antecedent'' causes from the internal disposition receiving this cause.&lt;ref name=Chrysippus&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9lRD6feR3hEC&amp;pg=PA529 |page=529 |chapter=Chapter VI: The Chyrsippean notion of fate: soft determinism |author=Keimpe Algra |isbn=0521250285 |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner then argues that inner freedom is achieved when we integrate our sensory impressions, which reflect the outer appearance of the world, with our thoughts, which lend coherence to these impressions and thereby disclose to us an understandable world. Acknowledging the many influences on our choices, he nevertheless point out that they do not preclude freedom unless we fail to recognise them. Steiner argues that outer freedom is attained by permeating our deeds with ''moral imagination.” “Moral” in this case refers to action that is willed, while “imagination” refers to the mental capacity to envision conditions that do not already hold. Both of these functions are necessarily conditions for freedom. Steiner aims to show that these two aspects of inner and outer freedom are integral to one another, and that true freedom is only achieved when they are united.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, R. (1964). Rudolf Steiner Press, London, 1964, 1970, 1972, 1979, 230 pp., translated from the 12th German edition of 1962 by Michael Wilson. [http://www.rsarchive.org/Books/GA004/ ((online))]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as a pragmatically useful concept====
[[William James]]' views were ambivalent. While he believed in free will on "ethical grounds", he did not believe that there was evidence for it on scientific grounds, nor did his own introspections support it.&lt;ref&gt;See Bricklin, Jonathan, "A Variety of Religious Experience: William James and the Non-Reality of Free Will", in Libet (1999), ''The Volitional Brain: Toward a Neuroscience of Free Will'' (Thorverton UK: Imprint Academic).&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately he believed that the problem of free will was a metaphysical issue and, therefore, could not be settled by science. Moreover, he did not accept incompatibilism as formulated below; he did not believe that the indeterminism of human actions was a prerequisite of moral responsibility. In his work ''[[Pragmatism]]'', he wrote that "instinct and utility between them can safely be trusted to carry on the social business of punishment and praise" regardless of metaphysical theories.&lt;ref name="JW"&gt;James, W. (1907) ''Pragmatism'' (1979 edition). Cambridge, MA: [[Harvard University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; He did believe that indeterminism is important as a "doctrine of relief"&amp;nbsp;– it allows for the view that, although the world may be in many respects a bad place, it may, through individuals' actions, become a better one. Determinism, he argued, undermines [[meliorism]]&amp;nbsp;– the idea that progress is a real concept leading to improvement in the world.&lt;ref name="JW"/&gt;

====Free will and views of causality====
{{See also|Principle of sufficient reason}}

In 1739, [[David Hume]] in his ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' approached free will via the notion of causality. It was his position that causality was a mental construct used to explain the repeated association of events, and that one must examine more closely the relation between things ''regularly succeeding'' one another (descriptions of regularity in nature) and things that ''result'' in other things (things that cause or necessitate other things).&lt;ref name=Kane&gt;
{{cite book |title=The significance of free will |author=Robert Kane |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dBlXH3FtwJIC&amp;pg=PA226 |page= 226 |chapter=Notes to pages 74–81, note 22 |isbn=0195126564 |year=1998 |edition=Paperback}}
&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hume, 'causation' is on weak grounds: "Once we realise that 'A must bring about B' is tantamount merely to 'Due to their constant conjunction, we are psychologically certain that B will follow A,' then we are left with a very weak notion of necessity."&lt;ref name=Lorkowski&gt;{{cite web |author=CM Lorkowski |date=November 7, 2010 |title=David Hume: Causation |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hume-cau/ |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This empiricist view was often denied by trying to prove the so-called [[apriority]] of causal law (i.e. that it precedes all experience and is rooted in the construction of the perceivable world):
* [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s proof in ''Critique of Pure Reason'' (which referenced time and time ordering of causes and effects)&lt;ref&gt;Kant argued that, in order that human life is not just a "dream" (a random or projected by subjects juxtaposition of moments), the temporality of event A as before or after B must submit to a rule. An established order then implies the existence of some necessary conditions and causes, that is: sufficient bases (a so-called sufficient reason is the coincidence of all the necessary conditions). Without established causality, both [[Transcendental apperception|in subject]] and in the external world, the passing of time would be impossible, because it is essentially directional. See [[s:Critique of Pure Reason/Volume 1/Division 1#B. SECOND ANALOGY. Principle of the Succession of Time According to the Law of Causality. All changes take place according to the law of the connection of Cause and Effect.|online text of his proof]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s proof from ''The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason'' (which referenced the so-called intellectuality of representations, that is, in other words, objects and [[qualia]] perceived with senses)&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, who by the way continued and simplified Kant's system, argued (among others basing on optical illusions and the "initial processing") that it is the intellect or even the brain what generates the image of the world out of something else, by ''concluding from effects, e.g. optical, about appropriate causes'', e.g. concrete physical objects. Intellect in his works is strictly connected with recognizing causes and effects and associating them, it is somewhat close to the contemporary view of [[cerebral cortex]] and formation of associations. The intellectuality of all perception implied then of course that causality is rooted in the world, precedes and enables experience. See [[s:Page:On the Fourfold Root, and On the Will in Nature.djvu/90|online text of his proof]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1780s [[Immanuel Kant]] suggested at a minimum our decision processes with moral implications lie outside the reach of everyday causality, and lie outside the rules governing material objects.&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Freeman introduces what he calls "circular causality" to "allow for the contribution of self-organizing dynamics", the "formation of macroscopic population dynamics that shapes the patterns of activity of the contributing individuals", applicable to "interactions between neurons and neural masses ... and between the behaving animal and its environment".&lt;ref name=Freeman&gt;{{cite book |title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |editor1=Susan Pockett |editor2=WP Banks |editor3=Shaun Gallagher |chapter=Consciousness, intentionality and causality |author=Freeman, Walter J. |publisher=MIT Press |year =2009 |isbn=0262512572 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5CaTnNksgkC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88 |page=88| quote=Circular causality departs so strongly from the classical tenets of necessity, invariance, and precise temporal order that the only reason to call it that is to satisfy the human habitual need for causes....

====Free will according to Thomas Aquinas====

Thirteenth century philosopher [[Thomas Aquinas]] viewed humans as pre-programmed (by virtue of being human) to seek certain goals, but able to choose between routes to achieve these goals (our Aristotelian [[telos (philosophy)|telos]]). His view has been associated with both compatibilism and libertarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 2| issue = 2| page = 74| last = Staley| first = Kevin M.| title = Aquinas: Compatibilist or Libertarian| journal = The Saint Anselm Journal| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 2005| url = http://www.anselm.edu/Documents/Institute%20for%20Saint%20Anselm%20Studies/Abstracts/4.5.3.2h_22Staley.pdf| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151221073832/http://www.anselm.edu/Documents/Institute%20for%20Saint%20Anselm%20Studies/Abstracts/4.5.3.2h_22Staley.pdf| archivedate = 2015-12-21| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Hartung| first = Christopher| title = Thomas Aquinas on Free Will| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = May 2013| publisher = University of Delaware| url = http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/12979}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In facing choices, he argued that humans are governed by ''intellect'', ''will'', and ''passions''. The will is "the primary mover of all the powers of the soul ... and it is also the efficient cause of motion in the body."&lt;ref name=Stump&gt;

A discussion of the roles of will, intellect and passions in Aquinas' teachings is found in {{cite book |title=Aquinas, ''Arguments of the philosophers series'' |author= Stump, Eleonore|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1GvL3eKhoM8C&amp;pg=PA278&amp;lpg=PA278 |pages=278 ''ff'' |isbn=0415029600 |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge (Psychology Press) |chapter= Intellect and will}}

&lt;/ref&gt; Choice falls into five stages: (i) intellectual consideration of whether an objective is desirable, (ii) intellectual consideration of means of attaining the objective, (iii) will arrives at an intent to pursue the objective, (iv) will and intellect jointly decide upon choice of means (v) will elects execution.&lt;ref name=OConnor0&gt;{{cite web |author=Timothy O'Connor |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/freewill/ |title= Free Will |work= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition) |editor= Edward N.

Furthermore, there are always external constraints on the range of options we can meaningfully try to undertake. As the presence or absence of these conditions and constraints are not (usually) our responsibility, it is plausible that the central loci of our responsibility are our choices, or "willings".}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free will enters as follows: Free will is an "appetitive power", that is, not a cognitive power of intellect (the term "appetite" from Aquinas's definition "includes all forms of internal inclination").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01656a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Appetite |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1907-03-01 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states that judgment "concludes and terminates counsel. Now counsel is terminated, first, by the judgment of reason; secondly, by the acceptation of the appetite [that is, the free-will]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1083.htm |title=Summa Theologica: Free-will (Prima Pars, Q. 83) |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A compatibilist interpretation of Aquinas's view is defended thus: "Free-will is the cause of its own movement, because by his free-will man moves himself to act. But it does not of necessity belong to liberty that what is free should be the first cause of itself, as neither for one thing to be cause of another need it be the first cause. God, therefore, is the first cause, Who moves causes both natural and voluntary. And just as by moving natural causes He does not prevent their acts being natural, so by moving voluntary causes He does not deprive their actions of being voluntary: but rather is He the cause of this very thing in them; for He operates in each thing according to its own nature."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa Theologiae'', Q83 A1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Further discussion of this compatibilistic theory can be found in Thomas' ''Summa contra gentiles'', Book III about Providence, c. 88–91 (260–67), where it is postulated that everything has its cause and it is again and again in detail referred also to all individual choices of man etc., even refuting opposite views. [http://dhspriory.org/thomas/ContraGentiles3b.htm#88 Here the online text of the Summa]. In order to avoid, at least in concept, the absolution of man of any guilt he then notes the contingency of all that takes place, i.e. lack of ''direct'' necessity from God strictly with regard to a concrete ("contingent") act. A typical choice was not separately ordained to be so-and-so by God; St. Thomas says the choice is not necessary, but in fact that apparently means it was ''contingent'' with regard to God and the law of nature (as a specific case that could have not existed in other circumstances), and ''necessary'' with regard to its direct previous cause in will and intellect. (The contingency, or fortuity, is even intuitive under modern [[chaos theory]], where one can try to show that more and more developed products appearing in the evolution of a universe or, simpler, an automaton are [[chaos theory|chaotic]] with regard to its principles.)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as a pseudo-problem====

Historically, most of the philosophical effort invested in resolving the dilemma has taken the form of close examination of definitions and ambiguities in the concepts designated by "free", "freedom", "will", "choice" and so forth. Defining 'free will' often revolves around the meaning of phrases like [https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22ability+to+do+otherwise%22+%22free+will%22&amp;gws_rd=ssl "ability to do otherwise"] or [https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22alternative+possibilities%22+%22free+will%22&amp;gws_rd=ssl "alternative possibilities"]. This emphasis upon words has led some philosophers to claim the problem is merely verbal and thus a pseudo-problem.&lt;ref name=Deery&gt;
{{cite book |title=The Philosophy of Free Will: Essential Readings from the Contemporary Debates |author1=Paul Russell |author2=Oisin Deery |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CLyi7nmzr28C&amp;pg=PA5 |page=5 |chapter=I. The free will problem – real or illusory |isbn=9780199733392 |year=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press }}
&lt;/ref&gt; In response, others point out the complexity of decision making and the importance of nuances in the terminology.

===History of free will===

The problem of free will has been identified in [[ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosophical]] literature. The notion of compatibilist free will has been attributed to both [[Aristotle]] (fourth century BCE) and [[Epictetus]] (1st century CE); "it was the fact that nothing hindered us from doing or choosing something that made us have control over them".&lt;ref name=bobzien1998determinism&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| last = Bobzien| first = Susanne| title = Determinism and freedom in Stoic philosophy| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 1998| url = https://books.google.com/?id=7kmTeOjHIqkC&amp;pg=PR12|quote="...Aristotle and Epictetus: In the latter authors it was the fact that nothing hindered us from doing or choosing something that made us have control over them. In Alexander's account, the terms are understood differently: what makes us have control over things is the fact that we are causally undetermined in our decision and thus can freely decide between doing/choosing or not doing/choosing them."| isbn = 9780198237945}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Bobzien| first = Susanne| title = Did Epicurus discover the free-will problem?| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 2000| url = http://philpapers.org/rec/BOBDED}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Susanne Bobzien]], the notion of incompatibilist free will is perhaps first identified in the works of [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] (third century CE); "what makes us have control over things is the fact that we are causally undetermined in our decision and thus can freely decide between doing/choosing or not doing/choosing them".

The term "free will" (''liberum arbitrium'') was introduced by Christian philosophy (4th century CE). It has traditionally meant (until the Enlightenment proposed its own meanings) lack of necessity in human will,&lt;ref&gt;A. Schopenhauer, ''On the Freedom of the Will'', c. 1, "What is freedom?"&lt;/ref&gt; so that "the will is free" meant "the will does not have to be such as it is". This requirement was universally embraced by both incompatibilists and compatibilists.&lt;ref&gt;Hence the notion of contingency appeared as the very opposition of necessity, so that wherever a thing is considered dependent or relies upon another thing, it is contingent and thus not necessary.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific approaches==

Science has contributed to the free will problem in at least three ways. First, physics has addressed the question whether nature is deterministic, which is viewed as crucial by incompatibilists (compatibilists, however, view it as irrelevant). Second, although free will can be defined in various ways, all of them involve aspects of the way people make decisions and initiate actions, which have been studied extensively by neuroscientists. Some of the experimental observations are widely viewed as implying that free will does not exist or is an illusion (but many philosophers see this as a misunderstanding). Third, psychologists have studied the beliefs that the majority of ordinary people hold about free will and its role in assigning moral responsibility.

===Quantum physics===
Early scientific thought often portrayed the universe as deterministic&amp;nbsp;– for example in the thought of [[Democritus]] or the [[Cārvāka]]ns&amp;nbsp;– and some thinkers claimed that the simple process of gathering sufficient [[physical information|information]] would allow them to predict future events with perfect accuracy. Modern science, on the other hand, is a mixture of deterministic and [[stochastic]] theories.&lt;ref&gt;Boniolo, G. and Vidali, P. (1999) ''Filosofia della Scienza'', Milan: Mondadori. {{ISBN|88-424-9359-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quantum mechanics]] predicts events only in terms of probabilities, casting doubt on whether the universe is deterministic at all, although evolution of the universal state vector is completely deterministic. Current physical theories cannot resolve the question of whether determinism is true of the world, being very far from a potential [[Theory of Everything]], and open to many different [[Interpretation of quantum mechanics|interpretations]].&lt;ref name="stanfordcausaldeterminism"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Carl |last=Hoefer |title=Causal Determinism |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=2008-04-01 |accessdate=2008-11-01 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Is the Universe Deterministic? |first=Vlatko |last=Vedral |volume=192 |issue=2578 |date=2006-11-18 |journal=New Scientist |quote=Physics is simply unable to resolve the question of free will, although, if anything, it probably leans towards determinism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming that an indeterministic interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct, one may still object that such indeterminism is for all practical purposes confined to microscopic phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytho/dfwVariousHonderichKanebook.htm |author=Honderich, E.|title= Determinism as True, Compatibilism and Incompatibilism as Both False, and the Real Problem |publisher=Ucl.ac.uk |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not always the case: many macroscopic phenomena are based on quantum effects. For instance, some [[hardware random number generator]]s work by amplifying quantum effects into practically usable signals. A more significant question is whether the indeterminism of quantum mechanics allows for the traditional idea of free will (based on a perception of free will). If a person's action is, however, only a result of complete quantum randomness, and mental processes as experienced have no influence on the probabilistic outcomes (such as volition),&lt;ref name="RKane1"/&gt; According to many interpretations, non-determinism enables free will to exist,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/quantum-physics-free-will/&lt;/ref&gt; while others assert the opposite (because the action was not controllable by the physical being who claims to possess the free will).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/features/2000/lujan1.html |title=Infidels. "Metaphysical Freedom" |publisher=Infidels.org |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetics===
Like physicists, [[biology|biologists]] have frequently addressed questions related to free will. One of the most heated debates in biology is that of "[[nature versus nurture]]", concerning the relative importance of genetics and biology as compared to culture and environment in human behavior.&lt;ref name="Pin"&gt;Pinel, P. J. (1990) ''Biopsychology''. Prentice Hall Inc. {{ISBN|88-15-07174-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view of many researchers is that many human behaviors can be explained in terms of humans' brains, genes, and evolutionary histories.&lt;ref&gt;DeFries, J.C., McGuffin, P., McClearn, G.E., Plomin, R. (2000) ''Behavioral Genetics'' 4th ed. W H Freeman &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris, D. (1967) ''The Naked Ape''. New York:McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|0-385-33430-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawk"&gt;Dawkins, R. (1976) ''The Selfish Gene''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|88-04-39318-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This point of view raises the fear that such attribution makes it impossible to hold others responsible for their actions. [[Steven Pinker]]'s view is that fear of determinism in the context of "genetics" and "evolution" is a mistake, that it is "a confusion of ''explanation'' with ''exculpation''". Responsibility does not require that behavior be uncaused, as long as behavior responds to praise and blame.&lt;ref name="Pink"&gt;Pinker, S. (2002) ''The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature''. London: Penguin. p. 179 {{ISBN|0-14-200334-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it is not certain that environmental determination is any less threatening to free will than genetic determination.&lt;ref name="Lew"&gt;Lewontin, R. (2000). ''It Ain't Necessarily So: The Dream of the Human Genome and other Illusions''. New York: NYREV Inc. {{ISBN|88-420-6418-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroscience and Neurophilosophy===
{{Main|Neurophilosophy|Neuroscience of free will}}
{{see also|Neurostimulation}}

It has become possible to study the living [[Human brain|brain]], and researchers can now watch the brain's decision-making process at work. A seminal experiment in this field was conducted by [[Benjamin Libet]] in the 1980s, in which he asked each subject to choose a random moment to flick their wrist while he measured the associated activity in their brain; in particular, the build-up of electrical signal called the [[readiness potential]] (after German [[Bereitschaftspotential]], which was discovered by [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]], 1965. Hirnpotentialänderungen bei Willkürbewegungen und passiven Bewegungen des Menschen: Bereitschaftspotential und reafferente Potentiale. Pflügers Arch 284: 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt;) Although it was well known that the readiness potential reliably preceded the physical action, Libet asked whether it could be recorded before the conscious intention to move. To determine when subjects felt the intention to move, he asked them to watch the second hand of a clock. After making a movement, the volunteer reported the time on the clock when they first felt the conscious intention to move; this became known as Libet's W time.&lt;ref name="LGW" /&gt;

Libet found that the ''unconscious'' brain activity of the readiness potential leading up to subjects' movements began approximately half a second before the subject was aware of a conscious intention to move.&lt;ref name="LGW"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0140525X00044903 | last1 = Libet | first1 = B. | year = 1985 | title = Unconscious cerebral initiative and the role of conscious will in voluntary action | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 529–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These studies of the timing between actions and the conscious decision bear upon the role of the brain in understanding free will. A subject's declaration of intention to move a finger appears ''after'' the brain has begun to implement the action, suggesting to some that unconsciously the brain has made the decision ''before'' the conscious mental act to do so. Some believe the implication is that free will was not involved in the decision and is an illusion. The first of these experiments reported the brain registered activity related to the move about 0.2 s before movement onset.&lt;ref name=Libet&gt;
{{cite journal|title=Time of conscious intention to act in relation to onset of cerebral activity (readiness-potential) |author=Benjamin Libet |display-authors=etal |journal=Brain |year=1983 |volume=106 |pages=623–42 |url=http://trans-techresearch.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Brain-1983-LIBET.pdf |doi=10.1093/brain/106.3.623 |pmid=6640273 |issue=3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526054605/http://trans-techresearch.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Brain-1983-LIBET.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these authors also found that awareness of action was ''anticipatory'' to activity in the muscle underlying the movement; the entire process resulting in action involves more steps than just the ''onset'' of brain activity. The bearing of these results upon notions of free will appears complex.&lt;ref name=Strother&gt;{{cite journal|title=The conscious experience of action and intention |author1=Lars Strother |author2=Sukhvinder Singh Obhi |journal=Exp Brain Res |volume=198 |year=2009 |pages=535–39 |doi=10.1007/s00221-009-1946-7 |url=http://publish.uwo.ca/~lstroth/StrotherObhi_EBR_2009.pdf |issue=4 |pmid=19641911 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217013640/http://publish.uwo.ca/~lstroth/StrotherObhi_EBR_2009.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Rosenbaum&gt;A brief discussion of possible interpretation of these results is found in {{cite book |title=Human Motor Control |page=86 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MsFmds_ACBwC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86 |isbn=0123742269 |year=2009 |edition=2nd |publisher=Academic Press |author=David A. Rosenbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that placing the question of free will in the context of motor control is too narrow. The objection is that the time scales involved in motor control are very short, and motor control involves a great deal of unconscious action, with much physical movement entirely unconscious. On that basis "... free will cannot be squeezed into time frames of 150–350 ms; free will is a longer term phenomenon" and free will is a higher level activity that "cannot be captured in a description of neural activity or of muscle activation...."&lt;ref name=Gallagher&gt;{{cite book |title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |author= Gallagher, Shaun|chapter=Chapter 6: Where's the action?

More studies have since been conducted, including some that try to:
* support Libet's original findings
* suggest that the cancelling or "veto" of an action may first arise subconsciously as well
* explain the underlying brain structures involved
* suggest models that explain the relationship between conscious intention and action

[[Benjamin Libet]]'s results are quoted&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Wegner|Wegner D.]], 2002. The Illusion of Conscious Will. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; in favor of epiphenomenalism, but he believes subjects still have a "conscious veto", since the readiness potential does not invariably lead to an action. In ''[[Freedom Evolves]]'', [[Daniel Dennett]] argues that a no-free-will conclusion is based on dubious assumptions about the location of consciousness, as well as questioning the accuracy and interpretation of Libet's results. [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] underlined that absence of conscious will during the early Bereitschaftspotential (termed BP1) is not a proof of the non-existence of free will, as also unconscious agendas may be free and non-deterministic. According to their suggestion, man has relative freedom, i.e. freedom in degrees, that can be in- or decreased through deliberate choices that involve both conscious and unconscious (panencephalic) processes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]], 2012.

Others have argued that data such as the [[Bereitschaftspotential]] undermine epiphenomenalism for the same reason, that such experiments rely on a subject reporting the point in time at which a conscious experience occurs, thus relying on the subject to be able to consciously perform an action. That ability would seem to be at odds with early epiphenomenalism, which according to Huxley is the broad claim that consciousness is "completely without any power… as the steam-whistle which accompanies the work of a locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery".&lt;ref name="Flanagan1992"&gt;{{cite book |first=O.J. |last=Flanagan |year=1992 |title=Consciousness Reconsidered |series=Bradford Books |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-56077-1 |lccn=lc92010057 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yFOqQgAACAAJ |page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been shown that in several brain-related conditions, individuals cannot entirely control their own actions, though the existence of such conditions does not directly refute the existence of free will. Neuroscientific studies are valuable tools in developing models of how humans experience free will.

For example, people with [[Tourette syndrome]] and related [[tic disorder]]s make involuntary movements and utterances (called [[tic]]s) despite the fact that they would prefer not to do so when it is socially inappropriate. Tics are described as semi-voluntary or ''unvoluntary'',&lt;ref name=TSADef&gt;Tourette Syndrome Association. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050322170245/http://www.tsa-usa.org/research/definitions.html Definitions and Classification of Tic Disorders.]. Retrieved 19 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; because they are not strictly ''involuntary'': they may be experienced as a ''voluntary'' response to an unwanted, premonitory urge. Tics are experienced as irresistible and must eventually be expressed.&lt;ref name=TSADef/&gt; People with Tourette syndrome are sometimes able to suppress their tics for limited periods, but doing so often results in an explosion of tics afterward. The control exerted (from seconds to hours at a time) may merely postpone and exacerbate the ultimate expression of the tic.&lt;ref name=Zinner&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zinner | first1 = S.H. | year = 2000 | title = Tourette disorder | url = | journal = Pediatric Review | volume = 21 | issue = 11| pmid = 11077021 | pages = 372–83 | doi=10.1542/pir.21-11-372| doi-broken-date = 2018-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[alien hand syndrome]], the afflicted individual's [[limb (anatomy)|limb]] will produce unintentional movements without the will of the person. The affected limb effectively demonstrates 'a will of its own.' The [[sense of agency]] does not emerge in conjunction with the overt appearance of the purposeful act even though the sense of ownership in relationship to the body part is maintained. This phenomenon corresponds with an impairment in the premotor mechanism manifested temporally by the appearance of the readiness potential (see section on the Neuroscience of Free Will above) recordable on the scalp several hundred milliseconds before the overt appearance of a spontaneous willed movement. Using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] with specialized multivariate analyses to study the temporal dimension in the activation of the cortical network associated with voluntary movement in human subjects, an anterior-to-posterior sequential activation process beginning in the supplementary motor area on the medial surface of the frontal lobe and progressing to the primary motor cortex and then to parietal cortex has been observed.&lt;ref name=Kayser&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/hbm.20771 | last1 = Kayser | first1 = A.S. | last2 = Sun | first2 = F.T. | last3 = D'Esposito | first3 = M. | year = 2009 | title = A comparison of Granger causality and coherency in fMRI-based analysis of the motor system | url = | journal = Human Brain Mapping | volume = 30 | issue = 11| pages = 3475–94 | pmid = 19387980 | pmc = 2767459 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sense of agency]] thus appears to normally emerge in conjunction with this orderly sequential network activation incorporating premotor association cortices together with primary motor cortex. In particular, the supplementary motor complex on the medial surface of the frontal lobe appears to activate prior to primary motor cortex presumably in associated with a preparatory pre-movement process. In a recent study using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]], alien movements were characterized by a relatively isolated activation of the primary motor cortex contralateral to the alien hand, while voluntary movements of the same body part included the natural activation of motor association cortex associated with the premotor process.&lt;ref name=Assal&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/ana.21173 | last1 = Assal | first1 = F. | last2 = Schwartz | first2 = S. | last3 = Vuilleumier | first3 = P. | year = 2007 | title = Moving with or without will: Functional neural correlates of alien hand syndrome | url = | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 62 | issue = 3| pages = 301–06 | pmid = 17638304 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The clinical definition requires "feeling that one limb is foreign or has a ''will of its own,'' together with observable involuntary motor activity" (emphasis in original).&lt;ref name=Doody&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.55.9.806 | last1 = Doody | first1 = RS | last2 = Jankovic | first2 = J. | year = 1992 | title = The alien hand and related signs | url = | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 55 | issue = 9| pages = 806–10 | pmid = 1402972 | pmc = 1015106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This syndrome is often a result of damage to the [[corpus callosum]], either when it is severed to treat intractable [[epilepsy]] or due to a [[stroke]].

In addition, one of the most important ("first rank") diagnostic symptoms of [[schizophrenia]] is the patient's delusion of being controlled by an external force.&lt;ref name=Schneider&gt;Schneider, K. (1959). ''Clinical Psychopathology.''

This is sometimes likened to being a robot controlled by someone else. Although the neural mechanisms of schizophrenia are not yet clear, one influential hypothesis is that there is a breakdown in brain systems that compare motor commands with the feedback received from the body (known as [[proprioception]]), leading to attendant [[hallucination]]s and [[delusions of control]].&lt;ref name=frith&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0165-0173(99)00052-1 | last1 = Frith | first1 = CD | last2 = Blakemore | first2 = S | last3 = Wolpert | first3 = DM | title = Explaining the symptoms of schizophrenia: abnormalities in the awareness of action | journal = Brain Research.

===Experimental psychology===
{{See also|Cognitive science|Cognitive psychology|Neuroscience}}
[[Experimental psychology]]'s contributions to the free will debate have come primarily through social psychologist [[Daniel Wegner]]'s work on conscious will. In his book, ''The Illusion of Conscious Will''&lt;ref name = "WegnerBook"&gt;Wegner, D.M. (2002). ''The illusion of conscious will.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Wegner summarizes what he believes is [[empirical evidence]] supporting the view that human perception of conscious control is an illusion. Wegner summarizes some empirical evidence that may suggest that the perception of conscious control is open to modification (or even manipulation). Wegner observes that one event is inferred to have caused a second event when two requirements are met:
# The first event immediately precedes the second event, and
# The first event is consistent with having caused the second event.
For example, if a person hears an explosion and sees a tree fall down that person is likely to infer that the explosion caused the tree to fall over. However, if the explosion occurs after the tree falls down (that is, the first requirement is not met), or rather than an explosion, the person hears the ring of a telephone (that is, the second requirement is not met), then that person is not likely to infer that either noise caused the tree to fall down.

Wegner has applied this principle to the inferences people make about their own conscious will. People typically experience a thought that is consistent with a behavior, and then they observe themselves performing this behavior. As a result, people infer that their thoughts must have caused the observed behavior. However, Wegner has been able to manipulate people's thoughts and behaviors so as to conform to or violate the two requirements for causal inference.&lt;ref name="WegnerBook"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.54.7.480 | last1 = Wegner | first1 = D.M. | last2 = Wheatley | first2 = T. | year = 1999 | title = Apparent mental causation: sources of the experience of will | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 54 | issue = 7| pages = 480–91 | pmid=10424155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through such work, Wegner has been able to show that people often experience conscious will over behaviors that they have not, in fact, caused&amp;nbsp;– and conversely, that people can be led to experience a lack of will over behaviors they did cause. For instance, [[priming (psychology)|priming]] subjects with information about an effect increases the probability that a person falsely believes is the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Emily Pronin]] has argued that the subjective experience of free will is supported by the [[introspection illusion]]. This is the tendency for people to trust the reliability of their own introspections while distrusting the introspections of other people. The theory implies that people will more readily attribute free will to themselves rather than others. This prediction has been confirmed by three of Pronin and Kugler's experiments. When college students were asked about personal decisions in their own and their roommate's lives, they regarded their own choices as less predictable. Staff at a restaurant described their co-workers' lives as more determined (having fewer future possibilities) than their own lives. When weighing up the influence of different factors on behavior, students gave desires and intentions the strongest weight for their own behavior, but rated personality traits as most predictive of other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pronin|first=Emily|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, Vol. 41|editor=Mark P. Zanna|chapter=The Introspection Illusion |volume=41|publisher=Academic Press|pages=42–43|year=2009|isbn=978-0-12-374472-2|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)00401-2|ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists have shown that reducing a person's belief in free will makes them less helpful and more aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = RF | last2 = Masicampo | first2 = EJ | last3 = Dewall | first3 = CN | year = 2009 | title = Prosocial benefits of feeling free: disbelief in free will increases aggression and reduces helpfulness | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 35 | issue = 2| pages = 260–68 | doi = 10.1177/0146167208327217 | pmid = 19141628 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may occur because the subject loses a sense of [[self-efficacy]].

Caveats have, however, been identified in studying a subject's awareness of mental events, in that the process of introspection itself may alter the experience.&lt;ref name=Pockett&gt;{{cite book|title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |chapter=The neuroscience of movement |author=Susan Pockett |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5CaTnNksgkC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19 |page=19 |editor1=Susan Pockett |editor2=WP Banks |editor3=Shaun Gallagher |publisher=MIT Press |year =2009 |isbn=0262512572|quote=...it is important to be clear about exactly what experience one wants one's subjects to introspect. Of course, explaining to subjects exactly what the experimenter wants them to experience can bring its own problems–...instructions to attend to a particular internally generated experience can easily alter both the timing and the content of that experience and even whether or not it is consciously experienced at all.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J.B. Miles]] contradicts the idea that free will has prosocial benefits, recognizing that many distinguished minds have already brought up the negative effects that such a belief would ensure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miles | first1 = J.B. | year = 2011 | title = 'Irresponsible and a Disservice': The integrity of social psychology turns on the free will dilemma | url = | journal = British Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 2| pages = 205–18 | doi = 10.1111/j.2044-8309.2011.02077.x | pmid = 22074173 | pmc = 3757306 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The explanation for the commonality of this mix-up is a lack of knowledge regarding the free will debate in psychological research. Miles analyzed the methods of popular studies and concluded that such research purported to be examining associations between behavior and disbelief in free will are actually examining the associations between behavior and belief in fatalism. While evidence of the negative effects of a belief in fatalism is legitimate, the research fails to study the effects of belief on free will which they claim to discuss. This occurrence is due to an incorrect understanding and implication that fatalism accompanies determinism. Fatalism is distinguished by the idea that decisions lack effect on the future because everything is determined. Conversely, determinism is the belief that everything operates under cause and effect; every action determines a reaction. Determinism, therefore emphasizes the importance and responsibility one has in decision making as every choice will have an accompanying effect. Seeing this flaw throughout commonly cited research, Miles presents countering research which includes “evidence that the myth of free choice encourages immoral, unjust, prejudiced, and anti-intellectual behaviour.” Miles suggests that while both extremes of fatalism and belief in free will result in negative social outcomes, determinism serves to encourage intentional, prosocial decision making. Ultimately, the point of this research is to encourage accurate knowledge of the free will debate when conducting and evaluating such studies in experimental psychology.

Regardless of the validity of, or benefit of, belief in free will, it may be beneficial to understand where the idea comes from. One contribution is randomness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ebert | first1 = J.P. | last2 = Wegner | first2 = D.M. | year = 2011 | title = March 1). Mistaking randomness for free will | url = | journal = Consciousness and Cognition | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 965–71 | doi = 10.1016/j.concog.2010.12.012 | pmid = 21367624 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is established that randomness is not the only factor in the perception of the free will, it has been shown that randomness can be mistaken as free will due to its indeterminacy. This misconception applies both when considering oneself and others. Another contribution is choice.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, G., Baumeister, R.F., &amp; Wong, K.F. (2014, July 30). Free will is about choosing: The link between choice and the belief in free will. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 55, 239–45. {{doi|10.1016/j.jesp.2014.07.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been demonstrated that people's belief in free will increases if presented with a simple level of choice. The specificity of the amount of choice is important, as too little or too great a degree of choice may negatively influence belief. It is also likely that the associative relationship between level of choice and perception of free will is influentially bidirectional. It is also possible that one's desire for control, or other basic motivational patterns, act as a third variable.

===Believing in free will{{anchor|Believing in free will}}===
In recent years, free will belief in individuals has been analysed with respect to traits in social behaviour. In general the concept of free will researched to date in this context has been that of the incompatibilist, or more specifically, the libertarian, that is freedom from determinism.

====What people believe====
Whether people naturally adhere to an incompatibilist model of free will has been questioned in the research. Eddy Nahmias has found that incompatibilism is not intuitive&amp;nbsp;– it was not adhered to, in that determinism does not negate belief in moral responsibility (based on an empirical study of people's responses to moral dilemmas under a deterministic model of reality).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nahmias|first=Eddy|author2=Stephen G Morris|author3=Thomas Nadelhoffer|author4=Jason Turner|date=2006-07-01|title=Is Incompatibilism Intuitive?|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|volume=73|issue=1|pages=28–53|doi=10.1111/j.1933-1592.2006.tb00603.x|issn=1933-1592|citeseerx=10.1.1.364.1083}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2011-04-29--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Cokely has found that incompatibilism is intuitive&amp;nbsp;– it was naturally adhered to, in that determinism does indeed negate belief in moral responsibility in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feltz|first=Adam|author2=Edward T.

Studies indicate that peoples' belief in free will is inconsistent. Emily Pronin and Matthew Kugler found that people believe they have more free will than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1012046108| pmid = 21149703| volume = 107| issue = 52| pages = 22469–74| last = Pronin| first = Emily|author2=Matthew B.

Studies also reveal a correlation between the likelihood of accepting a deterministic model of mind and personality type. For example, Adam Feltz and Edward Cokely found that people of an extrovert personality type are more likely to dissociate belief in determinism from belief in moral responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feltz|first=Adam|author2=Edward T.

[[Roy Baumeister]] and colleagues reviewed literature on the psychological effects of a belief (or disbelief) in free will. The first part of their analysis (which the only relevant part to this section) was not meant to discover the types of free will that actually exist. The researchers instead sought to identify what people believe, how many people believed it, and the effects of those beliefs. Baumeister found that most people tend to believe in a sort of "naive compatibilistic free will".&lt;ref name=BAC&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R. | last2 = Crescioni | first2 = A.W. | last3 = Alquist | first3 = J. | year = 2009 | title = Free will as advanced action control for human social life and culture | url = | journal = Neuroethics | volume =4| issue = | pages =1–11| doi = 10.1007/s12152-010-9058-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paulhus, D.L. and Margesson.

Taking into account all these personal variables existing in the debates over free will, Manuel Vargas has generally assumed that in fact “there is nearly always an unremarked upon elephant that lurks in rooms where philosophers discuss free will”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vargas|first=Manuel|date=2004|title=Libertarianism and Skepticism about Free Will|journal=Philosophical Topics|volume=32|issue=1|pages=403–426|doi=10.5840/philtopics2004321/210|issn=0276-2080}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he particularly pointed to the role of (i)religion in motivating and sustaining various accounts of free will. As he put,&lt;blockquote&gt;My guess is that we would learn that a disproportionate number—perhaps even most—libertarians are religious and, especially, Christian. I suspect we would also learn that the overwhelming majority of compatibilists are atheist or agnostic. (I do not have a guess about the religious predilections of the various stripes of skeptical incompatibilists.) Even so, it may not be obvious why the religious beliefs of particular philosophers should matter. We could think that the arguments of the various partisans in free will debates should be judged on their merits, irrespective of whether or not they have religious motivation. However, systematically ignoring the role of religion can remove important considerations from view, considerations that affect how we think about, argue, and evaluate the various philosophical possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;For example, by a detailed analysis of the writings and work of Arthur Eddington and Arthur Holy Compton in the English speaking world of the late 1920s and 1930s, one analysis clearly revealed not only a strong intrinsic religious motivation and specific conservative worldview concerns behind their own work on free will, but also similar personal, political and ideological factors, only of the opposite sign, in their opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Kožnjak|first=Boris|title=The Earliest Missionaries of 'Quantum Free Will': A Socio-Historical Analysis|volume=6|date=2018|work=Free Will &amp; Action|pages=131–154|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-99295-2_10|isbn=9783319992945|series=Historical-Analytical Studies on Nature, Mind and Action}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Among philosophers====
A recent 2009 survey has shown that compatibilism is quite a popular stance among those who specialize in philosophy (59%). Belief in libertarianism amounted to 14%, while a lack of belief in free will equaled 12%. More than a half of surveyed people were US Americans.&lt;ref&gt;D. Bourget, D.J. Chalmers: ''What do philosophers believe?''. Philosophical Studies (3): 1–36 (2013). [http://philpapers.org/archive/BOUWDP.pdf Online text here]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Among evolutionary biologists====
79 percent of evolutionary biologists said that they believe in free-will according to a survey conducted in 2007, only 14 percent chose no free will, and 7 percent did not answer the question.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory W. Graffin and William B. Provine, “Evolution, Religion, and Free Will,” American Scientist 95 (July–August 2007), 294–97; results of Cornell Evolution Project survey,

====Effects of the belief itself====
{{see also|Self-efficacy}}

{{Quotebox|align=right|width=40%|quoted=1|quote= An alternative explanation builds on the idea that subjects tend to confuse determinism with fatalism... What happens then when agents’ self-efficacy is undermined? It is not that their basic desires and drives are defeated. It is rather, I suggest, that they become skeptical that they can control those desires; and in the face of that skepticism, they fail to apply the effort that is needed even to try. If they were tempted to behave badly, then coming to believe in fatalism makes them less likely to resist that temptation.|source=—Richard Holton&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt;}}
Baumeister and colleagues found that provoking disbelief in free will seems to cause various negative effects. The authors concluded, in their paper, that it is belief in [[determinism]] that causes those negative effects.&lt;ref name=BAC/&gt; This may not be a very justified conclusion, however.&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt; First of all, free will can at least refer to either [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian (indeterministic) free will]] or [[Compatibilism|compatibilistic (deterministic) free will]]. Having participants read articles that simply "disprove free will" is unlikely to increase their understanding of determinism, or the compatibilistic free will that it still permits.&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt;

In other words, "provoking disbelief in free will" probably causes a belief in [[fatalism]]. As discussed earlier in this article, compatibilistic free will is illustrated by statements like ''"my choices have causes, and an effect&amp;nbsp;– so I affect my future"'', whereas fatalism is more like ''"my choices have causes, but no effect&amp;nbsp;– I am powerless"''. Fatalism, then, may be what threatens people's sense of [[self-efficacy]]. Lay people should not confuse fatalism with determinism, and yet even professional philosophers occasionally confuse the two. It is thus likely that the negative consequences below can be accounted for by participants developing a belief in ''fatalism'' when experiments attack belief in "free will".&lt;ref name=Holton&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holton | first1 = Richard | year = 2011 | title = Response to 'Free Will as Advanced Action Control for Human Social Life and Culture' by Roy F.

Alquist | url = | journal = Neuroethics | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 13–16 | doi = 10.1007/s12152-009-9046-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To test the effects of belief in determinism, future studies would need to provide articles that do not simply "attack free will", but instead focus on explaining determinism and compatibilism. Some studies have been conducted indicating that people react strongly to the way in which mental determinism is described, when reconciling it with moral responsibility. Eddy Nahmias has noted that when people's actions are framed with respect to their beliefs and desires (rather than their neurological underpinnings), they are more likely to dissociate determinism from moral responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nahmias|first=Eddy|author2=D.

Various social behavioural traits have been correlated with the belief in deterministic models of mind, some of which involved the experimental subjection of individuals to libertarian and deterministic perspectives.

After researchers provoked volunteers to disbelieve in free will, participants lied, cheated, and stole more. Kathleen Vohs has found that those whose belief in free will had been eroded were more likely to cheat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02045.x| volume = 19| issue = 1| pages = 49–54| last = Vohs| first = Kathleen D.|author2=Jonathan W.

Baumeister and colleagues also note that volunteers disbelieving in free will are less capable of [[counterfactual thinking]].&lt;ref name=BAC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alquist, J.L., M. Daly, T. Stillman, and R.F. Baumeister, (2009). [Belief in determinism decreases counterfactual thinking].

Roese. 2008. The functional theory of counterfactual thinking. Personality and Social Psychology 12: 168–92.&lt;/ref&gt; Again, this cannot be taken to mean that belief in determinism is to blame; these are the results we would expect from increasing people's belief in fatalism.&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt;

==Eastern philosophy==

===Hindu philosophy===
{{see also|Free will in theology#Hinduism}}
The six orthodox ([[astik]]a) schools of thought in [[Hindu philosophy]] do not agree with each other entirely on the question of free will. For the [[Samkhya]], for instance, matter is without any freedom, and soul lacks any ability to control the unfolding of matter. The only real freedom (''kaivalya'') consists in realizing the ultimate separateness of matter and self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fapXqp-JSL0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=kaivalya|title=The ascetic self: subjectivity, memory and tradition |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-60401-7|page=73|last=Flood|first=Gavin|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Yoga]] school, only [[Ishvara]] is truly free, and its freedom is also distinct from all feelings, thoughts, actions, or wills, and is thus not at all a freedom of will. The metaphysics of the [[Nyaya]] and [[Vaisheshika]] schools strongly suggest a belief in determinism, but do not seem to make explicit claims about determinism or free will.&lt;ref name="koller"&gt;Koller, J. (2007) ''Asian Philosophies''. 5th ed. Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-092385-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A quotation from [[Swami Vivekananda]], a [[Vedanta|Vedantist]], offers a good example of the worry about free will in the Hindu tradition.
{{quote|text=Therefore we see at once that there cannot be any such thing as free-will; the very words are a contradiction, because will is what we know, and everything that we know is within our universe, and everything within our universe is moulded by conditions of time, space and causality. ... To acquire freedom we have to get beyond the limitations of this universe; it cannot be found here.&lt;ref name = "viveka"/&gt;}}
However, the preceding quote has often been misinterpreted as Vivekananda implying that everything is predetermined. What Vivekananda actually meant by lack of free will was that the will was not "free" because it was heavily influenced by the law of cause and effect&amp;nbsp;– "The will is not free, it is a phenomenon bound by cause and effect, but there is something behind the will which is free."&lt;ref name = "viveka"&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda]] (1907) {{cite web |url=http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_5/sayings_and_utterances.htm |title=Sayings and utterances |publisher=ramakrishnavivekananda.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vivekananda never said things were absolutely determined and placed emphasis on the power of conscious choice to alter one's past [[Karma in Hinduism|karma]]: "It is the coward and the fool who says this is his [[Destiny|fate]]. But it is the strong man who stands up and says I will make my own fate."&lt;ref name = "viveka"/&gt;

===Buddhist philosophy===
[[Buddhism]] accepts both freedom and determinism (or something similar to it), but in spite of its focus towards the human agency, rejects the western concept of a total agent from external sources.&lt;ref name="Gier"&gt;Gier, Nicholas and Kjellberg, Paul. "Buddhism and the Freedom of the Will: Pali and Mahayanist Responses" in Freedom and Determinism. Campbell, Joseph Keim; O'Rourke, Michael; and Shier, David. 2004. MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]], "There is free action, there is retribution, but I see no agent that passes out from one set of momentary elements into another one, except the [connection] of those elements."&lt;ref name="Gier"/&gt; Buddhists believe in neither absolute free will, nor determinism. It preaches a middle doctrine, named ''[[pratitya-samutpada]]'' in [[Sanskrit]], often translated as "inter-dependent arising". This theory is also called "Conditioned Genesis" or "[[Dependent Origination]]". It teaches that every volition is a conditioned action as a result of ignorance. In part, it states that free will is inherently conditioned and not "free" to begin with. It is also part of the theory of [[karma in Buddhism]]. The concept of karma in Buddhism is different from the notion of karma in Hinduism. In Buddhism, the idea of karma is much less deterministic. The Buddhist notion of karma is primarily focused on the cause and effect of moral actions in this life, while in Hinduism the concept of karma is more often connected with determining one's [[destiny]] in future lives.

In Buddhism it is taught that the idea of absolute freedom of choice (that is that any human being could be completely free to make any choice) is unwise, because it denies the reality of one's physical needs and circumstances. Equally incorrect is the idea that humans have no choice in life or that their lives are pre-determined. To deny freedom would be to deny the efforts of Buddhists to make moral progress (through our capacity to freely choose compassionate action). ''Pubbekatahetuvada'', the belief that all happiness and suffering arise from previous actions, is considered a wrong view according to Buddhist doctrines. Because Buddhists also reject [[agency (philosophy)|agenthood]], the traditional compatibilist strategies are closed to them as well. Instead, the Buddhist philosophical strategy is to examine the metaphysics of causality. Ancient India had many heated arguments about the nature of causality with [[Jain]]s, [[Nyaya|Nyayists]], [[Samkhya|Samkhyists]], [[Cārvāka]]ns, and Buddhists all taking slightly different lines. In many ways, the Buddhist position is closer to a theory of "conditionality" than a theory of "causality", especially as it is expounded by [[Nagarjuna]] in the ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]''.&lt;ref name="Gier"/&gt;

==In theology==
{{Main|Free will in theology}}

=== Christianity ===
[[File:Antonio Rodríguez - Saint Augustine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|Augustine's view of free will and predestination would go on to have a profound impact on Christian theology]]

The notions of free will and predestination are heavily debated among Christians. Free will in the Christian sense is the ability to choose between good or evil. Among Catholics, there are those holding to [[Thomism]], adopted from what [[Thomas Aquinas]] put forth in the ''[[Summa Theologica]].'' There are also some holding to [[Molinism]] which was put forth by Jesuit priest [[Luis de Molina]]. Among Protestants there is [[Arminianism]], held primarily by [[Methodist]] and some [[Baptist]], and formulated by Dutch theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]]; and there is also [[Calvinism]] held by most in the [[Reformed]] tradition which was formulated by the French Reformed theologian, [[John Calvin]]. John Calvin was heavily influenced by [[Augustine of Hippo]] views on predestination put forth in his work ''On the Predestination of the Saints.'' [[Martin Luther]] seems to hold views on predestination similar to Calvinism in his ''[[On the Bondage of the Will]],'' thus rejecting free will. In condemnation of Calvin and Luther views, the Council of Trent declared that "the free will of man, moved and excited by God, can by its consent co-operate with God, Who excites and invites its action; and that it can thereby dispose and prepare itself to obtain the grace of justification. The will can resist grace if it chooses. It is not like a lifeless thing, which remains purely passive. Weakened and diminished by Adam's fall, free will is yet not destroyed in the race (Sess. VI, cap. i and v)."

[[Paul the Apostle]] discusses Predestination in some of his Epistles.

"''For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the first-born among many brethren; and whom He predestined, these He also called; and whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.''” —[[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 8:29–30

“''He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will.''” —[[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 1:5

The exact meaning of these verses has been debated by Christian theologians throughout history.

=== Judaism ===
[[File:Flickr - USCapitol - Maimonides (1135-1204).jpg|thumb|right|[[Bas relief]] of Maimonides in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]].]]
[[Maimonides]] reasoned that human beings have free will (at least in the context of choosing to do good or evil).  Without free will, the demands of [[Nevi'im#Latter Prophets|the prophets]] would have been meaningless, there would be no need for the [[Torah]], and justice could not be administered.  In Maimonides's view, human free will is granted by God as part of the universe's design.&lt;ref&gt;Rambam Teshuvah 5:4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islam ===

In [[Islam]] the theological issue is not usually how to reconcile free will with God's foreknowledge, but with God's ''jabr'', or divine commanding power. [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari|al-Ash'ari]] developed an "acquisition" or "dual-agency" form of compatibilism, in which human free will and divine ''jabr'' were both asserted, and which became a cornerstone of the dominant [[Ash'ari]] position.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Montgomery Watt|Watt, Montgomery]]. Free-Will and Predestination in Early Islam. Luzac &amp; Co.: London 1948; [[Harry Austryn Wolfson|Wolfson, Harry]]. The Philosophy of Kalam, Harvard University Press 1976&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Shia]] Islam, Ash'aris understanding of a higher balance toward [[predestination]] is challenged by most theologians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/mananddestiny/3.htm |title=Man and His Destiny |publisher=Al-islam.org |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free will, according to Islamic doctrine is the main factor for man's accountability in his/her actions throughout life. Actions taken by people exercising free will are counted on the [[Day of Judgement]] because they are their own; however, the free will happens with the permission of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tosun|first=Ender|title=Guide to Understanding Islam|year=2012|location=Istanbul|isbn=978-605-631-981-5|url=http://www.islamicinformationcenter.info/understandingislam.pdf|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Others ===

The philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] claimed that divine omnipotence cannot be separated from divine goodness.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Timothy P. (1998) "Arminian edification: Kierkegaard on grace and free will" in ''Cambridge Companion to Kierkegaard'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; As a truly omnipotent and good being, God could create beings with true freedom over God. Furthermore, God would voluntarily do so because "the greatest good ... which can be done for a being, greater than anything else that one can do for it, is to be truly free."&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. (1848) ''Journals and Papers'', vol. III. Reprinted in Indiana University Press, Bloomington, 1967–78.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alvin Plantinga]]'s "[[Plantinga's free will defense|free will defense]]" is a contemporary expansion of this theme, adding how God, free will, and [[problem of evil|evil]] are consistent.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, J.L. (1955) "Evil and Omnipotence", ''Mind'', new series, vol. 64, pp. 200–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some philosophers follow [[William of Ockham]] in holding that necessity and possibility are defined with respect to a given point in time and a given matrix of empirical circumstances, and so something that is merely possible from the perspective of one observer may be necessary from the perspective of an omniscient.&lt;ref name="ockham"&gt;Ockham, William. Predestination, God's Knowledge, and Future Contingents, early 14th century, trans. Marilyn McCord Adams and [[Norman Kretzmann]] 1982, Hackett, esp pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers follow [[Philo of Alexandria]], a philosopher known for his [[homocentrism]], in holding that free will is a feature of a human's [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], and thus that non-human [[animal]]s lack free will.&lt;ref&gt;[[H. A. Wolfson]], ''Philo'', 1947 Harvard University Press; Religious Philosophy, 1961 Harvard University Press; and "St. Augustine and the Pelagian Controversy" in Religious Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born on 15 December 1923, at [[Crowthorne]] in [[Berkshire]], Dyson is the son of the English composer [[George Dyson (composer)|George Dyson]], who was later knighted. His mother had a law degree, and after Dyson was born she worked as a social worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildriverreview.com/quarkpark_dyson.php |title=The Scientist as Rebel |access-date=5 December 2017}} Wild River Review Interview by Joy E. Stocke&lt;/ref&gt; Although not known to be related to the early 20th-century astronomer [[Frank Watson Dyson]], as a small boy Dyson was aware of him and has credited the popularity of an astronomer sharing his surname with helping to spark his own interest in science.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman Dyson. From Eros to Gaia 1992 p.vii&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of five he calculated the number of atoms in the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |medium=Video |title=Greatest Mysteries of the Cold War: America's Interplanetary Spaceship (Project Orion) |publisher=BBC Four}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, he showed an interest in large numbers and in the solar system, and was strongly influenced by the book ''[[Men of Mathematics]]'' by [[Eric Temple Bell]].&lt;ref name=wired20140331 /&gt; Politically, Dyson says he was "brought up as a socialist".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Ghodsee | first = Kristen | year = 2015 | title = The Left Side of History: World War II and the Unfulfilled Promise of Communism in Eastern Europe | location = Durham, NC | publisher = Duke University Press | page = 5 | isbn = 978-0-822-35823-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1936 to 1941, Dyson was a Scholar at [[Winchester College]], where his father was Director of Music. At age 17 he studied mathematics with [[G.H. Hardy]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] (where he won a scholarship at age 15) and at age 19 was assigned to war work in the [[Operations research#Second World War|Operational Research Section]] (ORS) of the Royal Air Force's [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]],&lt;ref name=MIT&gt;{{cite web|last=Dyson|first=Freeman|title=A Failure of Intelligence|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/article/406789/a-failure-of-intelligence/|website=MIT Technology Review Magazine|publisher=MIT Technology Review|access-date=20 October 2013|date=1 November 2006|quote=Prominent physicist Freeman Dyson recalls the time he spent developing analytical methods to help the British Royal Air Force bomb German targets during World War II.}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he developed analytical methods to help the Royal Air Force bomb German targets during the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref name=MIT /&gt; After the war, Dyson was readmitted to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;''Fractals in Physics: Essays in Honour of Benoit B. Mandelbrot : Proceedings of the International Conference Honouring Benoit B. Mandelbrot on His 65th Birthday, Vence, France, 1–4 October 1989'', p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; where he obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree in mathematics.&lt;ref name=IAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Freeman Dyson|url=http://www.sns.ias.edu/dyson/|website=Institute for Advanced Study, School of Natural Sciences|publisher=Princeton University|access-date=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1946 to 1949, he was a [[Fellow]] of his college, occupying rooms just below those of the philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], who resigned his professorship in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F. (10 Nov 2011) [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/nov/08/what-can-you-really-know/?pagination=false "What Can You Really Know"], [[New York Review of Books]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, Dyson published two papers in [[number theory]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Approximation to Algebraic Numbers by Rationals," Acta Mathematica (Uppsala), 89, 1947, pp. 225–240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
"On Simultaneous Diophantine Approximations," Proceedings of the London
Mathematical Society, Series 2, 49, 1947, pp. 409–420.&lt;/ref&gt; Friends and colleagues describe him as shy and self-effacing, with a contrarian streak that his friends find refreshing but his intellectual opponents find exasperating. "I have the sense that when consensus is forming like ice hardening on a lake, Dyson will do his best to chip at the ice", [[Steven Weinberg]] said of him. His friend, the neurologist and author [[Oliver Sacks]], said: "A favourite word of Freeman's about doing science and being creative is the word 'subversive'. He feels it's rather important not only to be not orthodox, but to be subversive, and he's done that all his life."&lt;ref name="civil"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Dawidoff |first=Nicholas |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/magazine/29Dyson-t.html?_r=1&amp;ref=magazine |title=The Civil Heretic |work=The New York Times Magazine |date=25 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{clarify|reason=How does the following pertain to character?|date=November 2013}}

===Career in the United States===
On [[G. I. Taylor]]'s advise and recommendation, Dyson moved to the United States in 1947 as a Commonwealth Fellow to earn a physics doctorate with [[Hans Bethe]] at [[Cornell University]] (1947–48).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |subject= Freeman Dyson |interviewer=Finn Aaserud |title=Freeman Dyson |url=https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/oral-histories/4585 |publisher=American Institute of Physics |location=Princeton, New Jersey |date=17 December 1986 |work=Oral History Interviews }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = QED and the Men Who Made It|last = Schweber|first = Silvan S.|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 1994|isbn = |location = Princeton, NJ|pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=61n5dE7FJQgC&amp;pg=492 392ff]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a week, however, he had made the acquaintance of [[Richard Feynman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlaPLvETBug|title = Freeman Dyson: A 'Rebel' Without a Ph.D|last = |first = |date = 11 June 2015|language = |at = Event at 1:17 |publisher = Quanta Magazine|access-date = 20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The budding English physicist recognized the brilliance of the flamboyant American, and attached himself as quickly as possible. He then moved to the Institute for Advanced Study (1948–49), before returning to England (1949–51), where he was a research fellow at the [[University of Birmingham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Freeman Dyson |url=http://www.aip.org/history/acap/biographies/bio.jsp?dysonf |publisher=The American Institute of Physics |access-date=23 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017131442/http://www.aip.org/history/acap/biographies/bio.jsp?dysonf |archivedate=17 October 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dyson never got his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree.

In 1949, Dyson demonstrated the equivalence of two then-current formulations of [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED): [[Richard Feynman]]'s diagrams and the operator method developed by [[Julian Schwinger]] and [[Shin'ichirō Tomonaga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=F. J. Dyson|title= The radiation theories of Tomonaga, Schwinger, and Feynman|journal=Phys. Rev.|volume=75|pages=486–502|year=1949|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.75.486|issue=3|bibcode = 1949PhRv...75..486D }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first person after their creator to appreciate the power of [[Feynman diagram]]s, and his paper written in 1948 and published in 1949 was the first to make use of them. He said in that paper that Feynman diagrams were not just a computational tool, but a physical theory, and developed rules for the diagrams that completely solved the [[renormalization]] problem. Dyson's paper and also his lectures presented Feynman's theories of QED in a form that other physicists could understand, facilitating the physics community's acceptance of Feynman's work. [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], in particular, was persuaded by Dyson that Feynman's new theory was as valid as Schwinger's and Tomonaga's. Oppenheimer rewarded Dyson with a lifetime appointment at the Institute for Advanced Study, "for proving me wrong", in Oppenheimer's words.&lt;ref name="Dyson, F.J. 1979"/&gt;

Also in 1949, in related work, Dyson invented the [[Dyson series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=F. J. Dyson|title= The S matrix in quantum electrodynamics|journal=[[Phys. Rev.]]|volume=75|pages=1736–1755|year=1949|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.75.1736|issue=11|bibcode = 1949PhRv...75.1736D }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was this paper that inspired [[John Clive Ward|John Ward]] to derive his celebrated [[Ward–Takahashi identity#The Ward identity|Ward identity]].&lt;ref name="qeid-jw-1950"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=J. C. Ward|journal=Phys. Rev.|volume=78|page=182|year=1950|bibcode = 1950PhRv...78..182W |doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.78.182|title=An Identity in Quantum Electrodynamics|issue=2 }}. [Note: this Ward letter opens with "It has been recently proven by Dyson&amp;nbsp;..."]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Dyson joined the faculty at Cornell as a physics professor, although still lacking a doctorate, and in 1953, he received a permanent post at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], where he has now lived for more than sixty years.&lt;ref name="civil" /&gt; In 1957, he became a [[Naturalization|naturalized citizen]] of the United States and renounced his [[British nationality law|British nationality]]. One reason he gave decades later is that his children born in the United States had not been recognized as British subjects.&lt;ref name="brit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="abjure" /&gt;

From 1957 to 1961, he worked on [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]], which proposed the possibility of space-flight using [[nuclear pulse propulsion]]. A prototype was demonstrated using [[Explosive material|conventional explosives]], but the 1963 [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty|Partial Test Ban Treaty]], in which Dyson was involved and supported, permitted only [[underground nuclear weapons testing]], so the project was abandoned.

In 1958, he led the design team for the [[TRIGA]], a small, inherently safe [[nuclear reactor]] used throughout the world in hospitals and universities for the production of [[Isotopes in medicine|medical isotopes]].

A seminal paper by Dyson came in 1966, when, together with Andrew Lenard and independently of [[Elliott H. Lieb]] and [[Walter Thirring]], he proved rigorously that the [[Pauli exclusion principle|exclusion principle]] plays the main role in the stability of bulk matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=F. J. Dyson, A. Lenard|journal=[[J. Math. Phys.]]|volume=8|issue=3|pages=423–434|year=1967|doi=10.1063/1.1705209|title=Stability of Matter. I|bibcode = 1967JMP.....8..423D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= F. J. Dyson, A. Lenard|journal=J. Math. Phys.|volume=9|issue= 5|pages= 698–711 |year=1968|doi= 10.1063/1.1664631|title= Stability of Matter. II|bibcode = 1968JMP.....9..698L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= E. H. Lieb, W. Thirring|journal=[[Phys. Rev. Lett.]]|volume=35|pages=687–689 |year=1975|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevLett.35.687|title= Bound for the Kinetic Energy of Fermions Which Proves the Stability of Matter|issue= 11|bibcode = 1975PhRvL..35..687L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, it is not the electromagnetic repulsion between outer-shell orbital electrons which prevents two wood blocks that are left on top of each other from coalescing into a single piece, but rather it is the exclusion principle applied to electrons and protons that generates the classical macroscopic [[normal force]]. In [[condensed matter physics]], Dyson also analysed the phase transition of the [[Ising model]] in 1 dimension and [[spin wave]]s.&lt;ref name=SelectedPapers&gt;F. J. Dyson, E. H. Lieb, ''Selected papers by Freeman Dyson'', AMS (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyson also did work in a variety of topics in mathematics, such as topology, analysis, number theory and [[Random matrix|random matrices]].&lt;ref name="SelectedPapers" /&gt; There is an interesting story involving random matrices. In 1973, the number theorist [[Hugh Montgomery (mathematician)|Hugh Montgomery]] was visiting the Institute for Advanced Study and had just made his [[Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture|pair correlation conjecture]] concerning the distribution of the zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]]. He showed his formula to the mathematician [[Atle Selberg]] who said it looked like something in [[mathematical physics]] and he should show it to Dyson, which he did. Dyson recognized the formula as the [[pair correlation function]] of the [[Gaussian unitary ensemble]], which has been extensively studied by physicists. This suggested that there might be an unexpected connection between the [[distribution of primes]] 2,3,5,7,11,&amp;nbsp; ... and the energy levels in the [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of [[heavy elements]] such as [[uranium]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Derbyshire]], ''[[Prime Obsession]]'', 2004, {{ISBN|0309085497}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1979, Dyson worked with the [[Oak Ridge Associated Universities|Institute for Energy Analysis]] on [[Climatology|climate studies]]. This group, under the direction of [[Alvin Weinberg]], pioneered multidisciplinary climate studies, including a strong biology group. Also during the 1970s, he worked on climate studies conducted by the [[JASON (advisory group)|JASON]] defense advisory group.&lt;ref name="civil" /&gt;

Dyson retired from the Institute for Advanced Study in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/podcasts/interviews/freeman-dyson.html|access-date=2011-12-19|title=InterViews Freeman Dyson|date=2004-07-23|publisher=[[National Academy of Sciences]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201035534/http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/podcasts/interviews/freeman-dyson.html|archive-date=1 December 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Dyson joined the board of the [[Solar Electric Light Fund]]. {{As of|2003}} he was president of the [[Space Studies Institute]], the space research organization founded by [[Gerard K. O'Neill]]; {{as of|2013}} he is on its Board of Trustees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ssi.org/about/ssi-officers-and-board/|title=Officers and Board|publisher=Space Studies Institute|access-date=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dyson is a long-time member of the [[JASON (advisory group)|JASON]] group.

Dyson has won numerous scientific awards but never a [[Nobel Prize]]. Nobel physics laureate [[Steven Weinberg]] has said that the [[Nobel Committee for Physics|Nobel committee]] has "fleeced" Dyson, but Dyson himself remarked in 2009, "I think it's almost true without exception if you want to win a Nobel Prize, you should have a long attention span, get hold of some deep and important problem and stay with it for ten years.

===Biotechnology and genetic engineering===
{{quote|My book ''[[The Sun, the Genome and the Internet|The Sun, the Genome, and the Internet]]'' (1999) describes a vision of green technology enriching villages all over the world and halting the migration from villages to megacities. The three components of the vision are all essential: the sun to provide energy where it is needed, the genome to provide plants that can convert sunlight into chemical fuels cheaply and efficiently, the Internet to end the intellectual and economic isolation of rural populations. With all three components in place, every village in Africa could enjoy its fair share of the blessings of civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F.

Dyson cheerfully admits his record as a prophet is mixed, but "it is better to be wrong than to be vague."&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F.J. (1999) ''The Sun, the Genome, and the Internet''&lt;/ref&gt;

"To answer the world's material needs, technology has to be not only beautiful but also cheap."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dyson, F.J.|1979}}. "The Greening of the Galaxy" in ''Disturbing the Universe''&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Origin of Life''===
Dyson favors the dual origin concept: Life first formed cells, then enzymes, and finally, much later, genes. This was first propounded by the Russian [[Alexander Oparin]].&lt;ref&gt;Oparin, A. I. ''The Origin of Life'', Moscow Worker publisher, 1924 (Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. B. S. Haldane]] developed the same theory independently.&lt;ref&gt;''The Origin of Life'', J.B.S.Haldane, The Rationalist Annual, 1929&lt;/ref&gt; Dyson has simplified things by saying simply that life evolved in two stages, widely separated in time. He regards it as too unlikely that genes could have developed fully blown in one process, because of the biochemistry. Current cells contain [[adenosine triphosphate]] or ATP and [[adenosine 5'-monophosphate]] or AMP, which greatly resemble each other but have completely different functions. ATP transports energy around the cell, and AMP is part of RNA and the genetic apparatus. Dyson proposes that in a primitive early cell containing ATP and AMP, RNA and replication were invented accidentally because of the similarity between AMP and RNA. He suggests that AMP was produced when ATP molecules lost two of their phosphate radicals, and then one cell somewhere performed [[Manfred Eigen|Eigen]]'s experiment and produced RNA.

Unfortunately there is no direct evidence for the dual origin concept, because once genes developed, they took over, obliterating all traces of the earlier forms of life. In the first origin, the cells were probably just drops of water held together by surface tension, teeming with enzymes and chemical reactions, and a primitive kind of growth or replication. When the liquid drop became too big, it split into two drops. Many complex molecules formed in these "little city economies" and the probability that genes would eventually develop in them was much greater than in the prebiotic environment.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman Dyson, ''Origins of Life,,. Second Edition'', Cambridge University Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Dyson rings.PNG|thumb|Artist's concept of Dyson rings, forming a stable [[Dyson Sphere#Dyson swarm|Dyson swarm]], or "Dyson sphere"]]

===Dyson sphere===
{{Main|Dyson sphere}}
{{quote|One should expect that, within a few thousand years of its entering the stage of industrial development, any intelligent species should be found occupying an artificial biosphere which completely surrounds its parent star.&lt;ref name=DavisInterview&gt;{{cite interview |subject= Freeman Dyson |url=http://www.omnimag.com/archives/interviews/dyson.html |title=Freeman Dyson: Imagine … |interviewer=Monte Davis |date=October 1978 |work=[[Omni (magazine)|OMNI]] |access-date=2006-12-17 |deadurl=usurped |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19981207065016/http://www.omnimag.com/archives/interviews/dyson.html |archivedate=1998-12-07 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1960, Dyson wrote a short paper for the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', titled "Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation| doi=10.1126/science.131.3414.1667| journal=Science| volume= 131| pages= 1667–1668| first=Freeman J.| last=Dyson| date=3 June 1960| issue=3414| pmid=17780673| bibcode= 1960Sci...131.1667D }}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he theorized that a technologically advanced [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial civilization]] might completely surround its native star with artificial structures in order to maximize the capture of the star's available energy. Eventually, the civilization would completely enclose the star, intercepting [[electromagnetic radiation]] with wavelengths from visible light downwards and radiating waste heat outwards as [[infrared]] radiation. Therefore, one method of [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|searching for extraterrestrial civilizations]] would be to look for large objects radiating in the infrared range of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].

Dyson conceived that such structures would be clouds of [[asteroid]]-sized [[space habitat]]s, though [[science fiction]] writers have preferred a solid structure: either way, such an artifact is often called a [[Dyson sphere]], although Dyson used the term "shell". Dyson says that he used the term "artificial biosphere" in the article meaning a habitat, not a shape.&lt;ref&gt;20 minutes into [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=350379535220823176&amp;q=genome a video]&lt;/ref&gt; The general concept of such an energy-transferring shell had been advanced decades earlier by author [[Olaf Stapledon]] in his 1937 novel ''[[Star Maker]]'', a source that Dyson has credited publicly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech | title = Living Through Four Revolutions |first = Freeman | last = Dyson | event = Perimeter Institute Public Lecture Series | location = Waterloo, Ontario, Canada | date = 1 June 2011 | url = https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/videos/living-through-four-revolutions }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dyson, F.J.|1979}}. ''Disturbing the Universe'', p. 211, "Some science fiction writers have wrongly given me the credit of inventing the artificial biosphere. In fact, I took the idea from Olaf Stapledon, one of their own colleagues"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dyson tree===
{{Main|Dyson tree}}

Dyson has also proposed the creation of a ''Dyson tree'', a [[genetic engineering|genetically-engineered]] plant capable of growing on a [[comet]]. He suggested that comets could be engineered to contain hollow spaces filled with a breathable atmosphere, thus providing self-sustaining habitats for humanity in the outer [[Solar System]].

{{quote|Plants could grow greenhouses ... just as turtles grow shells and polar bears grow fur and polyps build coral reefs in tropical seas. These plants could keep warm by the light from a distant Sun and conserve the oxygen that they produce by photosynthesis. The greenhouse would consist of a thick skin providing thermal insulation, with small transparent windows to admit sunlight. Outside the skin would be an array of simple lenses, focusing sunlight through the windows into the interior ... Groups of greenhouses could grow together to form extended habitats for other species of plants and animals.&lt;ref name=PlantsFish&gt;Dyson, FJ, "Warm-blooded plants and freeze-dried fish: the future of space exploration. Played" The Atlantic Monthly, November 1997 [https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/97nov/space.htm#Dyson Subscribers only]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Space colonies===
{{quote|I've done some historical research on the costs of the Mayflower's voyage, and on the Mormons' emigration to Utah, and I think it's possible to go into space on a much smaller scale. A cost on the order of $40,000 per person [1978 dollars, $143,254 in 2013 dollars] would be the target to shoot for; in terms of real wages, that would make it comparable to the colonization of America. Unless it's brought down to that level it's not really interesting to me, because otherwise it would be a luxury that only governments could afford.&lt;ref name=DavisInterview /&gt;}}

Dyson has been interested in space travel since he was a child, reading such [[science fiction]] classics as [[Olaf Stapledon]]'s ''[[Star Maker]]''. As a young man, he worked for [[General Atomics]] on the nuclear-powered [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Orion]] spacecraft. He hoped Project Orion would put men on Mars by 1965, Saturn by 1970. He's been unhappy for a quarter-century about how the government conducts space travel:
{{quote|The problem is, of course, that they can't afford to fail. The rules of the game are that you don't take a chance, because if you fail, then probably your whole program gets wiped out.&lt;ref name=DavisInterview /&gt;}}

He still hopes for cheap space travel, but is resigned to waiting for private entrepreneurs to develop something new and inexpensive.

{{quote|No law of physics or biology forbids cheap travel and settlement all over the solar system and beyond. But it is impossible to predict how long this will take. Predictions of the dates of future achievements are notoriously fallible. My guess is that the era of cheap unmanned missions will be the next fifty years, and the era of cheap manned missions will start sometime late in the twenty-first century.

Any affordable program of manned exploration must be centered in biology, and its time frame tied to the time frame of biotechnology; a hundred years, roughly the time it will take us to learn to grow warm-blooded plants, is probably reasonable.&lt;ref name=PlantsFish /&gt;}}

Dyson also proposed the use of bioengineered space colonies to colonize the Kuiper Belt on the outer edge of our Solar System. He proposed that habitats could be grown from space hardened spores. The colonies could then be warmed by large reflector plant leaves that could focus the dim, distant sunlight back on the growing colony. This was illustrated by Pat Rawlings on the cover of the National Space Society's Ad Astra magazine.

===Space exploration===
{{quote|A direct search for life in Europa's ocean would today be prohibitively expensive. Impacts on Europa give us an easier way to look for evidence of life there. Every time a major impact occurs on Europa, a vast quantity of water is splashed from the ocean into the space around Jupiter. Some of the water evaporates, and some condenses into snow. Creatures living in the water far enough from the impact have a chance of being splashed intact into space and quickly freeze-dried. Therefore, an easy way to look for evidence of life in Europa's ocean is to look for freeze-dried fish in the ring of space debris orbiting Jupiter.

Freeze-dried fish orbiting Jupiter is a fanciful notion, but nature in the biological realm has a tendency to be fanciful. Nature is usually more imaginative than we are. ... To have the best chance of success, we should keep our eyes open for all possibilities.&lt;ref name=PlantsFish /&gt;}}

===Dyson's eternal intelligence===
{{Main|Dyson's eternal intelligence}}
Dyson's proposal that intelligent beings may be capable of thinking an infinite number of thoughts in an open/ expanding universe.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman J. Dyson, [http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Global/Omega/dyson.txt "Time without end: Physics and biology in an open universe,"] ''Reviews of Modern Physics'', Vol. 51, Issue 3 (July 1979), pp. 447-460; {{doi|10.1103/RevModPhys.51.447}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dyson's transform===
{{Main|Dyson's transform}}
Dyson also has some credits in pure mathematics. His concept "Dyson's transform" led to one of the most important [[lemma (mathematics)|lemmas]] of [[Olivier Ramaré]]'s theorem that every even integer can be written as a sum of no more than six primes.

===Dyson series===
The [[Dyson series]], the formal solution of an explicitly time-dependent [[Schrödinger equation]] by iteration, and the corresponding Dyson time-ordering operator &lt;math&gt;\mathcal T\,,&lt;/math&gt; an entity of basic importance in the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics]], are also named after Dyson.

[[File:Freeman dyson.jpg|thumb|upright|Freeman Dyson in 2007 at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] ]]

===Quantum physics and prime numbers===
Dyson and [[Hugh Montgomery (mathematician)|Hugh Montgomery]] discovered together an intriguing connection between quantum physics and [[Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture]] about the zeros of the Zeta function. The primes 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, ... are described by the [[Riemann Zeta function]], and Dyson had previously developed a description of quantum physics based on m by m arrays of totally random numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dyson | first1 = Freeman J. | year = 1962 | title = A Brownian?Motion Model for the Eigenvalues of a Random Matrix | url = | journal = J. Math. Phys. | volume = 3 | issue = 6| page = 1191 | doi = 10.1063/1.1703862 |bibcode = 1962JMP.....3.1191D }}&lt;/ref&gt;  What Montgomery and Dyson discovered is that the ''[[eigenvalues]]'' of these matrices are spaced apart in exactly the same manner as Montgomery conjectured for the nontrivial zeros of the Zeta function. [[Andrew Odlyzko]] has verified the conjecture on a computer, using his  [[Odlyzko–Schönhage algorithm]] to calculate many zeros. Dyson recognized this connection because of a number-theory question Montgomery asked him. Dyson had published results in [[number theory]] in 1947, while a Fellow at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] and so was able to understand Montgomery's question. If Montgomery had not been visiting the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] that week, this connection might not have been discovered.

There are in nature one, two, and three dimensional [[quasicrystals]]. Mathematicians define a quasicrystal as a set of discrete points whose [[Fourier transform]] is also a set of discrete points. [[Andrew Odlyzko]] has done extensive computations of the Fourier transform of the nontrivial zeros of the [[Riemann Zeta function]], and they seem to form a one dimensional quasicrystal. This would in fact follow from the [[Riemann hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Freeman Dyson, Selected papers, 1990-2014, pp. 41–42, World Scientific, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==

===Metaphysics===
Dyson has suggested a kind of cosmic metaphysics of [[mind]]. In his book ''[[Infinite in All Directions]]'' he writes about three levels of mind: "The universe shows evidence of the operations of mind on three levels. The first level is the level of elementary physical processes in quantum mechanics. Matter in quantum mechanics is ... constantly making choices between alternative possibilities according to probabilistic laws. ... The second level at which we detect the operations of mind is the level of direct human experience. ... [I]t is reasonable to believe in the existence of a third level of mind, a mental component of the universe. If we believe in this mental component and call it God, then we can say that we are small pieces of God's mental apparatus" (p.&amp;nbsp;297).

===Climate change===
Dyson agrees that anthropogenic [[global warming]] exists. While he agrees that "[one] of the main causes of warming is the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere resulting from our burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal and natural gas",&lt;ref name="heretic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/dysonf07/dysonf07_index.html|publisher=Edge|title=Heretical Thoughts about Science and Society|date=8 August 2007|author=Freeman Dyson|access-date=2007-09-05}}dl&lt;/ref&gt; he believes that existing simulation models of climate fail to account for some important factors, and hence the results will contain too much error to reliably predict future trends:

{{quote|The models solve the equations of fluid dynamics, and they do a very good job of describing the fluid motions of the atmosphere and the oceans. They do a very poor job of describing the clouds, the dust, the chemistry and the biology of fields and farms and forests. They do not begin to describe the real world we live in&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name="heretic" /&gt;}}

and, in 2009:

{{quote|What has happened in the past 10 years is that the discrepancies between what's observed and what's predicted have become much stronger. It's clear now the models are wrong, but it wasn't so clear 10 years ago.&lt;ref name=dy8&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/10/11/freeman_dyson_interview/ "Top boffin Freeman Dyson on climate change, interstellar travel, fusion, and more"], interview published 2 June 2009 by [[The Register]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He is among signatories of a letter to the UN criticizing the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases-all?ID=d4b5fd23-802a-23ad-4565-3dce4095c360 |title=Don't fight, adapt |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |dead-url=yes |access-date=19 August 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911074152/http://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases-all?ID=d4b5fd23-802a-23ad-4565-3dce4095c360 |archivedate=11 September 2016 |df=dmy }} Open Letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

"[H]eretics who question the dogmas are needed&amp;nbsp; ... I am proud to be a heretic. The world always needs heretics to challenge the prevailing orthodoxies."&lt;ref name="heretic" /&gt;

Dyson says his views on global warming have been strongly criticized. In reply, he notes that "[m]y objections to the global warming propaganda are not so much over the technical facts, about which I do not know much, but it's rather against the way those people behave and the kind of intolerance to criticism that a lot of them have."&lt;ref name=e360&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090608114821/http://www.e360.yale.edu/content/feature.msp?id=2151 "Freeman Dyson Takes On The Climate Establishment"], interview published 2 June 2009 by [[Yale University]]'s ''Environment 360''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, he endorsed the now common usage of "global warming" as synonymous with global anthropogenic climate change, referring to "measurements that transformed global warming from a vague theoretical speculation into a precise observational science."&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F. (12 June 2008) [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/21494 "The Question of Global Warming"], The New York Review of Books. Retrieved on 2011-10-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has, however, argued that political efforts to reduce the causes of climate change distract from other global problems that should take priority:

{{quote|I'm not saying the warming doesn't cause problems, obviously it does. Obviously we should be trying to understand it. I'm saying that the problems are being grossly exaggerated. They take away money and attention from other problems that are much more urgent and important. Poverty, infectious diseases, public education and public health. Not to mention the preservation of living creatures on land and in the oceans.&lt;ref name="um"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831094244/http://www.umich.edu/news/index.html?DysonWinCom05|archivedate=31 August 2006 |url=http://www.umich.edu/news/index.html?DysonWinCom05|title= University of Michigan 2005 Winter Commencement Address|publisher=University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In an opinion piece in the Boston Globe of 3 Dec 2015 he wrote,

{{quote|[T]he environmental movement [has been] hijacked by a bunch of climate fanatics, who have captured the attention of the public with scare stories. ...

China and India have a simple choice to make. Either they get rich [by burning prodigious quantities of coal and causing] a major increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide, or they stay poor. I hope they choose to get rich. ...

The good news is that the main effect of carbon dioxide ... is to make the planet greener, [by] feeding the growth of green plants of all kinds [and] increasing the fertility of farms and fields and forests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dyson|first1=Freeman|title=Misunderstandings, questionable beliefs mar Paris climate talks|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2015/12/03/freeman-dyson-misunderstandings-questionable-beliefs-mar-paris-climate-talks/vG3oBrbmcZlv2m22DTNjMP/story.html|access-date=7 December 2015|publisher=''Boston Globe''|date=3 Dec 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Since originally taking interest in climate studies in the 1970s, Dyson has suggested that [[carbon dioxide]] levels in the atmosphere could be controlled by planting fast-growing trees. He calculates that it would take a trillion trees to remove all carbon from the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman J. Dyson, "Can we control the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere?", Energy, Volume 2, Issue 3, September 1977, Pages 287–291. {{doi|10.1016/0360-5442(77)90033-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="civil"/&gt;

In a 2014 interview, he said that "What I'm convinced of is that we don't understand climate ...  It will take a lot of very hard work before that question is settled."&lt;ref name=wired20140331&gt;

===Nuclear winter===
From his 1988 book ''[[Infinite in All Directions]]'', he offered some criticism of then current models predicting a devastating [[nuclear winter]] in the event of a large-scale nuclear war:

{{quote|As a scientist I want to rip the theory of nuclear winter apart, but as a human being I want to believe it.  This is one of the rare instances of a genuine conflict between the demands of science and the demands of humanity.  As a scientist, I judge the nuclear winter theory to be a sloppy piece of work, full of gaps and unjustified assumptions.  As a human being, I hope fervently that it is right.  Here is a real and uncomfortable dilemma.  What does a scientist do when science and humanity pull in opposite directions?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Freeman J. Dyson|title=Infinite in All Directions: Gifford Lectures Given at Aberdeen, Scotland April—November 1985|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ca3OH0a4tZoC&amp;pg=PA259|access-date=8 October 2011|date=22 July 2004|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-072889-2|pages=259–}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Warfare and weapons===

At the [[British Bomber Command]], Dyson and colleagues proposed removing two gun turrets from the RAF [[Lancaster bomber]]s, to cut the catastrophic losses due to German fighters in the [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|Battle of Berlin]]. A Lancaster without turrets could fly {{convert|50|mph|-1|abbr=on}} faster and be much more maneuverable.

{{quote|All our advice to the commander in chief [went] through the chief of our section, who was a career civil servant. His guiding principle was to tell the commander in chief things that the commander in chief liked to hear ... To push the idea of ripping out gun turrets, against the official mythology of the gallant gunner defending his crew mates ... was not the kind of suggestion the commander in chief liked to hear.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dyson, F.J.|1979}}. "The Children's Crusade" in ''Disturbing the Universe''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On hearing the news of the bombing of [[Hiroshima]]:

{{quote|I agreed emphatically with [[Henry Stimson]]. Once we had got ourselves into the business of bombing cities, we might as well do the job competently and get it over with. I felt better that morning than I had felt for years ... Those fellows who had built the atomic bombs obviously knew their stuff ... Later, much later, I would remember [the downside].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dyson, F.J.|1979}}. "The Blood of a Poet" in ''Disturbing the Universe''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|I am convinced that to avoid nuclear war it is not sufficient to be afraid of it. It is necessary to be afraid, but it is equally necessary to understand. And the first step in understanding is to recognize that the problem of nuclear war is basically not technical but human and historical. If we are to avoid destruction we must first of all understand the human and historical context out of which destruction arises.&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F.J. (1984) ''Weapons and Hope''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1967, in his capacity as a military adviser Dyson wrote an influential paper on the issue of possible US use of tactical nuclear weapons in the [[Vietnam War]]. When a general said in a meeting, "I think it might be a good idea to throw in a nuke now and then, just to keep the other side guessing ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dyson, F.J.|1979}}. "The Ethics of Defense" in ''Disturbing the Universe'', p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Dyson became alarmed and obtained permission to write an objective report discussing the pros and cons of using such weapons from a purely military point of view. (This report, ''Tactical Nuclear Weapons in Southeast Asia'', published by the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]], was obtained, with some redactions, by the [[Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainability]] under the [[Freedom of Information act]] in 2002.)&lt;ref&gt;F.J. Dyson, R. Gomer, S. Weinberg, S.C. Wright [http://nautilus.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/tactical_nukes_vietnam.pdf "Tactical Nuclear Weapons in Southeast Asia"] (March 1967) [declassified December 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; It was sufficiently objective that both sides in the debate based their arguments on it. Dyson says that the report showed that, even from a narrow military point of view, the US was better off not using nuclear weapons. Dyson stated on the [[Dick Cavett show]] that the use of nuclear weaponry was a bad idea for the US at the time because "our targets were large and theirs were small." (His unstated assumption was that the Soviets would respond by supplying tactical nukes to the other side.)

Dyson opposed the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Gulf War]] and the [[invasion of Iraq]]. He supported [[Barack Obama]] in the [[2008 US presidential election]] and ''[[The New York Times]]'' has described him as a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|political liberal]].&lt;ref name=civil /&gt; He was one of 29 leading US scientists who wrote a strongly supportive letter to Obama regarding his administration's 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.&lt;ref name = "29 support letter"&gt;{{Cite web | last = Broad | first = William J. | date = 8 August 2015 | title = 29 U.S. Scientists Praise Iran Nuclear Deal in Letter to Obama | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/world/29-us-scientists-praise-iran-nuclear-deal-in-letter-to-obama.html | work = The New York Times | access-date = 9 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil defence===
While teaching for a few weeks in Zurich, Dyson was visited by two officials from the Swiss civil defence authority. Their experts were telling them that fairly simple shelters on a large scale would enable them to survive a nuclear attack, and they wanted confirmation. They knew that Dyson had a security clearance. Dyson reassured them that their shelters would do the job. The US does not build such shelters because it would be contrary to the doctrine of [[mutual assured destruction]], since the US would be able to launch a first strike but survive retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F.J. (1984) "Shelters" in ''Weapons and Hope''&lt;/ref&gt;

===The role of failure===
{{quote|You can't possibly get a good technology going without an enormous number of failures. It's a universal rule. If you look at [[bicycles]], there were thousands of weird models built and tried before they found the one that really worked. You could never design a bicycle theoretically. Even now, after we've been building them for 100 years, it's very difficult to understand just why a bicycle works – it's even difficult to formulate it as a mathematical problem. But just by trial and error, we found out how to do it, and the error was essential.&lt;ref name=BrandInterview&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.02/dyson.html?pg=7&amp;topic=&amp;topic_set= Interview by Stewart Brand, February 1998].

===On English academics===
{{quote|My view of the prevalence of doom-and-gloom in [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] is that it is a result of the English class system.  In England there were always two sharply opposed middle classes, the academic middle class and the commercial middle class. In the nineteenth century, the academic middle class won the battle for power and status.  As a child of the academic middle class, I learned to look on the commercial middle class with loathing and contempt.  Then came the triumph of [[Margaret Thatcher]], which was also the revenge of the commercial middle class.  The academics lost their power and prestige and the business people took over. The academics never forgave Thatcher and have been gloomy ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staff.livjm.ac.uk/spsbpeis/Freeman-Dyson.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703082513/http://www.staff.livjm.ac.uk/spsbpeis/Freeman-Dyson.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 July 2007|

===Science and religion===
He is a [[Nondenominational Christianity|nondenominational Christian]] and has attended various churches from [[Presbyterian]] to [[Roman Catholic]]. Regarding doctrinal or [[Christological]] issues, he has said, "I am neither a saint nor a theologian. To me, good works are more important than theology."&lt;ref name="edge68.html"&gt;{{cite speech |url=https://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge68.html |author= Freeman Dyson |event=Templeton Prize Lecture |title=Progress In Religion |via=[[Edge.org]] |date=15 March 2000 |access-date=2011-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Science and religion are two windows that people look through, trying to understand the big universe outside, trying to understand why we are here. The two windows give different views, but they look out at the same universe. Both views are one-sided, neither is complete. Both leave out essential features of the real world. And both are worthy of respect.

Trouble arises when either science or religion claims universal jurisdiction, when either religious or scientific dogma claims to be infallible. Religious creationists and scientific materialists are equally dogmatic and insensitive. By their arrogance they bring both science and religion into disrepute. The media exaggerate their numbers and importance. The media rarely mention the fact that the great majority of religious people belong to moderate denominations that treat science with respect, or the fact that the great majority of scientists treat religion with respect so long as religion does not claim jurisdiction over scientific questions.&lt;ref name="edge68.html" /&gt;}}

Dyson partially disagrees with the famous remark by his fellow physicist [[Steven Weinberg]] that "With or without religion, good people can behave well and bad people can do evil; but for good people to do evil—that takes religion."&lt;ref name="nyrb06.html"&gt;{{cite web |title=Religion from the Outside |author=Freeman Dyson |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/19090 |date=22 June 2006 |work=The New York Review of Books |access-date=2011-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Weinberg's statement is true as far as it goes, but it is not the  whole truth. To make it the whole truth, we must add an additional clause: "And for bad people to do good things—that [also] takes religion." The main point of Christianity is that it is a religion for sinners. Jesus made that very clear. When the Pharisees asked his disciples, "Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?" he said, "I come to call not the righteous but sinners to repentance." Only a small fraction of sinners repent and do good things but only a small fraction of good people are led by their religion to do bad things.&lt;ref name="nyrb06.html" /&gt;}}

While Dyson has labeled himself a Christian, he identifies himself as agnostic about some of the specifics of his faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Back to Hell |publisher=Xulon Press |isbn=9781591608158 |author=Moses Gbenu |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R8aLHpyW7vEC&amp;pg=PA110#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=110 |quote=The cash part of this award is over $1 million.

{{quote|I am myself a Christian, a member of a community that preserves an ancient heritage of great literature and great music, provides help and counsel to young and old when they are in trouble, educates children in moral responsibility, and worships God in its own fashion. But I find Polkinghorne's theology altogether too narrow for my taste. I have no use for a theology that claims to know the answers to deep questions but bases its arguments on the beliefs of a single tribe. I am a practicing Christian but not a believing Christian. To me, to worship God means to recognize that mind and intelligence are woven into the fabric of our universe in a way that altogether surpasses our comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Science &amp; Religion: No Ends in Sight |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2002/mar/28/science-religion-no-ends-in-sight/ |work=The New York Review of Books|access-date=30 July 2012|author=Freeman Dyson|date=28 March 2002|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''[[The God Delusion]]'' (2006), biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] criticized Dyson for accepting the religious [[Templeton Prize]] in 2000; "It would be taken as an endorsement of religion by one of the world's most distinguished physicists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The God Delusion |last=Dawkins|first=Richard|publisher=[[Bantam Press]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-61868-000-9|page=152|title-link=The God Delusion}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dyson declared in 2000 that he is a (non-denominational) Christian,&lt;ref name="edge68.html"/&gt; and he has disagreed with Dawkins on several occasions, as when he criticized Dawkins' understanding of [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=John Brockman |url=http://www.edge.org/discourse/dawkins_dyson.html |title=Richard Dawkins—Freeman Dyson: an exchange |year=2007 |website=[[Edge.org]]|access-date=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5959">'''Frege's puzzles''' are puzzles about the [[semantics]] of [[proper name]]s, although related puzzles also arise in the case of [[indexical]]s. [[Gottlob Frege]] (1848–1925) introduced the puzzle at the beginning of his article "Über Sinn und Bedeutung" ("[[On Sense and Reference]]") in 1892 in one of the most influential articles in [[analytic philosophy]] and [[philosophy of language]].

==The puzzles ==

The term "Frege's puzzle" is commonly applied to two related problems.  One is a problem about identity statements that Frege raised at the beginning of "On Sense and Reference", and another concerns propositional attitude reports.&lt;ref&gt;Zalta, Edward N., "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/frege/ Gottlob Frege]", ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (Fall 2014), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;  For the first problem, consider the following two sentences:

(1) [[Hesperus]] is Hesperus.

(2) Hesperus is [[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphorus]].

Each of these sentences is true, since 'Hesperus' refers to the same object as 'Phosphorus' (the planet Venus). Nonetheless, (1) and (2) seem to differ in their meaning or what Frege called "cognitive value". (1) is just a truth of logic that can be known [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]], whereas (2) records an empirical truth that was discovered by astronomers. The problem, however, is that proper names are often taken to have no meaning beyond their reference (a view often associated with [[John Stuart Mill]]). But this seems to imply that the two statements mean the same thing, or have the same cognitive value.&lt;ref&gt;Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2017). Lexemes, practs, and those who have yet to decide. Linguistik Online, 81, 77-93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2018). Which view of indirect reports do Persian data corroborate? International Review of Pragmatics, 10(1), 76-100. &lt;/ref&gt;

Frege proposed to resolve this puzzle by postulating a second level of meaning besides reference in the form of what he called [[Sense and reference|sense]]: a difference in the mode of presentation or the way an object can be "given" to us.  Thus 'Hesperus' and 'Phosphorus' have the same reference, but differ in sense because they present Venus in different ways.

The second puzzle concerns [[propositional attitude]] reports, such as belief reports.  Ordinarily, coreferring names are substitutable [[salva veritate]], that is, without change in truth value.  For example, if 'Hesperus is bright' is true then 'Phosphorus is bright' is also true given that 'Hesperus' and 'Phosphorus' refer to the same planet.  But now consider the following argument:

(3) Alex believes Hesperus is visible in the evening.

(4) Hesperus = Phosphorus.

(5) Alex believes Phosphorus is visible in the evening.

This argument appears to be [[Validity (logic)|invalid]]: even if (3) and (4) are true, (5) could be false.  If Alex is not aware that Hesperus and Phosphorus are the same planet, then it seems that he could believe that Hesperus is visible in the evening while rejecting the claim that Phosphorus is visible in the evening (perhaps he thinks Phosphorus, the morning star, is only visible in the morning).  The principle that coreferring names are substitutable ''salva veritate'' thus appears to fail in the context of belief reports (and similarly for other propositional attitude reports).

Frege again proposed to solve this problem by appeal to his distinction between sense and reference.  In particular, he held that when a proper name occurs in the context of an attitude report, its reference shifts to its ordinary sense: thus 'Phosphorus', for example, denotes the planet Venus when it occurs in the sentence 'Phosphorus is visible in the evening' or in an identity sentence like (4), but when it occurs embedded in an attitude report like (5) it denotes its ordinary ''sense.''

==New theories of reference and the return of Frege's puzzle==

Frege's puzzle has received a great deal of attention since the attacks on the [[descriptivist theory of names]] mounted in the 1970s and 1980s by philosophers such as [[Keith Donnellan]], [[Saul Kripke]], [[Ruth Barcan Marcus]], [[Hilary Putnam]], and [[David Kaplan (philosopher)|David Kaplan]].&lt;ref&gt;Cumming, S. "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/names/ Names]", ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the wake of these attacks on descriptivism, many philosophers embraced the Millian or direct-reference view of proper names, according to which the meaning of a name is simply its referent. As noted above, this Millian view has the result that (1) and (2) express the same proposition.  Similarly, the embedded sentences 'Hesperus is visible in the evening' and 'Phosphorus is visible in the evening' from (3) and (5) express the same proposition.  It therefore looks like (3) and (5) cannot differ in truth value since they attribute belief in one and the same proposition.

In view of this problem, many philosophers of language have attempted to work out a solution to the puzzle within the confines of direct-reference theories of proper names. Some of these philosophers include [[Nathan Salmon]] (e.g. in ''Frege's puzzle'' and ''Content, Cognition, and Communication''), [[Howard Wettstein]] (e.g. in "Has Semantics Rested on a Mistake?"), [[Scott Soames]], [[David Kaplan (philosopher)|David Kaplan]], [[John Perry (philosopher)|John Perry]] (e.g. in ''Reference and Reflexivity''), and [[Joseph Almog]].

'''''Gestell''''' (or sometimes '''''Ge-stell''''') is a [[German language|German]] word used by twentieth-century German [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Martin Heidegger]] to describe what lies behind or beneath modern [[technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

It was derived from the root word ''stellen'', which means "to put" or "to place" and combined with the German prefix ''Ge-'', which denotes a form of "gathering" or "collection".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heidegger on Technology|last=Wendland|first=Aaron|last2=Merwin|first2=Christopher|last3=Hadjioannou|first3=Christos|publisher=Routledge|year=2018|isbn=9781138674615|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term gathers together all kinds of entities and orders them in a certain way.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

==Heidegger's notion of ''Gestell''==
Heidegger applied the concept of ''Gestell'' to his exposition of the [[essence]] of [[technology]]. He concluded that technology is fundamentally '''Enframing''' (''Gestell'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

As such, the essence of technology is ''Gestell''. Indeed, "''Gestell'', literally 'framing', is an all-encompassing view of technology, not as a means to an end, but rather a mode of [[human]] [[existence]]".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.regent.edu/acad/schcom/rojc/mdic/martin1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060110153844/http://www.regent.edu/acad/schcom/rojc/mdic/martin1.html |archivedate=2006-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such enframing pertains to the manner reality appears or unveils itself in the period of modern technology and people born into this "mode of ordering" are always embedded into the Gestell (enframing).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gendered Bodies and New Technologies: Rethinking Embodiment in a Cyber-era|last=du Preez|first=Amanda|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2009|isbn=9781443813235|location=Newcastle upon Tyne, UK|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In defining the essence of technology as ''Gestell'', Heidegger indicated that all that has come to presence in the world has been enframed. Thus what is revealed in the world, what has shown itself as itself (the truth of itself) required first an Enframing, literally a way to exist in the world, to be able to be seen and understood. Concerning the essence of technology and how we see things in our technological age, the world has been framed as the "standing-reserve." Heidegger writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Enframing means the gathering together of that setting-upon which sets upon man, i.e., challenges him forth, to reveal the real, in the mode of ordering, as standing-reserve. Enframing means that way of revealing which holds sway in the essence of modern technology and which is itself nothing technological.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''The Question Concerning Technology and Other Essays'' (New York: Harper, 1977), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, Heidegger uses the word in a way that is uncommon by giving ''Gestell'' an active role. In ordinary usage the word would signify simply a display apparatus of some sort, like a book rack, or picture frame; but for Heidegger, ''Gestell'' is literally a challenging forth, or ''perform''ative "gathering together", for the purpose of revealing or presentation. If applied to science and modern technology, "standing reserve" is active in the case of a river once it generates electricity or the earth if revealed as a coal-mining district or the soil as a mineral deposit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heidegger and the Work of Art History|last=Boetzkes|first=Amanda|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781409456131|location=Oxon|pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For some scholars, Gestell effectively explains the violence of technology. This is attributed to Heidegger's explanation that, when Gestell holds sway, "it drives out every other possibility of revealing" and that it "conceals that revealing which, in the sense of ''[[poiesis]]'', lets what presences come forth into appearance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heidegger's Later Philosophy|last=Young|first=Julian|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=0521809223|location=Cambridge|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A term coined by [[Karl Popper]] in his work ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' to denote what he regarded as the main problem of [[methodology]] and the [[philosophy of science]], i.e. to explain and promote the further growth of scientific knowledge. To this purpose, Popper advocated his theory of [[falsifiability]], [[testability]] and testing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prb.org 3 Population Bulletin Vol. 61, No. 2 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''heuristic argument''' is an [[argument]] that reasons from the value of a method or principle that has been shown by experimental (especially [[trial-and-error]]) investigation to be a useful aid in learning, discovery and [[problem-solving]]. A widely used and important example of a [[heuristic]] argument is [[Occam's Razor]].

It is a speculative, non-rigorous argument, that relies on an analogy or on intuition, that allows one to achieve a result or approximation to be checked later with more rigor; otherwise the results are of doubt. It is used as a hypothesis or conjecture in an investigation. It can also be used as a mnemonic.&lt;ref name="BrodskyEllis1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brodsky|first1=Stanley J.|last2=Ellis|first2=John|last3=Karliner|first3=Marek|title=Chiral symmetry and the spin of the proton|journal=Physics Letters B|volume=206|issue=2|year=1988|pages=309–315|doi=10.1016/0370-2693(88)91511-0|url=http://www.slac.stanford.edu/cgi-wrap/getdoc/slac-pub-4519.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]], '''hyle''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|aɪ|l|iː}}; from {{lang-grc|ὕλη}}) refers to [[Matter (philosophy)|matter]] or stuff.  It can also be the [[material cause]] underlying a change in [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] philosophy. The Greeks originally had no word for matter in general, as opposed to raw material suitable for some specific purpose or other, so Aristotle adapted the word for "wood" to this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, James Morris Whiton, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nxoyBcpUuEsC&amp;lpg=PA829&amp;ots=xudfug-SqS&amp;dq=liddell%20and%20scott%20hyle&amp;pg=PA725#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''A lexicon abridged from Liddell &amp; Scott's Greek-English lexicon''] (New York: Harper and Brothers, 1891), 725.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that everything physical is made of the same basic substance holds up well under modern [[science]], although it may be thought of more in terms of [[energy]] or matter/energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Nature of Physical Existence|first=Ivor|last= Leclerc|publisher=Routledge|year= 2004|ISBN=0-415-29561-0|pages=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Substance==

The matter of hyle is closely related to that of [[substance theory|substance]], in so far as both endure a change in form, or transformation. Aristotle defined primary substance as that which can neither be predicated nor attributed to something else,&lt;ref name="sep-substance"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Howard |last=Robinson |editor=Edward N. Zalta |year=2009 |title=Substance |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Winter 2009 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2009/entries/substance/#AriAccSub}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he explained the transformation between the [[classical elements|four terrestrial elements]] in terms of an abstract primary matter that underlies each element due to the four combinations of two properties: hot or cold and wet or dry. He stipulated that transformations between opposing elements, where both properties differ, must be analyzed as two discrete steps wherein one of the two properties changes to its contrary while the other remains unchanged (see [[essence]] and [[hylomorphism]]).

Modern substance theory differs, for example [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s "Ding an sich", or "[[thing in itself]]", is generally described as whatever is its own cause, or alternatively as a thing whose only property is that it is that thing (or, in other words, that it has only that property). However, this notion is subject to the criticism, as by [[Nietzsche]], that there is no way to ''directly'' prove the existence of any thing which has no properties, since such a thing could not possibly interact with other things and thus would be unobservable and [[indeterminacy in philosophy|indeterminate]].

On the other hand, we may need to postulate a substance that [[endurantism|endures]] through change in order to explain the nature of change—without an enduring factor that persists through change, there is no change but only a succession of unrelated [[event (philosophy)|event]]s. The existence of change is hard to deny, and if we have to postulate something ''unobserved'' in order to explain what ''is'' observed, that is a valid ''indirect'' demonstration (by [[abductive reasoning]]). Moreover, something like a prime substance is posited by [[physics]] in the form of [[matter]]/[[energy]].

'''''Idios kosmos''''' comes from Greek and means private world. It exists with, and is opposite to, '''''koinos kosmos''''' (shared world). ''Idios kosmos'' is the view of the world that is developed from personal experience and knowledge and is therefore unique; however, it can be difficult to tell the difference between it and ''koinos kosmos''.

The two phrases come from the [[Diels–Kranz numbering system|Diels-Kranz]] fragment B89 of [[Heraclitus]]: ὁ Ἡράκλειτός φησι τοῖς ἐγρηγορόσιν ἕνα καὶ κοινὸν κόσμον εἶναι τῶν δὲ κοιμωμένων ἕκαστον εἰς ἴδιον ἀποστρέφεσθαι  ("Heraclitus said that the waking have one common world, but the sleeping turn aside each into a world of his own.")

The idea of ''idios kosmos'' is an important part of [[Philip K. Dick]]'s views on [[schizophrenia]], as expressed in his 1964 essay "Schizophrenia &amp; 'The Book of Changes'", drawing on personal experience with the [[I Ching]].

      <comment>Hard incompatibilism is the "bad" thing here, not giving up belief in it (what Smilansky endorses).</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5259">'''Illusionism''' is a [[metaphysics|metaphysical theory]] first propounded by professor Saul Smilansky of the [[University of Haifa]].  It holds that people have illusory beliefs about [[free will]].{{sfn|Kane|2011|p=26}}  Furthermore, it holds that it is both of key importance and morally right that people not be disabused of these beliefs, because the illusion has benefits both to individuals and to society.{{sfn|Kane|2011|p=26}}{{sfn|Holroyd|2010|p=110}}  Belief in [[hard incompatibilism]], argues Smilansky, removes an individual's basis for a sense of self-worth in his or her own achievements.  It is "extremely damaging to our view of ourselves, to our sense of achievement, worth, and self-respect".{{sfn|Pereboom|2008|p=472}}

Neither compatibilism nor hard determinism are the whole story, according to Smilansky, and there exists an ''ultimate perspective'' in which ''some'' parts of compatibilism are valid and ''some'' parts of hard determinism are valid.{{sfn|Lenman|2002|p=4}}  However, Smilansky asserts, the nature of what he terms the ''fundamental dualism'' between hard determinism and compatibilism is a morally undesirable one, in that both beliefs, in their absolute forms, have adverse consequences.  The distinctions between choice and luck made by compatibilism are important, but wholly undermined by hard determinism.  But, conversely, hard determinism undermines the morally important notions of justice and respect, leaving them nothing more than "shallow" notions.{{sfn|Lenman|2002|p=6}}

Smilansky's thesis is considered a radical one,{{sfn|Kane|2011|p=26}} and other philosophers disagree with it.  Professor [[Derk Pereboom (philosopher)|Derk Pereboom]] of Cornell University, for example, disagrees that hard incompatibilism necessarily does away with self-worth, because to a large extent that sense of self-worth isn't related to will at all, let alone to free will.  Aspects of worthiness such as natural beauty, native physical ability, and intelligence are not voluntary.{{sfn|Pereboom|2008|p=472}}  Professor James Lenman of the University of Glasgow (at the time) takes a similar line, arguing that Smilansky's expression of the problems is overstated.  The problems that he presents are less fundamentally metaphysical than simply practical in nature.{{sfn|Lenman|2002|p=15–17}}

{{For|the Star Trek: Voyager episode|Infinite Regress (Star Trek: Voyager)}}
An '''infinite regress''' in a series of [[proposition]]s arises if the [[truth]] of proposition ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; requires the support of proposition ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the truth of proposition ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; requires the support of proposition ''P''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and so on, [[ad infinitum]].

Distinction is made between infinite regresses that are "[[vicious circle|vicious]]" and those that are not.

==Aristotle==
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|Aristotle]]
[[Aristotle]] argued that knowing does not necessitate an infinite regress because some knowledge does not depend on demonstration:
{{quote|Some hold that, owing to the necessity of knowing the primary premises, there is no scientific knowledge. Others think there is, but that all truths are demonstrable. Neither doctrine is either true or a necessary deduction from the premises. The first school, assuming that there is no way of knowing other than by demonstration, maintain that an infinite regress is involved, on the ground that if behind the prior stands no primary, we could not know the posterior through the prior (wherein they are right, for one cannot traverse an infinite series): if on the other hand – they say – the series terminates and there are primary premises, yet these are unknowable because incapable of demonstration, which according to them is the only form of knowledge. And since thus one cannot know the primary premises, knowledge of the conclusions which follow from them is not pure scientific knowledge nor properly knowing at all, but rests on the mere supposition that the premises are true. The other party agree with them as regards knowing, holding that it is only possible by demonstration, but they see no difficulty in holding that all truths are demonstrated, on the ground that demonstration may be circular and reciprocal.

Our own doctrine is that not all knowledge is demonstrative: on the contrary, knowledge of the immediate premises is independent of demonstration. (The necessity of this is obvious; for since we must know the prior premises from which the demonstration is drawn, and since the regress must end in immediate truths, those truths must be indemonstrable.) Such, then, is our doctrine, and in addition we maintain that besides scientific knowledge there is its original source which enables us to recognize the definitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Patrick Hugh |last=Byrne |year=1997 |title=Analysis &amp; Science in Aristotle |series=SUNY Series in Ancient Greek Philosophy |publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=9780791433218 |lccn=96037783 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=grx6qfb5L7AC&amp;pg=PA83 |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1901 |author=Aristotle |title=Posterior Analytics |publisher=B.H.

==Consciousness==
Infinite regress in [[consciousness]] is the formation of an infinite series of "inner observers" as we ask the question of who is observing the output of the [[neural correlates of consciousness]] in the study of [[subjective consciousness]].

==Optics==
[[File:Blond infinite reflections.jpg|thumb|Infinite reflections between two mirrors]]
Infinite regress is akin to the [[optics|optical]] phenomenon wherein an infinite sequence of receding images is formed between two [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] facing [[mirror]]s. A similar process occurs in [[optical feedback]].
{{-}}

==Libertarian free will==
[[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|Libertarian free will]] asserts that human actions do not have causes and are chosen [[Consciousness|consciously]] – i.e. are not random. This raises a serious question: what are these conscious decisions based on? Since they can't be based on nothing (as the possibility of decisions being random is excluded), this question can be asked for each subsequent answer or answers to it, thus forming an infinite regress.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20070825055350/http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/papq.12139/full&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=t0PZ3yjTuX0C&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;dq=libertarianism+infinite+regress&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Qla6LiOZCx&amp;sig=nOLQZbiz-rCuY0ROOBrUu0rmTt4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjU55LF-5XXAhXCYVAKHQ-LB8kQ6AEITzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=libertarianism%20infinite%20regress&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2594">'''Interpretivism''' is a school of thought in contemporary [[jurisprudence]] and the [[philosophy of law]]. 

==Overview==
[[File:Ronald Dworkin at the Brooklyn Book Festival.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ronald Dworkin]] is often associated with interpretivism.]]
The main claims of interpretivism are that 
*Law is not a set of given data, [[Convention (norm)|conventions]] or physical facts, but what [[lawyer]]s aim to construct or obtain in their [[Practice_of_law|practice]]. This marks a first difference between interpretivism and [[legal positivism]]. But the refusal that law be a set of ''given'' entities opposes interpretivism to [[natural law]] too.
*There is no separation between law and [[morality]], although there are differences. This is not in accordance with the main claim of legal positivism.
*Law is not [[Immanence|immanent]] in nature nor do legal values and principles exist independently and outside of the legal practice itself. This is the opposite of the main claim of natural law theory.

In the [[English language|English]] speaking world, interpretivism is usually identified with [[Ronald Dworkin]]'s thesis on the nature of [[law]] as discussed in his text titled ''[[Law's Empire]]'', which is sometimes seen as a third way between natural law and legal positivism. 

The concept also includes continental [[legal hermeneutics]] and authors such as [[Helmut Coing]] and [[Emilio Betti]]. Legal hermeneutics can be seen as a branch of philosophical [[hermeneutics]], whose main authors in the 20th century are [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]], both drawing on [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl's]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. Hermeneutics has now expanded to many varied areas of research in the [[social sciences]] as an alternative to a conventionalist approach.

In a wider sense, interpretivism includes even the theses of, in chronological order, [[Josef Esser]], [[Theodor Viehweg]], [[Chaim Perelman]], [[Wolfgang Fikentscher]], [[António Castanheira Neves|Castanheira Neves]], [[Friedrich Müller (jurist)|Friedrich Müller]], [[Aulis Aarnio]] and [[Robert Alexy]].

'''Julio Cabrera''' is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] living in [[Brazil]]. He is a retired professor of the Department of Philosophy at the University of Brasília and former head of the department. Previously he taught in Argentina, at the National University of Córdoba, the University of Belgrano and then in Brazil at the Federal University of Santa Maria. Currently, he is a senior associate researcher, by invitation, in the Bioethics Doctoral Program of the University of Brasília. He is best known for his works on "negative ethics" and cinema and philosophy. Other areas of philosophy that he deals with are philosophy of language, logic and Latin American philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://issuu.com/fundacionjaimeroca/docs/juliocabrera] ''Entrevista al Dr. Julio Cabrera'', Serie Entrevistas, Fundación Dr. Jaime Roca, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihuonline.unisinos.br/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4175] ''Sem grandes intuiçoes, nao há grande filosofia'', Instituto Humanitas Unisinos, number 379, November 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/preview.do?metodo=apresentar&amp;id=K4781131E6] Biogram on Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://philosopherjuliocabrera.blogspot.com/2011/05/who-i-am.html] J. Cabrera, ''Who I am''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Negative ethics ==

In his book ''A Critique of Affirmative Morality (A reflection on Death, Birth and the Value of Life)''&lt;ref&gt;[http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/17430/3/Livro_CritiqueAffirmativeMorality.pdf] J. Cabrera, ''A critique of affirmative morality (A reflection on death, birth and the value of life)'', Brasília: Julio Cabrera Editions, 2014 (English edition). J. Cabrera, ''Crítica de la moral afirmativa: Una reflexión sobre nacimiento, muerte y valor de la vida'', Barcelona: Gedisa, 1996 (original Spanish edition).&lt;/ref&gt;, Julio Cabrera presents his theory about the value of human existence. Human life, for Cabrera, is "structurally negative" in that its constitutive components are inherently adverse: as prominent among them Cabrera cites loss, scarcity, [[pain]], conflicts, fragility, [[illness]], [[aging]], [[boredom]] and [[death]]. According to Cabrera they form the basic structure to human life, which he analyzes through what he calls [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], drawing freely from thinkers such as [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. Cabrera has called his work an attempt to put together Schopenhauer and Heidegger, introducing a determinant judgement of the value of Being into the analysis of [[Dasein]], and putting morality above life, against Nietzsche. 

Cabrera develops an ethical theory, negative ethics, that is informed by this phenomenological analysis. He argues that there has been an unwarranted prejudice in ethics against non-Being, a view he calls "affirmativity". Because affirmative views take Being as good, they always view things that threaten this hegemony as bad; particularly things like abstention from [[procreation]] or [[suicide]]. Cabrera criticizes affirmative ethics for asking how people should live without asking the radical question of whether people should live tout court. He argues that, because of the structural negativity of Being, there is a fundamental "moral disqualification" of human beings due to the impossibility of nonharming and nonmanipulating others. Nonharming and nonmanipulating others is called by him the "fundamental ethical articulation" ("FEA"). The FEA is violated by our structural "moral impediment", by the worldly discomforts – notably pain and discouragement – imposed on us that prevent us from acting ethically. Cabrera argues that an affirmative morality is a self-contradiction because it conceives a human existence that precludes the possibility of not-harming or not-manipulating others. Thus he believes that affirmative societies, through their politics, require the common suspension of the FEA to even function.

As a response to the negative structure of Being, Cabrera's negative ethics is acutely aware of the morally disqualifying nature of Being. Cabrera believes children are usually considered as mere aesthetic objects, are not created for their own sake but for the sake of their parents, and are thrown into a structurally negative life by the act of procreation. Procreation is, as Cabrera argues, a supreme act of manipulation, a harm  and a violation of autonomy. He argues that the consistent application of normal moral concepts – like duty, virtue or respect – present in most affirmative moralities entails [[antinatalism]]. Cabrera also believes that a human being adopting negative ethics should not only abstain from procreation, but also should have a complete willingness for an ethical death, by immediate suspension of all personal projects in benefit of a political fight&lt;ref name=autoname1&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Políticas negativas y ética de la libertación. ¿Es posible ser um pessimista revolucionário? (Mi encuentro con Enrique Dussel)'', Essay 9 in: ''Análisis y existencia: pensamiento en travesía'', Córdoba: Ediciones del Copista, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; or an altruistic suicide, when it becomes the least immoral course of action.

Cabrera’s ''Critique'' is one of his most systematic defenses of negative ethics, but he has also explored the same ideas in other works, such as ''Projeto de Ética Negativa''&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Projeto de Ética Negativa'', São Paulo: Mandacaru, 1989 (second edition: ''A Ética e Suas Negações, Não nascer, suicídio e pequenos assassinatos'', Rio De Janeiro: Rocco, 2011).

Cabrera, ''Mal-estar e moralidade: situação humana, ética e procriação responsável'', Brasília: UnB, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cinema and philosophy ==

In his first book about cinema-philosophical thought, ''Cine, 100 anos de filosofia: Una Introducción a la Filosofia A Traves del Análisis de Películas''&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Cine, 100 años de filosofia: Una Introducción a la Filosofia A Traves del Análisis de Películas'', Barcelona: Gedisa, 1999 (second edition in 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;, Julio Cabrera proposes the notion of "logopathy" (from Greek: "logos" – "reason" and "páthos" – "feelings"), that is, of "cognitive-affective concepts", treating them as capable of putting in question the traditional view of philosophy about concepts, which he calls apathetic and tied to purely [[intellectualism|intellectual]] concepts. Cabrera sustains that logopathic philosophy is of the order of meaning, and not of truth, and that it adds affective elements of judgment to these traditional intellectual view of concepts. 

Cabrera considers cinema one of the most fruitful means for the generation of concepts of a logopathic type, specifically denominated by him as "concept-image", as opposed to "concept-idea", the apathetic type of concept. He believes that cinema, by its powerful audiovisual means of expression, would provide a "superpotentiation" of conceptual possibilities, and therefore, of the establishment of the experience of the film, indispensable to the development of the concept-image, with the consequent increase of affective impact.

On the other hand, Cabrera believes that throughout history of European philosophy, at various moments, written philosophy – the opposite of visual philosophy – has also been logopathic, it has thought through affections, but without assuming it openly, while cinema usually has been seen only as a mere affective phenomenon, without relevant cognitive power. His notions of logopathy and concept-image seek to eliminate this dichotomy, pointing to the affectivity of the intellect and the cognitiveness of affections.
 
Cabrera gave continuity to the exposition of his cinema-philosophy thinking in books like ''De Hitchcock a Greenaway pela história da filosofia: novas reflexoes sobre cinema e filosofia''&lt;ref&gt;[http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/15246/1/LIVRO_HitchcockGreenawaypelahistoria.pdf] J. Cabrera, ''De Hitchcock a Greenaway pela história da filosofia: novas reflexoes sobre cinema e filosofia'', São Paulo: Nankin, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; (a sort of second volume of ''Cine: 100 anos de filosofia'') and  ''Diálogo/cinema''&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, M. Tiburi, ''Diálogo/cinema'', São Paulo: Senac, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;, where in a debate through letters with Marcia Tiburi, he discusses the subject from the perspective that, long before the invention of the cinema, philosophy was already "filming" ideas through images, and also in articles ''Para una des-comprensión filosófica Del cine: el caso Inland Empire de David Lynch''&lt;ref&gt;[https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=3003168] J. Cabrera, ''Para una des-comprensión filosófica Del cine: el caso Inland Empire de David Lynch'', Enl@ce, year 6, number 2, Maracaibo: Universidad del Zulia, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;, ''Três ensaios sobre a repetição: Kierkegaard, Jarmush, Hitchcock, Van Sant e três damas que desembarcam antes de chegar (Uma reflexão transversal sobre escrita e imagem)''&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Três ensaios sobre a repetição: Kierkegaard, Jarmush, Hitchcock, Van Sant e três damas que desembarcam antes de chegar (Uma reflexão transversal sobre escrita e imagem)'', in: Ri. Timm De Souza et alia, ''Literatura e Cinema. Encontros contemporâneos'', Porto Alegre: Dublinense, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;, ''Existencia naufragada. Los 4 viajes del Titanic''&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Existencia naufragada. Los 4 viajes del Titanic'', Per la Filosofia, Pisa-Roma: Fabrizio Serra, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;, ''Repetición y cine vacío''.&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Repetición y cine vacío'', La Cueva de Chauvet, La Plata: Malisia, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Cine, filosofía y filosofía analítica''.&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Cine, filosofía y filosofía analítica'', in: F. Santamaria Velasco et alia, ''Cine y Pensamiento'', Estéticas contemporáneas 9, Bogotá-Medellin: Universidad Claretiana, Universidad Santo Tomás, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Philosophy of language and logic ==

For Cabrera, philosophies of language are philosophies for which language does not matter in so far as it merely conveys something, but insofar as it constitutes – and implements – concepts and structures of understanding of the world. From this large sense of the term, he identifies four philosophies of language, which are: [[analytic philosophy|analytical]], [[hermeneutic]], phenomenological and meta-critical. Looking through the prism of negativity, Cabrera shows how the four above types of philosophies of language fail at a common point: their incapacity to fight against the failures of meaning. For the analytics, the point presents itself in the “meaninglessness” of expressions which is treated as a limit beyond which one should not go. However, according to Cabrera, this analytic objectivism excludes fundamental dimensions of the problem of meaning, such as time and lived experience. Phenomenology expands the analytic semantic horizon with the dimension of [[intentionality]] (of which analytic [[intensionality]] is only an inauthentic correlate, essentially objective) without the problem of meaninglessness being tamed. It remains for phenomenology, however, the temporality and historicity that hermeneutics adds to the approach of the problem, which is called "misunderstanding". Hermeneutic falls into the basic "distortions of meanings", something stronger than "meaninglessness" and "misunderstanding", a subject of meta-critical philosophies, represented by [[Karl Marx|Karl Marx’s]] and [[Sigmund Freud|Sigmund Freud’s]] philosophies of language. 

Cabrera strongly criticizes the analytic approach to language for its denial of everything that is not objective. But according to him, also the other philosophies of language show their faults, from phenomenology to hermeneutics and even meta-criticism harboring therapies redeeming only in an illusory manner: [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic healing]] or [[communism|communist utopia]]. Cabrera’s philosophy of language is a philosophy of confrontations between philosophies, which can only be made under the sign of resignation in finitude and negativism. He argues that not one of the kinds of philosophies of language that have been side-by-side in the last century and a half can, by itself, account for the complexity of the human. It is in this sense that, for Cabrera, all understanding is, ultimately, a self-sustaining illusion.

Logic for Cabrera is often linked to three fundamental principles: (1) The object that propositions deal with is indeterminate and general, (2) Logic applies to ordinary reasoning, albeit with some effort, and (3) Logic is formal rather than lexical, that is, based on the structural and non-semantic connections in language. Cabrera constructs his thought in this area by criticizing each of these three basic premises of the logical tradition. 

His intuition in this field of research is the same as in others: the intersections of traditions enriches thought and is essential to account for the human condition. Thus, logical formalization is important for thinking about existence, just as the issues of human existence are essential for understanding thinking and logic. This conception of philosophy owes the hardly unorthodox intersections that Cabrera did in his studies of logic, connecting [[Saul Kripke]] with Martin Heidegger, [[Immanuel Kant]] with [[John Langshaw Austin|John Austin]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].

Cabrera's work has the expectation of allying the formal instruments to the [[existentialism|existential]] contents of life. The critique to the alleged empty generality of logic goes in this direction as well as the proposal of a lexical logic of predicative connections, in an attempt to lend to lexical analysis a formal dimension, but loaded with content. The specific work on concept networks in lexical logic was developed in partnership with the physicist Olavo Leopoldino da Silva Filho, from the University of Brasilia.

His work on logic also proceeds to a revision of the history of logic. An outline of his version of the history of logic would be as follows: (1) [[Aristotle]], in [[syllogism|syllogisms]] and beyond, (2) The [[Plato]]nic conception of logic, (3) The logic of the connections of meanings in the [[Middle Ages]], (4) Modern criticisms of [[formal logic]]: [[Francis Bacon]], [[Rene Descartes]] and [[John Locke]], the [[scientific method]] and logic, [[analysis|philosophical analysis]] and [[heuristics]], the [[Port-Royal Logic]], (5) The case of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]: what the official history took and what it didn't analyze, (6) Formal logic, [[transcendental logic]]: [[Immanuel Kant]], (7) The logic in motion of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]: Hegelian criticism of denial, (8) [[Mill's Methods|the logic of the induction]] of [[John Stuart Mill]], (9) Three conceptions of logic in the passage from the nineteenth to the twentieth century: [[Gottlob Frege]], [[John Dewey]] and [[Edmund Husserl]], logic within analysis, [[pragmatism]], and phenomenology, (10) The case of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]: what the official story took and what it didn't analyze.&lt;ref name=autoname2&gt;[http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/15264/1/LIVRO_MargensFilosofiasLinguagem.pdf] J.

Cabrera also develops a negative approach to argumentation in the field of informal logic, a pessimistic parallel theory to his negative ethics. For him, an affirmative approach to argumentation is one in which philosophical problems are considered to have one solution or at least an adequate treatment amongst many others that are inadequate and wrong. In Cabrera's view, according to the affirmative approach, the multiplicity of answers given by philosophy is a mistake which must be "resolved" in some way. On the other hand, according to the negative approach, the multiplicity of answers given by philosophy is not a mistake, but its most natural development. The negative approach to argumentation is concerned with treating one's own position and perspective not as a unique truth, but as one of many within an extensive and complex [[holism|holistic]] web of approaches and perspectives, that speak and criticize mutually without discarding one another, although each of such positions may be fiercely maintained based on its perspective and assumptions, supported on defensible grounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosopherjuliocabrera.blogspot.com/2011/05/philosophy-of-logic.html] J. Cabrera, ''Philosophy of logic'', ''The negative approach to argumentation''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://online.unisc.br/seer/index.php/signo/article/view/7990] J. Cabrera, ''Introduçao a uma abordagem negativa da argumentaçao'', Signo, Santa Cruz do Sul, volume 42, number 73, Januar/April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Latin American philosophy ==

Cabrera argues that there are epistemic injustices associated with the practice of philosophy in [[colonialism|colonized]] contexts such as in Latin America. In a lecture in [[Unisinos|Unisinos University]], Cabrera began to enunciate the problem of colonization in philosophy in a succinct and direct way:

{{blockquote|The problem is: they come here and talk about their problems in their language, we go there and talk about their problems in their language''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://filosofojuliocabrera.blogspot.com/2011/08/filosofia-no-brasil.html] J. Cabrera, ''A questão da filosofia no Brasil no contexto da reflexão sobre civilização e barbárie no pensamento argentino'', lecture given at Unisinos University, 14 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A central idea he came to defend is that the current status of philosophy in many Latin American countries is a product of the way philosophy is taught, researched, and written by local institutions that are subordinate to the international scene. Professional philosophy in these countries have been developed around commenting European (and, to a lesser extent, North American) philosophers, and this emphasis has developed as a corollary of the idea that philosophy is done only with reference to European philosophers and no Latin American is encouraged to challenge this hegemony. Alongside this inhibition of Latin American philosophy is the idea that what is European is universal while what is Latin American is merely local or national. He makes a diagnosis in the form of "acervo T" ("T collection"), theses on the hegemony of [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] philosophy; this collection of theses is understood by Cabrera as being tacitly adopted by most of the Latin American philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/18028/1/ARTIGO_EuropeuNaoSignificaUniversal.pdf] J. Cabrera, ''Europeu não significa universal, brasileiro não significa nacional'', Brasileira de Humanidades, Nabuco, number 2, November 2014/January/February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In opposition to this colonial order, Cabrera proposes and recommends several practices concerning the teaching and practice of philosophy, among them: (1) A greater attention to Latin American sources so that the history of philosophy on the continent does not continue to be ignored by local philosophers and that the work of these philosophers be as much discussed as that of European sources, (2) A stimulus to philosophy that is not from Latin America nor about Latin America, but from Latin America where the local starting point is made explicit, (3) The practice of appropriation in which philosophers from other contexts are placed in discussions of interest to Latin America. This practice can be found in important philosophical works in Latin America such as that of [[Enrique Dussel]] with which Cabrera maintained published debates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dianoia.filosoficas.unam.mx/files/1913/6132/3542/DIA52_Cabrera.pdf] J. Cabrera, ''Dussel y el suicídio'', Dianoia, XLIX, 52, 2004, pp. 111–124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autoname1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Análisis y existencia: pensamiento en travesía'', Córdoba: Ediciones del Copista, 2010, Essay 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabrera has defended the crossing of boundaries between traditions and has on many occasions shown the potential for fertilization stemming from the juxtaposition, friction and debate between philosophies originating from analytical and [[continental philosophy|continental]] traditions.&lt;ref name="autoname2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Análisis y existencia: pensamiento en travesía'', Córdoba: Ediciones del Copista, 2010, Essays 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, he extended this metaphilosophical approach in the direction of making it an element of the struggle against what he began to clearly see as the colonized state of philosophy in Latin America.

In his book ''Diário de um filósofo no Brasil'', Cabrera documents the problems of self-reliant inventive philosophy in Brazil; the book describes the environment of suppression of philosophical intuition in its many mechanisms attending to what is specific in the Brazilian colonized context.&lt;ref name="autoname3" /&gt; The book portraits what it means to philosophize from somewhere and tries to present alternatives to the philosophical commentary that can flourish even in a hostile environment. 

For Cabrera, it is important to understand from where philosophy in Latin America is made: it is made from invaded, looted, dominated countries that have been placed in intellectual subservience. He claims that this makes the philosophy produced there different from all European philosophy – and it is important to stress that no philosophy is born universal. Cabrera notes that philosophy in Brazil, especially made in departments in the academy, is particularly blind to the sources of Latin American thought, both from the classics ([[Bartolomé de Las Casas]], [[Antônio Vieira]], [[Flora Tristan]], [[Juan Bautista Alberdi]], [[José Martí]] and [[José Enrique Rodó]]) and contemporary ([[José Carlos Mariátegui]], [[Edmundo O'Gorman]], [[Leopoldo Zea]], [[Miguel León Portilla]], [[Roberto Fernández Retamar]] and Santiago Castro-Gómez), known only in isolated expert communities. His proposition is a course in the history of thought that begins with pre-Columbian [[Amerindian]] thought and which does not pass through Europeans (nor Greeks) until the nineteenth century. The idea is to read nineteenth-century European philosophers who challenged intellectualist and Christian traditions, such as Arthur Schopenhauer, [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and Friedrich Nietzsche (and their precursors [[Michel de Montaigne]], [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]), as influenced virtually by Amerindian ways of living and thinking.&lt;ref&gt;J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1106">'''League of peace''' ([[Latin]]: '''''foedus pacificum''''') is an expression coined by [[Immanuel Kant]] in his work "[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch]]". The league of peace should be distinguished from a [[peace treaty]] (''pactum pacis'') because a peace treaty prevents or terminates only one war, while the league of peace seeks to end all wars forever. This league does not hold any power of the state, but only exists for "the maintenance and security of the freedom of the state and of other states in league with it, without there being any need for them to submit to civil laws and their compulsion, as men in a state of nature must submit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/kant/kant1.htm|title=Immanuel Kant Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch 1795|accessdate=2007-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5978">'''Perspectivism''' ({{lang-de|Perspektivismus}}) is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] view (touched upon as far back as [[Plato]]'s rendition of [[Protagoras]]) that all ideations take place from particular [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspective]]s, and that there are many possible [[conceptual scheme]]s, or perspectives in which judgment of [[truth]] or value can be made. This is often taken to imply that no way of seeing the world can be taken as definitively "true", but does ''not'' necessarily [[logical consequence|entail]] that all perspectives are equally valid. The term was coined by nineteenth-century philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].

==View==
Perspectivism rejects [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] metaphysics, claiming that no evaluation of objectivity can transcend cultural formations or subjective designations. Therefore, there are no objective facts, nor any knowledge of [[Noumenon|a thing-in-itself]]. Truth is separated from any particular vantage point, and so there are no [[ethics|ethical]] or [[epistemology|epistemological]] [[wikt:absolute|absolutes]].&lt;ref&gt;Mautner, Thomas, ''The Penguin Dictionary of Philosophy'', 2005, page 418&lt;/ref&gt; Rules (i.e., those of philosophy, the scientific method, etc.) are constantly reassessed according to the circumstances of individual perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;Schacht, Richard, ''Nietzsche'', 1993, page 61.&lt;/ref&gt; "Truth" is thus created by integrating different vantage points together.

People always adopt perspectives by default &amp;ndash; whether they are aware of it or not &amp;ndash; and the concepts of one's existence are defined by the circumstances surrounding that individual. Truth is made by and for individuals and peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Scott-Kakures, Dion, ''History of Philosophy'', 1993, page 346&lt;/ref&gt; This view differs from many types of [[relativism]] which consider the truth of a particular [[proposition]] as something that altogether cannot be [[Validity (logic)|evaluated]] with respect to an "absolute truth", without taking into consideration [[culture]] and context.&lt;ref name="Appearance and the thing-in-itself"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nietzsche|first1=Friedrich|title=Human, All Too Human|date=1878|chapter=Section 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This view is outlined in an aphorism from Nietzsche's posthumously-assembled collection ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]''&lt;!--quotations from Nietzsche's Nachlass/The Will to Power must be cited to confirm this in Description--&gt;:

{{Quotation|In so far as the word "knowledge" has any meaning, the world is knowable; but it is ''interpretable'' [emphasis in original] otherwise, it has no meaning behind it, but countless meanings.—"Perspectivism."

''It is our needs that interpret the world; our drives and their For and Against.'' [emphasis added] Every drive is a kind of lust to rule; each one has its perspective that it would like to compel all the other drives to accept as a norm.|Friedrich Nietzsche; trans. [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]]|''The Will to Power'', §481 (1883–1888)&lt;ref&gt;Original German: ''Soweit überhaupt das Wort »Erkenntniß« Sinn hat, ist die Welt erkennbar: aber sie ist anders ''deutbar'', sie hat keinen Sinn hinter sich, sondern unzählige Sinne. – »Perspektivismus«. ¶ Unsere Bedürfnisse sind es, die die Welt auslegen; unsere Triebe und deren Für und Wider. Jeder Trieb ist eine Art Herrschsucht, jeder hat seine Perspektive, welche er als Norm allen übrigen Trieben aufzwingen möchte.'' (''Wille zur Macht'', [http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/6029/24 Nr. 481].)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Interpretation===
[[Richard Schacht]], in his interpretation of Nietzsche's thought, argues that this can be expanded into a revised form of "[[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]]" in relation to "[[subjectivity]]" as an aggregate of singular viewpoints that illuminate, for example, a particular idea in seemingly self-contradictory ways but upon closer inspection would reveal a difference of contextuality and of rule by which such an idea (e.g., that is fundamentally perspectival) can be validated. Therefore, it can be said each perspective is subsumed into and, taking account of its individuated context, adds to the overall objective measure of a proposition under examination. Nevertheless, perspectivism does not implicate any method of inquiry nor a [[structuralism|structural]] theory of knowledge in general.&lt;ref&gt;Schacht, Richard, ''Nietzsche'', 1993.{{page needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary philosophy==
In [[contemporary philosophy]], perspectivism was revived by [[José Ortega y Gasset]].&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;Holmes, Oliver, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/gasset/ "José Ortega y Gasset"], [[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] (Summer 2011 Edition), [[Edward N. Zalta]] (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''philosophy of human rights''' attempts to examine the underlying basis of the concept of [[human rights]] and critically looks at its content and justification. Several theoretical approaches have been advanced to explain how and why the concept of human rights developed.

One of the oldest Western philosophies on human rights is that they are a product of a natural law, stemming from different philosophical or religious grounds. Other theories hold that human rights codify moral behavior which is a human social product developed by a process of biological and social evolution (associated with [[David Hume|Hume]]). Human rights are also described as a sociological pattern of rule setting (as in the sociological theory of law and the work of [[Max Weber|Weber]]). These approaches include the notion that individuals in a society accept rules from legitimate authority in exchange for security and economic advantage (as in [[John Rawls|Rawls]]) – a social contract. The two theories that dominate contemporary human rights discussion are the interest theory and the will theory. Interest theory argues that the principal function of human rights is to protect and promote certain essential human interests, while will theory attempts to establish the validity of human rights based on the unique human capacity for freedom.&lt;ref name="IEOP"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fagan|first=Andrew|title=Human Rights|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hum-rts/#SH4b|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural rights==

{{Main article|Natural law|Natural right}}

Natural law theories base human rights on a "natural" moral, religious or even biological order that is independent of transitory human laws or traditions.

[[Socrates]] and his philosophic heirs, [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], posited the existence of [[natural justice]] or natural right (δίκαιον φυσικόν ''dikaion physikon''; [[Latin]] ''ius naturale''). Of these, Aristotle is often said to be the father of natural law,&lt;ref&gt;Shellens (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; although evidence for this is due largely to the interpretations of his work by [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaffa (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of this tradition of natural justice into one of natural law is usually attributed to the [[Stoicism|Stoics]].&lt;ref&gt;Sills (1968, 1972) ''Natural Law''&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the early [[Church Fathers]] sought to incorporate the until then [[paganism|pagan]] concept of natural law into [[Christianity]]. Natural law theories have featured greatly in the [[philosophy|philosophies]] of [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Francisco Suárez]], [[Richard Hooker]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Hugo Grotius]], [[Samuel von Pufendorf]], and [[John Locke]].

In the 16th century, asked by the Spanish monarchs to investigate the legitimacy of claims to land dominion by the ''indios'' of Latin America, Francisco de Vitoria expounded a theory of natural rights, especially in his famous ''Relectio de Indis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Thomas D.|title=The Pre-Hobbesian Roots of Natural Rights Theory|url=http://www.uprait.org/archivio_pdf/ao7103-williams.pdf|publisher=Alpha Omega|accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century [[Thomas Hobbes]] founded a [[social contract|contractualist theory]] of [[legal positivism]] beginning from the principle that man in the state of nature, which is to say without a "commonwealth" (a state) is in a state of constant war one with the other and thus in fear of his life and possessions (there being no property nor right without a sovereign to define it). Hobbes asserted natural law as how a rational human, seeking to survive and prosper, would act; the first principle of natural law being to seek peace, in which is self-preservation. Natural law (which Hobbes accepted was a misnomer, there being no law without a commonwealth) was discovered by considering humankind's natural interests, whereas previous philosophers had said that natural rights were discovered by considering the natural law. In Hobbes' opinion, the only way natural law could prevail was for human beings to agree to create a commonwealth by submitting to the command of a sovereign, whether an individual or an assembly of individuals. In this lay the foundations of the theory of a social contract between the governed and the governor.

[[Hugo Grotius]] based his philosophy of international law on natural law. He wrote that "even the will of an [[omnipotence|omnipotent]] being cannot change or abrogate" natural law, which "would maintain its objective validity even if we should assume the impossible, that there is no [[God]] or that he does not care for human affairs." (''De iure belli ac pacis'', Prolegomeni XI). This is the famous argument ''etiamsi daremus'' (''non esse Deum''), that made natural law no longer dependent on theology.

[[John Locke]] incorporated natural law into many of his theories and philosophy, especially in ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''. Locke turned Hobbes' prescription around, saying that if the ruler went against natural law and failed to protect "life, liberty, and property," people could justifiably overthrow the existing state and create a new one.

The Belgian philosopher of law [[Frank Van Dun]] is one among those who are elaborating a secular conception&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.ugent.be/~frvandun/Texts/Logica/NaturalLaw.htm|author=van Dun, Frank|accessdate=28 December 2007 |title=Natural Law}}&lt;/ref&gt; of natural law in the liberal tradition. There are also emerging and secular forms of natural law theory that define human rights as derivative of the notion of universal human dignity.&lt;ref&gt;Kohen (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

"Dignity" is a key term for the discussion of human rights. The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] does not justify its claims on any philosophical basis, but rather it simply appeals to human dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theology and the Boundary Discourse of Human Rights|last = Regan|first = Ethna|publisher = Georgetown University Press|year = 2010|isbn = 978-1-58901-642-2|location = Washington D.C.|pages = 18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Rahner]] discusses human dignity as it relates to freedom. Specifically, his ideas of freedom relate to human rights as an appeal to the freedom to [[Karl Rahner#Incarnation-grace|communicate with the divine]]. As embodied individuals who can have this freedom and dignity threatened by external forces, the protection of this dignity takes on an appeal to protect human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theology and the Boundary Discourse of Human Rights|last = Regan|first = Ethna|publisher = Georgetown University Press|year = 2010|isbn = 978-1-58901-642-2|location = Washington, D.C.|pages = 85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "human rights" has replaced the term "natural rights" in popularity, because the rights are less and less frequently seen as requiring natural law for their existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Weston, Burns H.|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106289?query=human%20rights&amp;ct=eb|title=Human Rights|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online, p. 2|accessdate=18 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some, the debate on human rights remains thus a debate around the correct interpretation of Natural Law, and human rights themselves a positive, but reductionist, expression thereof&lt;ref&gt;Jakob Cornides, [http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&amp;context=jakob_cornides Natural and Un-Natural Law], New York, C-Fam (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social contract==

The English philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] suggested the existence of a hypothetical ''social contract'' where a group of free individuals agree for the sake of preservation to form institutions to govern them. They give up their natural complete liberty in exchange for protection from the Sovereign. This led to [[John Locke]]'s theory that a failure of the government to secure rights is a failure which justifies the removal of the government, and was mirrored in later postulation by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in his "Du Contrat Social" ([[The Social Contract]]).

International [[equity (law)|equity]] expert Paul Finn has echoed this view:

{{cquote|the most fundamental fiduciary relationship in our society is manifestly that which exists between the community (the people) and the state, its agencies and [[official]]s.|||Paul Finn&lt;ref name = "zogvfu"/&gt;}}

The relationship between government and the governed in countries which follow the [[English law]] tradition is a [[fiduciary]] one. In equity law, a politician's fiduciary obligations are not only the duties of good faith and loyalty, but also include duties of skill and [[competence (human resources)|competence]] in managing a country and its people. Originating from within the [[Court of equity|Courts of Equity]], the fiduciary concept exists to prevent those holding positions of power from abusing their authority. The fiduciary relationship between government and the governed arises from the governments ability to control people with the exercise of its power. In effect, if a government has the power to abolish any rights, it is equally burdened with the fiduciary duty to protect such an interest because it would benefit from the exercise of its own discretion to extinguish rights which it alone had the power to dispose of.&lt;ref name = "zogvfu"&gt;Salevao (2005) p.76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reciprocity==

The Golden Rule, or the ''[[ethic of reciprocity]]'' states that one must do unto others as one would be treated themselves; the principle being that reciprocal recognition and respect of rights ensures that one's own rights will be protected. This principle can be found in all the world's major religions in only slightly differing forms, and was enshrined in the "Declaration Toward a Global Ethic" by the [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] in 1993.

==Soviet concept of human rights==

{{Main article|Human rights in the Soviet Union}}

Soviet concept of human rights was different from conceptions prevalent in the West. According to Western legal theory, "it is the individual who is the beneficiary of human rights which are to be asserted ''against'' the government", whereas Soviet law declared that [[State (polity)|state]] is the source of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Lambelet, Doriane. "The Contradiction Between Soviet and American Human Rights Doctrine: Reconciliation Through Perestroika and Pragmatism." 7 ''Boston University International Law Journal''. 1989. p. 61-62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shiman&gt;{{cite book | last = Shiman | first = David | title = Economic and Social Justice: A Human Rights Perspective | publisher = Amnesty International | year= 1999 | url = http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/edumat/hreduseries/tb1b/Section1/tb1-2.htm | isbn = 0-9675334-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Soviet legal system regarded [[law]] as an arm of politics and courts as agencies of the government.&lt;ref name="Pipes"/&gt; Extensive [[Extrajudicial punishment|extra-judiciary powers]] were given to the [[Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies|Soviet secret police agencies]]. The regime abolished Western [[rule of law]], [[civil liberties]], [[Criminal justice|protection of law]] and [[Property rights|guarantees of property]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Pipes]] (2001) ''Communism'' Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. {{ISBN|0-297-64688-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Pipes]] (1994) ''Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime''. Vintage. {{ISBN|0-679-76184-5}}., pages 401–403.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Vladimir Lenin]], the purpose of [[People's court (Soviet Union)|socialist courts]] was "not to eliminate [[Red Terror|terror]] ... but to substantiate it and legitimize in principle".&lt;ref name="Pipes"/&gt;

Crime was determined not as the infraction of law, but as any action which could threaten the Soviet state and society. For example, [[Speculation|a desire to make a profit]] could be interpreted as a [[Counter-revolutionary|counter-revolutionary activity]] punishable by death.&lt;ref name="Pipes"/&gt; [[Dekulakization|The liquidation and deportation of millions peasants in 1928–31]] was carried out within the terms of Soviet Civil Code.&lt;ref name="Pipes"&gt;[[Richard Pipes]] ''Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime'', Vintage books, Random House Inc., New York, 1995, {{ISBN|0-394-50242-6}}, pages 402–403&lt;/ref&gt; Some Soviet legal scholars even asserted that "criminal repression" may be applied in the absence of guilt.".&lt;ref name="Pipes"/&gt; [[Martin Latsis]], chief of the Ukrainian [[Cheka]] explained: "Do not look in the file of incriminating evidence to see whether or not the accused rose up against the Soviets with arms or words. Ask him instead to which [[social class|class]] he belongs, what is his background, his [[education]], his [[profession]]. These are the questions that will determine the fate of the accused. That is the meaning and essence of the [[Red Terror]]."&lt;ref name="State"&gt;[[Yevgenia Albats]] and Catherine A. Fitzpatrick. ''The State Within a State: The KGB and Its Hold on Russia – Past, Present, and Future'', 1994. {{ISBN|0-374-52738-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of [[Show trial|public trials]] was "not to demonstrate the existence or absence of a crime – that was predetermined by the appropriate [[CPSU|party authorities]] – but to provide yet another forum for [[Soviet propaganda|political agitation and propaganda]] for the instruction of the citizenry (see [[Moscow Trials]] for example). Defense lawyers, who had to be [[CPSU|party members]], were required to take their client's guilt for granted..."&lt;ref name="Pipes"/&gt;

==Other theories of human rights==

The philosopher [[John Finnis]] argues that human rights are justifiable on the grounds of their instrumental value in creating the necessary conditions for human well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/h/hum-rts.htm#SH4b|title=''Human Rights''|publisher=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author=Fagan, Andrew|year=2006|accessdate=1 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finnis (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; Interest theories highlight the duty to respect the rights of other individuals on grounds of self-interest:

{{cquote|Human rights law, applied to a State's own citizens serves the interest of states, by, for example, minimizing the risk of violent resistance and protest and by keeping the level of dissatisfaction with the government manageable|||Niraj Nathwani in ''Rethinking refugee law''&lt;ref&gt;Nathwani (2003) p.25&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Biology|biological]] theory considers the comparative reproductive advantage of human social behavior based on empathy and [[altruism]] in the context of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnhart (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clayton, Schloss (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Miller, Paul (2001): Arnhart, Larry. ''Thomistic Natural Law as Darwinian Natural Right'' p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Human security}}
[[Human security]] is an emerging school of thought which challenges the traditional, state-based conception of security and argues that a people-focused approach to security is more appropriate in the modern interdependent world and would be more effective in advancing the security of individuals and societies across the globe.

;Ipso facto legal rights theory

According to the recommendation of human rights scholar Barrister Dr Mohammed Yeasin Khan LLB Honours, LLM, PhD, PGDL, Barrister-at-Law (Lincoln’s Inn), UK: ‘Right’ being synonymous of ‘legal’ and antonymous of both ‘wrong’ and ‘illegal’, every ‘right’ of any human person is ipso facto a ‘legal right’ which deserves protection of law and legal remedy irrespective of having been written into the law, constitution or otherwise in any country.&lt;ref&gt;Protection and Promotion of Human Rights for Peace and Development: Barrister Dr Mohammed Yeasin Khan LlB Honours, LLM, PhD, PGDL, Barrister-at-Law (Lincoln’s Inn), UK. [Page 63]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Man for man theory of world peace

According to Barrister Dr Mohammed Yeasin Khan: The only way ‘(a) to make the world terrorism and war free and also free from hunger, poverty, discrimination and exploitation; (b) to establish rule of law and economic, political and social justice; and (c) to confirm freedom of man, peace and development worldwide’ is protection and promotion human rights as ‘Ipso Facto Legal Rights’ and the unity of the world community in one and single theory of ‘man for man’ correlative, interdependent and ‘one to one-cum-one for other’ approach, namely, the ‘Man for Man Theory’ approach of world peace.&lt;ref&gt;Protection and Promotion of Human Rights for Peace and Development: Barrister Dr Mohammed Yeasin Khan, LLB Honours (London), LLM (Northumbria), PhD (CIU), PGDL (Northumbria), Barrister-at-Law (Lincoln’s Inn), UK [Page 70-71]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques of human rights==

The idea of [[human rights]] is not without its critics. [[Jeremy Bentham]], [[Edmund Burke]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Karl Marx]] are examples of historical philosophers who criticised the notion of [[natural rights]]. [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] is a leading contemporary critic of human rights. His criticisms are discussed below.

===Edmund Burke on natural rights===

[[Edmund Burke]] was an 18th-century philosopher, political theorist and statesman largely associated with the school of [[conservatism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hampsher-Monk|first=Iain|title=The political philosophy of Edmund Burke|year=1987|publisher=Longman|location=New Work|pages=preface, x}}&lt;/ref&gt; His views on [[natural rights]] are best articulated in ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'', which directly attacked the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen]]'' (1789) and its authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A great deal of Burke’s uneasiness of the ''Declaration'' lies in the drafter’s abandonment of the existing establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Burke, constitutional legitimacy was derived not from the Rousseauian doctrine of [[general will]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; but from a form of inherited wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Canavan|first=Francis P.|title=The Political Reason of Edmund Burke|year=1960|publisher=Duke University Press|location=London|pages=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that it was arrogant and limiting for the drafters of the ''Declaration'' to cast aside traditional notions that had stood the test of time.&lt;ref name="Burke"&gt;{{cite web|last=Burke|first=Edmund|title=Reflections on the Revolution in France 1790|url=http://www.constitution.org/eb/rev_fran.htm#01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“they have no respect for the wisdom of others; but they pay it off by a very full measure of confidence in their own”&lt;/ref&gt; Although it may seem to the drafters that they had abandoned the shackles of tradition, for Burke, they had limited their findings to the narrow minded conception of one person or group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mosher|first=Michael A.|title=The Skeptic's Burke: Reflections on the Revolution in Frabce, 1790-1990|journal=Political Theory|date=August 1991|volume=19|issue=3|pages=391–418 at 404|doi=10.1177/0090591791019003006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the grounding from which Burke’s attack of the ''Declaration'' is based.

Burke did not deny the existence of natural rights; rather he thought that the [[a priori (epistemology)|a priori]] reasoning adopted by the drafters produced notions that were too abstract to have application within the framework of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Canavan|first=Francis P.|title=The Political Reason of Edmund Burke|year=1960|publisher=Duke University Press|location=London|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; In stating that “the pretended right of these theorists are all extremes; and in a proportion as they are metaphysically true, they are morally and politically false”,&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt; Burke identified that abstract rights are meaningless without a societal framework:

{{cquote|What is the use of discussing a man’s abstract right to food or medicine? The question is upon the method of procuring and administering them.|||Edmund Burke&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt;}}

In contrast to [[John Locke|Locke]], Burke did not believe the purpose of government was to protect pre-existing natural rights;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Michael|title=Edmund Burke and the Critique of Political Radicalism|year=1980|publisher=Basil Blackwell Publisher|location=Oxford|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; he believed “the primitive rights of man undergo such a variety of refractions and reflections, that it becomes absurd to talk of them as if they continued in the simplicity of their original direction.”&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt; For Burke it was the government, as a result of long social evolution, that transformed the meaningless natural rights into the practical advantaged afforded to citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Canavan|first=Francis P.|title=The Political Reason of Edmund Burke|year=1960|publisher=Duke University Press|location=London|pages=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not the rights themselves, as much as the level of abstraction and the placing of them above government which Burke found dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Michael|title=Edmund Burke and the Critique of Political Radicalism|year=1980|publisher=Basil Blackwell Publisher|location=Oxford|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated “those who pull down important ancient establishments, who wantonly destroy modes of administration, and public institutions… are the most mischievous, and therefore the wickedest of men”.&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt; For Burke politics had no simple answers, and definitely no overarching, universal maxims such as those expressed in the ''Declaration''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather the rights afforded to individuals were to be assessed in the context of the social framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Canavan|first=Francis P.|title=The Political Reason of Edmund Burke|year=1960|publisher=Duke University Press|location=London|pages=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he acknowledged that the simplicity of the ''Declaration'' was attractive and feared its ability to undermine social order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Michael|title=Edmund Burke and the Critique of Political Radicalism|year=1980|publisher=Basil Blackwell Publisher|location=Oxford|pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke believed that the absolute nature of these principles of abstraction were inherently revolutionary; they were uncompromising and any derogation from the principles a reason to rise up in arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Michael|title=Edmund Burke and the Critique of Political Radicalism|year=1980|publisher=Basil Blackwell Publisher|location=Oxford|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a problem because;

{{cquote|All government… is founded on compromise and barter. We balance inconveniences; we give and take; we remit some rights, that we may enjoy others; and we choose rather to be happy citizens, than subtle disputants.|||Edmund Burke&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt;}}

The natural rights “Against which there can be no prescription; against these no agreements is binding”&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt; gave the revolutionaries the tools to destroy the very society that Burke believed afforded them with rights. In this way Burke thought the rights contained in the ''Declaration'' would lead to “the antagonist world of madness, discord, vice, confusion, and unavailing sorrow.”&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt;

===Jeremy Bentham on natural rights===

The 18th-century [[Utilitarian]] philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] criticised the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen]]'' in his text ''Anarchical Fallacies''. He famously asserted that the concept of natural rights was “nonsense upon stilts”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bentham|first=Jeremy|title=Anarchical Fallacies|url=http://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/lpw/documents/Bentham_Anarchical_Fallacies.pdf|page=line. 229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bentham criticised the ''Declaration'' both for the language that it adopted and the theories it posited, stating; “Look to the letter, you find nonsense; look beyond the letter, you find nothing.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bentham|first=Jeremy|title=Anarchical Fallacies|url=http://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/lpw/documents/Bentham_Anarchical_Fallacies.pdf|page=line.104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the critiques Bentham levelled against the ''Declaration'' was its assertions of rights in the form of absolute and universal norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; He identified that absolute rights possessed by everyone equally are meaningless and undesirable. They lack meaning because if everyone has, for example, unbounded liberty, there is nothing precluding them from using that liberty to impinge on the liberty of another. In this way “human government and human laws”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parakh|first=Bhikhu|title=Bentham's Political Thought|year=1973|publisher=Croom Helm|location=London|pages=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; are required to give some bounds to rights in order for them to be realised.&lt;ref name="Waldron 1987 39"&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if advocates of absolute rights recognise this necessity, as the proponents of the ''Declaration'' did, Bentham argues that it is in vain.&lt;ref name="Waldron 1987 39"/&gt; “It would be self-contradictory, because these rights are, in the same breath which their existence is declared, declared to be impresciptable; and impriscriptable… means nothing unless it excludes the interference of the laws.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bentham|first=Jeremy|title=Anarchical Fallacies|url=http://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/lpw/documents/Bentham_Anarchical_Fallacies.pdf|page=line. 317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to this contradiction, Bentham warned of the dangers of couching rights in absolute terms. A government that is able to protect every person’s right absolutely and equally is a utopian aspiration, but the ''Declaration'' couches it as the conditions for its legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Against every government which fails in any degree of fulfilling these expectations, then, it is the professed object of this manifesto to excite insurrection.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parakh|first=Bhikhu|title=Bentham's Political Thought|year=1973|publisher=Croom Helm|location=London|pages=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bentham does not deny that there are some laws that are morally wrong; his uneasiness is in easily justifying a revolutionary call to arms – with the violence, chaos and destruction associated with it – based on a repugnant law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the theoretical faults, Bentham thought that natural rights were a construction adopted to pursue the selfish aims of the drafters, of which no logical basis could be found.&lt;ref name="Philip Schofield 1832"&gt;Philip Schofield, "Bentham, Jeremy (1748–1832)"; Ed. Donald M. Borchert, ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Vol. 1. 2nd ed. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2006) at 555&lt;/ref&gt; He acknowledged that it may be desirable to have rights, but “a reason for wishing that a certain right were established, is not that right; want is not supply; hunger is not bread.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bentham|first=Jeremy|title=Anarchical Fallacies|url=http://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/lpw/documents/Bentham_Anarchical_Fallacies.pdf|page=line 226}}&lt;/ref&gt; To establish rights existed by virtue of laws enacted by a sovereign was logically sound, but to assert rights established by nature was not.&lt;ref name="Philip Schofield 1832"/&gt; “A natural right is a son that never had a father.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only did Bentham think that there was no logical basis for the theory of natural rights, but he believed that their individualistic approach was harmful to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|The great enemies of public peace are the selfish and the dissocial passions – necessary as they are – the one to the very existence of each individual, the other to his security…What has been the object, the perpetual and palpable object, of this declaration to pretended rights? To add such force as possible to these passions, but already too strong, - to burst the cords that hold them in, - to say to the selfish passions, there – everywhere – is your prey! - to the angry passions, there –everywhere- is your enemy. Such is the morality of this celebrated manifesto.|||Jeremy Bentham&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bentham|first=Jeremy|title=Anarchical Fallacies|url=http://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/lpw/documents/Bentham_Anarchical_Fallacies.pdf|page=line 64}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bentham thought that society was dependent upon people's ability to pursue the greater good, not just the short-term satisfaction of their own desires. The advancement of natural rights, which he saw as celebrating selfishness, was to provide the means to break down the social community that makes human life bearable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marxist Critique of human rights===
In [[On the Jewish Question]], [[Karl Marx]] criticized ''Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen'' as bourgeois ideology:
:''Above all, we note the fact that the so-called rights of man, the droits de l'homme as distinct from the droits du citoyen, are nothing but the rights of a member of civil society – i.e., the rights of egoistic man, of man separated from other men and from the community. ... according to the Declaration of the Rights of Man of 1791:
:''"Liberty consists in being able to do everything which does not harm others."''
:''Liberty, therefore, is the right to do everything that harms no one else. The limits within which anyone can act without harming someone else are defined by law, just as the boundary between two fields is determined by a boundary post.''
and that:
:''Security is the supreme social concept of bourgeois society, the concept of the police, the whole society exists only to ensure each of its members the preservation of his person, his rights and his property.''

Thus for Marx, liberal rights and ideas of justice are premised on the idea that each of us needs protection from other human beings. Therefore, liberal rights are rights of separation, designed to protect us from such perceived threats. Freedom on such a view, is freedom from interference. What this view denies is the possibility — according to Marx, the fact — that real freedom is to be found positively in our relations with other people. It is to be found in human community, not in isolation. So insisting on a regime of rights encourages us to view each other in ways which undermine the possibility of the real freedom we may find in human emancipation.

Marxist critical theorist [[Slavoj Žižek]] argued that: "liberal attitudes towards the other are characterized both by respect for otherness, openness to it, and an obsessive fear of harassment. In short, the other is welcomed insofar as its presence is not intrusive, insofar as it is not really the other. Tolerance thus coincides with its opposite. My duty to be tolerant towards the other effectively means that I should not get too close to him or her, not intrude into his space—in short, that I should respect his intolerance towards my over-proximity. This is increasingly emerging as the central human right of advanced capitalist society: the right not to be 'harassed', that is, to be kept at a safe distance from others." and "universal human rights are effectively the right of white, male property-owners to exchange freely on the market, exploit workers and women, and exert political domination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/against-human-rights-zizek |title=Against human rights - Slavoj Žižek |publisher=libcom.org|date=2010-02-19 |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British sociologist [[Robert Fine]] claims that the key to Marx’s argument was to rebut the radicalism Bauer espoused: a radicalism that not only denied the rights of Jews but at once trashed the rights of man and citizen as such. What Marx stood for in the Jewish Question as in his earlier writings more generally was a philosophy of right. Fine believes what Marx stood against was a spiritless radicalism that revealed its inhumanity not only through its hostility to Jews but also through its hostility to the idea of right." Moreover, Fine argued that Marx argued that the society that gives rise to the idea of rights is the same as that which gives rise to the commodity form. They are two sides of the same medal. It is a society based on production by independent producers whose contact with each other is mediated through the exchange of products on the market. These producers are formally free to produce what and how much they wish. They are formally equal in that no producer can force others to produce against their will or expropriate their products against their will. They are self-interested in that they are all entitled to pursue their own private interests regardless of what others think or do. Their contact with other producers takes the form of free and equal exchanges in which individuals exchange their property in return for the property of another and this exchange of unneeded things in return for useful things appears to be done for the mutual benefit of each party.

Fine also claims that for Marx, exchange relations appear to be formed among free and equal property owners who enter a voluntary contract in pursuit of their own self-interest. Fine cites what he believes to be Marx's point about how in exchange lies the clue to all modern conceptions of freedom and equal right:

:Although individual A feels a need for the commodity of individual B, he does not appropriate it by force, nor vice versa, but rather recognise one another reciprocally as proprietors, as persons whose will penetrates their commodities. Accordingly, the juridical moment of the Person enters here… all inherent contradictions of bourgeois society appear extinguished ... and bourgeois democracy even more than the bourgeois economists takes refuge in this aspect.: (Marx, Grundrisse:243, 251)

Furthermore, the parties to the exchange must place themselves in relation to one another as persons whose will resides in those objects and must behave in such a way that each does not appropriate the commodity of the other and alienate his own, except through an act to which both parties consent. Marx characterised this sphere of commodity exchange as ‘a very Eden of the innate rights of man’ – the realm of Freedom, Equality, Property and
Bentham:

:‘Freedom because both buyer and seller of a commodity ... are determined only by their own free will....Equality because each enters into relations with the other as with a simple owner of commodities and they exchange equivalent with equivalent. Property because each disposes only what is his own. And Bentham because each looks only to his own advantage. The only force bringing them together is the selfishness, the gain and the private interest of each.: (Marx, Capital 1: 280)

Thus according to [[Robert Fine]], Marx's basic criticism was that within political society people were seen as co-operative, while in their economic roles they were competitive, individualistic and egoistic. In short, the theory of rights expressed the division and alienation of human beings.

===Alasdair MacIntyre on human rights===

[[Alasdair MacIntyre]] is a Scottish philosopher who has published a number of works in a variety of philosophical fields, including [[political philosophy]], [[ethics]] and [[metaphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clayton|first1=Ted|title=Political Philosophy of Alasdair MacIntyre|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/p-macint/|work=Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|accessdate=31 December 2005 |editor1=James Fieser|editor2=Bradley Dowden}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacIntyre criticises the concept of [[human rights]] in [[After Virtue]] and he famously asserts that “there are no such rights, and belief in them is one with belief in witches and in unicorns.”&lt;ref name="MacIntyre 1981 67"&gt;{{cite book|last=MacIntyre|first=Alasdair|title=After Virtue|year=1981|publisher=Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co.|location=London|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacIntyre argues that every attempt at justifying the existence of human rights has failed. The assertions by 18th century philosophers that [[natural rights]] are self-evident truths, he argues, are necessarily false as there are no such things as self-evident truths. He says that the plea 20th century philosophers made to intuition show a flaw in philosophical reasoning. MacIntyre then outlines that, although [[Ronald Dworkin|Dworkin]] is not wrong in asserting that the inability to demonstrate a statement does not necessitate its falsity, the same argument can be applied in relation to witches and unicorns.&lt;ref name="MacIntyre 1981 67"/&gt;

MacIntyre made this critique of human rights in the context of a wider argument about the failure of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] to produce a coherent moral system.&lt;ref name="Knight 1998 70"&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Kelvin|title=The MacIntyre Reader|year=1998|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers of the enlightenment sought to cast aside the discredited notions of hierarchy and [[theology]] as justifications for morality. Instead, MacIntyre argues, the enlightenment placed the individual as the sovereign authority to dictate what is right and wrong. However allegiances to historical notions of morality remained and philosophers sought to find a secular and rational justification for existing beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacIntyre|first=Alasdair|title=After Virtue|year=1981|publisher=Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co.|location=London|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem, MacIntyre maintains, is that theological morality was developed to overcome defects in human nature; to posit an example of the ideal. Without this notion of ‘perfect humanity’ the only remaining foundation to build a moral theory on was the foundation of imperfect human nature.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. A. Garcia, "Modern(ist) Moral Philosophy and MacIntyrean Critique" in ed. Mark C. Murphy ''Alasdair MacIntyre'' (2003, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press) at pp 135–136&lt;/ref&gt; For MacIntyre, the result was a collection of moral stances, each claiming to have a rational justification and each disputing the findings of the rival notions.&lt;ref name="Knight 1998 70"/&gt;

MacIntyre believes that a number of the moral debates that occur in society can be explained as a result of this failure of the “Enlightenment Project”.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. A. Garcia, "Modern(ist) Moral Philosophy and MacIntyrean Critique" in ed. Mark C. Murphy ''Alasdair MacIntyre'' (2003, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press) at pp 96&lt;/ref&gt; Human rights are an example of a moral belief, founded in previous theological beliefs, which make the false claim of being grounded in rationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Kelvin|title=The MacIntyre Reader|year=1998|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate how the principles lead to conflict, he gives the example of [[abortion]]; in this case the right of the mother to exercise control over her body is contrasted with the deprivation of a potential child to the right to life. Although both the right to liberty and the right to life are, on their own, considered morally acceptable claims, conflict arises when we posit them against each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacIntyre|first=Alasdair|title=After Virtue|year=1981|publisher=Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co.|location=London|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory of value and property==
{{See also|Property}}
[[Henry of Ghent]] articulated the theory that every person has a property interest in their own body.&lt;ref&gt;Tierney (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Locke]] uses the word property in both broad and narrow senses. In a broad sense, it covers a wide range of human interests and aspirations; more narrowly, it refers to material goods. He argues that property is a natural right and it is derived from labour.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Locke]]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, property precedes government and government cannot "dispose of the estates of the subjects arbitrarily." To deny valid property rights according to Locke is to deny human rights. The British philosopher had significant impacts upon the development of the Government of the UK and was central to the fundamental founding philosophy of the United States. [[Karl Marx]] later critiqued Locke's theory of property in his ''Theories of Surplus Value'', seeing the beginnings of a theory of [[surplus value]] in Locke's works. In Locke's ''Second Treatise'' he argued that the right to own private property was unlimited as long as nobody took more than they could use without allowing any of their property to go to waste and that there were enough common resources of comparable quality available for others to create their own property. Locke did believe that some would be more "industrious and rational" than others and would amass more property, but believed this would not cause shortages. Though this system could work before the introduction of [[money]], Marx argued in ''Theories of Surplus Value'' that Locke's system would break down and claimed money was a contradiction of the law of nature on which private property was founded.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughn (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dilthey1-4.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Wilhelm Dilthey]]]]

There are at least two senses in which the term [[philosophy]] is used: a formal and an informal sense. In the formal sense, philosophy is an academic study of the fields of [[aesthetics]], [[ethics]], [[epistemology]], [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], as well as [[Social philosophy|social]] and [[political philosophy]]. One's "'''philosophy of life'''" is philosophy in the informal sense, as a personal philosophy, whose focus is resolving the [[Meaning of life|existential questions]] about the [[human condition]].&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Fetler, ''Philosophy and Philosophy of Religion Charts'', Sun Press, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;  

"Philosophy of life" also refers to a specific conception of philosophizing as a [[way of life]],&lt;ref name="Hadot"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/hadot/ Pierre Hadot (1922-2010)] by Matthew Sharpe in the [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]].&lt;/ref&gt; endorsed by the German ''[[Lebensphilosophie]]'' movement whose main representative is [[Wilhelm Dilthey]]&lt;ref&gt;Scott Campbell, Paul W. Bruno (eds.), ''The Science, Politics, and Ontology of Life-Philosophy'', Bloomsbury, 2013, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and several other [[Continental philosophers]] such as [[Henri Bergson]]&lt;ref&gt;Michael Chase, Stephen R. L. Clark, Michael McGhee (eds.), ''Philosophy as a Way of Life: Ancients and Moderns – Essays in Honor of Pierre Hadot'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2013, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pierre Hadot]].&lt;ref name="Hadot"/&gt;

==The human situation==
{{prose|section|date=April 2013}}

{{Main|Human situation}}
The human situation appears to be a struggle between what ''is'' (existence) and what ''ought'' (essence) to be.
* [[Normative situation]]s&amp;nbsp;– [[Alternative lifestyle|Alternatives]], [[Choice]], [[Liberty|Freedom]], [[Value (personal and cultural)|Values]], [[Moral code|Standards]], [[Ideal (ethics)|Ideals]], [[Obligation]], [[Moral responsibility|Responsibility]]
* [[Existential predicament]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Finitude]], [[Social alienation|Alienation]], [[Anxiety]], [[Guilt (emotion)|Guilt]], [[Ambivalence]], [[Thrownness]]

==Main answers to the existential question==
There are at least three prevailing theories on how to respond to the existential question.

===Denial of essence===
* [[Nihilism]], denial of meaning

===Denial of existence===
* [[Essentialism]]

===Affirmation of life===
* [[Secular humanism]]
* [[Religion]]

==Religion as an attempt to overcome the existential predicament==
There are two basic forms of [[existentialism]]:

===Religious existentialism===
{{Main|Christian existentialism}}

Religious existentialism is best exemplified by [[St. Augustine]], [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Paul Tillich]], and the philosophy of [[Søren Kierkegaard]]. Religious existentialism holds that there are two levels of reality, essence, which is the ground of [[being]], and existence. Religion is the ultimate concern in this view.

===Atheistic existentialism===
{{Main|Atheistic existentialism}}

Atheistic existentialism is best exemplified by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Martin Heidegger]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. It holds that there is one level of reality, existence. In this view, each person constructs his own unique and temporary essence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7210">'''Philosophy of sport''' is an area of [[philosophy]] that seeks to conceptually analyze issues of sport as human activity. These issues cover many areas, but fall primarily into five philosophical categories: metaphysics, ethics and moral philosophy, philosophy of law, political philosophy, and aesthetics. The philosophical perspective on sport originated in Ancient Greece, having experienced a revival in the latter part of the 20th century&lt;ref name= "Reid"&gt;{{cite book

A philosophical perspective on sports incorporates its metaphysical relationships with art and play, ethical issues of virtue and fairness and more broadly sociopolitical.&lt;ref name="Reid" /&gt;

==Sport and philosophy in ancient Greece==

Ancient Greece is considered the birthplace of both [[ancient philosophy]] and [[Olympic sport]]. Hellenistic philosophies hung great significance on athletic performance. A leader's athletic prowess, according to the view of the times, reflected their ability to lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.cambridgescholars.com/download/sample/59965 |title=Philosophy of Sport|editor1 = Hardman, Alun |editor2=Jones, Carwyn |isbn=1-4438-2516-6|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Games of the [[Phaeacians]] in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'') Sport was seen as an [[epistemic]] inquiry, a methodological process by which we learn the objective truth of a person's athletic potential by actualizing it in athletic competition. Athletics as a measure of individual worth was seen as a cure to social inequality. Sport was even seen as moral education, with Plato advocating the participation of women in sport for their moral enrichment. Aristotle emphasized physical activity as an ethical responsibility. Mentions of sport were also found in the work of [[Plato]].&lt;ref name="Reid" /&gt;

==Contemporary philosophy of sport==

The resurgence of interest in philosophy of sport was marked by Yale philosopher [[Paul Weiss (philosopher)|Paul Weiss]]' book publication ''Sport: A Philosophical Inquiry (1969)'', considered the first book-length text in philosophy of sport. In it, Weiss explains the dearth of work in philosophy of sport as a reflection of academic elitism. Sport was always considered vulgar or common, according to Weiss.&lt;ref&gt;Shouler, Kenneth (2003) [http://philosophynow.org/issues/41/If_Life_is_Finite_Why_am_I_Watching_this_Damn_Game If Life is Finite, Why am I Watching this Damn Game?] ''Philosophy Now''&lt;/ref&gt;

Long before this, however, philosophical considerations of sport and physical and activity were discussed as a subset of educational reform in the late 19th century as the link between physical education and health and well-being gained appreciation among scholars. To many of the time, the health and educational benefits of physical activity were a component of public life. Inadvertently, many non-philosopher proponents of physical education took on philosophical positions on teleology, mind-body dualism and metaphysics as part of their model of human agency and personhood. In a broader context, political philosophy entered the picture as thinkers of the time, in response to pressing social and political issues of the day associated civic duty, responsible citizenship and other political features to sport.&lt;ref name="Kretchmar" /&gt; While much of the focus has been on the work done in the West, philosophers of sport acknowledge the importance of work done in the East, particularly Japan.&lt;ref name="heacademy.ac.uk"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090206052502/http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/assets/hlst/documents/resources/philosophy_ethics_sport.pdf Resource Guide to the Philosophy of Sport and Ethics of Sport]. Hospitality, Leisure, Sport and Tourism Network, October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Important questions in philosophy of sport are concerned with the social virtues of sport, the aesthetics of sporting performances and display, the epistemology of individual and team strategy and techniques, sporting ethics, the logic of rules in sport, metaphysics of sport as a component of human nature or instinct, etc.&lt;ref name="heacademy.ac.uk"/&gt; However, some writers have composed a philosophy of sport in terms of the body, art and its intersections with generation X sports, such as bouldering, surfing, skateboarding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sanzaro, Francis |title=The Boulder: A Philosophy for Bouldering|isbn=0954877993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other areas of intersection with contemporary areas of philosophy include [[philosophy of education]], [[philosophy of law]], [[philosophy of mind]], philosophy of rules, [[philosophy of science]], [[social philosophy]] and [[political philosophy]].

==Issues in philosophy of sport==

===Ethics===
Ethical issues in philosophy of sport predominantly center on athlete behavior in relation to rules of the game, other athletes, spectators, external factors such as socioeconomic issues among supporters and communities, and issues of doping.

Issues of [[doping in sport]] focus on the ethics of medical intervention on athletic performance: what is acceptable versus what is not, and how boundaries can be drawn. Particular attention is given to the question of what factors ought to be taken into consideration when banning certain medical interventions.

These and other issues are usually compared and contrasted through the lenses of three significant moral theories: [[consequentialism]], [[deontology]] and [[virtue ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;McNamee, Mike.

'''Plato's Problem''' is the term given by [[Noam Chomsky]] to "the problem of explaining how we can know so much" given our limited experience.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam: Knowledge of Language, 1986, p. xxv&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky believes that Plato asked (using modern terms) how we should account for the rich, intrinsic, common structure of human cognition, when it seems undetermined by extrinsic evidence presented to a person during human development.&lt;ref&gt;[https://chomsky.info/1991____/ Noam Chomsky interview: Journal of Advanced Composition, Vol. 11, No. 1, 1991]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[linguistics]] this is referred to as the "[[argument from poverty of the stimulus]]" (APS). Such arguments are common in the natural sciences, where a developing theory is always "[[Underdetermination|underdetermined]] by evidence".&lt;ref&gt;[https://chomsky.info/1998____/ Hornstein, Norbert -- Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, London, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky's approach to Plato's Problem involves treating cognition as a normal research topic in the natural sciences, so cognition can be studied to elucidate intertwined genetic, developmental, and biophysical factors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://chomsky.info/20040517/ Chomsky, Noam, 2004: Biolinguistics and the Human Capacity]&lt;/ref&gt; Plato's Problem is most clearly illustrated in the [[Meno]] dialogue, in which [[Socrates]] demonstrates that an uneducated boy nevertheless understands geometric principles.

==Introduction==
What is [[knowledge]]? What is [[experience]]? How do they interact? Is there a correlational, causal, or reciprocal relationship between knowledge and experience? These and other related questions have been at the forefront of investigation by problem solvers, scientists, psychologists, and philosophers for centuries. These questions, but particularly the problem of how experience and knowledge interrelate, have broad theoretical and practical implications for such academic disciplines as [[epistemology]], linguistics, and [[psychology]] (specifically the subdiscipline of [[thinking]] and [[problem solving]]). Gaining a more precise understanding of human knowledge, whether defined as innate, [[Experiential knowledge|experiential]], or both, is an important part of effective problem solving.

[[Plato]] was the first [[philosopher]] who systematically inquired into issues such as those noted above. He wrote many dialogues, such as [[Euthyphro]] and the [[Apology (Plato)|Apology]], but it is from the [[Meno]] that the modern instantiation of Plato's Problem is derived. In the Meno, Plato theorizes about the relationship between knowledge and experience and provides an explanation for how it is possible to know something that one has never been explicitly taught. Plato believed that we possess [[innate]] ideas that precede any knowledge that we gain through experience.

As formulated by Noam Chomsky,[http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/linguistics/langmind.htm#dresher] accounting for this gap between knowledge and experience is "Plato's Problem". The phrase has a specific linguistic context with regard to language acquisition but can also be used more generally.

==Plato (427 B.C. – 347 B.C.)==

===Early work===
Plato's early philosophical endeavors involved poetry discussing many ideas, such as the differences between knowledge and opinion, particulars and [[universals]], and God and man. These early dialogues do not utilize conventional notions of [[reason]]. Rather, they appeal to the emotions, the [[allegorical]], the [[spirituality|spiritual]], and the [[mythological]] interests of an ancient speculative mind.

Controversy surrounds the early [[dialogues]] in how they are to be interpreted. Some claim that Plato was truly trying to discover objective reality through these mystical speculations while others maintain that the dialogues are stories to be interpreted only as parables, allegories, and emotional appeals to religious experience. Regardless, Plato would come to formulate a more rigorous and comprehensive philosophy later in his life, one that reverberates in contemporary [[Western culture|Western]] thought to this day.

Some of Plato's famous works are [[Phaedo]], the [[Crito]], and, as noted earlier, the Meno. Within these works are found a comprehensive philosophy that addresses epistemology, [[metaphysics]], [[ethics]], [[aesthetics]], [[theology]], and [[logic]]. As noted, most of the writing is in the form of dialogues and [[argument]]s to pursue answers to difficult questions and concepts. Plato's teacher and mentor, Socrates, always plays a significant and formative role in these dialogues.

===Socrates (470 B.C. – 399 B.C.)===
[[File:Socrates Louvre.jpg|thumb|right|Socrates]]
Most of Plato's philosophical ideas were communicated through his beloved teacher [[Socrates]] as a presence in the dialogues. Though there are no extant writings of Socrates known, it is evident through Plato's works that Socrates had an incredible ability to explore the most intense analytical discussions. However, for some there is controversy regarding how much historical fact can be derived from Plato's Socrates (Russell). Some doubt Socrates ever existed. Others are skeptical as to the accuracy of some of Plato's dialogues but nonetheless maintain that we can learn a substantial amount of historical information about Socrates from the dialogues. Still others take practically everything Plato wrote about Socrates as veridical history. Regardless, it may be safe to say that Plato never meant to record Socrates verbatim and it may plausibly be concluded that his general ideas were communicated in the dialogues.

====Socratic method====
As delineated in various writings, the meticulousness, articulation, and sophistication with which Socrates spoke supplies an outstanding problem solving technique – the [[Socratic Method]]. The Socratic method may be described as follows: it usually involves others with whom Socrates directly engages (not merely pontificating to an audience), it involves a deep philosophical or ethical question to which an answer was sought, and it usually involves Socrates asking questions either to affirm his understanding of others or to seek their understanding.

If someone disagreed with him, Socrates would execute this process in order to bring about his interlocutor's reluctant admission of inconsistencies and contradictions. Either Socrates would ask his debators questions about their claims that would lead them to admit their fallacy or Socrates would answer questions by posing questions meant to lead the other to answer their own query.

[[File:Socrates teaching.jpg|thumb|right|The Socratic Method]]

===Meno===
One such dialogue of Plato's that utilized the Socratic Method was the Meno. The participants were Socrates, Meno, Anytus, and one of Meno's slave boys. The dialogue begins with Meno asking Socrates whether [[virtue]] can be taught. Socrates responds by stating that he does not know the definition of virtue. Meno replies by stating the characteristics of a virtuous man, to which Socrates responds that the characteristics of a virtuous man may be the by-products of virtuousness but they by no means define virtue. Meno is obliged to agree; to wit, he tries to modify his explanation of virtue. Socrates counters each attempt by pointing to inconsistencies and circular arguments.

Meno seems to commit two fallacies when trying to define virtue. He either defines it using some form of the word itself, or he defines it using other words that call for definitions and explanations themselves. Eventually, Meno is led to confess his shortcomings as he tries to define the enigmatic term (the [[Socratic method]] is the mechanism that brings about this confession). Socrates claims that a definition of virtue must consist of common terms and concepts that are clearly understood by those in the discussion.

A crucial point in the dialogue is when Socrates tells Meno that there is no such thing as teaching, only recollection of knowledge from past lives, or [[Anamnesis (philosophy)|anamnesis]]. Socrates claims that he can demonstrate this by showing that one of Meno's servants, a slave boy, knows [[geometric]] principles though he is uneducated. Socrates states that he will teach the boy nothing, only ask him questions to assist the process of recollection. Socrates proceeds to ask the slave boy a series of questions about the size and length of lines and squares, using visual diagrams to aid the boy in understanding the questions. The crucial point to this part of the dialogue is that, though the boy has no training, he knows the correct answers to the questions – he intrinsically knows the [[Pythagorean theorem|Pythagorean proposition]].

====Innate knowledge====

Shortly before the demonstration of [[Pythagoras' theorem]], the dialogue takes an epistemological turn when the interlocutors begin to discuss the fundamental nature of knowledge. The general question asked is how one can claim to know something when one does not even know what knowledge is. Via the Socratic method, it is shown that the answer to the question posed is [[innate]]ness – one possesses ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' knowledge.

This is derived from Socrates' belief that one's soul existed in past lives and knowledge is transferred from those lives to the current one. "These [ideas] were revealed in a former state of existence, and are recovered by reminiscence (anamnesis) or association from sensible things" [http://plato.thefreelibrary.com/Meno/1-1]. The claim is that one does not need to know what knowledge is before gaining knowledge, but rather one has a wealth of knowledge before ever gaining any experience.

==Contemporary parallels==
There are contemporary contexts that provide input for the various questions posed here: how to account for the gap between experience and knowledge, what are some of the sources of knowledge, or how much knowledge is possessed prior to experience or without conscious awareness. There are many areas in contemporary linguistics and psychological research that have relevance to these epistemological questions. Linguistic analysis has provided some strong evidence for innate cognitive capacities for language and there are many areas of cognitive psychology that yield hard data from investigations into sources of knowledge. In addition, there are some claims in the Meno that have connections to current research on perception and long-term memory (LTM).

===Linguistics===
[[File:Noam chomsky.jpg|thumb|right|Noam Chomsky]]
[[Linguistics]] is the scientific study of language. Chomskyan linguistics (''an inclusive, though perhaps informal, label for the theories and methodologies of linguistic study spearheaded by Noam Chomsky, meant to encompass his extensive work and influence in the field'') includes everything from Chomsky's earliest work in [[transformational grammar]] to more recent work in the [[Minimalist Program]]. More exactly, it is the study of the structure of language, or [[grammar]]. Chomskyan linguistics is defined by a particular theoretical foundation and methodological approach that sets it apart from other linguistic perspectives, such as those described by [[functional theories of grammar|functional grammar]] or structuralism (per [[Leonard Bloomfield]]) for example. This particular approach to the study of language is also often referred to as [[Generative linguistics]], which is attributed to Chomsky and his early [[generative grammar]] work.

====Universal grammar====
There are several concepts important to the Chomskyan (or generativist) approach to linguistics. The most fundamental of these ideas is the theory of [[universal grammar]] (UG). Simply put, and as implied by the name, UG refers to those grammatical properties thought to be shared by all (to be universal to all) derivations of human language (anything from [[Amharic]] to [[Standard Zhuang|Zhuang]]).

Per this conceptualization, UG is innate to all humans – people come "pre-wired" with this universal grammatical structure. A person's individual grammar (that which is unique to the person) develops from the interaction between the innate universal grammar and input from the environment, or primary linguistic data. This "analytic triplet" (McGilvray, ed., 2005, p. 51), UG + input = grammar, is the functional core of the theory.

;Language acquisition
Several questions (or problems) motivate linguistic theorizing and investigation. Two such taken up in Chomskyan linguistics are the process of [[language acquisition]] in children, and "Plato's Problem". These subjects are interrelated and viewed as evidence in support of the theory of UG.

One of the simplest ways to approach the concept of universal grammar is to pose a hypothetical question about an aspect of language acquisition in children – why does a child learn the language that it does. As a specific example, how can a child of Asian descent (say, born of Chinese parents) be set down in the middle of Topeka, Kansas and acquire "perfect English?" The answer is that the child does not start with "[[Chinese language|Chinese]]", or any other conventionally defined language, in its head. The child does start with general grammatical rules that determine linguistic properties.

Children come equipped with universal grammar, from which any natural human language will develop – without instruction. All that is needed is passive input during the critical period—defined in linguistics as that period within which a child must have necessary and sufficient exposure to human language so that language acquisition occurs; without sufficient exposure to primary linguistic data, the UG does not have the necessary input for development of an individual grammar; this period is commonly recognized as spanning from birth to adolescence, generally up to the age of 12 years, though individual variations are possible. If what the child predominantly hears (or sees via sign) as it is maturing through this critical period is the English spoken in Topeka, Kansas, then that is what the child will acquire. This is why, regardless of a child's ethnic/racial background (or any other non-relevant factor, the child will know Cockney English, [[Egyptian Arabic]], or [[isiZulu]] if the child's primary linguistic input is Cockney English, Egyptian Arabic, or isiZulu, respectively.

The hypothetical question posed addresses a common misconception about what is instantiated in the mind/brain of an individual when it comes to language. It does not address the "logical problem" of language acquisition, i.e., how children transition from ostensibly having no knowledge of language to having full knowledge, in what may be described as a very limited time with apparently limited input.

;Plato's problem

To address the issue of apparently limited input, one must turn to what is possibly the most quoted of all arguments in support of universal grammar and its [[Universal grammar|nativist]] interpretation – Plato's Problem. The phrase refers to the Socratic dialogue, the Meno; [[Noam Chomsky]] is often attributed with coining the term.

Noam Chomsky's 1986 "'Knowledge of Language' begins with informal characterization of 'Plato's Problem:  The problem of explaining how we can know so much given so little evidence.'"&lt;ref&gt;Edward Stabler, Philosophy of Science,  Review of Nom Chomsky, 'Knowledge of Language:  Its nature origin and use,' Vol.56 No.3 1989 Pp.533-536 University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Book is organized around a discussion of Plato's problem [Chomsky] quoting Russell[:]"&lt;ref&gt;Norbert Hornstein, Philosophical Review, Reviewing Noam Chomsky 1986, 'Knowledge of Language,' Vol.97 No.4 1988 Pp.567-573 Duke Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato’s Problem was expressed generally by Bertrand Russell: "How comes it that human beings, whose contacts with the world are brief and personal and limited, are nevertheless able to know as much as they do know?" The problem arises in the domain of language acquisition in that children attain infinitely more than they experience. Literally so, we shall see: they attain a productive system, a grammar, on the basis of very little experience. So there is more, much more, to language acquisition than mimicking what we hear in childhood, and there is more to it than the simple transmission of a set of words and sentences from one generation of speakers to the next. There is more to it than a reproduction of experience and, in maturity, our capacity goes well beyond what we have experienced.
Consider some subtleties that people are not consciously aware of. The verb is may be used in its full form or its reduced form: people say Kim is happy or Kim’s happy. However, certain instances of is never reduce, for example, the underlined items in Kim is happier than Tim is or I wonder what the problem is in Washington. Most people are not aware of this, but we all know subconsciously not to use the reduced form here. How did we come to this? The question arises because the eventual knowledge is richer than relevant experience. As children, we heard instances of the full form and the reduced form, but we were not instructed to avoid the reduced form in certain places; we had no access to "negative data," information about what does not occur.&lt;ref&gt;David Lightfoot, 2007:  The Cambridge Companion to Chomsky, Chapter 2 - Plato’s Problem, UG, and the language organ pp. 42-59&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato's Problem particularly refers to a point in the dialogue when Socrates is talking with an uneducated servant and shows, through this interaction, that the servant knows the Pythagorean Theorem though he has never been explicitly taught any geometry. How does the servant know without having ever been taught? Plato's suggestion is, essentially, that people have innate knowledge.

In the field of linguistics, Plato's Problem is the problem of finding an explanation for how a child acquires language though the child does not receive explicit instruction and the primary linguistic data a child does receive is limited. This PLD is the input, or stimuli, from the environment, necessary for the development of an individual's grammar – language – via input into UG. This limited environmental stimulus is referred to as [[poverty of the stimulus]]. Specifically, the stimuli to which children are exposed during the critical period do not encompass every lawful example of grammatical structure relevant to the particular language.

For instance, consider that a child might hear the following examples:

  Who do you think that Jack will kiss first?
  Who do you think      Jack will kiss first?

From this, the child might determine that the word that is optional and from this analogize to the following examples:

  Who do you think      will kiss Jill first?
 *Who do you think that will kiss Jill first?

Clearly, the second example is not a grammatically well-formed sentence in English. A child knows this and does not form sentences such as the one marked by the asterisk. How does the child know, without being explicitly taught, that the ungrammatical example is, in fact, ungrammatical? From the linguistic perspective being described here, the answer to this question is that such knowledge pre-exists as part of UG.

Plato's Problem describes the disparity between input (poverty of the stimulus) and output (grammar). As Plato suggests in the Meno dialogue, the bridge between input (whether limited or lacking) and output is innate knowledge. Poverty of the stimulus is crucial to the Platonic argument and it is a linchpin concept in Chomskyan linguistics. For this reason, Plato's Problem is often used synonymously to mean poverty of the stimulus. Specific to linguistics, the formulation of this problem is evidence for the existence of universal grammar. Plato's Problem, as conceived here, informs much of the theory in this branch of linguistics.

===Perception and attention===
There have been studies of [[perception]] and [[attention]] that support the idea that there is an abundance of knowledge available to an individual at any given moment (Blake &amp; Sekuler, 2006).

====Visual====
A key ingredient to the beginning stages of perception requires the attention of the observer on some focal point or stimulus. There is a [[presupposition]] that if one visually perceives an object, one knows that one is seeing it (excluding the exception of perceptual illusions). Whatever sensory stimuli are attended to can be declared knowledge.

Stimuli that are directly attended to are projected onto the [[Fovea centralis|fovea]], the central point of the retina that corresponds to the focal point in visual space. To the immediate left and right of the focal point is the portion of visual space attributed to [[binocular vision]]. The far left and right of one's visual space is attributed to the monocular vision of the left and right eyes. In sum, one's visual space covers roughly 200° from the periphery of the left eye to the periphery of the right eye. This large visual space in human beings is a result of a fully developed and functioning anatomical visual system. In the context of Plato's Problem, our visual system is an innate capacity that enables us to be aware of a considerable portion of our immediate environment which enhances our conscious experience by supplementing it with an extensive environmental awareness and predisposing us to extract meaningful perceptual information. In other words, it is our biologically produced visual system that makes our perceptual experiences meaningful.

====Auditory====
Some examples from auditory perception research will be helpful in explaining the fact that our perceptual faculties naturally enhance and supplement our conscious experience. First, there is the "cocktail party phenomenon" (Moray, 1959). When someone is engaged in conversation with a group of people in a noisy room, but then they suddenly hear something or hear their name from across the room, when they were completely inattentive to the input before, that is the cocktail party phenomenon. This phenomenon also occurs with words associated with danger and sex. Although people may be inattentive to a portion of their environment, when they hear specific "trigger" words, their auditory capacities are redirected to another dimension of perceptual awareness. This shows that we do process information outside of our immediate conscious experience. Similar to visual perception, auditory perception also enhances and supplements our experience by searching out and extracting meaningful information from our environment.

The auditory findings are further concretized by research on shadowing tasks (Cherry, 1966). These tasks involve two distinct auditory messages presented simultaneously to both ears. One message in one ear is supposed to be shadowed (repeated) while the other message in the other ear is supposed to be ignored. Participants generally perform well at repeating familiar messages in the attended channel. However, when there was a significant change in [[frequency]] in the message in the unattended channel, it was detected; moreover, when their names were presented in the unattended channel, they noticed that as well. These shadowing tasks reinforce the idea that the gap between knowledge and experience is explained by our innate perceptual capacities that enhance our experience and optimize our knowledge gained from our environment.

====Subliminal priming====
There is also the subject of subliminal priming (Nisbett &amp; Ross, 1980), in which a stimulus is perceived outside of conscious awareness.  For example, in an experiment, half of a class was presented with a picture of a boy holding a birthday cake, while the other half was presented with a different picture of the same boy holding a birthday cake. The sole difference between the two was that in the first picture the boy had a mischievous facial expression, while in the second he conveyed an innocent smile. The photos were presented in a flash of 100 ms, then another picture was presented to both groups with the boy smiling. Results were that the first group described him as devilish and naughty, and the second group depicted him as angelic and kind. Due to the short presentation of the pictures, the subjects were not consciously aware of the nature of the original photos and when presented with them afterwards, participants were surprised.

These studies point to the fact that even though we only attend to and process limited information, we have a vast amount of knowledge at our disposal through our highly unrestricted sensory registers. It is the selective attention, perception, and higher order cognitive processing that limits these inputs and it is precisely these processes that make up our conscious awareness. Thus, in order to formulate some explanations for Plato's Problem, our conscious awareness limits our experience; nevertheless, it seems as though some stimuli that are sensed by our sensory registers, although seemingly rejected by conscious awareness, are actually retained and abstracted into our memories for further processing. All of our fully functioning perceptual faculties enhance, supplement, and optimize our experiences.

===Long-term memory (LTM)===

This LTM availability/accessibility dichotomy is analogous to a more contemporary explanation of Plato's doctrine of reminiscence, which postulates that an individual hedge as a result of information carried over from past lives. While evidence for or against [[immortality]] is outside the bounds of scientific research, one can see similarities between LTM availability/accessibility and the doctrine of reminiscence. LTM availability is highly unrestricted and practically unlimited as a storage system while LTM accessibility corresponds to what we can actually recall at any given moment. Plato, through his doctrine of reminiscence, would say that knowledge available through reminiscence is practically unrestricted but we are not cognizant of many of those ideas because they have yet to be recalled.

==Implications==
Having discussed Plato's philosophy, linguistics, perception, and some cognitive structures, various implications that arise from the research and theorizing can be touched on. The debate surrounding how to define knowledge goes back to the origin of humanity. In historical philosophy, the debate has been between [[rationalism]] and [[empiricism]]. In contemporary psychology, the debate is between biology (nature) and environment (nurture).

Rationalism is a philosophical and epistemological perspective on knowledge that claims, at its most extreme, that reason is the only dependable source of knowledge; moreover, rationalists assert that ''a priori'' knowledge is the most effective foundation for knowledge [http://www.philosophypages.com/dy/index.htm]. Empiricism, on the other hand, argues that no knowledge exists prior to experience; therefore, all knowledge, as well as thought, comes from experience. The [[nature and nurture]] debate is not identical, and yet has similarities, or parallels, to the rationalism versus empiricism debate. Those who claim that thought and behavior result from nature say the cause is genetic predisposition while those who argue for environment say that thought and behavior are caused by learning, parenting, and socialization.

In contemporary philosophical, linguistic, and psychological circles, it is rare that anyone maintains an unwavering stance on either of these extremes, most fall toward the middle. For many, the ideas of "nature and nurture" or "innateness and environmental input" are no longer perceived as mutually exclusive. For those who research such topics, much points to a necessarily interactive relationship in order for thought and behavior to occur.

In Plato's philosophy, innate ideas are revealed through the Socratic Method of investigation. In linguistics, universal grammar must have input from the environment (primary linguistic data) in order for children to achieve an individual grammar (output). Biologically, our perceptual faculties are pre-wired, but they require environmental stimuli in order to develop correctly. The neurological structures in our brain that represent the location of LTM are also biologically pre-wired, yet environmental input is needed in order for memory to flourish.

All of these ideas speak to the crux of Plato's Problem, which is how to account for the gap between knowledge and limited experience. For some scientific and philosophical disciplines, the answer to this conundrum is innateness, or biological pre-wiring. Innate knowledge is what bridges the gap between the limited information one gleans from the environment (poverty of the stimulus) and one's actual knowledge.

'''Rachel Albeck-Gidron''' (born 1960) is an Israeli inter-disciplinary researcher of  Hebrew and comparative [[literature]], [[philosophy]] and [[art]].

==Research==
In her book, ''The Century of the Monads'', Albeck-Gidron claims that there is a deep similarity and even a relationship between [[monadology|monadic]] [[metaphysics]] and the basic assumptions of [[modernism|modernistic]] thought. This claim is demonstrated in 20th-century scientific thought patterns, in the central movements in plastic art from the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century and, particularly, in the world view of the [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]] [[novel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Rachel |last=Albeck-Gidron |title=The Century of the Monads: Leibniz's Metaphysics and 20th-Century Modernity |location= |publisher=Bar-Ilan University Press |isbn= |year= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also developed a theoretical model of describing  the process of creation of  textual-versions and created a method of comparing between them, named 'the third text'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Rachel |last=Albeck-Gidron |title=The 3rd text – a theoretical and methodological principle in comparative research, and its application in comparison of the versions of Berdyczewski's story 'Urva Parch' |journal=Sadan |volume=4 |year=2000 |issue= |pages=323–352 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albeck-Gidron examines the [[Ashkenaz]]i [[Pronunciation]] of [[Hebrew]] as a [[Postmodernism|Postmodernistic]] Question, in a part of a [[sociological]] discussion in a problem known as 'invention of tradition'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Rachel |last=Albeck-Gidron |title=Exiled and Suppressed Voices: On the Ashkenazi Pronunciation of Hebrew as a Postmodernistic Question |journal=Jerusalem Studies in Hebrew Literature |volume=19 |issue= |year=2003 |pages=69–90 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also analyzed the work of [[Yoel Hoffmann]] in the light of western and eastern poetics.

Albeck-Gidron is Associate professor of Hebrew literature at [[Bar Ilan University]] in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biu.ac.il/faculty/tomy/&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2007, she has been appointed as visiting associate professor at [[Stanford University]] and taught the course "East West East in Israeli Literature: The Novels of Yoel Hoffmann".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stanford.edu/dept/jewishstudies/people/scholars_2006_07.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18886">'''Reflectivism''' is a broad [[Umbrella term|umbrella label]], used primarily in [[International relations theory|International Relations theory]], for a range of theoretical approaches which oppose [[Rational choice|rational-choice]] accounts of social phenomena and, perhaps, [[positivism]] more generally.  The label was popularised by [[Robert Keohane]] in his presidential address to the [[International Studies Association]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;The attribution to Keohane is standard -- see e.g. Milja Kurki, ''Causation in International Relations: Reclaiming Causal Analysis''.  Cambridge University Press (2008), p. 124 n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The address was entitled "International Institutions: Two Approaches", and contrasted two broad approaches to the study of [[international institution]]s (and international phenomena more generally).  One was "rationalism", the other what Keohane referred to as "reflectivism".  Rationalists — including [[Realism (international relations)|realists]], [[Neorealism (international relations)|neo-realists]], [[Liberalism (international relations)|liberals]], [[Neoliberalism in international relations|neo-liberals]], and scholars using [[Game theory|game-theoretic]] or [[Expected utility|expected-utility]] [[Economic model|models]] — are theorists who adopt the broad theoretical and [[ontological]] commitments of [[Rational choice theory|rational-choice theory]].

== Rationalism vs. reflectivism ==
Keohane characterised rationalism in the following fashion:

:[Rationalists accept] what [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] has referred to a "substantive" conception of rationality, characterizing "behaviour that can be adjudged objectively to be [[Optimal decision|optimally]] adapted to the situation" (Simon, 1985:294).  As Simon has argued, the principle of [[Decision-making models#Rationality|substantive rationality]] generates hypotheses about actual human behaviour only when it is combined with certain [[Duhem–Quine thesis|auxiliary]] [[Scientific theory#Assumptions in formulating theories|assumptions]] about the structure of [[utility function]]s and the formation of expectations.

:Since this research program is rooted in [[exchange theory]], it assumes [[scarcity]] and competition as well as [[rationality]] on the part of the actors.  Rationalistic theories of [[institution]]s view institutions as affecting patterns of [[Cost#Comparing private, external, social, and psychic costs|costs]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert O. Keohane, "International Institutions: Two Approaches", ''International Studies Quarterly'' 32, 4 (Dec. 1988), pp. 381, 386.&lt;/ref&gt;

Keohane went on to contrast this with the approach of "reflective" scholars:
:These authors, of whom the best-known include [[Hayward Alker]], [[Richard K. Ashley|Richard Ashley]], [[Friedrich Kratochwil]], and [[John Ruggie]], emphasize the importance of the "[[Intersubjectivity|intersubjective]] meanings" of international institutional activity (Kratochwil and Ruggie, 1986:765).  In their view, understanding how people think about institutional [[Social norms|norms]] and rules, and the [[discourse]] they engage in, is as important in evaluating the significance of these norms as measuring the behavior that changes in response to their invocation.

:These writers emphasize that individuals, local organizations, and even states develop within the context of more encompassing institutions.  Institutions do not merely reflect the [[Preference (economics)|preferences]] and power of the units constituting them; the institutions themselves shape those preferences and that power.  Institutions are therefore constitutive of actors as well as vice versa.  It is therefore not sufficient in this view to treat the preferences of individuals as given [[exogenous]]ly: they are affected by institutional arrangements, by prevailing norms, and by historically contingent discourse among people seeking to pursue their purposes and solve their self-defined problems.

:[I]t would be fair to refer to them as "[[Verstehen|interpretive]]" scholars, since they all emphasize the importance of historical and textual interpretation and the limitations of [[Scientific modelling|scientific models]] in studying world politics. But other approaches also have a right to be considered [[Antipositivism|interpretive]]. I have therefore coined a phrase for these writers, calling them "reflective", since all of them emphasize the importance of human reflection for the nature of institutions and ultimately for the character of world politics.&lt;ref&gt;Keohane, "International Institutions", pp. 381-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflectivism and rationalism are typically used as labels applying not just to the study of international institutions, but of international relations more widely, and even the social world as a whole.  Sociologies and histories of the International Relations discipline have sometimes used the opposition between these approaches to describe one of the central fault-lines within the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Ole Waever, "The Rise and Fall of the Inter-Paradigm Debate", in Steve Smith, Ken Booth and Marysia Zalewski (eds.), ''International Theory: Positivism and Beyond''.  Cambridge University Press (1996), pp. 164-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reflexivity ==
There may be another sense, not specifically discussed by Keohane, in which the label is apt. Reflectivist scholars tend to emphasise the inherent [[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]] both of theory and of the social world it studies.  Unlike the term ''reflectivism'', the concept of [[Reflexivity (social theory)|"reflexivity"]] has wide currency outside of international relations, having come to prominence in [[social theory]] in the latter part of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Prominent early works in social theory developing the theme of reflexivity include Anthony Giddens, ''The Constitution of Society: Outline of the Theory of Structuration''.  Polity (1984); [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and Loïc Wacquant, ''An Invitation to Reflexive Sociology''.  University of Chicago Press (1992); and Ulrich Beck, ''Risk Society: Towards a New Modernity''.  SAGE (1992 [1986]).&lt;/ref&gt; Reflexivity refers to the ways in which elements and phenomena in social life have the capacity to "fold in on", or be "directed towards", themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Similar imagery is used by Matthew Eagleton-Pierce, "Examining the Case for Reflexivity in International Relations: Insights from Bourdieu", ''Journal of Critical Globalisation Studies'' 1 (2009), p. 111–12.  Another explicit analysis of reflexivity in IR, also inspired by the social theory of Pierre Bourdieu, is Anna Leander, "Do We Really Need Reflexivity in IPE? Bourdieu's Two Reasons for Answering Affirmatively", ''Review of International Political Economy'' 9, 4 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; That is, they can produce effects on, or have implications for, their own features, dynamics and existence. An example is the "[[self-fulfilling prophecy]]" (or "self-disconfirming prophecy")&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Ido Oren, "Can Political Science Emulate the Natural Sciences? The Problem of Self-Disconfirming Analysis", ''Polity'' 38, 1 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; — a situation in which merely describing, predicting, imagining or believing something to be the case may eventually result in its actually coming to be the case.&lt;ref&gt;In IR, see e.g. David Patrick Houghton, "The Role of Self-Fulfilling and Self-Negating Prophecies in International Relations", ''International Studies Review'' 11, 3 (2009); Robert Jervis, ''System Effects: Complexity in Political and Social Life''.  Princeton University Press (1997), pp. 60, 148–50.&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, reflectivists emphasise the significance of human [[self-awareness]]: the ways people observe, imagine, describe, predict and theorise about themselves and the social reality around them, and the [[wikt:recursive|recursive]] effect this "self-knowledge" or these "reflections" have on that social reality itself.  Some scholars link reflexivity with [[Structure and agency|the broader debate]], within International Relations theory and social theory more generally, over the relationship between "[[Agency (sociology)|agency]]" and "[[Social structure|structure]]" in the social world.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Kate O'Neill, Jörg Balsiger and Stacy VanDeveer, "Actors, Norms and Impact: Recent International Cooperation Theory and the Influence of the Agent-Structure Debate", ''Annual Review of Political Science'' 7 (2004); Alexander Wendt, "The Agent-Structure Problem in International Relations Theory", ''International Organization'' 41, 3 (1987), p. 359; Daniel Mügge, "Reflexivity in Global Finance: How Agency Matters to Market Change", GARNET Working Paper #14/07 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the relationship between people's capacity to "freely" choose their actions and/or to "make a real difference" to the world around them, and the social "[[Social structure|structures]]" in which people are always embedded, and which may powerfully shape – often against their will or in ways they are unaware of – the kinds of things they are able to do.

Reflectivists also often claim that studying and ''theorising'' about international relations can be, should be, and are necessarily, reflexive. For one thing, they claim, theories about social reality may affect – might change – social reality itself.&lt;ref&gt;A point emphasised, among many others, by Brent J. Steele, ''Ontological Security in International Relations: Self-Identity and the IR State''.  Routledge (2008), pp. 150, 160-64 and passim.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics of (neo-)realism have raised the possibility that realist theories, for instance, may act as [[Self-fulfilling prophecy|self-fulfilling prophecies]].  To the extent that they are taken by theorists and practitioners to be the "common sense" of international politics, diplomacy and policy-making, those theories may encourage precisely the kind of mistrust, ruthless competition and amorality that they posit to be natural and inherent features of the international realm.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Annette Freyburg-Inan, ''What Moves Man: The Realist Theory of International Relations and Its Judgment of Human Nature''. SUNY Press (2003); Alexander Wendt, ''Social Theory of International Politics''.  Cambridge University Press (1999), pp. 368-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Familiar methodological examples of the capacity of observation and theorising to affect the object/phenomena of study include the "[[observer-expectancy effect]]" and long-running concerns among anthropologists and ethnographers over the possible effect of [[Participant observer#Impact of researcher involvement|participant observation]] on the very people and behaviours being studied.

Furthermore, reflectivists argue, those theories invariably reflect in important ways the social context in which they were produced; so in a sense the social world shapes the theories made of it.&lt;ref&gt;One detailed empirical study is Ido Oren, ''Our Enemies and Us: America's Rivalries and the Making of Political Science''.  Cornell UP (2003); see also Oren, "Is Culture Independent of National Security? How America's National Security Concerns Shaped 'Political Culture' Research", ''European Journal of International Relations'' 6, 4 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; There is often a [[normative]] or ethical aspect to the emphasis on reflexivity.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Brooke Ackerly and Jacqui True, "Reflexivity in Practice: Power and Ethics in Feminist Research on International Relations", ''International Studies Review'' 10, 4 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Reflectivists often argue that theorists should be as self-aware as possible — to reflect as much as possible on the influences ([[Presupposition|assumptions]], [[bias]]es, normative commitments, etc.) that feed into and shape the theories they produce.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Mark Neufeld, "Reflexivity and International Relations Theory", ''Millennium'' 22, 1 (1993), p. 55ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, they should be able to [[Reflexivity (social theory)#Overview|hold their own theories]] to the standards and arguments they set out in those same theories.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Inanna Hamati-Ataya, "The 'Problem of Values' and International Relations Scholarship: From Applied Reflexivity to Reflexivism", ''International Studies Review'' 13, 2 (2011); Christian Büger, "Paradigms, Cultures and Translations: Seven Ways of Studying the Discipline of International Relations", paper presented at the Annual Convention of the International Studies Association, Chicago (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; And finally, they should reflect on the likely and possible effects of their theorising.  Some reflectivists (e.g. those of a [[Poststructuralism|post-structuralist]] persuasion) have argued that theorising should itself be understood as a [[Practice (social theory)|practice]], like the human practices that theories study; that it is an act (conscious or unconscious) of intervention into social reality, and that as such it is never "innocent" or "neutral", and there is a degree of responsibility for its consequences that theorists cannot (and should not try to) escape.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Marysia Zalewski, "'All These Theories yet the Bodies Keep Piling Up': Theories, Theorists, Theorising", in Smith, Booth and Zalewski (eds.), ''International Theory: Positivism and Beyond'', pp. 340-53; Steve Smith, "Singing Our World into Existence: International Relations Theory and September 11", ''International Studies Quarterly'' 48, 3 (2004); Jack Amoureux and Brent Steele, ''Reflexivity and International Relations''. Routledge Press (2016); Jack Amoureux, ''A Practice of Ethics for Global Politics: Ethical Reflexivity''. Routledge Press (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reflectivism and post-positivism ==
Reflectivist approaches include such approaches as [[Constructivism (international relations)|constructivism]], [[Feminist theory|feminism]], [[Poststructuralism|post-structuralism]], [[Postcolonialism|post-colonialism]] and [[Critical Theory]].  The challenge launched by these approaches against rationalist approaches, which have largely dominated the IR discipline for the past three decades, was linked to the "Third Debate in International Relations"&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Lapid, "The Third Debate: On the Prospects of International Theory in a Post-Positivist Era", ''International Studies Quarterly'' 33, 3 (Sept. 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; between [[Positivism|positivists]] and [[Postpositivism|post-positivists]]/[[Antipositivism|anti-positivists]]. (The first two disciplinary "Great Debates" are supposed to have pitted (1) [[Realism (international relations)|realists]] vs. so-called "[[Idealism in international relations theory|idealists]]", and (2) [[Behavioralism|behaviouralists]] vs. so-called "traditionalists", the latter favouring historical methods and insights from [[political philosophy]].) Although the large majority of reflectivists oppose [[Positivism#Positivism in science today|positivism]], it might be a mistake to equate reflectivism with post-positivism or anti-positivism, as [[Constructivism (international relations)#Recent developments|(conventional) constructivists]] who are positivist in orientation would nevertheless fall under Keohane's description.  Confusion may be compounded by the fact that in International Relations theory, rationalism&lt;ref&gt;On which, see e.g. Miles Kahler, "Rationality in International Relations", ''International Organization'' 52, 4 (Autumn 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; and positivism can often be (erroneously) equated.&lt;ref&gt;That positivism and rationalism are not synonymous is noted e.g. by Milja Kurki and Colin Wight, "International Relations and Social Science", in Timothy Dunne, Milja Kurki and Steve Smith (eds.), ''International Relations Theories: Discipline and Diversity''.  Oxford University Press (2007), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many positivist political scientists who do not adopt [[Rational choice theory|rational-choice]] assumptions.

Some mainstream International Relations scholars, dismissing the importance or value of non-positivist approaches to social science, have reframed the rationalism-reflectivism debate narrowly, as a debate between [[Rationalist-constructivist debate|rationalism and ("conventional") constructivism]], construed as the two major [[Social theory|social theories]] (or "[[Ontology|ontologies]]") of (mainstream) International Relations theory. The rationalism-constructivism debate drew considerable attention within the mainstream at the turn of the 21st century, with some rejecting the starkness of the opposition itself and asserting a fundamental compatibility, or possibility of synthesis, between the two approaches.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. James Fearon and Alexander Wendt, "Rationalism v. Constructivism: A Skeptical View", in Walter Carlsnaes, Thomas Risse and Beth Simmons (eds.), ''Handbook of International Relations'', 1st edn. SAGE (2002), pp. 52-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of reflectivist approaches==
The main criticisms of reflectivist approaches stem from the [[epistemology|epistemological]] differences between reflectivism and what in the social sciences has come to be known as [[positivism]]. Since the 1970s, mainstream International Relations theory has become increasingly, and more insistently, positivist in epistemological orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Maliniak, Amy Oakes, Susan Peterson and Michael J. Tierney, "The International Relations Discipline, 1980-2006", paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Political Science Association, Chicago (2007), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The typical reflectivist rejection of positivist assumptions and methods has led to criticism that the approach cannot make reliable statements about the outside world and even that it has repudiated the entire "social science enterprise".&lt;ref&gt;In reference to "postmodernism", for example, see Peter Katzenstein, Robert Keohane and Stephen Krasner, "International Organization at Fifty: Exploration and Contestation in the Study of World Politics", ''International Organization'' 52, 4 (Autumn 1998), p. 678.&lt;/ref&gt; Such criticisms are widespread in American political science, and reflectivism is not generally popular in U.S.-based IR scholarship, especially when compared with scholarship originating in Europe and the third world.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Ole Waever, "The Sociology of a Not So International Discipline:  American and European Developments in International Relations", ''International Organization'' 52, 4 (1998); Thomas Biersteker, "The Parochialism of Hegemony:  Challenges for 'American' International Relations", in Arlene Tickner and Ole Waever (eds.), ''International Relations Scholarship Around the World:  Worlding Beyond the West''.  Routledge (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8780">'''Somaesthetics''' is an interdisciplinary field of inquiry aimed at promoting and integrating the theoretical, empirical and practical disciplines related to bodily perception, performance and presentation.

== Etymology ==
The term ‘somaesthetics’ was coined by the American pragmatist philosopher [[Richard Shusterman]] in 1996 through the compounding of “soma”, an expression derived from the Greek word for body, and “[[aesthetics]]”, a word derived from the Greek ''aesthesis'', meaning ‘sensory perception’.&lt;ref&gt;While Shusterman was the first to use 'somaesthetics' in reference to a philosophical discipline, a form of the term had been in use within the neurological sciences as an alternate label for the somatosensory cortex, i.e. the somaesthetic cortex. In American English, this alternate label is usually rendered with a different spelling: somesthetic.&lt;/ref&gt; Shusterman has reported in a number of his works that he chose ‘soma’ over more familiar terms “to avoid problematic associations of body (which can be a lifeless, mindless thing) and flesh (which designates only the fleshly parts of the body and is strongly associated with Christian notions of sin)” and to emphasize that the project “concerns the lived, sentient, purposive body rather than merely a physical body”.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shusterman|first1=Richard|title=Somaesthetics|url=https://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/somaesthetics.html|website=Encyclopedia of Human-Computer Interaction|publisher=Interaction Design Foundation|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an amalgamation, ‘somaesthetics’ “implies a project of appreciating and cultivating the body not only as an object that externally displays beauty, sublimity, grace, and other aesthetic qualities, but also as a subjectivity that perceives these qualities and that experiences attendant aesthetic pleasures somatically”.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Origin and development ==
Somaesthetics as a research project initially arose from the work of Richard Shusterman during the mid-1990s in response to what he perceived as needed developments within his two principal modes of inquiry: pragmatist aesthetics and philosophy as an embodied art of living. While pragmatist aesthetics, according to Shusterman, advocates for more active and creative engagement than traditional aesthetics, he believed it should also recognize that artistic, practical and political action requires humanity’s primary tool, the body, and that such action could be improved partly by improving this instrument.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shusterman|first1=Richard|title=Somaesthetics|url=https://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/somaesthetics.html|website=Encyclopedia of Human-Computer Interaction|publisher=Interaction Design Foundation|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way, the philosophical life could be improved through greater mastery of the soma -- our medium of living. He moreover lamented the reduction of aesthetics (as well as philosophy itself) from “a noble art of living into a minor, specialized university discipline” narrowly concerned with beauty and fine art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shusterman|first1=Richard|title=Somaesthetics: A Disciplinary Proposal|journal=Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|date=Summer 1999|volume=57|issue=3|page=301|url=http://www.staff.amu.edu.pl/~ewa/Somaesthetics.pdf|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shusterman thus argued for the revival of “[[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten]]’s idea of aesthetics as a life-improving cognitive discipline that extends far beyond questions of beauty and fine arts and that involves both theory and practical exercise” and for an end to “the neglect of the body that Baumgarten disastrously introduced into aesthetics”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=ibid.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As proposed, Shusterman’s project of somaesthetics would restore “the soma — the living, sentient, purposive body — as the indispensable medium for all perception".&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Such heightening of somatic consciousness would not only enhance artistic appreciation and creation, but increase the perceptual awareness of meanings and feelings that have the potential to elevate everyday experience into an art of living.

Shusterman proposed three fundamental dimensions of his emerging field:
&lt;br /&gt;
• Analytic somaesthetics, as the most theoretically-oriented of the three, “describes the basic nature of bodily perceptions and practices and also of their function in our knowledge and construction of reality”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shusterman|first1=Richard|title=Somaesthetics: A Disciplinary Proposal|journal=Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|date=Summer 1999|volume=57|issue=3|page=304|url=http://www.staff.amu.edu.pl/~ewa/Somaesthetics.pdf|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
• Pragmatic somaesthetics presupposes the analytic dimension and “has a distinctly normative, prescriptive character – by proposing specific methods of somatic improvement and engaging in their comparative critique”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shusterman|first1=Richard|title=Somaesthetics: A Disciplinary Proposal|journal=Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|date=Summer 1999|volume=57|issue=3|pages=304–305|url=http://www.staff.amu.edu.pl/~ewa/Somaesthetics.pdf|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
• Practical somaesthetics focuses on practicing somatic care “through intelligently disciplined body work aimed at somatic self-improvement (whether in a representational, experiential, or performative mode)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shusterman|first1=Richard|title=Somaesthetics: A Disciplinary Proposal|journal=Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|date=Summer 1999|volume=57|issue=3|page=307|url=http://www.staff.amu.edu.pl/~ewa/Somaesthetics.pdf|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past two decades, somaesthetics has become a truly interdisciplinary endeavor. Originally conceived by Shusterman as being under the umbrella of [[philosophy]], or perhaps even a branch of [[aesthetics]], somaesthetics has evolved into an “open field for collaborative, interdisciplinary, and transcultural inquiry” with applications “ranging from the arts, product design, and politics to fashion, health, sports, martial arts, and the use of hallucinogenic drugs in education”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shusterman|first1=Richard|title=Somaesthetics|url=https://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/somaesthetics.html#heading_Genealogy_and_Emergence_page_107797|website=Encyclopedia of Human-Computer Interaction|publisher=Interaction Design Foundation|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Anti-Œdipus Papers''''' is a collection of journal entries and notes written between 1969 and 1973&lt;ref&gt;Nadaud (2006, 11)&lt;/ref&gt; by the French philosopher and psychotherapist [[Félix Guattari]]. These notes, addressed to [[Gilles Deleuze]] by Guattari in preparation for ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972), serve to substantiate their claims, finally bringing out the factory behind the theatre. They reveal Guattari as an inventive, highly analytical, mathematically-minded “conceptor,” arguably one of the most prolific and enigmatic figures in philosophy and sociopolitical theory today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Anti-Œdipus Papers|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/anti-%C5%93dipus-papers|website=The Anti-Œdipus Papers|publisher=The MIT Press|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though as a whole, the papers serve to expand upon, and propose their own, psychoanalytic theory, they are supplemented by journal entries explaining the relationships between Guattari and many of his companions including Deleuze, [[Jacques Lacan]], and [[Jean Oury]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20707">The '''von Neumann–Wigner interpretation''', also described as "'''consciousness causes collapse''' [of the wave function]", is an [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretation of quantum mechanics]] in which [[consciousness]] is postulated to be necessary for the completion of the process of [[measurement in quantum mechanics|quantum measurement]].

== Background: observation in quantum mechanics ==
In the orthodox [[Copenhagen interpretation]], quantum mechanics predicts only the probabilities for different outcomes of pre-specified observations. What constitutes an "observer" or an "observation" is not directly specified by the theory, and the behavior of a system upon observation is completely different than its usual behavior: the wavefunction that describes a system spreads out into an ever-larger superposition of different possible situations. However, during observation, the wavefunction describing the system collapses to one of several options. If there is no observation, this collapse does not occur, and none of the options ever becomes less likely.

It can be predicted using quantum mechanics, absent a collapse postulate, that an observer observing a quantum superposition will turn into a superposition of different observers seeing different things. The observer will have a wavefunction which describes all the possible outcomes. Still, in actual experience, an observer never senses a superposition, but always senses that one of the outcomes has occurred with certainty. This apparent conflict between a wavefunction description and classical experience is called the problem of observation (see [[Measurement problem]]).

== The interpretation ==

In his 1932 book ''The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics'', [[John von Neumann]] argued that the mathematics of quantum mechanics allows the [[Wave function collapse|collapse of the wave function]] to be placed at any position in the causal chain from the measurement device to the "subjective perception" of the human observer.  In 1939, [[Fritz London]] and Edmond Bauer argued for the latter boundary (consciousness).&lt;ref&gt;F. London and E. Bauer, "La théorie de l’observation en mécanique quantique" (1939), English translation in ''Quantum Theory and Measurement'', edited by J. A. Wheeler and W. H. Zurek, Princeton University, Princeton, 1983, pp. 217–259.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1960s, [[Eugene Wigner]]&lt;ref name="Wigner"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1119/1.1973829| volume = 35| issue = 12| pages = 1169–1170| last = Wigner| first = Eugene| author2 = Henry Margenau| title = Remarks on the Mind Body Question, in Symmetries and Reflections, Scientific Essays| journal = American Journal of Physics| accessdate = 2009-07-30| date = 1967| url = http://link.aip.org/link/?AJP/35/1169/1| bibcode = 1967AmJPh..35.1169W| archive-url = https://archive.is/20130112081842/http://link.aip.org/link/?AJP/35/1169/1| archive-date = 2013-01-12| dead-url = yes| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; reformulated the "[[Schrödinger's cat]]" [[thought experiment]] as "[[Wigner's friend]]" and proposed that the consciousness of an observer is the demarcation line that precipitates collapse of the wave function, independent of any realist interpretation.  See [[Wigner's friend#Consciousness and measurement|Consciousness and measurement]]. The non-physical mind is postulated to be the only true measurement apparatus.&lt;ref name=Schreiber&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9501014v5 Schreiber, Z. ''The Nine Lives of Schrödingers's Cat''].&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rudolf Peierls]] was also a proponent of this interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;P. C. W. Davies and J. R. Brown (editors), ''The Ghost in the Atom'', Cambridge University Press, 1986, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

This interpretation has been summarized thus:&lt;ref name=Schreiber/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The rules of quantum mechanics are correct but there is only one system which may be treated with quantum mechanics, namely the entire material world. There exist external observers which cannot be treated within quantum mechanics, namely human (and perhaps animal) ''minds'', which perform [[quantum measurement|measurement]]s on the brain causing wave function collapse.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Henry Stapp]] has argued for the concept as follows:&lt;ref name="Stapp2001"&gt;{{cite journal |author=H. Stapp |title=Quantum Theory and the Role of Mind in Nature |journal=Foundations of Physics |volume=31 |issue=10 |pages=1465–1499 |year=2001 |doi=10.1023/A:1012682413597|arxiv=quant-ph/0103043 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
From the point of view of the mathematics of quantum theory it makes no sense to treat a measuring device as intrinsically different from the collection of atomic constituents that make it up. A device is just another part of the physical universe...  Moreover, the conscious thoughts of a human observer ought to be causally connected ''most directly and immediately'' to what is happening in his brain, not to what is happening out at some measuring device...  Our bodies and brains thus become ... parts of the quantum mechanically described physical universe. Treating the entire physical universe in this unified way provides a conceptually simple and logically coherent theoretical foundation...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Objections to the interpretation ==

There are other possible solutions to the "Wigner's friend" thought experiment, which do not require consciousness to be different from other physical processes.  Moreover, Wigner actually shifted to those interpretations (and away from "consciousness causes collapse") in his later years. This was partly because he was embarrassed that "consciousness causes collapse" can lead to a kind of [[solipsism]], but also because he decided that he had been wrong to try to apply quantum physics at the scale of everyday life (specifically, he rejected his initial idea of treating macroscopic objects as isolated systems).&lt;ref name=Esfeld&gt;Michael Esfeld, (1999), [http://www.unil.ch/webdav/site/philo/shared/DocsPerso/EsfeldMichael/1999/SHPMP99.pdf Essay Review: Wigner’s View of Physical Reality], published in Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics, 30B, pp. 145–154, Elsevier Science Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Wigner's friend#Consciousness and Superposition|Consciousness and Superposition]].

To many scientists this interpretation fails to compete with other [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]] because "consciousness causes collapse" relies upon an [[Interactionism (philosophy of mind)|interactionist]] form of [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] that is inconsistent with the [[materialism]] presupposed by many physicists.&lt;ref name=Schreiber/&gt; The [[measurement problem]] notwithstanding, they point to a [[Causal closure|causal closure of physics]], suggesting a problem with how consciousness and matter might interact, reminiscent of objections to Descartes' [[substance dualism]].

{{quote|The only form of [[interactionist dualism]] that has seemed even remotely tenable in the contemporary picture is one that exploits certain properties of quantum mechanics. There are two ways this might go. First, some [e.g., [[How the Self Controls Its Brain|Eccles 1986&amp;#x5D;]] have appealed to the existence of [[quantum indeterminacy]], and have suggested that a nonphysical consciousness might be responsible for filling the resultant causal gaps, [[determinism|determining]] which values some physical magnitudes might take within an apparently "[[probabilistic]]" distribution… This is an audacious and interesting suggestion, but it has a number of problems… A second way in which quantum mechanics bears on the issue of [[causal closure]] lies with the fact that in some [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretations of the quantum formalism]], consciousness itself plays a vital causal role, being required to bring about the so-called "[[wave function collapse|collapse of the wave-function]]." This collapse is supposed to occur upon any act of [[measurement in quantum mechanics|measurement]]; and in one interpretation, the only way to distinguish a measurement from a nonmeasurement is via the presence of consciousness. This theory is certainly not universally accepted (for a start, it ''presupposes'' that consciousness is not itself [[physicalism|physical]], surely contrary to the views of most physicists), and I do not accept it myself, but in any case it seems that the kind of causal work consciousness performs here is quite different from the kind required for consciousness to play a role in [[free will|directing behavior]]… In any case, all versions of interactionist dualism have a conceptual problem that suggests that they are less successful in avoiding [[epiphenomenalism]] than they might seem; or at least they are no better off than &amp;#x5B;[[naturalistic dualism]]&amp;#x5D;. Even on these views, there is a sense in which the [[phenomenalism|phenomenal]] is irrelevant. We can always subtract the phenomenal component from any explanatory account, yielding a purely [[causality|causal]] component.&lt;ref name="Chalmers1996"&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Chalmers |year=1996 |title=The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory |series=Philosophy of Mind Series |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=978-0-19-983935-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XtgiH-feUyIC&amp;pg=PA156 |pages=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[David Chalmers]]|"The Irreducibility of Consciousness" in ''The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory''}}

The interpretation has also been criticized for not explaining which things have sufficient consciousness to collapse the wave function. Also, it posits an important role for the conscious mind, and it has been questioned how this could be the case for the earlier universe, before consciousness had evolved or emerged.  It has been argued that "[consciousness causes collapse] does not allow sensible discussion of [[Big Bang]] cosmology or biological [[evolution]]".&lt;ref name=Schreiber/&gt; For example, [[Roger Penrose]] remarked: "[T]he evolution of conscious life on this planet is due to appropriate mutations having taken place at various times.  These, presumably, are quantum events, so they would exist only in linearly superposed form until they finally led to the evolution of a conscious being—whose very existence depends on all the right mutations having 'actually' taken place!"&lt;ref&gt;R. Penrose, ''The Emperor's New Mind'', Penguin Books, 1989, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others further suppose a universal mind (see also [[panpsychism]] and [[panexperientialism]]). To most physicists{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}, this merely pushes the problem back, which some see as a fatal [[Occam's razor|unparsimonious]] move in a competition with [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|other theories]].

Recently, it has been argued that the results of [[delayed-choice quantum eraser]] experiments preclude this interpretation.&lt;ref name=Yu_and_Nikolic&gt;{{cite journal | author = Yu S., Nikolić D. | year = 2011 | title = Quantum mechanics needs no consciousness | url = http://www.danko-nikolic.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Yu-and-Nikolic-Qm-and-consciousness-Annalen-Physik.pdf | journal = Annalen der Physik | volume = 523 | issue = 11| pages = 931–938 | doi = 10.1002/andp.201100078|bibcode = 2011AnP...523..931Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the experiment has also been used to argue for support of this interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4834&lt;/ref&gt;  Other researchers have expressed similar objections to the introduction of any subjective element in the collapse of the wavefunction.&lt;ref name=Mandel&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mandel L. | year = 1999 | title = Quantum effects in one-photon and two-photon interference | journal = Rev.

== Reception ==

A poll was conducted at a quantum mechanics conference in 2011 using 33 participants (including physicists, mathematicians, and philosophers). Researchers found that 6% of participants (2 of the 33) indicated that they believed the observer "plays a distinguished physical role (e.g., wave-function collapse by consciousness)". This poll also states that 55% (18 of the 33) indicated that they believed the observer "plays a fundamental role in the application of the formalism but plays no distinguished physical role". They also mention that "Popular accounts have sometimes suggested that the Copenhagen interpretation attributes such a role to consciousness. In our view, this is to misunderstand the Copenhagen interpretation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M. Schlosshauer |author2=J. Koer |author3=A.

=== Views of the pioneers of quantum mechanics ===

Many of the originators of quantum mechanical theory held that humans can effectively interrogate nature through interacting with it, and that in this regard quantum mechanics is not different from [[classical mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Wiley| last = Bohr| first = Niels| title = Atomic Physics and Human Knowledge| year = 1958}}, pp. 73, 81: "The freedom of experimentation, presupposed in classical physics, is of course retained and corresponds to the free choice of experimental arrangement for which the mathematical structure of the quantum mechanical formalism offers the appropriate latitude.  ...  In the great drama of existence we ourselves are both actors and spectators.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Harper &amp; Row| last = Heisenberg| first = Werner| title = Physics and Philosophy| year = 1958}}, p. 32: "[T]he measuring device has been constructed by the observer, and we have to remember that what we observe is not nature in itself but nature exposed to our method of questioning."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal= Dialectica |author=Wolfgang Pauli| title= Naturwissenschaftliche und erkenntnistheoretische Aspekte der Ideen vom Unbewussten| volume=8| pages=283–301| year= 1954| doi=10.1111/j.1746-8361.1954.tb01265.x}} as translated in Harald Atmanspacher and Hans Primas, ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 13(3), 5-50 (2006):  "Pauli’s ideas on mind and matter in the context of contemporary science": “Once the physical observer has chosen his experimental arrangement, he has no further influence on the result which is objectively registered and generally accessible. Subjective properties of the observer or his psychological state are as irrelevant in the quantum mechanical laws of nature as in classical physics.”&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Werner Heisenberg maintained that [[wave function collapse]], "The discontinuous change in the probability function", takes place when the result of a measurement is registered in the mind of an observer. However, this is because he understood the probability function as an artifact of human knowledge: he also argued that the reality of the material transition from "possible" to "actual" was mind-independent. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Harper &amp; Row| last = Heisenberg| first = Werner| title = Physics and Philosophy| year = 1958}}, p. 28. ("The transition from the 'possible' to the 'actual' takes place  as soon as the interaction of the object with the measuring device, and thereby the rest of the world, has come into play; it is not connected with the act of registration of the result by the mind of the observer.   The discontinuous change in the probability function, however, takes place with the act of registration, because it is the discontinuous change of our knowledge in the instant of registration that has its image in the discontinuous change of the probability function.")&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Albert Einstein]], who believed in [[philosophical realism|realism]], and did not accept the theoretical completeness of quantum mechanics, similarly appealed for the merely epistemic conception of the wave function:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“[I advocate] that one conceives of the psi-function [i.e., wavefunction] only as an incomplete description of a real state of affairs, where the incompleteness of the description is forced by the fact that observation of the state is only able to grasp part of the real factual situation. Then one can at least escape the singular conception that observation (conceived as an act of consciousness) influences the real physical state of things; the change in the psi-function through observation then does not correspond essentially to the change in a real matter of fact but rather to the alteration in ''our knowledge'' of this matter of fact.”&lt;ref&gt;A. Einstein to W. Heitler, 1948, translated in A. Fine, ''Einstein’s Interpretations of Quantum Theory'' p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Heisenberg and Bohr described quantum mechanics in [[logical positivism|logical positivist]] terms. Bohr also took an active interest in the philosophical implications of quantum theories such as his [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]], for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Zygon: Journal of Religion &amp; Science |author=John Honner |title= Niels Bohr and the Mysticism of Nature |volume=17-3 |pages=243–253 |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed quantum theory offers a complete description of nature, albeit one that is simply ill-suited for everyday experiences - which are better described by classical mechanics and probability. Bohr never specified a demarcation line above which objects cease to be quantum and become classical. He believed that it was not a question of physics, but one of philosophy or convenience.&lt;ref name="Bohr1928"&gt;{{cite journal| journal= Nature |author=Niels Bohr| title= The Quantum Postulate and the Recent Development of Atomic Theory| volume=121 |pages=580–590| year= 1928 |url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v121/n3050/abs/121580a0.html | doi=10.1038/121580a0|bibcode = 1928Natur.121..580B }} ": "[T]he quantum postulate implies that any observation of atomic phenomena will involve an interaction with the agency of observation not to be neglected. Accordingly, an independent reality in the ordinary physical sense can neither be ascribed to the phenomena nor to the agencies of observation.  After all, the concept of observation is in so far arbitrary as it depends upon which objects are included in the system to be observed.  Ultimately, every observation can, of course, be reduced to our sense perceptions.  The circumstance, however, that in interpreting observations use has always to be made of theoretical notions entails that for every particular case it is a question of convenience at which point the concept of observation involving the quantum postulate with its inherent "irrationality" is brought in."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ernst Haeckel 2.jpg|thumb|170px|right| [[Ernst Haeckel]] wrote about the ''World Riddle'' in 1895]]

The term "'''world riddle'''" or "'''world-riddle'''" has been associated, for over 100 years, with [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (who mentioned ''Welträthsel'' in several of his writings)
and with the [[biologist]]-[[philosopher]] [[Ernst Haeckel]], who, as a [[professor]] of [[zoology]] at the [[University of Jena]],&lt;ref name=Ha1911&gt;
     "Biography of Ernst Heinrich Haeckel, 1834&amp;ndash;1919" ([[Article (publishing)|article]]),

&lt;/ref&gt;
wrote the book ''Die Welträthsel'' in 1895&amp;ndash;1899, in modern spelling ''Die Welträtsel'' ([[German language|German]] "The World-riddles"), with the English version published under the title ''The Riddle of the Universe'', 1901.&lt;ref name=Ha1911/&gt;

The term "world riddle" concerns the nature of the universe and the [[meaning of life]].

The question and answer of the World Riddle has also been examined as an inspiration or [[allegory|allegorical meaning]] within some musical compositions, such as the unresolved harmonic progression at the end of ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Also sprach Zarathustra]]'' (1896) by [[composer]] [[Richard Strauss]], made famous in the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

== View of Nietzsche ==
[[Image:FWNietzscheSiebe.jpg|thumb|120px|right| [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].]]

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] referred to the "World Riddle" (''Welträthsel'') in several of his writings; however, his direct influence was limited to a few years, by his failing health.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

== View of Haeckel ==
[[Ernst Haeckel]] viewed the World Riddle as a dual-question of the form, "What is the nature of the physical universe and what is the nature of human thinking?" which he explained would have a single answer since humans and the universe were contained within one system, a mono-system, as Haeckel wrote in 1895:

&lt;/ref&gt;
:: [From ''Monism as Connecting Religion and Science'' by Ernst Haeckel (translated):]
:: "The following lecture on [[Monism]] is an informal address delivered extemporaneously on October 9, 1892, at Altenburg, on the seventy-fifth anniversary of the ''"Naturforschende Gesellschaft des Osterlandes."'' ... The "exacting" [[Berlin]] [[physiologist]] shut this knowledge out from his mind, and, with a short-sightedness almost inconceivable, placed this special [[neurological]] question alongside of the one great "'''world-riddle'''," the fundamental question of substance, the general question of the connection between matter and energy.  As I long ago pointed out, these two great questions are not two separate "'''world-riddles'''." The neurological problem of [[consciousness]] is only a special case of the all-comprehending [[cosmology|cosmological]] problem, the question of substance. "If we understood the nature of matter and energy, we should also understand how the substance underlying them can under certain conditions feel, desire, and think." Consciousness, like feeling and willing, among the higher animals is a mechanical work of the [[ganglion|ganglion-cells]], and as such must be carried back to chemical and physical events in the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] of these.  -Ernst Haeckel, 1895 &lt;ref name=PGmono/&gt;

Haeckel had written that human behavior and feeling could be explained, within the laws of the physical universe, as "mechanical work of the ganglion-cells" as stated.

== View of William James ==
The [[philosopher]] [[William James]] in his book ''[[Pragmatism]]'' (1907) wrote about the world-riddle, as follows:

:: [From ''Pragmatism'' (Lecture VII) by William James:]
:: "All the great single-word answers to the world's riddle, such as God, the One, Reason, Law, Spirit, Matter, Nature, Polarity, the [[Dialectic]] Process, the Idea, the Self, the Oversoul, draw the admiration that men have lavished on them from this oracular role. By amateurs in philosophy and professionals alike, the universe is represented as a queer sort of petrified sphinx whose appeal to man consists in a monotonous challenge to his divining powers. THE Truth: what a perfect idol of the rationalistic mind!"
:::::::::::: --William James, ''Pragmatism'', 1907.&lt;ref name=GutenWJ&gt;
     "The Project Gutenberg EBook of Pragmatism, by William James" (text),
     Project Gutenberg, 2002, Gutenberg.org webpage:
     [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/prgmt10.txt Gutenberg-Pragmatism].
&lt;/ref&gt;

William James has questioned the attitude of thinking that a single answer applies to everything or everyone.  In the passage, the capitalized "THE" signifies the viewpoint meaning "the one and only" [[absolute truth]].

== Emil du Bois-Reymond ==
[[Emil du Bois-Reymond]] used the term "World Riddle" in 1880 for [[Emil_du_Bois-Reymond#The_Seven_World_Riddles|seven great questions]] of science, such as the ultimate nature of matter and the origin of simple sensations. In the lecture to the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy of Sciences]] he declared that neither science nor philosophy could ever explain these riddles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Emil du Bois-Reymond: Neuroscience, Self, and Society in Nineteenth-Century Germany|last=Finkelstein|first=Gabriel Ward|date=2013|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=9780262019507|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/berdiegrenzende07reygoog]
