      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4954">The '''alphabet of human thought''' is a concept originally proposed by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] that provides a universal way to represent and analyze ideas and relationships by breaking down their component pieces. All ideas are compounded from a very small number of simple ideas which can be represented by a unique character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|series=International Cognitive Linguistics Conference (1 : 1989 : Duisburg) |editor-last=Geiger |editor-first=Richard A. |editor2-first= Brygida |editor2-last=Rudzka-Ostyn|title=Conceptualizations and mental processing in language|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=1993|pages=25–26|isbn=978-3-11-012714-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bunnin|first=Nicholas|author2=Jiyuan Yu|title=The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=2004|pages=715|isbn=978-1-4051-0679-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logic and the Universal Language ==
Logic was Leibniz's earliest philosophic interest going back to his teens. [[René Descartes]] had suggested that the [[lexicon]] of a [[universal language]] should consist of primitive elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hatfield|first1=Gary|title=René Descartes, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2014 Edition)|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2014/entries/descartes/|website=plato.stanford.edu|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=12 July 2014|quote=he offered a new vision of the natural world that continues to shape our thought today: a world of matter possessing a few fundamental properties and interacting according to a few universal laws.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The systematic combination of these elements, according to syntactical rules, would generate the infinite combinations of computational structures required to represent human language. In this way Descartes and Leibniz were precursors to computational linguistics as defined by [[Noam Chomsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chomsky|first1=Noam|title=New Horizons in the Study of Language and Mind|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521658225|pages=425–428|edition=Kindle|quote=I mentioned that modern generative grammar has sought to address concerns that animated the tradition; in particular, the Cartesian idea that "the true distinction" (Descartes 1649/1927: 360) between humans and other creatures or machines is the ability to act in the manner they took to be most clearly illustrated in the ordinary use of language: without any finite limits, influenced but not determined by internal state, appropriate to situations but not caused by them, coherent and evoking thoughts that the hearer might have expressed, and so on. The goal of the work I have been discussing is to unearth some of the factors that enter into such normal practice.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 18th century, Leibniz outlined his ''[[characteristica universalis]]'', an artificial language in which [[grammar|grammatical]] and [[logic]]al structure would coincide, which would allow  reasoning to be reduced to calculation. Leibniz acknowledged the work of [[Ramon Llull]], particularly the ''Ars generalis ultima'' (1305), as one of the inspirations for this idea. The basic elements of his ''characteristica'' would be pictographic characters representing unambiguously a limited number of elementary concepts. Leibniz called the inventory of these concepts "the alphabet of human thought." There are quite a few mentions of the ''characteristica'' in Leibniz's writings, but he never set out any details save for a brief outline of some possible sentences in his ''Dissertation on the Art of Combinations''.

His main interest was what is known in modern logic as classification and composition. In modern terminology Leibniz's alphabet was a proposal for an [[automated theorem prover]] or [[Hierarchical classifier|ontology classification reasoner]] written centuries before the technology to implement them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=L.J.|title= The Encyclopedia of Philosophy Volumes 3 and 4|year=1985|publisher=Macmillan Publishing|asin=B0017IMQME|pages=422–423 |editor=Paul Edwards|chapter=Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm|quote=his main emphasis... was on classification, deduction was a natural consequence of combining classified items into new classes.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Semantic web implementation ==
[[John Giannandrea]], co-founder and CTO of [[Metaweb|Metaweb Technologies]], acknowledged in a speech that [[Freebase]] was at least linked to the alphabet of human thought, if not an implementation of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = PARCForum Presentation by Giannandrea, J.|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa__x-wUKWw|website = YouTube|accessdate = 2015-10-30|at = min 37+}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In philosophy, '''animalism''' is a theory according to which humans are animals.&lt;ref&gt;Eric T. Olson (2007) ''What are we?: a study in personal ontology'', Oxford University Press, section 2.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of animalism is advocated by philosophers [[Eric T. Olson (philosopher)|Eric T. Olson]], Paul Snowdon, Stephan Blatti, and [[David Wiggins]].&lt;ref name=garrett&gt; Brian Garrett, ''Personal Identity and Self-Consciousness''.

'''Armchair theorizing''', '''armchair philosophizing''', or '''armchair scholarship''' is an approach to providing new developments in a field that does not involve the collection of new information but, rather, a careful analysis or synthesis of existent scholarship, especially frivolously or superficially so.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{Harvcoltxt|Nadel|1956|p=173}}, who defines ''armchair anthropology''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Commentary and analysis ==
Different disciplines place different weight on purely theoretical research. Some [[anthropology|anthropologists]] argue that purely theoretical anthropological research is outdated and that [[ethnography|ethnographic fieldwork]] should be a necessary part of anthropological research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ingold|2007|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some commentators argue that [[economic theory|economic theories]] are designed to explain and predict economic phenomena, which requires analysis and synthesis, and not necessarily collection, of data.  [[Leland B. Yeager]] even argues that economists can legitimately extrapolate from their own personal observations to design new theories.  In this sense, Yeager sees armchair theorizing as something better than the "mere sterile juggling of arbitrary assumptions" saying that "it can have a sound empirical basis."&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0254/is_5_60/ai_82469376/pg_9 Henry George and Austrian economics - History of Thought], ''[[The American Journal of Economics and Sociology]]'', Dec, 2001  by [[Leland B. Yeager]]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
While armchair scholarship contrasts with the [[scientific method]], which inherently involves the active investigation of the nature through data collection, armchair philosophers and theorizers can assist in formulating theories that explain observations; these theories can then be tested with further scientific investigation. While the methods of the armchair philosopher are different from those of the scientist, they can complement each other to produce new insights and discover necessary truths, whether they are empirical or theoretical.

'''Artificial philosophy''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] branch conceived by author Louis Molnar&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267156955_A_Step_Beyond_AI_Artificial_Philosophy "article: Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications", ResearchGate, (retrieved November 25, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; to consider what a being bestowed with [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) might consider about its own [[existence]] once it reaches a higher state of [[consciousness]]. The author reasons in his dissertation that at some point, either through [[Computer_programming|programming]] or organic [[self-development]], [[robot]]s will not see themselves as extensions of those that created them, and that their saying "Who am I?" will not lead them to think of themselves as one with [[human]]s.

'''Associationism''' is the idea that mental processes operate by the [[Association (psychology)|association]] of one mental state with its successor states.

==History==

The idea is first recorded in [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], especially with regard to the succession of memories. Members of the principally British "''Associationist School''", including [[John Locke]], [[David Hume]], [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]], [[Joseph Priestley]], [[James Mill]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Alexander Bain]], and [[Ivan Pavlov]], asserted that the principle applied to all or most mental processes.&lt;ref name="Boring"&gt;Boring, E. G. (1950) "A History of Experimental Psychology" New York, Appleton-Century-Crofts&lt;/ref&gt; Later members of the school developed very specific principles elaborating how associations worked and even a physiological mechanism bearing no resemblance to modern [[neurophysiology]].&lt;ref&gt;Pavlov, I.P. (1927, 1960) "Conditioned Reflexes" New York, Oxford (1927) Dover (1960)&lt;/ref&gt;  For a fuller explanation of the intellectual history of associationism and the "Associationist School", see ''[[Association of Ideas]]''.

Some of the ideas of the Associationist School anticipated the principles of [[Classical conditioning|conditioning]] and its use in [[behaviourism|behavioral psychology]].&lt;ref name="Boring"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3608">'''Bracketing''' ({{lang-de|Einklammerung}}; also called '''phenomenological reduction''') is a term in the philosophical movement of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] describing the act of suspending judgment about the natural world to instead focus on analysis of experience.

==Overview==
Phenomenology, developed by [[Edmund Husserl]] (1859–1938), can be understood as an outgrowth of the influential ideas of [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724-1804). Attempting to resolve some of the key intellectual debates of his era, Kant argued that ''[[Noumenon|Noumena]]'' (fundamentally unknowable things-in-themselves) must be distinguished from ''[[Phenomenon|Phenomena]]'' (the world as it appears to the mind). Kant, commonly misconceived as arguing that humans cannot have direct access to [[Reality#Western philosophy|reality]], but only to the [[Mental content|contents of their minds]], argued rather that what is experienced in the mind is reality. Phenomenology grew out of this conception of phenomena, and studies the meaning of isolated phenomena as directly connected to our minds. According to The Columbia Encyclopedia, "Modern philosophers have used 'phenomenon' to designate what is apprehended before judgment is applied."&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/columency/phenomenon |title=Phenomenon |publisher=The Columbia Encyclopedia |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may not be possible if observation is [[theory-ladenness|theory laden]].

Bracketing (or ''epoché'') is a preliminary act in the phenomenological analysis, conceived by Husserl as the suspension of the trust in the objectivity of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Farina, Gabriella (2014). [http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A14-07.pdf Some reflections on the phenomenological method.] ''Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences'', '''7'''(2):50–62.&lt;/ref&gt; It involves setting aside the question of the real existence of a contemplated object, as well as all other questions about the object's physical or objective nature; these questions are left to the [[natural sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/851394087|title=Cartesian Meditations: An Introduction to Phenomenology|last=Husserl|first=Edmund|date=|publisher=Springer Netherlands|year=1977|isbn=9789400999978|location=Dordrecht|pages=20-21|oclc=851394087}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the act of seeing a horse qualifies as an experience, whether one sees the horse in person, in a dream, or in a hallucination. 'Bracketing' the horse suspends any judgement about the horse as ''noumenon'', and instead analyses the ''phenomenon'' of the horse as constituted in intentional acts.

Bracketing may also be understood in terms of the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] activity it is supposed to make possible:  the "unpacking" of phenomena, or, in other words, systematically peeling away their symbolic meanings like layers of an onion until only the thing itself as meant and experienced remains. Thus, one's subjective intending of the bracketed phenomenon is examined and analyzed in phenomenological purity.

'''Bradley's Regress''' is a philosophical problem concerning the nature of [[Relation (philosophy)|relations]].  It is named after [[F. H. Bradley]] who discussed the problem in his 1893 book ''Appearance and Reality''.  It bears a close kinship to the issue of the [[unity of the proposition]].

== Description==

Bradley raises the problem while discussing the [[bundle theory]] of objects, according to which an [[Object (philosophy)|object]] is merely a "bundle" of [[property|properties]].  This theory raises the question of how the various properties that together comprise an object are related when they in fact comprise an object.  More generally, the question that arises is what has to be the case for any two things to be related. Bradley's Regress appears to show that the notion of two things being related generates an [[infinite regress]].  

Suppose, for example, that ''a'' respects ''b''.  This [[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]] seems to involve three things: ''a'', ''b'', and the relation of respecting.  For the state of affairs of ''a'' respecting ''b'' to obtain, it doesn't, however, suffice that these three things (''a'', ''b'', and the relation of respecting) exist.  They must also be related in some way.  What is required, we might say, is that ''a'' and ''b'' "stand in" the relation of respecting.  But now we seem to have another state of affairs: the state of affairs of ''a'' and ''b'' standing in the relation of respecting.  This state of affairs in turn seems to involve four things: ''a'', ''b'', the relation of respecting, and the relation of standing in.  Again, however, for it to be the case that ''a'' and ''b'' stand in the relation of respecting, it doesn't suffice that these four items exist.  They must also be related in some way.  What is required, we might now say, is that ''a'', ''b'', and the relation of respecting stand in the relation of standing in. And so on, [[ad infinitum]].

== Responses ==

In ''Appearance and Reality'', Bradley seems to conclude that the regress should lead us to abandon the idea that relations are "independently real".  One way to take this suggestion is as recommending that in the case of a respecting b, we are dealing with a state of affairs that has only two constituents: a and b.  It does not, in addition, involve a third item, "the relation of respecting", to which a and b must then bear some further relation ("standing in").

A different option is to accept that the regress is real, but to deny that it is a [[infinite regress|vicious regress]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9804">[[File:Buridan's bridge.jpg|One proposed humorous solution for the Buridan's bridge sophism is to let Socrates cross the bridge and then throw him into the water on the other side.|300px|thumb]] 
'''Buridan's Bridge''' (also known as '''[[Sophism]] 17''') is described by [[Jean Buridan]], one of the most famous and influential [[Philosophy|philosophers]] of the [[Late Middle Ages]], in his book ''Sophismata''. It is a [[self-referential]] [[paradox]] that involves a [[proposition]] pronounced about an event that might or might not happen in the future.

==The sophism==

The sophism is:
{{quotation|Imagine the following scenario:&lt;br&gt;
Socrates wants to cross a river and comes to a bridge guarded by Plato. The two speak as follows:&lt;br&gt;
''Plato:'' "Socrates, if in the first proposition which you utter, you speak the
truth, I will permit you to cross. But surely, if you speak falsely, I shall throw you into the water."&lt;br&gt;
''Socrates:'' "You will throw me into the water."&lt;ref name="Tense"/&gt;}}

[[Socrates]]' response puts [[Plato]] in a difficult situation. He could not throw Socrates into the water, because if he did he would violate his promise to let Socrates cross the bridge if he speaks the truth. On the other hand, if Plato allows Socrates to cross the bridge it would mean that Socrates spoke untruth when he replied: "You are going to throw me into the water." In that case Socrates should have been thrown into the water. In other words, Socrates could be allowed to cross the bridge if and only if he could not be.&lt;ref name="Buridan's Bridge"/&gt;

==Buridan's solution==

In order to solve the paradox Buridan proposes three questions:
#Is the proposition uttered by Socrates: "You are going to throw me into the water" true, or is it false?
#Is Plato's promise true or is it false?
#"What ought Plato to do to fulfill his promise?"&lt;ref name="Ulatowski"/&gt;

In response to the first question Buridan states that it is impossible to determine if Socrates' proposition is true or false. This is because the proposition "You are going to throw me into the water" is a [[Problem of future contingents|future contingent]] that could be true or false depending on what Plato is going to do. Dr. Joseph W. Ulatowski says that Buridan apparently used [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] thesis about what "truth" is to come up with this response. Aristotle believed that a proposition is true if and only if it is verified by the state of things as they currently are. Contradicting the [[principle of bivalence]], Buridan implies a system of  [[three-valued logic]] in which there are three [[truth value]]s--''true'', ''false'', and some indeterminate third value.&lt;ref name="Ulatowski"/&gt;

In determining the truth value of Plato's conditional promise, Buridan suggests that Plato's promise was false, and that because Plato gave his promise carelessly he is not obligated to fulfill the promise.&lt;ref name="Ulatowski"/&gt;

In discussing the third question, "What ought Plato to do to fulfill his promise", Buridan states that Plato should not have given a conditional promise in the first place. He also suggests that Plato could have made sure that the condition was formulated in such a way that it would not cause a contradiction; because Plato cannot fulfill his conditional promise without violating it, he is not obligated to fulfill the promise. Ulatowski points out that this interpretation is the [[contrapositive]] of a principle of [[Immanuel Kant]]: "ought implies can".&lt;ref name="Ulatowski"/&gt;

==Philosophers on the sophism and its solution==

In his solution to the sophism, [[Walter Burley]] (d. 1344/1345) applied the principle "nothing is true unless at this instant" (''"nihil est verum nisi in hoc instanti"'') and concluded that "if a proposition is true it must be true now".&lt;ref name="truth now"/&gt;

Dr. Dale Jacquette of the [[University of Bern]] says that "Plato can either permit Socrates to pass or have him seized and thrown into the river without violating his conditional vow". Jacquette argues that Plato's conditional promise was given only in regard to Socrates's proposition being clearly and unconditionally either true or false. To prove his point Jacquette asks, what would Plato have to do if Socrates had said nothing and was "as silent as a [[Sphinx]]", or if he uttered something that could not be either proven or "undisproven", something like [[Goldbach's conjecture]]. Jacquette concludes that Plato's conditional promise was true, and Socrates's proposition is "neither true ''simpliciter'' nor false ''simpliciter''", and therefore Plato would be right regardless of the choice that he made.&lt;ref name="Ulatowski"/&gt;

In his book ''Paradoxes from A to Z'' Professor Michael Clark comes to the conclusion that if Plato is an honorable man, Socrates should not get wet under any circumstances. Clark argues that Socrates could say, "Either I am speaking falsely, and you will throw me in, or I am speaking truly, and you won't throw me in". Clark says that if this sentence is true, then it means that the first alternative "is ruled out", leaving us only with the second one. If this sentence is false, it means that both alternatives are false, and because Socrates spoke falsely "it will be false" to throw him into the river.&lt;ref name="Paradoxes from A to Z"/&gt;  

Dr. Joseph W. Ulatowski believes that since the truth value in Plato's conditional promise and even more so in Socrates's proposition is indeterminate, it means that Plato "ought to err on the side of caution with respect to the future contingency and allow Socrates to cross the bridge".&lt;ref name="Ulatowski"/&gt; In the same work Ulatowski offers a couple of humorous solutions to the paradox. Plato, Ulatowski says, could let Socrates to cross the bridge, and then throw him into water on the other side. Or both Plato and Socrates could combine their efforts and forcibly eject Buridan himself from Buridan's bridge.&lt;ref name="Ulatowski"/&gt;

==In ''Don Quixote''==

Buridan's bridge sophism was used by [[Miguel de Cervantes]] in ''[[Don Quixote]]'',&lt;ref name="Paradoxes from A to Z"/&gt; when [[Sancho Panza|Sancho]] was presented with the Buridan's bridge dilemma: A man who was going to cross the bridge was asked to respond truthfully where he was going or otherwise to face a death by hanging. The man "swore and said that by the oath he took he was going to die upon that gallows that stood there, and nothing else."&lt;ref name="Don Quixote"/&gt;

Sancho summarizes the situation by saying: "the man swears that he is going to die upon the gallows; but if he dies upon it, he has sworn the truth, and by the law enacted deserves to go free and pass over the bridge; but if they don't hang him, then he has sworn falsely, and by the same law deserves to be hanged". He then comes up with the solution, "that of this man they should let pass the part that has sworn truly, and hang the part that has lied; and in this way the conditions of the passage will be fully complied with".&lt;ref name="Don Quixote"/&gt; After Sancho makes this statement, the person who was asking for advice reasons with him:{{quotation|"But then, senor governor," replied the querist, "the man will have to be divided into two parts; and if he is divided of course he will die; and so none of the requirements of the law will be carried out, and it is absolutely necessary to comply with it."&lt;ref name="Don Quixote"/&gt;}} Sancho comes up with the moral solution:{{quotation|...there is the same reason for this passenger dying as for his living and passing over the bridge; for if the truth saves him the falsehood equally condemns him; and that being the case it is my opinion you should say to the gentlemen who sent you to me that as the arguments for condemning him and for absolving him are exactly balanced, they should let him pass freely, as it is always more praiseworthy to do good than to do evil.&lt;ref name="Don Quixote"/&gt;}}

The  '''''Calculus ratiocinator''''' is a theoretical universal logical calculation framework, a concept described in the writings of [[Gottfried Leibniz]], usually paired with his more frequently mentioned ''[[characteristica universalis]]'', a universal conceptual language.

==Two views==
There are two contrasting points of view on what Leibniz meant by ''calculus ratiocinator''. The first is associated with [[computer software]], the second is associated with [[computer hardware]].

=== The analytic view ===
*The received point of view in [[analytic philosophy]] and formal [[logic]], is that the ''calculus ratiocinator'' anticipates [[mathematical logic]]&amp;mdash;an "algebra of logic".&lt;ref&gt;Fearnley-Sander 1982: p.164&lt;/ref&gt; The analytic point of view understands that the ''calculus ratiocinator'' is a formal [[inference engine]]&lt;!--what makes an inference engine formal or informal--&gt; or [[computer program]], which can be designed so as to grant primacy to calculations. That logic began with [[Frege]]'s 1879 ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' and [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C.S. Peirce]]'s writings on logic in the 1880s. [[Frege]] intended his "concept script" to be a ''calculus ratiocinator'' as well as a ''[[lingua characteristica]]''. That part of formal logic relevant to the calculus comes under the heading of [[proof theory]]. From this perspective the ''calculus ratiocinator'' is only a part (or a subset) of the ''[[universal characteristic]]'', and a complete ''universal characteristic'' includes a "logical calculus".

=== The synthetic view ===
*A contrasting point of view stems from [[Herbert Spencer#Synthetic philosophy|synthetic philosophy]] and fields such as [[cybernetics]], [[electronic engineering]] and [[general systems theory]]. It is little appreciated in analytic philosophy. The synthetic view understands the ''calculus ratiocinator'' as referring to a "calculating machine". The cybernetician [[Norbert Wiener]] considered Leibniz's ''calculus ratiocinator'' a forerunner to the modern day digital computer:

{{cquote|The history of the modern computing machine goes back to Leibniz and Pascal. Indeed, the general idea of a computing machine is nothing but a mechanization of Leibniz's ''calculus ratiocinator''. (Wiener 1948: 214)}}

{{cquote|...like his predecessor Pascal, [Leibniz] was interested in the construction of computing machines in the Metal. ... just as the [[calculus of arithmetic]] lends itself to a mechanization progressing through the abacus and the desk computing machine to the utra-rapid computing machines of the present day, so the ''calculus ratiocinator'' of Leibniz contains the germs of the ''[[machina ratiocinatrix]]'', the reasoning machine (Wiener 1965: 12)}}

Leibniz constructed just such a machine for mathematical calculations, which was also called a [[Stepped Reckoner]]. As a computing machine, the ideal ''calculus ratiocinator'' would perform Leibniz's integral and differential calculus. In this way the meaning of the word, "ratiocinator" is clarified and can be understood as a mechanical instrument that combines and compares ratios.
&lt;gallery class="center"&gt;

File:Leibnitzrechenmaschine.jpg
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Hartley Rogers saw a link between the two, defining the ''calculus ratiocinator'' as "an algorithm which, when applied to the symbols of any formula of the characteristica universalis, would determine whether or not that formula were true as a statement of science" (Hartley Rogers, Jr. 1963; p.&amp;nbsp;934).

A classic discussion of the ''calculus ratiocinator'' is Couturat (1901: chapters 3 and 4), who maintained that the ''characteristica universalis''—and thus the ''calculus ratiocinator''—were inseparable from Leibniz's encyclopedic project (chapter 5). Hence the ''characteristic'', ''calculus ratiocinator'', and encyclopedia form three pillars of Leibniz's project.

In philosophy, the '''Cartesian Self''', part of a [[thought experiment]], is an individual's mind, separate from the body and the outside world, thinking about itself and its existence. It is distinguished from the [[Cartesian Other]], anything other than the Cartesian self. According to the philosopher [[Descartes]], there is a divide intrinsic to [[consciousness]], such that one cannot ever bridge the space between one's own consciousness and that of another.

Descartes concluded famously that [[Cogito ergo sum]], "I think, therefore I am", but realized that according to his [[wax argument]] you could never similarly demonstrate the existence of the 'other'.  However, the Cartesian Self, he concluded, is thus almost entirely [[Self-evidence|self-evident]]: the existence of some being ''asking'' about itself necessarily implied that such a being existed.  Because of this, while humans can know everything of the self and its mysteries, we cannot actually know anything of anything that is not the self.

It is based on the whole of the Cartesian Pure Inquirer, where cognitive capabilities and methods of achieving knowledge are alike to all knowers. However, the "knower" (particularly to Descartes) is treated as a featureless abstract, and not an actual person.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3641">'''Chemism''' refers to forces of attraction or adhesion between entities.  It has uses in chemistry and philosophy.

==Chemistry==
In the past, chemism referred to intramolecular forces between atoms, or more generally, any forces acting on atoms and molecules.&lt;ref&gt;''The principles of theoretical chemistry, with special reference to the constitution of chemical compounds'' (1887).  Remsen, Ira,, Philadelphia, Lea Brothers &amp; Co. pg, 83 (archived version [https://archive.org/details/cu31924002984676 here])&lt;/ref&gt;  It is now typically superseded by more precise terms such as [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen interaction]].

==Philosophy==
The concept of chemism has been referred to in many of the various disciplines that constitute philosophical practice. Some of the include:

*The use of the term in philosophy references the activities of chemism in chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Clark.  ''Hegel's logic: between dialectic and history'', Northwestern University Press, Chicago. 1996. (p. 260)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Chemism is a term in [[Hegelianism|Hegelian philosophy]] that stands for the ''"mutual attraction, interpenetration, and neutralisation of independent individuals which unite to form a whole."'' Hegel posits that the concept of "Objectivity" contains the "three forms of Mechanism, Chemism , and Teleology":

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"The object of mechanical type is the immediate and undifferentiated object. No doubt it contains difference, but the different pieces stand, as it were, without affinity to each other, and their connection is only extraneous. In chemism, on the contrary, the object exhibits an essential tendency to differentiation, in such a way that the objects are what they are only by their relation to each other: this tendency to difference constitutes their quality. The third type of objectivity, the teleological relation, is the unity of mechanism and chemism. Design, like the mechanical object, is a self-contained totality, enriched however by the principle of differentiation which came to the fore in chemism, and thus referring itself to the object that stands over against it. Finally, it is the realisation of design which forms the transition to the Idea."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kern-ep.de/Internet/Hegels_Logik/object.htm|title=Hegel, The Notion, Part B. The Object|first=|last=Hegel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*In his ''Science of Logic'', [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]  develops a succession of different forms of mechanism, which end up engendering a process called "chemism". Chemism is obviously a term that lends itself to chemical relationships in physical reality. Hegel, however, is using the term "chemism" logically, and therefore it can be applied to things that you do not study in chemistry class but you might study in German literature, reading Goethe's ''Elective Affinities,'' or in psychological studies dealing with a chemistry between individuals:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Chemism constitutes in objectivity as a whole, the moment of judgment, of the difference that has become objective, and of the process. Since it already begins with determinateness and positedness and the chemical object is at the same time an objective totality, its immediate course is simple and is completely determined by its presupposition."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''co-premise''' is a [[premise]] in [[reasoning]] and [[informal logic]] which is not the main supporting reason for a [[main contention|contention]] or a [[Lemma (logic)|lemma]], but is logically necessary to ensure the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of an [[argument]]. One premise by itself, or a group of co-premises can form a reason. 

== Logical structure ==

Every significant term or phrase appearing in a premise of a [[simple argument]], should also appear in the contention/conclusion or in a co-premise. But this by itself does not guarantee a valid argument, see the [[fallacy of the undistributed middle]] for an example of this.

Sometimes a co-premise will not be explicitly stated. This type of argument is known as an 'enthymematic' argument, and the co-premise may be referred to as a 'hidden' or an 'unstated' co-premise and will often be subject to an [[inference objection]]. In this [[argument map]] of a simple argument the two reasons for the main contention are co-premises and not separate reasons for believing the contention to be true. They are both necessary to ensure that the argument as a whole retains logical validity.

In this example, "What the Bible says is true" is a hidden co-premise.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3524">The balance of '''Competing goods''' is a philosophical problem involving the acknowledgement of multiple social values that may at times conflict with one another.

The 20th-century philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]] invokes [[Aristotle]] in her discussions of the problem, writing that "[T]he Aristotelian agent scrutinizes each valuable alternative, seeking out its distinct nature. She is determined to acknowledge the precise sort of value or goodness present in each of competing alternatives, seeing each value, so to speak, as a separate jewel in the crown, valuable in its own right, which does not cease to be separately valuable just because the contingencies of the situation sever it from other goods and it loses out in an overall rational choice.";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The failure of corporate law: fundamental flaws and progressive possibilities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bEKqN8QMONsC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=The+failure+of+corporate+law:+fundamental+flaws+and+progressive+possibilities+competing+goods+nussbaum&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=2006|page=226|ISBN=978-0-226-30693-3|author=Kent Greenfield}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that Aristotle saw that "the values that are constitutive of a good human life are plural and incommensurable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sourcebook on rhetoric: key concepts in contemporary rhetorical studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z4C-maGgYk0C&amp;pg=PA465&amp;dq=Competing+goods+nussbaum+aristotle&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=03wSTPeXAcWonAevtvWRAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=|author=James Jasinski|publisher=[[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]|ISBN=978-0-7619-0504-2|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nussbaum has argued that [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] were mistaken when they dismissed conflicts of obligation as illogical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Leading lives that matter: what we should do and who we should be|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lqEMy6RbF4sC&amp;pg=PA310&amp;dq=%22competing+goods%22+nussbaum&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22competing%20goods%22%20nussbaum&amp;f=false|year=2006|author=Mark R.

'''Condition of possibility''' (''Bedingungen der Möglichkeit'') is a [[philosophic]]al [[concept]] made popular by [[Immanuel Kant]].

A condition of possibility is a necessary framework for the possible appearance of a given list of entities. It is often used in contrast to the unilateral [[causality]] concept, or even to the notion of [[interaction]]. For example, consider a cube made by an artisan. All cubes are three-dimensional. If an object is three-dimensional, then it is an extended object. But extension is an impossibility without space. Therefore, space is a condition of possibility because it is a necessary condition for the existence of cubes to be possible. Note, however, that [[space]] did not cause the cube, but that the artisan did, and that the cube and space are distinct entities, so space isn’t part of the definition of cube.

{{cns|text=[[Gilles Deleuze]] presented it as a dichotomy in contradistinction to the classical [[phenomenon]]/[[noumenon]] dichotomy.|date=March 2016}} From [[Plato]] to [[Descartes]], what was presented by the senses was deemed illusory and {{clarify|text=denigrated|date=March 2016}}. It was believed that the perceptions ought to be overcome to grasp the [[thing-in-itself]], the essential essence, also known as Plato’s [[allegory of the cave]]. With Kant comes a transition in philosophy from this dichotomy to the dichotomy of the {{cfy|reason=technical term?|text=apparition|date=March 2016}}/{{cfy|reason=technical term?|text=conditions-of-appearance|date=March 2016}}. There is no longer any higher essence behind the {{cfy|reason=technical term?|text=apparition|date=March 2016}}. It is what it is, a brute fact, and what one must now examine is the conditions that are necessary for its appearance. Immanuel Kant does just this in the [[The Critique of Pure Reason#Transcendental Aesthetic|Transcendental Aesthetic]], when he examines the necessary conditions for the [[analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic]] ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' cognition of [[mathematics]]. But Kant ''was'' {{clarify|text=a transition|reason=unclear; technical term?|date=March 2016}}, so he still maintains the phenomenon/noumenon dichotomy, but the noumenon has already been relegated unknowable and to be ignored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webdeleuze.com/php/texte.php?cle=58&amp;groupe=Kant&amp;langue=1 Deleuze: Kant: 14 March 1978.] (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] would come to adapt it in a [[historical]] sense through the concept of "[[episteme]]":

&lt;blockquote&gt; what I am attempting to bring to light is the epistemological field, the ''épistémè'' in which knowledge, envisaged apart from all criteria having reference to its rational value or to its objective forms, grounds its positivity and thereby manifests a history which is not that of its growing perfection, but rather that of its conditions of possibility; in this account, what should appear are those configurations within the space of knowledge which have given rise to the diverse forms of empirical science. Such an enterprise is not so much a history, in the traditional meaning of that word, as an ‘archaeology’.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Michel | last = Foucault | title = The Order of Things | year = 2002 | page = xxiii-xxiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant defined the relationship between ontotheology and cosmostheology as follows: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Transcendental theology aims either at inferring the existence of a Supreme Being from a general experience, without any closer reference to the world to which this experience belongs, and in this case it is called cosmotheology; or it endeavours to cognize the existence of such a being, through mere conceptions, without the aid of experience, and is then termed ontotheology."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', [https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;q=%22Transcendental+theology+aims+either+at+inferring+the+existence+of+a+Supreme+Being+from+a+general+experience,+without+any+closer+reference+to+the+world+to+which+this+experience+belongs,+and+in+this+case%22%22it+is+called+cosmotheology;+or+it+endeavours+to+cognize+the+existence+of+such+a+being,+through+mere+conceptions,+without+the+aid+of+experience,+and+is+then+termed+Ontotheology%22 Section VII: Critique of all Theology based upon Speculative Principles of Reason].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Critical practice''' is the methodology used by a [[critic]] or observer to understand and evaluate a [[Field of study|field of knowledge]].  While sometimes the fields of knowledge studied are academic, non-academic fields such as merchandising, law enforcement and medical clinical practice have been extensively studied. Critical practice is grounded in the concepts of [[critical theory]]. Consultants employing critical practice skills aim to help people improve outcomes. Analysis is applied to groups working in a particular area of expertise and with identifiable practice skills, and usually to a defined range of problems and situations. Thus, practice tends to be based on a restricted view of people and their problems with a limited range of values applied in that practice.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} 

Critical practice aims to develop the ability and skill to see beyond the usual concerns of any given profession, into its unintended side effects, causes and consequences, and to do so from a critical and evaluative perspective.

Thus, for example, the profession of [[social work]] might be practiced critically through practitioners being conscious that their role may be seen, and could operate, as an agent of [[social control]], rather than just one of promoting some degree of liberation or of empowerment. In such a case the practitioner would be both the observer and the observed.

[[File:Norbert wiener.jpg|thumb|right|Norbert Weiner, the founder of cybernetics.]]
'''Dualism in cybernetics''' refers to systems or problems in which one or more [[intelligent]] adversaries attempt to exploit the weaknesses of the investigator. Examples could include a game-playing opponent, adversarial law, evolutionary systems of predator/parasite and prey/host, or politics/enslavement attempts. [[Norbert Wiener]], the founder of [[cybernetics]], contrasted "[[Manichean]] devils" (dualistic adversarial systems) with "[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] devils"—systems or problems that, though very complex and difficult to figure out, did not feature an adversary with contrary intent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dubberly.com/articles/cybernetics-and-counterculture.html|title=How cybernetics connects computing, counterculture, and design|website=www.dubberly.com|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victories or "expansions of knowledge" in the latter type of system were able to be built upon incrementally, through science (experimentation expanding empirical knowledge bases). Wiener noted that temporary weaknesses (such as errors to perceive all components of a system) were not fatal in attempts to defeat "Augustinian devils" because another experiment could simply be pursued (and he noted that he had personally defeated many "Augustinian devils" with his contributions to science and engineering). By contrast, Wiener observed that temporary lapses in judgment against "Manichean devils" were more often fatal or destructive, due to the desire of the opponent to "win/survive at all costs", even by introducing deception into the system. He said that he had been defeated by many "Manichean devils", such as on occasions when he was temporarily careless in chess.

Although this duality between complexity (in the case of the Augustinian devils) and opposition (in the case of Manichean devils) may seem obvious, it holds deep implications for many areas of science, such as [[game theory]], [[political science]], [[computer science]], [[network science]], [[Security|security science]], [[military science]], [[evolutionary biology]], and [[cryptography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Cont/ContSato.htm|title=20th WCP: The Significance of System Cybernetics for Contemporary Philosophy- Post-Modernity in System Cybernetics|website=www.bu.edu|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3474">'''Equality of autonomy''' is a [[political philosophy]] concept of [[Amartya Sen]] that argues "that the ability and means to choose our life course should be spread as equally as possible across society"—i.e., an equal chance at [[autonomy]] or [[empowerment]].&lt;ref name=twsO23&gt;{{cite news |author= Sunder Katwala |title= It's equality of life chances, not literal equality, that the left espouses |work= [[The Guardian]] |date= 21 October 2010 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/oct/21/equality-life-chances-not-literal-left |accessdate= 2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equality of autonomy strives to spread empowerment widely so that "given their circumstances", people have more "choice and control".&lt;ref name=twsO24&gt;{{cite news|title=Equality Impact Assessments |publisher=''Hull Teaching Primary Care'' |date=2011-07-15 |url=http://www.hullpct.nhs.uk/impact_assessments/ |accessdate=2011-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307214013/http://www.hullpct.nhs.uk/impact_assessments/ |archivedate=2012-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has a slightly different emphasis from related notions, such as the value of [[Inequality in the workplace|equality in the workplace]] ("[[equal opportunity]]") or equal material wealth ("[[equality of outcome]]").

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2354">The '''faculties of the soul''' are the individual characteristics of a [[soul]].  There have been different attempts to define them over the centuries.

==Plato, Aristotle and their followers==

[[Plato]] defined the faculties of the soul in terms of a three-fold division: the intellect (''noûs''), the nobler affections (''thumós''), and the appetites or passions (''epithumetikón'')&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Faculties of the Soul}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Aristotle]] also made a three-fold division of natural faculties, into vegetative, appetitive and rational elements,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Ethics'' (1976) p. 88-90&lt;/ref&gt; though he later distinguished further divisions in the rational faculty, such as the faculty of judgement and that of cleverness (deinotes).&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, p. 218-222&lt;/ref&gt;

Islamic philosophers continued his three-fold division;&lt;ref&gt;S. S. Hawi, ''Islamic Naturalism and Mysticism'' (1974) p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;  but later Scholastic philosophers defined five groups of faculties:&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Faculties of the Soul|Faculties of the Soul]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* dunámeis - the "vegetative" faculty (threptikón), concerned with the maintenance and development of organic life
* the appetite (oretikón), or the tendency to any good
* the faculty of sense perception (aisthetikón)
* the "locomotive" faculty (kinetikón), which presides over the various bodily movements
* reason (dianoetikón)

==Calvin==
[[John Calvin]] opposed the scholastic philosophers, favoring a two-fold division of the soul, consisting of intellect and of will.&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'' (2008) p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

==Faculty psychology==
The secularisation of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] produced a [[faculty psychology]] of different but inherent mental powers such as intelligence or memory, distinct (as in Aristotelianism) from the acquired habits.&lt;ref&gt;R. Gregory, ''The Oxford Companion to the Mind'' (1987) p. 253-4&lt;/ref&gt;

They are traditionally accounted a kind of sainthood and their [[spirit tablets]] are prominently placed in [[Confucian temple]]s, two upon the east and two upon the west side of the Hall of the Great Completion (''Dacheng Dian'').

The Four Sages are:
* [[Yan Hui]], Confucius's favourite [[disciples of Confucius|disciple]]
* [[Zengzi]] or Zeng Shen, another disciple of Confucius and author of the ''[[Great Learning]]''
* [[Zisi]] or Kong Ji, Confucius's grandson, student of Zengzi, and author of the ''[[Doctrine of the Mean]]'' 
* [[Mencius]] or Master Meng, student of Zisi and author of the ''[[Mencius (book)|Mencius]].''

Within a traditional Confucian temple, Yan Hui's tablet is placed first to the east of Confucius.&lt;ref name="Legge"/&gt;

The families of the descendants of the Four Sages [[w:zh:四氏|四氏]] still hold hereditary offices in the Republic of China (Taiwan) such as the [[Sacrificial Official to Confucius]], "Sacrificial Official to [[Mencius]]", "Sacrificial Official to [[Zengzi]]", and "Sacrificial Official to [[Yan Hui]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://news.xinhuanet.com/tw/2009-07/24/content_11764658.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://news.sina.com.cn/o/2009-07-23/101716000328s.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.rfi.fr/actucn/articles/115/article_15023.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.xuite.net/ahhsiang/TYDA/20446373-【文史雜記】大成至聖先師奉祀官&lt;/ref&gt; They use [[Generation_name#Generation_poem|generation poems]] for their names given to them by the Ming and Qing Emperors.&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://www.ndcnc.gov.cn/datalib/2004/HundredName/DL/DL-20031203183333/ 孔姓 (The Kong family, descendents of Confucius)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903010033/http://www.ndcnc.gov.cn/datalib/2004/HundredName/DL/DL-20031203183333/ |date=September 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://www.ndcnc.gov.cn/datalib/2004/HundredName/DL/DL-20040216142301 孟姓 (The Meng family, descendents of Mencius)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116060231/http://www.ndcnc.gov.cn/datalib/2004/HundredName/DL/DL-20040216142301 |date=January 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hedonism}}

'''Hedone''' was the personification and goddess of pleasure, enjoyment, and delight. Hedone, also known as [[Voluptas]] in Roman mythology, is the daughter of the Greek gods [[Eros]] (Cupid) and [[Psyche (mythology)|Psyche]]. She was associated more specifically with sensual pleasure. Her opposites were the [[Algos]], personifications of pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hedone|url=http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Hedone.html|website=Theoi Greek Mythology|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hēdonē'' ({{lang|grc|ἡδονή}}) is a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word meaning [[pleasure]], and is the root of the English word "[[wikt:hedonism|hedonism]]". In the [[Epicureanism|philosophy]] of [[Epicurus]], hēdonē is described as a pleasure that may or may not derive from actions that are virtuous, whereas another form of pleasure, ''terpsis'', is always virtuous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warren|first1=James|title=Epicurus and Democritean ethics : an archaeology of ataraxia|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2306">'''Henology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἕν ''hen'', "one") refers to the [[philosophy|philosophical]] account or discourse on "The One" that appears most notably in the philosophy of [[Plotinus]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zAYh3Aeem5YC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=Henology#PPA118,M1 Four ages of Understanding at Google Books] Retrieved on May 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reiner Schürmann]] describes it as a "metaphysics of radical [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]]" that extends beyond [[being]] and intellection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schürmann|first1=Reiner|last2=Lily|first2=Reginald|title=Broken Hegemonies|date=2003|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, Indiana|isbn=0-253-34144-2|pages=143–144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4eRv1DTW_KoC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=Henology#v=onepage&amp;q=Henology&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be contrasted with [[ontology]], as ontology is "an account of being" whereas henology is an "account of unity."

==Areas of inquiry==
Henology stands in contradistinction to several other philosophical disciplines. The term "henology" refers to the discipline that centers around The One, as in the philosophies of [[Plato]] and [[Plotinus]]. It is sometimes used in contradistinction to disciplines that treat [[Being]] as its starting point (as in [[Aristotle]] and [[Avicenna]]) and also to those that seek to understand [[Knowledge]] and [[Truth]] (as in [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[René Descartes|Descartes]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wyller|first1=Egil A.|title=Henologische Perspektiven II: zu Ehren Egil A.

The '''hierarchy of the sciences''' is a theory formulated by [[Auguste Comte]] in the 19th century. This theory states that science develops over time beginning with the simplest and most general scientific discipline, [[astronomy]], which is the first to reach the "positive stage" (one of three in Comte's [[law of three stages]]). As one moves down the "hierarchy", this theory further states that sciences become more complex and less general, and that they will reach the positive stage later. Disciplines further down the hierarchy are said to depend more on the developments of their predecessors; the highest discipline on the hierarchy is the [[social sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://media.pfeiffer.edu/lridener/DSS/Comte/COMTEW4.HTML |title=Comte - The Work - Hierarchy of the Sciences |website=media.pfeiffer.edu |access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, there are higher levels of consensus and faster rates of advancement in [[physics]] and other [[natural sciences]] than there are in the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cole |first=Stephen |date=July 1983 |title=The Hierarchy of the Sciences? |url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/227835 |journal=American Journal of Sociology |language=en |volume=89 |issue=1 |pages=111–139 |doi=10.1086/227835 |issn=0002-9602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==
Research has shown that, after controlling for the number of hypotheses being tested, positive results are 2.3 times more likely in the social sciences than in the physical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fanelli |first=Daniele |date=2010-04-07 |title="Positive" Results Increase Down the Hierarchy of the Sciences |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0010068 |journal=PLOS ONE |language=en |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=e10068 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0010068 |pmc=2850928 |pmid=20383332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been found that the degree of [[scientific consensus]] is highest in the physical sciences, lowest in the social sciences, and intermediate in the [[biological sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fanelli |first=Daniele |last2=Glänzel |first2=Wolfgang |date=2013-06-26 |title=Bibliometric Evidence for a Hierarchy of the Sciences |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0066938 |journal=PLOS ONE |language=en |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=e66938 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0066938 |pmc=3694152 |pmid=23840557}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dean Simonton]] argues that a composite measure of the scientific status of disciplines ranks [[psychology]] much closer to biology than to sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Simonton |first=Dean Keith |date=2004 |title=Psychology's Status as a Scientific Discipline: Its Empirical Placement Within an Implicit Hierarchy of the Sciences. |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2004-11097-002 |journal=Review of General Psychology |language=en |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=59–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{more citations needed|date=August 2014}}
The '''Junto''', also known as the '''Leather Apron Club''', was a club for mutual improvement established in 1727 by [[Benjamin Franklin]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]].  The Leather Apron Club's purpose was to debate questions of morals, politics, and [[natural philosophy]], and to exchange knowledge of business affairs.

==History==
Franklin organized a group of friends to provide a structured form of mutual improvement. The group, initially composed of twelve members, called itself the Junto (the word is a mistaken use of the masculine singular Spanish adjective "joined", mistaken for the feminine singular noun "junta", "a meeting".  Both derive from Latin "iunct-", past participle of "iungere", "to join"). The members of the Junto were drawn from diverse occupations and backgrounds, but they all shared a spirit of inquiry and a desire to improve themselves, their community, and to help others. Among the original members were [[Printer (publisher)|printer]]s, [[Surveying|surveyor]]s, a [[cabinetmaker]], a clerk, and a bartender. Although most of the members were older than Benjamin Franklin, he was clearly their leader.

At just 21, he oversaw five men, including [[Hugh Meredith]], Stephen Potts, and George Webb, who were soon to form the core of the Junto.  Franklin was an outgoing, social individual and had become acquainted with these businessmen. This gathering included prominent merchants who met informally to drink and discuss the business of the day.  Franklin's congenial ways attracted many unique and learned individuals, and from these, he selected the members for the Junto.

All members lived in Philadelphia and came from diverse areas of interest and business.  Along with Meredith, Potts, and Webb, they included Joseph Breintnall, merchant and [[scrivener]], who also loved poetry and natural history. [[Thomas Godfrey (inventor)|Thomas Godfrey]] was a [[glazier]], [[mathematician]], and inventor; and Nicholas Scull and William Parsons were both surveyors.  Scull was also a [[bibliophile]] and Parsons a cobbler and [[Astrology|astrologer]].  William Maugridge was a cabinetmaker, [[William Coleman (judge)|William Coleman]] a merchant's clerk, and Robert Grace a gentleman.  Grace's wealth meant he did not have to work, but apparently he brought an intellectual element to the group and a fine library.  The twelfth member of the Junto remained a mystery until 2007, when Professor George Boudreau of [[Penn State]] discovered a long-forgotten account of the club's refreshments, and verified that shoemaker John Jones Jr. was an original member.  Jones was a Philadelphia Quaker, a neighbor of Franklin's, and later a founding member of the [[Library Company of Philadelphia]].  The club met Friday nights, first in a tavern and later in a house, to discuss moral, political, and scientific topics of the day.

Franklin describes the formation and purpose of the Junto in his [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|autobiography]]:

{{quote|I should have mentioned before, that, in the autumn of the preceding year, [1727] I had form'd most of my ingenious acquaintance into a club of mutual improvement, which we called the Junto; we met on Friday evenings. The rules that I drew up required that every member, in his turn, should produce one or more queries on any point of Morals, Politics, or Natural Philosophy, to be discuss'd by the company; and once in three months produce and read an essay of his own writing, on any subject he pleased.}}

{{quote|Our debates were to be under the direction of a president, and to be conducted in the sincere spirit of inquiry after truth, without fondness for dispute or desire of victory; and to prevent warmth, all expressions of positiveness in opinions, or direct contradiction, were after some time made contraband, and prohibited under small pecuniary penalties.}}

===Prehistory===
Franklin was influenced by two predecessor organizations in particular.

====Dry Club====
One was an English group called the "Dry Club," which had philosopher [[John Locke]], [[William Popple]], and [[Benjamin Furly]] among its members during the 1690s (and was itself partially inspired by Furly's "heretics of the Lantern" society).&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, S. &amp; Schuurman, P., eds. ''Studies on Locke: Sources, Contemporaries, and Legacy'' (2008) pp.&amp;nbsp;163–65&lt;/ref&gt; It met one evening a week for two hours at a time and required that its members reply affirmatively to the following questions:&lt;ref&gt;"Rules of a Society" in ''The Remains of John Locke, Esq.'' (1714) p.&amp;nbsp;113&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
# Whether he loves all Men, of what Profession or Religion soever?
# Whether he thinks no person ought to be harmed in his Body, Name, or Goods, for mere speculative Opinions, or his external way of Worship?
# Whether he loves and seeks Truth for Truth's sake; and will endeavour impartially to find and receive it himself, and to communicate it to others?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Each member of the club would take turns proposing topics for discussion and moderating these discussions. The discussions were to be held in a spirit of open-minded tolerance:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That no Person or Opinion be unhandsomely reflected on; but every Member behave himself with all the temper, judgement, modesty, and discretion he is master of.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Neighborhood benefit and reforming societies====
The other important predecessors were the "neighborhood benefit societies" and "reforming societies" proposed in Massachusetts by [[Cotton Mather]]. Cotton Mather described the neighborhood societies as being composed of a dozen married couples who would meet at one anothers' homes in succession for prayer and other religious exercises, and also to consider questions like the following:&lt;ref&gt;Mather, Cotton ''Essays to do good'' (1825 ed., pp.&amp;nbsp;108–11)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Who are in any peculiar adversity; and what may be done to comfort them?
* What contention or variance may there be among our neighbours; and what may be done for healing it?
* In what open transgressions do any live? and who shall be desired to carry faithful admonitions to them?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The similar reforming societies would entertain questions like these:&lt;ref&gt;Mather, Cotton ''Essays to do good'' (1825 ed., pp.&amp;nbsp;194–95)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Can any further methods be devised that ignorance and wickedness may be more chased from our people in general; and that domestic piety, in particular, may flourish among them?
* Is there any instance of oppression or fraudulence in the dealings of any sort of people, which may call for our efforts to rectify it?
* Is there any matter to be humbly recommended to the legislative power, to be enacted into a law for the public benefit?
* Do we know of any person languishing under severe affliction, and is there any thing we can do for the succour of that afflicted neighbour?
* Has any person a proposal to make, for our further advantage and assistance, that we may be in a better and more regular capacity for prosecuting these intentions?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Questions==
The Junto's Friday evening meetings were organized around a series of questions that Franklin devised, covering a range of intellectual, personal, business, and community topics. These questions were used as a springboard for discussion and community action. In fact, through the Junto, Franklin promoted such concepts as volunteer fire-fighting clubs, improved security (night watchmen), and a public hospital.

===List of questions===
This is the list of questions Franklin devised to guide the discussions at Junto meetings (from Franklin's papers, dated 1728, and included in some editions of his autobiography):&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Franklin, Political, Miscellaneous, and Philosophical Pieces, ed. Benjamin Vaughan, (London, 1779), pp. 533-6 http://franklinpapers.org/franklin/framedVolumes.jsp?vol=1&amp;page=255a&lt;/ref&gt;
# Have you met with any thing in the author you last read, remarkable, or suitable to be communicated to the Junto? Particularly in [[history]], [[morality]], [[poetry]], [[physics]], travels, mechanic arts, or other parts of knowledge?
# What new story have you lately heard agreeable for telling in conversation?

# Do you see any thing amiss in the present customs or proceedings of the Junto, which might be amended?

Any person to be qualified as a member was to stand up, lay his hand upon his chest, over his heart, and be asked the following questions, viz.
# Have you any particular disrespect to any present members? ''Answer.'' I have not.
# Do you sincerely declare that you love mankind in general, of what profession or religion soever? ''Answer.'' I do.
# Do you think any person ought to be harmed in his body, name, or goods, for mere speculative opinions, or his external way of worship? ''Answer.'' No.
# Do you love truth for truth's sake, and will you endeavor impartially to find and receive it yourself, and communicate it to others? ''Answer.'' Yes.

The '''linguistic turn''' was a major development in [[Western philosophy]] during the early 20th century, the most important characteristic of which is the focusing of [[philosophy]] and the other [[humanities]] primarily on the relationship between philosophy and [[language]].

Very different intellectual movements were associated with the "linguistic turn", although the term itself is commonly thought popularised by [[Richard Rorty]]'s 1967 anthology ''The Linguistic Turn'', in which it means the turn towards [[linguistic philosophy]]. According to Rorty, who later dissociated himself from linguistic philosophy and analytic philosophy generally, the phrase "the linguistic turn" originated with philosopher [[Gustav Bergmann]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Rorty]], "Wittgenstein, Heidegger, and the Reification of Language" in Richard Rorty, ''Essays on Heidegger and Others: Philosophical Papers'', Cambridge University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neil Gross, ''Richard Rorty: The Making of an American Philosopher'', University Of Chicago Press, 2008, p. xxix.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analytic philosophy==
Traditionally, the linguistic turn is taken to also mean the birth of [[analytic philosophy]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38153975|title=Origins of analytical philosophy|last=Dummett|first=Michael A.|date=|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=|isbn=0674644735|location=Cambridge. Mass.|pages=5|oclc=38153975}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the results of the linguistic turn was an increasing focus on [[logic]] and [[philosophy of language]], and the cleavage between [[Linguistic philosophy|ideal language philosophy]] and [[ordinary language philosophy]].

===Frege===
According to [[Michael Dummett]], the linguistic turn can be dated to [[Gottlob Frege]]'s 1884 work ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'', specifically paragraph 62 where Frege explores the identity of a numerical proposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/lang-phi/#SH1b|title=Language, Philosophy of – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author=|date=|website=www.iep.utm.edu|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Dummett, "Frege: Philosophy of Mathematics"&lt;/ref&gt; 

In order to answer a [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] question about [[Number|numbers]], "How are numbers given to us, granted that we have no idea or intuition of them?" Frege invokes his "[[context principle]]", stated at the beginning of the book, that only in the context of a proposition do words have meaning, and thus finds the solution to be in defining "the sense of a proposition in which a number word occurs." Thus an [[Ontology|ontological]] and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] problem, traditionally solved along [[Idealism|idealist]] lines, is instead solved along [[Linguistics|linguistic]] ones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Russell and Wittgenstein===
This concern for the logic of propositions and their relationship to "facts" was later taken up by the notable analytic philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] in "[[On Denoting]]", and played a weighty role in his early work in [[logical atomism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hist-analytic.com/RussellLAfacts.pdf The Philosophy of Physical Atomism], p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], an associate of Russell, was one of the progenitors of the linguistic turn. This follows from his ideas in his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' that philosophical problems arise from a misunderstanding of the logic of language, and from his remarks on [[Language game (philosophy)|language games]] in his later work. His later work (specifically ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'') significantly departs from the common tenets of analytic philosophy and might be viewed as having some resonance in the post-structuralist tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Although Wittgenstein never used the term Linguistic turn. See  [http://info.sjc.ox.ac.uk/scr/hacker/docs/Beyond%20the%20linguistic%20turn%20.pdf Analytic Philosophy: Beyond the Linguistic Turn and Back Again] (St. Johns College website)&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Quine and Kripke===
[[W. V. O. Quine]] describes the historical continuity of the linguistic turn with earlier philosophy in [[Two Dogmas of Empiricism|''Two Dogmas of Empiricism'']]: "[[Intension|Meaning]] is what [[essence]] becomes when it is divorced from the object of reference and wedded to the word."&lt;ref&gt;Quine, W. V. O. ''Two Dogmas of Empiricism''&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the twentieth century, philosophers like [[Saul Kripke]] in ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'' drew metaphysical conclusions from closely analyzing language.&lt;ref name="Garrett2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Garrett|title=What Is This Thing Called Metaphysics?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qTmJrtBX-ZkC&amp;pg=PA54|date=25 February 2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-79269-4|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Continental philosophy ==
Decisive for the linguistic turn in the humanities were the works of yet another tradition, namely the [[Continental philosophy|Continental]] [[structuralism]] of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]. Structuralism was the initial outcome of Saussure's linguistic turn, which later led to [[poststructuralism]] with the input of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s ideas.&lt;ref&gt;David Kreps, ''Bergson, Complexity and Creative Emergence'', Springer, 2015, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Influential poststructuralist theorists include [[Judith Butler]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jacques Derrida]]. The power of language, more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes, in historical discourse was explored by [[Hayden White]].

These various movements often lead to the notion that language 'constitutes' reality, a position contrary to intuition and to most of the Western tradition of philosophy. The traditional view (what Derrida called the 'metaphysical' core of Western thought) saw words as functioning labels attached to concepts.  According to this view, there is something like 'the ''real'' chair', which exists in some external reality and corresponds roughly with a concept in human thought, ''chair'', to which the linguistic word "chair" refers. However, the founder of structuralism, Ferdinand de Saussure, held that definitions of concepts cannot exist independently from a linguistic system defined by difference, or, to put it differently, that a concept of something cannot exist without being named. Thus differences between meanings structure our perception; there is no ''real'' chair except insofar as we are manipulating symbolic systems. We would not even be able to recognize a chair ''as'' a chair without simultaneously recognising that a chair is ''not'' everything else - in other words a chair is defined as being a specific collection of characteristics which are themselves defined in certain ways, and so on, and all of this within the symbolic system of language. Thus, a large part of what we think of as ''reality'' is really a convention of naming and characterising, a convention which is itself called ''language''.

'''Lysander Spooner''' (January 19, 1808&amp;nbsp;– May 14, 1887) was an American [[Political philosophy|political philosopher]], [[essay]]ist, [[Pamphleteer|pamphlet writer]], [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], [[Jurisprudence|legal theorist]], and entrepreneur of the nineteenth century. He was a strong advocate of the labor movement and severely anti-authoritarian and individualist in his political views.

Spooner's most famous writing includes the seminal abolitionist book ''[[The Unconstitutionality of Slavery]]'', and ''[[No Treason: The Constitution of No Authority]]'' which opposed treason charges against secessionists. He is also known for competing with the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Post Office]] with his [[American Letter Mail Company]], which closed after legal problems with the federal government.

==Life overview==
Spooner was born on a farm in [[Athol, Massachusetts]], on January 19, 1808, and died on May 14, 1887, in [[Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin Tucker]], "Our Nestor Taken From Us."&lt;/ref&gt;

Spooner advocated what he called [[Natural law|Natural Law]]{{spaced ndash}} or the "Science of Justice"{{spaced ndash}} wherein acts of initiatory [[coercion]] against individuals and their property, such as [[tax]]ation, were considered criminal because they were immoral while the so-called criminal acts that violated only man-made (arbitrary) legislation were not necessarily criminal.&lt;ref&gt;Spooner, Lysander, [https://mises.org/journals/lar/pdfs/3_1/3_1_7.pdf Natural Law, or the Science of Justice]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
{{Libertarianism sidebar}}

===Legal career===
Spooner's activism began with his career as a lawyer, which itself violated Massachusetts law.&lt;ref&gt;p. viii, Introduction in The Lysander Spooner Reader, ed. George H. Smith, Fox and Wilkes 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Spooner had studied law under the prominent lawyers and politicians [[John Davis (Massachusetts governor)|John Davis]] and [[Charles Allen (Massachusetts politician)|Charles Allen]], but he had never attended college.&lt;ref name=McKivigan&gt;McKivigan, John, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OeoaqhaZ-iMC&amp;pg=PA67 Abolitionism and American Law], pg. 66–67&lt;/ref&gt; According to the laws of the state, college graduates were required to study with an attorney for three years, while non-graduates were required to do so for five years.&lt;ref name=McKivigan/&gt;

With the encouragement of his legal mentors, Spooner set up his practice in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] after only three years, defying the courts.&lt;ref name=McKivigan/&gt; He regarded the three-year privilege for college graduates as a state-sponsored discrimination against the poor and also providing a monopoly income to those who met the requirements. He argued that "no one has yet ever dared advocate, in direct terms, so monstrous a principle as that the rich ought to be protected by law from the competition of the poor".&lt;ref name=McKivigan/&gt; In 1836, the legislature abolished the restriction.&lt;ref name=McKivigan/&gt; He opposed all licensing requirements for lawyers, doctors or anyone else that was prevented from being employed by such requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lysanderspooner.org/node/5 |title=Biography |publisher=LysanderSpooner.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630071436/http://lysanderspooner.org/node/5 |archivedate=June 30, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent a person from doing business with a person without a professional license he saw as a violation of the natural [[Freedom of contract|right to contract]].&lt;ref&gt;Spooner, Lysander [https://books.google.com/books?id=L8Q7AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=%22lysander+spooner%22+%22natural+right+to+contract%22+license&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2#v=onepage Constitutional Law, Relative to Credit, Currency and Banking], pg. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

After a disappointing legal career and a failed career in real estate speculation in [[Ohio]], Spooner returned to his father's farm in 1840.&lt;ref name=McKivigan/&gt;

===American Letter Mail Company===
Being an advocate of [[self-employment]] and opponent of government regulation of business, Spooner started his own business called [[American Letter Mail Company]] which competed with the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Post Office]]. Postal rates were notoriously high in the 1840s,&lt;ref name=Cato&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj15n1-1.html |title=The Challenge To The U.S. Postal Monopoly, 1839–1851 |publisher=Cato.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510175038/http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj15n1-1.html |archivedate=May 10, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1844, Spooner founded the American Letter Mail Company, which had offices in various cities, including [[Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia]], and New York.&lt;ref&gt;McMaster, John Bach. 1910. A History of the People of the United States. D. Appleton and Company. p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Stamps could be purchased and then attached to letters which could be sent to any of its offices. From here agents were dispatched who traveled on railroads and steamboats, and carried the letters in hand bags. Letters were transferred to messengers in the cities along the routes who then delivered the letters to the addressees.

This was a challenge to the United States Post Office's [[monopoly]].&lt;ref name="Cato" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adie, Douglas, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wPmIGtrxXb0C&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=%22lysander+spooner%22+%22post+office%22+monopoly&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lysander%20spooner%22%20%22post%20office%22%20monopoly Monopoly Mail: the Privatizing United States Postal Service], pg. 27&lt;/ref&gt; As he had done when challenging the rules of the [[Massachusetts Bar Association]], he published a [[pamphlet]] titled "The Unconstitutionality of the Laws of Congress Prohibiting Private Mails". Although Spooner had finally found commercial success with his mail company, legal challenges by the government eventually exhausted his financial resources. A law enacted in 1851 that strengthened the federal government's monopoly finally put him out of business. The lasting legacy of Spooner's challenge to the postal service was the three-cent stamp, adopted in response to the competition his company provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lysanderspooner.org/STAMP3.htm |title=Spooner vs. U.S. Postal System |first=Lucille J. |last=Goodyear |work=''lysanderspooner.org; originally published in'' American Legion Magazine |date=January 1981 |accessdate=October 25, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019155313/http://www.lysanderspooner.org/STAMP3.htm |archivedate=October 19, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abolitionism==
{{Anarchism sidebar}}
Spooner attained his greatest fame as a figure in the abolitionist movement. His most famous work, a book titled ''[[The Unconstitutionality of Slavery]]'', was published in 1845. Spooner's book contributed to a controversy among abolitionists over whether the [[United States Constitution]] supported the institution of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]]. The "disunionist" faction, led by [[William Lloyd Garrison]] and [[Wendell Phillips]], argued the Constitution legally recognized and enforced the oppression of slaves (as, for example, in the provisions for the capture of fugitive slaves in Article IV, Section 2).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |last1=Barnett |first1=Randy E. |authorlink=Randy Barnett |title=Whence Comes Section One? The Abolitionist Origins of the Fourteenth Amendment |date=2010-02-22 |url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1538862 |publisher=Social Science Research Network |location=Rochester, NY |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masshist.org/objects/2005july.cfm |title=Donald Yacovone, Massachusetts Historical Society: "A Covenant with Death and an Agreement with Hell" |publisher=Masshist.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229221730/http://masshist.org/objects/2005july.cfm |archivedate=December 29, 2010 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, Wendell Phillips disputed Spooner's notion that any unjust law should be held legally void by judges.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Wendell.  ''[https://archive.org/details/reviewoflysander00lcphil Review of Spooner's Essay on the Unconstitutionality of Slavery]'' (1847).&lt;/ref&gt;

Spooner challenged the claim that the text of the Constitution permitted slavery.&lt;ref name=UOS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lysanderspooner.org/UnconstitutionalityOfSlaveryContents.htm |title=The Unconstitutionality of Slavery |publisher=Lysanderspooner.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728111559/http://www.lysanderspooner.org/UnconstitutionalityOfSlaveryContents.htm |archivedate=July 28, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he recognized that the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founders]] had probably not intended to outlaw slavery when writing the Constitution, he argued that only the meaning of the text, not the private intentions of its writers, was enforceable. Spooner used a complex system of legal and natural law arguments in order to show that the clauses usually interpreted as supporting slavery did not, in fact, support it, and that several clauses of the Constitution prohibited the states from establishing slavery.&lt;ref name=UOS/&gt; Spooner's arguments were cited by other pro-Constitution abolitionists, such as [[Gerrit Smith]] and the [[Liberty Party (United States, 1840)|Liberty Party]], which adopted it as an official text in its 1848 platform. [[Frederick Douglass]], originally a Garrisonian disunionist, later came to accept the pro-Constitution position, and cited Spooner's arguments to explain his change of mind.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Douglass, "[[What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?]]"&lt;/ref&gt;

From the publication of this book until 1861, Spooner actively campaigned against slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lysanderspooner.org/node/7 |title=Letters by Lysander Spooner |publisher=Lysanderspooner.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630074426/http://lysanderspooner.org/node/7 |archivedate=June 30, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He published subsequent pamphlets on [[Jury nullification]] and other legal defenses for escaped slaves and offered his legal services, often free of charge, to fugitives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2181&amp;Itemid=28 |title=Lysander Spooner, ''An Essay on the Trial by Jury'' (1852) |publisher=Oll.libertyfund.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1850s, copies of his book were distributed to members of Congress sparking some debate over their contents. Even Senator [[Albert G. Brown|Albert Gallatin Brown]] of [[Mississippi]], a slavery proponent, praised the argument's intellectual rigor and conceded it was the most formidable legal challenge he had seen from the abolitionists to date. In 1858, Spooner circulated a "Plan for the Abolition of Slavery", calling for the use of [[guerrilla warfare]] against slaveholders by black slaves and non-slaveholding free Southerners, with aid from Northern abolitionists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://praxeology.net/LS-PAS.htm |title=Lysander Spooner – Plan for the Abolition of Slavery |publisher=Praxeology.net |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spooner also "conspir[ed] with [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] to promote a servile insurrection in the South", and participated in an aborted plot to free Brown after his capture following the failed raid on [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harper's Ferry]], [[Virginia]] (Harper's Ferry is now part of the state of [[West Virginia]]).&lt;ref name=Raico&gt;[[Ralph Raico|Raico, Ralph]] (2011-03-29) [https://mises.org/daily/5088/Neither-the-Wars-Nor-the-Leaders-Were-Great Neither the Wars Nor the Leaders Were Great], [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Spooner had advocated the use of violence to abolish slavery, he denounced the Republicans' use of violence to prevent the Southern states from seceding during the [[American Civil War]]. He published several letters and pamphlets about the war, arguing that the Republican objective was not to eradicate slavery, but rather to preserve the Union by force. He blamed the bloodshed on Republican political leaders, such as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]] and Senator [[Charles Sumner]], who often criticized slavery but would not attack it on a constitutional basis, and who pursued military policies seen as vengeful and abusive.&lt;ref name="oll.libertyfund.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2233&amp;Itemid=28 |title=Lysander Spooner, Letter to Charles Sumner (1864) |publisher=Oll.libertyfund.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/dilorenzo/dilorenzo87.html |title=Spooner's Fiery Attack on Lincolnite Hypocrisy by Thomas DiLorenzo |publisher=Lewrockwell.com |date=2004-11-26 |accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he denounced the institution of slavery, Spooner recognized the right of the [[Confederate States of America]] to secede as the manifestation of government by consent, a constitutional and legal principle fundamental to Spooner's philosophy; the Northern states, in contrast, were trying to deny the [[Southern United States|Southerners]] that right through military force.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lysander Spooner Reader'', by George H. Smith, pp. xvii and further&lt;/ref&gt; He "vociferously opposed the Civil War, arguing that it violated the right of the southern states to secede from a Union that no longer represented them".&lt;ref name=Raico/&gt; He believed they were attempting to restore the Southern states to the Union, against the wishes of Southerners. He argued that the right of the states to secede derives from the natural right of slaves to be free.&lt;ref name="oll.libertyfund.org"/&gt; This argument was unpopular in the North and in the South after the War began, as it conflicted with the official position of both governments.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lysander Spooner Reader'', by George H. Smith, p. xix&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on economics and self-employment==
Spooner believed that it was beneficial for people to be [[Self-employment|self-employed]] so that they could enjoy the full benefits of their labor rather than having to share them with an employer. He argued that various forms of government intervention in the free market made it difficult for people to start their own businesses. For one, he believed that laws against high interest rates, or [[usury]], prevented those with [[Capital (economics)|capital]] from extending credit because they could not be compensated for high risks of not being repaid: &lt;blockquote&gt;"If a man have not capital of his own, upon which to bestow his labor, it is necessary that he be allowed to obtain it on credit. And in order that he may be able to obtain it on credit, it is necessary that he be allowed to contract for such a rate of interest as will induce a man, having surplus capital, to loan it to him; for the capitalist cannot, consistently with natural law, be compelled to loan his capital against his will. All legislative restraints upon the rate of interest, are, therefore, nothing less than arbitrary and tyrannical restraints upon a man's natural capacity amid natural right to hire capital, upon which to bestow his labor...The effect of usury laws, then, is to give a monopoly of the right of borrowing money, to those few, who can offer the most approved security".&lt;ref&gt;Spooner, Lysander. 1846. ''Poverty: Its Illegal Causes and Legal Cure''. Boston: [[Bela Marsh]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Spooner also believed that government restrictions on issuance of private money made it inordinately difficult for individuals to obtain the capital on credit to start their own businesses, thereby putting them in a situation where "a very large portion of them, to save themselves from starvation, have no alternative but to sell their labor to others" and those who do employ others are only able to afford to pay "far below what the laborers could produce, [than] if they themselves had the necessary capital to work with."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Spooner's Letter to Grover Cleveland May 15, 1886&lt;/ref&gt; Spooner said that there was "a prohibitory tax – a tax of ten per cent. – on all notes issued for circulation as money, other than the notes of the United States and the national banks" which he argued caused an artificial shortage of credit, and that eliminating this tax would result in making plenty of money available for lending&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; such that: "All the great establishments, of every kind, now in the hands of a few proprietors, but employing a great number of wage labourers, would be broken up; for few or no persons, who could hire capital and do business for themselves would consent to labour for wages for another".&lt;ref&gt;quoted from Spooner's Letter to Grover Cleveland by Eunice Minette Schuster, ''Native American Anarchism'', p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anarchism==
{{Libertarian socialism}}
[[George Woodcock]] describes Spooner's essays as an "eloquent elaboration" of [[Josiah Warren]] and the early American development of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon's ideas]], and associates his works with that of [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woodcock|first=George|authorlink=George Woodcock|title=Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements|year=1962|publisher=Penguin|location=Melbourne}} p. 434&lt;/ref&gt; Woodcock also reports that both Lysander Spooner and [[William Batchelder Greene]] had been members of the [[Socialism|socialist]] [[International Workingmen's Association|First International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woodcock|first=George|authorlink=George Woodcock|title=Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements|year=1962|publisher=Penguin|location=Melbourne}} p. 460&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and death==
[[File:Lysander Spooner Grave.JPG|thumb|250px|''Spooner's tombstone, he is interred in the historic [[Forest Hills Cemetery]]'']]
Spooner continued to write and publish extensively during the decades following Reconstruction, producing works such as "Natural Law or The Science of Justice" and "Trial By Jury". In "Trial By Jury" he defended the doctrine of [[jury nullification]], which holds that in a free society a trial jury not only has the authority to rule on the facts of the case, but also on the legitimacy of the law under which the case is tried. This doctrine would further allow juries to refuse to convict if they regard the law by which they are asked to convict as illegitimate. He became associated with [[Benjamin Tucker]]'s [[anarchism|anarchist]] journal ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'', which published all of his later works in serial format, and for which he wrote several editorial columns on current events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uncletaz.com/liberty/spooner.html |title=Lysander Spooner, Tucker &amp; Liberty |publisher=Uncletaz.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that "almost all fortunes are made out of the capital and labour of other men than those who realize them. Indeed, except by his sponging capital and labour from others".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in [[James J. Martin|Martin, James J.]] ''Men Against the State'', pp. 173ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Spooner died on May 14, 1887, at the age of 79 in his residence, 109 Myrtle Street, Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lysanderspooner.org/OBIT.htm |title=One of the Old Guard of Abolition Heroes, Dies in His Eightieth Year After a Fortnight's Illness |publisher=Lysanderspooner.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718051644/http://www.lysanderspooner.org/OBIT.htm |archivedate=July 18, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Tucker]] arranged his funeral service and wrote a "loving [[obituary]]", entitled "Our [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] Taken From Us", which appeared in ''Liberty'' on May 28, and predicted "that the name Lysander Spooner would be 'henceforth memorable among men'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Wendy McElroy|McElroy, Wendy]], [http://fff.org//explore-freedom/article/lysander-spooner-part-2/ Lysander Spooner, Part 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Spooner's influence extends to the wide range of topics he addressed during his lifetime. He is remembered primarily for his abolitionist activities and for his challenge to the [[United States Postal Service|Post Office]] monopoly, which had a lasting influence of significantly reducing postal rates.&lt;ref&gt;Krohn, Raymond James, [https://mises.org/journals/jls/21_2/21_2_3.pdf The Limits of Jacksonian Liberalism: Individualism, Dissent, and the Gospel of Andrew According to Lysander Spooner], ''[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]'', Volume 21, No. 2 (Summer 2007), pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; Spooner's writings contributed to the development of both [[Left-libertarianism|left-libertarian]] and [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] political theory in the United States, and were often reprinted in early libertarian journals such as the ''Rampart Journal''&lt;ref&gt;"A Letter to Thomas F. Bayard," in ''Rampart Journal'' Vol. 1, No. 1 (Spring 1965), "No Treason: The Constitution of No Authority," with an introduction by James J. Martin, in ''Rampart Journal'' Vol. 1, No. 3 (Fall 1965).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Left and Right: A Journal of Libertarian Thought]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/journals/lar/pdfs/3_1/3_1_7.pdf ''Natural Law, Or the Science of Justice''], reprinted in ''[[Left and Right: A Journal of Libertarian Thought]]'' (Winter 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; His writings were also a major influence on [[Austrian School]] economist [[Murray Rothbard]] and right-libertarian law professor and legal theorist [[Randy Barnett]].

In January 2004, [[Laissez Faire Books]] established the Lysander Spooner Award for advancing the literature of liberty. The honor is awarded monthly to the most important contributions to right-libertarian literature, followed by an annual award to the winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lfb.com/index.php?action=help&amp;helpfile=spooneraw.html |title=Lysander Spooner Award |publisher=Lfb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, LAVA created the Lysander Spooner (Book of the Year) Award, which has been awarded annually since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;LAVA [https://web.archive.org/web/20110413234211/http://www.lava-apa.org/ The Libertarian, Agorist, Voluntaryist &amp; Anarchs Authors and Publishers Association]&lt;/ref&gt; The LAVA Awards are held annually to honor excellence in books relating to the principles of liberty, with the Lysander Spooner Award being the grand prize award.

Spooner's ''The Unconstitutionality of Slavery'' was cited in the 2008 Supreme Court case ''[[District of Columbia v. Heller]]'', which struck down the federal district's ban on [[handgun]]s&lt;nowiki/&gt;. Justice [[Antonin Scalia]], writing for the court, quotes Spooner as saying the [[Right to keep and bear arms|right to bear arms]] was necessary for those who wanted to take a stand against slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/554/07-290/opinion.html |title=District of Columbia v.

S. ____ – US Supreme Court Cases from Justia &amp; Oyez |publisher=Supreme.justia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also cited by Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] in his concurring opinion in ''[[McDonald v.

[[File:MertonRuleOresme.jpg|thumb|Oresme's geometric verification of the Oxford Calculators' Merton Rule of uniform acceleration, or mean speed theorem.]]
[[File:Galileo-1638-173.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Galileo]]'s demonstration of the law of the space traversed in case of uniformly varied motion. It is the same demonstration that [[Oresme]] had made centuries earlier.]]

In the 14th-century, the [[Oxford Calculators]] of [[Merton College]] and French collaborators such as [[Nicole Oresme]] proved the '''mean speed theorem''', also known as the '''Merton rule''' of [[uniform acceleration]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Grant]], ''A Source Book in Medieval Science'' (1974) Vol. 1, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''Merton mean speed theorem'''. It essentially says that: a uniformly accelerated body (starting from rest, i.e., zero initial velocity) travels the same distance as a body with [[speed|uniform speed]] whose speed is half the final velocity of the accelerated body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl B. |last=Boyer |authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of the Calculus and Its Conceptual Development |publisher=Dover |year=1959 |isbn=978-0-486-60509-8 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=KLQSHUW8FnUC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  |chapter=III. Medieval Contributions |pages=79–89 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KLQSHUW8FnUC}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Details==
Oresme essentially provided a geometrical verification for the generalized Merton Rule, which we would express today as &lt;math&gt;s = \frac{1}{2}(v_0 + v_f)t&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., distance traveled is equal to one half of the sum of the initial and final velocities, multiplied by the elapsed time), by finding the area of a [[trapezoid]].&lt;ref&gt;C. H. Edwards, Jr., ''The Historical Development of the Calculus'' (1979) pp. 88-89.&lt;/ref&gt;  Clay tablets used in [[Babylonian astronomy]] (350–50 BC) present trapezoid procedures for computing Jupiter's position and [[Displacement (vector)|motion]] and anticipate the theorem by 14 centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ossendrijver |first=Mathieu |date=29 Jan 2016 |title=Ancient Babylonian astronomers calculated Jupiter’s position from the area under a time-velocity graph |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6272/482.full |journal=Science |publisher= |volume=351 |issue=6272 |pages=482–484 |doi=10.1126/science.aad8085 |access-date=29 January 2016|bibcode = 2016Sci...351..482O |pmid=26823423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The medieval scientists demonstrated this theorem — the foundation of "[[Law of falling bodies|the law of falling bodies]]" — long before [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], who is generally credited with it. The mathematical physicist and historian of science [[Clifford Truesdell]], wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Truesdell, ''Essays in The History of Mechanics'', (Springer-Verlag, New York, 1968), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|The now published sources prove to us, beyond contention, that the main [[kinematical]] properties of [[uniformly accelerated motion]]s, still attributed to [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] by the physics texts, were discovered and proved by scholars of Merton college.... In principle, the qualities of Greek physics were replaced, at least for motions, by the numerical quantities that have ruled Western science ever since. The work was quickly diffused into [[France]], [[Italy]], and other parts of [[Europe]]. Almost immediately, [[Giovanni di Casali|Giovanni di Casale]] and [[Nicole Oresme]] found how to represent the results by geometrical [[Graph of a function|graphs]], introducing the connection between [[geometry]] and the physical world that became a second characteristic habit of Western thought ...}}

The theorem is a special case of the more general kinematics equations for uniform acceleration.

The '''Modern Greek Enlightenment''' ({{lang-el|Διαφωτισμός}}, ''Diafotismos'', "enlightenment," "illumination") was the Greek expression of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

==Origins==
{{further information|Ottoman Greece}}
The Greek Enlightenment was given impetus by the Greek predominance in trade and education in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Greek [[merchant]]s financed a large number of young Greeks to study in universities in [[Renaissance Italy|Italy]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire|German states]]. There they were introduced to the ideas of the Enlightenment and the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name=BritannicaA&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Greek history, Intellectual Revival'', 2008 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the wealth of the extensive [[Greeks|Greek]] merchant class that provided the material basis for the intellectual revival that was the prominent feature of Greek life in the half century and more leading to 1821.  It was not by chance that on the eve of the [[Greek War of Independence]] the most important centres of Greek learning, schools-cum-universities, were situated in [[Ioannina]], [[Chios]], [[Smyrna]] (Izmir) and [[Ayvalik]], all major centres of Greek commerce.&lt;ref name=BritannicaB&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Greek history, The mercantile middle class'', 2008 ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of the Phanariotes===
The [[Phanariotes]] were a small caste of Greek families who took their collective name from the [[Phanar]] quarter of [[Constantinople]] where the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate]] is still housed. They held various administrative posts within the [[Ottoman Empire]], the most important of which were those of [[hospodar]], or prince, of the [[Danubian principalities]] of [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]]. Most hospodars acted as patrons of Greek culture, education, and printing. These academies attracted teachers and pupils from throughout the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] commonwealth, and there was some contact with intellectual trends in [[Habsburg]] central Europe. For the most part they supported the Ottoman system of government, too much to play a significant part in the emergence of the Greek national movement; however, their support of learning produced many highly educated Greek scholars who benefited from the cosmopolitan environment the Phanariotes cultivated in their principalities.&lt;ref name=BritannicaC&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Greek history, Transformation toward emancipation, The Phanariotes'', 2008 ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

This environment was in general a special attraction for young, ambitious and educated Greek people from the Ottoman Empire, contributing to their national enlightenment. The Princely Academies of [[Princely Academy of Bucharest|Bucharest]] and [[Princely Academy of Iaşi|Iasi]] also played a crucial role in this movement. Characteristically the authors of the ''[[Geographia Neoteriki]]'', one of the most remarkable works of that era, [[Daniel Philippidis]] and [[Grigorios Konstantas]], were both educated in this environment.&lt;ref name=Kopecek&gt;{{cite book |first=Michal |last=Kopeček |title= Discourses of collective identity in Central and Southeast Europe (1770–1945): texts and commentaries |language=|year=2006|pages= 73–79|ref= |isbn=978-963-7326-52-3| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k5Vsjg508EYC&amp;pg=PA74 |publisher=Central European University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Roland |last=Sussex |first2= Eade|last2= John Christopher|title=Culture and nationalism in nineteenth-century Eastern Europe |language=|year=1985|page= 8|ref= |isbn=978-0-89357-146-7| url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=oMYPTZOCG8eAswbmse30DA&amp;ct=result&amp;id=eQZpAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Grigorios+Konstantas+in+their+New+Geography%22&amp;q=%22Daniil+Philippidis+and+Grigorios+Konstantas+in+their+New+Geography+of+1791%2C+one+of+the+most+remarkable+works+of+the+%27Neo-Hellenic+Enlightenment%27%2C+%22#search_anchor |publisher=Slavica Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

One effect was the creation of an [[Attic Greek|atticized]] form of Greek by linguistic purists, which was adopted as the official [[state language|language of the state]] and came to be known as ''[[Katharevousa]]'' (purified). This created [[diglossia]] in the Greek linguistic sphere, in which ''Katharevousa'' and the vernacular idiom known as [[Demotic Greek|''Dimotiki'']] were in conflict until the latter half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=BritannicaA/&gt;

The transmission of Enlightenment ideas into Greek thought also influenced the development of a national consciousness. The publication of the journal [[Hermes o Logios]] encouraged the ideas of the Enlightenment. The journal's objective was to advance Greek science, philosophy and culture.  Two of the main figures of the Greek Enlightenment, [[Rigas Feraios]] and [[Adamantios Korais]], encouraged Greek nationalists to pursue contemporary political thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= M. Kitromilides |first= Paschalis | title=The Dialectic of Intolerance: Ideological Dimensions of Ethnic Conflict | publisher=Journal of the Hellnice Diaspora | year=1979 | editor= |url= http://triceratops.brynmawr.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10066/5243/Kitromilides_6_4.pdf;jsessionid=D85E79913BFF8FCAF6D4228BE8B3CEAC?sequence=1 | isbn=  | page =4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek Enlightenment concerned not only language and the [[humanities]] but also the [[sciences]]. Some scholars such as [[Methodios Anthrakites]], [[Evgenios Voulgaris]], [[Athanasios Psalidas]], [[Balanos Vasilopoulos]] and [[Nikolaos Darbaris]] had a background in [[Mathematics]] and the [[Physical Sciences]] and published scientific books into Greek for use in Greek schools. [[Rigas Feraios]] also published an Anthology of Physics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13082">'''Neo-medievalism''' (or '''neomedievalism''', '''new medievalism''') is a term with a long history&lt;ref&gt;"neo-medieval", s.v. "neo-, comb. form." OED Online. Oxford University Press, June 2017. Web. 27 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; that has acquired specific technical senses in two branches of scholarship. In political theory about modern [[international relations]], where the term is originally associated with [[Hedley Bull]], it sees the political order of a globalized world as analogous to high-medieval Europe, where neither states nor the Church, nor other territorial powers, exercised full sovereignty, but instead participated in complex, overlapping and incomplete sovereignties.&lt;ref name=Kobrin&gt;Stephen J. Kobrin. [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.131.6106&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf "Back to the Future: Neomedievalism and the Postmodern Digital World Economy"].&lt;/ref&gt; In literary theory about the use and abuse of texts and tropes from the Middle Ages in [[postmodernity]]. The use of ''neomedieval'' in this sense was popularized by the Italian medievalist [[Umberto Eco]] in his 1986 essay "Dreaming of the Middle Ages".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[Umberto Eco]], "Dreaming of the Middle Ages," in ''Travels in Hyperreality'', transl. by W. Weaver, NY: Harcourt Brace, 1986, pp. 61–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political theory==
The idea of neomedievalism in political theory was first discussed in 1977 by theorist [[Hedley Bull]] in ''[[The Anarchical Society|The Anarchical Society: A Study of Order in World Politics]]'' to describe the erosion of state [[sovereignty]] in the contemporary globalized world:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is also conceivable that sovereign states might disappear and be replaced not by a world government but by a modern and secular equivalent of the kind of universal political organisation that existed in Western Christendom in the Middle Ages. In that system no ruler or state was sovereign in the sense of being supreme over a given territory and a given segment of the Christian population; each had to share authority with vassals beneath, and with the Pope and (in Germany and Italy) the Holy Roman Emperor above. The universal political order of Western Christendom represents an alternative to the system of states which does not yet embody universal government.&lt;ref&gt;Hedley Bull, ''The Anarchical Society: A Study of Order in World Politics'', 3rd edn (Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2002), pp. 245–46 [first publ. London: Macmillan, 1977].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Thus Bull suggested society might move towards "a new mediaevalism" or a "neo-mediaeval form of universal political order", in which individual notions of rights and a growing sense of a "world common good" were undermining [[Nation-state|national]] [[sovereignty]]. He proposed that such a system might help "avoid the classic dangers of the system of sovereign states by a structure of overlapping structures and cross-cutting loyalties that hold all peoples together in a universal society while at the same time avoiding the concentration inherent in a world government", though "if it were anything like the precedent of Western Christendom, it would contain more ubiquitous and continuous violence and insecurity than does the modern states system".&lt;ref&gt;Hedley Bull, ''The Anarchical Society: A Study of Order in World Politics'', 3rd edn (Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2002), p. 246 [first publ. London: Macmillan, 1977].&lt;/ref&gt;

In this reading, [[globalization]] has resulted in an international system which resembles the medieval one, where political authority was exercised by a range of non-territorial and overlapping agents, such as religious bodies, [[principalities]], [[empires]] and [[city-states]], instead of by a single political authority in the form of a state which has complete sovereignty over its territory. Comparable processes characterising Bull's "new medievalism" include the increasing powers held by regional organisations such as the [[European Union]], as well as the spread of sub-national and devolved governments, such as those of [[Scotland]] and [[Catalonia]]. These challenge the exclusive authority of the state. [[Private military companies]], [[multinational corporations]] and the resurgence of worldwide religious movements (e.g. [[political Islam]]) similarly indicate a reduction in the role of the state and a decentralisation of power and authority.

[[Stephen J. Kobrin]] in 1998 added the forces of the digital world economy to the picture of neomedievalism. In an article entitled "Back to the Future: Neomedievalism and the Postmodern Digital World Economy" in the ''Journal of International Affairs'',&lt;ref name="Kobrin" /&gt; he argued that the sovereign state as we know it{{snd}}defined within certain territorial borders{{snd}}is about to change profoundly, if not to wither away, due in part to the digital world economy created by the Internet, suggesting that cyberspace is a trans-territorial domain operating outside of the jurisdiction of national law.

[[Anthony Clark Arend]] also argued in his 1999 book ''Legal Rules and International Society'' that the international system is moving toward a "neo-medieval" system. He claimed that the trends that Bull noted in 1977 had become even more pronounced by the end of the twentieth century. Arend argues that the emergence of a "neo-medieval" system would have profound implications for the creation and operation of international law.

Although Bull originally envisioned neomedievalism as a positive trend, it has its critics. [[Bruce Holsinger]] in ''Neomedievalism, Neoconservatism, and the War on Terror'' argues that [[neoconservative]]s "have exploited neomedievalism's conceptual slipperiness for their own tactical ends."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/N/bo5456671.html|title=Neomedievalism, Neoconservatism, and the War on Terror|publisher=University of Chicago Press Books|accessdate=2017-12-05|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102062453/http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/N/bo5456671.html|archivedate=2017-01-02|deadurl=no|quote=While international-relations theorists promote neomedievalism as a model for understanding emergent modes of global sovereignty, neoconservatives exploit its conceptual slipperiness for their own tactical ends.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Philip G. Cerny's "Neomedievalism, Civil War and the New Security Dilemma" (1998) also sees neomedievalism as a negative development and claims that the forces of globalization increasingly undermine nation-states and interstate forms of governance "by cross-cutting linkages among different economic sectors and social bonds,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cerny|first=Philip G.|date=1998|title=Neomedievalism, civil war and the new security dilemma: Globalisation as durable disorder |url= |journal=Civil Wars|volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=42 |doi=10.1080/13698249808402366 |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; calling globalization a "durable disorder" which eventually leads to the emergence of the new security dilemmas that had analogies in the Middle Ages. Cerny identifies six characteristics of a neomedieval world that contribute to this disorder: multiple competing institutions; lack of exogenous territorializing pressures both on sub-national and international levels; uneven consolidation of new spaces, cleavages, conflicts and inequalities; fragmented loyalties and identities; extensive entrenchment of property rights; and spread of the "grey zones" outside the law as well as black economy.

==Neo-medievalism and medieval studies==
{{See also|Medievalism}}
An early use of the term ''neo-medievalism'' in a sense like Umberto Eco's was in [[Isaiah Berlin]]'s 1953 "[[The Hedgehog and the Fox]]": &lt;blockquote&gt;There is no kinship between him [[Joseph de Maistre|[Joseph de Maistre]]] and those who really did believe in the possibility of some kind of return{{snd}} neo-medievalists from Wackenroder and Görres and Cobbett to G. K. Chesterton, and Slavophils and Distributists and Pre-Raphaelites and other nostalgic romantics; for he believed, as Tolstoy also did, in the exact opposite: in the "inexorable" power of the present moment: in our inability to do away with the sum of conditions which cumulatively determine our basic categories, an order which we can never fully describe or, otherwise than by some immediate awareness of it, come to know.&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Berlin, ''The Hedgehog and the Fox: An Essay on Tolstoy’s View of History'' (London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1953), p.76.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Then, in 1986, Umberto Eco said "we are at present witnessing, both in Europe and America, a period of renewed interest in the Middle Ages, with a curious oscillation between fantastic neomedievalism and responsible philological examination".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Recently, the term has been used by various writers such as [[medievalist|medieval historians]] who see it as the intersection between popular fantasy and [[Middle Ages|medieval history]]&lt;ref&gt;David Ketterer (2004). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Xh5wFOn256wC&amp;pg=RA1-PA211&amp;lpg=RA1-PA211&amp;dq=%22neo+medievalism%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Q0nAw3mTxu&amp;sig=4sqtdAulyPgPJn6_sEyDsxWImLM#PRA1-PA211,M1 "Chapter 18: Fantasic Neomedievalism"] by Kim Selling, in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Xh5wFOn256wC Flashes of the Fantastic]''.&lt;/ref&gt; as a term describing the [[post-modern]] study of medieval history.&lt;ref&gt;Cary John Lenehan. [http://www.tased.edu.au/tasonline/sca/thesis-d.htm "Postmodern Medievalism"], [[University of Tasmania]], November 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

The widespread interest in medieval themes in [[popular culture]], especially [[computer games]] such as [[MMORPG]]s, [[film]]s and [[television]], [[neo-medieval music]], and popular [[literature]], has been called ''neomedieval''. Critics have discussed why medieval themes continue to fascinate audiences in a modern, heavily technological world. A possible explanation is the need for a [[romantic nationalism|romanticized historical narrative]] to clarify the confusing panorama of current political and cultural events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eddostern.com/texts/Stern_TOME.html|author=Eddo Stern|title=A Touch of Medieval: Narrative, Magic and Computer Technology in Massively Multiplayer Computer Role-Playing Games|publisher=Tampre University Press 2002|accessdate=2006-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academics have paid increasing attention to neomedievalism, in what some see as a burgeoning field of study. Important works include Carol L. Robinson and Pamela Clements 2009 paper “Living with Neomedievalism,” in ''Studies in Medievalism'',&lt;ref&gt;Carol L. Robinson and Pamela Clements, “Living with Neomedievalism,” ''Studies in Medievalism'' 18 (2009): 55–75&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson and Clements’ anthology ''The Medieval in Motion: Neomedievalism in Film, Television and Electronic Games'' (forthcoming), a collection of papers from MEMS (Medieval Electronic Multimedia Organization),&lt;ref&gt;[http://medievalelectronicmultimedia.org/publications.html ''The Medieval in Motion: Neomedievalism in Film, Television and Electronic Games''] at MEMS.&lt;/ref&gt; the academic journal ''Studies in Medievalism: Defining Neomedievalism(s)'',&lt;ref&gt;Karl Fugelso (ed.), ''Studies in Medievalism: Defining Neomedievalism(s)'', D. S. Brewer, Cambridge, 2010. {{ISBN|9781843842286}}&lt;/ref&gt; panels at the 2009 Annual International Congress on Medieval Studies in Kalamazoo, Michigan included “Neomedievalist Communities” and “Gaming Neomedievally”, and it was the official focus of the entire 22nd Annual International Conference on Medievalism, “Neomedievalisms” (2007).

(p. 126)|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''obscurantism'' derives from the title of the 16th-century satire ''[[Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum]]'' (1515–19, ''Letters of Obscure Men''), that was based upon the [[intellectualism|intellectual]] dispute between the German humanist [[Johann Reuchlin]] and the monk [[Johannes Pfefferkorn]] of the [[Dominican Order]], about whether or not all [[Judaism|Jewish]] books should be [[Book burning|burned]] as un-Christian heresy. Earlier, in 1509, the monk Pfefferkorn had obtained permission from [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]] (1486–1519), to burn all copies of the [[Talmud]] ([[Jewish law]] and [[Jewish ethics]]) known to be in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (AD 926–1806); the ''Letters of Obscure Men'' satirized the Dominican arguments for burning "un-Christian" works.

In the 18th century, [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers applied the term ''obscurantist'' to any enemy of intellectual enlightenment and the liberal diffusion of knowledge. In the 19th century, in distinguishing the varieties of obscurantism found in [[metaphysics]] and [[theology]] from the "more subtle" obscurantism of the [[critical philosophy]] of [[Immanuel Kant]], and of modern [[philosophical skepticism]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] said: "The essential element in the black art of obscurantism is not that it wants to darken individual understanding, but that it wants to blacken our picture of the world, and darken our idea of existence."&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, F. (1878) ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'' Vol. II, Part 1, 27. Cambridge University Press; 2 edition (November 13, 1996). {{ISBN|978-0-521-56704-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In restricting knowledge to an [[Elite|élite]] ruling class of "the few", obscurantism is fundamentally [[anti-democratic]], because its component [[anti-intellectualism]] and [[elitism]] exclude the people as [[intellect]]ually unworthy of knowing the facts and truth about the [[government]] of their [[City-State]].&lt;ref name=Hersh&gt;[[Seymour Hersh|Seymour M.

In 18th century monarchic France, the [[Marquis de Condorcet]], as a [[political science|political scientist]], documented the [[aristocracy]]'s obscurantism about the social problems that provoked the [[French Revolution]] (1789–99) that deposed them and their [[List of French monarchs|King]], [[Louis XVI of France]].

In the 19th century, the [[mathematics|mathematician]] [[William Kingdon Clifford]], an early proponent of [[Darwinism]], devoted some writings to uprooting obscurantism in England, after hearing clerics—who privately agreed with him about evolution—publicly denounce [[evolution]] as un-[[Christianity|Christian]]. Moreover, in the realm of organized religion, obscurantism is a distinct strain of thought independent of theologic allegiance. The distinction is that fundamentalism presupposes sincere religious belief, whereas obscurantism is based upon minority manipulation of the popular faith as political praxis; cf. [[Censorship]].&lt;ref name = Obs&gt;Syed, I. (2002) [http://www.irfi.org/articles/articles_51_100/obscurantism.htm "Obscurantism"]. From: ''Intellectual Achievements of Muslims''.

=== Leo Strauss ===

==== Political philosophy ====
In the 20th century, the American conservative [[political philosophy|political philosopher]] [[Leo Strauss]], for whom philosophy and politics intertwined, and his [[Neoconservatism|Neo-conservative]] adherents adopted the notion of government by the enlightened few as political strategy. He noted that [[intellectuals]], dating from [[Plato]], confronted the dilemma of either an informed populace "interfering" with government, or if it were possible for [[Value (ethics)|good]] politicians to be truthful and still govern to maintain a stable society—hence the [[Noble Lie]] necessary in securing public acquiescence. In ''The City and Man'' (1964), he discusses the myths in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' that Plato proposes effective governing requires, among them, the belief that the country (land) ruled by the State belongs to it (despite some having been conquered from others), and that citizenship derives from more than the [[accident of birth]] in the City-State. Thus, in the ''New Yorker'' magazine article ''Selective Intelligence'', [[Seymour Hersh]] observes that Strauss endorsed the "[[Noble Lie]]" concept: the myths politicians use in maintaining a cohesive society.&lt;ref name="Hersh"&gt;[[Seymour Hersh|Seymour M. Hersh]], [http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/05/12/selective-intelligence "Selective Intelligence"], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 12 May 2003, accessed April 29, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reason"&gt;Brian Doherty, [http://www.reason.com/9707/fe.bailey.shtml "Origin of the Specious: Why Do Neoconservatives Doubt Darwin?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725170209/http://www.reason.com/9707/fe.bailey.shtml|date=2008-07-25}}, ''[[Reason Online]]'' July 1997, accessed 16 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shadia Drury]] criticized Strauss's acceptance of dissembling and deception of the populace as "the peculiar justice of the wise", whereas Plato proposed the Noble Lie as based upon [[Morality|moral]] good. In criticizing ''Natural Right and History'' (1953), she said that "Strauss thinks that the superiority of the ruling philosophers is an intellectual superiority and not a moral one ... [he] is the only interpreter who gives a sinister reading to Plato, and then celebrates him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/faith-iraqwarphiloshophy/article_1542.jsp|title=Noble lies and perpetual war: Leo Strauss, the neocons, and Iraq|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Esoteric texts ====
Leo Strauss also was criticized for proposing the notion of "esoteric" meanings to ancient texts, obscure knowledge inaccessible to the "ordinary" intellect. In ''Persecution and the Art of Writing'' (1952), he proposes that some philosophers write esoterically to avert persecution by the political or religious authorities, and, per his knowledge of [[Maimonides]], [[Al Farabi]], and [[Plato]], proposed that an esoteric writing style is proper for the philosophic text. Rather than explicitly presenting his thoughts, the philosopher's esoteric writing compels the reader to think independently of the text, and so learn. In the ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phædrus]]'', Socrates notes that writing does not reply to questions, but invites dialogue with the reader, thereby minimizing the problems of grasping the written word. Strauss noted that one of writing's political dangers is students' too-readily accepting dangerous ideas—as in the trial of [[Socrates]], wherein the relationship with [[Alcibiades]] was used to prosecute him.

For Leo Strauss, philosophers' texts offered the reader lucid "exoteric" (salutary) and obscure "esoteric" (true) teachings, which are concealed to the reader of ordinary intellect; emphasizing that writers often left contradictions and other errors to encourage the reader's more scrupulous (re-)reading of the text. In observing and maintaining the "[[exoteric]]&amp;nbsp;– [[esoteric]]" dichotomy, Strauss was accused of obscurantism, and for writing esoterically. 

=== Bill Joy ===
[[File:Bill joy.jpg|thumb|right|125px|[[Bill Joy]]]]
In the ''Wired'' magazine article, "[[Why the Future Doesn't Need Us]]" (April 2000), the computer scientist [[Bill Joy]], then a [[Sun Microsystems]] chief scientist, in the sub-title proposed that: "Our most powerful twenty-first-century technologies—robotics, genetic engineering, and nanotech[nology]—are threatening to make humans an endangered species"; in the body, he posits that:

:"The experiences of the atomic scientists clearly show the need to take personal responsibility, the danger that things will move too fast, and the way in which a process can take on a life of its own. We can, as they did, create insurmountable problems in almost no time flat. We must do more thinking up front if we are not to be similarly surprised and shocked by the consequences of our inventions."&lt;ref&gt;Khushf, George (2004). "The Ethics of Nanotechnology: Vision and Values for a New Generation of Science and Engineering", ''Emerging Technologies and Ethical Issues in Engineering'', National Academy of Engineering, pp. 31–32. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. {{ISBN|0-309-09271-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joy's proposal for limiting the dissemination of "certain" knowledge, in behalf of preserving society, was quickly likened to obscurantism. A year later, the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], in the ''Science and Technology Policy Yearbook 2001'', published the article "A Response to Bill Joy and the Doom-and-Gloom Technofuturists", wherein the computer scientists [[John Seely Brown]] and Paul Duguid countered his proposal as technological tunnel vision, and the predicted technologically derived problems as infeasible, for disregarding the influence of non-scientists upon such societal problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/ch4.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031231160458/http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/ch4.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2003-12-31 |title=A Response to Bill Joy and the Doom-and- Gloom Technofuturists }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appeal to emotion ==
[[File:Friedrich Hayek portrait.jpg|thumb|right|175px|&lt;center&gt;The economist [[Friedrich August von Hayek]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
In the essay "Why I Am Not a Conservative" (1960), the economist [[Friedrich von Hayek]] said that political [[conservatism]] is ideologically unrealistic, because of the conservative person’s inability to adapt to changing human realities and refusal to offer a positive political program that benefits everyone in a society. In that context, Hayek used the term ''obscurantism'' differently, to denote and describe the [[denial]] of the empirical truth of scientific theory, because of the disagreeable [[Morality|moral]] consequences that might arise from acceptance of fact.

== Deliberate obscurity ==
The second sense of ''obscurantism'' denotes making knowledge abstruse, that is, difficult to grasp. In the 19th and 20th centuries obscurantism became a [[polemics|polemical]] term for accusing an author of deliberately writing obscurely, in order to hide his or her [[intellectualism|intellectual]] vacuousness. Philosophers who are neither [[empiricism|empiricists]] nor [[positivism|positivists]] often are considered obscurantists when describing the abstract concepts of their disciplines. For philosophic reasons, such authors might modify or reject verifiability, falsifiability, and logical non-contradiction. From that perspective, obscure (clouded, vague, abstruse) writing does not necessarily indicate that the writer has a poor grasp of the subject, because unintelligible writing sometimes is purposeful and philosophically considered.&lt;ref name=Rorty&gt;Rorty, Richard (1989) ''Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, Ch. 6: "From Ironist Theory to Private Allusions: Derrida". {{ISBN|0-521-36781-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|right|120px|&lt;center&gt;[[Aristotle]]&lt;/center&gt;]]

=== Aristotle ===
In contemporary discussions of [[virtue ethics]], [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (''The Ethics'') stands accused of ethical obscurantism, because of the technical, philosophic language and writing style, and their purpose being the [[education]] of a cultured governing [[elite]].&lt;ref name=b&gt;Lisa van Alstyne, "Aristotle's Alleged Ethical Obscurantism." ''Philosophy,'' Vol. 73, No. 285 (July, 1998), pp. 429–452.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kant ===
[[Immanuel Kant]] employed technical terms that were not commonly understood by the layman. [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] contended that post-Kantian philosophers such as [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] deliberately imitated the abstruse style of writing practiced by Kant.&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, ''Manuscript Remains'', Vol. 4, "Cogitata I," §&amp;nbsp;107.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hegel ===
[[File:G.W.F. Hegel (by Sichling, after Sebbers).jpg|thumb|120px|&lt;center&gt;[[G. W. F. Hegel]]&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]]'s philosophy, and the philosophies of those he influenced, especially [[Karl Marx]], have been accused of obscurantism. [[Analytic philosophy|Analytic]] and [[Logical positivism|positivistic]] philosophers, such as [[A. J. Ayer]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and the [[Critical Rationalism|critical-rationalist]] [[Karl Popper]], accused Hegel and [[Hegelianism]] of being obscure. About Hegel's philosophy, Schopenhauer wrote that it is: "...&amp;nbsp;a colossal piece of mystification, which will yet provide posterity with an inexhaustible theme for laughter at our times, that it is a pseudo-philosophy paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking, and, by the most outrageous misuse of language, putting in its place the hollowest, most senseless, thoughtless, and, as is confirmed by its success, most stupefying verbiage.&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur (1965). ''On the Basis of Morality'', trans. E.F.J. Payne. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, pp.15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, biographer Terry Pinkard notes "Hegel has refused to go away, even in analytic philosophy, itself."&lt;ref&gt;''Hegel: A Biography'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000, xii.&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel was aware of his obscurantism, and perceived it as part of philosophical thinking: to accept and transcend the limitations of quotidian (everyday) thought and its concepts. In the essay "Who Thinks Abstractly?", he said that it is not the philosopher who thinks abstractly, but the layman, who uses concepts as [[:wikt:given|givens]] that are immutable, without context. It is the philosopher who thinks concretely, because he transcends the limits of quotidian [[concept]]s, in order to understand their broader context. This makes philosophical thought and language appear obscure, esoteric, and mysterious to the layman.

=== Marx ===
[[File:Marx4.jpg|thumb|120px|right|&lt;center&gt;[[Karl Marx]] in 1861&lt;/center&gt;]]

In his early works,&lt;ref&gt;See his ''[[The German Ideology]]'' (1844), ''[[The Poverty of Philosophy]]'' (1845), and ''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]'' (1847).&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Marx criticized German and French philosophy, especially [[German Idealism]], for its traditions of German irrationalism and ideologically motivated obscurantism.&lt;ref&gt;See, Dallmayr, Fred R., "The Discourse of Modernity: Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger (and Habermas)", ''PRAXIS International'' (4/1988), pp. 377–404.&lt;/ref&gt; Later thinkers whom he influenced, such as the philosopher [[György Lukács]] and social theorist [[Jürgen Habermas]], followed with similar arguments of their own.&lt;ref&gt;[[György Lukács]]'s ''The Destruction of Reason''; [[Jürgen Habermas]]'s ''The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity''&lt;/ref&gt; However, philosophers such as Karl Popper and Friedrich Hayek in turn criticized Marx and [[Marxism|Marxist]] philosophy as obscurantist (however, see [[#Appeal to emotion|above]] for Hayek's particular interpretation of the term).&lt;ref&gt;Wright, E. O., Levine, A., &amp; Sober, E. (1992). ''Reconstructing Marxism: essays on explanation and the theory of history''. London: Verso, 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heidegger ===
[[Martin Heidegger]], and those influenced by him, such as [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Emmanuel Levinas]], have been labeled obscurantists by critics from analytic philosophy and the [[Critical theory (Frankfurt School)|Frankfurt School of critical theory]]. Of Heidegger, [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote, "his philosophy is extremely obscure. One cannot help suspecting that language is here running riot. An interesting point in his speculations is the insistence that nothingness is something positive. As with much else in Existentialism, this is a psychological observation made to pass for logic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Russell|first = Bertrand|authorlink = Bertrand Russell|title = Wisdom of the West|publisher = Crescent Books|year = 1989|pages = 303|isbn = 978-0-517-69041-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is Russell's complete entry on Heidegger, and it expresses the sentiments of many 20th-century analytic philosophers concerning Heidegger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0801485649|title=Heidegger: An Introduction|first=Richard|last=Polt|date=7 January 1999|publisher=Cornell University Press|accessdate=11 February 2017|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Derrida ===
In their obituaries, "Jacques Derrida, Abstruse Theorist, Dies at 74" (10 October 2004) and "Obituary of Jacques Derrida, French intellectual" (21 October 2004), ''[[The New York Times]]'' newspaper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/10/obituaries/10derrida.html|title=Jacques Derrida, Abstruse Theorist, Dies in Paris at 74|date=10 October 2004|work=The New York Times|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Economist]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=3308320|title=Jacques Derrida|date=21 October 2004|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017|via=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; described Derrida as a deliberately obscure philosopher.

In ''[[Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity]]'' (1989), [[Richard Rorty]] proposed that in ''The Post Card: From Socrates to Freud and Beyond'' (1978), Jacques Derrida purposefully used undefinable words (e.g. [[Différance]]), and used defined words in contexts so diverse that they render the words unintelligible, hence, the reader is unable to establish a context for his literary self. In that way, the philosopher Derrida escapes metaphysical accounts of his work. Since the work ostensibly contains no metaphysics, Derrida has, consequently, escaped metaphysics.&lt;ref name=Rorty /&gt;

Derrida's philosophic work is especially controversial among American and British academics, as when the [[University of Cambridge]] awarded him an honorary doctorate, despite opposition from among the Cambridge philosophy faculty and analytical philosophers worldwide. In opposing the decision, philosophers including [[Barry Smith (academic and ontologist)|Barry Smith]], [[W. V. O. Quine]], [[David Malet Armstrong|David Armstrong]], [[Ruth Barcan Marcus]], [[René Thom]], and twelve others, published a letter of protestation in ''[[The Times]]'' of London, arguing that "his works employ a written style that defies comprehension ... [thus] Academic status based on what seems to us to be little more than semi-intelligible attacks upon the values of reason, truth, and scholarship is not, we submit, sufficient grounds for the awarding of an honorary degree in a distinguished university."&lt;ref&gt;Barry Smith et al., "Open letter against Derrida receiving an honorary doctorate from Cambridge University," ''The Times'' [London], 9 May 1992. [http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith/varia/Derrida_Letter.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''New York Review of Books'' article "An Exchange on Deconstruction" (February 1984), [[John Searle]] comments on [[Deconstruction]]: "... anyone who reads deconstructive texts with an open mind is likely to be struck by the same phenomena that initially surprised me: the low level of philosophical argumentation, the deliberate obscurantism of the prose, the wildly exaggerated claims, and the constant striving to give the appearance of profundity, by making claims that seem paradoxical, but under analysis often turn out to be silly or trivial."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mackey| first = Louis H.| title = An Exchange on Deconstruction (Reply by John R. Searle)| journal = New York Review of Books| volume = 31| issue = 1| date = February 2, 1984| url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/5964| accessdate = 2007-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lacan ===
[[Jacques Lacan]] was an [[intellectual]] who defended obscurantism to a degree. To his students' complaint about the deliberate obscurity of his lectures, he replied: "The less you understand, the better you listen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=7Xw4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=%22The+less+you+understand,+the+better+you+listen%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20less%20you%20understand%2C%20the%20better%20you%20listen%22&amp;f=false | title = The ego in Freud's theory and in the technique of psychoanalysis, 1954–1955 | isbn = 978-0-521-31801-3 | author1 = Lacan | first1 = Jacques | year = 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1973 seminar ''Encore'', he said that his ''Écrits'' (''Writings'') were not to be understood, but would effect a meaning in the reader, like that induced by mystical texts. The obscurity is not in his writing style, but in the repeated allusions to Hegel, derived from [[Alexandre Kojève]]'s lectures on Hegel, and similar theoretic divergences.

=== Sokal Affair ===

The [[Sokal Affair]] (1996) was a publishing [[hoax]] that the professor of physics [[Alan Sokal]] perpetrated on the editors and readers of ''[[Social Text]]'', an [[academic journal]] of [[postmodernism|post-modern]] [[cultural studies]] that was not then a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] publication. In 1996, as an experiment testing [[publishing|editorial]] integrity (fact-checking, verification, peer review, etc.), Sokal submitted "Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity", a [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] article proposing that physical reality is a social construct, in order to learn if ''Social Text'' would "publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if: (a) it sounded good, and, (b) it flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions".&lt;ref name = Physicist&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html| title = A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies| accessdate= April 3, 2007| last = Sokal| first = Alan D.| authorlink = Alan Sokal| work = [[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]| date =May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sokal's fake article was published in the Spring/Summer 1996 issue of ''Social Text'', which was dedicated to the [[Science Wars]] about the conceptual validity of [[scientific objectivity]] and the nature of scientific theory, among [[Scientific realism|scientific realists]] and postmodern critics in American universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.physics.nyu.edu/~as2/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html| title = Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity| accessdate= 3 April 2007| last = Sokal| first = Alan D.| authorlink = Alan Sokal| date = Spring–Summer 1996 |origyear=1994 (original version published 1994-11-28, revised 1995-05-13)| work = [[Social Text]]|issue= 46/47| publisher = [[Duke University]] Press| pages = 217–252|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070326153354/http://www.physics.nyu.edu/~as2/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;|archivedate = 26 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sokal's ''raison de guerre'' ("war reason") for publication of a false article was that postmodernist critics questioned the objectivity of science, by criticising the [[scientific method]] and the nature of knowledge, usually in the disciplines of cultural studies, [[cultural anthropology]], [[feminist studies]], [[comparative literature]], [[media studies]], and [[science and technology studies]]. Whereas the scientific realists countered that objective scientific knowledge exists, riposting that postmodernist critics almost knew nothing of the science they criticized. In the event, editorial deference to "[[Appeal to Authority|Academic Authority]]" (the Author-Professor) prompted the editors of ''Social Text'' not to fact-check Sokal's manuscript by submitting it to peer review by a scientist.

Later, concerning the lack of editorial integrity shown by the publication of his fake article in ''Social Text'' magazine, Sokal addressed the matter in the May 1996 edition of the ''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'' journal, in the article "A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies", in which he (Sokal) announced that his transformative hermeneutics article was a [[parody]], submitted "to test the prevailing intellectual standards", and concluded that, as an academic publication, ''Social Text'' ignored the requisite [[intellectual rigor]] of verification and "felt comfortable publishing an article on [[quantum physics]] without bothering to consult anyone knowledgeable in the subject".&lt;ref name = Physicist /&gt;&lt;ref name="LinguaFranca"&gt;{{cite news | last = Sokal| first = Alan | title = A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies | pages = 2| newspaper = Lingua Franca| date = May–June 1996| url = http://www.ee.bgu.ac.il/~censor/katz-directory/01-07-17sokal-lingua-franca-experiment.pdf| accessdate =27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, as a [[Intellectual|public intellectual]], Sokal said his hoax was an action protesting against the contemporary tendency towards obscurantism—abstruse, esoteric, and vague writing in the [[social sciences]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In short, my concern over the spread of [[subjectivism|subjectivist]] thinking is both intellectual and political. Intellectually, the problem with such doctrines is that they are false (when not simply meaningless). There is a real world; its properties are not merely social constructions; facts and evidence do matter. What sane person would contend otherwise? And yet, much contemporary academic theorizing consists precisely of attempts to blur these obvious truths—the utter absurdity of it all being concealed through obscure and pretentious language.&lt;ref name = Physicist /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Philosophy of religion sidebar |God}}
{{Atheism sidebar |arguments}}

The '''omnipotence paradox''' is a family of [[paradox]]es that arise with some understandings of the term 'omnipotent'. The paradox arises, for example, if one assumes that an omnipotent being has no limits and is capable of realizing any outcome, even logically contradictory ideas such as creating square circles. A no-limits understanding of omnipotence such as this has been rejected by theologians from  [[Thomas Aquinas]] to contemporary philosophers of religion, such as [[Alvin Plantinga's free will defense|Alvin Plantinga]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=God, Freedom, and Evil|last=Plantinga|first=Alvin|publisher=Eerdmans|year=1977|isbn=0-8028-1731-9|location=Grand Rapids, MI:|pages=Chapter 4|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atheological arguments based on the omnipotence paradox are sometimes described as evidence for atheism, though Christian theologians and philosophers, such as [[Norman Geisler]] and [[William Lane Craig]], contend that a no-limits understanding of omnipotence is not relevant to orthodox Christian theology.  Other possible resolutions to the paradox hinge on the definition of omnipotence applied and the nature of God regarding this application and whether or not omnipotence is directed toward God himself or outward toward his external surroundings.

The omnipotence paradox has medieval origins, dating at least to the 12th century. It was addressed by [[Averroës]]&lt;ref name="TT"&gt;[[Averroës]], ''Tahafut al-Tahafut (The Incoherence of the Incoherence)'' trans. Simon Van Den Bergh, Luzac &amp; Company 1969, sections 529–536&lt;/ref&gt; and later by [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref name=TA/&gt; [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] (before 532) has a predecessor version of the paradox, asking whether it is possible for God to "deny himself".

The most well-known version of the omnipotence paradox is the so-called ''paradox of the stone'': "Could God create a stone so heavy that even He could not lift it?"&lt;ref name="Savage, C. Wade 1967 pp. 74"&gt;Savage, C. Wade. "The Paradox of the Stone" ''Philosophical Review'', Vol. 76, No. 1 (Jan., 1967), pp. 74–79 {{doi|10.2307/2182966}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phrasing of the omnipotence paradox is vulnerable to objections based on the physical nature of [[gravity]], such as how the [[weight]] of an object depends on what the local gravitational field is. Alternative statements of the paradox that do not involve such difficulties include "If given the axioms of Euclidean geometry, can an omnipotent being create a triangle whose angles do not add up to 180 degrees?" and "Can God create a prison so secure that he cannot escape from it?".

==Overview==
A common modern version of the omnipotence paradox is expressed in the question: "Can [an omnipotent being] create a stone so heavy that it cannot lift it?" This question generates a dilemma. The being can either create a stone it cannot lift, or it cannot create a stone it cannot lift. If the being ''can'' create a stone that it cannot lift, then it seems that it can cease to be omnipotent. If the being ''cannot'' create a stone it cannot lift, then it seems it is already not omnipotent.&lt;ref name="Savage, C. Wade 1967 pp. 74"/&gt;

A related issue is whether the concept of 'logically possible' is different for a world in which omnipotence exists than a world in which omnipotence does not exist.

The dilemma of omnipotence is similar to another classic paradox—the [[irresistible force paradox]]: ''What would happen if an irresistible force were to meet an immovable object?'' One response to this paradox is to disallow its formulation, by saying that if a force is irresistible, then by definition there is no immovable object; or conversely, if an immovable object exists, then by definition no force can be irresistible. Some claim{{who|date=May 2015}} that the only way out of this paradox is if the irresistible force and immovable object never meet. But this is not a way out, because an object cannot in principle be immovable if a force exists that can in principle move it, regardless of whether the force and the object actually meet.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://curiosity.com/topics/the-omnipotence-paradox-has-puzzled-people-for-centuries-curiosity/|title=The Omnipotence Paradox Has Puzzled People For Centuries|website=curiosity.com|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--If they are GUARANTEED not to meet then I don't see what the problem is.--&gt;

==Types of omnipotence==
{{Main|Omnipotence}}
[[Peter Geach]] describes and rejects four levels of omnipotence. He also defines and defends a lesser notion of the "almightiness" of God.

#"Y is '''absolutely omnipotent'''" means that "Y" can do anything that can be expressed in a string of words even if it is self-[[contradiction|contradictory]]: "Y" is not bound by the laws of logic."&lt;ref name="Geach"&gt;Geach, P. T. "Omnipotence" 1973 in Philosophy of Religion: Selected Readings, Oxford University Press, 1998, pp. 63–75&lt;/ref&gt;   
#"Y is '''omnipotent'''" means "Y can do X" is true [[if and only if]] X is a logically consistent description of a state of affairs. This position was once advocated by [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref name=TA&gt;[[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas, Thomas]] [[Summa Theologica]] Book 1 Question 25 article 3&lt;/ref&gt; This definition of omnipotence solves some of the paradoxes associated with omnipotence, but some modern formulations of the paradox still work against this definition. Let X = "to make something that its maker cannot lift." As [[George I. Mavrodes|Mavrodes]] points out there is nothing logically contradictory about this. A man could, for example, make a boat that he could not lift.&lt;ref name="Mavrodes"&gt;Mavrodes, George. "[http://spot.colorado.edu/~kaufmad/courses/Mavrodes.pdf Some Puzzles Concerning Omnipotence]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}" first published 1963 now in The Power of God: readings on Omnipotence and Evil. Linwood Urban and Douglass Walton eds. Oxford University Press 1978 pp. 131–34&lt;/ref&gt;   
#"Y is '''omnipotent'''" means "Y can do X" is true if and only if "Y does X" is logically consistent. Here the idea is to exclude actions that are inconsistent for Y to do but might be consistent for others. Again sometimes it looks as if Aquinas takes this position.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aquinas]] [[Summa Theologica]] Book 1 Question 25 article 4 response #3&lt;/ref&gt; Here Mavrodes' worry about X= "to make something its maker cannot lift" is no longer a problem, because "God does X" is not logically consistent. However, this account may still have problems with moral issues like X = "tells a lie" or temporal issues like X = "brings it about that Rome was never founded."&lt;ref name = "Geach" /&gt;
#"Y is '''omnipotent'''" means whenever "Y will bring about X" is logically possible, then "Y can bring about X" is true. This sense, also does not allow the paradox of omnipotence to arise, and unlike definition #3 avoids any temporal worries about whether or not an omnipotent being could change the past. However, Geach criticizes even this sense of omnipotence as misunderstanding the nature of God's promises.&lt;ref name = "Geach" /&gt;
#"Y is '''almighty'''" means that Y is not just more powerful than any creature; no creature can compete with Y in power, even unsuccessfully.&lt;ref name="Geach" /&gt; In this account nothing like the omnipotence paradox arises, but perhaps that is because God is not taken to be in any sense omnipotent. On the other hand, [[Anselm of Canterbury]] seems to think that almightiness is one of the things that make God count as omnipotent.&lt;ref name = "amselm"&gt;[[Anselm of Canterbury]] Proslogion Chap VII in The Power of God: readings on Omnipotence and Evil. Linwood Urban and Douglass Walton eds. Oxford University Press 1978 pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo]] in his [[City of God (book)|City of God]] writes "[[God]] is called omnipotent on account of His doing what He wills" and thus proposes the definition that "Y is '''omnipotent'''" means "If Y wishes to do X then Y can and does do X". 
 
The notion of omnipotence can also be applied to an entity in different ways. An '''essentially omnipotent''' being is an entity that is necessarily omnipotent. In contrast, an '''accidentally omnipotent''' being is an entity that can be omnipotent for a temporary period of time, and then becomes non-omnipotent. The omnipotence paradox can be applied to each type of being differently.&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;Hoffman, Joshua, Rosenkrantz, Gary. [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2002/entries/omnipotence/ "Omnipotence"] ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2002 Edition)''. Edward N. Zalta (ed.). (Accessed on 19 April 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Philosophers, such as [[René Descartes]], argue that God is absolutely omnipotent.&lt;ref name="Descartes, Rene 1641"&gt;Descartes, Rene, 1641. ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]''. Cottingham, J., trans., 1996. Cambridge University Press. Latin original. Alternative English title: ''Metaphysical Meditations''. Includes six ''Objections and Replies''. A second edition published the following year, includes an additional ‘’Objection and Reply’’ and a ''Letter to Dinet''&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some philosophers have considered the assumption that a being is either omnipotent or non-omnipotent to be a [[false dilemma]], as it neglects the possibility of varying degrees of omnipotence.&lt;ref name=Haeckel1&gt;[[Ernst Haeckel|Haeckel, Ernst]]. ''The Riddle of the Universe.'' Harper and Brothers, 1900.&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern approaches to the problem have involved [[semantics|semantic]] debates over whether language—and therefore philosophy—can meaningfully address the concept of omnipotence itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein, Ludwig.]] [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]] (6.41 and following)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed answers==

===Omnipotence doesn't mean breaking the laws of logic===

A common response from Christian philosophers, such as [[Norman Geisler]] or [[William Lane Craig]], is that the paradox assumes a wrong definition of omnipotence. Omnipotence, they say, does not mean that God can do anything ''at all'' but, rather, that he can do ''anything that's possible according to his nature.'' The distinction is important. God cannot perform logical absurdities; he cannot, for instance, make 1+1=3. Likewise, God cannot make a being greater than himself because he is, by definition, the greatest possible being. God is limited in his actions to his nature. The Bible supports this, they assert, in passages such as Hebrews 6:18, which says it is "impossible for God to lie."

Another common response to the omnipotence paradox is to try to define omnipotence to mean something weaker than absolute omnipotence, such as definition 3 or 4 above. The paradox can be resolved by simply stipulating that omnipotence does not require that the being have abilities that are logically impossible, but only be able to do anything that conforms to the laws of logic. A good example of a modern defender of this line of reasoning is George Mavrodes.&lt;ref name = "Mavrodes" /&gt; Essentially, Mavrodes argues that it is no limitation on a being's omnipotence to say that it cannot make a round square. Such a "task" is termed by him a "pseudo-task" as it is self-contradictory and inherently nonsense. [[Harry Frankfurt]]—following from Descartes—has responded to this solution with a proposal of his own: that God can create a stone impossible to lift and also lift said stone&lt;blockquote&gt;For why should God not be able to perform the task in question? To be sure, it is a task—the task of lifting a stone which He cannot lift—whose description is self-contradictory. But if God is supposed capable of performing one task whose description is self-contradictory—that of creating the problematic stone in the first place—why should He not be supposed capable of performing another—that of lifting the stone? After all, is there any greater trick in performing two logically impossible tasks than there is in performing one?&lt;ref name="frankfurt"&gt;Frankfurt, Harry. "The Logic of Omnipotence" first published in 1964 in ''[[Philosophical Review]]'' and now in ''Necessity, Volition, and Love''. [[Cambridge University Press]] November 28, 1998 pp.1–2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If a being is ''accidentally omnipotent'', it can resolve the paradox by creating a stone it cannot lift, thereby becoming non-omnipotent. Unlike essentially omnipotent entities, it is possible for an accidentally omnipotent being to be non-omnipotent. This raises the question, however, of whether or not the being was ever truly omnipotent, or just capable of great power.&lt;ref name="Hoffman" /&gt; On the other hand, the ability to voluntarily give up great power is often thought of as central to the notion of the Christian Incarnation.&lt;ref name="gore"&gt;Gore, Charles, "A Kenotic Theory of Incarnation" first published 1891, in The Power of God: readings on Omnipotence and Evil. Linwood Urban and Douglass Walton eds. Oxford University Press 1978 pp. 165–68&lt;/ref&gt;

If a being is ''essentially omnipotent'', then it can also resolve the paradox (as long as we take omnipotence not to require absolute omnipotence). The omnipotent being is essentially omnipotent, and therefore it is impossible for it to be non-omnipotent. Further, the omnipotent being can do what is logically impossible—just like the accidentally omnipotent—and have no limitations except the inability to become non-omnipotent. The omnipotent being cannot create a stone it cannot lift.

The omnipotent being cannot create such a stone because its power is equal to itself—thus, removing the omnipotence, for there can only be one omnipotent being, but it nevertheless retains its omnipotence. This solution works even with definition 2—as long as we also know the being is essentially omnipotent rather than accidentally so. However, it is possible for non-omnipotent beings to compromise their own powers, which presents the paradox that non-omnipotent beings can do something (to themselves) which an essentially omnipotent being cannot do (to itself). This was essentially the position [[Augustine of Hippo]] took in his ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'':&lt;blockquote&gt;For He is called omnipotent on account of His doing what He wills, not on account of His suffering what He wills not; for if that should befall Him, He would by no means be omnipotent. Wherefore, He cannot do some things for the very reason that He is omnipotent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf102.iv.V.10.html|title=NPNF1-02. St. Augustine's City of God and Christian Doctrine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus Augustine argued that God could not do anything or create any situation that would, in effect, make God not God.

In a 1955 article in the philosophy journal ''Mind'', [[J. L. Mackie]] tried to resolve the paradox by distinguishing between first-order omnipotence (unlimited power to act) and second-order omnipotence (unlimited power to determine what powers to act things shall have).&lt;ref&gt;[[J. L. Mackie|Mackie, J. L.]], "Evil and Omnipotence." ''Mind'' LXIV, No, 254 (April 1955).&lt;/ref&gt; An omnipotent being with both first and second-order omnipotence at a particular time might restrict its own power to act and, henceforth, cease to be omnipotent in either sense. There has been considerable philosophical dispute since Mackie, as to the best way to formulate the paradox of omnipotence in formal logic.&lt;ref name = "TPoG"&gt;The Power of God: Readings on Omnipotence and Evil. Linwood Urban and Douglass Walton eds. Oxford University Press 1978. Keene and Mayo disagree p. 145, Savage provides 3 formalizations p. 138–41, Cowan has a different strategy p. 147, and Walton uses a whole separate strategy p. 153–63&lt;/ref&gt;

;God and logic

: &lt;p&gt;Although the most common translation of the noun "Logos" is "Word" other translations have been used. Gordon Clark (1902–1985), a Calvinist theologian and expert on pre-Socratic philosophy, famously translated Logos as "Logic": "In the beginning was the Logic, and the Logic was with God and the Logic was God." He meant to imply by this translation that the laws of logic were derived from God and formed part of Creation, and were therefore not a secular principle imposed on the Christian world view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt;&lt;p&gt;God obeys the laws of logic because God is eternally logical in the same way that God does not perform evil actions because God is eternally good. So, God, by nature logical and unable to violate the laws of logic, cannot make a boulder so heavy he cannot lift it because that would violate the [[law of non contradiction]] by creating an immovable object and an unstoppable force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt;&lt;p&gt;This raises the question, similar to the [[Euthyphro Dilemma]], of where this law of logic, which God is bound to obey, comes from. According to these theologians ([[Norman Geisler]] and [[William Lane Craig]]), this law is not a law above God that he assents to but, rather, logic is an eternal part of God's nature, like his [[omniscience]] or [[omnibenevolence]].&lt;/p&gt;

===Paradox is meaningless: the question is sophistry, meaning it makes grammatical sense, but has no intelligible meaning===

Another common response is that since God is supposedly omnipotent, the phrase "could not lift" does not make sense and the paradox is meaningless.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Problem of Pain, Clive Staples Lewis, 1944 MacMillan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loving Wisdom: Christian Philosophy of Religion by Paul Copan, Chalice Press, 2007 page 46&lt;/ref&gt; This may mean that the complexity involved in rightly understanding omnipotence—contra all the logical details involved in misunderstanding it—is a function of the fact that omnipotence, like infinity, is perceived at all by contrasting reference to those complex and variable things, ''which it is not''.  An alternative meaning, however, is that a non-corporeal God cannot lift anything, but can raise it (a linguistic pedantry)—or to use the beliefs of Hindus (that there is one God, who can be manifest as several different beings) that whilst it is possible for God to do all things, it is not possible for all his incarnations to do them. As such, God could create a stone so heavy that, in one incarnation, he couldn't lift it, yet could do something that an incarnation that ''could'' lift the stone could not.

The lifting a rock paradox (''Can God lift a stone larger than he can carry?'') uses human characteristics to cover up the main skeletal structure of the question. With these assumptions made, two arguments can stem from it:

#'''Lifting''' covers up the definition of '''translation''', which means moving something from one point in space to another. With this in mind, the real question would be, "''Can God move a rock from one location in space to another that is larger than possible?''" For the rock to be unable to move from one space to another, it would have to be larger than space itself. However, it is impossible for a rock to be larger than space, as space always adjusts itself to cover the space of the rock. If the supposed rock was out of space-time dimension, then the question would not make sense—because it would be impossible to move an object from one location in space to another if there is no space to begin with, meaning the faulting is with the logic of the question and not God's capabilities.
#The words, "Lift a Stone" are used instead to substitute capability. With this in mind, essentially the question is asking if God is incapable, so the real question would be, "''Is God capable of being incapable?''" If God is capable of being incapable, it means that He is incapable, because He has the potential to not be able to do something. Conversely, if God is incapable of being incapable, then the two inabilities cancel each other out, making God have the capability to do something.

The act of killing oneself is not applicable to an omnipotent being, since, despite that such an act does involve some power, it also involves a ''lack'' of power: the human person who can kill himself is already not indestructible, and, in fact, every agent constituting his environment is more powerful in some ways than himself. In other words, all non-omnipotent agents are concretely ''synthetic'': constructed as contingencies of other, smaller, agents, meaning that they, unlike an omnipotent agent, logically can exist not only in multiple instantiation (by being constructed out of the more basic agents they are made of), but are each bound to a different location in space contra transcendent [[omnipresence]].

[[Thomas Aquinas]] asserts that the paradox arises from a misunderstanding of omnipotence. He maintains that inherent contradictions and logical impossibilities do not fall under the omnipotence of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/a/aquinas/summa/FP/FP025.html#FPQ25A3THEP1 |title=Summa Theologica |publisher=Ccel.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  J. L Cowan sees this paradox as a reason to reject the concept of 'absolute' omnipotence,&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, J. L. "The Paradox of Omnipotence" first published 1962, in ''The Power of God: Readings on Omnipotence and Evil''. Linwood Urban and Douglass Walton eds. Oxford University Press 1978 pp. 144–52&lt;/ref&gt; while others, such as [[René Descartes]], argue that God is absolutely omnipotent, despite the problem.&lt;ref name="Descartes, Rene 1641"/&gt;

[[C. S. Lewis]] argues that when talking about omnipotence, referencing "a rock so heavy that God cannot lift it" is nonsense just as much as referencing "a square circle"; that it is not logically coherent in terms of power to think that omnipotence includes the power to do the logically impossible. So asking "Can God create a rock so heavy that even he cannot lift it?" is just as much nonsense as asking "Can God draw a square circle?" The logical contradiction here being God's simultaneous ability and disability in lifting the rock: the statement "God can lift this rock" must have a truth value of either true or false, it cannot possess both. This is justified by observing that for the omnipotent agent to create such a stone, it must already be more powerful than itself: such a stone is too heavy for the omnipotent agent to lift, but the omnipotent agent already can create such a stone; If an omnipotent agent already is more powerful than itself, then it already is just that powerful. This means that its power to create a stone that’s too heavy for it to lift is identical to its power to lift that very stone. While this doesn’t quite make complete sense, Lewis wished to stress its implicit point: that even within the attempt to prove that the concept of omnipotence is immediately incoherent, one admits that it is immediately coherent, and that the only difference is that this attempt is forced to admit this despite that the attempt is constituted by a perfectly irrational route to its own unwilling end, with a perfectly irrational set of 'things' included in that end.

In other words, the 'limit' on what omnipotence 'can' do is not a ''limit'' on its actual agency, but an ''epistemological boundary'' without which omnipotence could not be ''identified'' (paradoxically or otherwise) in the first place. In fact, this process is merely a fancier form of the classic [[Liar Paradox]]: If I say, "I am a liar", then how can it be true if I am telling the truth therewith, and, if I am telling the truth therewith, then how can I be a liar? So, to think that omnipotence is an ''epistemological'' paradox is like failing to recognize that, when taking the statement, 'I am a liar' self-referentially, the statement is reduced to an actual failure to lie. In other words, if one maintains the supposedly 'initial' position that the necessary conception of omnipotence includes the 'power' to compromise both itself and all other identity, and if one concludes from this position that omnipotence is epistemologically incoherent, then one implicitly is asserting that one's own 'initial' position is incoherent. Therefore, the question (and therefore the perceived paradox) is meaningless.  Nonsense does not suddenly acquire sense and meaning with the addition of the two words, "God can" before it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Lewis additionally said that, "Unless something is self-evident, nothing can be proved." This implies for the debate on omnipotence that, ''as in matter, so in the human understanding of truth: it takes no true insight to destroy a perfectly integrated structure, and the effort to destroy has greater effect than an equal effort to build; so, a man is thought a fool who assumes its integrity, and thought an abomination who argues for it. It is easier to teach a fish to swim in outer space than to convince a room full of ignorant fools why it cannot be done.''

==Language and omnipotence==
The philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] is frequently interpreted as arguing that language is not up to the task of describing the kind of power an omnipotent being would have. In his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', he stays generally within the realm of [[logical positivism]] until claim 6.4—but at 6.41 and following, he argues that [[ethics]] and several other issues are "transcendental" subjects that we cannot examine with language. Wittgenstein also mentions the will, life after death, and God—arguing that, "When the answer cannot be put into words, neither can the question be put into words."&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein, Ludwig. proposition 6.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Wittgenstein's work expresses the omnipotence paradox as a problem in [[semantics]]—the study of how we give symbols meaning. (The retort "That's only semantics," is a way of saying that a statement only concerns the definitions of words, instead of anything important in the physical world.) According to the ''Tractatus,'' then, even attempting to formulate the omnipotence paradox is futile, since language cannot refer to the entities the paradox considers. The final proposition of the ''Tractatus'' gives Wittgenstein's dictum for these circumstances: "What we cannot speak of, we must pass over in silence".&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein, Ludwig. proposition 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Wittgenstein's approach to these problems is influential among other 20th century religious thinkers such as [[D. Z. Phillips]].&lt;ref name="phillips"&gt;[[D. Z. Phillips]] "Philosophy, Theology and the Reality of God" in Philosophy of Religion: Selected Readings. William Rowe and William Wainwright eds. 3rd ed. 1998 Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; In his later years, however, Wittgenstein wrote works often interpreted as conflicting with his positions in the ''Tractatus'',&lt;ref name="hacker"&gt;Hacker, P.M.S. Wittgenstein's Place in Twentieth-Century Analytic Philosophy. 1996 Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed the later Wittgenstein is mainly seen as the leading critic of the early Wittgenstein.

In the 6th century, [[Pseudo-Dionysius]] claims that a version of the omnipotence paradox constituted the dispute between Paul the Apostle and Elymas the Magician mentioned in [[Acts 13]]:8, but it is phrased in terms of a debate as to whether or not God can "deny himself" ala 2 Tim 2:13.&lt;ref name = "psd"&gt;[[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Pseudo-Dionysius]], "Divine Names" 893B in Pseudo-Dionysius: The Complete Works. trans Colm Luibheid Paulist Press. 1987. {{ISBN|0-8091-2838-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 11th century, [[Anselm of Canterbury]] argues that there are many things that God cannot do, but that nonetheless he counts as omnipotent.&lt;ref name="anselm"&gt;Anselm of Canterbury Proslogion Chap. VII, in The Power of God: readings on Omnipotence and Evil. Linwood Urban and Douglass Walton eds. Oxford University Press 1978 pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Aquinas]] advanced a version of the omnipotence paradox by asking whether God could create a triangle with internal angles that did not add up to 180 degrees. As Aquinas put it in [[Summa contra Gentiles]]:

{{quotation|Since the principles of certain sciences, such as logic, geometry and arithmetic are taken only from the formal principles of things, on which the essence of the thing depends, it follows that God could not make things contrary to these principles. For example, that a genus was not predicable of the species, or that lines drawn from the centre to the circumference were not equal, or that a triangle did not have three angles equal to two right angles.&lt;ref&gt;"Cum principia quarundam scientiarum, ut logicae, geometriae et arithmeticae, sumantur ex solis principiis formalibus rerum, ex quibus essentia rei dependet, sequitur quod contraria horum principiorum Deus facere non possit: sicut quod genus non sit praedicabile de specie; vel quod lineae ductae a centro ad circumferentiam non sint aequales; aut quod triangulus rectilineus non habeat tres angulos aequales duobus rectis". Aquinas, T. ''Summa Contra Gentiles'', Book 2, Section 25. trans. Edward Buckner&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This can be done on a sphere, and not on a flat surface. The later invention of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] does not resolve this question; for one might as well ask, "If given the axioms of [[elliptic geometry|Riemannian geometry]], can an omnipotent being create a triangle whose angles ''do not'' add up to ''more'' than 180 degrees?" In either case, the real question is whether or not an omnipotent being would have the ability to evade consequences that follow logically from a system of axioms that the being created.

A version of the paradox can also be seen in non-theological contexts. A similar problem occurs when accessing legislative or [[parliamentary sovereignty]], which holds a specific legal institution to be omnipotent in legal power, and in particular such an institution's ability to regulate itself.&lt;ref&gt;Suber, P. (1990) [http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/psa/sec01.htm#C ''The Paradox of Self-Amendment: A Study of Law, Logic, Omnipotence, and Change'']. Peter Lang Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

In a sense, the classic statement of the omnipotence paradox — a rock so heavy that its omnipotent creator cannot lift it — is grounded in [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] science. After all, if we consider the stone's position relative to the sun the planet orbits around, one could hold that the stone is ''constantly'' lifted—strained though that interpretation would be in the present context. Modern physics indicates that the choice of phrasing about lifting stones should relate to acceleration; however, this does not in itself of course invalidate the fundamental concept of the generalized omnipotence paradox. However, one could easily modify the classic statement as follows: "An omnipotent being creates a [[universe]] that follows the laws of Aristotelian physics. Within this universe, can the omnipotent being create a stone so heavy that the being cannot lift it?"

[[Ethan Allen]]'s ''Reason'' addresses the topics of [[original sin]], [[theodicy]] and several others in classic [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] fashion.&lt;ref name = "allen"&gt;[[Ethan Allen|Allen, Ethan]]. [http://libertyonline.hypermall.com/allen-reason.html ''Reason: The Only Oracle of Man.''] J.P. Mendum, Cornill; 1854. Originally published 1784. (Accessed on 19 April 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; In Chapter 3, section IV, he notes that "omnipotence itself" could not exempt animal life from mortality, since change and death are defining attributes of such life. He argues, "the one cannot be without the other, any more than there could be a compact number of mountains without valleys, or that I could exist and not exist at the same time, or that God should effect any other contradiction in nature." Labeled by his friends a [[Deism|Deist]], Allen accepted the notion of a divine being, though throughout ''Reason'' he argues that even a divine being must be circumscribed by logic.

In ''[[Principles of Philosophy]],'' [[Descartes]] tried refuting the existence of atoms with a variation of this argument, claiming God could not create things so indivisible that he could not divide them.

The '''pantheism controversy''' ({{lang-de|Pantheismusstreit}}) was an event in German cultural history that lasted between 1785–1789 which had an effect throughout Europe.

==History==
A conversation between the German philosopher [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]] and the German dramatist [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] in 1780 led Jacobi to a protracted study of [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s works. Lessing had avowed that he knew no philosophy, in the true sense of that word, save [[Spinozism]].

Jacobi's ''Über die Lehre des Spinozas'' (1st ed. 1785, 2nd ed. 1789) expressed sharply and clearly his strenuous objection to a dogmatic system in philosophy, and drew upon him the vigorous enmity of the [[Berlin, Germany|Berlin]] group, led by [[Moses Mendelssohn]]. Jacobi claimed that Spinoza's doctrine was pure [[materialism]], because all Nature and God are said to be nothing but extended [[Substance theory|substance]]. This, for Jacobi, was the result of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[rationalism]] and it would finally end in absolute [[atheism]]. Mendelssohn disagreed with Jacobi, saying that there is no actual difference between [[theism]] and [[pantheism]]. The entire issue became a major intellectual and religious concern for European civilization at the time, which [[Immanuel Kant]] rejected, as he thought that attempts to conceive of transcendent reality would lead to [[antinomy|antinomies]] in thought.

Jacobi was ridiculed for trying to reintroduce into philosophy the antiquated notion of unreasoning belief, was denounced as an enemy of reason, as a [[pietist]], and as a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] in disguise, and was especially attacked for his use of the ambiguous term ''Glaube'' ([[German (language)|German]]: "belief, faith"). 

Willi Goetschel argues that Jacobi's publication significantly shaped the reception of Spinoza's doctrine for centuries following its publication, obscuring the nuance of Spinoza's philosophic work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goetschel|first1=Willi|title=Spinoza's Modernity: Mendelssohn, Lessing, and Heine|date=2004|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison, Wisconsin|isbn=0299190803|pages=12-13|ref=Goetschel2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pantheism controversy is also notable for its development of and influence upon prominent philosophical terms in German culture, including the idea of [[nihilism]] and claims that [[God is dead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 74 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobi's next important work, ''[[David Hume]] Über den Glauben, oder Idealismus und Realismus'' (1787), was an attempt to show not only that the term ''Glaube'' had been used by the most eminent writers to denote what he had employed it for in the ''Letters on Spinoza'', but that the nature of the cognition of facts as opposed to the construction of inferences could not be otherwise expressed. In this writing, and especially in the appendix, Jacobi came into contact with the [[critical philosophy]], and subjected the Kantian view of knowledge to searching examination.

The attraction of Spinoza's philosophy to late eighteenth-century Europeans was that it provided an alternative to materialism, atheism, and [[deism]]. Three of Spinoza's ideas strongly appealed to them:
*the unity of all that exists;
*the regularity of all that happens; and
*the identity of spirit and nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lange|first1=Frederick Albert|title=History of Materialism and Criticism of its Present Importance, Vol. II|date=1880|publisher=Houghton, Osgood, &amp; Co.|location=Boston|page=147|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofmateria02lang|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4153">[[File:Bernhardt Hamlet2.jpg|thumb| The paradox of fiction asks why we experience strong emotions when, for example,  we are watching [[Hamlet]] on stage while at the same time knowing that it is not really Hamlet but merely an [[actor]].]]

The '''paradox of fiction''' is a [[Philosophy|philosophical]] problem about how people can experience strong [[Aesthetic emotions|emotions]] from purely [[fiction]]al things, such as art, literature, and imagination. The [[paradox]] draws attention to an everyday issue of how people are moved by things which, in some ways, do not exist. Although the [[ontology]] of fictional things in general has been discussed in philosophy since [[Plato]],&lt;ref name=paskow2004&gt;{{cite book|last=Paskow|first=Alan|title=The Paradoxes of Art : A phenomenological investigation|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-82833-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the paradox was first suggested by [[Colin Radford]] and Michael Weston in 1975.&lt;ref name=radwest1975&gt;{{cite journal|last=Radford|first=Colin|author2=Weston, Michael|title=How can we be moved by the fate of Anna Karenina?|journal=Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Supplementary Volumes|date=January 1975|volume=49|pages=67–93|jstor=4106870}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Radford and Weston's original paper, they and others have continued the discussion by giving the problem slightly differing formulations and solutions.&lt;ref name="iep2012"&gt;{{cite web|last = Schneider|first = Steven|title = The Paradox of Fiction|url = http://www.iep.utm.edu/fict-par/|publisher = Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate = 27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The paradox ==
The basic paradox is as follows:&lt;ref name="paskow2004" /&gt;

# Most people have emotional responses to characters, objects, events etc. which they know to be fictitious.
# On the other hand, in order for us to be emotionally moved, we must believe that these characters, objects, or events, truly exist.
# But no person who takes characters or events to be fictional at the same time believes that they are real.

The paradox is that all three premises seem to be true, but can not logically be true at the same time. If any two points (e.g. 1 and 3) are taken to be true, then the third (e.g. 2) must either be false or else produce a contradiction.

==Proposed solutions==
The various proposed solutions to the paradox can be divided into three basic groups:&lt;ref name="paskow2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="iep2012" /&gt;

* The ''pretend'' or the ''simulation theories'', proposed for example by [[Kendall Walton]].
:The pretend theories deny premise 1 and argue that with fiction we do not experience real emotions but rather something less intense. For example, when watching a horror movie where the monster makes an attack towards the viewer (towards the camera), the viewer can be startled but does not truly fear for his or her life.
* The ''thought theories'', for example from [[Peter Lamarque]], [[Noël Carroll]], and Robert J. Yanal.
:The thought theories deny premise 2 and claim that we can have genuine emotions from things even if we do not believe them to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/philosophy-articles-friday-phil-colin-radford-paradox-of-fiction/|title = Why Stories Make Us Feel: Colin Radford’s So-called "Paradox of Fiction" and How Art Prompts Human Emotion|date = November 13, 2015|access-date = February 22, 2016|website = The Gemsbok|publisher = |last = Podgorski|first = Daniel|series = Your Friday Phil}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''illusion'' or ''realist theories'', for example from Alan Paskow.
:The illusion theories deny premise 3 and claim that, in a way, the fictional characters are real. They suggest that [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] was right saying that fiction involves a ''[[Suspension of disbelief|"willing suspension of disbelief"]]'', i.e. believing in the fiction while engaging with it.

== Introduction ==

=== Knowledge ===
Traditionally, the term "philosophy" referred to any body of [[knowledge]].&lt;ref name="auto23"/&gt;&lt;ref name="etymonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=philosophy|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, philosophy is closely related to religion, mathematics, natural science, education and politics. Newton's 1687 "[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy]]" is classified in the 2000s as a book of physics; he used the term  "[[natural philosophy]]" because it used to encompass disciplines that later became associated with sciences such as [[astronomy]], [[medicine]] and [[physics]].{{sfn|Lindberg|2007|p=3}}

In the first part of the first book of his ''Academics'', [[Cicero]] introduced the division of philosophy into logic, physics, and ethics; in section thirteen of the first book of his [[Lives_and_Opinions_of_Eminent_Philosophers|''Lives and Opinions of the Eminent Philosophers'']], the 3rd-century [[Diogenes_Laërtius|Diogenes Laërtius]], the first historian of philosophy, established the traditional division of philosophical inquiry into three parts: 

* [[Science|Natural philosophy]] ("physics," from ''ta physika'', "things having to do with nature (''physis'')" was the study of the constitution and processes of transformation in the physical world;
* [[Ethics|Moral philosophy]] ("ethics," from ''êthika,'' literally, "having to do with character, disposition, manners") was the study of goodness, right and wrong, justice and virtue.
* [[Metaphysics|Metaphysical philosophy]] ("logic") was the study of [[existence]], causation, [[God]], [[logic]], [[Universal (metaphysics)|forms]] and other abstract objects ("''meta ta physika"'' lit: "After [the book] the Physics").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kant: Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|date=2012|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=YASbAEhCLw0C}}|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107401068|edition=2nd|quote="Ancient Greek philosophy was divided into three branches of knowledge: natural science, ethics, and logic."}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This division is not obsolete but has changed. Natural philosophy has split into the various natural sciences, especially astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, and cosmology. Moral philosophy has birthed the social sciences, but still includes value theory (including aesthetics, ethics, political philosophy, etc.). Metaphysical philosophy has birthed formal sciences such as logic, mathematics and philosophy of science, but still includes epistemology, cosmology and others.

=== Philosophical progress ===

[[Colin McGinn]] and others claim that no [[philosophical progress]] has occurred during that interval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Problems in Philosophy: The Limits of Inquiry|last=McGinn|first=Colin|date=1993|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=o_xMMPWzIecC}}|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-55786-475-8|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Chalmers|Chalmers]] and others, by contrast, see progress in philosophy similar to that in science,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sms.cam.ac.uk/media/1484158|title=Video &amp; Audio: Why isn't there more progress in philosophy? – Metadata|website=www.sms.cam.ac.uk|access-date=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Talbot Brewer argued that "progress" is the wrong standard by which to judge philosophical activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Retrieval of Ethics|last=Brewer|first=Talbot|date=2011|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=d15rGnw_6rUC}}|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-969222-4|edition=1st|location=Oxford; New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|History}}Historical overview&lt;!--'History of philosophy' redirects here--&gt; ==
In one general sense, philosophy is associated with wisdom, intellectual culture and a search for knowledge. In that sense, all cultures and literate societies ask philosophical questions such as "how are we to live" and "what is the nature of reality". A broad and impartial conception of philosophy then, finds a reasoned inquiry into such matters as reality, morality and life in all world civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;Garfield  (Editor), Edelglass (Editor), ''The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy'', Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Western philosophy]] is the philosophical tradition of the [[Western world]] and dates to [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Pre-Socratic]] thinkers who were active in [[Ancient Greece]] in the 6th century BCE such as [[Thales]] (c. 624–546 BCE) and [[Pythagoras]] (c. 570–495 BCE) who practiced a "love of wisdom" (''philosophia'')&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=b_VvghYDArwC}}|title=Lectures on the History of Philosophy: Greek philosophy|last=Hegel|first=Georg Wilhelm Friedrich|last2=Brown|first2=Robert F.|date=2006|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-927906-7|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were also termed ''physiologoi'' (students of ''physis'', or nature). [[Socrates]] was a very influential philosopher, who insisted that he possessed no ''wisdom'' but was a ''pursuer of'' wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DSym.%3Asection%3D201d|title=Plato's "Symposium"|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|page=201d and following|access-date=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Western philosophy]] can be divided into three eras: [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient]] (Greco-Roman), [[Medieval philosophy]] (Christian European), and [[Modern philosophy]].

The Ancient era was dominated by [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophical schools]] which arose out of the various pupils of Socrates, such as [[Plato]], who founded the [[Platonic Academy]] and his student [[Aristotle]],&lt;ref name="process"/&gt; founding the [[Peripatetic school]], who were both extremely influential in Western tradition. Other traditions include [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynicism]], [[Stoicism]], [[Skepticism#Philosophical skepticism|Greek Skepticism]] and [[Epicureanism]]. Important topics covered by the Greeks included [[metaphysics]] (with competing theories such as [[atomism]] and [[monism]]), [[cosmology]], the nature of the well-lived life ([[eudaimonia]]), the possibility of knowledge and the nature of reason ([[logos]]). With the rise of the [[Roman empire]], Greek philosophy was also increasingly discussed in [[Latin language|Latin]] by [[Romans]] such as [[Cicero]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]].

[[Medieval philosophy]] (5th – 16th century) is the period following the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] and was dominated by the rise of [[Christianity]] and hence reflects [[Judeo-Christian]] theological concerns as well as retaining a continuity with Greco-Roman thought. Problems such as the existence and nature of [[God]], the nature of [[faith]] and reason, metaphysics, the [[problem of evil]] were discussed in this period. Some key Medieval thinkers include [[St. Augustine]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Boethius]], [[Anselm of Laon|Anselm]] and [[Roger Bacon]]. Philosophy for these thinkers was viewed as an aid to [[Theology]] (''ancilla theologiae'') and hence they sought to align their philosophy with their interpretation of sacred scripture. This period saw the development of [[Scholasticism]], a text critical method developed in [[medieval universities]] based on close reading and disputation on key texts. The [[Renaissance]] period saw increasing focus on classic Greco-Roman thought and on a robust [[Humanism]].
[[Early modern philosophy]] in the Western world begins with thinkers such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650).&lt;ref name="diane"&gt;{{cite book|title=Fifty Major Philosophers, A Reference Guide|page=125|author=Diane Collinson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the rise of natural science, [[Modern philosophy]] was concerned with developing a secular and rational foundation for knowledge and moved away from traditional structures of authority such as religion, scholastic thought and the Church. Major modern philosophers include [[Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[David Hume|Hume]], and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].&lt;ref name="philosophical12"&gt;Rutherford, ''The Cambridge Companion to Early Modern Philosophy'', p. 1: "Most often this [period] has been associated with the achievements of a handful of great thinkers: the so-called 'rationalists' (Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz) and 'empiricists' (Locke, Berkeley, Hume), whose inquiries culminate in Kant's 'Critical philosophy.' These canonical figures have been celebrated for the depth and rigor of their treatments of perennial philosophical questions..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="traditional"&gt;Nadler, ''A Companion to Early Modern Philosophy'', p. 2: "The study of early modern philosophy demands that we pay attention to a wide variety of questions and an expansive pantheon of thinkers: the traditional canonical figures (Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume), to be sure, but also a large 'supporting cast'..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="philosophical13"&gt;[[Bruce Kuklick]], "Seven Thinkers and How They Grew: Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz; Locke, Berkeley, Hume; Kant" in Rorty, Schneewind, and Skinner (eds.), ''Philosophy in History'' (Cambridge University Press, 1984), p. 125: "Literary, philosophical, and historical studies often rely on a notion of what is ''canonical''. In American philosophy scholars go from Jonathan Edwards to John Dewey; in American literature from James Fenimore Cooper to F. Scott Fitzgerald; in political theory from Plato to Hobbes and Locke […] The texts or authors who fill in the blanks from A to Z in these, and other intellectual traditions, constitute the canon, and there is an accompanying narrative that links text to text or author to author, a 'history of' American literature, economic thought, and so on. The most conventional of such histories are embodied in university courses and the textbooks that accompany them. This essay examines one such course, the History of Modern Philosophy, and the texts that helped to create it. If a philosopher in the United States were asked why the seven people in my title comprise Modern Philosophy, the initial response would be: they were the best, and there are historical and philosophical connections among them."&lt;/ref&gt; [[19th-century philosophy]] is influenced by the wider movement termed [[the Enlightenment]], and includes figures such as [[Hegel]] a key figure in [[German idealism]], [[Kierkegaard]] who developed the foundations for [[existentialism]], [[Nietzsche]] a famed anti-Christian, [[J.S. Mill]] who promoted [[Utilitarianism]], [[Karl Marx]] who developed the foundations for [[Communism]] and the American [[William James]]. The 20th century saw the split between [[Analytic philosophy]] and [[Continental philosophy]], as well as philosophical trends such as [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]], [[Existentialism]], [[Logical Positivism]], [[Pragmatism]] and the [[Linguistic turn]].

===Middle Eastern philosophy===
[[File:Avicenna Portrait on Silver Vase - Museum at BuAli Sina (Avicenna) Mausoleum - Hamadan - Western Iran (7423560860).jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.7|Avicenna Portrait on Silver Vase, Iran]]

{{See also|Islamic philosophy|Middle Eastern philosophy}}
The regions of the [[fertile Crescent]], [[Iran]] and [[Arabia]] are home to the earliest known philosophical [[Wisdom literature]] and is today mostly dominated by [[Islamic culture]]. Early wisdom literature from the fertile crescent was a genre which sought to instruct people on ethical action, practical living and virtue through stories and proverbs. In [[Ancient Egypt]], these texts were known as [[sebayt]] ('teachings') and they are central to our understandings of [[Ancient Egyptian philosophy]]. [[Babylonian astronomy]] also included much philosophical speculations about cosmology which may have influenced the Ancient Greeks. [[Jewish philosophy]] and [[Christian philosophy]] are religio-philosophical traditions that developed both in the Middle East and in Europe, which both share certain early Judaic texts (mainly the [[Tanakh]]) and monotheistic beliefs. Jewish thinkers such as the [[Geonim]] of the [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia]] and [[Maimonides]] engaged with Greek and Islamic philosophy. Later Jewish philosophy came under strong Western intellectual influences and includes the works of [[Moses Mendelssohn]] who ushered in the [[Haskalah]] (the Jewish Enlightenment), [[Jewish existentialism]] and [[Reform Judaism]].

Pre-Islamic [[Iranian philosophy]] begins with the work of [[Zoroaster]], one of the first promoters of [[monotheism]] and of the [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] between good and evil. This dualistic cosmogony influenced later Iranian developments such as [[Manichaeism]], [[Mazdakism]], and [[Zurvanism]].

After the [[Muslim conquests]], [[Early Islamic philosophy]] developed the Greek philosophical traditions in new innovative directions. This [[Islamic Golden Age]] influenced European intellectual developments. The two main currents of early Islamic thought are [[Kalam]] which focuses on [[Islamic theology]] and [[#Falsafa|Falsafa]] which was based on [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Neoplatonism]]. The work of Aristotle was very influential among the falsafa such as [[al-Kindi]] (9th century), [[Avicenna]] (980 – June 1037) and [[Averroes]] (12th century). Others such as [[Al-Ghazali]] were highly critical of the methods of the Aristotelian falsafa. Islamic thinkers also developed a [[scientific method]], experimental medicine, a theory of optics and a legal philosophy. [[Ibn Khaldun]] was an influential thinker in [[philosophy of history]].

In [[History of Iran|Iran]] several schools of Islamic philosophy continued to flourish after the Golden Age and include currents such as [[Illuminationist philosophy]], [[Sufi philosophy]], and [[Transcendent theosophy]]. The 19th- and 20th-century [[Arab world]] saw the [[Al-Nahda|Nahda]] (awakening or renaissance) movement which influenced [[contemporary Islamic philosophy]].

===Indian philosophy===
{{Main|Eastern philosophy|Indian philosophy}}
[[Indian philosophy]] ({{lang-sa|{{IAST|darśana}}}}; 'world views', 'teachings')&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=darzana&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 Soken Sanskrit, ''darzana'']&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the diverse philosophical traditions that emerged since the ancient times on the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Jainism and Buddhism originated at the end of the Vedic period, while Hinduism emerged as a fusion of diverse traditons, starting after the end of the Vedic period.

Hindus generally classify these traditions as either orthodox or heterodox – [[Āstika and nāstika|āstika or nāstika]] – depending on whether they accept the authority of the [[Vedas]] and the theories of [[Brahman]] and [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (soul, self) therein.&lt;ref&gt;John Bowker, ''Oxford Dictionary of World Religions'', p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger |title=On Hinduism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c8vRAgAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-936008-6|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The orthodox schools include the Hindu traditions of thought, while the heterodox schools include the Buddhist and the Jain traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Karl Potter| title=A Fresh Classification of India’s Philosophical Systems|journal = Journal of Asian Studies|volume=21| issue=1|year=1961| pages=25-32|jstor=2050985}}, Quote: "Whatever the source of the generally accepted classification of Indian philosophical systems, its six divisions do not appear to most scholars in this field to stem from logic. As a systematic attempt to deal with theoretical problems of metaphysics, logic, epistemology, and related topics, the “six systems” account has several glaring deficiencies. Two of these will be mentioned briefly. [...] A second deficiency in the “six-system” account is that it only covers orthodox philosophers, i.e., the Hindu schools of thought. From a philosophical standpoint, the views of the Buddhists and Jains are equally important."&lt;/ref&gt; Other schools include the [[Ajñana]], [[Ajivika]] and [[Cārvāka]] which became extinct over their history.&lt;ref name=andrewoverview&gt;Andrew Nicholson (2013), Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231149877}}, pages 2-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bilimoriaastika&gt;P Bilimoria (2000), Indian Philosophy (Editor: Roy Perrett), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1135703226}}, page 88&lt;/ref&gt; 

Important Indian philosophical concepts shared by the Indian philosophies include [[dharma]], [[karma]], [[artha]], [[kama]], [[dukkha]] (suffering), [[anitya]] (anicca, impermanence), [[meditation|dhyana]] (jhana, meditation), renunciation (with or without monasticism or asceticism), various [[samsara]] with cycles of rebirth, [[moksha]] (nirvana, kaivalya, liberation from rebirth), and virtues such as [[ahimsa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William A.

{{Main|Jain philosophy}}
Jain philosophy accepts the concept of a permanent soul (jiva) as one of the five ''astikayas'', or eternal infinite categories that make up the substance of existence. The other four being ''dharma'', ''adharma'', ''akasha'' (space) and ''pudgala'' (matter). The Jain thought separates matter from the soul completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/dravya|title=dravya – Jainism|website=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has two major subtraditions: Digambara (sky dressed, naked) and Svetambara (white dressed), along with several more minor traditions such as Terapanthis.&lt;ref name="Dundas2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Dundas|authorlink=Paul Dundas|title=The Jains|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jt6-YXE2aUwC|year=2002 |publisher=Psychology Press|isbn= 978-0-415-26606-2|pages=2–3, 45–49, 260–261}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Asceticism]] is a major monastic virtue in Jainism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Dundas|authorlink=Paul Dundas|title=The Jains|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jt6-YXE2aUwC|year=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-26606-2|pages=163–174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jain texts such as the ''[[Tattvartha Sutra]]'' state that right faith, right knowledge and right conduct is the path to liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Natubhai Shah|title=Jainism: The World of Conquerors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qLNQKGcDIhsC&amp;pg=PA90|year=2004|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1938-2|pages=90–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has two major subtraditions: Digambara and Svetambara, along with several more minor traditions such as Terapanthis.

====Buddhist philosophy====
{{Main|Buddhist philosophy|Buddhist ethics}}
[[File:Monks debating at Sera monastery, 2013.webm|thumb|Monks debating at [[Sera monastery]], Tibet, 2013.]]
[[Buddhist philosophy]] begins with the thought of [[Gautama Buddha]] (fl. between sixth and fourth centuries BCE) and is preserved in the [[Buddhist texts#Texts of the Early schools|early Buddhist texts]]. It originated in India and later spread to [[East Asia]], [[Tibet]], [[Central Asia]], and [[Southeast Asia]], developing syncretic traditions in these regions. The Buddhist philosophy is traditionally classified into four schools, states Karl Potter – the editor of ''The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies''. These are the Vaibhasika, Sautrantika, Yogacara (or Vijnanavada), and Madhyamika schools. They contributed to the two major surviving traditions of Buddhism, the Mahayana and the Theravada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Karl Potter| title=A Fresh Classification of India’s Philosophical Systems|journal = Journal of Asian Studies|volume=21| issue=1|year=1961| pages=25-32|jstor=2050985}}, Quote: "Within Buddhist philosophy there is also a traditional classification into four schools — Vaibhasika, Sautrantika, Yogacara (or Vijnanavada), and Madhyamika."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mahayana form of Buddhist thought is the dominant philosophical tradition in East Asian regions such as [[China]], [[South Korea|Korea]] and [[Japan]]. The Theravada form is dominant in Southeast Asian countries such as [[Sri Lanka]], [[Burma]] and [[Thailand]]. Buddhist philosophy incorporates epistemology, metaphysics, ethics and psychology to end rebirth and associated [[dukkha]]. Key innovative concepts include the [[Four Noble Truths]], [[Anatta]] (not-self), [[Anicca]] (impermanence).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Gombrich|title=Theravada Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZyJAgAAQBAJ| year=2006| publisher=Routledge| isbn=978-1-134-90352-8|page=47}}, '''Quote:''' "All phenomenal existence [in Buddhism] is said to have three interlocking characteristics: impermanence, suffering and lack of soul or essence."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert E. Buswell Jr.|author2=Donald S. Lopez Jr.|title=The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DXN2AAAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-4805-8|pages=42–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later Buddhist philosophical traditions developed complex phenomenological psychologies termed '[[Abhidharma]]'. [[Mahayana]] philosophers such as [[Nagarjuna]] and [[Vasubandhu]] developed the theories of [[Shunyata]] (emptiness of all phenomena) and Vijnapti-matra (appearance only), a form of phenomenology or [[transcendental idealism]]. The [[Dignāga]] school of [[Pramāṇa]] promoted a complex form of [[epistemology]] and [[Buddhist logic]]. After the disappearance of Buddhism from India, these philosophical traditions continued to develop in the [[Tibetan Buddhist]], [[East Asian Buddhist]] and [[Theravada Buddhist]] traditions.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The six are listed in three pairs: Samkhya-Yoga, Vedanta-Mimamsa, Nyaya-Vaisheshika."&lt;/ref&gt; The Vedas as a knowledge source were interpreted differently by these six schools of Hindu philosophy, with varying degrees of overlap. They represent a "collection of philosophical views that share a textual connection", according to Chadha.&lt;ref&gt;M Chadha (2015), The Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Philosophy of Religion (Editor: Graham Oppy), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1844658312}}, pages 127-128&lt;/ref&gt; They also reflect a tolerance for a diversity of philosophical interpretations within Hinduism while sharing the same foundation.&lt;ref name="Sharma1990p1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind Sharma|title=A Hindu Perspective on the Philosophy of Religion|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jKewCwAAQBAJ|year=1990|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-349-20797-8|pages=1–2}}, Quote: "The attitude towards the existence of God varies within the Hindu religious tradition.

Some of the earliest surviving Hindu mystical and philosophical texts are the [[Upanishads]] of the [[Vedic period#Later Vedic period (1000–500 BCE)|later Vedic period]] (1000–500 BCE). Hindu philosophers of the six schools developed systems of epistemology ([[pramana]]) and investigated topics such as metaphysics, ethics, psychology (''guna''), [[hermeneutics]] and [[soteriology]] within the framework of the Vedic knowledge, while presenting a diverse collection of interpretations.&lt;ref name=frazierintrop2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frazier|first1=Jessica|title=The Continuum companion to Hindu studies | date=2011|publisher=Continuum| location=London|isbn=978-0-8264-9966-0|pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carl Olson (2007), The Many Colors of Hinduism: A Thematic-historical Introduction, Rutgers University Press, {{ISBN|978-0813540689}}, pages 101-119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliott Deutsche (2000), in Philosophy of Religion : Indian Philosophy Vol 4 (Editor: Roy Perrett), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0815336112}}, pages 245-248;&lt;br&gt;John A.

A similar modern Sinhalese perspective has been expressed by Walpola Rahula: "Buddhism stands unique in the history of human thought in denying the existence of such a Soul, Self or Ātman." The "no Self" or "no soul" doctrine (Sanskrit: anātman; Pāli: anattan) is particularly notable for its widespread acceptance and historical endurance. It was a standard belief of virtually all the ancient schools of Indian Buddhism (the notable exception being the Pudgalavādins), and has persisted without change into the modern era. [...] both views are mirrored by the modern Theravādin perspective of Mahasi Sayadaw that "there is no person or soul" and the modern Mahāyāna view of the fourteenth Dalai Lama that "[t]he Buddha taught that … our belief in an independent self is the root cause of all suffering".&lt;/ref&gt; and is based on the teachings and enlightenment of [[Gautama Buddha]].

East Asian philosophical thought began in [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]], and [[Chinese philosophy]] begins during the [[Western Zhou]] Dynasty and the following periods after its fall when the "[[Hundred Schools of Thought]]" flourished (6th century to 221 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Garfield  (Editor), Edelglass (Editor); ''The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy'', Chinese philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pe"&gt;{{cite book|last= Ebrey |first=Patricia|year=2010 |page= 42|title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of China|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period was characterized by significant intellectual and cultural developments and saw the rise of the major philosophical schools of China, [[Confucianism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], and [[Daoism]] as well as numerous other less influential schools. These philosophical traditions developed metaphysical, political and ethical theories such  [[Tao]], [[Yin and yang]], [[Ren (Confucianism)|Ren]] and [[Li (Confucianism)|Li]] which, along with [[Chinese Buddhism]], directly influenced [[Korean philosophy]], [[Vietnamese philosophy]] and [[Japanese philosophy]] (which also includes the native [[Shinto]] tradition). Buddhism began arriving in China during the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BCE–220 CE), through a [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism|gradual Silk road transmission]] and through native influences developed distinct Chinese forms (such as Chan/[[Zen]]) which spread throughout the [[East Asian cultural sphere]]. During later Chinese dynasties like the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368–1644) as well as in the Korean [[Joseon dynasty]] (1392–1897) a resurgent [[Neo-Confucianism]] led by thinkers such as [[Wang Yangming]] (1472–1529) became the dominant school of thought, and was promoted by the imperial state.

In the Modern era, Chinese thinkers incorporated ideas from Western philosophy. [[Chinese Marxist philosophy]] developed under the influence of [[Mao Zedong]], while a Chinese pragmatism under [[Hu Shih]] and [[New Confucianism]]'s rise was influenced by [[Xiong Shili]]. Modern Japanese thought meanwhile developed under strong Western influences such as the study of Western Sciences ([[Rangaku]]) and the modernist [[Meirokusha]] intellectual society which drew from European enlightenment thought. The 20th century saw the rise of [[State Shinto]] and also [[Statism in Shōwa Japan|Japanese nationalism]]. The [[Kyoto School]], an influential and unique Japanese philosophical school developed from Western phenomenology and Medieval Japanese Buddhist philosophy such as that of [[Dogen]].

===African philosophy===
{{Main|African philosophy}}
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Frantz Fanon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Frantz Fanon]].]] --&gt;
African philosophy is philosophy produced by [[African people]], philosophy that presents African worldviews, ideas and themes, or philosophy that uses distinct African philosophical methods. Modern African thought has been occupied with [[Ethnophilosophy]], with defining the very meaning of African philosophy and its unique characteristics and what it means to be [[African people|African]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce B. Janz, Philosophy in an African Place (2009), pp. 74–79, Plymouth, UK: Lexington Books, https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0739136682&lt;/ref&gt; During the 17th century, [[Ethiopian philosophy]] developed a robust literary tradition as exemplified by [[Zera Yacob (philosopher)|Zera Yacob]]. Another early African philosopher was [[Anton Wilhelm Amo]] (c. 1703–1759) who became a respected philosopher in Germany. Distinct African philosophical ideas include [[Ujamaa]], the Bantu idea of [[Bantu Philosophy|'Force']], [[Négritude]], [[Pan-Africanism]] and [[Ubuntu (philosophy)|Ubuntu]]. Contemporary African thought has also seen the development of Professional philosophy and of [[Africana philosophy]], the philosophical literature of the [[African diaspora]] which includes currents such as [[black existentialism]] by [[African-Americans]]. Modern African thinkers have been influenced by [[Marxism]], [[African-American literature]], [[Critical theory]], [[Critical race theory]], [[Postcolonialism]] and [[Feminism]].

===Indigenous American philosophy===
{{Main|Indigenous American philosophy}}
[[File:1479 Stein der fünften Sonne, sog. Aztekenkalender, Ollin Tonatiuh anagoria.JPG|thumb|The Aztec [[Aztec calendar stone|Sun Stone]], also known as the Aztec Calendar Stone, at [[National Museum of Anthropology]], [[Mexico City]].]]
Indigenous American philosophy is the philosophy of the [[Indigenous people of the Americas]]. There is a wide variety of beliefs and traditions among these different American cultures. Among some of the [[Native Americans in the United States]] there is a belief in a metaphysical principle called the "Great Mystery" ([[Siouan]]: [[Wakan Tanka]], [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]: [[Gitche Manitou]]). Another widely shared concept was that of [[Orenda]] or "spiritual power". According to Peter M. Whiteley, for the Native Americans, "Mind is critically informed by transcendental experience (dreams, visions and so on) as well as by reason."&lt;ref name="rep.routledge.com"&gt;Whiteley; Native American philosophy, https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/native-american-philosophy/v-1&lt;/ref&gt; The practices to access these transcendental experiences are termed [[Shamanism]]. Another feature of the indigenous American worldviews was their extension of ethics to non-human animals and plants.&lt;ref name="rep.routledge.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierotti, Raymond; Communities as both Ecological and Social entities in Native American thought, http://www.se.edu/nas/files/2013/03/5thNAScommunities.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mesoamerica]], [[Aztec philosophy]] was an intellectual tradition developed by individuals called [[Tlamatini]] ('those who know something') &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OI9J7R-R1awC&amp;q=120#v=onepage&amp;q=Tlamatini&amp;f=false |title=Use of "Tlamatini" in ''Aztec Thought and Culture: A Study of the Ancient Nahuatl Mind – Miguel León Portilla'' |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its ideas are preserved in various [[Aztec codices]]. The Aztec worldview posited the concept of an ultimate universal energy or force called [[Ometeotl]] which can be translated as "Dual Cosmic Energy" and sought a way to live in balance with a constantly changing, "slippery" world. The theory of Teotl can be seen as a form of [[Pantheism]].&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"&gt;IEP, Aztec Philosophy, http://www.iep.utm.edu/aztec/&lt;/ref&gt; Aztec philosophers developed theories of metaphysics, epistemology, values, and aesthetics. Aztec ethics was focused on seeking ''tlamatiliztli'' (knowledge, wisdom) which was based on moderation and balance in all actions as in the Nahua proverb "the middle good is necessary".&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"/&gt;

The [[Inca civilization]] also had an elite class of philosopher-scholars termed the Amawtakuna who were important in the [[Inca education]] system as teachers of religion, tradition, history and ethics. Key concepts of Andean thought are [[Yanantin]] and [[Yanantin#Masintin|Masintin]] which involve a theory of “complementary opposites” that sees polarities (such as male/female, dark/light) as interdependent parts of a harmonious whole.&lt;ref&gt;Webb, Hillary S.; Yanantin and Masintin in the Andean World: Complementary Dualism in Modern Peru Hardcover – March 15, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Categories ==
Philosophical questions can be grouped into categories. These groupings allow philosophers to focus on a set of similar topics and interact with other thinkers who are interested in the same questions. The groupings also make philosophy easier for students to approach. Students can learn the basic principles involved in one aspect of the field without being overwhelmed with the entire set of philosophical theories.

Various sources present different categorical schemes. The categories adopted in this article aim for breadth and simplicity.

These five major branches can be separated into sub-branches and each sub-branch contains many specific fields of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consc.net/taxonomy.html|title=A Taxonomy of Philosophy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]]
* [[Value theory]]
* Science, [[logic]] and mathematics
* History of Western philosophy{{sfn|Kenny|2012}}
* Philosophical traditions

These divisions are neither exhaustive, nor mutually exclusive. (A philosopher might specialize in [[Kant]]ian epistemology, or [[Plato]]nic aesthetics, or modern political philosophy.) Furthermore, these philosophical inquiries sometimes overlap with each other and with other inquiries such as science, religion or mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/religion-science/|title=Religion and Science|last=Plantinga|first=Alvin|date=2014|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metaphysics ===
{{Main|Metaphysics}}

Metaphysics is the study of the most general features of [[reality]], such as [[existence]], [[time]], [[Object (philosophy)|objects]] and their [[Property (philosophy)|properties]], wholes and their parts, events, processes and [[Causality|causation]] and the relationship between [[mind]] and [[Human body|body]]. Metaphysics includes [[cosmology]], the study of the [[world]] in its entirety and [[ontology]], the study of [[being]].

A major point of debate is between [[Philosophical realism|realism]], which holds that there are entities that exist independently of their mental perception and [[idealism]], which holds that reality is mentally constructed or otherwise immaterial. Metaphysics deals with the topic of [[Personal identity|identity]]. [[Essence]] is the set of attributes that make an object what it fundamentally is and without which it loses its identity while [[Accident (philosophy)|accident]] is a property that the object has, without which the object can still retain its identity. [[Particular]]s are objects that are said to exist in space and time, as opposed to [[abstract object]]s, such as numbers, and [[universals]], which are properties held by multiple particulars, such as redness or a gender. The type of existence, if any, of universals and abstract objects is an issue of debate.

=== Epistemology ===
{{Main|Epistemology}}
[[File:Dignaga.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|[[Dignaga]] founded a school of [[Buddhist logic|Buddhist epistemology and logic]].]]
Epistemology is the study of knowledge (Greek episteme).&lt;ref name="WebsterRUD"&gt;{{cite book |last1 = G &amp; C. Merriam Co. |author1-link = Merriam-Webster |title = Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary |edition = 1913 |editors = Noah Porter |publisher = G &amp; C. Merriam Co. |year = 1913 |page = 501 |url = http://machaut.uchicago.edu/?resource=Webster%27s&amp;word=epistemology&amp;use1913=on |accessdate = 13 May 2012 |quote = E*pis`te*mol"o*gy (?), n. [Gr. knowledge + -logy.] The theory or science of the method or grounds of knowledge. |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131015165808/http://machaut.uchicago.edu/?resource=Webster%27s&amp;word=epistemology&amp;use1913=on |archivedate = 15 October 2013 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Epistemologists study the putative sources of knowledge, including intuition, a priori reason, memory, perceptual knowledge, self-knowledge and testimony. They also ask: What is [[truth]]? Is knowledge justified true belief? Are any beliefs [[Theory of justification|justified]]? Putative knowledge includes propositional knowledge (knowledge that something is the case), know-how (knowledge of how to do something) and acquaintance (familiarity with someone or something). Epistemologists examine these and ask whether knowledge is really possible.

[[Philosophical skepticism|Skepticism]] is the position which doubts claims to knowledge. The [[regress argument]], a fundamental problem in epistemology, occurs when, in order to completely prove any statement, its justification itself needs to be supported by another justification. This chain can go on forever, called [[infinitism]], it can eventually rely on [[basic beliefs]] that are left unproven, called [[foundationalism]], or it can go in a circle so that a statement is included in its own chain of justification, called [[coherentism]].

[[Rationalism]] is the emphasis on reasoning as a source of knowledge. It is associated with [[a priori knowledge]], which is independent of experience, such as math and logical deduction. [[Empiricism]] is the emphasis on observational evidence via sensory experience as the source of knowledge.

Among the numerous topics within metaphysics and epistemology, broadly construed are:
* [[Philosophy of language]] explores the nature, the origins and the use of language.
* [[Philosophy of mind]] explores the nature of the mind and its relationship to the body. It is typified by disputes between [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] and [[materialism]]. In recent years this branch has become related to [[cognitive science]].
* [[Human nature|Philosophy of human nature]] analyzes the unique characteristics of human beings, such as rationality, politics and culture.
* [[Metaphilosophy]] explores the aims of philosophy, its boundaries and its methods.

=== Value theory ===
Value theory (or [[axiology]]) is the major branch of philosophy that addresses topics such as goodness, beauty and justice. Value theory includes ethics, aesthetics, political philosophy, feminist philosophy, philosophy of law and more.

==== Ethics ====
{{Main|Ethics}}
[[File:BeijingConfuciusTemple9.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|The [[Beijing]] [[Guozijian (Beijing)|imperial college]] was an intellectual center for Confucian ethics and classics during the [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]], [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] dynasties.]]
Ethics, or "moral philosophy", studies and considers what is good and bad [[Action (philosophy)|conduct]], right and [[wrong]] [[values (philosophy)|values]], and [[good and evil]]. Its primary investigations include how to live a good life and identifying standards of [[morality]]. It also includes [[Meta-analysis|meta-investigations]] about whether a best way to live or related standards exists. The main branches of ethics are [[normative ethics]], [[meta-ethics]]  and [[applied ethics]].

A major area of debate involves [[consequentialism]], in which actions are judged by the potential results of the act, such as to maximize happiness, called [[utilitarianism]], and [[deontology]], in which actions are judged by how they adhere to principles, irrespective of negative ends.

==== Aesthetics ====
{{Main|Aesthetics}}
Aesthetics is the "critical reflection on art, culture and [[nature]]."&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (1998) p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arlisna.org/artdoc/vol18/iss2/01.pdf Review] by Tom Riedel ([[Regis University]])&lt;/ref&gt; It addresses the nature of [[art]], [[beauty]] and [[Taste (sociology)|taste]], enjoyment, emotional values, perception and with the creation and appreciation of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aesthetic|title=Merriam-Webster.com|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aesthetics Definition 1 of ''aesthetics''] from the [[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]] Online.&lt;/ref&gt; It is more precisely defined as the study of [[Senses|sensory]] or sensori-emotional values, sometimes called [[judgment]]s of [[Feeling|sentiment]] and taste.&lt;ref&gt;Zangwill, Nick. "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aesthetic-judgment/ Aesthetic Judgment]", ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', 02-28-2003/10-22-2007. Retrieved 24 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Its major divisions are art theory, [[literary theory]], [[film theory]] and [[music theory]]. An example from art theory is to discern the set of principles underlying the work of a particular artist or artistic movement such as the [[Cubist]] aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/aesthetic|title=aesthetic – definition of aesthetic in English from the Oxford dictionary|website=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[philosophy of film]] analyzes films and filmmakers for their philosophical content and explores film (images, cinema, etc.) as a medium for philosophical reflection and expression.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==== Political philosophy ====
{{Main|Political philosophy}}
[[File:Thomas_Hobbes_(portrait).jpg|left|thumb|[[Thomas Hobbes]]]]

Political philosophy is the study of [[government]] and the relationship of individuals (or families and clans) to communities including the [[State (polity)|state]]. It includes questions about justice, law, property and the rights and obligations of the citizen. Politics and ethics are traditionally linked subjects, as both discuss the question of how people should live together.

Other branches of value theory:
* [[Philosophy of law]] (often called [[jurisprudence]]) explores the varying theories explaining the nature and interpretation of laws.
* [[Philosophy of education]] analyzes the definition and content of education, as well as the goals and challenges of educators.
* [[Feminist philosophy]] explores questions surrounding gender, sexuality and the body including the nature of [[feminism]] itself as a social and philosophical movement.
* [[Philosophy of sport]] analyzes sports, games and other forms of play as sociological and uniquely human activities.

=== Logic, science and mathematics ===
Many academic disciplines generated philosophical inquiry. The relationship between "X" and the "philosophy of X" is debated. [[Richard Feynman]] argued that the philosophy of a topic is irrelevant to its primary study, saying that "[[philosophy of science]] is as useful to scientists as [[ornithology]] is to birds." [[Curtis White (author)|Curtis White]], by contrast, argued that philosophical tools are essential to humanities, sciences and social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Science Delusion: Asking the Big Questions in a Culture of Easy Answers|last=White|first=Curtis|date=2014|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=e2mPgcXPNNIC}}|publisher=Melville House|isbn=9781612193908|location=Brooklyn, NY|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The topics of philosophy of science are [[number]]s, symbols and the formal methods of reasoning as employed in the [[social science]]s and [[natural sciences]].

==== Logic ====
{{Main|Logic}}Logic is the study of reasoning and argument. An argument is "''a'' ''connected series of statements intended to establish a proposition''." The connected series of statements are "[[premise]]s" and the proposition is the conclusion. For example:
# All humans are mortal. (premise)
# Socrates is a human. (premise)
# Therefore, Socrates is mortal. (conclusion)
[[Deductive reasoning]] is when, given certain premises, conclusions are [[Logical consequence|unavoidably implied]]. [[Rules of inference]] are used to infer conclusions such as, [[modus ponens]], where given “A” and “If A then B”, then “B” must be concluded.

Because sound reasoning is an essential element of all sciences,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carnap|first=Rudolf|date=1953|title="Inductive Logic and Science"|jstor=20023651|journal=Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences|volume=80|issue=3|pages=189–197|doi=10.2307/20023651|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; social sciences and humanities disciplines, logic became a [[formal science]]. Sub-fields include [[mathematical logic]], [[philosophical logic]], [[Modal logic]], [[computational logic]] and [[non-classical logic]]s. A major question in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] is whether mathematical entities are objective and discovered, called mathematical realism, or invented, called mathematical antirealism.

==== Philosophy of science ====
{{Main|Philosophy of science}}
This branch explores the foundations, methods, history, implications and purpose of science. Many of its sub-divisions correspond to a specific branch of science. For example, [[philosophy of biology]] deals specifically with the metaphysical, epistemological and ethical issues in the biomedical and life sciences. The [[philosophy of mathematics]] studies the philosophical assumptions, foundations and implications of mathematics.

=== History of philosophy ===
{{See also|Metaphilosophy|History of ethics}}
{{further|Philosophical progress|List of years in philosophy}}
Some philosophers specialize in one or more historical periods. The history of philosophy (study of a specific period, individual or school) is related to but not the same as the [[philosophy of history]] (the theoretical aspect of history, which deals with questions such as the nature of historical evidence and the possibility of objectivity).

Hegel's ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of History]]'' influenced many philosophers to interpret truth in light of history, a view called [[historicism]].

=== Philosophy of religion ===
{{Main|Philosophy of religion}}

Philosophy of religion deals with questions that involve [[religion]] and religious ideas from a philosophically neutral perspective (as opposed to [[theology]] which begins from religious convinctions).&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'': [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/590855/theology/14945/Relationship-to-philosophy Theology; Relationship of theology to the history of religions and philosophy; Relationship to philosophy.]&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, religious questions were not seen as a separate field from philosophy proper, the idea of a separate field only arose in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright, WJ., [https://books.google.com/books?id=GbcuCf9TlDgC&amp;dq=oxford+handbook+Philosophy+religion&amp;q=%22come+into+general%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22come%20into%20general%22&amp;f=false ''The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Religion''], Oxford Handbooks Online, 2004, p. 3. "The expression “philosophy of religion” did not come into general use until the nineteenth century, when it was employed to refer to the articulation and criticism of humanity's religious consciousness and its cultural expressions in thought, language, feeling, and practice."&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues include the [[existence of God]], the relationship between reason and [[faith]], questions of [[religious epistemology]], the [[relationship between religion and science]], how to interpret [[religious experiences]], questions about the possibility of an [[afterlife]], the [[problem of religious language]] and the existence of [[souls]] and responses to [[religious pluralism]] and diversity.

=== Philosophical schools ===
Some philosophers specialize in one or more of the major philosophical schools, such as [[Continental philosophy]], [[Analytical philosophy]], [[Thomism]], [[Asian philosophy]] or [[African philosophy]].

== Other approaches ==
A variety of other academic and non-academic approaches have been explored.

=== Applied philosophy {{anchor|Applied philosophy}} ===
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[List of academic disciplines]] and target of redirect [[Applied philosophy]] --&gt;
[[File:Martin Luther King Jr NYWTS.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Martin Luther King Jr]] ]]
The ideas conceived by a society have profound repercussions on what actions the society performs. [[Richard M. Weaver|Weaver]] argued that ideas have consequences. Philosophy yields applications such as those in [[ethics]] – [[applied ethics]] in particular – and [[political philosophy]]. The political and economic philosophies of [[Confucius]], [[Sun Tzu]], [[Chanakya]], [[Ibn Khaldun]], [[Ibn Rushd]], [[Ibn Taymiyyah]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Adam Smith]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]], [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] have been used to shape and justify governments and their actions. Progressive education as championed by [[John Dewey|Dewey]] had a profound impact on 20th-century US educational practices. Descendants of this movement include efforts in [[philosophy for children]], which are part of [[philosophy education]]. [[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitz]]'s political [[philosophy of war]] has had a profound effect on [[Public administration|statecraft]], [[international politics]] and [[military strategy]] in the 20th century, especially around [[World War II]]. Logic is important in [[mathematics]], [[linguistics]], [[psychology]], [[computer science]] and [[computer engineering]].

Other important applications can be found in [[epistemology]], which aid in understanding the requisites for knowledge, sound evidence and justified belief (important in [[law]], [[economics]], [[decision theory]] and a number of other disciplines). The [[philosophy of science]] discusses the underpinnings of the [[scientific method]] and has affected the nature of scientific investigation and argumentation. Philosophy thus has fundamental implications for science as a whole. For example, the strictly empirical approach of [[B.F. Skinner]]'s behaviorism affected for decades the approach of the American psychological establishment. [[Deep ecology]] and [[animal rights]] examine the moral situation of humans as occupants of a world that has non-human occupants to consider also. [[Aesthetics]] can help to interpret discussions of [[music]], [[literature]], the [[plastic arts]] and the whole artistic dimension of life. In general, the various philosophies strive to provide practical activities with a deeper understanding of the theoretical or conceptual underpinnings of their fields.

Some of those who study philosophy become professional philosophers, typically by working as [[professor]]s who teach, research and write in academic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/where-can-philosophy-take-me|title=Where Can Philosophy Take Me? {{!}} Philosophy|website=philosophy.as.uky.edu|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most students of academic philosophy later contribute to law, journalism, religion, sciences, politics, business, or various arts.&lt;ref name="whystudyphilosophy.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/26/business/philosophers-find-the-degree-pays-off-in-life-and-in-work.html|title=Philosophers Find the Degree Pays Off in Life And in Work|last=Cropper|first=Carol Marie|date=1997-12-26|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, public figures who have degrees in philosophy include comedians [[Steve Martin]] and [[Ricky Gervais]], filmmaker [[Terrence Malick]], [[Pope John Paul II]], Wikipedia co-founder [[Larry Sanger]], technology entrepreneur [[Peter Thiel]], Supreme Court Justice [[Stephen Breyer|Stephen Bryer]] and vice presidential candidate [[Carly Fiorina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mansfield.edu/philosophy/famous-philosophy-majors.cfm|title=Famous Philosophy Majors {{!}} Mansfield University|last=Marketing|first=Mansfield University Department of|website=www.mansfield.edu|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailynous.com/2014/12/08/famous-philosophy-majors-poster/|title=Famous Philosophy Majors Poster (updated with new link)|last=W|first=Justin|date=2014-12-08|website=Daily Nous|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent efforts to avail the general public to the work and relevance of philosophers include the million-dollar [[Berggruen Prize for Philosophy|Berggruen Prize]], first awarded to [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/05/books/canadian-philosopher-wins-1-million-prize.html|title=Canadian Philosopher Wins $1 Million Prize|last=Schuessler|first=Jennifer|date=October 4, 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=October 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional==
Germany was the first country to professionalize philosophy. The [[doctorate of philosophy|doctorate of philosophy (PhD)]] developed in Germany as the terminal Teacher's credential in the mid 17th century.&lt;ref name=EWG&gt;{{cite web |url=http://erhard-weigel-gesellschaft.de.dedi2970.your-server.de/biographie-weigels/ |title=Erhard-Weigel-Gesellschaft: Biographie Weigels |website=Erhard-weigel-gesellschaft.de |date= |accessdate=2016-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114124147/http://erhard-weigel-gesellschaft.de.dedi2970.your-server.de/biographie-weigels/ |archivedate=2016-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1817, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] was the first philosopher to be appointed Professor by the State, namely by the Prussian Minister of Education, as an effect of Napoleonic reform in Prussia. In the United States, the professionalisation grew out of reforms to the American higher-education system largely based on the German model.

Within the last century, philosophy has increasingly become a professional discipline practiced within universities, like other academic disciplines. Accordingly, it has become less general and more specialized. In the view of one prominent recent historian: "Philosophy has become a highly organized discipline, done by specialists primarily for other specialists. The number of philosophers has exploded, the volume of publication has swelled, and the subfields of serious philosophical investigation have multiplied. Not only is the broad field of philosophy today far too vast to be embraced by one mind, something similar is true even of many highly specialized subfields."&lt;ref name="philosophical16"/&gt; Some philosophers argue that this professionalization has negatively affected the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rowmaninternational.com/books/socrates-tenured|title=Socrates Tenured – Rowman &amp; Littlefield International|website=www.rowmaninternational.com|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end result of professionalization for philosophy has meant that work being done in the field is now almost exclusively done by university professors holding a doctorate in the field publishing in highly technical, peer-reviewed journals. While it remains common among the population at large for a person to have a set of religious, political or philosophical views that they consider their "philosophy", these views are rarely informed by or connected to the work being done in professional philosophy today. Furthermore, unlike many of the sciences for which there has come to be a healthy industry of books, magazines, and television shows meant to popularize science and communicate the technical results of a scientific field to the general populace, works by professional philosophers directed at an audience outside the profession remain rare. Philosopher [[Michael Sandel]]'s book ''Justice: What's the Right Thing to Do?'' and [[Harry Frankfurt]]'s ''[[On Bullshit]]'' are examples of works that hold the uncommon distinction of having been written by professional philosophers but directed at and ultimately popular among a broader audience of non-philosophers. Both works became '''New York Times'' best sellers.

==Non-professional==
Many inquiries outside of academia are philosophical in the broad sense. Novelists, playwrights, filmmakers, and musicians, as well as scientists and others engage in recognizably philosophical activity.

[[Ayn Rand]] is the foremost example of an intellectual working contemporaneously with contemporary philosophy but whose contributions were not made within the professional discipline of "philosophy": "For all her [Ayn Rand's] popularity, however, only a few professional philosophers have taken her work seriously. As a result, most of the serious philosophical work on Rand has appeared in non-academic, non-peer-reviewed journals, or in books, and the bibliography reflects this fact."[15]

Also working from outside the profession were philosophers such as [[Gerd B. Achenbach]] (''Die reine und die praktische Philosophie. Drei Vorträge zur philosophischen'' Praxis, 1983) and [[Michel Weber]] (see his ''Épreuve de la philosophie'', 2008) who have proposed since the 1980s various forms of philosophical counseling claiming to bring Socratic dialogues back to life in a quasi-psychotherapeutic framework.

[[Pierre Hadot]] is famous for his analysis on the conception of philosophy during Greco-Roman antiquity. Hadot identified and analyzed the "spiritual exercises" used in ancient philosophy (influencing Michel Foucault's interest in such practices in the second and third volumes of his History of Sexuality). By "spiritual exercises" Hadot means "practices ... intended to effect a modification and a transformation in the subjects who practice them.[6] The philosophy teacher's discourse could be presented in such a way that the disciple, as auditor, reader, or interlocutor, could make spiritual progress and transform himself within."[7] Hadot shows that the key to understanding the original philosophical impulse is to be found in Socrates. What characterizes Socratic therapy above all is the importance given to living contact between human beings. Hadot's recurring theme is that philosophy in antiquity was characterized by a series of spiritual exercises intended to transform the perception, and therefore the being, of those who practice it; that philosophy is best pursued in real conversation and not through written texts and lectures; and that philosophy, as it is taught in universities today, is for the most part a distortion of its original, therapeutic impulse. He brings these concerns together in ''What Is Ancient Philosophy?'',[7] which has been critically reviewed.[8]

==Role of women==
{{Main|Women in philosophy}}
[[File:Langer.Susanne.foto 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|American philosopher of mind and philosopher of art [[Susanne Langer]] (1895–1985).]]
Although men have generally dominated philosophical discourse, women have engaged in philosophy throughout history. [[Women in philosophy|Women philosophers]] have contributed since ancient times–notably [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]] (active c. 325 BCE) and [[Arete of Cyrene]] (active 5th–4th century BCE). More were accepted during the [[ancient philosophy|ancient]], [[Medieval philosophy|medieval]] and [[Modern philosophy|modern]] eras, but no women philosophers became part the [[Western canon]] until the 20th and 21st century, when some sources indicate that [[Susanne Langer]], [[Hannah Arendt]] and [[Simone de Beauvoir]] entered the canon.&lt;ref name="Duran, Jane 2005"&gt;Duran, Jane. Eight women philosophers: theory, politics, and feminism. University of Illinois Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="read.hipporeads.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://read.hipporeads.com/why-i-left-academia-philosophys-homogeneity-needs-rethinking/#|title=Why I Left Academia: Philosophy's Homogeneity Needs Rethinking – Hippo Reads|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170609133754/http://read.hipporeads.com/why-i-left-academia-philosophys-homogeneity-needs-rethinking/|archivedate=9 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1800s, some colleges and universities in the UK and US began [[Mixed-sex education#Higher-education institutions|admitting women]], producing more female academics. Nevertheless, [[U.S. Department of Education]] reports from the 1990s indicate that few women ended up in philosophy, and that philosophy is one of the least gender-proportionate fields in the [[humanities]].&lt;ref name="Salary, Promotion 1997"&gt;"Salary, Promotion, and Tenure Status of Minority and Women Faculty in U.S. Colleges and Universities."National Center for Education Statistics, Statistical Analysis Report, March 2000; U.S. Department of Education, Office of Education Research and Improvement, Report # NCES 2000–173; 1993 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF:93). See also "Characteristics and Attitudes of Instructional Faculty and Staff in the Humanities." National Center For Education Statistics, E.D. Tabs, July 1997. U.S. Department of Education, Office of Education Research and Improvement, Report # NCES 97-973;1993 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF-93).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, ''[[Inside Higher Education]]'' described the philosophy "...discipline's own long history of [[misogyny]] and [[sexual harassment]]" of women students and professors.&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/05/19/unofficial-internet-campaign-outs-professor-alleged-sexual-harassment-attempted|title=Unofficial Internet campaign outs professor for alleged sexual harassment, attempted assault|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Sheffield]] philosophy professor [[Jennifer Saul]] stated in 2015 that women are "...leaving philosophy after being harassed, assaulted, or retaliated against."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/jan/05/philosophy-is-for-posh-white-boys-with-trust-funds-why-are-there-so-few-women|title=Philosophy is for posh, white boys with trust funds' – why are there so few women?|first1=Rebecca|last1=Ratcliffe|first2=Claire|last2=Shaw|date=5 January 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, the [[Canadian Philosophical Association]] noted a gender imbalance and [[gender bias]] in the academic field of philosophy.&lt;ref name="nas.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nas.org/articles/women_in_philosophy_problems_with_the_discrimination_hypothesis|title=Women in Philosophy: Problems with the Discrimination Hypothesis |publisher=National Association of Scholars}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, a US sociology professor stated that "out of all recent citations in four prestigious philosophy journals, female authors comprise just 3.6 percent of the total."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Neven |last1=Sesardic |first2=Rafael |last2=De Clercq |title=Women in Philosophy: Problems with the Discrimination Hypothesis |doi= 10.1007/s12129-014-9464-x|journal=Academic Questions|volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=461 |year=2014 |url=http://www.ln.edu.hk/philoso/staff/sesardic/WIP-AQ.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Price argues that the philosophical "...canon remains dominated by white males – the discipline that...still hews to the myth that genius is tied to gender."&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/05/reviving-the-female-canon/393110/|title=Reviving the Female Canon|first=Susan|last=Price|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan Thompson suggests that discrimination, differences in abilities, grade differences and the lack of role models in philosophy could be potential factors for the gender gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Morgan|date=2017-03-01|title=Explanations of the gender gap in philosophy|journal=Philosophy Compass|language=en|volume=12|issue=3|pages=n/a|doi=10.1111/phc3.12406|issn=1747-9991}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Saul, "[p]hilosophy, the oldest of the [[humanities]], is also the malest (and the whitest).  While other areas of the humanities are at or near gender parity, philosophy is actually more overwhelmingly male than even mathematics."&lt;ref name="salon.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/08/15/philosophy_has_a_sexual_harassment_problem/|title=Philosophy has a sexual harassment problem|first=Jennifer M.|last=Saul|publisher=|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popular culture ==
In 2000, the [[Open Court Publishing Company]] began publishing a series of books on philosophy and [[popular culture]]. Each book consists of essays written by philosophers for general readers. The books "explore the meanings, concepts and puzzles within television shows, movies, music and other icons of popular culture"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opencourtbooks.com/categories/pcp.htm|title=Popular Culture and Philosophy|website=www.opencourtbooks.com|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; analyzing topics such as the TV shows ''[[Seinfeld]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]'' movies and related media and new technological developments such as the [[iPod]] and [[Facebook]]. Their most recent publication ({{As of|2016|lc=y}}) is titled ''Louis C.K. and Philosophy''; its subject is the comedian [[Louis C.K.]].

''[[The Matrix]]'' makes numerous references to philosophy including [[Buddhism]], [[Vedanta]], [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita]] [[Hinduism]], [[Christianity]], [[Messianism]], [[Judaism]], [[Gnosticism]], [[existentialism]] and [[nihilism]]. The film's premise resembles [[Plato]]'s [[Allegory of the Cave|Allegory of the cave]], Descartes's [[evil demon]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s reflections on the [[Phenomenon]] versus the [[Noumenon|Ding an sich]], [[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'s "[[Zhuangzi dreamed he was a butterfly]]", Marxist social theory and the [[brain in a vat]] thought experiment. Many references to [[Jean Baudrillard|Baudrillard]]'s ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]'' appear in the film, although Baudrillard himself considered this a misrepresentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ubishops.ca/BaudrillardStudies/vol2_2/rovira.htm |title=IJBS |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2010-10-21 |accessdate=2012-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021010544/http://www.ubishops.ca/BaudrillardStudies/vol2_2/rovira.htm |archivedate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Everyone has some general conception of the nature of the world in which they live and of their place in it. Metaphysics replaces the unargued assumptions embodied in such a conception with a rational and organized body of beliefs about the world as a whole. Everyone has occasion to doubt and question beliefs, their own or those of others, with more or less success and without any theory of what they are doing. Epistemology seeks by argument to make explicit the rules of correct belief formation. Everyone governs their conduct by directing it to desired or valued ends.

'''Philosophy and literature''' involves the [[literature|literary]] treatment of [[philosopher]]s and [[philosophy|philosophical]] themes (the literature of philosophy), and the philosophical treatment of issues raised by literature (the philosophy of literature).

[[Image:Socrates Louvre.jpg|thumb|''[[The Clouds]]'' by [[Aristophanes]] presented [[Socrates]] as a comic figure.]]

==The philosophy of literature==
Strictly speaking, the philosophy of literature is a branch of [[aesthetics]], the branch of philosophy that deals with the question, "what is [[art]]"?  Much of aesthetic philosophy has traditionally focused on the plastic arts or [[music]], however, at the expense of the verbal arts.  In fact, much traditional discussion of aesthetic philosophy seeks to establish criteria of artistic quality that are indifferent to the subject matter being depicted.  Since all literary works, almost by definition, contain notional content, aesthetic theories that rely on purely formal qualities tend to overlook literature.

The very existence of [[narrative]] raises philosophical issues.  In narrative, a creator can embody, and readers be led to imagine, [[fiction]]al characters, and even [[fantasy|fantastic]] creatures or technologies.  The ability of the human mind to imagine, and even to experience [[empathy]] with, these fictional characters is itself revealing about the nature of the human mind.  Some fiction can be thought of as a sort of a [[thought experiment]] in [[ethics]]: it describes fictional characters, their [[Motivation|motive]]s, their actions, and the consequences of their actions.  It is in this light that some philosophers have chosen various narrative forms to teach their philosophy (''see below'').

===Literature and language===
[[Plato]], for instance, believed that literary culture and even the [[lyrics]] of [[popular music]] had a strong impact on the ethical outlook of its consumers.  In ''[[Republic (dialogue)|The Republic]]'', Plato displays a strong hostility to the contents of the literary culture of his period, and proposes a strong [[censorship]] of popular literature in his [[utopia]].

More recently, however, philosophers of various stripes have taken different and less hostile approaches to literature.  Since the work of the [[British Empiricists]] and [[Immanuel Kant]] in the late eighteenth century, Western philosophy has been preoccupied with a fundamental question of [[epistemology]]: the question of the relationship between [[idea]]s in the human mind and the world existing outside the mind, if in fact such a world exists.  In more recent years, these epistemological issues have turned instead to an extended discussion of [[word]]s and meaning: can [[language]] in fact bridge the barrier between minds?  This cluster of issues concerning the meaning of language and of "[[writing]]s" sometimes goes by the name of ''the [[linguistic turn]]''.

As such, techniques and tools developed for [[literary criticism]] and [[literary theory]] rose to greater prominence in Western philosophy of the late twentieth century.  Philosophers of various stripes paid more attention to literature than their predecessors did.  Some sought to examine the question of whether it was in fact truly possible to communicate using words, whether it was possible for an author's intended meaning to be communicated to a reader.  Others sought to use literary works as examples of contemporary [[culture]], and sought to reveal unconscious attitudes they felt present in these works for the purpose of social criticism.

===The truth of fiction===
Literary works also pose issues concerning [[truth]] and the [[philosophy of language]].  In educated opinion, at least, it is commonly reputed as true that ''[[Sherlock Holmes]] lived in London''. (see David Lewis 'Truth in Fiction', American Philosophical Quarterly, Vol. 15. No. 1, January 1978)  It is also considered true that ''[[Samuel Pepys]] lived in London''.  Yet Sherlock Holmes never lived anywhere at all; he is a fictional character.  Samuel Pepys, contrarily, is judged to have been a real person.  Contemporary interest in Holmes and in Pepys share strong similarities; the only reason why anyone knows either of their names is because of an abiding interest in reading about their alleged deeds and words.  These two statements would appear to belong to two different orders of truth.  Further problems arise concerning the [[truth value]] of statements about fictional worlds and characters that can be implied but are nowhere explicitly stated by the sources for our knowledge about them, such as ''Sherlock Holmes had only one head'' or ''Sherlock Holmes never travelled to the moon''.

==The literature of philosophy==

===Philosophical poems===
{{Literature}}
A number of [[poetry|poets]] have written poems on philosophical themes, and some important philosophers have expressed their philosophy in verse.  The [[cosmogony]] of [[Hesiod]] and the ''[[De Rerum Natura]]'' of [[Lucretius]] are important philosophical poems. The genre of [[epic poetry]] was also used to teach philosophy. [[Vyasa]] narrated the ancient [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epic]] ''[[Mahabharata]]'' in order to teach [[Indian philosophy]] and [[Hindu philosophy]]. [[Homer]] also presented some philosophical teachings in his ''[[Odyssey]]''.

Many of the [[Eastern philosophy|Eastern philosophers]] worked out their thought in poetical fashion. Some of the important names include:

* [[Vyasa]]
* [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi]]
* [[Omar Khayyám]]
* [[Nizami Ganjavi]]
* [[Saadi (poet)|Sheikh Saadi]]
* [[Hafez|Hafiz Shirazi]]
* [[Muhammad Iqbal]]
* [[Matsuo Bashō]]
* [[Farid ud-Din Attar]]
* [[Salah Abd El-sabur]]
* [[Mahmoud Darwish]]
* [[Karim Elsaiad]]

Notable Western [[philosophical poets]] include:

* [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]
* [[St. John of the Cross]]
* [[T. S. Eliot]]
* [[Hildegard von Bingen]]
* [[Homer]]
* [[John Milton]]
* [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]
* [[James Wright (poet)|James Wright]]
* [[Marianne Moore]]
* [[Pablo Neruda]]
* [[William Carlos Williams]]
* [[Mary Oliver]]
* [[ Rainer Maria Rilke]]
* [[Leslie Marmon Silko]]
* [[Robert Creeley]]
* [[Fernando Pessoa]]
* [[Søren Kierkegaard]]
* [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]
* [[Georges Bataille]]
* [[Lucretius]]

===Philosophical fiction===
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Borges.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Jorge Luis Borges]] wrote philosophical fiction.]] --&gt;
Some philosophers have undertaken to write philosophy in the form of [[fiction]], including novels and short stories (see separate article on [[philosophical fiction]]).  This is apparent early on in the literature of philosophy, where philosophers such as [[Plato]] wrote [[dialogue]]s in which fictional or fictionalized characters discuss philosophical subjects; [[Socrates]] frequently appears as a protagonist in Plato's dialogues, and the dialogues are one of the prime sources of knowledge about Socrates' teaching, though at this remove it is sometimes hard to distinguish Socrates' actual positions from Plato's own. Numerous early Christian writers, including [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Boethius]], and [[Peter Abelard]] produced dialogues; several early modern philosophers, such as [[George Berkeley]] and [[David Hume]], wrote occasionally in this genre.

Other philosophers have resorted to [[narrative]] to get their teachings across. The classical 12th century [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosopher]], [[Ibn Tufail|Abubacer]] (Ibn Tufail), wrote a fictional [[Arabic literature|Arabic narrative]] ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan|Philosophus Autodidactus]]'' as a response to [[al-Ghazali]]'s ''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]'', and then the 13th century [[Kalam|Islamic theologian]]-philosopher [[Ibn al-Nafis]] also wrote a fictional narrative ''Theologus Autodidactus'' as a response to Abubacer's ''Philosophus Autodidactus''. The German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] often articulated his ideas in literary modes, most notably in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', a re-imagined account of the teachings of [[Zoroaster]]. [[Marquis de Sade]] and [[Ayn Rand]] wrote novels in which characters served as mouthpieces for philosophical positions, and act in accordance with them in the plot. [[George Santayana]] was also a philosopher who wrote novels and poetry; the relationship between Santayana's characters and his beliefs is more complex.  The [[existentialism|existentialists]] include among their numbers important [[French language|French]] authors who used fiction to convey their philosophical views; these include [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s novel ''[[Nausea (Book)|Nausea]]'' and play ''[[No Exit]]'', and [[Albert Camus]]'s  ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]''. [[Maurice Blanchot]]'s entire fictional production, whose titles include ''[[The Step Not Beyond]]'', ''[[The madness of the Day]]'', and ''[[The Writing of Disaster]]'', among others, constitutes an indispensable corpus for the treatment of the relationship between philosophy and literature. So does [[Jacques Derrida]]'s ''[[The Post Card: From Socrates to Freud and Beyond]]''.

A number of philosophers have had important influence on literature.  [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], largely as a result of his [[Schopenhauer's aesthetics|system of aesthetics]], is perhaps the most influential recent philosopher in the history of literature; [[Thomas Hardy]]'s later novels frequently allude to Schopenhauerian themes, particularly in ''[[Jude the Obscure]]''.  Schopenhauer also had an important influence on [[Joseph Conrad]].  Schopenhauer also had a less specific but more  widely diffused influence on the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist movement]] in European literature.  [[Lionel Johnson]] also refers to Schopenhauer's aesthetics in his essay ''The Cultured Faun''. [[Jacques Derrida]]'s entire oeuvre has been hugely influential for so-called continental philosophy and the understanding of the role of literature in modernity.

Other works of fiction considered to have philosophical content include:

*Abubacer, ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan|Philosophus Autodidactus]]''
*Albert Camus, ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Outsider]]''
*Joseph Conrad, ''[[Heart of Darkness]]''
*Fyodor Dostoevsky, ''[[Crime and Punishment]]
*Jostein Gaarder, ''[[Sophie's World]]
* Hermann Hesse, ''[[The Glass Bead Game]]
*James Joyce, ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''
*Franz Kafka, ''[[The Metamorphosis]]''
*Milan Kundera, ''[[The Unbearable Lightness of Being]]''
*Ibn al-Nafis, ''[[Theologus Autodidactus]]''
*Thomas Mann, ''[[The Magic Mountain]]''
*Iris Murdoch, ''[[The Sea, the Sea]]''
*Robert M. Pirsig, ''[[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]]''
*Marcel Proust, ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]
*William Shakespeare, ''[[Hamlet]]''
*Leo Tolstoy, ''[[The Death of Ivan Ilyich]]''
*Sergio Troncoso, ''[[The Nature of Truth]]''
*Marguerite Yourcenar, ''[[Memoirs of Hadrian]]''

===Philosophical writing as literature===
A number of philosophers are still read for the literary merits of their works apart from their philosophical content.  The philosophy in the ''[[Meditations]]'' of the [[Roman emperor]] [[Marcus Aurelius]] is unoriginal [[Stoicism]], but the ''Meditations'' are still read for their literary merit and for the insight they give into the workings of the emperor's mind.

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s philosophy is noted for the quality and readability of its prose, as are some of the works of the [[British Empiricism|British Empiricists]], such as [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[David Hume|Hume]].  [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s style is frequently regarded as poetic artistry as well as philosophical, especially in ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'' and ''[[Either/Or]]''.  [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s works such as ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' frequently resemble [[prose poetry]] and contain imagery and allusion instead of argument.

==Philosophy in literature==

===Philosophers in literature===
Socrates appears in a highly fictionalized guise, as a comic figure and the object of mockery, in ''[[The Clouds]]'' by [[Aristophanes]].  In the play, Socrates appears hanging from a basket, where he delivers oracles such as:

:I'd never come up with a single thing&lt;br&gt; about celestial phenomena,&lt;br&gt;if I did not suspend my mind up high,&lt;br&gt;to mix my subtle thoughts with what's like them—&lt;br&gt;the air. If I turned my mind to lofty things,&lt;br&gt;but stayed there on the ground, I'd never make&lt;br&gt;the least discovery. For the earth, you see,&lt;br&gt;draws moist thoughts down by force into itself—&lt;br&gt;the same process takes place with water cress.

[[Jorge Luis Borges]] is perhaps the twentieth century's preeminent author of philosophical fiction.  He wrote a short story in which the philosopher [[Averroes]] is the chief protagonist, ''[[Averroes's Search]]''.  Many plot points in his stories accurately paraphrase and epitomize the thought of major philosophers, including [[George Berkeley]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], and [[Bertrand Russell]]; he also attributes various opinions to figures including [[George Dalgarno]].

A key plot point in [[Umberto Eco]]'s novel ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'' turns on the discovery of a mysterious book that turns out to contain a lost manuscript by [[Aristotle]].  Eco's later novel ''[[Foucault's Pendulum (book)|Foucault's Pendulum]]'' became the forerunner of a run of [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]]s or [[detective fiction]] that toss around learned allusions and the names of historical thinkers; more recent examples include [[Dan Brown]]'s ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' and ''[[The Rule of Four (book)|The Rule of Four]]'' by [[Ian Caldwell]] and [[Dustin Thomason]].

Also, [[Philip K. Dick]], who has often been compared to Borges, raises a significant number of philosophical issues in his novels, everything from the problem of [[solipsism]] to many questions of [[perception]] and [[reality]].

===Fictional philosophers===
Jorge Luis Borges introduces many philosophical themes, and a number of fictional philosophers, in his [[short story|short stories]].  A fictional philosophical movement is a part of the premise of his story ''[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]'', and the unnamed narrator of his story ''[[The Library of Babel]]'' could also be called a fictional philosopher.  A fictional [[theology|theologian]] is the subject of his story ''[[Three Versions of Judas]]''.

Fictional philosophers occasionally occur throughout the works of [[Robert A. Heinlein]] and [[Ray Bradbury]].  Heinlein's ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'' contains long passages that could be considered as successors to the fictionalized philosophical dialogues of the ancient world, set within the plot.

The '''[[philosophy]] of [[healthcare]]''' is the study of the [[ethics]], processes, and people which constitute the maintenance of health for human beings. (Although [[veterinary]] concerns are worthy to note, the body of thought regarding their methodologies and practices is not addressed in this article.) For the most part, however, the philosophy of healthcare is best approached as an indelible component of human social structures. That is, the societal institution of healthcare can be seen as a necessary [[phenomenon]] of human [[civilization]] whereby an individual continually seeks to improve, mend, and alter the overall nature and quality of their life. This perennial concern is especially prominent in modern political liberalism, wherein health has been understood as the foundational good necessary for public life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/putting-health-in-perspective Yuval Levin, "Putting Health in Perspective," ''The New Atlantis'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophy of healthcare is primarily concerned with the following elemental questions:

*Who requires and/or deserves healthcare? Is healthcare a fundamental right of all people?
*What should be the basis for calculating the cost of treatments, hospital stays, drugs, etc.?
*How can healthcare best be administered to the greatest number of people?
*What are the necessary parameters for [[clinical trials]] and [[quality assurance]]?
*Who, if anybody, can decide when a patient is in need of "comfort measures" (allowing a natural death by providing medications to treat symptoms related to the patient's illness)?

However, the most important question of all is 'what is health?'. Unless this question is addressed any debate about healthcare will be vague and unbounded. For example, what exactly is a health care intervention? What differentiates healthcare from engineering or teaching, for example? Is health care about 'creating autonomy' or acting in people's best interests? Or is it always both? A 'philosophy' of anything requires baseline philosophical questions, as asked, for example, by philosopher [https://books.google.com/books?id=RvGXLF3uxd0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=david+seedhouse+health+the+foundations+for+achievement&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=f2lwAOsSnz&amp;sig=m1x991yrTldDBtju1BzbZIKTQUU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3y-mTMycK5TEsAPHsMT-Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false David Seedhouse].

Ultimately, the purpose, objective and meaning of healthcare philosophy is to consolidate the abundance of information regarding the ever-changing fields of [[biotechnology]], medicine, and [[nursing]]. And seeing that healthcare typically ranks as one of the largest spending areas of governmental budgets, it becomes important to gain a greater understanding of healthcare as not only a social institution, but also as a political one. In addition, healthcare philosophy attempts to highlight the primary movers of healthcare systems; be it nurses, [[Physician|doctor]]s, [[allied health professional]]s, hospital administrators, [[health insurance]] companies ([[HMO]]s and [[Preferred provider organization|PPO]]s), the government ([[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]]), and lastly, the patients themselves.

==Ethics of healthcare==
[[File:Hippocrates rubens.jpg|thumb|[[Hippocrates]], the ancient Greek physician, considered the father of [[Western medicine]].]]

The ethical and/or moral premises of healthcare are complex and intricate. To consolidate such a large segment of [[moral philosophy]], it becomes important to focus on what separates healthcare ethics from other forms of morality. And on the whole, it can be said that healthcare itself is a "''special''" institution within society.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Daniels, "Healthcare Needs and Distributive Justice," ''Bioethics'' Ed. John Harris (New York: Oxford University Press, 2001), 319.&lt;/ref&gt; With that said, healthcare ought to "be treated differently from other social goods" in a society.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, "Healthcare Needs and Distributive Justice," 319.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an institution of which we are all a part whether we like it or not. At some point in every person's life, a decision has to be made regarding one's healthcare. Can they afford it? Do they deserve it? Do they need it? Where should they go to get it? Do they even want it? And it is this last question which poses the biggest dilemma facing a person. After weighing all of the costs and benefits of her healthcare situation, the person has to decide if the costs of healthcare outweigh the benefits. More than basic economic issues are at stake in this conundrum. In fact, a person must decide whether or not their life is ending or if it is worth salvaging. Of course, in instances where the patient is unable to decide due to medical complications, like a [[coma]], then the decision must come from elsewhere. And defining that "elsewhere" has proven to be a very difficult endeavor in healthcare philosophy.

===Medical ethics===
{{Further|Medical ethics}}
Whereas [[bioethics]] tends to deal with more broadly-based issues like the consecrated nature of the human body and the roles of science and technology in healthcare, medical ethics is specifically focused on applying ethical principles to the field of medicine. Medical ethics has its roots in the writings of [[Hippocrates]], and the practice of medicine was often used as an example in ethical discussions by [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;Edmund D. Pellegrino, "The Philosophy of Medicine Reborn" (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 2008), 258.&lt;/ref&gt; As a systematic field, however, it is a large and relatively new area of study in ethics. One of the major premises of medical ethics surrounds "the development of valuational measures of outcomes of health care treatments and programs; these outcome measures are designed to guide health policy and so must be able to be applied to substantial numbers of people, including across or even between whole societies."&lt;ref&gt;Dan Brock, "Quality of Life Measures in Health Care and Medical Ethics," ''Bioethics'' Ed. John Harris (New York: Oxford University Press, 2001), 387.&lt;/ref&gt; Terms like [[Beneficence (ethics)|beneficence]] and [[Primum non nocere|non-maleficence]] are vital to the overall understanding of medical ethics. Therefore, it becomes important to acquire a basic grasp of the varying dynamics that go into a doctor-patient relationship.

===Nursing ethics===
{{Further|Nursing ethics}}
Like medical ethics, nursing ethics is very narrow in its focus, especially when compared to the expansive field of bioethics. For the most part, "nursing ethics can be defined as having a two-pronged meaning," whereby it is "the examination of all kinds of ethical and bioethical issues from the perspective of nursing theory and practice."&lt;ref&gt;Janie Butts and Karen Rich, "Moral and Ethical Dimensions in Professional Nursing Practice," ''Role Development in Professional Nursing Practice'' Ed. Kathleen Masters (Sudbury: Jones and Bartlett Publishers, 2005), 66.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition, although quite vague, centers on the practical and theoretical approaches to nursing. The [[American Nurses Association]] (ANA) endorses an ethical code that emphasizes "values" and "evaluative judgments" in all areas of the nursing profession.&lt;ref&gt;Butts and Rich, "Moral and Ethical Dimensions in Professional Nursing Practice," 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of values is being increasingly recognized in all aspects of healthcare and health research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kelly | first1 = M |last2 = Heath | first2 = I |last3 = Howick | first3 = J |last4 = Greenhalgh | first4 = T | title = The importance of values in evidence-based medicine | doi = 10.1186/s12910-015-0063-3 | journal = BMC Medical Ethics | volume = 16 | issue = 69 |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Fulford | first1 = KWM |last2 = Peile | first2 = H |last3 = Carroll | first3 = H | title = Essential Values-Based Practice | isbn = 9780521530255 | url = http://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/medicine/medicine-general-interest/essential-values-based-practice-clinical-stories-linking-science-people }}&lt;/ref&gt; And since moral issues are extremely prevalent throughout nursing, it is important to be able to recognize and critically respond to situations that warrant and/or necessitate an ethical decision.

===Business ethics===
{{Further|Health economics}}
Balancing the cost of care with the quality of care is a major issue in healthcare philosophy. In Canada and some parts of Europe, democratic governments play a major role in determining how much public money from taxation should be directed towards the healthcare process. In the United States and other parts of Europe, private health insurance corporations as well as government agencies are the agents in this precarious life-and-death balancing act. According to medical ethicist Leonard J. Weber, "Good-quality healthcare means cost-effective healthcare," but "more expensive healthcare does not mean higher-quality healthcare" and "certain minimum standards of quality must be met for all patients" regardless of health insurance status.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard J. Weber, ''Business Ethics in Healthcare: Beyond Compliance'' (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2001), 30.&lt;/ref&gt; This statement undoubtedly reflects the varying thought processes going into the bigger picture of a healthcare [[cost-benefit analysis]]. In order to streamline this tedious process, health maintenance organizations (HMOs) like [[Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association|BlueCross BlueShield]] employ large numbers of [[actuary|actuaries]] (colloquially known as "insurance adjusters") to ascertain the appropriate balance between cost, quality, and necessity in a patient's healthcare plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/30/business/la-fi-health-insurance-20100730 Actuaries, HMOs, and State Politics]&lt;/ref&gt; A general rule in the health insurance industry is as follows:{{quotation|The least costly treatment should be provided unless there is substantial evidence that a more costly intervention is likely to yield a superior outcome.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Weber, ''Business Ethics in Healthcare: Beyond Compliance'', 31.&lt;/ref&gt;}} This generalized rule for healthcare institutions "is perhaps one of the best expressions of the practical meaning of [[stewardship]] of resources," especially since "the burden of proof is on justifying the more expensive intervention, not the less expensive one, when different acceptable treatment options exist."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; And lastly, [[Frivolous litigation|frivolous lawsuits]] have been cited as major precipitants of increasing healthcare costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://headaches.about.com/cs/advocacy/a/lamus_cala.htm Are Frivolous Lawsuits Driving Up Healthcare Costs?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political philosophy of healthcare==
{{Further|Health care politics}}
In the [[political philosophy]] of healthcare, the debate between [[universal healthcare]] and [[private healthcare]] is particularly contentious in the United States. In the 1960s, there was a plethora of public initiatives by the federal government to consolidate and modernize the U.S. healthcare system. With [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s [[Great Society]], the U.S. established public health insurance for both senior citizens and the underprivileged. Known as Medicare and Medicaid, these two healthcare programs granted certain groups of Americans access to adequate healthcare services. Although these healthcare programs were a giant step in the direction of [[socialized medicine]], many people think that the U.S. needs to do more for its citizenry with respect to healthcare coverage.&lt;ref name="CESR"&gt;Center for Economic and Social Rights. [http://cesr.org/ushealthright "The Right to Health in the United States of America: What Does It Mean?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927013858/http://cesr.org/ushealthright |date=27 September 2007 }} (29 October 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of universal healthcare see it as an erosion of the high quality of care that already exists in the United States.&lt;ref name="LeonardPeikoff"&gt;Leonard Peikoff, [http://afcm.org/hcinar2.html "Health Care Is Not a Right,"] (11 December 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Medicare.gif|thumb|right|500px|U.S. [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] (2008)]]

===Patients' Bill of Rights===
{{Further|U.S. Patients' Bill of Rights}}
In 2001, the U.S. federal government took up an initiative to provide patients with an explicit list of rights concerning their healthcare. The political philosophy behind such an initiative essentially blended ideas of the [[Consumer Bill of Rights|Consumers' Bill of Rights]] with the field of healthcare. It was undertaken in an effort to ensure the quality of care of all patients by preserving the integrity of the processes that occur in the healthcare industry.&lt;ref name="democrats.senate.gov"&gt;[http://democrats.senate.gov/pbr/summary.html Summary of the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy Patients' Bill of Rights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414202540/http://democrats.senate.gov/pbr/summary.html |date=14 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Standardizing the nature of healthcare institutions in this manner proved provocative. In fact, many [[interest group]]s, including the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) and [[Pharmaceutical lobby|Big Pharma]] came out against the congressional bill. Basically, having hospitals provide emergency medical care to anyone, regardless of [[health insurance]] status, as well as the right of a patient to hold their health plan accountable for any and all harm done proved to be the two biggest stumbling blocks for the bill.&lt;ref name="democrats.senate.gov"/&gt; As a result of this intense opposition, the initiative eventually failed to pass [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 2002.

===Health insurance===
[[File:Tommydouglas1945.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Tommy Douglas|Tommy Douglas']] (centre left)  number one concern was the creation of [[Medicare (Canada)|Canadian Medicare]]. In the summer of 1962,  [[Saskatchewan]] became the centre of a hard-fought struggle between the provincial government, the North American medical establishment, and the province's  physicians, who brought things to a halt with a doctors' strike.]]
{{Further|Health insurance}}
Health insurance is the primary mechanism through which individuals cover healthcare costs in [[industrialized countries]]. It can be obtained from either the [[government|public]] or [[corporation|private]] sector of the economy. In Canada, for example, the [[Canadian provinces|provincial governments]] administer public health insurance coverage to citizens and permanent residents. According to Health Canada, the political philosophy of public insurance in Canada is as follows:{{quotation|The administration and delivery of health care services is the responsibility of each province or territory, guided by the provisions of the [[Canada Health Act]]. The provinces and territories fund these services with assistance from the federal government in the form of fiscal transfers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/delivery-prestation/ptrole/index-eng.php Provincial/Territorial Role in Health]&lt;/ref&gt;}} And the driving force behind such a political philosophy in Canada was [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] politician [[Tommy Douglas]].

Contrasting with the U.S., but similar to Canada, Australia and New Zealand have [[universal healthcare]] systems known as [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] and ACC ([[Accident Compensation Corporation]]), respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicareaustralia.gov.au/ Medicare Australia][http://www.acc.co.nz/index.htm ACC Government Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian Medicare originated with [[Health Insurance Act 1973]]. It was introduced by Prime Minister (PM) [[Gough Whitlam]]'s Labor Government, and was intended to provide affordable treatment by doctors in public hospitals for all resident citizens. Redesigned by PM [[Bob Hawke]] in 1984, the current Medicare system permits citizens the option to purchase private health insurance in a [[two-tier health care|two-tier health system]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourhealth.gov.au/internet/yourhealth/publishing.nsf/Content/nphc-draftreportsupp-toc~nphc-draftreportsupp-ch3#.T2JX3GJWpss Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and scholarship==
Considering the rapid pace at which the fields of medicine and health science are developing, it becomes important to investigate the most proper and/or efficient methodologies for conducting research. On the whole, "the primary concern of the researcher must always be the [[phenomenon]], from which the research question is derived, and only subsequent to this can decisions be made as to the most appropriate research [[methodology]], design, and methods to fulfill the purposes of the research."&lt;ref&gt;Philippa Seaton, "Combining Interpretive Methodologies: Maximizing the Richness of Findings," ''Beyond Method: Philosophical Conversations in Healthcare Research and Scholarship'' Ed. Pamela M. Ironside (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 2005), 217.&lt;/ref&gt; This statement on research methodology places the researcher at the forefront of his findings. That is, the researcher becomes the person who makes or breaks his or her scientific inquiries rather than the research itself. Even so, "interpretive research and scholarship are creative processes, and methods and methodology are not always singular, ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'', fixed and unchanging."&lt;ref&gt;Seaton, "Combining Interpretive Methodologies: Maximizing the Richness of Findings," 217.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, viewpoints on scientific inquiries into healthcare matters "will continue to grow and develop with the creativity and insight of interpretive researchers, as they consider emerging ways of investigating the complex social world."&lt;ref&gt;Seaton, "Combining Interpretive Methodologies: Maximizing the Richness of Findings," 217-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clinical trials===
{{Further|Clinical trials}}
Clinical trials are a means through which the healthcare industry tests a new drug, treatment, or medical device. The traditional methodology behind clinical trials consists of various phases in which the emerging product undergoes a series of intense tests, most of which tend to occur on interested and/or compliant patients. The U.S. government has an established network for tackling the emergence of new products in the healthcare industry. The [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) does not conduct trials on new drugs coming from [[pharmaceutical]] companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/7086fnl.htm Guidance for Industry, Investigators, and Reviewers in Exploratory Drug Studies (FDA January 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the FDA, the [[National Institutes of Health]] sets the guidelines for all kinds of clinical trials relating to [[infectious diseases]]. For cancer, the [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI) sponsors a series or cooperative groups like [[CALGB]] and [[Children's Oncology Group|COG]] in order to standardize protocols for cancer treatment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cancer.gov/aboutnci/overview/mission Mission Statement of the National Cancer Institute (NCI)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ogco fda 1006.jpg|thumb|right|300px|U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (2006)]]

===Quality assurance===
{{Further|Quality assurance}}
The primary purpose of quality assurance (QA) in healthcare is to ensure that the quality of patient care is in accordance with established guidelines. The government usually plays a significant role in providing structured guidance for treating a particular disease or ailment. However, protocols for treatment can also be worked out at individual healthcare institutions like hospitals and HMOs. In some cases, quality assurance is seen as a superfluous endeavor, as many healthcare-based QA organizations, like [[QARC]], are publicly funded at the hands of taxpayers.&lt;ref name="Quality Assurance Review Center"&gt;[http://www.qarc.org/ Quality Assurance Review Center]&lt;/ref&gt; However, many people would agree that healthcare quality assurance, particularly in the areas cancer treatment and disease control are necessary components to the vitality of any legitimate healthcare system. With respect to quality assurance in cancer treatment scenarios, the [[Quality Assurance Review Center]] (QARC) is just one example of a QA facility that seeks "to improve the standards of care" for patients "by improving the quality of clinical trials medicine."&lt;ref name="Quality Assurance Review Center"/&gt;

==Birth and death==

===Reproductive rights===
{{Further|Abortion}}
The [[ecophilosophy]] of [[Garrett Hardin]] is one perspective from which to analyze the reproductive rights of human beings. For the most part, Hardin argues that it is immoral to have large families, especially since they do a disservice to society by consuming an excessive amount of resources. In an essay titled ''[[The Tragedy of the Commons]]'', Hardin states,{{quotation|To couple the concept of [[liberty|freedom]] to breed with the belief that everyone born has an equal right to the commons is to lock the world into a tragic course of action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles/art_tragedy_of_the_commons.html Garrett Hardin, "Freedom to Breed is Intolerable," ''The Tragedy of the Commons'']&lt;/ref&gt;}} By encouraging the freedom to breed, the [[welfare state]] not only provides for children, but also sustains itself in the process. The net effect of such a policy is the inevitability of a [[Malthusian catastrophe]].

Hardin's ecophilosophy reveals one particular method to mitigate healthcare costs. With respect to population growth, the fewer people there are to take care of, the less expensive healthcare will be. And in applying this [[logic]] to what medical ethicist Leonard J. Weber previously suggested, less expensive healthcare does not necessarily mean poorer quality healthcare.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Birth and living===
{{Further|Eugenics}}
The concept of being "''well-born''" is not new, and may carry racist undertones. The [[Nazis]] practiced [[eugenics]] in order to cleanse the gene pool of what were perceived to be unwanted or harmful elements. This "race hygiene movement in Germany evolved from a [[theory]] of [[Social Darwinism]], which had become popular throughout Europe" and the United States during the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Naomi Baumslag, ''Murderous Medicine: Nazi Doctors, Human Experimentation, and Typhus'' (Westport: Praeger Publishers, 2005), 35.&lt;/ref&gt; A German phrase that embodies the nature of this practice is ''lebensunwertes Leben'' or "life unworthy of life."&lt;ref&gt;Baumslag, ''Murderous Medicine: Nazi Doctors, Human Experimentation, and Typhus'', 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

In connection with healthcare philosophy, the theory of [[natural rights]] becomes a rather pertinent subject. After birth, man is effectively endowed with a series of natural rights that cannot be banished under any circumstances. One major proponent of natural rights theory was seventeenth-century English political philosopher [[John Locke]]. With regard to the natural rights of man, Locke states,{{quotation|If God's purpose for me on [[Earth]] is my survival and that of my species, and the means to that survival are my life, health, liberty and property — then clearly I don't want anyone to violate my rights to these things.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke/#HumNatGodPur John Locke, "Human Nature and God's Purposes," ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'']&lt;/ref&gt;}} Although partially informed by his [[religion|religious]] understanding of the world, Locke's statement can essentially be viewed as an affirmation of the right to preserve one's life at all costs. This point is precisely where healthcare as a [[human rights|human right]] becomes relevant.

The process of preserving and maintaining one's health throughout life is a matter of grave concern. At some point in every person's life, his or her health is going to decline regardless of all measures taken to prevent such a collapse. Coping with this inevitable decline can prove quite problematic for some people. For [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosopher [[René Descartes]], the depressing and gerontological implications of [[aging]] pushed him to believe in the prospects of [[immortality]] through a wholesome [[faith]] in the possibilities of [[reason]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-modal/#PosHumFre René Descartes, "Possibility and Human Freedom," ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and dying===
{{Further|Euthanasia}}
One of the most basic human rights is the right to live, and thus, preserve one's life. Yet one must also consider the right to die, and thus, end one's life. Often, religious values of varying traditions influence this issue. Terms like "mercy killing" and "assisted suicide" are frequently used to describe this process. Proponents of [[euthanasia]] claim that it is particularly necessary for patients suffering from a terminal illness.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Callahan, "Terminating Life-Sustaining Treatment of the Demented," ''Bioethics'' Ed. John Harris (New York: Oxford University Press, 2001), 93.&lt;/ref&gt; However, opponents of a self-chosen death purport that it is not only immoral, but wholly against the pillars of reason.

In a certain philosophical context, death can be seen as the ultimate [[Existential crisis|existential]] moment in one's life. Death is the deepest cause of a primordial [[anxiety]] (''Die Anfechtung'') in a person's life. In this emotional state of anxiety, "the Nothing" is revealed to the person. According to twentieth-century [[Germans|German]] philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]],{{quotation|The Nothing is the complete negation of the totality of beings.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, "What Is Metaphysics?" ''Basic Writings'' Ed. David Krell (New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 1993), 98.&lt;/ref&gt;}} And thus, for Heidegger, humans finds themselves in a very precarious and fragile situation (constantly hanging over the [[abyss (religion)|abyss]]) in this world. This concept can be simplified to the point where at bottom, all that a person has in this world is his or her [[Being]]. Regardless of how individuals proceed in life, their existence will always be marked by [[wikt:finitude|finitude]] and [[solitude]]. When considering near-death experiences, humans feels this primordial anxiety overcome them. Therefore, it is important for healthcare providers to recognize the onset of this entrenched [[wiktionary:despair|despair]] in patients who are nearing their respective deaths.

Other philosophical investigations into death examine the healthcare's profession heavy reliance on science and technology (SciTech). This reliance is especially evident in Western medicine. Even so, Heidegger makes ang [[allusion]] to this reliance in what he calls the allure or "character of exactness."&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, "What Is Metaphysics?," 94.&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, people are inherently attached to "exactness" because it gives them a sense of purpose or reason in a world that is largely defined by what appears to be [[wikt:chaos|chaos]] and irrationality. And as the moment of death is approaching, a moment marked by utter confusion and fear, people frantically attempt to pinpoint a final sense of meaning in their lives.

Aside from the role that SciTech plays in death, [[palliative care]] constitutes a specialized area of healthcare philosophy that specifically relates to patients who are terminally ill. Similar to [[hospice]] care, this area of healthcare philosophy is becoming increasingly important as more patients prefer to receive healthcare services in their homes. Even though the terms "'''palliative'''" and "'''hospice'''" are typically used interchangeably, they are actually quite different. As a patient nears the end of his life, it is more comforting to be in a private home-like setting instead of a hospital. Palliative care has generally been reserved for those who have a [[terminal illness]]. However, it is now being applied to patients in all kinds of medical situations, including chronic fatigue and other distressing symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capc.org/palliative-care-across-the-continuum/ "Palliative Care across the Continuum" ''Center to Advance Palliative Care'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role development==
The manner in which nurses, physicians, patients, and administrators interact is crucial for the overall efficacy of a healthcare system. From the viewpoint of the patients, healthcare providers can be seen as being in a privileged position, whereby they have the power to alter the patients' quality of life. And yet, there are strict divisions among healthcare providers that can sometimes lead to an overall decline in the quality of patient care. When nurses and physicians are not on the same page with respect to a particular patient, a compromising situation may arise. Effects stemming from a "gender gap" between nurses and doctors are detrimental to the professional environment of a hospital workspace.&lt;ref&gt;Mary W. Stewart, "The Social Context of Professional Nursing," ''Role Development in Professional Nursing Practice'' Ed. Kathleen Masters (Sudbury: Jones and Bartlett Publishers, 2005), 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philosophy of psychedelics''' is the philosophical investigation of the [[psychedelic experience]]. While [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]], [[entheogenic]] or [[hallucinogenic]] substances have been used by many traditional cultures throughout history mostly for religious purposes, recorded philosophical speculation and analysis of these substances, their [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] effects and the relevance of these [[altered states of consciousness]] to philosophical questions is a relatively late phenomenon in the [[history of philosophy]]. Traditional cultures who use psychedelic substances such as the Amazonian and [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|Indigenous Mexican]] peoples hold that ingesting medicinal plants such as [[Ayahuasca]] and [[Peyote]] allows one to commune with the beings of the [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|spirit world]].

==Indian philosophy==
The Indian Yogi and scholar [[Patanjali]] in his Yoga sutras mentions that mystic powers (''siddhaya'') can arise from certain "herbs" or "healing plants"&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Anthony Macdonell, Arthur Berriedale; Vedic Index of Names and Subjects, Volume 1; Volume 5&lt;/ref&gt; (''osadhi''):

:janmauṣadhi-mantra-tapaḥ samādhi jāḥ siddhayaḥ||
:The mystic powers arise due to birth, herbs, [[mantras]], the performance of austerity and [[samadhi]].&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, Edwin F.; The Yoga Sutras of Patañjali: A New Edition, Translation, and Commentary, chapter IV&lt;/ref&gt;

Later commentators on the Yoga sutras like [[Vyasa]] mention elixirs of the [[asuras]], and also state these herbal concoctions can be found in this world. [[Adi Shankara]] meanwhile refers to the Vedic drink [[Soma (drink)|Soma]].&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, Edwin F.; The Yoga Sutras of Patañjali: A New Edition, Translation, and Commentary, chapter IV&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vajrayana]] Buddhist [[Tantras]] mention the nectar "[[amrita]]" (literally "immortal", "deathless") which was drunk during rituals and which is associated in the tradition with 'spiritual intoxication'.&lt;ref&gt;Gimian, Carolyn Rose; The Essential Chogyam Trungpa, Glossary&lt;/ref&gt; A biography of the scholar [[Gampopa]] mentions how one of his teachers stated that "You can obtain [[Buddhahood]]: by taking a medicine pill which will make you immortal like the sun and moon."&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, J. M. The Life of Gampopa, The Incomparable Dharma Lord of Tibet, Snow Lion Publications, Ithaca, N. Y., USA, 1995, page 53.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a reference to the Vajrayana practice of [[rasayana]] (Skt: "alchemy") to create certain potions or pills. According to M.L. Walter's study of Indo-Tibetan rasayana, ingestion of these substances were said to "strengthen the yogin and procure the [[siddhi]] for him, as well as bringing him to the final goal." &lt;ref&gt;Walter, M. L, Preliminary Results from a study of two Rasayana systems in Indo-Tibetan Esoterism published in Tibetan Studies in Honour of Hugh Richardson (M. Aris, ed.), Aris &amp; Phillips Ltd., Warminster, England 1980, page 319&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mike Crowley there are two traditions of Indo Tibetan-rasayana preserved in Tibet, one founded by [[Padmasambhava]] and the other by his contemporary, [[Vimalamitra]].&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Mike; When the Gods Drank Urine A Tibetan myth may help solve the riddle of soma, sacred drug of ancient India, Fortean Studies, vol. III, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Chogyam Trungpa]] (1939 – 1987), a modern teacher is the [[Kagyu]] tradition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;amrita... is used in conferring the second abhisheka, the secret abhisheka. This transmission dissolves the student's mind into the mind of the teacher of the lineage. In general, amrita is the principle of intoxicating extreme beliefs, belief in ego, and dissolving the boundary between confusion and sanity so that coemergence can be realized.&lt;ref&gt;Trungpa, C.; Sacred Outlook: The Vajrayogini Shrine and Practice (in The Silk Route and the Diamond Path, D. E. Klimburg-Salter, editor ), UCLA Art Council, Los Angeles, 1982, page 236&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==19th century==
European literature such as [[Confessions of an English Opium-Eater]] by [[Thomas De Quincey]] (one of the first English commentators on [[Kant]])&lt;ref&gt;Stirling, James Hutchison (1867). "De Quincey and Coleridge Upon Kant," Fortnightly Review, Vol. 8, pp. 377–97.&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s [[Kubla Khan]] described the use and phenomenal character of mind-altering substances such as [[Opium]]. De Quincey held that [[Opium]] allowed one to access the earliest of memories and that therefore no memories were ever truly forgotten:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The minutest incidents of childhood, or forgotten scenes of later years, were often revived: I could not be said to recollect them; for if I had been told of them when waking, I should not have been able to acknowledge them as parts of my past experience. But placed as they were before me, in dreams like intuitions, and clothed in all their evanescent circumstances and accompanying feelings, I recognized them instantaneously […] I feel assured that there is no such thing as forgetting possible to the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Quincey, Thomas de.  Confessions of an English Opium-Eater and Other Writings.London: Penguin Books, 2003, 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jacques-Joseph Moreau, who reported his experiments with mental patients and drugs, believed that “the hashish experience was a way to gain insight into mental disease.”&lt;ref&gt;Nahas, Gabriel G.  Marihuana—Deceptive Weed.  New York: Raven Press, 1973. see: Baudelaire on Drugs : Marijuana Consumption in the Age of Colonialism http://evitanza.bol.ucla.edu/baudelaire.html#_ftn15&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Poet [[Baudelaire]] wrote about the effects of [[Hashish]] and [[Opium]] in [[Les Paradis artificiels]] (1860) and theorized about how they could be used to allow the individual to reach "ideal" states of mind. Charles Baudelaire was member of the '[[Club des Hashischins]]', a Parisian literary group dedicated to the exploration of altered states of consciousness which included literary figures such as [[Victor Hugo]], [[Alexandre Dumas]], [[Gerard de Nerval]], [[Honore de Balzac]], and [[Theophile Gautier]].&lt;ref&gt;Levinthal, C. F. (2012). Drugs, behavior, and modern society. (6th ed.). Boston: Pearson College Div.&lt;/ref&gt; Baudelaire's opinion of the drug was generally negative, believing that it weakened and dampened artistic capacities, the personal Will and even the very identity of the hashish eater. He compared it to suicide and a false happiness, and saw wine as the true intoxicant of the artists.&lt;ref&gt;Vitanza, Baudelaire on Drugs : Marijuana Consumption in the Age of Colonialism&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, [[The Hasheesh Eater]] (1857) an autobiographical book by [[Fitz Hugh Ludlow]] became popular. Ludlow wrote that a [[Marijuana]] user sought "the soul’s capacity for a broader being, deeper insight, grander views of Beauty, Truth and Good than she now gains through the chinks of her cell."&lt;ref&gt;Ludlow, Fitz Hugh "The Visionary", The Hasheesh Eater 1857&lt;/ref&gt; The American [[William James]] was one of the first academic philosophers to write about the effects of hallucinogenic substances in his ''The Subjective Effects of Nitrous Oxide'' (1882) in which he writes that the gas can produce a "tremendously exiting sense of an intense metaphysical illumination. Truth lies open to the view in depth beneath depth of almost blinding evidence. The mind sees all logical relations of being with an apparent subtlety and instantaniety to which its normal consciousness offers no parallel".&lt;ref&gt;James; ''The Subjective Effects of Nitrous Oxide'' (1882), https://erowid.org/chemicals/nitrous/nitrous_article1.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to say that the experience gave him the sense that the philosophy of [[Hegel]] was true. In his ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'' he likewise writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nitrous oxide and ether, especially nitrous oxide … stimulate the mystical consciousness in an extraordinary degree. … [In] the nitrous oxide trance we have a genuine metaphysical revelation. … [Our] normal waking consciousness, rational consciousness as we call it, is but one special type of consciousness, whilst all about it, parted from it by the filmiest of screens, there lie potential forms of consciousness entirely different.&lt;ref&gt;James, William; The Varieties of Religious Experience, ch. XVI&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==20th century==

After using [[mescaline]] in 1953, [[Aldous Huxley]] wrote the [[Doors of Perception]] where he advanced the theory that psychedelic compounds could produce mystical experiences and knowledge, "what the visionary, the medium, even the mystic were talking about" and what eastern philosophy described with terms like [[Satcitananda]], the Godhead, [[Suchness]], [[Shunyata|Void]], [[Anatta|Not-self]] and [[Dharmakaya]].&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, The Doors of Perception&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley also quotes the philosopher [[C. D. Broad]], which held that the brain and nervous might act as a reducing valve of all the stimuli in the universe:

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to such a theory, each one of us is potentially [[Mind at Large]]. But in so far as we are animals, our business is at all costs to survive. To make biological survival possible, Mind at Large has to be funneled through the reducing valve of the brain and nervous system. What comes out at the other end is a measly trickle of the kind of consciousness which will help us to stay alive on the surface of this Particular planet.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, The Doors of Perception&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Huxley wrote that it was possible that certain human beings could, through drugs, meditation, etc. circumvent the 'reducing valve' and experience something far beyond everyday consciousness. This experience Huxley saw as the source of all mysticism, a theory termed the [[Perennial philosophy]]. He also discusses art and the legality of various drugs in the West as well as arguing for the importance for self-transcendence. Huxley's philosophical novel [[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]] also described a Utopian society that used a psychedelic substance for spiritual purposes.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In the early 1960s a group that eventually came to be called "Harvard Psychedelic Club" which included [[Timothy Leary]], [[Huston Smith]] and [[Ram Dass]] administered psychedelics to Harvard students. The group experimented with psychedelics in experiments such as the [[Harvard Psilocybin Project]]. Huston Smith's last work, [[Cleansing the Doors of Perception]], describes the Harvard Project in which he participated.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Ram Dass' [[Be Here Now (book)|Be here now]] and Tim Leary's [[The Psychedelic Experience|The Psychedelic Experience: A Manual Based on The Tibetan Book of the Dead]] compared the psychedelic experiences to [[eastern philosophy]] and mystical states of consciousness. These books further popularized the idea that eastern - particularly Indian philosophical and spiritual insights could be obtained from using psychedelics. One of these experiences described in ''The Psychedelic Experience'' is that of [[ego death]] or depersonalization.{{full citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The idea that the psychedelic experience could grant access to eastern spiritual insights was also promoted by the popular philosopher [[Alan Watts]] in his writings such as ''The Joyous Cosmology'', who also argued that one should not remain dependent on them for spiritual growth: "If you get the message, hang up the phone. For psychedelic drugs are simply instruments, like microscopes, telescopes, and telephones. The biologist does not sit with eye permanently glued to the microscope, he goes away and works on what he has seen."&lt;ref&gt;The Joyous Cosmology: Adventures in the Chemistry of Consciousness (the quote is new to the 1965/1970 edition (page 26), and not contained in the original 1962 edition of the book).&lt;/ref&gt;

Various psychologists during the 1960s also studied psychedelic substances and worked with [[Psychedelic therapy]] and later developed various theories about their effects and significance. [[Stanislav Grof]] is known for his extensive work in LSD psychotherapy and for developing a theory which stated that the psychedelic experience allowed one to relive birth trauma and to explore the depths of the unconscious mind. Grof observed four levels of the LSD experience, which for him correspond to areas of the human unconscious: (1) Abstract and aesthetic experiences (2) Psychodynamic experiences (3) Perinatal experiences, and (4) Transpersonal experiences. Grof defined the last level as "experiences involving an expansion or extension of consciousness beyond the usual ego boundaries and beyond the limitations of time and/or space."&lt;ref&gt;PSYPRESSUK CONTRIBUTORS; Realms of the Human Unconscious by Stanislav Grof PUBLISHED JANUARY 19, 2011 · UPDATED FEBRUARY 5, 2015, http://psypressuk.com/2011/01/19/literary-review-realms-of-the-human-unconscious-by-stanislav-grof/&lt;/ref&gt; The field of [[Transpersonal psychology]] focuses on this type of experience. Grof included topics such as consciousness, mysticism and metaphysics in his later writings.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The scientist and philosopher [[John C. Lilly]] discussed his experiments with psychedelics and [[altered states of consciousness]] in [[The Center of the Cyclone: An Autobiography of Inner Space]] and Programming and Metaprogramming in the Human Biocomputer. Other psychologists who studied and wrote on psychedelic use include [[Walter Pahnke]], [[Ralph Metzner]] and [[Claudio Naranjo]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

According to writer James Oroc, the 1990s brought about a second phase in modern psychedelic culture. The 'philosophical foundation' of this new wave of psychedelic thought was based on the works of [[Alexander Shulgin]], [[Alex Grey]] and [[Terence McKenna]].&lt;ref&gt;Oroc, James; The Second Psychedelic Revolution, http://realitysandwich.com/216613/the-second-psychedelic-revolution-part-one-the-end-of-acid/&lt;/ref&gt;

Neuroscientist [[Rick Strassman]] has written about his research into the psychedelic [[N,N-Dimethyltryptamine]] in his book ''DMT: The Spirit Molecule'' (2001). In his book Strassman investigates the possible connection between natural DMT in mystical and [[Near Death Experiences]] and psychedelic states caused by outwardly administered DMT. He also describes the psychedelic experiences of the volunteers in his experiments and their encounter with certain strange "beings" after being administered DMT.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In his study of recent scientific research on psychedelics and its [[neurophilosophy]] (''Neuropsychedelia'', 2012), Nicolas Langlitz has argued that Huxley's view expressed in the Doors of perception of the brain as a "reducing valve" which when released produced a perennial mystical experience has been a very influential theory among contemporary psychopharmacologists who study psychedelics, who have given it a materialist 'neurobiological reinterpretation' which he calls “mystic materialism”.&lt;ref&gt;Langlitz; Nicolas; IS THERE A PLACE FOR
PSYCHEDELICS IN PHILOSOPHY? Fieldwork in Neuro- and Perennial Philosophy, http://www.nicolaslanglitz.de/nicolaslanglitz.de/Texts_files/Langlitz%202016%20-%20IS%20THERE%20A%20PLACE%20FOR%20PSYCHEDELICS%20IN%20PHILOSOPHY%3F.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Langlitz defines this as: "a this-worldly mysticism that reveres not transcendence but biological life" and holds to a certain "metaphysical unity of the world".&lt;ref&gt;ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Metzinger]] has discussed the effects of substances such as LSD, dimethyltryptamine, and mescaline in his ''Being No One'' (2003). Metzinger describes the hallucinatory component of the psychedelic experience as "epistemically vacuous" i.e. it provides no [[epistemic]] knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Langlitz; Nicolas; IS THERE A PLACE FOR
PSYCHEDELICS IN PHILOSOPHY? Fieldwork in Neuro- and Perennial Philosophy, http://www.nicolaslanglitz.de/nicolaslanglitz.de/Texts_files/Langlitz%202016%20-%20IS%20THERE%20A%20PLACE%20FOR%20PSYCHEDELICS%20IN%20PHILOSOPHY%3F.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, Metzinger still believes that philosophers and consciousness researchers would have much to gain if they were "well traveled in phenomenal state space, if they were cultivated in terms of the richness of their own inner experience" through the psychedelic experience.&lt;ref&gt;ibid&lt;/ref&gt; According to Metzinger, psychedelic experiences could change researchers' theoretical intuitions as well as serving as a form of 'mental culture', an analogue to [[Physical culture]].&lt;ref&gt;ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

The American philosopher [[Sam Harris]] has discussed his use of psychedelics in his book [[Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion]] which also attempts to argue for a [[spiritual naturalism|naturalized spirituality]].

Another contemporary philosopher write about psychedelics is Peter Sjöstedt-H. His recent ''Noumenautics'' (2015) discusses psychedelic phenomenology and its metaphysical implications. 

In his encyclopedic overview of psychedelic culture and thought ''Psychedelia'' (2012), [[Patrick Lundborg]] developed a psychedelic philosophy he called "Unified Psychedelic Theory" (UPT) which draws from [[Platonism]], the phenomenology of [[Husserl]] and [[Merleau-Ponty]], [[Paul D. MacLean]]'s [[Triune brain]] theory, the work of [[Eugen Fink]] and other thinkers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1975">'''Reconstructivism''' is a [[philosophical theory]] holding that societies should continually reform themselves in order to establish more perfect governments or [[social network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.articleworld.org/index.php/Reconstructivism |title=Articleworld.org |accessdate=2008-04-26 |format=php |work=Reconstructivism }}&lt;/ref&gt; This ideology involves recombining or [[Recontextualisation|recontextualizing]] the ideas arrived at by the philosophy of [[deconstruction]], in which an existing system or medium is broken into its smallest meaningful elements and in which these elements are used to build a new system or medium  free from the strictures of the original.

Some thinkers have attempted to ascribe the term Reconstructivism to the post-postmodern art movement. In an essay by Chris Sunami, ([http://kitoba.com/pedia/Reconstructivist+Art.html Art Essays: Reconstructivist Art]) "reconstructivist art" is described as follows:

{{quote|A reconstructivist art work builds upon prior, [[deconstructionist]] artworks and techniques, but adapts them to classic themes and structures, with the goal of creating works of genuine emotion and significance. In this way, reconstructivism (when it works) combines the vitality and originality of deconstructionism with the comforts, pleasures and rewards of [[classicism]]. The overall purpose of reconstructivism is to reawaken a sense of the Real in a world where everything has been demonstrated to be an illusion.}}

One of the examples Sunami provides of this technique is the way some modern music incorporates deconstructed samples of older music and combines and arranges the samples in a new way as part of a new composition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18886">'''Reflectivism''' is a broad [[Umbrella term|umbrella label]], used primarily in [[International relations theory|International Relations theory]], for a range of theoretical approaches which oppose [[Rational choice|rational-choice]] accounts of social phenomena and, perhaps, [[positivism]] more generally.  The label was popularised by [[Robert Keohane]] in his presidential address to the [[International Studies Association]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;The attribution to Keohane is standard -- see e.g. Milja Kurki, ''Causation in International Relations: Reclaiming Causal Analysis''.  Cambridge University Press (2008), p. 124 n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The address was entitled "International Institutions: Two Approaches", and contrasted two broad approaches to the study of [[international institution]]s (and international phenomena more generally).  One was "rationalism", the other what Keohane referred to as "reflectivism".  Rationalists — including [[Realism (international relations)|realists]], [[Neorealism (international relations)|neo-realists]], [[Liberalism (international relations)|liberals]], [[Neoliberalism in international relations|neo-liberals]], and scholars using [[Game theory|game-theoretic]] or [[Expected utility|expected-utility]] [[Economic model|models]] — are theorists who adopt the broad theoretical and [[ontological]] commitments of [[Rational choice theory|rational-choice theory]].

== Rationalism vs. reflectivism ==
Keohane characterised rationalism in the following fashion:

:[Rationalists accept] what [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] has referred to a "substantive" conception of rationality, characterizing "behaviour that can be adjudged objectively to be [[Optimal decision|optimally]] adapted to the situation" (Simon, 1985:294).  As Simon has argued, the principle of [[Decision-making models#Rationality|substantive rationality]] generates hypotheses about actual human behaviour only when it is combined with certain [[Duhem–Quine thesis|auxiliary]] [[Scientific theory#Assumptions in formulating theories|assumptions]] about the structure of [[utility function]]s and the formation of expectations.

:Since this research program is rooted in [[exchange theory]], it assumes [[scarcity]] and competition as well as [[rationality]] on the part of the actors.  Rationalistic theories of [[institution]]s view institutions as affecting patterns of [[Cost#Comparing private, external, social, and psychic costs|costs]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert O. Keohane, "International Institutions: Two Approaches", ''International Studies Quarterly'' 32, 4 (Dec. 1988), pp. 381, 386.&lt;/ref&gt;

Keohane went on to contrast this with the approach of "reflective" scholars:
:These authors, of whom the best-known include [[Hayward Alker]], [[Richard K. Ashley|Richard Ashley]], [[Friedrich Kratochwil]], and [[John Ruggie]], emphasize the importance of the "[[Intersubjectivity|intersubjective]] meanings" of international institutional activity (Kratochwil and Ruggie, 1986:765).  In their view, understanding how people think about institutional [[Social norms|norms]] and rules, and the [[discourse]] they engage in, is as important in evaluating the significance of these norms as measuring the behavior that changes in response to their invocation.

:These writers emphasize that individuals, local organizations, and even states develop within the context of more encompassing institutions.  Institutions do not merely reflect the [[Preference (economics)|preferences]] and power of the units constituting them; the institutions themselves shape those preferences and that power.  Institutions are therefore constitutive of actors as well as vice versa.  It is therefore not sufficient in this view to treat the preferences of individuals as given [[exogenous]]ly: they are affected by institutional arrangements, by prevailing norms, and by historically contingent discourse among people seeking to pursue their purposes and solve their self-defined problems.

:[I]t would be fair to refer to them as "[[Verstehen|interpretive]]" scholars, since they all emphasize the importance of historical and textual interpretation and the limitations of [[Scientific modelling|scientific models]] in studying world politics. But other approaches also have a right to be considered [[Antipositivism|interpretive]]. I have therefore coined a phrase for these writers, calling them "reflective", since all of them emphasize the importance of human reflection for the nature of institutions and ultimately for the character of world politics.&lt;ref&gt;Keohane, "International Institutions", pp. 381-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflectivism and rationalism are typically used as labels applying not just to the study of international institutions, but of international relations more widely, and even the social world as a whole.  Sociologies and histories of the International Relations discipline have sometimes used the opposition between these approaches to describe one of the central fault-lines within the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Ole Waever, "The Rise and Fall of the Inter-Paradigm Debate", in Steve Smith, Ken Booth and Marysia Zalewski (eds.), ''International Theory: Positivism and Beyond''.  Cambridge University Press (1996), pp. 164-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reflexivity ==
There may be another sense, not specifically discussed by Keohane, in which the label is apt. Reflectivist scholars tend to emphasise the inherent [[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]] both of theory and of the social world it studies.  Unlike the term ''reflectivism'', the concept of [[Reflexivity (social theory)|"reflexivity"]] has wide currency outside of international relations, having come to prominence in [[social theory]] in the latter part of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Prominent early works in social theory developing the theme of reflexivity include Anthony Giddens, ''The Constitution of Society: Outline of the Theory of Structuration''.  Polity (1984); [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and Loïc Wacquant, ''An Invitation to Reflexive Sociology''.  University of Chicago Press (1992); and Ulrich Beck, ''Risk Society: Towards a New Modernity''.  SAGE (1992 [1986]).&lt;/ref&gt; Reflexivity refers to the ways in which elements and phenomena in social life have the capacity to "fold in on", or be "directed towards", themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Similar imagery is used by Matthew Eagleton-Pierce, "Examining the Case for Reflexivity in International Relations: Insights from Bourdieu", ''Journal of Critical Globalisation Studies'' 1 (2009), p. 111–12.  Another explicit analysis of reflexivity in IR, also inspired by the social theory of Pierre Bourdieu, is Anna Leander, "Do We Really Need Reflexivity in IPE? Bourdieu's Two Reasons for Answering Affirmatively", ''Review of International Political Economy'' 9, 4 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; That is, they can produce effects on, or have implications for, their own features, dynamics and existence. An example is the "[[self-fulfilling prophecy]]" (or "self-disconfirming prophecy")&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Ido Oren, "Can Political Science Emulate the Natural Sciences? The Problem of Self-Disconfirming Analysis", ''Polity'' 38, 1 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; — a situation in which merely describing, predicting, imagining or believing something to be the case may eventually result in its actually coming to be the case.&lt;ref&gt;In IR, see e.g. David Patrick Houghton, "The Role of Self-Fulfilling and Self-Negating Prophecies in International Relations", ''International Studies Review'' 11, 3 (2009); Robert Jervis, ''System Effects: Complexity in Political and Social Life''.  Princeton University Press (1997), pp. 60, 148–50.&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, reflectivists emphasise the significance of human [[self-awareness]]: the ways people observe, imagine, describe, predict and theorise about themselves and the social reality around them, and the [[wikt:recursive|recursive]] effect this "self-knowledge" or these "reflections" have on that social reality itself.  Some scholars link reflexivity with [[Structure and agency|the broader debate]], within International Relations theory and social theory more generally, over the relationship between "[[Agency (sociology)|agency]]" and "[[Social structure|structure]]" in the social world.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Kate O'Neill, Jörg Balsiger and Stacy VanDeveer, "Actors, Norms and Impact: Recent International Cooperation Theory and the Influence of the Agent-Structure Debate", ''Annual Review of Political Science'' 7 (2004); Alexander Wendt, "The Agent-Structure Problem in International Relations Theory", ''International Organization'' 41, 3 (1987), p. 359; Daniel Mügge, "Reflexivity in Global Finance: How Agency Matters to Market Change", GARNET Working Paper #14/07 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the relationship between people's capacity to "freely" choose their actions and/or to "make a real difference" to the world around them, and the social "[[Social structure|structures]]" in which people are always embedded, and which may powerfully shape – often against their will or in ways they are unaware of – the kinds of things they are able to do.

Reflectivists also often claim that studying and ''theorising'' about international relations can be, should be, and are necessarily, reflexive. For one thing, they claim, theories about social reality may affect – might change – social reality itself.&lt;ref&gt;A point emphasised, among many others, by Brent J. Steele, ''Ontological Security in International Relations: Self-Identity and the IR State''.  Routledge (2008), pp. 150, 160-64 and passim.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics of (neo-)realism have raised the possibility that realist theories, for instance, may act as [[Self-fulfilling prophecy|self-fulfilling prophecies]].  To the extent that they are taken by theorists and practitioners to be the "common sense" of international politics, diplomacy and policy-making, those theories may encourage precisely the kind of mistrust, ruthless competition and amorality that they posit to be natural and inherent features of the international realm.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Annette Freyburg-Inan, ''What Moves Man: The Realist Theory of International Relations and Its Judgment of Human Nature''. SUNY Press (2003); Alexander Wendt, ''Social Theory of International Politics''.  Cambridge University Press (1999), pp. 368-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Familiar methodological examples of the capacity of observation and theorising to affect the object/phenomena of study include the "[[observer-expectancy effect]]" and long-running concerns among anthropologists and ethnographers over the possible effect of [[Participant observer#Impact of researcher involvement|participant observation]] on the very people and behaviours being studied.

Furthermore, reflectivists argue, those theories invariably reflect in important ways the social context in which they were produced; so in a sense the social world shapes the theories made of it.&lt;ref&gt;One detailed empirical study is Ido Oren, ''Our Enemies and Us: America's Rivalries and the Making of Political Science''.  Cornell UP (2003); see also Oren, "Is Culture Independent of National Security? How America's National Security Concerns Shaped 'Political Culture' Research", ''European Journal of International Relations'' 6, 4 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; There is often a [[normative]] or ethical aspect to the emphasis on reflexivity.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Brooke Ackerly and Jacqui True, "Reflexivity in Practice: Power and Ethics in Feminist Research on International Relations", ''International Studies Review'' 10, 4 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Reflectivists often argue that theorists should be as self-aware as possible — to reflect as much as possible on the influences ([[Presupposition|assumptions]], [[bias]]es, normative commitments, etc.) that feed into and shape the theories they produce.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Mark Neufeld, "Reflexivity and International Relations Theory", ''Millennium'' 22, 1 (1993), p. 55ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, they should be able to [[Reflexivity (social theory)#Overview|hold their own theories]] to the standards and arguments they set out in those same theories.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Inanna Hamati-Ataya, "The 'Problem of Values' and International Relations Scholarship: From Applied Reflexivity to Reflexivism", ''International Studies Review'' 13, 2 (2011); Christian Büger, "Paradigms, Cultures and Translations: Seven Ways of Studying the Discipline of International Relations", paper presented at the Annual Convention of the International Studies Association, Chicago (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; And finally, they should reflect on the likely and possible effects of their theorising.  Some reflectivists (e.g. those of a [[Poststructuralism|post-structuralist]] persuasion) have argued that theorising should itself be understood as a [[Practice (social theory)|practice]], like the human practices that theories study; that it is an act (conscious or unconscious) of intervention into social reality, and that as such it is never "innocent" or "neutral", and there is a degree of responsibility for its consequences that theorists cannot (and should not try to) escape.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Marysia Zalewski, "'All These Theories yet the Bodies Keep Piling Up': Theories, Theorists, Theorising", in Smith, Booth and Zalewski (eds.), ''International Theory: Positivism and Beyond'', pp. 340-53; Steve Smith, "Singing Our World into Existence: International Relations Theory and September 11", ''International Studies Quarterly'' 48, 3 (2004); Jack Amoureux and Brent Steele, ''Reflexivity and International Relations''. Routledge Press (2016); Jack Amoureux, ''A Practice of Ethics for Global Politics: Ethical Reflexivity''. Routledge Press (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reflectivism and post-positivism ==
Reflectivist approaches include such approaches as [[Constructivism (international relations)|constructivism]], [[Feminist theory|feminism]], [[Poststructuralism|post-structuralism]], [[Postcolonialism|post-colonialism]] and [[Critical Theory]].  The challenge launched by these approaches against rationalist approaches, which have largely dominated the IR discipline for the past three decades, was linked to the "Third Debate in International Relations"&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Lapid, "The Third Debate: On the Prospects of International Theory in a Post-Positivist Era", ''International Studies Quarterly'' 33, 3 (Sept. 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; between [[Positivism|positivists]] and [[Postpositivism|post-positivists]]/[[Antipositivism|anti-positivists]]. (The first two disciplinary "Great Debates" are supposed to have pitted (1) [[Realism (international relations)|realists]] vs. so-called "[[Idealism in international relations theory|idealists]]", and (2) [[Behavioralism|behaviouralists]] vs. so-called "traditionalists", the latter favouring historical methods and insights from [[political philosophy]].) Although the large majority of reflectivists oppose [[Positivism#Positivism in science today|positivism]], it might be a mistake to equate reflectivism with post-positivism or anti-positivism, as [[Constructivism (international relations)#Recent developments|(conventional) constructivists]] who are positivist in orientation would nevertheless fall under Keohane's description.  Confusion may be compounded by the fact that in International Relations theory, rationalism&lt;ref&gt;On which, see e.g. Miles Kahler, "Rationality in International Relations", ''International Organization'' 52, 4 (Autumn 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; and positivism can often be (erroneously) equated.&lt;ref&gt;That positivism and rationalism are not synonymous is noted e.g. by Milja Kurki and Colin Wight, "International Relations and Social Science", in Timothy Dunne, Milja Kurki and Steve Smith (eds.), ''International Relations Theories: Discipline and Diversity''.  Oxford University Press (2007), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many positivist political scientists who do not adopt [[Rational choice theory|rational-choice]] assumptions.

Some mainstream International Relations scholars, dismissing the importance or value of non-positivist approaches to social science, have reframed the rationalism-reflectivism debate narrowly, as a debate between [[Rationalist-constructivist debate|rationalism and ("conventional") constructivism]], construed as the two major [[Social theory|social theories]] (or "[[Ontology|ontologies]]") of (mainstream) International Relations theory. The rationalism-constructivism debate drew considerable attention within the mainstream at the turn of the 21st century, with some rejecting the starkness of the opposition itself and asserting a fundamental compatibility, or possibility of synthesis, between the two approaches.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. James Fearon and Alexander Wendt, "Rationalism v. Constructivism: A Skeptical View", in Walter Carlsnaes, Thomas Risse and Beth Simmons (eds.), ''Handbook of International Relations'', 1st edn. SAGE (2002), pp. 52-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of reflectivist approaches==
The main criticisms of reflectivist approaches stem from the [[epistemology|epistemological]] differences between reflectivism and what in the social sciences has come to be known as [[positivism]]. Since the 1970s, mainstream International Relations theory has become increasingly, and more insistently, positivist in epistemological orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Maliniak, Amy Oakes, Susan Peterson and Michael J. Tierney, "The International Relations Discipline, 1980-2006", paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Political Science Association, Chicago (2007), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The typical reflectivist rejection of positivist assumptions and methods has led to criticism that the approach cannot make reliable statements about the outside world and even that it has repudiated the entire "social science enterprise".&lt;ref&gt;In reference to "postmodernism", for example, see Peter Katzenstein, Robert Keohane and Stephen Krasner, "International Organization at Fifty: Exploration and Contestation in the Study of World Politics", ''International Organization'' 52, 4 (Autumn 1998), p. 678.&lt;/ref&gt; Such criticisms are widespread in American political science, and reflectivism is not generally popular in U.S.-based IR scholarship, especially when compared with scholarship originating in Europe and the third world.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Ole Waever, "The Sociology of a Not So International Discipline:  American and European Developments in International Relations", ''International Organization'' 52, 4 (1998); Thomas Biersteker, "The Parochialism of Hegemony:  Challenges for 'American' International Relations", in Arlene Tickner and Ole Waever (eds.), ''International Relations Scholarship Around the World:  Worlding Beyond the West''.  Routledge (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''self-indication assumption''' ('''SIA''')&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Nick Bostrom originally used the term SIA in a slightly different way. What is here referred to as SIA, he referred to as the combined SSA+SIA&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[philosophical]] principle defined by [[Nick Bostrom]] in his book ''[[Anthropic Bias: Observation Selection Effects in Science and Philosophy]]''. It states that:

:All other things equal, an observer should reason as if they are randomly selected from the set of all ''possible'' observers.

Note that "randomly selected" is weighted by the probability of the observers existing: under SIA you are still unlikely to be an unlikely observer, unless there are a lot of them. It is one of the two major schools of anthropic probability, the other being the [[Self-Sampling Assumption]] (SSA).

For instance, if there is a coin flip that on heads will create one observer, while on tails it will create two, then we have three possible observers (1st observer on heads, 1st on tails, 2nd on tails), each existing with probability 0.5, so SIA assigns 1/3 probability to each. Alternatively, this could be interpreted as saying there are two possible observers (1st observer on either heads or tails, 2nd observer on tails), the first existing with probability one and the second existing with probability 1/2, so SIA assigns 2/3 to being the first observer and 1/3 to being the second - which is the same as the first interpretation.

This is why SIA gives an answer of 1/3 probability of heads in the [[Sleeping Beauty Problem]].

Notice that unlike [[Self-Sampling Assumption|SSA]], SIA is not dependent on the choice of reference class, as long as the reference class is large enough to contain all subjectively indistinguishable observers. If the reference class is large, SIA will make it more likely, but this is compensated by the much reduced probability that the agent will be ''that particular agent'' in the larger reference class.

Although this [[anthropic principle]] was originally designed as a [[Self-Indication Assumption Doomsday argument rebuttal|rebuttal]] to the [[Doomsday argument]] (by [[Dennis Dieks]] in 1992) it has general applications in the philosophy of [[anthropic reasoning]], and Ken Olum has suggested it is important to the analysis of [[quantum cosmology]].

Ken Olum has written in defense of the SIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ken |last=Olum |url=http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/0009081 |title=The Doomsday Argument and the Number of Possible Observers |journal=Philosophical Quarterly |year=2002 |volume=52 |issue=207 |pages=164–184 |doi=10.1111/1467-9213.00260|arxiv=gr-qc/0009081 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nick Bostrom]] and [[Milan Cirkovic]] have critiqued this defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Nick Bostrom and Milan Cirkovic |url=http://www.anthropic-principle.com/preprints/olum/sia.pdf |title=The doomsday argument and the self-indication assumption: reply to Olum |journal=Philosophical Quarterly |year=2003 |volume=53 |issue=210 |pages=83–91 |doi=10.1111/1467-9213.00298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''self-sampling assumption''' ('''SSA'''), one of the two major schools of anthropic probability&lt;ref name="Bostrom"&gt;Nick Bostrom, [https://www.amazon.com/Anthropic-Bias-Observation-Selection-Philosophy/dp/0415938589 Anthropic Bias: Observation Selection Effects in Science and Philosophy] (New York: Routledge, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; — the other being the [[self-indication assumption]] (SIA) — states that:

: All other things equal, an observer should reason as if they are randomly selected from the set of all ''actually existent'' observers (past, present and future) in their reference class.

For instance, if there is a coin flip that on heads will create one observer, while on tails it will create two, then we have two possible worlds, the first with one observer, the second with two. These worlds are equally probable, hence the SSA probability of being the first (and only) observer in the heads world is 1/2, that of being the first observer in the tails world is 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/4, and the probability of being the second observer in the tails world is also 1/4.

This is why SSA gives an answer of 1/2 probability of heads in the [[Sleeping Beauty problem]].

Unlike SIA, SSA ''is'' dependent on the choice of reference class. If the agents in the above example were in the same reference class as a trillion other observers, then the probability of being in the heads world, upon the agent being told they are in the sleeping beauty problem, is &lt;math&gt;\approx&lt;/math&gt; 1/3, similar to SIA.

SSA may imply the [[doomsday argument]] depending on the choice of reference class. It is often used in [[Anthropic principle|anthropic reasoning]].

Bostrom, in his book ''[[Anthropic Bias: Observation Selection Effects in Science and Philosophy]]'', has suggested refining SSA to what he calls the '''Strong Self-Sampling Assumption''' (SSSA), which replaces "observers" in the SSA definition by "observer-moments". This coincides with the intuition that an observer who lives longer has more opportunities to experience herself existing, and it provides flexibility to refine reference classes in certain thought experiments in order to avoid paradoxical conclusions.&lt;ref name="Bostrom" /&gt;

'''Uma Narayan''' (born 16 April 1958) is an [[Feminism in India|Indian feminist scholar]], and a Professor of Philosophy at [[Vassar College]]. 

== Career ==
She is the author of ''Dislocating Cultures: Identities, Traditions and Third World Feminism'' in which Narayan disputes feminism as a solely Western notion and intrusion, while challenging assumptions that [[India]]n feminism is based on Western models. Particularly, a notion of homogeneous, total culture is criticized through historical contextualization of nationalist uses and defenses of the Indian practices of ''[[Sati (practice)|sati]]'' and [[Dowry death|dowry murders]], as well as [[Indian cuisine|food]]. The charges of "Westernization" on Indian feminism, based on the a-historical premises contradicted by her historical contextualization, are thus rejected by Narayan. Likewise, this historicization of the condition of Indian women is used to criticize [[Radical feminism|radical feminist]] claims that all women everywhere are constituted by the same concerns and interests. These arguments align her with theorists such as [[Chandra Talpade Mohanty|Chandra Mohanty]] and [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak|Gayatri Spivak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grewal|first=Gurleen|date=2001|title=Dislocating Cultures: Identities, Traditions, and Third-World Feminism (review)|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/14155|journal=Hypatia|language=en|volume=16|issue=1|pages=102–106|doi=10.1353/hyp.2001.0007|issn=1527-2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Related to her work in ''Dislocating Cultures'', Narayan has criticized culture-reductionist forms of postcolonial feminism which "in attempting to take seriously these  cultural differences...risk replacing gender-essentialist analyses with culturally essentialist analyses that replicate problematic colonialist notions about the cultural differences between 'Western culture' and 'non-Western cultures' and the women who inhabit them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Narayan|first=Uma|date=2000|title=Undoing the "Package Picture" of Cultures|url=|journal=Signs|volume=25|pages=1084|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She dubs this view of culture which covers up divisions and differences within 'Western' and 'non-Western' cultures the "Package Picture of Cultures." This false view can be avoided, for instance, through historical analysis of the culture to be evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Narayan|first=Uma|date=2000|title=Undoing the "Package Picture" of Cultures|url=|journal=Signs|volume=25|pages=1083-86|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

She has also worked in field of Indian legal studies. Her published work includes considerations of [[B. N. Rau|Bengal Narsing Rau]]'s influence on the provisions of the [[Constitution of India]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Narayan|first=Uma|date=2016/11|title=The Constituent Assembly of India: Recollecting Contributions of Sir Benegal Narsing Rau, the Constitutional Adviser|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-legal-information/article/constituent-assembly-of-india-recollecting-contributions-of-sir-benegal-narsing-rau-the-constitutional-adviser/7B51C7FADC06B688CD952F1063BACCAC|journal=International Journal of Legal Information|language=en|volume=44|issue=3|pages=225–234|doi=10.1017/jli.2016.40|issn=0731-1265}}&lt;/ref&gt; and writing primers on Indian legal literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Narayan|first=Uma|date=2007/06|title=Sources of Indian Legal Information|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/legal-information-management/article/sources-of-indian-legal-information/5F315AB8FA3B46BEA41EAFA6690C18AD|journal=Legal Information Management|language=en|volume=7|issue=2|pages=133–139|doi=10.1017/S1472669606001204|issn=1741-2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Narayan coedited ''Reconstructing Political Theory: Feminist Perspectives'' with [[Mary L. Shanley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/36438847|title=Reconstructing political theory : feminist perspectives|date=1997|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|others=Shanley, Mary Lyndon, 1944-, Narayan, Uma.|isbn=0271017244|location=University Park, PA|oclc=36438847}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Having and Raising Children'' with Julia Bartkowiak and ''Decentering the Center: Philosophy for a Multicultural, Postcolonial, and Feminist World'' with [[Sandra Harding]]. She currently is a professor at [[Vassar College]] on the Andrew W. Mellon Chair of Humanities.

== Education ==
Narayan received her B.A. in Philosophy from [[Bombay University]] and her M.A. in Philosophy from [[Pune University]], India. She received her Ph.D. from [[Rutgers University]] in 1990.

[[Image:Ernst Haeckel 2.jpg|thumb|170px|right| [[Ernst Haeckel]] wrote about the ''World Riddle'' in 1895]]

The term "'''world riddle'''" or "'''world-riddle'''" has been associated, for over 100 years, with [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (who mentioned ''Welträthsel'' in several of his writings)
and with the [[biologist]]-[[philosopher]] [[Ernst Haeckel]], who, as a [[professor]] of [[zoology]] at the [[University of Jena]],&lt;ref name=Ha1911&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
wrote the book ''Die Welträthsel'' in 1895&amp;ndash;1899, in modern spelling ''Die Welträtsel'' ([[German language|German]] "The World-riddles"), with the English version published under the title ''The Riddle of the Universe'', 1901.&lt;ref name=Ha1911/&gt;

The term "world riddle" concerns the nature of the universe and the [[meaning of life]].

The question and answer of the World Riddle has also been examined as an inspiration or [[allegory|allegorical meaning]] within some musical compositions, such as the unresolved harmonic progression at the end of ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Also sprach Zarathustra]]'' (1896) by [[composer]] [[Richard Strauss]], made famous in the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

== View of Nietzsche ==
[[Image:FWNietzscheSiebe.jpg|thumb|120px|right| [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].]]

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] referred to the "World Riddle" (''Welträthsel'') in several of his writings; however, his direct influence was limited to a few years, by his failing health.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

== View of Haeckel ==
[[Ernst Haeckel]] viewed the World Riddle as a dual-question of the form, "What is the nature of the physical universe and what is the nature of human thinking?" which he explained would have a single answer since humans and the universe were contained within one system, a mono-system, as Haeckel wrote in 1895:

&lt;/ref&gt;
:: [From ''Monism as Connecting Religion and Science'' by Ernst Haeckel (translated):]
:: "The following lecture on [[Monism]] is an informal address delivered extemporaneously on October 9, 1892, at Altenburg, on the seventy-fifth anniversary of the ''"Naturforschende Gesellschaft des Osterlandes."'' ... The "exacting" [[Berlin]] [[physiologist]] shut this knowledge out from his mind, and, with a short-sightedness almost inconceivable, placed this special [[neurological]] question alongside of the one great "'''world-riddle'''," the fundamental question of substance, the general question of the connection between matter and energy.  As I long ago pointed out, these two great questions are not two separate "'''world-riddles'''." The neurological problem of [[consciousness]] is only a special case of the all-comprehending [[cosmology|cosmological]] problem, the question of substance. "If we understood the nature of matter and energy, we should also understand how the substance underlying them can under certain conditions feel, desire, and think." Consciousness, like feeling and willing, among the higher animals is a mechanical work of the [[ganglion|ganglion-cells]], and as such must be carried back to chemical and physical events in the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] of these.  -Ernst Haeckel, 1895 &lt;ref name=PGmono/&gt;

Haeckel had written that human behavior and feeling could be explained, within the laws of the physical universe, as "mechanical work of the ganglion-cells" as stated.

== View of William James ==
The [[philosopher]] [[William James]] in his book ''[[Pragmatism]]'' (1907) wrote about the world-riddle, as follows:

:: [From ''Pragmatism'' (Lecture VII) by William James:]
:: "All the great single-word answers to the world's riddle, such as God, the One, Reason, Law, Spirit, Matter, Nature, Polarity, the [[Dialectic]] Process, the Idea, the Self, the Oversoul, draw the admiration that men have lavished on them from this oracular role. By amateurs in philosophy and professionals alike, the universe is represented as a queer sort of petrified sphinx whose appeal to man consists in a monotonous challenge to his divining powers. THE Truth: what a perfect idol of the rationalistic mind!"
:::::::::::: --William James, ''Pragmatism'', 1907.&lt;ref name=GutenWJ&gt;
     "The Project Gutenberg EBook of Pragmatism, by William James" (text),
     Project Gutenberg, 2002, Gutenberg.org webpage:
     [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/prgmt10.txt Gutenberg-Pragmatism].
&lt;/ref&gt;

William James has questioned the attitude of thinking that a single answer applies to everything or everyone.  In the passage, the capitalized "THE" signifies the viewpoint meaning "the one and only" [[absolute truth]].

== Emil du Bois-Reymond ==
[[Emil du Bois-Reymond]] used the term "World Riddle" in 1880 for [[Emil_du_Bois-Reymond#The_Seven_World_Riddles|seven great questions]] of science, such as the ultimate nature of matter and the origin of simple sensations. In the lecture to the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy of Sciences]] he declared that neither science nor philosophy could ever explain these riddles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Emil du Bois-Reymond: Neuroscience, Self, and Society in Nineteenth-Century Germany|last=Finkelstein|first=Gabriel Ward|date=2013|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=9780262019507|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/berdiegrenzende07reygoog]
