'''AP Italian Language and Culture''' (or '''AP Italian''') is a course offered by the American [[College Board]] as part of the [[Advanced Placement Program]]. It is intended to give students a thorough background in the [[Italian language]] and [[Culture of Italy|Italian culture]] equivalent to a [[college]]-level course.

Due to low numbers of students taking AP Italian, it was temporarily discontinued after the 2008-2009 year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff|title=College Board Says, 'Arrivederci, AP Italian' |url=https://www.usnews.com/blogs/on-education/2009/01/09/college-board-says-arrivederci-ap-italian-.html|accessdate=14 November 2010|newspaper=U.S. News &amp; World Report|date=9 January 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101105203351/http://www.usnews.com/blogs/on-education/2009/01/09/college-board-says-arrivederci-ap-italian-.html| archivedate= 5 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 3, 2008, [[The Italian Language Foundation]] was established to support Italian language education and the AP Italian program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italianlanguagefoundation.org/history.html |title=History of the AP Italian Program |publisher=Italian Language Foundation |accessdate=14 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224020403/http://www.italianlanguagefoundation.org/history.html |archivedate=24 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On November 10, 2010, the College Board announced that the program would be reinstated in the fall of 2011, with the first AP Italian Exam scheduled for May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lewin|first=Tamar|title=Italian Studies Regains Spot on the List of AP Courses|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/11/education/11italian.html?_r=1|accessdate=14 November 2010|newspaper=New York Times|date=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Course content==
The AP Italian Language and Culture course focuses on developing students' reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills, all framed in order to reflect the richness of Italian language and culture. Teachers of the course will interweave the language structure with cultural content.

==The exam==
The examination tests students' abilities to successfully use three modes of communication: interpersonal, interpretive, and presentational. The five ultimate goals of the exam are communication, culture, connections, comparisons, and community.

==Grade distribution==
In the 2012 administration, 1,806 students took the exam, with a mean score of 3.37. 1,300 students indicated themselves as non-native speakers, who did not use Italian on a regular basis. The mean score for this group was 3.06.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37118">'''[[Academic freedom]] in the Middle East''' is a contested and debated issue, which has caught regional and international attention. In the [[MENA|Middle East and North Africa (MENA)]] region, in general, the authoritarian regimes have all showed a certain degree of opposition to every sort of freedom, academic one not excluded, regardless of the type of regime basis they had. Freedom for academicians to inquiry, research, teach and communicate ideas or report facts without being threatened or persecuted or with the possibility of losing their position, being censored or repressed is threatened. What contributes to academic freedom violations is also that they are essential elements for the regimes to maintain their power and in addition to this issue, interstate and civil wars as well as internal disorders and external intervention can damage educational structures and institutions. Additionally, as far as the regime is concerned, a security or national threat can be a pretest for suffocate or suspend academic research and debate. Restrictions on academic freedom also regards the topics of research, which are under significant constraints, although these might be highly interesting and worth researching.

==Background==
There are many organizations that deal with monitoring violations of academic freedom and report academicians' voices, through publishing letters directed to public figures and also directed to the international community.

===Scholars at Risk===
[[Scholars at Risk]] is an international network based in the United States, specifically at the University of Chicago. The aim of this organization is to support scholars and defend academic freedom and human rights all over the world. One of the projects of this network is the Academic Freedom Monitor.

====Reported cases from Academic Freedom Monitor====
The online website Academic Freedom Monitor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monitoring.academicfreedom.info|title=Home Page - Academic freedom monitor|website=monitoring.AcademicFreedom.info|access-date=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; deals with reporting violations related to academic freedom. It is based on robust sources of information, which come from independent actors and are, then, verified. According to the Academic Freedom Monitor, which reports cases since 2010 until now, there are different categories of violation regarding the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monitoring.academicfreedom.info|title=Home Page - Academic freedom monitor|website=monitoring.academicfreedom.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Regarding the Middle East and Northern Africa, the AFM registers cases in: Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Iran, Lebanon, Syria, Israel, Kuwait, Yemen, Iraq, Palestine (OPT), Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Libya and Tunisia.

==== Types of violations ====
Academic Freedom Monitor identifies different types of violations as following:
* Killings, violence or disappearances
* Wrongful imprisonment/detention
* Wrongful prosecution
* Restrictions on travel or movement
* Retaliatory discharge or loss of position/expulsion from study
* Other significant events&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monitoring.academicfreedom.info/monitoring|title=Monitoring - Academic freedom monitor|website=monitoring.AcademicFreedom.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Committee on Academic Freedom===
[[Middle East Studies Association of North America|The Middle East Studies Association (MESA)]] is an association which brings together scholars and informed people with an interested in the MENA region. This association is the promoter of the ''[[International Journal of Middle East Studies]]'' and has the aim to promote cooperation, communication and boost the learning regarding the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mesana.org/about/index.html|title=About MESA|website=MESANA.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the fields it is dealing with regards academic freedom. This association has created a Committee on Academic Freedom (CAF), which aims to remove any obstacle regarding the exchange of knowledge and any restrictions on academicians coming also from governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mesana.org/committees/academic-freedom/index.html|title=Committee on Academic Freedom (CAF)|website=MESANA.org|access-date=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turkey==
=== History ===
Academic freedom in Turkey has been through a series of changes and fluctuations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Summak, M Semih. “Academic Human Rights and Freedoms in Turkey.” ''The Educational Forum'' 62, no. 1 (1997): 32–39. doi:10.1080/00131729708982678.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often irregular, inadequate and closely tied to the politics in the country.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Weiker, Walter F. “Academic Freedom and Problems of Higher Education in Turkey.” ''Middle East Journal'' 16, no. 3 (1962): 279–94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Balyer, Aydın. “Academic Freedom : Perceptions of Academics in Turkey Akademik Özgürlük : Türkiye ’ Deki Akademisyenlerin Algıları” 36, no. 162 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Norris, Kristin E, Academic Freedom and University Autonomy: A comparative analysis of the Turkish higher education system. (2011). http://hdl.handle.net/1805/2486&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[Education in Turkey#History|reform]] initiatives have been taken throughout Turkey's history which aim at restructuring governance of higher education and thus affecting academic freedom.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Doğan, Didem. “Academic Freedom from the Perspectives of Academics and Students: A Qualitative Study.” ''TeEği̇ti̇m VBi̇li̇m'' 41, no. 184 (2016): 25–32. doi:10.15390/EB.2016.6135.&lt;/ref&gt; The first reform initiative was in 1933, as Malche was invited by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Atatürk]] to restructure [[Istanbul University|Istanbul University (Istanbul Darülfünun)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Üvey, Doðan|author2=Gökçe, Ayse Nur|title="The Role of Prof. Dr. Albert Malche in 1933 university reform in turkey." |journal=Acta - Congressus Historiae Pharmaciae|date=2001|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=1F25595219FD4268916676FA70A746DE?doi=10.1.1.613.7020&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One of the reforms that made it to the law 2252 was according [[List of universities in Turkey|universities]] with more freedom. In 1946, the Law Number 4936 accorded universities with unprecedented rights, as academicians were seen as guardians of democracy second to the military.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
The [[Democrat Party (Turkey, 1946–61)|Democratic Party]] in 1953 passed laws that would undermine the universities' control over their budget, retirement of academicians and their employment rights.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Those attacks on academic freedom were aimed at confining professors from being involved in partisan politics resulting in several cases of suspensions of academicians and denial of promotions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The [[1960 Turkish coup d'état|1960 coup]] was seen as a promise for reversal of the [[Democrat Party (Turkey, 1946–61)|DP]]'s encroachment over university autonomy, as it recruited academicians in government offices, selected to write the constitution and other vital roles. However, the 1960 coup junta surprisingly dismissed 147 academicians who were not in agreement with some members of the junta.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
In 1973, higher education was restructured with the increased sovereignty of the Interuniversity Council (ÜAK), while at the same time universities were given complete autonomy.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== The Council of Higher Education (YÖK) ====
The current Higher Education Law was implemented in 1981 following the [[1980 Turkish coup d'état|1980 coup]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The law maintains that, “universities are judicial structures which are managed and supervised by the organs selected among them. University organs, academics and teaching assistants cannot be removed from their posts for no reason by authorities outside the university” (YÖK 2007).&lt;ref&gt;The Council of Higher Education. ''The Law on Higher Education 1981''. The Republic of Turkey: Official Gazette No: 17506, published in English by Ankara Üniversitesi Basimevi (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Yet academic freedom became too dependent on [[Council of Higher Education (Turkey)|The Council of Higher Education (YÖK)]] as the reform moved towards creating a more centralized system around the YÖK in matters regarding budgetary control, staff employment and student selection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The law defines the name, number and discipline of each faculty or vocational school.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; While universities can establish departments, their approval is subject to the Council.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Egypt==
===History===
Egypt is one of the countries where [[academic freedom]] is not a right freely enjoyed. Since the start of the 1990s, academics in Egypt have faced several forms of repression and endured many violations such as judicial convictions, public condemnation, and physical violence from both private individuals and groups, mainly the Islamists, and government officials.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch 2005, p. 25"&gt;Human Rights Watch. “Reading between the "Red Lines”: The Repression of Academic Freedom in Egyptian Universities.” Vol. 17, No. 6, June 2005, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; On one hand, there are Egyptian state authorities using [[Egyptian National Police|police]], political appointees, and regulations and laws to control university life. On the other hand, Islamist militants are resorting to physical violence and public attacks to have a say in the content of higher education.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch. “Reading between the "Red Lines”: The Repression of Academic Freedom in Egyptian Universities.” Vol. 17, No. 6, June 2005, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;
All aspects of university life including the classroom, student activities, research, campus demonstrations were affected by government and private repression. The professors and students find themselves censored and enable to cross the “red lines” of politics, religion, and sex.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch 2005, p. 25"/&gt;
Faculty appointments and promotions are controlled by the state. Student activities are limited once outside the classroom, and campus protests are often violently responded to. All these factors contribute to the deterioration of the academic freedom situation in Egypt and to the general decline of the educational environment.

====Sisi's era====
While Article 21 of the [[Constitution of Egypt|2014 Egyptian constitution]], issued under [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]]’s rule, ensures that “the state guarantees the independence of universities, scientific and linguistic academies” and that “it commits to providing university education in accordance with global quality criteria, and to developing free university education in state universities and institutes as per the law",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt’s Constitution of 2014|website=Constituteproject.org|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Egypt_2014.pdf|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Egyptian state still violates its constitutional provisions through various repressive ways in an attempt to curb academic freedom. Article 23 of the constitution claims that “the state grants the freedom of scientific research and encourages its institutions.”{{cite web|title=Egypt’s Constitution of 2014|website=Constituteproject.org|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Egypt_2014.pdf|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, freedom of scientific research has often been interfered with and even hindered on various occasions by state authorities. [[Egyptian universities|Universities]] under Sisi’s rule have been described as “experiencing the lowest levels of academic freedom the country has ever known."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Crane Linn, Emily. “Egypt’s Besieged Universities: The Country’s Scholars had better teach from President Sisi’s Textbook- or else.” Foreign Policy. 31 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, many observers maintained that the violations against Egyptian academics under [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi|El-Sisi]]’s rule exceed those witnessed during [[Hosni Mubarak|Mubarak’s]] time. In academic year 2014, 761 student arrests and 281 student expulsions took place.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Moreover, the state sentenced to death a university professor for writing critical articles about the regime and accused him of “conspiring to undermine Egypt’s national security”,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and arrested many others who dared to criticize the regime.
The state also monitors what ideas come in and not just the research that comes out. Several universities are canceling their study abroad programs or breaking off their cooperations with foreign universities. For example, Cairo’s [[Ain Shams University]] canceled its study abroad program to Turkey and [[Damanhour University]] stopped its cooperation with foreign institutions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Furthermore, El-Sisi issued a decree banning any academic travel outside Egypt that does not have a prior [[State Security Investigations Service|State Security]] authorization. This way, the state would be able to control which conferences can be attended and what sources can be used. Even though this decree and many other violations are, according to the articles mentioned above, unconstitutional, they are still enforced.

===Violations===
There are various cases of academic freedom violations in Egypt. The following are just few of them. Professor Kholoud Saber had her scholarship abroad terminated by [[Cairo University]]. She was doing a doctoral research on a scholarship at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|Catholic University of Leuven]] in Belgium, that started on October 2015, when she was ordered to return to Egypt following a recommendation of the [[Ministry of Higher Education (Egypt)|Ministry of Higher education]] in December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. Press Release: “Cairo’s University Decision Demonstrates the Erosion of University Independence and its Reliance on Dictates of Ministry of Higher Education, which acts as a Cover for Security Intervention in Universities.” 10 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Fanny Ohier, a French Master’s student, was arrested and later deported from Egypt. She was working on the [[April 6 Youth Movement]], a group banned by the government as it was accused of state defamation and espionage.&lt;ref name="Risk 2016, p. 13"&gt;Scholars at Risk: Academic Freedom Monitoring Project. “Free to Think: Report of the Scholars at Risk Academic Freedom Monitoring Project.” 2016, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; She was not given any reason for her arrest by the Egyptian officials but she, reportedly, overheard police officers claiming “she had improper friends.”&lt;ref name="Risk 2016, p. 13"/&gt;
On another instance, scholar and journalist Ismail Alexandrani was detained, on November 2015, upon his return Egypt from a workshop in Germany. The Egyptian embassy in Berlin had apparently advised the scholar, who happens to be “a vocal critic of human rights violations in Egypt and counterterrorism policy in the Sinai Peninsula,” not to turn up to the workshop titled “Deconstructing Islamist Egypt"&lt;ref name="Risk 2016, p. 14"&gt;Scholars at Risk: Academic Freedom Monitoring Project. “Free to Think: Report of the Scholars at Risk Academic Freedom Monitoring Project.” 2016, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Mr. Alexandrani’s arrival to Egypt, his passport was confiscated and he was questioned for over 19 hours before getting arrested “on charges of ‘joining and supporting a terrorist organization’ and ‘spreading false news liable to disturb public security and harm public interest."&lt;ref name="Risk 2016, p. 14"/&gt;

===Giulio Regeni case===
One of the most widely covered stories in relation to the situation of academic freedom in Egypt was the case of the Italian PhD candidate [[Giulio Regeni]], a researcher at the [[University of Cambridge]] in the UK. Giulio Regeni was first found dead, in the outskirts of Cairo, a week after he was declared missing on January 25, 2016, which coincided with the fifth anniversary of the [[Egyptian revolution of 2011|Egyptian uprising]], and his body demonstrated clear signs of torture and severe beating.&lt;ref name="scholarsatrisk.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Scholars at Risk: Academic Freedom Monitoring Project. "Free to Think: Report of the Scholars at Risk Academic Freedom Monitoring Project."|date=2016|url=https://www.scholarsatrisk.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Free_to_Think_2016.pdf|format=PDF|website=Scholarsatrisk.org|accessdate=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PhD candidate was investigating the [[Trade unions in Egypt|Egyptian labor movements]] at the [[American University in Cairo|American University of Cairo]] at the time of his murder. While government officials maintained that Regeni was kidnapped and murdered by a gang, international and Egyptian human rights activists claim that he was actually targeted for his research by the Egyptian government.&lt;ref name="scholarsatrisk.org"/&gt;
The murder of Giulio Regeni remains unsolved. 
The case of the researcher, and the continuing imprisonment of hundreds of scholars and thousands of students and the various restrictions on academic freedom signal that there is an actual “not improvement but, rather, a further tightening of control, and loss of autonomy and freedom in Egyptian higher education, as well as a shrinkiHing{{clarify|date=June 2017}} space for critical inquiry and discourse in Egypt generally."&lt;ref name="scholarsatrisk.org"/&gt;

==Israel==
{{POV|date=March 2017}}

=== History ===
In the 1990s, Israeli academia was characterized by open-mindedness and pluralist vision of debated issues such as revisionist history on [[1948 Palestine war|1948 war]] that was finding its way into the academic society.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Struggle for Academic Freedom in Israel|last=Pappe|first=Ilan|publisher=Pluto Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the [[Second Intifada]] and its aftermath, these characteristics gradually vanished also due to the disappearance of [[Israeli Left|Israeli left]] parties, which in fact used to host a great part of Israeli academia and when leftish positions started to change, this influenced the academic environment as well.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Palestinian academia&lt;!-- This sub-section needs some attention. There are many statements made here that are not backed up with secondary sources. For this reason this section reads more like an academic paper than a Wikipedia article. Remember that it is necessary to write from as neutral a position as possible - so every statement you must ask yourself "would someone want to contest this claim?" and if yes ask yourself what you can do to back it up as much as possible. If you cannot find secondary sources for some of these ideas/statements than you need to remove them.   There are several instances in this sub-section where a secondary source is necessary to validate the statement - even if it an event, it must be validated with an external source.  --&gt; ===

In fact, straight after the beginning of the [[first Intifada]], the ability for the students of West Bank Universities to study and carry on theirs studies have been limited, while later on, in 2006, a travel ban to get into Israel was issued for Palestinian students belonging to Israeli universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/ministers-demand-entry-into-israel-for-palestinian-students-1.202733|title=Ministers Demand Entry Into Israel for Palestinian Students|first1=Akiva|last1=Eldar|first2=Yoav|last2=Stern|date=18 October 2006|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; These procedure go along with a series of entry and residence denials for researchers and students, both foreign passport holders and Palestinian-born, which have threatened the ability of carrying on a proper educational and research level in Palestinian universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kibush.co.il/downloads/Letter_from_University_Presidents.pdf|format=PDF|title=To Members of Global Civil Society and Academia|website=Kibush.co.il|access-date=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

[[Human Rights Watch]] reported various violations perpetrated by Israeli authorities on students, in the academic and educational environment. In 2007, 670 students from Gaza were prevented from achieving higher education in countries such as Egypt, Jordan, Germany, Britain and United States, by being denied the exit permits. In total, the number of Gazans who have been denied to exit Gaza has reached 6400 people and this due to Hamas’ takeover of the territory and Israel controlling Gaza’s border. Those students that left for their studies remained once again trapped when they returned home for the summer. Even when they obtained exit permits, students have been stopped at the passenger crossing in [[Erez]], with the justification of “security concerns”.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2007/11/19/gaza-israel-blocks-670-students-studies-abroad|title=Gaza: Israel Blocks 670 Students from Studies Abroad|date=2007-11-19|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2017-03-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2008/06/02/us-challenge-israels-restrictions-gaza-students|title=US: Challenge Israel’s Restrictions on Gaza Students|date=2008-06-02|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2017-03-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, the organization again stated how discrimination by Israeli authorities prevented many Palestinian students from the [[Gaza Strip]] to travel abroad or to the West Bank to get a better education&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch" /&gt;&lt;!-- where are your sources for this? --&gt;. Regarding the chances to travel abroad, in 2008, grants allocated for the Palestinians chosen to study in the United States were redirected because there was no way those students would be allowed by Israel to leave Gaza. For the inability to get visa, the grants destined to Gaza students were transferred to students in the West Bank. The organization has highlighted the necessity and the right for those students to access higher education abroad, since in the Gaza Strip the opportunity are quite limited. For instance, there is not a wide range of degrees, both undergraduate and master’s, in the four available universities. Moreover, there is a total absence of doctoral degrees, and lecturers and teachers from outside are hardly allowed by the Israeli government to enter and teach in Gaza.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2008/06/01/letter-secretary-state-condoleeza-rice-gazan-students|title=Letter to Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice on Gazan Students|date=1 June 2008|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=12 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This blockade is said to be a clear violation of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]], because Israel’s obligation to guarantee the rights of the people under occupation, among which freedom of movement and right to education display, is inconsistent or not committed at all.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch"/&gt; However, according to international law, Gaza is not occupied since Israel no longer has any military presence in Gaza and Gaza has its own, independent government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/11/13/why-gaza-is-not-remotely-occupied-i/|title=Why Gaza is not remotely occupied (I)|first=Eugene|last=Kontorovich|date=13 November 2014|publisher=|access-date=18 December 2017|via=www.WashingtonPost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Israeli academia ===
{{Details|topic=academic freedom and Israeli academia|Academic boycott of Israel|Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions|Ilan Pappé}}
Other types of restrictions regarding [[academic freedom]] affects also Israeli scholars, such as [[Ilan Pappé|Ilan Pappe]], an Israeli Jew, who has been forced to resign for the [[University of Haifa]] in 2007 for his academic work and political positions, such as academic boycott of Israel. The scholar started researching on the history of the creation of the state of Israel and elaborated a revisionist historical perspective regarding 1948 war. He received along with his family death threats.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

In an interview with [[Ma'an News Agency|Ma’an News]], in February 2014, he was asked about academic freedom in Israel and especially regarding his personal experience. This is what he stated:

“Freedom of academic expression in Israel is a bit like the idea of a Israel being a Jewish democracy. You take a universal concept -- everyone has the right to their opinion and everyone has the right to be part of a democracy -- only with one condition: that the universality does not include critique on Zionism and that the democracy would always ensure Jewish majority whatever the demographic and geographical realities are.”&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?ID=664867|title=Interview: Ilan Pappe on academic freedom in Israel and BDS|website=Maan News Agency|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iran ==
=== History ===
During the years that followed the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 Iranian revolution]], hundreds of academicians and students were killed as a consequence of a highly violent campaign that aimed to repress academic freedom, silence dissent, and enforce uniformity of thought.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Sheehan, Ivan Sascha. “Iran’s Assault on Academic Freedom.” ''The Hill''. November 9, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The freedoms of speech, association, and peaceful assembly of thousands of students and faculty members were breached through various methods of brutality, torture and detention. The reasons behind the arrests and torture ranged from “participating in illegal gatherings”, “propaganda against the system”, to “insulting the supreme leader or government officials.”&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Other tens of thousands of students and faculty members were forced out of their education and careers and into exile.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; These assaults on academic freedom continued all throughout the 1980s and became a salient feature of the newly established republic. Paradoxically, it was in universities where the initial revolutionary ‘texts’, aimed to oust the Shah, were produced and circulated.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Indeed, universities came to represent the de facto ‘spaces’ where open-ended critical discourse was taking place. Nevertheless, they became the primary target of attack after the fall of the monarchy and the rise of [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]] to power.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==== Contemporary Era ====
A merciless{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=December 2017}} campaign of repression has been waged by the Iranian authorities against [[academic freedom]] during the last three decades. Academics and students were routinely detained, harassed and expelled from universities because of their beliefs, political affiliations and peaceful activism.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Amnesty International. “Persecution in Universities as Iran ‘squeezes the life out of’ academic freedom.” ''Amnesty.org.'' June 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of coercion and repressive methods was stepped up after the election of President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The latter attempted to ‘Islamize’ the educational curriculum through purging it from secular and ‘Western’ influences. Furthermore, a large number of students and academics were barred from universities, following a policy of “starring” that punished those who do not conform to the state's political and social views. The government of President Ahmadinejad also introduced a quota system to limit the number of women in universities and measures to prevent them from enrolling in a list of courses considered more appropriate for men.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; A firm iron grip was retained over academic institutions by the Iranian authorities to the degree of allowing intelligence bodies and state security to supervise disciplinary proceedings in universities.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The next president who assumed office in 2013, [[Hassan Rouhani]]—considered by many as a ‘reformist’-, made some steps to permit the return of several banned academics and students to campuses.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Nonetheless, the situation of academic freedom remained critical with hundreds of students still imprisoned and others newly arrested since the election of President [[Hassan Rouhani|Rouhani]]. By the end of the academic year under the administration of the latter, various restrictions breaching academic freedom and introduced during the time of President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] remained in place.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Violations ===
Several international instruments, to which Iran is party and accepted, such as the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights ([[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|ICESCR]]), the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ([[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|UDHR]]), and the UNESCO Convention against Discrimination in Education clearly guarantee the right to education to all people without discrimination.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Human Rights Watch. “Iran: Government Assault on Academic Freedom.” ''Human Rights Watch''. May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to that, the rights of individuals to freedoms of association, expression, opinion, and assembly and the prohibition of discrimination based on sex, race, religion, ethnicity or political opinion, are further protected by the International Covenant on Civil and political Rights ([[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|ICCPR]]) and the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination ([[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|CERD]]).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

However, students and academics in Iran still face pervasive and routine infringements of their rights based on gender, religion, ethnicity and opinions. In the period stretching from March 2009 to February 2012, 396 cases of students were reportedly banned from their university programs because of their peaceful activism.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; At least 634 other students were detained by the intelligence and security network.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Student activists were suspended, threatened, arrested and prosecuted on a regular basis due to their peaceful criticism of the regime. Iranian officials have also resorted to shutting down hundreds of student publications, gatherings, and independent organizations.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Moreover, the intelligence and paramilitary agencies are strongly present in university campuses and sometimes violently confront students through attacking peaceful gatherings or dormitories, which often leads to grave injuries and even the death of many students. Furthermore, the minorities living in the republic of Iran are confronted with systematic discrimination and deprivation in universities. One example illustrating this case is that of the Baha’i community who are prevented from pursuing higher education because of their different religious beliefs.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Iranian authorities also specifically punish student activists advocating for ethnic minority rights in harsher ways. The punishments range from violent arrests to heavy sentences including the death sentence. Women are also subject to discrimination at the educational level. The establishment of a quota system to limit female participation in universities is curbing women’s rights. Further restrictions on women’s educational choices are enforced. The issue of gender segregation, which does not always guarantee quality education for women, persists. Academics and teaching personnel are also subject to discrimination with their rights constantly violated. More than a hundred academics were dismissed from universities, because of their dissent against the government and their political views, since the [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|2009 election]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In addition to that, several university professors have been imprisoned for merely expressing peaceful dissent.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== The case of Professor [[Homa Hoodfar]] ===
A Canadian-Iranian professor of anthropology from [[Concordia University]] in Montreal, [[Homa Hoodfar]], was detained in Iran on the 6th of June, 2016.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Bothwell, Ellie. “Professor Imprisoned in Iran: Academic Freedom ‘Not a Western import’.” ''Times Higher Education News''. December 26, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; She was interrogated for three months before being locked in a small cell in [[Evin Prison]] by the Iranian intelligence service.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; [[Evin Prison|Evin prison]] in Iran is referred to as ‘Evin University’ due to the large number of intellectuals detained there.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Professor [[Homa Hoodfar|Hoodfar]] spent 112 days in prison for meddling in affairs of “feminism and security matters.” She was released in September 2016 on “humanitarian grounds” after Canada’s cooperation with officials from Oman, Switzerland and Italy to ensure her release.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Canada worked with the latter countries because it cut its direct diplomatic ties with Iran in 2012.

Professor [[Homa Hoodfar|Hoodfar]] later reported that even though she was not physically abused, the interrogations were severely psychologically distressing.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The questioning would last from 9am to 7pm in a basement, where professor [[Homa Hoodfar|Hoodfar]] would either be facing a wall or a mirror preventing her from seeing her interrogators.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; As examples of psychological abuse, the professor revealed that one day, during questioning, Iranian officials played a song from her husband’s funeral that took place two years before, after they had found a clip of it on her iPad. In another instance, they displayed a picture of “her mother standing at her father’s graveside.”&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

An '''acting workshop''' is  a meeting of actors or others of one specific trade to learn how to hone their skills and to [[social network|network]] with other actors, [[acting coach]]es, and casting directors.  Many actors will critique, mentor, and coach their peers and offer tips on how to improve their preparation for roles, [[audition]]s, and enhance their performing abilities. Acting workshops are often staffed by professionals, which can include acting coaches, directors, or actors. Casting directors sometimes also act as coaches. It is usually recommended that serious actors attend acting workshops to help increase their skill.

==Specialist types==
There are other types of workshops for similar kinds of performance trades. Voice actors learn how to enhance their skill of voicing a character, writers learn to how to give characters personality, and comedians can learn how to increase their comedic skill.  
==Examples==
Specialist independent workshops exist to provide the facilities required for training and providing skills courses. A good example of this is [[Dewar Studios]] in Great Titchfield Street in Central London.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3274">An '''adult educator''' is one who practices the profession of [[Facilitator|facilitating]] the learning of [[adults]] by applying the principles of [[androgogy]].   The broader term of trainer is sometimes used for an adult educator when listing job categories.  However, a trainer is not necessarily an adult educator.  As [[Malcolm Knowles]] proposes, to be a successful adult educator, one must recognize that [[adult learner]]s are self-directed.  That is, they know basically what they need to learn at a given point in their career and seek to engage in the process of their learning through active participation.

==Work==
The adult educator applies the principles of adult learning to the six phases of course development: determining learner needs; writing learning objectives to fulfill those needs; creating a learning plan; selecting learning methodologies geared to the adult learner; implementing the learning plan; and evaluating the degree to which the learning objectives have been met. Central to the creation of the learning plan is the realization of how adults learn most naturally and incorporating that knowledge into every aspect of the practice of [[adult education]].

Adult learners tend to be very [[practical]] learners.  That is, they wish to see the application of their learning almost immediately.  To better insure that this happens, the adult educator must understand the basics of the work, the work [[social environment|environment]] and the challenges facing the adults engaged in that work.  This information is obtained during the needs assessment phase of course development.

Knowles' [[theories]] on adult education were further enhanced by the work of [[David A. Kolb]].  Kolb proposes that adult learners learn through reflective observation, [[abstraction|abstract]] conceptualization, active experimentation, and concrete experience. Kolb recommends that adult educators create learning plans that incorporate the four learning styles so as to make learning more successful.

We see adult educators in many contexts.  They teach adults in [[university]] settings, in [[government organizations]] and in for [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] companies.  When Knowles wrote about adult education in the 1950s, he was referring to the classroom environment. Today with the opportunities presented through elearning, the adult educator can reach adult learners virtually any time, anywhere.

The term is attributed to Malcolm Knowles, an [[United States|American]] educator, who wrote The Modern Practice of Adult Education: From Pedagogy to Androgogy (1980).

Kolb identifies four basic ways adults learn through his studies of how adults take-in (prehend) knowledge and how they apply (transform) knowledge into practice.

The '''Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery''' ('''ASVAB''') is a [[multiple choice]] test, administered by the [[United States Military Entrance Processing Command]], used to determine qualification for [[enlistment]] in the [[United States Armed Forces]]. It is often offered to [[United States|American]] [[Secondary education|high school]] students when they are in the 10th, 11th and 12th grade, though anyone eligible for enlistment may take it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.military.com/ASVAB |title=ASVAB |publisher=Military.com |accessdate=14 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The ASVAB was first introduced in 1968 and was adopted by all branches of the military in 1976. It underwent a major revision in 2002. In 2004, the test's [[percentile]] rank scoring system was [[Normalization (statistics)|renormalized]], to ensure that a score of 50% really did represent doing better than exactly 50% of the test takers.

== Categories ==

=== Current ===
The ASVAB currently contains 9 sections (except the written test, which contains 8 sections). The duration of each test varies from as low as ten minutes up to 36 minutes for Arithmetic Reasoning; the entire ASVAB is three hours long. The test is typically administered in a computerized format at Military Entrance Processing Stations, known as MEPS, or at a satellite location called a Military Entrance Test (MET) site. The ASVAB is administered by computer at the MEPS, while a written version is given at most MET sites. Testing procedures vary depending on the mode of administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.official-asvab.com/whattoexpect_app.htm#|title=What To Expect When You Take the ASVAB|date=19 April 2014|publisher=Department of Defense, Official site of the ASVAB|accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Armed Forces Qualification Test ==
An ''Armed Forces Qualification Test'' (AFQT) score is used to determine basic qualification for enlistment.

AFQT Scores are divided into the following categories

* Category I: 93–99
* Category II: 65–92
* Category III A: 50–64
* Category III B: 31–49
* Category IV A: 21–30
* Category IV B: 16–20
* Category IV C: 10–15
* Category V: 0–9

-The formula for computing an AFQT score is: AR + MK + (2 x VE).

-The VE (verbal) score is determined by adding the raw scores from the PC and WK tests and using a table to get the VE score from that combined PC and WK raw score.

-AFQT scores are not raw scores, but rather percentile scores indicating how each examinee performed compared with the base youth population. Thus, someone who receives an AFQT of 55 scored better than 55 percent of all other members of the base youth population. The highest possible percentile is 99.

-The minimum score for enlistment varies according to branch of service and whether the enlistee has a high school diploma.

GED holders who earn 15 college credits 100 level or greater are considered equivalent with those holding high school diplomas, so that they need only the Tier I score to enlist. Eligibility is not determined by score alone. Certain recruiting goal practices may require an applicant to achieve a higher score than the required minimum AFQT score in order to be considered for enlistment. Rules and regulations are subject to change; applicants should call their local recruiting center for up to date qualification information.&lt;ref name=minimum /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10 Steps to Joining the Military – Step 2: Decide if you're ready|url=http://www.military.com/Recruiting/Content/0,13898,rec_step02_eligibility,,00.html|accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law prohibits applicants in Category V from enlisting.&lt;ref name="10 USC Sec. 520"&gt;10 USC Sec. 520&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are constraints placed on Category IV recruits; recruits in Category IV must be high school diploma graduates but cannot be denied enlistment solely on this criteria if the recruit is needed to satisfy established strength requirements. Furthermore, the law constrains the percentage of accessions who can fall between Categories IV-V (currently, the limit is 20% of all persons originally enlisted in a given armed force in a given fiscal year).&lt;ref name="10 USC Sec. 520" /&gt;

== Composite scores ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}

In addition to the ASVAB's AFQT, each branch has [[military occupational specialty]], or MOS, scores. Combinations of scores from the nine tests are used to determine qualification for a MOS. These combinations are called "aptitude area scores", "composite scores", or "line scores". Each of the five armed services has its own aptitude area scores and sets its own minimum composite scores for each MOS.

== Test validity ==
The AFQT has been used in non-military settings as a proxy measure of intelligence, for example, in Herrnstein &amp; Murray's book ''[[The Bell Curve]]''. Because of the test's significance both inside and outside military settings, it is important to examine what the test measures, i.e. to evaluate the construct validity of the AFQT.  Kaufman's 2010 review stated that [[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]] (2010) scanned the literature for datasets containing test estimates for populations or groups taking both the AFQT and tests of literacy. One study on nine groups of soldiers differing in job and reading ability found a correlation of .96 between the AFQT and reading achievement (Sticht, Caylor, Kern, &amp; Fox, 1972). Another study showed significant improvements among Black and Hispanic populations in their AFQT scores between 1980 and 1992 while Whites only showed a slight decrement (Kilburn, Hanser, &amp; Klerman, 1998). Another study obtained reading scores for 17-year olds for those same ethnic groups and dates (Campbell et al., 2000) and found a correlation of .997 between reading scores and AFQT scores. This nearly perfect correlation was based on six pairs of data points from six independent population samples evaluated by two separate groups of investigators. According to Marks, "On the basis of the studies summarized here, there can be little doubt that the Armed Forces Qualifications Test is a measure of literacy."  However, it is important to note that AFQT has been shown to correlate more highly with classic IQ tests than they do with one another, and that the "crystallized" intelligence measured by AFQT is measured very similarly by [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children|Wechsler]], in particular.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20060619_IQ.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Citywide Educational Coalition''' (CWEC), is a tax-exempt, non-profit educational reform organization whose goal is to provide reliable and objective information on the Boston Public Schools to parents and citizens, enabling citizens to participate in policy making directly and through their school committee and increasing support for public education in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="Boston City Archives"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spalding|first1=Sheila|title=Desegregation-era Records Collection|url=http://www.cityofboston.gov/Images_Documents/Guide%20to%20the%20Desegregation-era%20Records%20collection_tcm3-23340.PDF|publisher=Boston City Archives|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Citywide Education Coalition was created in Boston, Massachusetts in order to create a community agenda for the [[Boston Public Schools]]. Incorporated in 1973 with the mission of circulating clear and accurate information regarding education reform, the Coalition was actively involved in a number of major decisions influencing the Boston School System, including the desegregation of Boston Public Schools.

==Background==

The CWEC was formed in 1972 by Mary Ellen Smith, who brought together parents and concerned citizens from across Boston who felt a need for involvement in the selection of a new superintendent of Boston Public Schools.&lt;ref name=HistNote&gt;{{cite web|last1=Citywide Educational Coalition|title=Citywide Educational Coalition: Historical Note|url=http://www.library.neu.edu/archives/collect/findaids/m130findbioghist.htm|website=Northeastern University Libraries, Archives and Special Collections|publisher=Northeastern University|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group, composed of parents, teachers, school administrators, church groups, community groups and concerned individuals came together around several major issues facing the Boston Public Schools: the search for superintendent, the need to improve quality of education in public schools, the desegregation crisis in Boston and the lack of reliable and accurate information about schools.&lt;ref name=HistNote /&gt; Since its founding, the CWEC has focused its energy on monitoring the implementation of the desegregation order, community organizing around educational issues, representing citizens in areas of educational decision making and on research and public information activities.&lt;ref name=HistNote /&gt;

==Desegregation of Boston Public Schools==
In the 1954 landmark case, [[Brown v. Board of Education]], the legal basis for segregation within public schools is dismantled. The ruling declared that racial segregation violates the rights of United States citizens according to the Constitution, which guarantees equal protection of laws for all American citizens.

Eighteen years later, in 1972, de facto segregation still existed in the Boston Public School System as a result of school districting practices by geographical location, which remained largely segregated within the city. A class action suit was filed on behalf of fifteen parents and forty-three children, with Tallulah Morgan as lead plaintiff, in the case that would come to be known as Morgan v. Hennigan. At that time sixty-eight schools in Boston were racially imbalanced and 30,000 Boston students used public transportation to get to school. In 1974, [[Wendell Arthur Garrity Jr.|Judge W. Arthur Garrity]] sided with the plaintiffs in Morgan vs. Hennigan and stated Boston School Committee had engaged in segregation. Garrity then ordered the school committee to implement the State Board of Education's Racial Imbalance plan until they produced a plan of their own for desegregation. September 12, 1974 marked the first day of school under this new program. The anti-desegregation group Restore our Alienated Rights (ROAR) called for a two-week boycott of schools, which caused a violent reaction, especially in South Boston, and left eighteen school buses damaged citywide.&lt;ref name="Boston City Archives"/&gt;

During this time, members of the Citywide Educational Coalition (CWEC) shifted focus to support the needs of the Boston school system, as well as its students and parents during this unstable period. By disseminating accurate information to parents through the Rumor Control Center and its newsletters, reports and parent guides, the Coalition actively participated in the desegregation of Boston schools.&lt;ref name=HistNote /&gt; Throughout this volatile process, the Coalition developed safety procedures in the schools and along the bus routes, worked with students, parents, teachers and school administrators to improve the educational experience.&lt;ref name=HistNote /&gt; The CWEC developed a mailing list of over 3,000 people in neighborhoods across the city of racial and ethnic groups and also mobilized over 500 parent volunteers who worked to promote calm and diffuse violence in neighborhoods throughout the city, in the process gathering supporters with a continuing interest in bettering the school system as a whole.

By stepping into the space created by the failure of the Boston School Department and the city to distribute credible information on the desegregation of public schools, the CWEC continued to build its constituency. This expanding support, in combination with the unprecedented focus on public schools as a result of the desegregation orders created the perfect environment for the CWEC to use segregation related issues as a vehicle for pursuing broader educational reform.

==Projects==

The Citywide Educational Coalition (CWEC) has produced and widely circulated five major publications: Parents’ Guide to Magnet Schools (1977), Magnet School in Boston: A Guide for Parents and Students (1978), Survey of Magnet Schools in Three Cities (1978), Boston Public Schools: A Guide for Parents and Students (1979) and The Basic Skills Improvement Program: What Parents Should Expect (1979).&lt;ref name=Magnet&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gelber|first1=Scott|title="The crux and the magic": The Political History of Boston Magnet Schools, 1968–1989|journal=Equity &amp; Excellence in Education|date=2008|volume=41|issue=4|pages=453–466|doi=10.1080/10665680802397632|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10665680802397632#.VFvOqvnF92W|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CWEC has also recruited and trained a number of parent researchers to assist the Boston School Department in their production of the 1980 Guide to Elementary and Magnet Schools as well as publishing annual analyses of the Boston Public School Budget.&lt;ref name=Magnet/&gt;
These publications attempt to increase parent and citizen participation by providing clear, concise, objective information that is free of jargon and encourages parents and concerned citizens to act toward improving their child’s school and schools throughout the city.

Beginning in August 1974, the CWEC published a monthly newsletter first known as “Coalition” and later as “Common Ground.” Nearly 20,000 copies were distributed each month with the help of volunteers to households throughout the city of Boston.

One of CWEC’s major projects was the creation of BPS Watch, a program that requires the Coalition decide upon a single issue facing the Boston Public Schools, such as reading competency, and research it in depth. The goal is to find ways in which this specific issue can be addressed by both the school and the community to improve its function within the school system.

CWEC acts also in an advisory capacity and technical assistant to the School Department. Members have become focused on basic skill competency and have examined vocational/occupational education planning with Boston schools.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16305">A '''computerized classification test''' ('''CCT''') refers to, as its name would suggest, a [[Test (student assessment)|test]] that is administered by [[computer]] for the purpose of [[Classification rule|classifying]] examinees.  The most common CCT is a mastery test where the test classifies examinees as "Pass" or "Fail," but the term also includes tests that classify examinees into more than two categories.  While the term may generally be considered to refer to all computer-administered tests for classification, it is usually used to refer to tests that are interactively administered or of variable-length, similar to [[computerized adaptive testing]] (CAT).  Like CAT, variable-length CCTs can accomplish the goal of the test (accurate classification) with a fraction of the number of items used in a conventional fixed-form test.

A CCT requires several components:

# An [[item bank]] calibrated with a psychometric model selected by the test designer
# A starting point
# An item selection [[algorithm]]
# A termination criterion and scoring procedure

The starting point is not a topic of contention; research on CCT primarily investigates the application of different methods for the other three components.  ''Note:'' The termination criterion and scoring procedure are separate in CAT, but the same in CCT because the test is terminated when a classification is made.  Therefore, there are five components that must be specified to design a CAT.

An introduction to CCT is found in Thompson (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, N. A. (2007). A Practitioner’s Guide for Variable-length Computerized Classification Testing. Practical Assessment Research &amp; Evaluation, 12(1). [http://pareonline.net/getvn.asp?v=12&amp;n=1]&lt;/ref&gt; and a book by Parshall, Spray, Kalohn and Davey (2006).&lt;ref&gt;
Parshall, C. G., Spray, J. A., Kalohn, J. C., &amp; Davey, T. (2006).  Practical considerations in computer-based testing.  New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;  A bibliography of published CCT research is found below.

== How it works ==
A CCT is very similar to a CAT.  Items are administered one at a time to an examinee.  After the examinee responds to the item, the [[computer]] scores it and determines if the examinee is able to be classified yet.  If they are, the test is terminated and the examinee is classified.  If not, another item is administered.  This process repeats until the examinee is classified or another ending point is satisfied (all items in the bank have been administered, or a maximum test length is reached).

== Psychometric model ==
Two approaches are available for the psychometric model of a CCT: [[classical test theory]] (CTT) and [[item response theory]]  (IRT).  Classical test theory assumes a state model because it is applied by determining item parameters for a sample of examinees determined to be in each category.  For instance, several hundred "masters" and several hundred "nonmasters" might be sampled to determine the difficulty and discrimination for each, but doing so requires that you be able to easily identify a distinct set of people that are in each group.  IRT, on the other hand, assumes a trait model; the knowledge or ability measured by the test is a continuum.  The classification groups will need to be more or less arbitrarily defined along the continuum, such as the use of a cutscore to demarcate masters and nonmasters, but the specification of item parameters assumes a trait model.

There are advantages and disadvantages to each.  CTT offers greater conceptual simplicity.  More importantly, CTT requires fewer examinees in the sample for calibration of item parameters to be used eventually in the design of the CCT, making it useful for smaller testing programs.  See Frick (1992)&lt;ref&gt;Frick, T. (1992). Computerized Adaptive Mastery Tests as Expert Systems. Journal of Educational Computing Research, 8(2), 187-213.&lt;/ref&gt; for a description of a CTT-based CCT.  Most CCTs, however, utilize IRT.  IRT offers greater specificity, but the most important reason may be that the design of a CCT (and a CAT) is expensive, and is therefore more likely done by a large testing program with extensive resources.  Such a program would likely use IRT.

== Starting point ==
A CCT must have a specified starting point to enable certain algorithms.  If the [[sequential probability ratio test]] is used as the termination criterion, it implicitly assumes a starting ratio of 1.0 (equal probability of the examinee being a master or nonmaster).  If the termination criterion is a [[confidence interval]] approach, a specified starting point on theta must be specified.  Usually, this is 0.0, the center of the [[Probability distribution|distribution]], but it could also be randomly drawn from a certain distribution if the parameters of the examinee distribution are known.  Also, previous information regarding an individual examinee, such as their score the last time they took the test (if re-taking) may be used.

== Item selection ==
In a CCT, items are selected for administration throughout the test, unlike the traditional method of administering a fixed set of items to all examinees.  While this is usually done by individual item, it can also be done in groups of items known as [[testlet]]s (Leucht &amp; Nungester, 1996;&lt;ref&gt;Luecht, R. M., &amp; Nungester, R. J. (1998). Some practical examples of computer-adaptive sequential testing. Journal of Educational Measurement, 35, 229-249.&lt;/ref&gt; Vos &amp; Glas, 2000&lt;ref &gt;Vos, H.J. &amp; Glas, C.A.W. (2000). Testlet-based adaptive mastery testing.  In van der Linden, W.J., and Glas, C.A.W. (Eds.) Computerized Adaptive Testing: Theory and Practice.
&lt;/ref&gt;).

Methods of item selection fall into two categories: cutscore-based and estimate-based.  Cutscore-based methods (also known as sequential selection) maximize the [[information]] provided by the item at the cutscore, or cutscores if there are more than one, regardless of the ability of the examinee.  Estimate-based methods (also known as adaptive selection) maximize information at the current estimate of examinee ability, regardless of the location of the cutscore.  Both work efficiently, but the efficiency depends in part on the termination criterion employed.  Because the [[sequential probability ratio test]] only evaluates probabilities near the cutscore, cutscore-based item selection is more appropriate.  Because the [[confidence interval]] termination criterion is centered around the examinees ability estimate, estimate-based item selection is more appropriate.  This is because the test will make a classification when the confidence interval is small enough to be completely above or below the cutscore (see below).  The confidence interval will be smaller when the standard error of measurement is smaller, and the standard error of measurement will be smaller when there is more information at the theta level of the examinee.

== Termination criterion ==
There are three termination criteria commonly used for CCTs.  [[Bayesian decision theory]] methods offer great flexibility by presenting an infinite choice of loss/utility structures and evaluation considerations, but also introduce greater arbitrariness.  A [[confidence interval]] approach calculates a confidence interval around the examinee's current theta estimate at each point in the test, and classifies the examinee when the interval falls completely within a region of theta that defines a classification.  This was originally known as adaptive mastery testing (Kingsbury &amp; Weiss, 1983), but does not necessarily require adaptive item selection, nor is it limited to the two-classification mastery testing situation.  The [[sequential probability ratio test]] (Reckase, 1983) defines the classification problem as a [[hypothesis test]] that the examinee's theta is equal to a specified point above the cutscore or a specified point below the cutscore.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5080">'''Confidence weighting (CW)''' is concerned with measuring two variables: (1) what a respondent believes is a correct answer to a question and (2) what degree of certainty the respondent has toward the correctness of this belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ebel|first=R. L.|title=Confidence Weighting and Test Reliability|journal=Journal of Educational Measurement|year=1965|volume=2|issue=1|pages=49–57|doi=10.1111/j.1745-3984.1965.tb00390.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Confidence weighting'' when applied to a specific answer selection for a particular test or exam question is referred to in the literature from [[cognitive psychology]] as item-specific confidence, a term typically used by researchers who investigate metamemory or [[metacognition]], comprehension monitoring, or feeling-of-knowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lundeberg|first=M.|author2=Fox, P. W. |author3=Puncochaf, J. |title=Highly Confident but Wrong: Gender Differences and Similarities in Confidence Judgments|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|year=1994|volume=86|issue=1|pages=114–121|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.86.1.114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Item-specific confidence is defined as calibrating the relationship between an objective performance of accuracy (e.g., a test answer selection) with the subjective measure of confidence, (e.g., a numeric value assigned to the selection).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hacker|first=D. J.|title=Handbook of Metacognition in Education|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=222–239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies on self-confidence and metacognition during test taking (e.g.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kleitman|first=S.|author2=Stankov, L.|title=Ecological and Person-Oriented Aspects of Metacognitive Processes in Test-Taking|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|year=2005|volume=15|issue=3|pages=321–341|doi=10.1002/acp.705}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kleitman|first=S.|author2=Stankov, L.|title=Self-confidence and metacognitive processes|journal=Learning and Individual Differences|year=2007|volume=17|issue=2|pages=161–173|doi=10.1016/j.lindif.2007.03.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have used item-specific confidence as a way to assess the accuracy and confidence underlying knowledge judgments.

Researchers outside of the field of cognitive psychology have used confidence weighting as applied to item-specific judgments in assessing alternative conceptions of difficult concepts in high school biology and physics (e.g.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Odom|first=A. L.|author2=Barrow, L.

==Extent==

The first published material detailing the extent of contract cheating is a study by Robert Clarke and Thomas Lancaster.&lt;ref name="Eliminating" /&gt; The study presented three main findings:

#Over 12 percent of postings on a popular website for outsourcing computer contract work are actually bid requests from students looking to attempt contract cheating.
#Contract cheaters posted an average of 4–7 requests, suggesting that habitual use is made of such services by these students.
#A smaller number of users have posted over 50 bid requests, including examples from multiple institutions. This suggests that these are agencies subcontracting work, not students who are directly making use of the services.

Whereas the quality of solutions to assignments sold by [[essay mill]] has been questioned, a study by Jenkins and Helmore showed that work obtained through the use of an [[Online auction|auction site]] was of sufficient quality to gain good marks and remain undetected by the module [[tutor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ics.heacademy.ac.uk/Events/HEADublin2006_V2/papers/Tony%20Jenkins%2023.pdf |format=PDF|title=T. Jenkins and S. Helmore "Coursework for cash: the threat from on-line plagiarism", in Proceedings of 7th Annual Conference for Information and Computer Science, Dublin. Higher Education Academy pp121-126 (August 2006)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent study examined over 900 examples of contract cheating by students studying computing subjects. The published results categorise the assignment types (e.g. Programming, Database, Web Design) and are analysed by country. One new concern identified by this study was the number of major projects (both final year undergraduate and postgraduate) being posted onto auction sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ics.heacademy.ac.uk/events/8th-annual-conf/Papers/Thomas%20Lancaster%20final.pdf|title=Assessing Contract Cheating Through Auction Sites – A Computing Perspective|first1=Robert|last1=Clarke |first2=Thomas|last2=Lancaster|date=2007-08-30|accessdate=2007-09-13 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a study of 4,000 suspected cases of "contract cheating" some interesting patterns of behaviour have been observed. A summary was presented at the HEA Workshop on Contract Cheating (March 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ics.heacademy.ac.uk/events/presentations/682_Private%20Life%20Annotated.pdf|title=The Private Life of an Assignment|first1=Robert|last1=Clarke |first2=Thomas|last2=Lancaster|date=2008-03-07|accessdate=2011-01-09 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Aske conference held in June 2009 a paper detailing a "multi-faceted" approach to dealing with the problem of "contract cheating" was presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.brookes.ac.uk/aske/documents/Plagiarism09_LancasterClarke.pdf|format=PDF|title=Contract Cheating in UK Higher Education: promoting a proactive approach|first1=Robert|last1=Clarke |first2=Thomas|last2=Lancaster|date=2009-06-04|accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper presented at the STEM conference (April 2012) was a study of over 600 assignments in subject areas ranging from "Anthropology to Theology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/assets/documents/stem-conference/Computing%201/Thomas_Lancaster_Robert_Clarke.pdf|title=Dealing with contract cheating: a question of attribution|first1=Robert|last1=Clarke |first2=Thomas|last2=Lancaster|date=2012-04-18|accessdate=2012-05-03 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commercial Aspects of Contract Cheating are examined in a paper given at ITiCSE '13. This paper analyses the monetary value of contract cheating to the different parties who play a role in the contract cheating process. The main analysis is based on a corpus consisting of 14,438 identified attempts to cheat. The corpus was collected between March 2005 and July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2462497|title=Commercial aspects of contract cheating|first1=Robert|last1=Clarke |first2=Thomas|last2=Lancaster|date=2013-07-01|accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.slideshare.net/ThomasLancaster/commercial-aspects-of-contract-cheating-iticse-2013|title=Commercial aspects of contract cheating (Slides)|first1=Robert|last1=Clarke |first2=Thomas|last2=Lancaster|date=2013-07-01|accessdate=2013-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2017 meta-analysis of 5 studies, 3.5% of a total of 1378 students reported buying assignments to submit as their own. Of the students who reported engaging in contract cheating, more than 60% admitted doing so more than once.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curtis|first=Guy J.|last2=Clare|first2=Joseph|date=2017-04-20|title=How Prevalent is Contract Cheating and to What Extent are Students Repeat Offenders?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10805-017-9278-x|journal=Journal of Academic Ethics|language=en|pages=1–10|doi=10.1007/s10805-017-9278-x|issn=1570-1727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
The assignments prepared by essay-writing companies and other paid third-parties are supposedly 'original', meaning that they are likely to evade detection by software packages such as Turnitin. Assessment design strategies may limit the possibility that students can use contract cheating services, although a 2014 publication in Educational Studies showed that reducing the time that students have to prepare their assessments is unlikely to deter contract cheating, and that there appeared to be significant spare capacity in the contract cheating market.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, M.J. and Newton P.M. 2014.

== Detection ==
In July 2007 a paper proposed a systematic six-stage process that tutors can use to detect students who are contract cheating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4365466|title=Establishing a Systematic Six-Stage Process for Detecting Contract Cheating|last2=Lancaster|first2=Thomas|date=2007-07-26|website=|first1=Robert|last1=Clarke|accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contract cheating sites often claim this form of cheating is undetectable,&lt;ref name="Lines 889–914"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lines|first=Lisa|date=2016-11-16|title=Ghostwriters guaranteeing grades? The quality of online ghostwriting services available to tertiary students in Australia|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13562517.2016.1198759|journal=Teaching in Higher Education|volume=21|issue=8|pages=889–914|doi=10.1080/13562517.2016.1198759|issn=1356-2517}}&lt;/ref&gt; a claim that has been tested in two studies. In a 2016 Australian study, when markers were asked to mark a set of contract cheating assignments and contract cheating was not mentioned to them, no marker raised any concerns of contract cheating.&lt;ref name="Lines 889–914"/&gt; However, in a later study when markers were specifically asked to detect it, they correctly identified contract cheating 62% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dawson|first=Phillip|last2=Sutherland-Smith|first2=Wendy|date=2017-06-05|title=Can markers detect contract cheating?

It has recently been proposed that existing assignment and invigilated assessment data can be systematically analyzed in order to detect patterns of students' performance that may be indicative of contract cheating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clare|first=Joseph|last2=Walker|first2=Sonia|last3=Hobson|first3=Julia|date=2017-08-08|title=Can we detect contract cheating using existing assessment data? Applying crime prevention theory to an academic integrity issue|url=https://edintegrity.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-017-0015-4|journal=International Journal for Educational Integrity|language=En|volume=13|issue=1|pages=4|doi=10.1007/s40979-017-0015-4|issn=1833-2595}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, at the Plagiarism across Europe and Beyond conference, it was demonstrated how collecting analytical data at the time of writing can help in identifying cases where a student committed contract cheating. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url= https://plagiarism.pefka.mendelu.cz/files/proceedings_15.pdf |title=Plagiarism detection 2.0: Detection of Contract Cheating |last1=Khan |first1=Wasi |year=2015|publisher= Mendel University|book-title= |pages=215|location=Brno |conference= Plagiarism Across Europe and Beyond }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media| people = Khan, Wasi (Presenter)| date = Aug 3, 2015| title = Plagiarism Across Europe and Beyond| medium = Motion picture| language = English | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14f5AnfTy0A | access-date = November 12, 2017| location = Brno, Czech Republic | publisher = Plagiarism Across Europe and Beyond
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although non-originality engines (like [[Turnitin]]) are unlikely to detect contract cheating, there has been some success in using them to identify the source of assignments detected on auction sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/resources/detail/stem-conference-2014/Post_event_resources/Computing/Using_Turnitin|title=Using Turnitin as a tool for attribution in cases of contract cheating|last2=Lancaster|first2=Thomas|date=2014-04-13|first1=Robert|last1=Clarke|accessdate=2014-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Penalties==
In general, academic institutions consider contract cheating to be one of the most serious forms of academic misconduct and it is penalised accordingly. In 2010 the 'AMBeR Project' developed a UK 'Plagiarism Tariff' in an attempt to standardise penalties for all forms of academic misconduct. The final report noted that purchase of an assignment should be penalised with the most serious penalties available, such as expulsion from the institution, and that many institutions considered it to be a separate form of misconduct altogether due to the seemingly obvious intent associated with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/plagiarism-tariff-let-the-punishment-fit-the-demerit-points/412088.article|title=Plagiarism tariff: let the punishment fit the demerit points|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2015 research study, also in the UK, asked university students what they thought penalties for academic misconduct should be. The responses demonstrated that students consistently recommended lenient penalties for plagiarism, and that this effect was most pronounced for contract cheating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cronfa.swan.ac.uk/Record/cronfa20205|title=Academic integrity: a quantitative study of confidence and understanding in students at the start of their higher education|publisher=|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/hundreds-fail-to-spot-plagiarism/2019818.article|title=Hundreds fail to spot plagiarism|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02602938.2015.1024199#.VccNJvma5kU|title= Academic integrity: a quantitative study of confidence and understanding in students at the start of their higher education|accessdate=22 May 2016 | doi=10.1080/02602938.2015.1024199|volume=41|journal=Assessment &amp; Evaluation in Higher Education|pages=482–497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
The legality of contract cheating services was reviewed by Newton and Lang in a 2016 book chapter of the Springer Handbook for Academic Integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-981-287-098-8_38|title=Handbook of Academic Integrity|first1=Philip M.|last1=Newton|first2=Christopher|last2=Lang|editor-first=Tracey|editor-last=Bretag|date=1 January 2016|publisher=Springer Singapore|pages=249–271|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1007/978-981-287-098-8_38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal status of these services varies internationally. In [[New Zealand]] it is illegal to "advertise or provide third party assistance to cheat", with similar, older laws on the statutes of 17 states in the US. 

In the United Kingdom, the Quality Assurance Agency published a report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/newsroom/education-deterrence-detection-how-to-tackle-the-problem-of-essay-mills|title=Education, deterrence, detection: how to tackle the problem of essay mills|date=2016-08-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919071215/http://www.qaa.ac.uk/newsroom/education-deterrence-detection-how-to-tackle-the-problem-of-essay-mills|archivedate=19 September 2016|work=QAA news}}&lt;/ref&gt; advocating the use of a legal approach as one way to tackle contract cheating, and suggesting that existing fraud laws might be used, since the activities of such services, and their clients, could be reasonably interpreted to fit with definitions of fraud as they involve 'false representation' and 'failure to disclose information'. A subsequent research project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://edintegrity.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-017-0014-5|title=Are Essay Mills committing fraud? An analysis of their behaviours vs the 2006 Fraud Act (UK)|publisher=|journal=International Journal for Educational Integrity|volume=13|issue=1|pages=3|doi=10.1007/s40979-017-0014-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared the UK Fraud laws with the terms and conditions used by contract cheating services and concluded that they would be unlikely to fall foul of [[Fraud]] law due to the disclaimers, terms and conditions they use which generally state that any custom written products are to be used only as 'study guides' or 'revision aids', thereby placing responsibility, and 'intent', onto the student client. Despite this,  media 'stings' have shown that companies can be complicit in the inappropriate use of these products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/article1422913.ece|title=‘£630 and I’ll put you on the way to a first’|date=15 June 2014|author1=Robin Henry|author2=Cal Flyn|author3=Katie Glass|publisher=The Sunday Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar analysis in [[Lithuania]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://edintegrity.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-017-0020-7|title=Ethical and legal observations on contract cheating services as an agreement|publisher=|journal=International Journal for Educational Integrity|volume=13|issue=1|pages=9|doi=10.1007/s40979-017-0020-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that contract cheating services were unlikely to fall foul of existing laws, although an analysis of [[Australian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1037969X17710627|title=Contract cheating: Will students pay for serious criminal consequences?|date=18 September 2017|publisher=|journal=Alternative Law Journal|volume=42|issue=2|pages=123–129|doi=10.1177/1037969x17710627}}&lt;/ref&gt; law concluded that fraud, as well as forgery and conspiracy, might be legal avenues via which contract cheating could be targeted. All three studies called for the introduction of new legal approaches to tackle contract cheating.

A follow-up research study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://edintegrity.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-017-0022-5|title=A legal approach to tackling contract cheating?|publisher=|journal=International Journal for Educational Integrity|volume=13|issue=1|pages=11|doi=10.1007/s40979-017-0022-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed such a new law, based on the principle of [[strict liability]], which lessens the requirement for prosecutors to demonstrate that they 'intended to help student cheat', but instead would make them liable for prosecution simply for offering services that could be reasonably interpreted as being used for contract cheating.  

More broadly, despite the apparent potential of a legal challenge to contract cheating companies, prosecutions are currently rare, largely due to the limitations of existing laws. In addition, the simple act of outlawing a service would not necessarily reduce demand for it; the aforementioned research studies all call for a holistic, multi-pronged approach to tackling contract cheating.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8433">A '''criterion-referenced test''' is a style of test which uses [[Test (student assessment)|test]] scores to generate a statement about the [[behavior]] that can be expected of a person with that score.  Most tests and quizzes that are written by school teachers can be considered criterion-referenced tests.  In this case, the objective is simply to see whether the student has learned the material. Criterion-referenced assessment can be contrasted with [[norm-referenced assessment]] and [[ipsative assessment]].

Criterion-referenced testing was a major focus of [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] research in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weiss | first1 = D.J. | last2 = Davison | first2 = M.L. | year = 1981 | title = Test Theory and Methods | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 32 | issue = | page = 1 | doi=10.1146/annurev.ps.32.020181.003213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition of ''criterion''==

A common misunderstanding regarding the term is the meaning of ''criterion''.  Many, if not most, criterion-referenced tests involve a [[cutscore]], where the examinee passes if their score exceeds the cutscore and fails if it does not (often called a mastery test).  The ''criterion'' is not the cutscore; the criterion is the domain of subject matter that the test is designed to assess.  For example, the criterion may be "Students should be able to correctly add two single-digit numbers," and the cutscore may be that students should correctly answer a minimum of 80% of the questions to pass.

The criterion-referenced interpretation of a test score identifies the relationship to the subject matter.  In the case of a mastery test, this does mean identifying whether the examinee has "mastered" a specified level of the subject matter by comparing their score to the cutscore.  However, not all criterion-referenced tests have a cutscore, and the score can simply refer to a person's standing on the subject domain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.questionmark.com/us/glossary.htm] QuestionMark Glossary&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[ACT (test)|ACT]] is an example of this; there is no cutscore, it simply is an assessment of the student's knowledge of high-school level subject matter.

Because of this common misunderstanding, criterion-referenced tests have also been called [[standards-based assessment]]s by some education agencies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apapdc.edu.au/archive/ASPA/conference2000/papers/art_3_9.htm Assessing the Assessment of Outcomes Based Education] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829075106/http://www.apapdc.edu.au/archive/ASPA/conference2000/papers/art_3_9.htm |date=2006-08-29 }} by Dr Malcolm Venter. Cape Town, South Africa. "OBE advocates a criterion-based system, which means getting rid of the bell curve, phasing out grade point averages and comparative grading".&lt;/ref&gt; as students are assessed with regards to standards that define what they "should" know, as defined by the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.home-school.com/exclusive/standards.html Homeschool World] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906101322/http://www.home-school.com/exclusive/standards.html |date=2006-09-06 }}: "The Education Standards Movement Spells Trouble for Private and Home Schools"&lt;/ref&gt;

Both terms ''criterion-referenced'' and ''norm-referenced'' were originally coined by [[Robert Glaser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Glaser | first1 = R. | year = 1963 | title = Instructional technology and the measurement of learning outcomes | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 18 | issue = 8| pages = 519–522 | doi = 10.1037/h0049294 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike a criterion-reference test, a [[norm-referenced test]] indicates whether the test-taker did better or worse than other people who took the test.
For example, if the criterion is "Students should be able to correctly add two single-digit numbers," then reasonable test questions might look like "&lt;math&gt;2+3 = ?&lt;/math&gt;" or "&lt;math&gt;9+5 = ?&lt;/math&gt;"  A criterion-referenced test would report the student's performance strictly according to whether the individual student correctly answered these questions. A norm-referenced test would report primarily whether this student correctly answered more questions compared to other students in the group.
Even when testing similar topics, a test which is designed to accurately assess mastery may use different questions than one which is intended to show relative [[ranking]]. This is because some questions are better at reflecting actual achievement of students, and some test questions are better at differentiating between the best students and the worst students. (Many questions will do both.)  A criterion-referenced test will use questions which were correctly answered by students who know the specific material. A norm-referenced test will use questions which were correctly answered by the "best" students and not correctly answered by the "worst" students (e.g. Cambridge University's pre-entry 'S' paper).
Some tests can provide useful information about both actual achievement and relative ranking. The [[ACT (test)|ACT]] provides both a ranking, and indication of what level is considered necessary to likely success in college.&lt;ref&gt;Cronbach, L. J. (1970). ''Essentials of psychological testing'' (3rd ed.). New York: Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that the term "criterion-referenced test" is a misnomer, since it can refer to the ''interpretation'' of the score as well as the test itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haertel | first1 = E. | year = 1985 | title = Construct validity and criterion-referenced testing | url = | journal = Review of Educational Research | volume = 55 | issue = 1| pages = 23–46 | doi=10.3102/00346543055001023}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the previous example, the same score on the ACT can be interpreted in a norm-referenced or criterion-referenced manner.

==Relationship to high-stakes testing==
Many high-profile criterion-referenced tests are also [[high-stakes test]]s, where the results of the test have important implications for the individual examinee.  Examples of this include [[high school graduation examination]]s and licensure testing where the test must be passed to work in a profession, such as to become a physician or attorney.  However, being a high-stakes test is not specifically a feature of a criterion-referenced test.  It is instead a feature of how an educational or government agency chooses to use the results of the test.

==Examples==
* [[Driving test]]s are criterion-referenced tests, because their goal is to see whether the test taker is skilled enough to be granted a driver's license, not to see whether one test taker is more skilled than another test taker.
* [[:Category:Citizenship tests|Citizenship tests]] are usually criterion-referenced tests, because their goal is to see whether the test taker is sufficiently familiar with the new country's history and government, not to see whether one test taker is more knowledgeable than another test taker.

{{tone|date=May 2015}}
A '''culminating project''' (also known as a '''senior project''', '''grad project''' or '''exit project'''), is a project that challenges high school seniors to demonstrate their academic knowledge in an experiential way (in most cases). According to the US Dept of Education&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/esea02/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; State Education Boards typically allow individual [[school district]]s to customize the project, based on basic state guidelines. 

== Confusion about the culminating project ==

People reporting on the culminating project sometimes confuse the terminology with the state [[high school exit exam]]. The state exit exam is a written exam that usually tests student’s math, reading, writing, and science skills, whereas the culminating project is a required project that is usually a learning experience based on a topic chosen by the student. The project is mandatory in order to graduate.

== Purpose ==
The purpose of the project is to increase both teaching and learning. High school graduation standards have declined for several decades. [[Education reform|School reform]] or the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ed.gov/parents/academic/involve/nclbguide/parentsguide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; is a way to bring value back to the high school diploma as well as support students  as they go out into the world prepared for college, a job, the military, entrepreneurship, internship, or whatever path students decide to follow once they graduate.

== Why a project is required ==
The requirement is an effort to increase the education standards. As [[college admissions]] and the workplace require more from their recruits, nationwide high schools must also.

In an effort to be clear, it is restated that the culminating project is not required by all schools. Again, parents and guardians would have to check with the student’s school official website for graduation requirements.

However, for students that are required to complete a culminating project, this is a chance for the student to explore a topic of personal interest. The project provides an opportunity that student may not have otherwise. By completing the project, students have a [[real life experience]] that can help them in their next adventure in life (college, job, entrepreneurship, military, internship, etc.).

Students gain a number of important skills by participating in the process such as,
* Leadership
* Communication
* Project management
* [[Time management]]
* Group skills
* Negotiation skills
* Meeting deadlines
* Conflict management
* [[Public speaking]]
* Presentation skills
* [[Self motivation]]

== Kinds of projects ==
The high school graduation culminating project format varies from state to state and even school to school within the same state. Parents and guardians will have to check with their students specific school for their requirements. Typically the project consists of choosing a topic of interest, writing a [[Academic publishing|research paper]] on that topic, having an experience directly related to the topic, keeping a journal of artifacts demonstrating your work, followed by the final step which is a presentation (US Dept of Education).

The student usually presents the project to a panel consisting of 2-5 people typically made up of teachers, community members, faculty, and staff. However, some schools have student present to a panel of their peers. Schools and school districts have total discretion to format the process in a way that works best for their students and their school culture.

In some cases, students complete a project on their own with the support of a mentor from their community. Some schools allow group projects and [[Presentation of a group|group presentation]]. For example, it would not be uncommon for the leadership class of a school to raise funds to build a school in Africa. Other requirements include a mandatory social/community aspect related to the project which means the high school graduation project has to benefit someone other than the student.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3603">'''Educational measurement''' refers to the use of educational assessments and the analysis of data such as scores obtained from educational assessments to infer the abilities and proficiencies of students. The approaches overlap with those in [[psychometrics]].
Educational measurement is the assigning of numerals to traits such as achievement, interest, attitudes, aptitudes, [[intelligence]] and performance.   

==Overview==
The aim of theory and practice in educational measurement is typically to measure abilities and levels of attainment by students in areas such as reading, writing, mathematics, science and so forth. Traditionally, attention focuses on whether assessments are reliable and valid. In practice, educational measurement is largely concerned with the analysis of data from educational assessments or tests. Typically, this means using total scores on assessments, whether they are multiple choice or open-ended and marked using marking rubrics or guides.

In technical terms, the pattern of scores by individual students to individual items is used to infer so-called scale locations of students, the "measurements". This process is one form of scaling. Essentially, higher total scores give higher scale locations, consistent with the traditional and everyday use of total scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Baker | first = F| title = The Basics of Item Response Theory| publisher = ERIC Clearinghouse on Assessment and Evaluation | location = University of Maryland, College Park, MD | year = 2001 | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; If certain theory is used, though, there is not a strict correspondence between the ordering of total scores and the ordering of scale locations. The Rasch model provides a strict correspondence provided all students attempt the same test items, or their performances are marked using the same marking rubrics.

In terms of the broad body of purely mathematical theory drawn on, there is substantial overlap between educational measurement and psychometrics. However, certain approaches considered to be a part of psychometrics, including [[Classical test theory]], [[Item Response Theory]] and the [[Rasch model]], were originally developed more specifically for the analysis of data from educational assessments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Rasch| first = Georg| title = Probabilistic models for some intelligence and attainment tests. |publisher = Danish Institute for Educational Research | location = Copenhagen | year = 1960 | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Lord | first = Fred | title = Applications of item response theory to practical testing problems. |publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.
 | location = CMahwah, NJ | year = 1980 | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the aims of applying theory and techniques in educational measurement is to try to place the results of different tests administered to different groups of students on a single or common scale through processes known as [[test equating]]. The rationale is that because different assessments usually have different difficulties, the total scores cannot be directly compared. The aim of trying to place results on a common scale is to allow comparison of the scale locations inferred from the totals via scaling processes.

[[Image:Edupunk.jpg|thumb|Jim Groom as "poster boy" for edupunk]]
'''Edupunk''' is a [[do it yourself]] (DIY) attitude to teaching and learning practices.&lt;ref name="young"&gt;{{harvnb|Young|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="keats"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/culture/culturereviews/magazine/16-10/st_jw | title = Jargon Watch: Green Crude, Popcorning, Edupunk | author = Keats, Jonathon | publisher = [[Wired Magazine]] | date = 2008-09-22 | accessdate = 2008-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tom Kuntz described edupunk as "an approach to teaching that avoids mainstream tools like PowerPoint and Blackboard, and instead aims to bring the rebellious attitude and DIY ethos of ’70s bands like The Clash to the classroom."&lt;ref name="kuntz"&gt;{{harvnb|Kuntz|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many instructional applications can be described as DIY education or ''edupunk''.

The term was first used on May 25, 2008, by [[Jim Groom]] in his blog,&lt;ref name="groom"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://bavatuesdays.com/the-glass-bees/ | title = The Glass Bees | author = Groom, Jim | publisher = Weblog bavatuesdays | date = 2008-05-25 | accessdate = 2008-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and covered less than a week later in the [[The Chronicle of Higher Education|Chronicle of Higher Education]].&lt;ref name="young" /&gt; [[Stephen Downes]], an [[online education]] theorist and an editor for the ''[[International Journal of Instructional Technology and Distance Learning]]'', noted that "the concept of edupunk has totally caught wind, spreading through the blogosphere like wildfire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=44760 | title = Introducing Edupunk | author = [[Stephen Downes]] | date = 2008-05-28 | accessdate = 2008-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects==
Edupunk has risen from an objection to the efforts of government and [[Corporatism|corporate interests]] in reframing and bundling [[emerging technologies]] into ''[[wikt:cookie-cutter|cookie-cutter]]'' products with pre-defined application—somewhat similar to traditional [[punk ideologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/mortarboard/2008/06/punk_or_more_precisely.html | title = Nevermind the pedagogues, here's edupunk | author = Cohen, David | work = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 2008-06-16 | location=London | date=2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reaction to corporate influence on education is only one part of edupunk, though. Stephen Downes has identified three aspects to this approach:
* Reaction against [[commercialization]] of learning
* [[DIY ethic|Do-it-yourself attitude]]
* Thinking and learning for yourself&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Rowell | first = Laurie | title = "Edupunk" Rocks the (Virtual) House | newspaper = eLearn Magazine  | date = 2008-07-08 | url = http://www.elearnmag.org/subpage.cfm?section=articles&amp;article=65-1 | ref = harv | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
An example of edupunk was the [[University of British Columbia]]'s course "[[Wikipedia:WikiProject Murder Madness and Mayhem]]" experiment of creating articles on [[Wikipedia]] in spring 2008, "(having) one’s students as partners and peers."&lt;ref name="mayhem"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://bavatuesdays.com/murder-madness-mayhem/ | title = Murder, Madness, Mayhem is so EDUPUNK&lt;!--(sic)--&gt; | author = Groom, Jim | publisher = Weblog bavatuesdays | date = 2008-05-28 | accessdate = 2008-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A video clip illustrating an edupunk approach, produced by Tony Hirst at the Open University in the UK, on 8 June 2008, illustrated how quickly the edupunk concept has been adopted outside North America.&lt;ref name="Hirst"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNTlescIvW0 | title = Changing Expectations| author = Hirst, A.| publisher = YouTube | date = 2008-06-08 | accessdate = 2008-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A website set up by Australian educators illustrates how edupunk spread,&lt;ref name="ausedupunk"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://edupunk.com.au | title = edupunk | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080827204329/http://www.edupunk.com.au/ | archivedate = 2008-08-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a presentation by [[Norm Friesen]] of [[Thompson Rivers University]] identifies a number of possible intellectual precursors for the movement.

[[Hampshire College]], [[Evergreen State College]], [[Marlboro College]], [[New College of Florida]], and [[Warren Wilson College]] are collegiate institutions imbued with edupunk ideology.&lt;ref name="Friesenpres"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blip.tv/play/AeuPI4OyJA | title = The Edupunk Heritage: Precursors of Open Learning | author = [[Norm Friesen]] | publisher = Blip.tv | date = 2009-02-06 | accessdate = 2009-02-23 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Friesenart"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://wikieducator.org/Open_Education:_Precursors| title = Open Education: Precursors | author = [[Norm Friesen]]| publisher = WikiEducator | date = 2009-02-22 | accessdate = 2009-02-23 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electronic assessment''', also known as '''e-assessment''', '''online assessment''', '''computer assisted/mediated assessment''' and '''computer-based assessment''', is the use of [[information technology]] in various forms of assessment such as [[educational assessment]], [[health assessment]], [[psychiatric assessment]], and [[psychological assessment]].&lt;!--wrong- broader definition applies- need sourcing--&gt; This may utilize an [[online]] [[computer]] connected to a [[Computer network|network]]. This definition embraces a wide range of student activity ranging from the use of a [[word processor]] to on-screen [[Test (student assessment)|testing]]. Specific types of e-assessment include multiple choice, online/electronic submission, [[computerized adaptive testing]] and [[computerized classification test]]ing.

Different types of online assessments contain elements of one or more of the following components, depending on the assessment's purpose: formative, diagnostic, or summative.&lt;ref name=Rovai2008&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Rovai A, Ponton M, Baker J |title=Distance Learning in Higher Education: A programmatic Approach to Planning, Design, Instruction, Evaluation, and Accreditation|year=2008|publisher=Teachers College Press|isbn=978-0-8077-4878-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|80–82}} Instant and detailed [[feedback]] may (or may not) be enabled.

In education assessment, large-scale examining bodies find the journey from traditional paper-based exam assessment to fully electronic assessment a long one. Practical considerations such as having the necessary IT hardware to enable large numbers of student to sit an electronic examination at the same time, as well as the need to ensure a stringent level of security (for example, see: [[Academic dishonesty]]) are among the concerns that need to resolved to accomplish this transition.

e-marking is one way that many exam assessment and awarding bodies, such as [[Cambridge International Examinations]], are utilizing innovations in technology to expedite the marking of examinations (see: [[Electronic marking]]). In some cases, e-marking can be combined with electronic examinations, whilst in other cases students will still handwrite their exams with papers scanned in securely and uploaded into an e-marking system.

== Application ==
E-assessment is becoming more widely used by exam awarding bodies, particularly those with multiple or international study centres and those which offer remote study courses. Industry bodies such as [http://www.e-assessment.com The e-Assessment Association] (eAA), founded in 2008, as well as events run by the [http://www.testpublishers.org/ Association of Test Publishers (ATP)] that focus specifically on [http://www.innovationsintesting.org/ Innovations in Testing], represent the growth in adoption of technology-enhanced assessment.

In psychiatric and psychological testing, e-assessment can be used not only to assess [[cognitive]] and [[practical]] abilities but anxiety disorders, such as [[social anxiety disorder]], i.e. [[Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory-Brief form|SPAI-B]]. Widely in psychology.&lt;ref name="Lichtenwald1986" /&gt;{{rp|4–10}} Cognitive abilities are assessed using ''e-testing'' software, while practical abilities are assessed using ''e-portfolios'' or ''simulation'' software.

==Types==
Online assessment is used primarily to measure [[cognitive]] abilities, demonstrating what has been learned after a particular educational event has occurred, such as the end of an instructional unit or chapter. When assessing practical abilities or to demonstrate learning that has occurred over a longer period of time an online portfolio (or [[ePortfolio]]) is often used. The first element that must be prepared when teaching an online course is assessment. Assessment is used to determine if learning is happening, to what extent and if changes need to be made.&lt;ref name=Rovai2008/&gt;{{rp|79}}

===Independent work===

Most students will not complete assignments unless there is an assessment (i.e. [[motivation]]). It is the instructors role to catalyze student motivation. Appropriate [[feedback]] is the key to assessment, whether or not the assessment is graded.&lt;ref name=Rovai2008/&gt;{{rp|83–86}}

===Group work===

Students are often asked to [[group work|work in groups]]. With this brings on new assessment strategies. Students can be evaluated using a collaborative learning model in which the learning is driven by the students and/or a cooperative learning model where tasks are assigned and the instructor is involved in decisions.&lt;ref name=Rovai2008/&gt;{{rp|86–89}}

Pre-testing – Prior to the teaching of a lesson or concept, a student can complete an online pretest to determine their level of knowledge. This form of assessment helps determine a baseline so that when a summative assessment or post-test is given, quantitative evidence is provided showing that learning has occurred.

[[Formative assessment]] – Formative assessment is used to provide feedback during the learning process. In online assessment situations, objective questions are posed, and feedback is provided to the student either during or immediately after the assessment.

[[Summative assessment]] – Summative assessments provide a quantitative grade and are often given at the end of a unit or lesson to determine that the learning objectives have been met.

Practice Testing – With the ever-increasing use of high-stakes testing in the educational arena, online practice tests are used to give students an edge. Students can take these types of assessments multiple times to familiarize themselves with the content and format of the assessment.

[[Statistical survey|Surveys]] – Online surveys may be used by educators to collect data and feedback on student attitudes, perceptions or other types of information that might help improve the instruction.

[[Evaluation]]s – This type of survey allows facilitators to collect data and feedback on any type of situation where the course or experience needs justification or improvement.

[[Performance test (assessment)|Performance testing]] – The user shows what they know and what they can do. This type of testing is used to show technological proficiency, [[reading comprehension]], math skills, etc. This assessment is also used to identify gaps in student learning.

New technologies, such as the [[World Wide Web|Web]], [[Digital data|digital]] video, sound, [[animation]]s, and [[interactivity]], are providing tools that can make assessment design and implementation more efficient, timely, and sophisticated.

==Electronic marking==

Electronic marking, also known as e-marking and onscreen marking, is the use of digital [[educational technology]] specifically designed for marking. The term refers to the electronic marking or [[Grading (education)|grading]] of an exam. E-marking is an examiner led activity closely related to other [[e-assessment]] activities such as e-testing, or e-learning which are student led. E-marking allows markers to mark a scanned script or online response on a computer screen rather than on paper.

There are no restrictions to the types of tests that can use e-marking, with e-marking applications designed to accommodate multiple choice, written, and even video submissions for performance examinations. E-marking software is used by individual educational institutions and can also be rolled out to the participating schools of awarding exam organisations. e-marking has been used to mark many well known high stakes examinations, which in the United Kingdom include  [[A levels]] and [[GCSE]] exams, and in the US includes the [[SAT]] test for college admissions. [[Ofqual]] reports that e-marking is the main type of marking used for general qualifications in the United Kingdom.

===History===
Early adopters include the [[University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate]], (which operates under the brand name [[Cambridge Assessment]]) which conducted its first major test of e-marking in November 2000. Cambridge Assessment has conducted extensive research into e-marking and e-assessment. The syndicate has published a series of papers, including research specific to e-marking such as: Examining the impact of moving to on-screen marking on concurrent validity.&lt;ref name=CA&gt;{{cite web|title=Examining the impact of moving to on-screen marking on concurrent validity|url=http://www.cambridgeassessment.org.uk/Images/208850-examining-the-impact-of-moving-to-on-screen-marking-on-concurrent-validity.pdf|website=Cambridge Assessment|publisher=Cambridge Assessment|accessdate=15 October 2015|ref=CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[International Baccalaureate]] implemented e-marking. In 2012, 66% of nearly 16 million exam scripts were "e-marked" in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=RM group=Education&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rise of Onscreen Marking Around The World|url=http://rmresults.co.uk/the-rise-and-rise-of-onscreen-exam-marking-around-the-world|website=RM Results|publisher=RM Results|accessdate=15 October 2015|ref=Rise of onscreen marking}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ofqual]] reports that in 2015, all key stage 2 tests in the United Kingdom will be marked onscreen.

In 2014, the [[Scottish Qualifications Authority]] (SQA) announced that most of the National 5 question papers would be e-marked.&lt;ref name=SQA&gt;{{cite web|title=An Introduction to E-marking|url=https://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/files_ccc/IntroductioneMarkingMFI.pdf|website=SQA|publisher=SQA|accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, the [[Odisha]] state government in India announced that it planned to use e-marking for all Plus II papers from 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State government of India announces that it would be using e-marking for all streams from 2016|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/E-marking-for-all-streams-from-2016/articleshow/47510723.cms|website=Times of India|publisher=Times of India|accessdate=15 October 2015|ref=TI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Process ===

e-marking can be used to mark examinations that are completed on paper and then scanned and uploaded as digital images, as well as online examinations. Multiple-choice exams can be either marked by examiners online or be automarked where appropriate. When marking written script exams, e-marking applications provide markers with the online tools and resources to mark as they go and can add up marks as they progress without exceeding the prescribed total for each question.

All candidate details are hidden from the work being marked to ensure anonymity during the marking process. Once marking is complete, results can be uploaded immediately, reducing both the time spent by examiners posting results and the wait time for students.

The e-marking FAQ&lt;ref&gt;[http://rmresults.co.uk/e-marking/e-marking-frequently-asked-questions E-marking: Frequently Asked Questions]&lt;/ref&gt; is a comprehensive list of answers to frequently asked questions surrounding e-marking.

==Advantages==
It has also been noted that in regards to university level work, providing electronic feedback can be more time-consuming than traditional assessments, and therefore more expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Assignments 2.0: The role of social presence and computer attitudes in student preferences for online versus offline marking|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096751615000457|journal = The Internet and Higher Education|date = 2016-01-01|pages = 8–16|volume = 28|doi = 10.1016/j.iheduc.2015.08.002|first = Rachel|last = Grieve|first2 = Christine R.|last2 = Padgett|first3 = Robyn L.|last3 = Moffitt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Lichtenwald investigated the test validity and test reliability of either personal computer administration or a paper and pencil administration of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised (PPVT-R). His project report included a review and analysis of the literature of pre mid 1980s E-assessment systems.&lt;ref name=Lichtenwald1986&gt;Lichtenwald, Terrance G. (1986). "[http://wwwresearchgate.net/profile/Terrance_Lichtenwald2/publicationsArticle: An Investigation of the validity, reliability, and acceptance by children of a microcomputer administration of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised (PPVT-R)]," http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED558200.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of the literature of E-assessment from the 1970s until 2000 examined the advantages and disadvantages of E-assessments.&lt;ref&gt;Millsap, Claudette M. (2000). "[https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc2621/m2/1/high_res_d/Dissertation.pdf] by CM Millsap – 2000 Comparison of Computer Testing versus Traditional Paper and Pencil"&lt;/ref&gt;

A detailed review of the literature regarding advantages and disadvantages of E-assessment for different types of tests for different types of students in different educational environment from childhood through young adulthood was completed in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Blazer, Christie (2010). "[http://www. U.S. Department of .files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED544707.pdf Information Capsule]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050411000000/http://www./ |date=April 11, 2005 }}," Research Services, Volume 0918.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic dishonesty===
[[Academic dishonesty]], commonly known as cheating, occurs in all levels of educational institutions. In traditional classrooms, students cheat in various forms such as hidden prepared notes not permitted to be used or looking at another student's paper during an exam, copying homework from one another, or copying from a book, article or media without properly citing the source. Individuals can be dishonest due to lack of time management skills, pursuit for better grades, cultural behavior or a misunderstanding of plagiarism.&lt;ref name="Rovai2008"/&gt;{{rp|89}}

Online classroom environments are no exception to the possibility of academic dishonesty. It can easily be seen from a student's perspective as an easy passing grade. Proper assignments types, meetings and projects can prevent academic dishonesty in the online classroom.&lt;ref name=Rovai2008/&gt;{{rp|89–90}}  However, online assessment may provide additional possibilities for cheating, such as hacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dawson|first1=Phillip|title=Five ways to hack and cheat with bring-your-own-device electronic examinations|journal=British Journal of Educational Technology|date=17 February 2015|doi=10.1111/bjet.12246|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjet.12246/abstract;jsessionid=592CEB526962F62C7EC35EE6724F0D51.f02t03?userIsAuthenticated=false&amp;deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two common types of academic dishonesty are [[identity fraud]] and [[plagiarism]].

Identity fraud can occur in the traditional or online classroom. There is a higher chance in online classes due to the lack of proctored exams or instructor-student interaction. In a traditional classroom, instructors have the opportunity to get to know the students, learn their writing styles or use proctored exams. To prevent identity fraud in an online class, instructors can use proctored exams through the institutions testing center or require students to come in at a certain time for the exam. Correspondence through the phone or video conferencing techniques can allow an instructor to become familiar with a student through their voice and appearance. Another option would be personalize assignments to students backgrounds or current activities. This allows the student to apply it to their personal life and gives the instructor more assurance the actual student is completing the assignment. Lastly, an instructor may not make the assignments heavily weighted so the students do not feel as pressured.&lt;ref name=Rovai2008/&gt;{{rp|89–90}}

Plagiarism is the misrepresentation of another person's work.  It is easy to copy and paste from the internet or retype directly from a source. It is not only the exact wordage, but the thought or idea.&lt;ref name=Rovai2008/&gt;{{rp|90}}
It is important to learn to properly cite a source when using someone else's work.

==Interoperability==
To assist sharing of assessment items across disparate systems, global standards such as the IMS Question and Test Interoperability specification ([[QTI]]) have emerged.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9867">'''Ethics and religious culture''' ('''Éthique et culture religieuse''') is a course taught in all elementary and high schools in [[Quebec]]. It replaces the abolished subject of religious/moral education in these schools and is compulsory in all schools: private as well as public. The aim of the subject is to develop ethical thinking and dialog skills in response to the changing religious/ non religious diversity of cultural communities in the Province. It also allows for all students to understand Quebec's religious history. ( MELS ERC Curriculum LEARN QUEBEC) The program's twin paramount principles are Recognition of Others and Pursuit of the Common Good. It is also claimed that the course will promote a "culture of dialogue" among students.

The project was adopted under the liberal government of [[Jean Charest]], and has garnered some controversy.  The first year this course has been taught is 2008-2009.

== Controversy ==

The course has been opposed by three main groups:

# Secularists from the Mouvement laïque québécois because they believe that ethics and religious culture should not be taught within a single course ;  also, they believe that teaching both of these subjects together induce people to think that it is not possible to behave ethically without any religious belief ;
# French nationalists who accuse the program to be a kind of ''Multiculturalism 101'';&amp;nbsp;[http://www.action-nationale.qc.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=808&amp;Itemid=1 (See this Action Nationale article.)]
# A coalition of parents drawn from different denominations (the Coalition pour la liberté en éducation) which condemn the course for different reasons: they see it as relativistic, contrary to their faith.

Many condemned the fact that the State is imposing a vision of morals and religion (or lack thereof), which has traditionally been the purview of parents.

== Court cases ==

Two legal challenges were launched against the compulsory nature of this course.

=== Public school exemption ===
A court case against the ERC curriculum was heard from the 11th to the 15th of May, 2009 in Quebec’s Superior Court in Drummondville. Two Catholic parents were challenging the school’s refusal of an exemption for both their first grader and their sixteen-year-old who was in last year of high school. They were arguing that the course’s contents put their children’s faith at risk by being premature, relativistic and polytheistic, and teaching ethics detached from the parents' moral framework. It was seen as a test case for Quebec parents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pouruneecolelibre.blogspot.com/2009/05/details-sur-le-premier-proces-ecr.html Motion text, verbatim and reports here] (in French).&lt;/ref&gt;

The parents lost their court case and decided to bring their cause to the Supreme Court of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.globaltv.com/entertainment/Quebec+couple+takes+mandatory+ethics+course+Canada+court/2960927/story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Supreme Court ====

The Supreme Court granted the parents leave to appeal, but on hearing the merits determined that the appellants were unable to prove their case.

The case was heard on the 18th of May 2011 by the highest tribunal in Canada. A summary of the legal issues at stake&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/case-dossier/cms-sgd/sum-som-eng.aspx?cas=33678&lt;/ref&gt; is listed on the Supreme Court's site. The parents' factum is to be found here.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/factums-memoires/33678/FM010_Appelants_S.-L.-et-D.-J._%C3%A9pur%C3%A9.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Apart from the original parties, 8 additional parties were granted the status of interveners (a pointer is supplied to the party's factum):
# Christian Legal Fellowship;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coalition-cle.org/media/memoire/FCSQ.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
# Canadian Civil Liberties Association;&lt;ref&gt;http://pouruneecolelibre.blogspot.com/2011/05/ecr-memoire-de-lassociation-canadienne.html&lt;/ref&gt;
# Coalition pour la liberté en éducation;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coalition-cle.org/media/memoire/CLE.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; # Evangelical Fellowship of Canada;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coalition-cle.org/media/memoire/AEC-EFC.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
# Regroupement chrétien pour le droit parental en éducation;&lt;ref&gt;http://pouruneecolelibre.blogspot.com/2011/05/ecr-memoire-du-regroupement-chretien.html&lt;/ref&gt;
# Canadian Council of Christian Charities;&lt;ref&gt;http://pouruneecolelibre.blogspot.com/2011/05/erc-at-supreme-court-attorney-general.html&lt;/ref&gt;
# Fédération des commissions scolaires du Québec&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coalition-cle.org/media/memoire/FCSQ.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (did not present oral arguments);
# Canadian Catholic School Trustees' Association.&lt;ref&gt;http://pouruneecolelibre.blogspot.com/2011/05/erc-at-supreme-court-of-canada-strongly.html&lt;/ref&gt;
The Evangelical Fellowship of Canada wrote [http://files.efc-canada.net/si/Education/LavalleeQA.pdf a FAQ in layman's terms] explaining what it saw as the issues at stake and how this court case differs from the Loyola one.
Two court reports were published, one in English by a writer of the [http://www.catholicregister.org/canada/quebec-parents-challenge-ethics-and-religious-culture-course Catholic register], another [http://pouruneecolelibre.blogspot.com/2011/05/le-programme-ecr-en-cour-supreme-du.html more detailed in French] by a parent in favour of parents being exempt of this course if they so wish.

The Supreme Court heard the case and ruled that "...[the court] cannot conclude that the appellants have been able to prove their case." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2012/02/16/supreme-court-canada-religion-education-challenge.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The parents were awarded the Catholics Civil Right League's yearly award&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccrl.ca/index.php?id=5121&lt;/ref&gt; for their defense of parents' free choice in education.

=== Private school exemption ===

A private Catholic high school, Loyola High School in Montreal, also launched a court challenge. Loyola High was challenging the fact that the Ministry of Education has not allowed it to teach what it deems an equivalent ethics and religion course better fitting the Catholic outlook of the school. It alleged that the Ministry had done so despite provisions in the law that would allow such an equivalent course.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pouruneecolelibre.blogspot.com/2009/05/details-sur-le-second-proces-ecr-loyola.html French] and [http://pouruneecolelibre.blogspot.com/2009/06/loyola-explains-why-it-is-in-court-this.html English]&lt;/ref&gt;

Loyola High won its court case and is now exempt for the ERC course and may teach its equivalent Catholic course. On the 18th of June 2010, Superior Court Justice Gerard Dugre compared the attempt of the education minister to impose a secular emphasis on Loyola High School's teaching of the course to the intolerance of the Spanish Inquisition: "The obligation imposed on Loyola to teach the ethics and religious culture course in a lay fashion assumes a totalitarian character essentially equivalent to Galileo's being ordered by the Inquisition to deny the Copernican universe," the judge wrote in [http://www.coalition-cle.org/media/Jugement-Loyola.pdf his 63-page decision]&lt;ref&gt;https://montrealgazette.com/life/Ruling+calls+imposition+ethics+class+totalitarian/3177787/story.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;, &lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;https://montrealgazette.com/life/Court+backs+Loyola+over+ethics+course/3173865/story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Surveys ==

Several polls had shown the Quebec population to be polarized around this course. While 45% opposed the course in October 2008, 72% wanted parents to be able to choose the moral and religious training their children will get at school: the new ERC course or a traditional denominational religion course.&lt;ref&gt;[http://matin.branchez-vous.com/nouvelles/2008/09/52_dappui_au_cours_dethique_et.html][http://www.newswire.ca/fr/releases/archive/October2008/23/c9151.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009, the proportion of Quebecers wanting this choice had risen to 76%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newswire.ca/fr/releases/archive/May2009/26/c7735.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jewish community response ==

On May 28, 2009, the [[Canadian Jewish News]] announced the formation of a grassroots organization to represent "a response of Orthodox Judaism to the Ethics and Religious Culture program." The organization, calling itself the Council on Jewish Education in Quebec, commended the Quebec government for championing the cause of universal friendship among human beings, and for identifying "Recognition of Others" and "Pursuit of the Common Good" as values to be taught.  However, the organization contended that because Orthodox Jews are required according to Torah law to limit their study of theology to the theology of the Torah, the curriculum should consist of the [[Noahide]] Code.  The "Hade'ah Vihaddibur" online Orthodox Jewish weekly newspaper reported a comparable sentiment expressed by the Israeli halakhic decisor [[Yosef Shalom Eliashiv]]. Consistent with this response, the [[Montreal Gazette]], in an op/ed published on June 6, 2009 (p. B6), noted that Quebec Jewish school curricula are exclusively loyal to the theology of the Torah.

'''Facila''' is a training program, in Southern Europe, for adults with short primary schooling. The objective is to prepare students for validation processes and secondary education. Many participants are [[entrepreneurs]], owners or employees of small and medium enterprises, [[Small and medium enterprises|SME]]:s. In these cases the program provides opportunity for training in [[entrepreneurship]] and "[[continuous improvement]]" to enhance the participant's [[employability]].

The program started in 2007 as a cooperation between [[Sweden]] and [[Portugal]]. It is based on the Swedish program "Kunskapslyftet" and adapted to Southern European conditions on an initiative by Johan Frisk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evta.net/evta_tube/facila.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723122815/http://www.evta.net/evta_tube/facila.html |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }} Presentation, European Vocational Training Federation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dn.se/nyheter/varlden/utbildning-ska-radda-portugal-1.1221990 Dagens Nyheter (Swedish Newspaper)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=3304&amp;artikel=3497424 Sveriges Radio (Swedish public radio)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ww1.rtp.pt/multimedia/progVideo.php?tvprog=24786&amp;idpod=37314 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130202412/http://ww1.rtp.pt/multimedia/progVideo.php?tvprog=24786 |archivedate=2010-11-30 |df= }} "Iniciativa", min 37:30-41:30 RTP2 (Portuguese public television)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euractiv.com/en/enterprise-jobs/can-entrepreneurship-be-taught-news-494547 Interview "EuroActiv"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coaching World June 2010 p12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tsf.sapo.pt/PaginaInicial/AudioeVideo.aspx?content_id=1599197 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809030549/http://tsf.sapo.pt/paginainicial/AudioeVideo.aspx?content_id=1599197 |archivedate=2010-08-09 |df= }} "Qualificar a população adulta activa" TSF (Portuguese radio)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theopenmanager.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207234933/http://www.theopenmanager.com/ |date=2011-02-07 }} Blog "The Open Manager"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuous improvement projects==
Apart from basic training, the main objective of the [http://www.facila.eu/english/ Facila] program is to teach students how to prepare  improvement projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tsf.sapo.pt/PaginaInicial/AudioeVideo.aspx?content_id=1603152 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810050714/http://tsf.sapo.pt/paginainicial/AudioeVideo.aspx?content_id=1603152 |archivedate=2010-08-10 |df= }} radio program in Portuguese, "Mãos à Obra" (TSF) interview with the training coordinator&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projectos de melhoria contínua==
O ponto fulcral do processo formativo são os projectos de melhoria.&lt;ref&gt;https://tsf.sapo.pt/PaginaInicial/AudioeVideo.aspx?content_id=1603152 programa rádio, "Mãos à Obra" (TSF) entrevista com a coordenadora da formação&lt;/ref&gt; Cada formando é convidado an analisar o seu posto de trabalho,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iefp.pt/iefp/publicacoes/Formar/Paginas/Formar2008.aspx Formar-revista para formadores nº65, p11-14 (IEFP)&lt;/ref&gt; aplicar componentes da Matemática para a Vida, procurar padrões e traduzi-los para a linguagem matemática. O procedimento permite aumento de produtividade e assim o aumento da [[empregabilidade]] do formando. Se a mesma metodologia é aplicada por donos de pequenas empresas, o resultado do processo leva an aumentos do [[empreendedorismo]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Método formativo==
A metodologia contempla duas vertentes fundamentais, individual e social. O processo de orientar adultos, a [[Andragogia|andragogia]], serve de base para depois construir sobre os conhecimentos existentes de cada participante. O processo social constitui a pedra angular na [[Capacitação|capacitação]] de formandos adultos, a convicção de ser capaz, o [[Teoria da atribuição#Locus de causalidade|"locus interno"]], an inter-ajuda inspirada na pesquisa do Professor [[Sugata Mitra]], são todos componentes do importante "coaching de grupos" que caracteriza o programa Facila.

==Financiamento==
Este projecto é apoiado pelo [http://www.poph.qren.pt/ Programa Operacional de Potencial Humano (POPH)] na medida 2.3, formações modulares certificadas. Como em muitos programas comunitários, o POPH é financiado com verbas oriundas do [[Fundo Social Europeu]] (75%) e o Orçamento do Estado Português (25%).

==Quadro Nacional de Qualificações==
Como consequência da [[Estratégia de Lisboa]] há uma nova visão sobre conhecimento, uma visão mais preocupada com as evidências do que propriamente com o percurso da sua obtenção. Em Portugal, o [http://www.catalogo.anq.gov.pt/Home/QNQ Quadro Nacional de Qualificações] pretende regularizar e valorizar os conhecimentos obtidos por vias não formais e informais.

O programa Facila, com a sua função na preparação de formandos para o processo de [[Rvcc|reconhecimento e validação]] da iniciativa [[Novas Oportunidades]], pretende contribuir para a qualificação de adultos europeus.

One interviewee told the researchers: "It would have been helpful to really know to what extent things still haven’t changed for women.&amp;nbsp;...

'''Higher education''' (also called post-secondary education, third-level or [[tertiary education]]) is an optional final stage of [[formal learning]] that occurs after completion of [[secondary education]]. Often delivered at [[University|universities]], [[Academy|academies]], [[college]]s, [[seminary|seminaries]], [[school of music|conservatories]], and [[institute of technology|institutes of technology]], higher education is also available through certain college-level institutions, including [[vocational school]]s, trade schools, and other career colleges that award [[academic degree]]s or [[professional certification]]s. [[Tertiary education]] at non-degree level is sometimes referred to as [[further education]] or [[continuing education]] as distinct from higher education. The right of access to higher education is mentioned in a number of [[international human rights instruments]]. The [[United Nations|UN]] [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] of 1966 declares, in Article 13, that "higher education shall be made equally accessible to all, on the basis of capacity, by every appropriate means, and in particular by the progressive introduction of free education". In [[Europe]], Article 2 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights|First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights]], adopted in 1950, obliges all signatory parties to guarantee the [[right to education]].

In the days when few pupils progressed beyond [[primary education]] or [[basic education]], the term "higher education" was often used to refer to secondary education, which can create some confusion.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Higher Education: General and Technical'', a 1933 [[National Union of Teachers]] pamphlet by [[Lord Eustace Percy]], which is actually about secondary education and uses the two terms interchangeably.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the origin of the term ''[[High school (North America)|high school]]'' for various schools for children between the ages of 14 and 18 (United States) or 11 and 18 (UK and Australia).&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/high-school?a=british ]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RupertI.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|[[Rupert I, Elector Palatine|Rupert I]] founded the [[University of Heidelberg]] in 1386]]
Higher education includes teaching, research, exacting applied work (e.g. in [[medical school]]s and [[dental school]]s), and social services activities of universities.&lt;ref&gt;Pucciarelli F., Kaplan Andreas M. (2016) Competition and Strategy in Higher Education: Managing Complexity and Uncertainty, Business Horizons, Volume 59&lt;/ref&gt; Within the realm of teaching, it includes both the ''[[undergraduate education|undergraduate]]'' level, and beyond that, ''[[Postgraduate education|graduate-level]]'' (or ''postgraduate'' level). The latter level of education is often referred to as [[graduate school]], especially in North America. In addition to the skills that are specific to any particular degree, potential employers in any profession are looking for evidence of [[critical thinking]] and [[analytical reasoning]] skills, [[teamwork]]ing skills, [[information literacy]], [[Ethics|ethical]] judgment, [[decision-making]] skills, fluency in speaking and writing, [[problem solving]] skills, and a wide knowledge of liberal arts and sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

Since [[World War II]], developed and many developing countries have increased the participation of the age group who mostly studies higher education from the elite rate, of up to 15 per cent, to the mass rate of 16 to 50 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;Trow, Martin (1973) Problems in the transition from elite to mass higher education.

== History ==
{{main|History of higher education in the United States}}
The U.S. system of higher education was heavily influenced by the [[Humboldtian model of higher education]]. [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]'s educational model goes beyond vocational training. In a letter to the Prussian king, he wrote:

{{quote|There are undeniably certain kinds of knowledge that must be of a general nature and, more importantly, a certain cultivation of the mind and character that nobody can afford to be without. People obviously cannot be good craftworkers, merchants, soldiers or businessmen unless, regardless of their occupation, they are good, upstanding and – according to their condition – well-informed human beings and citizens. If this basis is laid through schooling, vocational skills are easily acquired later on, and a person is always free to move from one occupation to another, as so often happens in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02192965|title=Profiles of educators: Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767–1835)|journal=Prospects|volume=18|pages=127–136|year=1988|last1=Günther|first1=Karl-Heinz}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The philosopher [[Julian Nida-Rümelin]] criticized discrepancies between Humboldt's ideals and the contemporary European education policy, which narrowly understands education as a preparation for the labor market, and argued that we need to decide between [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey]] and Humboldt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.zeit.de/2009/45/Bachelor-Kritik|title=Bologna-Prozess: Die Chance zum Kompromiss ist da|last=Nida-Rümelin|first=Julian|date=29 October 2009|work=[[Die Zeit]]|language=German|access-date=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entrance standards: reading, mathematics, and writing==

Demonstrated ability in reading, mathematics, and writing, as typically measured in the United States by the [[SAT]] or similar tests such as the [[ACT (test)|ACT]], have often replaced colleges' individual entrance exams, and is often required for admission to higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/26/education/edlife/26guidance-t.html|title=The Other Side of 'Test Optional'|last=O'Shaughnessy|first=Lynn|date=26 July 2009|work=The New York Times|page=6|accessdate=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some question as to whether advanced mathematical skills or talent are in fact necessary for fields such as history, English, philosophy, or art.&lt;ref name=NYT72812&gt;{{cite news|title=Is Algebra Necessary?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/opinion/sunday/is-algebra-necessary.html|accessdate=July 29, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 28, 2012|author=Andrew Hacker|authorlink=Andrew Hacker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===General===
The general higher education and training that takes place in a [[university]], [[college]], or [[Institute of technology]] usually includes significant [[theory|theoretical]] and abstract elements, as well as applied aspects (although limited offerings of [[internship]]s or [[Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF)|SURF]] programs attempt to provide practical applications). In contrast, the vocational higher education and training that takes place at [[vocational university|vocational universities and schools]] usually concentrates on [[practice (learning method)|practical applications]], with very little theory.

In addition, [[professional]]-level education is always included within Higher Education, and usually in [[graduate school]]s since many [[postgraduate education|postgraduate]] [[List of academic disciplines|academic disciplines]] are both vocationally, professionally, and theoretically/research oriented, such as in the [[law]], [[medicine]], [[pharmacy]], [[dentistry]], and [[veterinary medicine]]. A basic requirement for entry into these graduate-level programs is almost always a bachelor's degree, although [[alternative pathways in education|alternative means]] of obtaining entry into such programs may be available at some universities. Requirements for admission to such high-level graduate programs is extremely competitive, and admitted students are expected to perform well.

When employers in any profession consider hiring a college graduate, they are looking for evidence of [[critical thinking]], [[analytical reasoning]] skills, [[teamwork]]ing skills, [[information literacy]], [[Ethics|ethical]] judgment, [[decision-making]] skills, [[Communication studies|communication skills]] (using both text and speech), [[problem solving]] skills, and a wide knowledge of liberal arts and sciences. However, most employers consider the average graduate to be more or less deficient in all of these areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

In the United States, there are large differences in wages and employment associated with different degrees. Medical doctors and lawyers are generally the highest paid workers, and have among the lowest unemployment rates. Among undergraduate fields of study, science, technology, engineering, math, and business generally offer the highest wages and best chances of employment, while education, communication, and liberal arts degrees generally offer lower wages and a lower likelihood of employment.&lt;ref name="Simkovic" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| title =The Economic Value of College Majors| publisher =Georgetown University| date =May 2015| url =https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/valueofcollegemajors/| accessdate =17 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Liberal arts ====
{{Main|Liberal arts college}}

Academic areas that are included within the [[liberal arts]] include [[environmental science]], [[great books]], [[history]], [[language]]s including English, [[linguistics]], [[literature]], [[mathematics]], [[Music education|music]], [[philosophy]], [[political science]], [[psychology]], [[religious studies]], [[science]], [[sociology]] and [[Drama school|theater]].

==== Engineering ====
{{Main|Engineering college}}

Teaching engineering is teaching the application of scientific, economic, social, and practical knowledge in order to design, build, maintain, and improve structures, machines, devices, systems, materials and processes. It may encompass using insights to conceive, model and scale an appropriate solution to a problem or objective. The discipline of engineering is extremely broad, and encompasses a range of more specialized fields of engineering, each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of technology and types of application. Engineering disciplines include [[aerospace]], [[biological]], [[Civil engineering|civil]], [[chemical]], [[Computer engineering|computer]], [[electrical]], [[Industrial engineering|industrial]], and [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]].

====Performing arts====
{{Main|Performing arts education}}

The [[performing arts]] differ from the [[plastic arts]] or [[visual arts]], insofar as the former uses the artist's own body, face and presence as a medium; the latter uses materials such as clay, metal or paint, which can be molded or transformed to create a [[work of art]].

Performing arts institutions include [[:Category:Circus schools|circus schools]], [[Dance studio|dance schools]], [[drama school]]s and [[music school]]s.

====Plastic or visual arts====
{{Main|Art education|Art school}}

The [[plastic arts]] or [[visual arts]] are a class of [[Art#Art forms|art forms]], that involve the use of materials, that can be moulded or modulated in some way, often in three dimensions. Examples are [[painting]], [[sculpture]], and [[drawing]].

Higher educational institutions in these arts include [[film school]]s and [[List of art schools|art schools]].

===Vocational===
{{Main|Vocational university|Vocational school|Technical school}}

Higher vocational education and training takes place at the non-university tertiary level. Such education combines teaching of both practical skills and theoretical expertise. Higher education differs from other forms of post-secondary education such as that offered by institutions of [[vocational education]], which are more colloquially known as [[vocational school|trade schools]]. Higher vocational education might be contrasted with education in a usually broader [[science|scientific]] field, which might concentrate on [[theory]] and abstract [[concept]]ual knowledge.

===Professional higher education===
This describes a distinct form of higher education that offers a particularly intense integration with the world of work in all its aspects (including teaching, learning, research and governance) and at all levels of the overarching Qualifications Framework of the European Higher Education Area. Its function is to diversify learning opportunities, enhance employability, offer qualifications and stimulate innovation, for the benefit of learners and society.

The intensity of integration with the world of work (which includes enterprise, civil society and the public sector) is manifested by a strong focus on application of learning. This approach involves combining phases of work and study, a concern for employability, cooperation with employers, the use of practice-relevant knowledge and use-inspired research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://haphe.eurashe.eu|title = Harmonising Approaches to Professional Higher Education in Europe|date = 2013|accessdate = 2014-10-17|website = Harmonising Approaches to Professional Higher Education in Europe|publisher = EURASHE|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of providers of professional higher education may include graduate colleges of [[architecture]], [[Business school|business]], [[Journalism school|journalism]], [[Law school|law]], [[Library school|library science]], [[optometry]], [[Pharmacy school|pharmacy]], [[Public policy school|public policy]], [[Medical school|human medicine]], [[Engineering education|professional engineering]], [[Podiatric medical school|podiatric medicine]], [[Dental school|scientific dentistry]], [[K-12 education]], and [[Veterinary school|veterinary medicine]].

===Statistics===
A report titled 'Education at a Glance 2014' published by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] on 9 September 2014, revealed that by 2014, 84 percent of young people were completing upper secondary education over their lifetimes, in high-income countries. Tertiary-educated individuals were earning twice as much as median workers. In contrast to historical trends in education, young women were more likely to complete upper secondary education than young men.  Additionally, access to education was expanding and growth in the number of people receiving university education was rising sharply. By 2014, close to 40 percent of people aged 25–34 (and around 25 percent of those aged 55–64), were being educated at university.&lt;ref name="ReportOECD"&gt;{{cite news|title=Higher levels of education paying off for young, says OECD|url=http://www.oecd.org/edu/eag.htm |date=September 2014 |accessdate=September 11, 2014|author=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition of studies==
The [[Lisbon Recognition Convention]] stipulates that degrees and periods of study must be recognised in all of the Signatory Parties of the Convention.

==As employers==
[[File:2015-04-23 Kirylo Cope DSC0072.jpg|upright=1.1|right|thumb|University governance generally involves input from the Faculty. Here [[James D. Kirylo]], president of [[Southeastern Louisiana University]]'s [[Academic senate|Faculty Senate]] confers with Kevin L. Cope, president of the [[LSU]] Faculty Senate and president of the Association of Louisiana Faculty Senates, during a 2015 panel presentation in [[Hammond, Louisiana|Hammond]] on university funding issues for [[Fiscal Year]] 2016.]]
Universities may employ a number of people. Depending on the funding, a university typically hires one teacher per 3–25 students. According to the ideal of research-university, the university teaching staff is actively involved in the research of the institution. In addition, the university usually also has dedicated research staff and a considerable support staff. Typically to work in higher education as a member of the academic [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]], a candidate must first obtain a doctorate in an academic field, although some lower teaching positions require only a master's degree.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Most of the administrative staff works in different administrative sections, such as [[Student Affairs]].{{citation needed|reason=This appears 'top of the head'. Really needs citation and more university 'sections'.|date=November 2011}} In addition, there may be central support units, such as a university [[library]] which have a dedicated staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cornell University Library Staff Web|url=http://staffweb.library.cornell.edu/|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The professional field involving the collection, analysis, and reporting of higher education data is called [[institutional research]]. Professionals in this field can be found at locations in addition to universities, e.g. state educational departments.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Post-secondary institutions also employ graduate students in various assistantship roles.  In the US, close to 50% of graduate students are employed as graduate assistants at some point.  These apprenticeship-like positions provide opportunities for students to gain experience in, and exposure to, professional roles in exchange for funding of their academic programs.&lt;ref&gt;Haley, K., Hephner LaBanc, B., &amp; Koutas, P. (2011). New school, new job, new life: Transitions of graduate assistants in student affairs. Journal of College Orientation and Transition, 18(2), 5 - 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent controversy ==
From the early 1950s to the present, more and more people in the United States have gone on to pursue degrees or certificates of higher education. However this has sparked some debate in recent years as some advocates say that a degree is not what it was once worth to employers. To clarify some advocates say that the financial costs that universities require from their students  has gone up so dramatically that it is leaving many students in debt of loans of an average of $37,172&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://studentloanhero.com/student-loan-debt-statistics/|title=U.S. Student Loan Debt Statistics for 2017 {{!}} Student Loan Hero|work=Student Loan Hero|access-date=2017-12-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to 2000, where the average debt students graduated with was $16,928.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2002/03/08/college/q_studentdebt/|title=Student debt increasingly unmanagable - Mar. 8, 2002|website=money.cnn.com|access-date=2017-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States there is an estimated 44 million Americans with a combined $1.3 trillion student loan debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2017/02/21/student-loan-debt-statistics-2017/#50c1f4f05dab|title=Student Loan Debt In 2017: A $1.3 Trillion Crisis|last=Friedman|first=Zack|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-12-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates advise parents to not send their children to college unless these children are committed to pursuing their future education. An increasing number of freshman every year drop out of their perspective programs or do not possess the maturity to have a balanced life away from home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Some Career Pathways Require a Four-Year Degree, Many Don't - US News|url = https://www.usnews.com/debate-club/is-a-college-degree-still-worth-it/some-career-pathways-require-a-four-year-degree-many-dont|website = US News &amp; World Report|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However statistics from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate that the college educated are employed at a rate nearly twice that of the national average when compared to high school graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|url = http://www.bls.gov/|website = www.bls.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The type of degree one pursues will determine how safe and prosperous his/her career path is. A study published by the Pew Charitable Trusts, shows that among Americans ages 21 to 24, the drop in employment and income was much steeper among people who lacked a college degree. "Among those whose highest degree was a high school diploma, only 55% had jobs even before the downturn, and that fell to 47% after it. For young people with an associates degree, the employment rate fell from 64 to 57. Bachelor's degree slipped from 69 to 65."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Study Shows College Degree's Value During Economic Downturn|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/10/education/study-shows-college-degrees-value-during-economic-downturn.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2013-01-09|access-date = 2015-10-11|issn = 0362-4331|first = Richard|last = Pérez-peña}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Lisa Kahn of Yale stated that people who graduated from college in the most recent recession were in a position to gain better security than others.

Ultimately a survey, the Great Jobs and Great Lives Gallup-Purdue Index report &lt;!-- (what year?) released in May --&gt; found the type of college that students attend and in some cases even majors they choose have very little to do with their overall success and well-being later in life. What matters more, the index found, is feeling supported and making emotional connections during school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = College Grads Question How Much a Degree Is Worth|url = https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/02/10/college-grads-question-the-return-on-investment-of-todays-degrees|website = US News &amp; World Report|date = 2015-02-10|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''iSpring Suite''' is a [[rapid learning]] [[Authoring system|authoring toolkit]] produced by iSpring for developing training  courses in [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] with embedded (or standalone) quizzes, surveys, and interactions. Its output is compatible with mainstream [[Learning management system|LMS]] standards ([[SCORM]]/[[Aviation Industry Computer-Based Training Committee|AICC]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.moodle.org/22/en/Creating_SCORM_Content|title=Creating SCORM Content|work=docs.moodle.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ispringsolutions.com/articles/lms_support.html|title=LMS support|work=ispringsolutions.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and there is also an option to publish courses specially for [[Blackboard Learning System|BlackBoard LMS]]. The new [[Tin Can API|xAPI (Tin Can)]] format for [[Learning Record Store|LRSes]] is supported as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tincanapi.com/adopters|title=Adopters|work=tincanapi.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Output can be a solid [[SWF| SWF file(s)]], [[EXE| EXE file]], [[HTML]] page or [[Zip (file format)|ZIP]] archive. Additionally, the cross-platform output format ([[Adobe Flash|Flash]] + [[HTML5]]) allows published content to be viewed on any type of modern device.

==History==
In 2005, Flashspring Pro, the prototype of all iSpring products, was released. It was a simple PowerPoint-to-Flash converter with free and commercial versions. Later, iSpring released Flashspring Ultra and [[Sharable Content Object Reference Model|SCORM]] compatibility became available. The companion products FlashSpring Lite and FlashSpring Server were released in 2006 and 2007, respectively. In 2008 the name was changed to iSpring. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learningsolutionsmag.com/articles/745/making-sense-of-powerpoint-pandemonium|title=Making Sense of PowerPoint Pandemonium|work=learningsolutionsmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The current version of iSpring Suite, iSpring Suite 9.0, came out in April 24th, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://elearningindustry.com/press-releases/ispring-suite-9-fast-toolkit-creating-elearning-slides-quizzes-videos|title=iSpring Suite 9: Fast Toolkit For Creating eLearning Slides, Quizzes, And Videos|work=elearningindustry.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===iSpring Suite 7===
One enhancement made to iSpring Suite 7 was the support of combined, cross-platform [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] + [[HTML5]] format. It allowed users to create mobile-ready projects that adapt to any screen size and orientation.

iSpring Suite 7 came with free mobile apps for iOS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ispring-viewer/id642452385?mt=8|title=iSpring Viewer on the App Store on iTunes|work=[[iOS App Store]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Android,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ispringsolutions.mplayer&amp;hl=en |title=iSpring Mobile Player - Android Apps |via=[[Google Play]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; which allow offline content viewing. The apps collect statistics on learning activity even with no Internet connection and send them to an LMS once the connection is restored.

===iSpring Suite 8===
iSpring Suite 8 introduces several new features to the toolkit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learningsolutionsmag.com/articles/1804/ispring-suite-8-massive-new-features-not-found-in-standard-elearning-packages|title=iSpring Suite 8: Massive New Features Not Found in Standard eLearning Packages|work=learningsolutionsmag.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In version 8, a conversation simulator was added, allowing users to create simulated dialogues. Also, iSpring Suite 8 has a screen recording tool, allowing users to capture the screen and insert the recording on a PowerPoint slide, an audio/video editor both for screen recordings and audio/video narrations, and a video lecture player to show PowerPoint slides and lecture video side by side.

=== iSpring Suite 9 ===
Released in April 2018, the 9th version introduced 14 new interactions, a new built-in video editor with extended capabilities for screen recording, and major improvements of the quiz editor: the new [[Drag and drop|drag-and-drop]] question, the new built-in [[equation]] editor, extended feedback options, and 7 new survey question templates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.learningsolutionsmag.com/articles/toolkit-ispring-suite-9-adds-a-lot-of-great-new-features|title=Toolkit: iSpring Suite 9 Adds a Lot of Great New Features|work=learningsolutionsmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
iSpring Suite includes 5 authoring components: the iSpring add-in, iSpring QuizMaker, conversation simulator, screen recording tool and iSpring Visuals — a set of standalone tools that can be used both separately and together. Additional components available in the publishing interface are PowerPoint-to-Video/YouTube (available separately as iSpring SlideAlloy), and iSpring Cloud hosting and sharing platform.

===iSpring Converter Pro===
iSpring Converter Pro turns PowerPoint projects into mobile-ready online presentations. It supports the standard PowerPoint features such as animation, transition effects and narration facilities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/10things/10-cool-add-ins-for-office-2007-and-2010/2455|title=10 cool add-ins for Office 2007 and 2010|work=techrepublic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contains additional features that aren't provided by PowerPoint, such as publishing to the Web or an [[Learning Management System|LMS]]. 

===iSpring QuizMaker===
iSpring QuizMaker allows users to create quizzes and surveys.

===iSpring Visuals===
iSpring Visuals adds rich media [[Interaction model|interactions]] to PowerPoint presentations.

===iSpring TalkMaster===
iSpring TalkMaster is a conversation simulator that allows users to create simulated dialogues for customer support training and other purposes.

===iSpring ScreenRecorder===
iSpring ScreenRecorder allows users to capture all or part of a screen and insert the recording on a PowerPoint slide, save it to MP4 video, or publish it to a YouTube account.

===iSpring SlideAlloy===
iSpring SlideAlloy converts PowerPoint presentations to videos in .mp4 format, or publishes them to YouTube.

===iSpring Cloud===
iSpring Cloud is a hosting and delivery platform for PowerPoint presentations, Microsoft documents and spreadsheets, images, video, audio, and PDF files.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1371">The '''Illinois School Report Card''' is a measurement of school performance administered by the [[Illinois State Board of Education]]. Each [[public school district]] in [[Illinois]], including special charter districts, must submit to parents, taxpayers, the Governor, the General Assembly and the State Board of Education a school report card assessing the performance of its schools and students. The report card is an index of school performance measured against statewide and local standards and provides information to make prior year comparisons and to set future year targets through the school improvement plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isbe.net/research/pdfs/rc09_def.pdf|title=2009 Report Card Definitions and Sources of Data|date=2009|publisher=Illinois State Board of Education, Division of Data Analysis and Progress Reporting|accessdate=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Instructional animations''' are [[animation]]s that are used either to provide instructions for immediate performance of a task or to support more permanent [[education|learning]] of subject matter. While both of these uses can be described as instructional animations, when the goal is to support learning, the term [[educational animation]] may be preferred.

'''International students''' are those students who chose to undertake all or part of their tertiary education in a country other than their own and move to that country for the specific purpose of studying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wb|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20090917182725104|title=What defines and international student|publisher=University World News|date=20 September 2009|access-date=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016, there were nearly 5.1 million internationally mobile students (i.e. 2.3% of all tertiary students), up from 2.1 million in 2000.&lt;ref name=UIS&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.uis.unesco.org/index.aspx?queryid=169|title= Inbound internationally mobile students by continent of origin|author=[[UNESCO]] Institute for Statistics|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States and United Kingdom attracted one-third of all international students in 2000, falling to 28% in 2016.&lt;ref name=UIS /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Choudaha|first=Rahul|date=March 2017|title=Three waves of international student mobility (1999-2020)|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4RmnCsexL7ZckFpR1FXVFFQZ2M/view|journal=Studies in Higher Education|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1080/03075079.2017.1293872|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National definitions==

The definition of "foreign student" and "international student" varies in each country in accordance to their own national education system. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iie.org/Research-and-Insights/Project-Atlas/Glossary :title=Glossary|publisher=Institute of International Education|access-date=16 November 2018|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the US International students are "Individuals studying in the United States on a non-immigrant, temporary visa that allows for academic study at the post- secondary level. Immigrants, permanent residents, citizens, resident aliens ("Green Card" holders), and refugees are excluded from this definition."

Canada defines international students as "....temporary residents who hve been approved by an immigration officer to study in Canada. The study permit identifies the level of study and the length of time the individual may study in Canada. International students do not need a study permit for courses of six months or less if they will finish the course within the period of stay authorized upon entry, which is usually six months. Every foreign student must have a student authorization, but may also have been issued other types of permits or authorizations."{{cn|date=November 2018}}

In Australia an international student is "A student on a student visa studying in Australia with an institution registered to deliver courses to such students. Students from New Zealand are not included in the student enrolment counts as they do not require a student visa." and in Japan the definition is "A student from a foreign economy who is receiving an education at any Japanese university, graduate school, junior college, college of technology, professional training college or university preparatory course and who resides in Japan with a 'college student' visa status."{{cn|date=November 2018}}

==Destinations of foreign students==
According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in their 2009 World Conference on Higher Education report, Over 2.5 million students were studying outside their home country. UNESCO also predicted that the number of foreign students might rise to approximately 7 million by the year 2020.  The main destinations preferred were the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Canada and Australia. Overall, the number of foreign students more than doubled to over 2 million between 2000 and 2007.&lt;ref name="Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 2010"&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/12/9/45612617.pdf Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 2010].&lt;/ref&gt;

The greatest percentage increases of numbers of foreign students have occurred in New Zealand, Korea, the Netherlands, Greece, Spain, Italy and Ireland.&lt;ref name="Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 2010"/&gt;

Traditionally the U.S and U.K have been the most prestigious choices, because of the presence of top 10 rankings Universities such as Harvard, Oxford, MIT and Cambridge. More recently however they have had to compete with the rapidly growing Asian higher education market. While US is the leading destination for foreign students, there is increasing competition from several destinations in East Asia such as China, Korea, Japan and Taiwan which are keen to attract foreign students for reputation and demographic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dreducation.com/2017/03/Three-Waves-International-Student-Mobility-Choudaha.html|title=Three waves of international student mobility explain the past, present and future trends|website=www.dreducation.com|access-date=2017-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Student mobility in the first decade of the 21st century has been transformed by two major external events, the attack on the New York Trade Centre and the recession of 2008.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;The US to tightened visa requirements for students and Australia and the UK were successful in absorbing most of the growth in nu,mbers of foreign students. In 2009, international students represented 21.5% and 15.3% of higher education enrollment in Australia and the UK, compared to less than 4% in the US, according to the OECD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/edu/eag2011 |title=Education at a Glance |publisher=OECD |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to OECD, almost one out of five foreign students is regionally mobile. This segment of regionally mobile students who seek [http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20130426103907495 global education at local cost is defined as "glocal" students].  Many "glocal" students consider pursuing transnational or cross-border education which allows them to earn a foreign credential while staying in their home countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dreducation.com/2016/05/Transnational-Education-Quality-Growth-Webinar-Recording.html|title=Webinar on Transnational Education: Recording of the Online Discussion with Global Experts ~ DrEducation: Global Higher Education Research and Consulting|last=Choudaha|first=Rahul|website=www.dreducation.com|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the increase in tuition cost in leading destinations like the US and the UK along with the higher immigration barriers, many international students are exploring alternative destinations and demanding more "value for money."[http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20180724145334625]
It is projected that the number of internationally mobile students will reach 6.9 million by 2030, an increase of 51%, or 2.3 million students, from 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20180126131034717|title=Global universities unprepared for sea change ahead|last=|first=|date=26 January 2018|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of US visas issued to Chinese students to study at US universities has increased by 30 per cent, from more than 98,000 in 2009 to nearly 128,000 in October 2010, placing China as the top country of origin for foreign students, according to the "2010 Open Doors Report" published on the US Embassy in China website. 
The number of Chinese students increased. Overall, the total number of foreign students with a US Visa to study at colleges and universities increased by 3 per cent to a record high of nearly 691,000 in the 2009/2010 academic year. 
The 30 per cent increase in Chinese student enrolment was the main contributor to this year's growth, and now Chinese students account for more than 18 percent of the total foreign students.&lt;ref name="Chinese college students flocking to U.S. campuses"&gt;Mary, Beth, Marklein,[https://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2009-12-08-1Achinesestudents08_CV_N.htm "Chinese college students flocking to U.S. campuses"], ''USA Today,'' December 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reasons for coming to China ====
Various factors combine to make China a very desirable destination for international students.

# China boasts a significant number of world-class universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monitor.icef.com/2017/10/china-announces-new-push-elite-university-status/|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|title=China announces new push for elite university status|date=4 October 2017|website=ICEF Monintor|access-date=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Universities in China are attractive research centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/higher-education-in-asia-expanding-out-expanding-up-2014-en.pdf|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|title=Higher Education in Asia: Expanding Out, Expanding Up|date=2014|website=UNESCO|access-date=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Many graduate and postgraduate programs are offered in English.
# A huge number of scholarships (49,022 in 2016) are on offer from the Chinese government.&lt;ref name=MOE/&gt;

China is openly pursuing a policy of growing its [[soft power]] globally, by way of persuasion and attraction. Attracting international students, especially by way of scholarships, is one effective way of growing this influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monitor.icef.com/2016/01/education-and-the-exercise-of-soft-power-in-china/|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|title=Education and the exercise of soft power in China|date=13 January 2016|website=ICEF Monitor|access-date=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1119447/china-is-training-africas-next-generation-of-leaders/|author=Lily Kuo|title=Beijing is cultivating the next generation of African elites by training them in China|date=14 December 2017|website=Quartz Africa|access-date=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan, Canada and New Zealand ===
Japan, Canada and New Zealand are perceived as evolving destinations for international students. In 2006, Japan, Canada and New Zealand together shared roughly 13% of the international student market, with approximately 327,000 of the 2.7 million students who traveled abroad for the purposes of higher education.&lt;ref name="World Education Services"&gt;[http://www.wes.org/educators/pdf/StudentMobility.pdf World Education Services] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214053953/http://www.wes.org/educators/pdf/StudentMobility.pdf|date=2010-12-14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Japan has around 180 000 overseas students studying at its institutions and the government has set targets to increase this to 300, 000 over the next few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studyjapan.go.jp/en/toj/toj09e.html|title=300000 Foreign Students Plan|publisher=|accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada has seen a large increase in the number of Indian students, where the number of Indian students rose 280% in 2010 compared to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher= Economic Times| title = France, Germany &amp; Canada: New overseas education destinations for Indians| url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-05-01/news/29491210_1_indian-students-uk-visa-rules|date = May 1, 2011| accessdate=June 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations such as [[Learnhub]] are taking advantage of this growing trend of Indian international students by providing recruitment services that bring Indian students abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Learnhub| title=Learnhub.com| url=http://learnhub.com/home| date=June 20, 2011| accessdate=June 20, 2011}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, in Canada 10 percent of university students were international students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chao|first=E.

Recent changes to Canada's immigration regulations that came into effect on January 1, 2015 have placed international graduates from Canadian universities at a disadvantage. Under the new rules, foreign students who hold a degree or diploma from Canadian educational institutions will be treated on par with other groups of skilled workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immigration.ca/international-students-seeking-canadian-residence-hit-hard-by-new-express-entry-system/|title=International Students Seeking Canadian Residence Hit Hard by New Express Entry System (Audio)|work=Canadian Citizenship &amp; Immigration Resource Center|accessdate=27 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329070912/http://www.immigration.ca/international-students-seeking-canadian-residence-hit-hard-by-new-express-entry-system/|archivedate=29 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Malaysia, Singapore and India ===
Malaysia, Singapore and India are the emerging destinations for international students. These three countries have combined share of approximately 12% of the global student market with somewhere between 250,000 and 300,000 students having decided to pursue higher education studies in these countries in 2005–2006.&lt;ref name="World Education Services"/&gt;

The flow of international students above indicates the South-North phenomenon. In this sense, students from Asia prefer to pursue their study particularly in the United States.

==Requirements==
Prospective foreign students are usually required to sit for language tests, such as [[Cambridge English: First]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridgeenglish.org/exams/first/|title=Cambridge English: First (FCE)|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cambridge English: Advanced (CAE)|Cambridge English: Advanced]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridgeenglish.org/exams/advanced/|title=Cambridge English: Advanced (CAE)|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cambridge English: Proficiency]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridgeenglish.org/exams/proficiency/|title=Cambridge English: Proficiency (CPE)|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IELTS]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ielts.org/ Ielts.org] (English-speaking education)&lt;/ref&gt; [[TOEFL]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ets.org ETS.org] (English-speaking education)&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Test of English Proficiency|iTEP]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130103181353/http://iteponline.com/en/ iteponline.com] (English-speaking education)&lt;/ref&gt; [[PTE Academic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pearsonpte.com |title=English tests for study abroad, UK, Australia, USA from Pearson |publisher=Pearsonpte.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DELF]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://french.about.com/ About.com] (French-speaking education)&lt;/ref&gt; or [[DELE]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.donquijote.org/english/courses.dele.asp DonQuijote.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416075540/http://www.donquijote.org/english/courses.dele.asp |date=2008-04-16 }} (Spanish-speaking education)&lt;/ref&gt; before they are admitted. Tests notwithstanding, while some international students already possess an excellent command of the local language upon arrival, some find their language ability, considered excellent domestically, inadequate for the purpose of understanding lectures, and/or of conveying oneself fluently in rapid conversations. A research report commissioned by NAFSA: Association of International Educators investigated the scope of third-party providers offerings intensive English preparation programs with academic credit for international students in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dreducation.com/2017/05/pathway-research-international-student-recruitment.html|title=NAFSA research on landscape of third-party pathway partnerships in the US|website=www.dreducation.com|access-date=2017-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pathway programs are designed to recruit and support international students needing additional help with English and academic preparation before matriculating to a degree program.

===Student Visa===
Generally, foreign students as citizens of other countries are required to obtain a student visa, which ascertains their legal status for staying in the second country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Student Visa|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/study-exchange/student.html|website=travel.state.gov|accessdate=16 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603231159/https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/study-exchange/student.html|archive-date=3 June 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, before students come to the country, the students must select a school to attend to qualify for a student visa. The course of study and the type of school a foreign student plans to attend determine whether an [[F visa|F-1 visa]] or an [[M-1 visa]] is needed. Each student visa applicant must prove they have the financial ability to pay for their tuition, books and living expenses while they study in the states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Farrell|first1=Louis|title=How to Demonstrate Financial Ability as an International Student|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/international-student-counsel/2015/04/07/how-to-demonstrate-financial-ability-as-an-international-student|website=U.S.News &amp; World report|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic impact==
Research from the National Association of Foreign Student Advisers (NAFSA) shows the economic benefits of the increasing international higher-education enrollment in the United States. According to their 2013-2014 academic year analysis, international students have contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S economy and 340,000 jobs. This is almost a 12% increase in dollars added to the economy and an 8.5% increase associated with job support and creation compared to the previous year.
International students contribute more than job and monetary gains to the economy. NAFSA Executive Director and CEO Marlene M. Johnson has stated, "[international students] bring global perspectives into U.S. classrooms and research labs, and support U.S. innovation through science and engineering coursework."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How International Students Add Billions to the U.S. Economy|url=http://immigrationimpact.com/2014/11/19/international-students-add-billions-u-s-economy/|accessdate=June 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to NAFSA's research, their diverse views contribute to technological innovation has increased America's ability to compete in the global economy.

==Higher education marketing==
Marketing of higher education is a well-entrenched macro process today, especially in the major English-speaking nations i.e. Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK, and the USA. One of the major factors behind the worldwide evolution of educational marketing could be a result of globalization, which has dramatically shriveled the world. Due to intensifying competition for overseas students amongst MESDCs, i.e. major English-speaking destination countries, higher educational institutions recognize the significance of marketing themselves, in the international arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestcorp.com/international-students.html|title=Wrest Corporation - International Internship &amp; MBA Consultant Delhi|publisher=|accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To build sustainable international student recruitment strategies Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) need to diversify the markets from which they recruit, both to take advantage of future growth potential from emerging markets, and to reduce dependency on – and exposure to risk from – major markets such as China, India and Nigeria, where demand has proven to be volatile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalstudentsurvey.com/2016/|title=International Student Survey|publisher=Hobsons|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For recruitment strategies, there are some approaches that higher education institutions adopt to ensure stable enrollments of international students, such as developing university preparation programs, like the [[Global Assessment Certificate]] (GAC) Program, and launching international branch campuses in foreign countries.

===Global Assessment Certificate (GAC) Program===
The Global Assessment Certification (GAC) Program is a university preparation program, developed and provided by [[ACT (test)|ACT]] Education Solution, Ltd., for the purpose of helping students to prepare for admission and enrolment overseas.&lt;ref name="Open Doors Report"/&gt; Moreover, the program helps students from non-English speaking backgrounds to prepare for university-level study, so they are able to successfully finish a bachelor's degree at university.
This program is primarily getting great attention from non-English-speaking countries like China and South Korea. Students who complete the GAC program have the opportunity to be admitted to 120 universities, so called [http://actinternationalservices.com/en/aesl/pathway.html Pathway Universities], located in popular destinations including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 GAC Pathway University Handbook|url=http://actinternationalservices.com/pdf/pathway.pdf|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mainly, the program consists of curriculums, such as Academic English, Mathematics, Computing, Study Skills, Business, Science and Social Science. Moreover, the program also provides the opportunity to get prepared for the ACT exam and English Proficiency tests like TOEFL and IELTS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is in the Global Assessment Certificate™ program?|url=http://actinternationalservices.com/en/gac/what.html|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign branch campuses===
[[International branch campus]] is a new strategy of recruiting foreign students in other countries in order to build strong global outreach by overcoming the limitations of physical distance. Indeed, opening branch campuses play a significant role of widening the landscape of the higher education. In the past, along with high demand for higher education, many universities in the United States established their branch campuses in foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clifford|first1=Megan|title=Assessing the Feasibility of Foreign Branch Campuses|url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/rgs_dissertations/RGSD300/RGSD354/RAND_RGSD354.pdf|website=rand.org|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report by the Observatory on Borderless Higher Education (OBHE), there was a 43% increase in the number of foreign branch campuses in the worldwide scale since 2006. American higher education institutions mostly take a dominant position in growth rate and the number of foreign branch campuses, accounting for almost 50 percent of current foreign branch campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Becker|first1=Rosa|title=International Branch Campuses: New Trends and Directions|url=https://ejournals.bc.edu/ojs/index.php/ihe/article/viewFile/8464/7598|website=ejournals.bc.edu|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some research reports that recently said foreign branching campuses are facing several challenges and setbacks, for example interference of local government,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=María Eugenia Miranda|title=International Branch Campuses Producing Opportunities, Headaches|url=http://diverseeducation.com/article/64650/)|publisher=Diverse|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
sustainability problems, and long-term prospects like damage on academic reputations and finance.

==The challenges for foreign students in English-speaking countries==
There is a trend for more and more students to go abroad to study in the U.S., Canada, U.K., and Australia to gain a broader education.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} English is the only common language spoken at universities in these countries, with the most significant exception being Francophone universities in Canada. International students not only need to acquire good communication skills and fluent English both in writing and speaking, but also absorb the Western academic writing culture in style, structure, reference, and the local policy toward academic integrity in academic writing.&lt;ref name="ireland"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Ireland, Christopher and English, John|year=2011|title=Let Them Plagiarise: Developing Academic Writing in a Safe Environment|journal=Journal of Academic Writing|volume=1|issue=1|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264452242_Let_Them_Plagiarise_Developing_Academic_Writing_in_a_Safe_Environment|pages=165–172|doi= 10.18552/joaw.v1i1.10}}&lt;/ref&gt; International students may have difficulty completing satisfactory assignments because of the difficulty with grammar and spelling, differences in culture, or a lack of confidence in English academic writing. Insightful opinions may lose the original meaning when transformed from the student's native language to English. Even if international students acquire good scores in English proficiency exams or are able to communicate with native British students frequently in class, they often find that the wording and formatting of academic papers in English-speaking universities are different from what they are used to due to certain cultural abstraction. Students who experience this discrepancy get lower scores of adaptability to new environment and higher scores about anxiety. Instead of the mood, students who were further away from home would be more willing to go back home and regress from their aims in life, this hardship can lead to depression. Partly this is due to the academic contagions of the foreign university like not integrating [[contrastive rhetoric]] aspect, low-support for adaptation like providing opportunities to better their English in a non-competitive and meaningful way. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://help.cucas.edu.cn/index/detail?id=2842 |title=Top Chinese Universities in Medicine |publisher=CUCAS |date=2010-05-28 |accessdate=2014-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most foreign students encounter difficulties in language use. Such issues make it difficult for the student to make domestic friends and gain familiarity with the local culture. Sometimes, these language barriers can subject international students to ignorance or disrespect from native speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Lindemann, "Listening with an attitude: A model of native speaker comprehension of non-native speakers in the United States" Language in Society 31. (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Most international students are also lacking a support groups in the country they are studying. Although all the colleges in North America, that are in a student exchange programs, do have International Student Office, it sometimes does not have resources and capability to consider their students' individual needs when it comes to adapting the new environment. The more a particular college has students coming from the same country the better the support is for getting involved to the new culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beck|first1=Richard|last2=Taylor|first2=Cathy|last3=Robbins|first3=Marla|title=Missing home: Sociotropy and autonomy and their relationship to psychological distress and homesickness in college freshmen|journal=Anxiety, Stress &amp; Coping|date=June 2003|volume=16|issue=2|pages=155–166|doi=10.1080/10615806.2003.10382970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign students have several challenges in their academic studies at North American universities. Studies have shown that these challenges include several different factors: inadequate English proficiency; unfamiliarity with North American culture; lack of appropriate study skills or strategies; academic learning anxiety; low social self-efficacy; financial difficulties; and separation from family and friends.&lt;ref&gt;Jinyan Huang&amp; Kathleen Brown "cultural factors affecting Chinese ESL students’ academic learning" Education. (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the general perception that American culture is characterized more by diversity than by homogeneity, the American ideology of cultural homogeneity implies an American mindset that because Eurocentric cultures are superior to others, people with different cultures should conform to the dominant monocultural canon and norms.&lt;ref&gt;Hsieh, Min-Hua. "Challenges For International Students In Higher Education: One Student's Narrated Story Of Invisibility And Struggle." College Student Journal 41.2 (2007): 379-391.Academic Search Premier. Web. 16 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. colleges and universities have long welcomed students from China, where their higher-education system cannot meet the demand. Three years ago, a record 10 million students throughout China took the national college entrance test, competing for 5.7 million university slots. Because foreign undergraduates typically fail to qualify for U.S. federal aid, colleges here can provide limited financial help. Now, thanks to China's booming economy in recent years, more Chinese families can afford to pay.
U.S. colleges also face challenges abroad. Worries about fraud on test scores and transcripts make occasional headlines. And even Chinese students who test high on an English-language proficiency test may not be able to speak or write well enough to stay up to speed in a U.S. classroom, where essay writing and discussions are common.&lt;ref name="Number of Chinese students applying for a US Visa increases"&gt;[http://www.visabureau.com/america/news/16-11-2010/number-of-chinese-students-applying-for-a-us-visa-increases.aspx "Number of Chinese students applying for a US Visa increases"], ''USA Visa Bureau,'' November 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese international students face other challenges besides language proficiency. The Chinese educational structure focuses on exam-oriented education, with educational thinking and activities aimed towards meeting the [[entrance examination]]. Students stress more on exam performance, and teachers are inclined to focus on lecturing to teach students what may be on the test. In addition, "parents are also convinced that the more students listened to the lectures, the better they would score on the finals."&lt;ref name="A First-Person Explanation of Why Some International Students Are Silent in the U.S. Classroom"&gt;Bista,Krishna, [http://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/learning-styles/a-first-person-explanation-of-why-some-international-students-are-silent-in-the-u-s-classroom/ "A First-Person Explanation of Why Some International Students Are Silent in the U.S. Classroom"], "Faculty Focus", June 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  With more than 304,040 Chinese students enrolled in the US in 2014/15, China is by far the leading source of international students at American universities and colleges, however, there are [https://resources.interedge.org/2016/04/20/three-waves/ three waves of growth in Chinese students in the US]. Each of the three waves differs in terms of needs and expectations and corresponding support services needed.

International students also face cross-cultural barriers that hinder their ability to succeed in a new environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://resources.interedge.org/category/intercultural-competence/|title=Intercultural Competence – International Student Success Training and Resources|website=resources.interedge.org|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there are differences in terms of receiving and giving feedback which influences the academic engagement and even job and internship search approach of international students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://resources.interedge.org/2016/04/10/cross-cultural-map-feedback/|title=Navigate the Cross-cultural Map: Feedback|last=Hu|first=Di|date=2016-04-10|website=International Student Success Training and Resources|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plagiarism is the most serious offense in academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Problems with Plagiarism|url=http://www.mcny.edu/student_serv/lecblog/the-problems-with-plagiarism|accessdate=June 16, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920175418/http://www.mcny.edu/student_serv/lecblog/the-problems-with-plagiarism|archivedate=September 20, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plagiarism has two subtle forms, one of which includes the omission of elements required for proper citations and references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Recognize Plagiarism: Tutorials and Tests|url=https://www.indiana.edu/~academy/firstPrinciples/certificationTests/index.html|accessdate=June 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second form is unacknowledged use or incorporation of another person's work or achievement.  Violation of either form can result in a student's expulsion. For the international students the word plagiarism is a foreign word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=For some international students, 'plagiarism' is a foreign word.|url=http://www.mprnews.org/story/2014/10/08/international-students-cheating|accessdate=June 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of them are unfamiliar with American academic standards and colleges aren’t good about giving a clear definition of the word's meaning. For example, many international students don’t know using even one sentence of someone else's work can be considered plagiarism. Most colleges give students an E on their plagiarized assignments and future offenses often result in failing class or being kicked out of university.

International students studying in a foreign country face a life altering event which can cause distress that can potentially affect their mental wellness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Enhancing Social Support, Hardiness, and Acculturation to Improve Mental Health among Asian Indian International Students|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2190/IQ.30.1.e|journal=International Quarterly of Community Health Education|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many students report homesickness and loneliness in their initial transition, experience isolation from peers and struggle with understanding cultural differences while staying abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kanekar|first=Amar|last2=Sharma|first2=Manoj|last3=Atri|first3=Ashutosh|title=Enhancing Social Support, Hardiness, and Acculturation to Improve Mental Health among Asian Indian International Students|url=https://doi.org/10.2190/IQ.30.1.e|journal=International Quarterly of Community Health Education|volume=30|issue=1|pages=55–68|doi=10.2190/iq.30.1.e}}&lt;/ref&gt; In certain cultures, mental illness is seen as a sign of weakness. Because of this, international students believe they can prevail through their struggles alone without help, which can lead to,  a decrease in mental wellness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Enhancing Social Support, Hardiness, and Acculturation to Improve Mental Health among Asian Indian International Students|url=https://doi.org/10.2190/IQ.30.1.e|journal=International Quarterly of Community Health Education|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common symptoms among international students from China in particular noted that two prevailing symptoms were discovered: 45 percent of the students faced depression and 29 percent of the students faced anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://worldwidescience.org/topicpages/h/higher+internalizing+symptoms.html|title=higher internalizing symptoms: Topics by WorldWideScience.org|website=worldwidescience.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stressors that lead international students to struggle with anxiety are rooted in numerous causes, including academic pressures, financial issues, adapting to a new culture, creating friendships, and feelings of loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://campusmentalhealth.ca/literature/international-student-mental-health/|title=International Student Mental Health - Centre for Innovation in Campus Mental Health|last=Health|first=Centre for Innovation in Campus Mental|work=Centre for Innovation in Campus Mental Health|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; International students are also more likely to rely on peers for support through their transition than teachers or adult peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hyun|first=Jenny|last2=Quinn|first2=Brian|last3=Madon|first3=Temina|last4=Lustig|first4=Steve|date=September 2007|title=Mental health need, awareness, and use of counseling services among international graduate students|journal=Journal of American college health: J of ACH|volume=56|issue=2|pages=109–118|doi=10.3200/JACH.56.2.109-118|issn=0744-8481|pmid=17967756}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the student is unable to make friends in their new environment, they will struggle more with their transition than an international student who has established relationships with their peers.&lt;ref name="psycnet.apa.org"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Moderating effects of perceived language discrimination on mental health outcomes among Chinese international students.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-14250-001|journal=Asian American Journal of Psychology|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International students also face language discrimination, which may exacerbate mental health symptoms.&lt;ref name="psycnet.apa.org"/&gt; Evidence has not conclusively shown that language discrimination is a greater risk factor than discrimination against foreigners.&lt;ref name="psycnet.apa.org"/&gt; However, there has not been any conclusive evidence to show whether language discrimination plays a significantly larger role than simple foreigner discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wei|first=Meifen|last2=Liang|first2=Ya-Shu|last3=Du|first3=Yi|last4=Botello|first4=Raquel|last5=Li|first5=Chun-I|title=Moderating effects of perceived language discrimination on mental health outcomes among Chinese international students.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/aap0000021|journal=Asian American Journal of Psychology|volume=6|issue=3|pages=213–222|doi=10.1037/aap0000021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Study abroad==
Studying abroad is the act of a student pursuing educational opportunities in a country other than one's own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=BBC News| title = Students Should Study Abroad|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/720344.stm| date = 20 April 2000| accessdate=2010-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can include primary, secondary and post-secondary students. A 2012 study showed number of students studying abroad represents about 9.4% of all students enrolled at institutions of higher education in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| publisher=NAFSA: Association of International Educators| title=Trends in U.S. Study Abroad| url=http://www.nafsa.org/public_policy.sec/study_abroad_2/demographics_of_study/| accessdate=18 December 2010| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219190829/http://www.nafsa.org/public_policy.sec/study_abroad_2/demographics_of_study/| archive-date=19 December 2010| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Education Statistics.

Studying abroad is a valuable program for international students as it is intended to increase the students' knowledge and understanding of other cultures. International education not only helps students with their language and communicating skills, but also encourages students to develop a different perspective and cross cultural understanding of their studies which will further their education and benefit them in their career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sowa|first=Patience A.|date=2002-03-01|title=How valuable are student exchange programs?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/he.49/abstract|journal=New Directions for Higher Education|language=en|volume=2002|issue=117|pages=63–70|doi=10.1002/he.49|issn=1536-0741}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/f4e4f0bb001fc0eee5905fb2ea84a055/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=26636|title=Translating Study Abroad Experiences for Workplace Competencies - ProQuest|website=search.proquest.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Main factors that determine the outcome quality of international studies are transaction dynamics (between the environmental conditions and the international student), quality of environment, and the student's [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] behavior.

=== Distinctions in Classroom culture ===
Certain distinctions and differences can become sources of cultural shock and cultural misunderstandings that can lead a student to inhibit adaptation and adjustment. For example, a key requirement in many foreign institutions is participation. Failure to participate in the classroom with faculty can be a serious obstacle to academic success and if it is coupled with the view that professors are to be held in awe, then the problem can be reflected in the grades given for class participation. Lack of participation can be interpreted by faculty as failure to learn the course content or disinterest in the topic.

Some of the identified distinctions are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| publisher=NAFSA: Association of International Educators| title=Classroom Culture's in Abroad| url=http://www.nafsa.org/| accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Semester system has three models, they are (1) the semester system comprising two terms, one in fall and one in winter/spring (summer term is not required); (2) the trimester system comprising three terms that includes summer (one of these terms can be a term of vacation); and (3) the quarter system comprising the four terms of fall, winter, spring, and summer, and in which the student can choose one of them to take as a vacation.
* The schedule of the classes is a standard five-day week for classes, but the instruction hours in a week may be divided into a variety of models. Two common models of choice are Monday/Wednesday/Friday (MWF) and Tuesday/Thursday (TT) model. As a result, the class hours per week are the same, but the length of time per class for the MWF will be different from the TT.
* Most foreign institutes values ideologies of fairness and independence. This standards ensure the rights and responsibilities of all students, regardless of background. Most institutions that define the rights and responsibilities of their students also provide a code of conduct to guide their behavior. Because independence and freedom comes with responsibilities.
* Certain immigration regulations allow international students to gain practical experience during their studies through employment in their field of study like an internship during your study, and at other times for one year of employment after you complete your studies. The eligibility factors are often disseminated through international students office at the college or university.
* Faculty differ both in rank and by the duration of their contracts. They are (1) Distinguished teaching and research faculty hold the most honored rank among faculty. They typically have the doctoral degree and are usually tenured (i.e. on a permanent contract with the school until they retire) and record of their personal excellence accounts for their standing; (2) Emeritus professors are honored faculty who have retired from the university but continue to teach or undertake research at colleges and universities; (3) Full professors are also tenured and hold the doctoral degree. It is length of service and the support of departmental chairpersons, colleagues, and administrators that leads to the promotion to this rank; (4) Associate professors typically hold the doctoral degree and are the most recent to receive tenure; (5) Assistant professors may or may not yet have their doctoral degrees and have held their teaching or research posts for less than seven years; (6) Instructors are usually the newest faculty. They may or may not hold the doctoral degree and are working towards tenure; (7) Adjunct professors and visiting professors may hold professorial rank at another institution. They are not tenured (usually retained on a year by year contract) and they are often honored members of the university community.
* Most institutes that accept international students have faculty who are leaders that can integrate best elements of teacher centered and [[Student-centred learning|learner centered]] pedagogical styles that integrates and leads students of every diversity to a path of success. They are careful not to obstruct a student with their own personality or achievements and maintain a resourceful, open and supportive "holding environment". Simplified, meaningful resource dissemination and engaging students in participatory and active learning is the key to this mixed learning. Lack of skill in handling such pedagogical methods might result in straining the students (taking classes in a faster pace disregarding the quality and quantity of the information transferred, which translates as lack of internal agency to make students learning meaningful by being an educational agent - lack of teacher agency&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mark Priestley|author2=Gert Biesta|author3=Sarah Robinson|title=Teacher Agency: An Ecological Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=09hbCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28|date=22 October 2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4725-2587-1|pages=28+}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and at other instances downgrade into a liberal [[laissez-faire]] style which might affect negatively on students performance. The skill of the tutor is exemplified in many forms one such is when they are able to keep some students from dominating (attention seeking, disruptive or disrespectful) and to draw in those who are reticent in a participatory section.
* Students are expected to know the content of their courses from the class website (structure of the course, frame of references, jargon's) and to think independently about it and to express their own perspectives and opinions in class and in their written work. Open disagreement is a sign of violent intentions in certain cultures and in other cultures it is merely expressing one’s opinion, this aspect can be challenging if proper [[people skills]] is absent in the group and [[group development]] isn't given importance. Similar is the case with asking questions, in certain classroom cultures it is tolerated asking vague questions and this is interpreted as a sign of interest from the student whereas in other cultures asking vague questions is a display of ignorance in public that results in loss of face and embarrassment, even if this behavior is counterproductive for a learning environment, it is largely dependent upon the transaction dynamics in classroom cultures. There are also certain institutes and cultures that disallow student discussion at certain topics and keep limitations to what can be discussed and punitive means for deterring from topics that shouldn't be discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/what-genocide-california-university-grapples-clash-between-native-american-student-2085889|title=What Is Genocide? California University Grapples With Clash Between Native-American Student, History Professor Over This Question|date=7 September 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But often direct communication is considered vital for academic survival.
* Foreign university programs differ from structured programs of universities in certain countries. In each quarter the student is given choice to select the courses they deem important to them for gaining credits. There is no proportion for no. of courses that a student can take in each term, however program fees paid at a single time can lead to fees deduction in each quarter. In general, students are not recommended to take many courses at a time as they require to gain certain no. of credits to pass a quarter which is dependent upon the grades that they obtain from the courses, and this credits have little to do with the actual credit hours spent for each courses. For the courses students have to pre-register as they are not automatically assigned. Though its an open structure for course selections, students might require to take certain compulsory courses for the program as maintained by departments for degree standardization.
* Foreign institutions differ in their requirement of the content that a student require to be familiarized with and this difference is identifiable in programs which have similar objectives and structure that of different universities. Some may be professional oriented and thus give importance to depth in certain areas and some might be for providing a breadth of knowledge on the subject. Commonly, some institutes might require to master the essentials of a subject as a whole while others might require to master large quantities of content on the subject which might not seem practical in a framework of short period of time (An example is [[Outliers (book)|10,000-Hour Rule]]).&lt;ref&gt;Esterman, M., Noonan, S. K., Rosenberg, M., &amp; DeGutis, J. (2012). In the zone or zoning out? Tracking behavioral and neural fluctuations during sustained attention. Cerebral Cortex, 23(11), 2712-2723.&lt;/ref&gt; More accessible institutions provide syllabus of their previous and current programs and courses for better pre- and post- program communication.
* Classroom etiquette may differ from institute to institute. In western institutes the old standard of practice for students to address faculty is by their last name and the title "Professor", but it is not uncommon for faculty to be on a first-name basis with students today. However it is a good etiquette to check with the faculty member before addressing him or her by their first name only. Both students and faculty often dress very informally, and it is not unusual for faculty to roam the classroom while talking or to sit on the edge of a table in a very relaxed posture. Relaxed dress and posture are not, however, signs of relaxed standards of performance. Sometimes faculty, administrators, and even staff may sometimes hold receptions or dinners for their students. In that case, students should ask what the dress should be for the occasion; sometimes students will be expected to wear professional dress (suit coat and tie for men, and a suit or more formal dresses for women). Faculty wouldn't be caring even if they elicit the need of participation in classroom or as personally involved with students even if they engage students in frameworks/styles the student might understand the topic. This is because the faculty-student relationship is considered to be professional. Relationships in the West are most often determined by some kind of function. Here the function is guidance, education and skill development.
* In occidental institutions students are evaluated in many ways, including exams, papers, lab reports, simulation results, oral presentations, attendance and participation in classroom discussion. The instructors use a variety of types of exams, including multiple choice, short answer, and essay. Most adept instructor's provide guides or models of assignment construction, framing and on asking questions and how to prepare for their exams. Most students are expected to be creative in presentation (to avoid similarity in paper submissions), systematic in formatting (citation: [[Style guide]]) and invested for drawing and providing positive individualism to the group/class (group purpose, role identity for autonomy, positive thinking, value oriented responsible self-expression, etc. vs. attendant selfishness, alienation, divisiveness, etc.) aligned with the common development objective.
* Relationships are an important part of the foreign academic experience and for healthy social support. Relationships with faculty (instructors and academic advisor's) are very important for academic success and for bridging cultural gap. But in off campus venues, appreciate their life outside of campus and every time you view one another as individuals, avoid asking favors that can affect teacher student comfort zones and expect cautiousness from them in an attempt to avoid notions of favoritism and friendliness to break down barriers of role and culture.

A key factor in international academic success is learning approaches that can be taken on a matter from one another and simultaneously assimilating inter-cultural experiences.

=== Titles and roles in Administrative structure ===
* The vice-chancellor or vice-president for academic affairs manages the various schools and departments.
* The council of deans oversees the separate schools, institutes, and programs offered by the university or college.
* The departmental chairperson manages the affairs of the separate departments in each school or college.
* Faculty is responsible for teaching and research in and beyond the classroom.
* Secretaries and technical support staff in foreign countries have much authority than their counterparts in certain countries. They are treated respectfully by faculty and students alike.

=== Accommodation ===

Accommodation is a major factor that determines study abroad experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr. T.P. Sethumadhavan|title=Study Abroad|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TeyvDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA129|year=2014|publisher=DC Books|isbn=978-81-264-4803-6|pages=129–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anna Lidstone|author2=Caroline Rueckert|title=The Study Abroad Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D_EcBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145|year=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-02056-7|pages=145–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Host family ====
A host family volunteers to house a student during their program. The family receives payment for hosting. Students are responsible for their own spending, including school fees, uniform, text books, internet, and phone calls. Host families could be family units with or without children or retired couples; most programs require one host to be at least 25 years of age. The host families are well prepared to experience a new culture and give a new cultural experience to the student. A student could live with more than one family during their international study program to expand their knowledge and experience more of the new culture. Host families are responsible for providing a room, meals, and a stable family environment for the student. Most international student advisory's allow for a switch of hosts if problems arise.

==== Housing ====
An international student involved in study abroad program can choose to live  [[on-campus housing|on campus]] or off campus. Living off campus is a popular choice, because students are more independent and learn more about the new culture when they are on their own. Universities that host international students will offer assistance in obtaining accommodation. Universities in Asia have on-campus housing for international students on exchange or studying full-time. Temporary options include hostels, hotels, or renting. [[Homestay]]s, paid accommodation with a host family, are available in some countries.

=== Coping in Study abroad ===

==== The w-curve adjustment model ====

The w-curve model created by Gullahorn and Gullahorn (1963) is W shaped model that attempts to give a visual description of a travelers possible experience of culture shock when entering a new culture and the re-entry shock experienced when returning home. The model has seven stages.

#Honeymoon Stage
#Hostility Stage
#Humorous/Rebounding Stage
#In-Sync Stage
#Ambivalence Stage
#Re-Entry Culture Shock Stage
#Re-Socialization Stage

Each stage of the model aims to prepare travellers for the rollercoaster of emotions that they may experience both while returning and traveling from a trip abroad. The hope in the creation of this model is to help prepare travelers for the negative feelings often associated with living in another culture. By doing so, it is the goal that these emotions will be better dealt with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/|title=Homepage - Wiley|website=www.wiley.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Positive affectivity ====

Affectivity is an emotional disposition, people who are high on positive affectivity experience positive emotions and moods like joy and excitement, and view the world, including themselves and other people, in a positive light. They tend to be cheerful, enthusiastic, lively, sociable, and energetic. Research has found that student's studying  abroad with a positive emotional tendency have higher satisfaction and interaction with the environment, they engage in the staying country's citizenship behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Velliaris, Donna M.|author2=Coleman-George, Deb|title=Handbook of Research on Study Abroad Programs and Outbound Mobility|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CoPvDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA724|date=24 August 2016|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-5225-0170-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, J.

==Education==

===High school===
In the United States, the [[Education in the United States#School grades|11th grade]] is usually the third year of a student's high school period and is referred to as junior year.

===College===
In the U.S., colleges generally require students to declare an [[academic major]] by the beginning of their junior year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.princetonreview.com/college/research/articles/majors/MajorsBook3.asp
|title=Do I Need to Declare a Major on My College Application?
|publisher=[[Princeton Review]]
|accessdate=2007-10-22}}
&lt;/ref&gt; College juniors are advised to begin the [[internship]] process and preparing for additional education (medical school, law school, etc.) by completing applications and taking additional examinations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/visvi/students/year_guide/junior.html Yale UCS - Year by Year Guide - Sophomore Year&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060916102757/http://www.yale.edu/visvi/students/year_guide/junior.html |date=2006-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom primary school===
In the UK, any child in key stage 2 (Year 3 – Year 6) is known as a junior, having developed from previously being infants. At the end of Year 6 (usually age 11), they leave primary school and go to secondary school&amp;nbsp;— the transition from Junior to Senior (unless they live in an area with a middle school system).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8907">'''Learning standards''' (also called '''academic standards''', '''content standards''' and '''curricula''') are elements of declarative, procedural, schematic, and strategic knowledge that, as a body, define the specific content of an educational program.  Standards are usually composed of statements that express what a student knows, can do, or is capable of performing at a certain point in their '''learning progression''' (often designated by "grade" or its equivalent).

Learning standards have multiple uses in a modern education ecosystem. They can be links to content,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Browder|first1=Diane|last2=Spooner|first2=Fred|last3=Wakeman|first3=Shawnee|title=Aligning Instruction with Academic Content Standards: Finding the Link|journal=Research and Practice for Persons with Severe Disabilities|date=1 December 2006|volume=31|issue=4|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/154079690603100404?journalCode=rpsd|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they can be part of a learning pathway or progression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Learning Pathway|url=http://edglossary.org/learning-pathway/|website=Glossary of Education Reform|publisher=Great Schools Partnership|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History in the United States==

In the United States, textbooks such as [[Noah Webster|Noah Webster's]] [[History of education in the United States|Speller]] promulgated specific knowledge to be taught to people at specific ages. Chicago superintendent William Harvey Wells expanded this approach by creating a course of instruction for Chicago Public Schools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kliebard|first=Herbert M.|title=Education at the Turn of the Century: A Crucible of Curriculum Change|journal=Educational Researcher|year=1982|volume=11|issue=1|pages=16–24|doi=10.3102/0013189x011001016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he codified in "A Graded Course of Instruction for Public Schools".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wells|first=William Harvey|title=The Graded School: A Graded Course of Instruction for Public Schools|year=1862|publisher=G. Sherwood|location=Chicago|url=https://archive.org/details/gradedschoolagr01wellgoog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the first learning standards originated as a result of content in textbooks, rather than through a systematic, democratic approach. In 1892, the [[National Education Association]] convened the [[Committee of Ten]], which codified the first learning standards designed for a national high school audience. One year later, in 1893, the Committee of Fifteen on Elementary Education was formed to determine a standard number of years for elementary education, establish the content and sequence for elementary grades, and explicate a standardized course of training for elementary school teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Button|first=Henry Warren|title=Committee of Fifteen|journal=History of Education Quarterly|date=December 1965|volume=5|issue=4|pages=253–263|doi=10.2307/367584|jstor=367584}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Committee of Fifteen on Elementary Education, [[National Education Association]] of the United States|date=1895|title=Report of the Committee of Fifteen on elementary education: With the reports of the sub-committees; on the training of teachers; on the correlation of studies in elementary education; on the organization of city school systems|publisher=Pub. for the National Educational Association by the American Book Company|edition=1|oclc=2304784|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pM6gAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Committee of Fifteen's work focused primarily on defining the timing, content and teacher training for urban schools. As a result, the National Education Agency further formed the Committee of Twelve on the Rural School Problem and, in 1897, released a report intended to bring about the "...widespread consolidation of American rural schools, [to mirror] the conglomerating urban areas of the country...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feldmann|first=Doug|title=Twenty-Five Years of Erosion in the Curriculum: The Committee of Ten to the Cardinal Principles, 1893-1918|journal=Research for Education Reform|year=2005|volume=10|issue=2|pages=41–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the 20th century, the Core Knowledge Sequence developed by [[E.D. Hirsch|E. D. Hirsch]] may have contributed to cultural values espoused as learning standards and guides. The Knowledge Sequence provides a sequence for "... specific content (and skills) [to be] taught in English/language arts, history, geography, mathematics, science, and the fine arts"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the Core Knowledge Sequence|url=http://www.coreknowledge.org/download-the-sequence|work=Core Knowledge Foundation|publisher=Core Knowledge Foundation|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and had been adopted by some large school districts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldman|first=S. R.|title=Designing for Scaleable Educational Improvement: Processes of Inquiry in Practice|journal=In Scaling Up for Success: Lessons Learned from technology-based educational improvement, ed. C. Dede, J.P Honan, L.C. Peters|pages=67–96|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco, C.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, learning standards have become an important part of the [[standards-based education reform|standards-based education reform movement]], in which learning standards are tied directly to [[Rubric (academic)|rubrics]] and [[Standards-based assessment|assessments]] in many schools; [[List of standardized tests in the United States|standardized tests]] are often used for grade-level evaluations within districts and states, and across states; [[High school graduation examination in the United States|standardized exams]] are used to graduate students in many US schools.

==Usage in other nations==

* In [[Germany]] the [[Kultusministerkonferenz]] (conference of ministers of education) defines, publishes and evaluates standards for different school graduation forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Qualitätssicherung in Schulen|url=http://www.kmk.org/dokumentation/veroeffentlichungen-beschluesse/bildung-schule/qualitaetssicherung-in-schulen.html#c7035|publisher=KMK|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Japan|Japan's]] Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture of Japan manages National Curriculum Standards. These standards define the content for classes in Mathematics, Science, Japanese language, Social Studies, Life Environment Studies, Music, Drawing and Handicraft, Physical Education and Homemaking at the Kindergarten, Elementary, Lower and Upper Secondary levels.
* [[Singapore]] utilizes syllabi to "[describe] the primary content expectations for each level through topic lists, which are similar to standards. Details are differentiated for students in different streams, or academic tracks. All students will study content through what is called the O-Level".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comparing the Common Core State Standards and  Singapore’s Mathematics Syllabus|url=http://www.achieve.org/files/CCSSandSingapore.pdf|publisher=Achieve, Inc|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

An example of learning standards are state-developed learning standards as described below or the [[Common Core State Standards]] (CCSS) developed by the [[National Governors Association|NGA]] and the [[Council of Chief State School Officers| Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO)]].

State learning standards are developed by [[board of education|state boards of education]] and enforced by [[State education agency|state education agencies]] across the US.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teach-nology.com/teachers/standards/ Aggregator Site for Standards]&lt;/ref&gt;

Learning standards are also present at the local level in curriculum published by [[school district]]s where they often take the form of guidelines by grade of what a student can or should be able to do, or possibly even activity level learning objectives. These often are based on the state standards but at a finer grain.

Learning standards can also take the form of [[learning objective]]s and content-specific standards and [[controlled vocabulary]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegateway.org/asn GEM]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[metadata]] about content.&lt;ref&gt;[[Learning object metadata|LOM]]&lt;/ref&gt; There are technical standards for encoding these standards that deal with K-12 learning environments,&lt;ref&gt;[[Schools Interoperability Framework|The SIF standard]]&lt;/ref&gt; which are separate from those in [[higher education]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imsglobal.org/competencies/index.html Higher Ed Competency standards]&lt;/ref&gt; and private business.&lt;ref&gt;[[SCORM| SCORM - Shared Content Object Reference Model]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Man: A Course of Study''', usually known by the acronym '''MACOS''' or '''M.A.C.O.S.''', was an [[United States|American]] [[humanities]] teaching program, popular in America and Britain in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfb.ca/collection/films/fiche/?id=51241|title=Through These Eyes|publisher=National Film Board of Canada|access-date=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was based on the theories of [[Jerome Bruner]], particularly his concept of the "[[spiral curriculum]]". This suggested that a concept might be taught repeatedly within a [[curriculum]], but at a number of levels, each level being more complex than the first. The process of repetition would thus enable the child to absorb more complex ideas easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/jerome-s-bruner-influential-psychologist-of-perception-dies-at-100/2016/06/07/033e5870-2cc3-11e6-9b37-42985f6a265c_story.html|title=Jerome S. Bruner, Influential Psychologist of Perception, Dies at 100|publisher=The Washington Post|first=Matt|last=Schudel|date=June 7, 2016|access-date=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infed.org/mobi/jerome-bruner-and-the-process-of-education/|title=Jerome Bruner and the Process of Education|publisher=Infed|first=Mark|last=Smith|date=2002|access-date=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In MACOS, the concept was "the chain of [[life]]" or a "lifeline": the entire history of a living thing. The course started with a simple lifespan in the form of the Pacific Coast [[salmon]]. It then moved on to the more complex life form of the [[herring gull]], introducing concepts such as nurturing. The lifespan of the [[baboon]] was next examined, particularly within the societal context afforded by the [[baboon#Society|baboon troop]]. The differences between [[innate behaviour]] and [[learning|learned]] behaviour were introduced. Finally, the study opened up into a study of a man's lifespan with a case study of [[Netsilik Inuit]]. This also included the interaction between the Netsilik and other life forms, such as [[reindeer]] and [[pinniped|seals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/04/25/archives/the-proper-study-of-mankind-.html|title=The Proper Study of Mankind|publisher=The New York Times|first=Lee|last=Dembart|date=April 25, 1976|access-date=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The course comprised a self-contained kit of course materials, film cassettes, visual aids, and games. Some of the activities were very imaginative; a game based upon reindeer [[wikt:migration|migration]] had a loaded [[dice|die]] to introduce discussion about instincts, and a paper seal would be cut up and shared among class members representing various people in the [[Netsilik]] community, according to a ritual governing who was entitled to which part of the animal.

The emphasis of the course was upon learning particular skills within the teaching process, not upon the significance of the content. This included the necessity to ask questions, discuss, and reach conclusions based on evidence and argument.

The course was much criticized in the United States because of its emphasis upon questioning aspects of life, including belief and morality. It was particularly targeted by [[fundamentalist]] groups, evidenced by quotations included in the course booklet. In 2004, the [[National Film Board of Canada]] produced  ''Through These Eyes'', a documentary about the controversy surrounding MACOS, and more generally about the interplay between politics and education.&lt;ref&gt;Kincheloe,  Joe L. &amp;  Horn, Raymond A.(Eds).

[[File:Cover of McGuffey's First Eclectic Reader.jpeg|thumb|upright|Cover of ''McGuffey's First Reader'']]

'''McGuffey Readers''' were a series of [[graded reader|graded]] [[primer (textbook)|primer]]s for grade levels 1-6. They were widely used as [[textbooks]] in American schools from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century, and are still used today in some [[private school]]s and in [[homeschooling]].

It is estimated that at least 120 million copies of McGuffey's Readers were sold between 1836 and 1960, placing its sales in a category with the [[Bible]] and ''[[Webster's Dictionary]]''.&lt;ref name="nps"&gt;{{cite news|authors=The [[National Park Service]] and the [[United States Department of Interior]]|url=http://www.nps.gov/jeff/historyculture/upload/mcguffey.pdf |title=William Holmes McGuffey and His Readers|work=The Museum Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1961, they have continued to sell at a rate of some 30,000 copies a year.&lt;ref name="nps"/&gt; Only the ''Ray's Arithmetic'' series (1834-1913) matched it in popularity, written by a colleague of McGuffey's and begun in 1834.&lt;ref name="nps"/&gt;
==McGuffey==

The editor of the Readers was [[William Holmes McGuffey]]. He was born September 23, 1800 near [[Claysville, Pennsylvania]] and moved to [[Youngstown, Ohio]] with his parents in 1802. McGuffey's family had emigrated to America from [[Scotland]] in 1774, and they had strong opinions on religion and a belief in education. Consequently, education and preaching the Gospel were McGuffey's passions. He had a remarkable ability to memorize and could commit to memory entire books of the [[Bible]]. 

McGuffey became a "roving" teacher at the age of 14, beginning with 48 students in a one-room school in [[Calcutta, Ohio]] and at a seminary in the town of [[Poland, Ohio]]. The size of the class was just one of several challenges which the young McGuffey faced. In many one-teacher schools, students' ages varied from six to 21. McGuffey often worked 11 hours a day, six days a week, in a succession of frontier schools, primarily in the state of [[Kentucky]]. Students brought their own books, most frequently the Bible, since few textbooks existed.

Between teaching jobs, McGuffey received a classical education at the [[Greersburg Academy]] (also called The Old Stone Academy) in [[Darlington, Pennsylvania]].  He went on to study at Washington College (now [[Washington &amp; Jefferson College]]) where he graduated in 1826. That same year, he was appointed to a position as Professor of Languages at [[Miami University]] in [[Oxford, Ohio]].

McGuffey became famous as the author of the Readers (more accurately the editor), but he wrote few other works. He left Miami University for positions of successively greater responsibility at [[Cincinnati College]], [[Ohio University]] in [[Athens, Ohio]], and [[Woodward High School (Cincinnati, Ohio)|Woodward College]] in Cincinnati, where he served as president. He ended his career as a Professor of Moral Philosophy at the [[University of Virginia]].

===Personal life===
In 1827, McGuffey married Harriet Spinning, and the couple eventually had five children. He was known for his [[philanthropy]] and generosity among the poor and newly emancipated [[African American]]s through the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and following years. He died in 1873.

==Publication==
McGuffey established a reputation as a lecturer on moral and biblical subjects while he was teaching at [[Miami University]]. In 1835, the small [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] publishing firm of Truman and Smith asked him to create a series of four graded readers for primary level students. He had been recommended for the job by longtime friend [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]. He completed the first two readers within a year of signing his contract, receiving a fee of $1,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000|1836|r=-4}}}} in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}} dollars). He compiled the first four readers (1836-1837 edition), while the fifth and sixth were created by his brother Alexander during the 1840s. The series consisted of stories, poems, essays, and speeches. The advanced Readers contained excerpts from the works of well-regarded English and American writers and politicians such as [[Lord Byron]], [[John Milton]], and [[Daniel Webster]].

Most schools of the 19th century used only the first two in the series of McGuffey's four readers. The first Reader taught reading by using the [[phonics]] method, the identification of letters and their arrangement into words, and aided with [[Writing slate|slate]] work. The second Reader was used once students could read.  It helped them to understand the meaning of sentences, while providing vivid stories which children could remember. The third Reader taught the definitions of words and was written at a level equivalent to the modern 5th or 6th grade. The fourth Reader was written for the highest levels of ability on the grammar school level.

McGuffey's Readers were among the first textbooks in the United States designed to be increasingly challenging with each volume. They used word repetition in the text as a learning tool, developing reading skills by challenging students using the books. Sounding-out, enunciation, and accents were emphasized. Colonial-era texts had offered dull lists of 20 to 100 new words per page for memorization. In contrast, McGuffey used new vocabulary words in the context of real literature, gradually introducing new words and carefully repeating the old.

McGuffey believed that teachers, as well as their students, should study the lessons and suggested that they read aloud to their classes. He also listed questions after each story, for he believed that asking questions was critical for a teacher to give instruction.  The Readers emphasized spelling, vocabulary, and formal public speaking, which was a more common requirement in 19th-century America than today.

McGuffey is remembered as a conservative theological teacher. He interpreted the goals of public schooling in terms of moral and spiritual education, and attempted to give schools a curriculum that would instill [[Presbyterian]] [[Calvinist]] beliefs and manners in their students. These goals were considered suitable for the relatively homogeneous America of the early- to mid-19th century, though they were less so for the increasingly pluralistic society that developed in the late 19th century and early 20th century. 

The content of the readers changed drastically between McGuffey's 1836-1837 edition and the 1879 edition. The revised Readers were compiled to meet the needs of national unity and the dream of an American [[melting pot]] for the world's oppressed masses. The [[Calvinist]] values of salvation, righteousness, and piety were excluded from the later versions, though they had been prominent in the early Readers. The content of the books was secularized and replaced by middle-class [[civil religion]], morality, and values. McGuffey's name was featured on these revised editions, yet he neither contributed to them nor approved their content.

Other types of schoolbooks gradually replaced McGuffey's in the academic marketplace. The desire for distinct grade levels and less overtly religious content, and the greater profitability of consumable workbooks all helped to bring about their decline. McGuffey's Readers never entirely disappeared, however.  Reprinted versions of his Readers are still in print, and may be purchased in bookstores across the country. Today, McGuffey's Readers are popular among homeschoolers and in some Protestant religious schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Smith, S.J. |url=http://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1118&amp;context=educ_fac_pubs&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fsa%3Dt%26rct%3Dj%26q%3Dmcguffey%2520readers%25201836%26source%3Dweb%26cd%3D11%26ved%3D0CEAQFjAAOAo%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fdigitalcommons.liberty.edu%252Fcgi%252Fviewcontent.cgi%253Farticle%253D1118%2526context%253Deduc_fac_pubs%26ei%3DYLKsToDNDovKiQK4xbilCw%26usg%3DAFQjCNF5fBtUGFzyogMOEmykb3rPkcjMJQ#search=%22mcguffey%20readers%201836%22|title= McGuffey Readers|work=Liberty University|date= 2008|accessdate=October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Ron Powers notes that the Readers affected the first mass-educated and 
mass-literate generation in the modern world. 
 
[[File:McGuffey Reader Set.png|thumb|Henry Ford's childhood set of McGuffey's Readers]]
The manufacturer [[Henry Ford]] cited McGuffey's Readers as one of his most important childhood influences. He was an avid fan of McGuffey's Readers first editions, and claimed as an adult to be able to quote from McGuffey's by memory at great length. Ford republished all six Readers from the 1867 edition and distributed complete sets of them, at his own expense, to schools across the United States. In 1934, Ford had the log cabin where McGuffey was born moved to [[Greenfield Village]], Ford's museum of [[Americana]] at [[Dearborn, Michigan]]. In 1936, Ford was an associate editor (along with [[Hamlin Garland]], [[John W. Studebaker]] and [[William F. Wiley]]) of a collection of excerpts from McGuffey Readers. This 482-page compendium was dedicated to Ford, "lifelong devotee of his boyhood Alma Mater, the McGuffey Readers".

American composer [[Burrill Phillips]] composed a work entitled ''Selections from McGuffey's Reader'', for orchestra, based on poems by [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] and [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]]  It was completed in 1933.

The '''Modern Schools''', also called '''Ferrer Schools''', were [[school]]s in the [[United States]], established in the early twentieth century, that were modeled after the [[Escuela Moderna]] of [[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]], the Spanish educator and [[anarchism|anarchist]]. They were an important part of the anarchist, [[Anarchistic free school|free schooling]], [[socialism|socialist]], and [[labor movement]]s in the U.S., intended to educate the working-classes from a [[secular]], [[class-conscious]] perspective. The Modern Schools imparted day-time academic classes for children and night-time continuing-education lectures for adults.

==The Modern School, New York City==
The first, and most notable, of the American Modern Schools was founded in New York City, in 1911, two years after [[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]]’s execution for [[sedition]] in monarchist Spain on 18 October 1909, and housed children of strikers from the [[1912 Lawrence textile strike]] and [[1913 Paterson silk strike]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |agency= |title=May Day Parades By 50,000 Workers |quote= |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=May 2, 1913 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly called the '''Ferrer Center''', it was founded by notable anarchists — including [[Leonard Dalton Abbott|Leonard Abbott]], [[Alexander Berkman]], [[Voltairine de Cleyre]], and [[Emma Goldman]] — first meeting on [[St. Mark's Place]], in Manhattan’s [[Lower East Side, Manhattan|Lower East Side]], but twice moved elsewhere, first within lower Manhattan, then to 103 East 107th Street in [[Harlem]]. The Ferrer Center opened with only nine students, one being the son of [[Margaret Sanger]], the [[contraceptives]]-rights activist. [[Man Ray]] enrolled in the autumn of 1912 as a night-time continuing-education student&lt;ref name=Conv2Mod&gt;[[Francis Naumann]]; &lt;cite&gt;[http://tfaoi.org/aa/3aa/3aa655b.htm Conversion to Modernism: The Early Work of Man Ray]&lt;/cite&gt;; Rutgers University Press; {{ISBN|0-8135-3148-9}} (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vWtdCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=Modern|title=Man Ray: Writings on Art|first=Jennifer|last=Mundy|date=1 March 2016|publisher=Getty Publications|accessdate=1 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://graphicarts.princeton.edu/2017/08/27/the-modern-school-and-ferrer-colony/|title=The Modern School and Ferrer Colony|author=|date=27 August 2017|website=princeton.edu|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X6X_AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA158&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=Modern|title=The Modern School Movement: Anarchism and Education in the United States|first=Paul|last=Avrich|date=14 July 2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|accessdate=1 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phillipscollection.org/research/american_art/bios/ray-bio.htm|title=Man Ray - Bio|author=|date=|website=phillipscollection.org|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trompeteler.com/2013/01/man-ray-and-the-societe-anonyme/|title=Man Ray and the Société Anonyme, New York -|author=|date=|website=trompeteler.com|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/07/arts/art-review-emmanuel-radnitzky-before-he-was-man-ray.html|title=ART REVIEW; Emmanuel Radnitzky, Before He Was Man Ray|first=Grace|last=Glueck|date=7 March 2003|publisher=|accessdate=1 April 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking life drawing classes supervised by [[Robert Henri]] and [[George Bellows]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.all-art.org/art_20th_century/man_ray1.html|title=History of Art: Man Ray|author=|date=|website=all-art.org|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollistaggart.com/artists/man-ray|title=Man Ray|author=|date=|website=Hollis Taggart Galleries|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/3aa/3aa432.htm|title=Robert Henri and His Influence|author=|date=|website=tfaoi.com|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304070304577394304016454714|title=The Surreal Selling of Man Ray|first=Kelly|last=Crow|date=11 May 2012|publisher=|accessdate=1 April 2018|via=wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gvshp.org/blog/2016/09/02/man-ray-the-darling-of-the-revolutionary-set-art-revolution-that-is/|title=Man Ray:  The darling of the revolutionary set (art revolution that is)|author=|date=|website=gvshp.org|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?bioId=110333|title=Man Ray (photographer; painter/draughtsman; American (USA); Male; 1890 - 1976)|author=|date=|website=British Museum|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vWtdCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=Ray|title=Man Ray: Writings on Art|first=Jennifer|last=Mundy|date=1 March 2016|publisher=Getty Publications|accessdate=1 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fRR8eWzRhbYC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=Ray|title=Anarchy &amp; Culture: The Aesthetic Politics of Modernism|first=David|last=Weir|date=1 April 1997|publisher=Univ of Massachusetts Press|accessdate=1 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WcTmuSTJGL4C&amp;pg=PA223&amp;lpg=PA223&amp;dq=Ray|title=Becoming Modern: The Life of Mina Loy|first=Carolyn|last=Burke|date=25 July 1996|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|accessdate=1 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/famous-artists/man-ray.htm|title=Man Ray: Dada Artist, Surrealist Photographer|author=|date=|website=visual-arts-cork.com|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/18/nyregion/art-pre-abstract-expressionist-artist.html|title=Pre-Abstract Expressionist Artist|author=|date=18 September 1988|website=The New York Times|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/articles/unholy-trinity|title=The unholy trinity  - Tate|author=|date=|website=tate.org.uk|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1912, the school’s principal was the philosopher [[Will Durant]], who also taught there. Besides Berkman and Goldman, the Ferrer Center faculty included the [[Ashcan School]] painters [[Robert Henri]] and [[George Bellows]], and its guest lecturers included writers and political activists such as Margaret Sanger, [[Jack London]], and [[Upton Sinclair]].&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul, ''The Modern School Movement'', AK Press (2005), p.212: At the Ferrer Center, Berkman was called “The Pope”, Goldman was called “The Red Queen”.&lt;/ref&gt; Student Magda Schoenwetter, recalled that the school used [[Montessori]] methods and equipment, and emphasised academic freedom rather than fixed subjects, such as spelling and arithmetic.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul, ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America'', “Interview with Magda Schoenwetter”, AK Press (2005), {{ISBN|1-904859-27-5}}, {{ISBN|978-1-904859-27-7}}, p.230: “What everybody is yowling about now — freedom in education — we had then, though I still can’t spell or do multiplication.”&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1914, radical anarchists who frequented the Ferrer Center, and loosely associated with its adult education program, plotted to bomb the mansion of tycoon industrialist [[John D. Rockefeller]]. On failing to enter the Rockefeller estate, they took the bomb back to the Lexington Avenue apartment of [[Louise Berger]] (a school habitué and a Latvian anarchist who edited Emma Goldman's ''[[Mother Earth (magazine)|Mother Earth]]''), where it exploded, killing four people, including three of the bombers, and wounding many others, and brought political notoriety upon the Ferrer Center.&lt;ref name=Avrich&gt;Avrich, Paul, ''The Modern School Movement''. Princeton: Princeton University Press (1980); Avrich, Paul, ''Anarchist Portraits'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|0-691-00609-1}} (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Modern Schools==
After the 4 July 1914 [[Lexington Avenue bombing]], the police investigated and several times raided the Ferrer Center and other labor and anarchist organisations in New York City.&lt;ref name=Avrich/&gt; Acknowledging the urban danger to their school, the organizers bought 68 acres (275,000 m²) in [[Piscataway Township, New Jersey]], and moved there in 1914, becoming the center of the [[Stelton Colony]].&lt;ref name="ic.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ic.org/wiki/ferrer-colony-stelton/|title=Ferrer Colony, Stelton - Fellowship for Intentional Community|author=|date=|website=ic.org|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, beyond New York City, the [[Ferrer Colony and Modern School]] was founded (ca. 1910–1915) in [[Piscataway, New Jersey]] as a Modern School-based community, that endured some forty years.

In 1933, James and Nellie Dick, who earlier had been principals of the Stelton Modern School, founded the Modern School in [[Lakewood, New Jersey]],&lt;ref name=Avrich/&gt; which survived the original Modern School, the Ferrer Center, becoming the final surviving such school, lasting until 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educationrevolution.org/aerogramme11.html AERO-GRAMME #11: The Alternative Education Resource Organization Newsletter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929213939/http://www.educationrevolution.org/aerogramme11.html |date=2011-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Modern School'' magazine==
''The Modern School'' magazine originally began as a newsletter for parents, when the school was in New York City, printed with the manual [[printing press]] used in teaching printing as a profession. After moving to the Stelton Colony, New Jersey, the magazine’s content expanded to poetry, prose, art, and [[Anarchism and education|libertarian education]] articles; the cover emblem and interior graphics were designed by [[Rockwell Kent]]. Artists and writers, among them [[Hart Crane]] and [[Wallace Stevens]], praised ''The Modern School'' as “the most beautifully printed magazine in existence.”{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

'''Norwegian Digital Learning Arena (NDLA)'''  ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''Nasjonal digital læringsarena'') is a joint [[Counties of Norway|county]] enterprise offering open [[digital learning assets]] for [[Upper secondary school (Norway)|upper secondary education]]. In addition to being a compilation of [[Open educational resources|open educational resources (OER)]], NDLA provides a range of other online tools for sharing and cooperation. The legal liability for the joint county programme is carried by [[Hordaland County Municipality|Hordaland County Council]].

NDLA does not take on its own employees, but manages co-workers within the county resource system, as well as co-workers from [[private sector]].
Core activities are organised in teams: Subject material development, technical development, applications management, content management, NDLA interactive, and desk support.&lt;ref&gt;From Chapter 2 in NDLAs Annual Report for 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2006 The [[Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research]] allocated NOK 50 mill for the development of digital learning resources for subjects in secondary education. Among the targets was the intention to enhance the access to and use of digital learning resources in secondary education, and increase the volume and the variety of such resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/kd/dok/andre/brev/utvalgte_brev/2006/digitale-laremidler-i-videregaende-oppla.html?id=91754 Letter from the Ministry of Education dated 19.06.2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Increased volume and diversity were seen as significant conditions for the introduction of free learning material in upper secondary education. The incentive was an amendment imposing the counties to provide free educational material, in print as well as digital, including digital hardware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/1998-07-17-61#KAPITTEL_3 Norwegian Education Act § 3-1. The right to upper secondary education for youth]&lt;/ref&gt;

20 September 2006 the county chief executives of education agreed to establish a joint project to develop digital subject material for all subjects in secondary education. The project was named Norwegian Digital Learning Arena (NDLA).&lt;ref&gt;"Digitale læremiddel i vidaregåande opplæring - Nasjonal digital læringsarena", political issue with case number 200702708-9 in Hordaland County Council&lt;/ref&gt; The preliminary project work started early 2007; all counties except Oslo were parts of the collaboration. The first year the project was fully funded by the Ministry of Education and Research, and on 26 September Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg officially opened Norwegian Digital Learning Arena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hordaland.no/Aktuelt/Arkiv-nyhende/2007/September/Nasjonal-digital-laringsarena-opna-av-statsminister-Stoltenberg/ Norwegian Digital Learning Arena opened by PM Jens Stoltenberg. (From the web site of Hordaland County.)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140605052740/http://www.hordaland.no/Aktuelt/Arkiv-nyhende/2007/September/Nasjonal-digital-laringsarena-opna-av-statsminister-Stoltenberg/ |date=5 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The academic year 2008–2009 subject material for Norwegian, natural science, and health and social care, first year course, was published.

The 18 participating counties took over the further funding of the project, and for the academic year 2009–2010 digital subject material was provided for 17 curricula and more than 30 subject areas.&lt;ref&gt;Many curricula cover more than one subject; it is for example normal that a curriculum for a vocational syllabus is split into three or four different subject areas. Curricula for Norwegian, mathematics, and English also cover more than one subject.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent increases by the year and by school start in 2014 subject material covering approximately 40 curricula and 60 subject areas within upper secondary education is available.

In 2013 [[Akershus]] County decided to withdraw from the project, however, the county resumed its participation from January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akershus.no/file/ec32575da10d58b6582107d0d4343d8c/Sakskart%202%20til%20fylkestinget%2023.09.13.pdf Agenda from the Akershus County Assembly of 23 September 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of visits to the digital learning resources on ndla.no has been rising since the start of the project. Based on ratings by [[Google Analytics]] the figures are:&lt;ref&gt;Figures of ratings quoted from [http://om.ndla.no/brukerstatistikk/ NDLA]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2010: 1 431 017
* 2011: 2 876 541
* 2012: 4 799 181
* 2013: 7 022 812
* 2014: 8 200 000
* 2015 10 000 000
* 2016: 11 800 000
* 2017: 12 400 000 

[[Oslo]] County does not take part in the NDLA project, but is the county with most visits and use of the resources on ndla.no. In 2013 there were 1 139 129 visits from Oslo.

==Technology==
NDLA is developed in the publishing system [[Drupal]] 6. The solution was initially created by the developing group Utdanning.no,&lt;ref&gt;[https://kgv.doffin.no/app/docmgmt/downloadPublicDocument.asp?DVID=292751&amp;FMT=1&amp;AT=15&amp;ID=96478 Basis of qualification from Doffin for acquisition of securing, running, and storage of a digital learning platform for NDLA. ]&lt;/ref&gt; but further development and operation now lies with the Cerpus group. The core code of the system is [[open source software]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://bitbucket.org/ndla/profile/repositories The ndla open source project]&lt;/ref&gt; open for anyone aiming to develop digital learning resources. In 2018 NDLA will relaunch on a [https://github.com/ndlano new technological platform]. 

==Prizes and Nominations==
In 2011 NDLA was nominated for [[European Public Service Award]] (EPSA).&lt;ref&gt;Theme 1 - Nominees: [http://www.epsa2013.eu/en/content/show/&amp;tid=160 European Public Service Award i 2011].&lt;/ref&gt; The prize is awarded annually within the EU/EEC area, the ambition is to develop and improve solutions within public and civil administration. NDLA was candidate for the prize with the entry: NDLA Innovation in Acquisition, Development and Distribution of Digital Learning Resources. A total of 274 initiatives were evaluated, and 15 candidates were shortlisted for the prize.&lt;ref&gt;[http://om.ndla.no/pressemelding-norsk-metode-til-topps-i-europa Press release: Norwegian Way on Top in Europe (from om.ndla.no)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727043551/http://om.ndla.no/pressemelding-norsk-metode-til-topps-i-europa |date=27 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;


In 2014 NDLA won the [[Boldic Award]] for its open and innovative web repository at ndla.no.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boldic.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Boldic_Award_2014_diplom1_original_us_final1.pdf BOLDIC AWARD 2014, Stockholm 23 October 2014, The Boldic Award Jury 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; In the jury statement, it was pointed out that NDLA's project strategy and solutions can be scalable across the Nordic and Baltic countries, and that NDLA provides a unique way of working together to promote distance learning and ICT-supported flexible lifelong learning.


In 2017 NDLA won the [http://www.oeconsortium.org/projects/open-education-awards-for-excellence/2017-oe-award-winners-oer-categories/ Open Educational Resources Awards for best OER Site].

==External evaluations==
The NDLA learning resources are continually evaluated by independent third parties. An external users’ study from 2013 revealed that NDLA was mostly used as supplement to a traditional textbook, and the use was largely managed by the teacher. Students pointed out e-lectures and differentiated tasks as most useful. Both teachers and students emphasized the value of the possibility to differentiate material and tasks designed for students with varying learning capability.&lt;ref&gt;Athenae AS [http://om.ndla.no/system/files/Brukerundersøkelse%20NDLA%202013.pdf Evaluation of NDLA -- User Survey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022222111/http://om.ndla.no/system/files/Brukerunders%C3%B8kelse%20NDLA%202013.pdf |date=22 October 2013 }}, February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procurement and Production==
By publicly inviting tenders NDLA searches the market for digital learning resources to cover the competence aims of the different subject areas. NDLA asks for production services, developing groups of digital learning material, for either parts of, or prospective total solutions for a complete curriculum.

The responsibility for the editorial work, organising, meta-tagging, and putting together the material in the respective subject areas lies with competent editing groups recruited from upper secondary schools in the counties. The contents of each site are quality controlled by academy and university expertise, or otherwise specialists in that particular field. All the core material is published in the two forms of Norwegian.

When the demand is not met by the supply, the editing groups will produce their own material. The publishing companies are invited to collaborate in every round of purchase, and are free to make an offer of their material that will benefit their interests.

==Funding==
The basic income of NDLA rests on a joint contribution from the part-taking counties, of NOK 400, - per student, which constitutes an annual income of estimated NOK 64 mill. In 2013 this figure was lower due to Akershus’ leaving the project.&lt;ref&gt;From chapter 7 in NDLA’s annual report 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 66% of NDLA’s net expenses in 2013 were spent on purchase in the market.&lt;ref&gt;From chapter 8 in NDLA’s annual report 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 NDLA was indicted by the [[Norwegian Publishers' Association]] before the [[European System of Financial Supervisors|European Surveillance Authority]] (ESA). The publishers claimed that the state funding of more than NOK 150 mill did not comply with the international regulation of financial state support, and represented an obstacle to the establishing of a free market for digital learning resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forleggerforeningen.no/filemanager/download_file/file/506285.pdf/rsberetning%202010.pdf Annual Report from Norwegian Publishers' Association 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220105033/http://www.forleggerforeningen.no/filemanager/download_file/file/506285.pdf/rsberetning%202010.pdf |date=20 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The indictment was initially rejected by the [[EFTA Surveillance Authority]] on 12 October 2011,&lt;ref&gt;EFTA Surveillance Authority Press Release 2011-10-12: [http://www.eftasurv.int/press--publications/press-releases/state-aid/nr/1535 State aid: Norwegian support to provider of digital learning material cleared] 12.10.2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eftasurv.int/media/decisions/311-11-COL.pdf EFTA Surveillance Authority decision] 2011-10-12&lt;/ref&gt; but in December 2012 the dismissal was set aside by the EFTA Court after an appeal from the Publishers’ Association. In March 2013 the [[EFTA Court]] announced a formal investigation of the funding of NDLA,&lt;ref&gt;EFTA Surveillance Authority Press Release 2013-03-27: [http://www.eftasurv.int/press--publications/press-releases/state-aid/nr/1905 State Aid: Investigation opened into funding of Norwegian provider of digital learning material]&lt;/ref&gt; and ESA reopened the case. After a close examination ESA reached the same conclusion; the funding of NDLA is in compliance with the rules of state funding.&lt;ref&gt;EFTA Surveillance Authority Press Release 2014-06-26: [http://www.eftasurv.int/press--publications/press-releases/state-aid/nr/2278 State aid: Norwegian support to the provider of digital learning material does not involve state aid]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''open classroom''' is a [[student-centered]] [[learning space]] design format which first became popular in North America in the late 1960s and 1970s, with a re-emergence in the early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.citylab.com/design/2017/04/who-thought-open-classrooms-were-a-good-idea/524421/ “Who Thought 'Open Classrooms' Were a Good Idea?”, CityLab, April 27, 2017].  Retrieved 2017-10-07&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==

The idea of the open classroom was that a large group of students of varying skill levels would be in a single, large classroom with several teachers overseeing them.  It is ultimately derived from the [[one-room schoolhouse]], but sometimes expanded to include more than two hundred students in a single multi-age and [[Educational stage|multi-grade]] classroom. Rather than having one teacher lecture to the entire group at once, students are typically divided into different groups for each subject according to their skill level for that subject.  The students then work in small groups to achieve their assigned goal.  Teachers serve as both facilitators and instructors. 

Certain education professionals, including Professor Gerald Unks at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], strongly support this system particularly with young children.{{cn|date=April 2017}}  If poorly planned or laid out, open classrooms can sometimes lead to problems with noise and poor ventilation.  Classrooms that are physically open are increasingly rare, as many schools that were built "without walls" have long since put up permanent partitions of varying heights.  However, in many places, the open philosophy as an instructional technique continues.&lt;ref&gt;http://larrycuban.wordpress.com/2009/12/05/fad-or-tradition-the-case-of-the-open-classroom/&lt;/ref&gt; Larry Cuban states "To call it a fad would miss the deeper meaning of “open classrooms” as another skirmish in the ideological wars that have split educational progressives from conservatives since the first tax-supported schools opened their doors in the early 1800s."{{cn|date=April 2017}}
 
Piedmont Open/IB Middle School in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], for example, was started as one of the original two magnet [[middle school]]s in Charlotte in the 1970s.  While the other magnet (a "traditional" school) has closed, Piedmont is still functioning as a modified open school thirty years later, all the time housed in a traditional physical plant.

== Open-space school ==
The '''open-space school''' concept was introduced into the [[United States]] in 1965 as an experimental elementary school architecture where the physical walls separating classrooms were removed to promote movement across class areas by teachers.   However, in practice this is not typical since teachers, following social conventions, tend to teach in a traditional manner as if the walls were still present. Further, modern open-space schools tend to use modular furniture to separate class rooms in a manner similar to "[[Cubicle farm]]s" used in many corporate environment.

&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vit.vic.edu.au/SiteCollectionDocuments/PDF/1137_The-Effect-of-the-Physical-Learning-Environment-on-Teaching-and-Learning.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;Advocates of open plan schools argue that students 'should be allowed to learn in ways 
suited to their individual differences' and that the most effective teaching and learning 
strategies allow teachers to work collaboratively with each other and team teach. The 
traditional classroom boxes with desks lined up in rows impede teachers' efforts to work in 
teams and have students 'in the flexible and varied groupings necessary' (Mark, J 2001:5). 

&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vit.vic.edu.au/SiteCollectionDocuments/PDF/1137_The-Effect-of-the-Physical-Learning-Environment-on-Teaching-and-Learning.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;Bunting agrees, saying that 'traditional classrooms must change' and proposes a model of a generic space for students to be co-located with teachers, which are decorated by the students to give them ownership, and teachers and students only move when necessary to access specialised space (Bunting, A 2004:11–12).

Klein found in a 1975 study that third graders with low levels of [[anxiety]] were more creative in open schools than in traditional school. Children with high levels of anxiety showed no differences between open-space and traditional school models. Students in open-spaced schools scored higher on preference for novelty and change.&lt;ref&gt;Elias and Elias 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5568">'''Overlearning''' refers to practicing newly acquired skills beyond the point of initial mastery.  The term is also often used to refer to the [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] theory that this form of practice leads to [[automaticity]] or other beneficial consequences.

== Early studies ==
[[Memory]] researcher [[Herman Ebbinghaus]] performed classical overlearning studies in the late 1890s.&lt;ref name=Murphy&gt;{{cite book|last=Murphy|first=Gardner|title=An Historical Introduction to Modern Psychology|year=1929|publisher=International Library of Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CGs04j1ypooC&amp;pg=PA445&amp;lpg=PA445&amp;dq=murphy+ebbinghaus+historical+introduction+to+modern+psychology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jBNvVC9PuS&amp;sig=GI2yi_uuujOnG2KZufiSb18iSs8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3iKRUcLMMpSQ8wSu4YGAAg&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=murphy%20ebbinghaus%20historical%20introduction%20to%20modern%20psychology&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He noticed that memory for learned material decreased over time (see also [[forgetting curve]]). Ebbinghaus recognized that lists of nonsense syllables became more difficult to recall over time, and some lists required more review time to regain 100% recall. He defined '''overlearning''' as the number of repetitions of material after that material can be 100% recalled.&lt;ref name=Murphy /&gt;

== Contemporary work ==
A 1992 [[meta-analysis]] suggested that overlearning does significantly affect recall over time. It also concluded that the size of this effect may be moderated by the amount of overlearning, task type, and length of retention.&lt;ref name="Driskel et al."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Driskell|first=James E.|author2=Willis, R. P. |author3=Copper, C. |title=Effect of Overlearning on Retention|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|year=1992|volume=77|issue=5|pages=615–622|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.77.5.615}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meta-analysis included 15 studies. These 15 studies tested overlearning effects on physical and cognitive tasks. Both types of task showed an effect of overlearning. The effect size for physical tasks was smaller than the effect size for cognitive tasks.&lt;ref name="Driskel et al." /&gt; The amount of overlearning affected retention: more overlearning led to more retention on both types of task.&lt;ref name="Driskel et al." /&gt;  The length of the retention interval also affected overlearning, but the effects were different for physical and cognitive tasks. Whereas participants overlearning physical tasks increased in ability during the retention interval, participants who overlearned cognitive tasks decreased in recall ability over time.&lt;ref name="Driskel et al." /&gt;

Some recent studies explicitly examined the interaction of overlearning with retention interval, and concluded that the effects of overlearning tend to be fairly short-lived.&lt;ref name="Rohrer &amp; Taylor"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rohrer|first=Doug|author2=Taylor, K.|title=The Effects of Overlearning and Distributed Practise on the Retention of Mathematics Knowledge|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|year=2006|volume=20|pages=1209–1224|doi=10.1002/acp.1266}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohrer et al. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rohrer|first=Doug|author2=Taylor, K. |author3=Pashler, H. |author4=Wixted, J. T. |author5=Cepeda, N. J. |title=The Effect of Overlearning on Long-Term Retention|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|year=2004|volume=19|pages=361–374|doi=10.1002/acp.1083}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overlearning may be more useful in instances when learners only need short-term retention of the material.&lt;ref name="Rohrer et al. 2004" /&gt;

=== Overlearning geography facts and word definitions ===
In one study, researchers examined the effects of overlearning [[geography]] facts or word definitions.&lt;ref name="Rohrer et al. 2004"/&gt;  After one week, overlearners recalled more geography facts and word definitions than non-overlearners, but this improvement gradually disappeared after the study.&lt;ref name="Rohrer et al. 2004"/&gt; This research suggests that overlearning may be an inefficient study method for long-term retention of geography facts and word definitions.&lt;ref name="Rohrer et al. 2004" /&gt; Overlearning improves short-term retention of material, but learners must also spend more time studying. Over time the improvements created by overlearning fade, and the learner is no better off than someone who did not spend time overlearning the material.&lt;ref name="Rohrer et al. 2004" /&gt;

=== Overlearning mathematics ===
In another study, researchers compared the effects of overlearning and distributed practice on [[mathematics]] knowledge.&lt;ref name="Rohrer &amp; Taylor"/&gt; Distributed practice refers to practice that is spaced over time. In Experiment 1, participants completed 10 math problems either all at once or distributed across two sessions. Participants in the distributed practice condition performed no differently from participants in the single-session condition one week later, but distributed practice participants did perform better than single-session participants four weeks later. In Experiment 2, participants completed either three or nine practice problems in one sitting. When participants were retested one or four weeks later, no differences were found between three-problem and nine-problem participants. Researchers found no effect of overlearning on mathematics [[Recall (memory)|retention]].&lt;ref name="Rohrer &amp; Taylor"/&gt;

'''Passive learning''' is a [[Teaching method|method of learning or instruction]] where students receive information from the instructor and internalize it, and "where the learner receives no feedback from the instructor".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/passive-learning.html BusinessDirectory.com, definition].  Retrieved 2016-04-02&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HRQ"&gt;[http://www.units.miamioh.edu/celt/events/docs/CFLING/active%20vs%20passive.pdf Norbert Michel, John James Cater III, Otmar Varela:  ''Active Versus Passive Teaching Styles: An Empirical Study of Student Learning Outcomes'',  Human Resource Development Quarterly, DOI: 10.1002/hrdq, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. / Business].  Retrieved 2016-04-02&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is often used together with ''[[direct instruction]]'' and ''[[lecture|lecturing]]'', with passive learning being the result or intended outcome of the instruction. This style of learning is [[Traditional education|teacher-centered]] and contrasts to [[active learning]], which is [[student-centered]], whereby students take an active or participatory role in the learning process, and to the [[Socratic method]] where students and instructors engage in cooperative argumentative dialogue.  Passive learning is a traditional method utilized in [[factory model school]]s and modern schools, as well as historic and contemporary religious services in churches ([[sermons]]), [[mosque]]s, and [[synagogue]]s.

Passive learning is not simply the outcome of an educational model.  Passive learners may quietly absorb information and knowledge without typically engaging with the information received or the learning experience. They may not interact with others, share insights, or contribute to a dialogue. An estimated 60 percent of people are passive learners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clomedia.com/2013/01/10/engage-passive-learners/ Engage Passive Learnings, Chief Learning Officer, January 10, 2013].  Retrieved 2016-04-02&lt;/ref&gt;

==Passive vs. active learning==
The effectiveness of traditional instruction and passive learning methods have been under debate for some time.&lt;ref name="HRQ"/&gt;  The modern origins of [[progressive education]], with active learning as a component, can be traced back to the 18th century works of [[John Locke]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], both of whom are known as forerunners of ideas that would be developed by 20th century theorists such as [[John Dewey]]. Locke wrote that "truth and knowledge… arise out of observation and experience rather than manipulation of accepted or given ideas".&lt;ref name="Hayes"&gt;{{cite book
|title=The progressive education movement: Is it still a factor in today's schools?
|first=William
|last=Hayes
|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education
|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantages===
Advantages of passive learning include: exposure to new material, greater control by the instructor over the classroom, audience, or students; opportunity for a structured and engaging format; ensuring a complement to the subject matter outside of the [[learning environment]] and [[learning space]]; the ability to clarify course material; presentation of a large amount of information in a short time; instructional materials (lecture notes, handouts, audiovisual media, etc.) can be prepared in advance; important concepts and content can be identified and presented in an organized, structured, and meaningful manner; the potential to facilitate large-class communication.&lt;ref name=cirtl /&gt;  This format can also permit dissemination of materials not yet published or readily available.

A randomized, controlled trial comparing passive (60-minute lecture) and active (30-minute lecture along with interactions between student pairs) showed no differences between the two methods in students' knowledge or attitudes. However, the perception of engagement with the delivered content was lower for the passive learning group.&lt;ref name="Haidet"&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=14739758 | doi=10.1023/B:AHSE.0000012213.62043.45 | volume=9 | title=A controlled trial of active versus passive learning strategies in a large group setting | year=2004 | journal=Adv Health Sci Educ Theory Pract | pages=15–27 | last1 = Haidet | first1 = P | last2 = Morgan | first2 = RO | last3 = O'Malley | first3 = K | last4 = Moran | first4 = BJ | last5 = Richards | first5 = BF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
Disadvantages of passive learning include the required assumption that for learning to be successful, the students will receive the subject matter with "open minds, like empty vessels or sponges"; the instructor will fill the minds of the students with knowledge in order to obtain better examination results.&lt;ref name="McManus"&gt;[https://d32ogoqmya1dw8.cloudfront.net/files/nagt/jge/abstracts/McManus_v49n5p423.pdf Dean A. McManus, ''The Two Paradigms of Education and the Peer Review of Teaching'',  Journal of Geoscience Education, V.49, n.5, November 2001, P423-434].  Retrieved 2016-04-02&lt;/ref&gt; Passive learning allows limited opportunity to assess how well students are learning content and for questions, clarification, or discussion.  Students may be reticent about letting instructors know they do not understand key information and they may be reluctant to ask questions in class.  With no opportunity for application, it does not consistently engage students' use of higher-level cognitive skills.  A standard model is lecture-format with one-way communication which does not engage the listener.  It also requires the instructor to have effective speaking and presentation skills. Students are expected to wait for information to be provided and then to follow directions on what to do with that information. Emphasis is placed on repeating information without reflecting or demonstrating an understanding.  This can result in ''surface processing'' instead of [[Deeper Learning|deeper learning]], less ability to use what is learned, and the study being deemed irrelevant by the students.&lt;ref name=cirtl&gt;{{cite web|title=Lecturing: Advantages and Disadvantages of the Traditional Lecture Method|url=http://www.cirtl.net/node/2570|publisher=CIRTL Network|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The disadvantages of passive learning can be compared to the advantages of active learning.  It has been suggested that while active ''engagement'' with material, students, instructors, etc. might be critical to learning, active ''participation'' may not be.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurodl.org/?p=archives&amp;year=2014&amp;halfyear=2&amp;article=649 Donna Smith and Katy Smith, ''The Case for 'Passive’ Learning – The 'Silent’ Community of Online Learners'', European Journal of Open,  Distance, and E-Learning].

==Background==
Pioneers in Engineering was founded in 2008 by University of California, Berkeley student and [[Tau Beta Pi]] member, Xiao-Yu Fu. The organization's office is in UC Berkeley's O'Brien Hall. Staff members, including University of California undergraduates and graduates, design and assemble robotics starter kits for the competition, develop mentors for the program, and oversee public relations and internal communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pioneers.berkeley.edu/get-involved/join-pie-staff/ |title=Join PiE Staff · Pioneers in Engineering |publisher=Pioneers.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2013}}, the organization has expanded to include 106 staff members.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In preparation for the annual competition, robotic kits are distributed to groups of high schools students, who are paired with undergraduate mentors who assist the teams during the competition. A final tournament is held at the end of the season, allowing the student teams to reveal their work, for which awards are presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pioneers.berkeley.edu/programs/robotics-competition/ |title=Robotics Competition · Pioneers in Engineering |publisher=Pioneers.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sri Lankan Tamil history}}
The '''policy of standardization''' was a policy implemented by the Sri Lankan government in 1971&lt;ref name="worldbank pub"&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTSRILANKA/Resources/App1.pdf The Root Causes of the Ethnic Conflict in Sri Lanka]&lt;/ref&gt;  to rectify disparities created in university enrollment in [[Sri Lanka]] under Colonial rule.&lt;ref name='jej-e3w'/&gt; In 1972, the government added a district quota as a parameter within each language.&lt;ref name="worldbank pub"/&gt;

==The reasoning for the law==

In 1946 minister C. W. W. Kannangara introduced free education in all the government institutions (Schools, government universities) in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailynews.lk/2009/06/08/fea26.asp Daily News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518031057/http://www.dailynews.lk/2009/06/08/fea26.asp |date=2013-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Government funded all the money by bearing the expenses.

Under the [[British India|British]], English was the state language and consequently greatly benefited English speakers. However the majority of Sri Lankan populace lived outside urban areas and did not belong to the social elite, and therefore did not enjoy the benefits of English-medium education. The issue was compounded further by the fact that in Northern and Eastern regions of the island, where a largely [[Tamil people|Tamil]] populace resided,&lt;ref name='jej-e3w'&gt;{{cite book  | last =Jayasuriya  | first =J. E. | title =Education in the Third World  | publisher =[[Indian Institute of Education]]  | year =1981  | location =[[Pune]]  | oclc =  7925123 }}&lt;/ref&gt; students had access to English-medium education through missionary schools regardless of their socio-economy strata. This created a situation where a large proportion of students enrolled in universities throughout the country were English speaking Tamils and [[Sinhalese People|Sinhalese]] from urban centers like Colombo,&lt;ref name='jej-e3w'/&gt; particularly in professional courses such as [[medicine]] and [[engineering]].

==The implementation of the law==
The government policy of standardization in essence was an [[affirmative action]] scheme to assist geographically disadvantaged students to gain tertiary education. The benefits enjoyed by Sinhalese students also meant a significant fall in the number of Tamil students within the Sri Lankan university student populace.

University selection of 1971 was calculated based on language they sit. Numbers of allocations were proportional to the number of participants who sat to the examination in that language. As guaranteed before the exam, Tamil share was dropped to the proportion of the Tamils medium students(According to 1971 consensus 27% of the total population used Tamil as first medium).&lt;ref name="worldbank pub"/&gt;

According to 1971 exam results, a large proportion of the Tamil allocation was enjoyed by Tamils in Jaffna and a large proportion of the Sinhalese share was enjoyed by the Sinhalese in Colombo.

In 1972 government added district quota as a parameter within each languages.&lt;ref name="worldbank pub"/&gt; 30% of university places were allocated on the basis of island-wide merit; half the places were allocated on the basis of comparative scores within districts and an additional 15% reserved for students from under privileged districts.

==The effect of the law==
30% of university places were allocated on the basis of island-wide merit; half the places were allocated on the basis of comparative scores within districts and an additional 15% reserved for students from under privileged districts.

In 1969, the [[Northern Province, Sri Lanka|Northern Province]], which was largely populated by Tamils and comprised 7%&lt;ref name='dos-pds'&gt;''Department of Census and Statistics'', [http://www.statistics.gov.lk/PopHouSat/PDF/Population/p9p1%20Growth.pdf Population by district, size, intercensal increase and average growth rates]&lt;/ref&gt; of the population of the country, provided 27.5 percent of the entrants to science-based courses in Sri Lankan universities. By 1974, this was reduced to 7%.&lt;ref name='jej-e3w'/&gt; However, the hardest hit population group were the urban Tamils and Sinhalese in the [[Western Province, Sri Lanka|Western Province]], which contained 26%&lt;ref name='dos-pds'/&gt; of the islands population. In 1969, the Western Province provided 67.5 percent of admissions to science-based courses. This reduced to 27% in 1974, after the law came into effect.&lt;ref name='jej-e3w'/&gt; The majority of the share enjoyed by Jaffna Tamils were distributed among Tamils in other areas ( Eastern province, Hill country and Muslims) . Majority of the share enjoyed by Colombo was distributed among rest of the Sinhalese.

"In 1971, a system of standardisation of marks was introduced for admissions to the universities, obviously directed against Tamil-medium students (referred to earlier). K.M. de Silva describes it as follows:

'The qualifying mark for admission to the medical faculties was 250 (out of 400) for Tamil students, whereas it was only 229 for the Sinhalese. Worse still, this same pattern of a lower qualifying mark applied even when Sinhalese and Tamil students sat for the examination in English. In short, students sitting for examinations in the same language, but belonging to two ethnic groups, had different qualifying marks.'

He observes that by doing this in such an obviously discriminatory way, 'the United Front Government of the 1970s caused enormous harm to ethnic relations.'

This was not the end; in 1972 the 'district quota system' was introduced, again to the detriment of the [[Sri Lankan Tamil people]]. The (Sinhalese) historian C.R. de Silva wrote:

'By 1977 the issue of university admissions had become a focal point of the conflict between the government and Tamil leaders. Tamil youth, embittered by what they considered discrimination against them, formed the radical wing of the Tamil United Liberation Front. Many advocated the use of violence to establish a separate Tamil state of Eelam. It was an object lesson of how inept policy measures and insensitivity to minority interests can exacerbate ethnic tensions .'

==Reaction==

When the policy was implemented, the urban Sinhalese population had reconciled themselves to the fact that the position of privilege they had enjoyed under the British would not last forever, and the situation had to stabilize at the population level.&lt;ref name='jej-e3w'/&gt; However Tamils saw the policy along communal terms, and strongly opposed the move.&lt;ref name='jej-e3w'/&gt;

== Changing the standardization ==

The language based standardization of university entrance was abandoned in 1977, and introduced different standardization based on merits, district quotas. 80% of the university places were filled in accordance with raw marks scored by students. The remaining 20% of places was allocated to students in districts with inadequate educational facilities.&lt;ref name='jej-e3w'/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11589">'''Pre-assessment ''' is a test [[students]] can take before a new unit to find out what the students need more instruction on and what they may already know. Pre-assessment is a way to save teachers time within the [[classroom]] while teaching new material. It is a great way to find out more about the students, what they are interested in and how they learn best.

There are many types of best [[teaching]] [[best practice|practice]]s. One of them is pre-assessment, which helps teachers better understand their students when preparing lessons, and activities to better fit the students in the class. Pre-assessment is a test that can be administered at the beginning of the school year and before new units. The same test may also be used for the post-assessment. Pre-assessment also helps the teacher learn student's interests and individual learning styles of each student. There are many ways to differentiate instruction for students that will help students take in information in multiple ways. All this information can be organized in a way to help the students and teachers have an easier school year. It can take place at the beginning of the [[school]] year and also before each unit.

==Differentiated instruction==
{{main article|Differentiated instruction}}
Some teachers assume best practices in their classroom, include such things as students sitting on the floor, listening to music, drawing, being loud or being quiet but doing so as a class. Because these students are doing these things as a class it is not differentiated Instruction. Amy Benjamin writes differentiated instruction is a "variety of classroom practices that allow for differences in students' [[learning styles]], [[interest]]s, prior knowledge, socialization needs and comfort zones".&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, Amy. 2003. Differentiated instruction: A guide for Elementary School Teachers. Larchmont, NY: Eye on Education.&lt;/ref&gt; To learn students individual needs we as teachers need to assess those students and pre-assessment can to be done at the beginning of the school year and to identify students learning modalities, interests and readiness for content.

===Modalities===
There are two types of modality theories; one is learning styles theory, the other is [[multiple intelligence]]. Learning style theory suggests that learning styles differ from student to student. A few examples of learning styles are active learners, verbal learners, and reflective learners. [[Learning styles#Criticism|Learning styles theory]] is highly criticized and lacks empirical evidence to support it. Another type of modality is multiple intelligence, which was created by [[Howard Gardner]]. He takes a physiological approach to multiple intelligence by breaking it into eight categories. These categories help teachers understand the different types of diverse learning abilities. First is logical/mathematical which means the student learns better with logic, reasoning and numbers. Verbal/ Linguistic is another way that the students' strengths are with words and language. Another type is visual/spatial in which a student would rather use graphs, charts and drawings. Students who enjoy sound, rhymes, and music are musical/rhythmical learners. Bodily/kinesthetic learners are better with their hands and have better control over their bodily motions. Another type is Naturalist/Environmental, these students are sensitive, nurturing and like to use all five sense. The seventh is interpersonal, a type of student who communicates well and can be an extrovert. Last, students who can self-reflect and are introverts they are intrapersonal learners. Multiple intelligence is a great way to separate students out and learn their best learning modality.

===Interests===
During pre-assessment, teachers have to learn about students' interests and readiness for the content in order to help motivate the students. However, students have to be the ones who motivate themselves. We as teachers have to grab their attention by utilizing what we know about their interests. Once we know the students interests we can integrate it into the lesson plans. Lynda Rice uses the example that if a student has trouble writing complete sentences use his interests to help him become motivated. A way to do that is by incorporating the students favorite things, which in this case was a superhero. The student was told to write conversation bubbles between other [[superheroes]] or even the [[villain]]s. This helped him become motivated to write complete sentences.

===Readiness for content===
The purpose of pre-assessment of readiness is to find out what the students know and don't know to help plan your lessons to your specific students each year. Every year teacher's students are different. You may not be able to teach the same units the same way because of the classes readiness. At the beginning of the year and before new units it would be best to do a pre-assessment of the students to see what they know. The teachers should also give parents an evaluation in the beginning of the year because they know their child best. Planning and preparing for a class day is difficult, having these pre-assessments done will help you spend more time teaching students what they don't know and just refreshing them on what they do already do know. For example, if you are going to be starting a new unit in math, how to add and subtract.  Just by asking the students "What does addition mean?", "What does subtraction mean" and, "Do they relate to each other?", the teacher would be able to know that the students had a good basic knowledge of the information and could start on application-based activities.
Doing pre-assessment before each unit could help teachers using their time teaching students new information and save time by not teaching them what they may already know with remediation. There are many examples of ways to determine the classes understanding of different subjects. They can be used with formative and summative assessments not just pre-assessment. Once the teacher has decided on the next unit of study they can have the students trace their hands on a piece of paper. On one hand they can write 5 things they already know about the subjects and on the other hand they can write what they wish to know about the subject. This can be done with partners or individually. Teachers can use this to plan the unit and could also use it as another activity by having the students research and answer their own questions. Teachers can also create a worksheet or use note cards to have the students do as homework to get into the classroom the next day. Just asking them "What do you know about the topic?", "Is this topic interesting to you?". Another way is to give the class a test and go over the answers with them, allowing them to correct their own test and find prior knowledge. Using end-of-unit tests can be a great thing for the students; it helps them recognize the important parts of the upcoming unit. There are many ways to find out what students know about subjects that will help you better prepare and spend time wisely within the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, L. (2013). Pre-Assessment. In Common sense assessment in the classroom (pp. 25-46). Huntington Beach, CA: Shell Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluating==
Pre-assessment should always be evaluated but never with grades (Rice, 2013). Teachers should use checkmarks, symbols and highlighter to help find where the students need the most instruction. These assessments should be used to create teachers lesson plans and help the teacher find the best approach for the new unit. The best way to assess is to use graphic organizers, which will be described greater detail below. Evaluation is an ongoing process throughout the school year. As the students learn and grow so will their knowledge and abilities.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, T. (2002). Differentiated instruction. Wakefield, MA: National Center on.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a study done about India curriculum and that evaluated the effectiveness of pre- and post- assessment. Overall the findings showed that pre- and post assessment had a positive effect on the students learning. The student had increased their average score 11% from the pre-assessment to post. In pre-assessment they were given a subjective method of asking what they already know or do not know about the subject. They also were given an assessment that was an objective method that asked yes/no questions. For example, was the information was easy to understand, useful, and well organized.&lt;ref&gt;Jin, Byoungho, &amp; Bennur, Shubhapriya. (2012). Curriculum Internationalization Focusing on India: Pre- And Post-Assessment of Student Learning. Journal of Teaching in International Business, 23(1), 31-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizing data==
Graphic organizers may be the best way to organize the data from pre-assessment. Making a prescription for differentiation sheet is a great way to do that. It incorporates all the data into four categories, such as learning styles, multiple intelligences, interests and readiness for content. Each student would have here own sheet filled out and can be used for planning lessons throughout the year. These are great for students who are bored, or unmotivated. These sheets can also be used for creating groups for the class and finding students that may work well together. Teachers must also organize their classroom management and delivery strategies to effectively operate a classroom with differentiated instruction.

==Learning cycle==
To summarize pre-assessment is a great way to start off the school year, whether it is a test or a worksheet is up to the teacher. For starting a new unit having it be a pre-test would be in the best interest of the students and the teacher. This way the teachers can you the same test for the pre- and post-assessment. This will allow students to know what will be on the test and also allow teachers to know what they need to spend more time on. One option you may decide to add onto the pre-assessment of a new unit would be a choice of "I do not know". Showing the student that it is all right to not know the correct answer. After the pre-assessment is complete teachers need to [[evaluate]] and organize that data, and create or adjust their lesson plan. Teachers may use the pre-assessment from the beginning of the year to create groups for projects or create a new activity based on the students interests. Once the students are taught and are ready to be assessed again the teacher may make a new test or use the pre-assessment again. Pre-assessment can be used in many ways and can be effective in any classroom if used properly.

The '''Rosetta Project''' is a global collaboration of language specialists and native speakers working to develop a contemporary version of the historic [[Rosetta Stone]] to last from 2000 to [[Timeline of the far future#Technology and culture|12,000]] AD; it is run by the [[Long Now Foundation]]. Its goal is a meaningful survey and near permanent archive of 1,500 [[language]]s. Some of these languages have fewer than one thousand speakers left. Others are considered to be dying out because government centralization and [[globalization]] are increasing the prevalence of [[English language|English]] and other major languages. The intention is to create a unique platform for [[comparative linguistics|comparative linguistic]] research and education, as well as a functional linguistic tool that might help in the recovery or revitalisation of lost languages in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/linguafranca/2012-03-24/3903626 The Rosetta Project], Presented by Maria Zijlstra on Lingua Franca, 24 March 2012, ABC Radio National (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.longnow.org/02011/03/07/dr-laura-welcher-the-rosetta-project-the-language-commons/ Dr. Laura Welcher – The Rosetta Project &amp; The Language Commons], March 7th, 2011, by Austin Brown, Blog of the Long Now&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is creating this broad language archive through an open contribution, open review process similar to the strategy that created the original ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.  The resulting archive will be publicly available in three different media: a [[HD-Rosetta]] micro-etched [[nickel]] [[alloy]] disc three inches (7.62 cm) across with a 2,000 year life expectancy; a single volume monumental reference book; and a growing online archive. &lt;!-- I thought the metal was going to be [[Monel]]; did they change it, or did whoever write this not know the name/that we have an article on it? --&gt;

==Concept==
[[File:World population spoken languages.svg|thumb|200px|Fifty to ninety percent of the world's languages (in red) are predicted to disappear in the next century]]

Fifty to ninety percent of the world's languages are predicted to disappear in the next century, many with little or no significant documentation. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Much linguistic description, especially the description of languages with few speakers, remains hidden in personal research files or poorly preserved in under-funded archives.

As part of the effort to secure this critical legacy of linguistic diversity, the Long Now Foundation plans a broad online survey and near-permanent physical archive of 1,500 of the approximately 7,000 human languages.

The project has three overlapping goals:

# to create an unprecedented platform for comparative linguistic research and education
# to develop and widely distribute a functional linguistic tool that might help with the recovery of lost or compromised languages in unknown futures
# to offer an aesthetic object that suggests the immense diversity of human languages as well as the very real threats to the continued survival of this diversity

The 1,500-language [[corpus linguistics | corpus]] expands on the parallel-text structure of the original Rosetta Stone through archiving ten descriptive components for each of the 1,500 selected languages.

The goal is an [[Open-source software|open source]] "[[Linux]] of [[Linguistics]]"—an effort of collaborative online scholarship drawing on the expertise and contributions of thousands of academic specialists and native speakers around the world. The project is also organising formal archive research groups at [[Stanford University|Stanford]], [[Yale University|Yale]], [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], the American [[Library of Congress]], and the American [[SIL International|Summer Institute of Linguistics]] (and its offices in [[Dallas]]).

The resulting Rosetta archives are publicly available in three different media:

# a free and continually growing online archive, also available as a DVD;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interactive Disk |url=https://rosettaproject.org/disk/interactive/ |website=Rosettaproject.org |accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# a single-volume monumental reference book;{{cn|date=June 2018}}
# an extreme-longevity micro-etched disc.

A "Version 1.0" of the [[HD-Rosetta]] disc was completed on November 3, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.longnow.org/2008/11/03/macro-to-micro-etching/ Macro to micro etching], November 3rd, 2008, by Alexander Rose, The Long Now Foundation's Blog&lt;/ref&gt; The disc contains over 13,000 pages of information using over 1,500 languages,&lt;ref name="weardisk"/&gt; which can be read after magnifying by 650 times with a microscope.

In early 2017, the Rosetta Wearable Disk was released.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Blakemore |first1=Erin |title=This Necklace Contains All of the World’s Languages |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/necklace-contains-all-worlds-languages-180961876/ |website=Smithsonian.com (Smart News) |publisher=Smithsonian |accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed using a similar manufacturing process as the first edition of the Rosetta Disk, the main difference being that the final archive is about 2 cm in diameter, thus enabling wearing as an ornament on the human body. One side has instructions in eight different languages and scripts (Bahasa Indonesia, English, Hindi, Mandarin, Modern Standard Arabic, Spanish, Swahili, and Russian), and the other an archive of over 1000 human languages assembled in 2016. By November 2017, the initial run of 100 disks had all been sold, but new releases are planned.&lt;ref name="weardisk"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rosetta Wearable Disk |url=https://rosettaproject.org/disk/wearable/ |website=The Rosetta Project: A Long Now Foundation Library of Human Language |accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sally Ride Science at UC San Diego''' is a nonprofit run by the [[University of California, San Diego]]. It was founded as a company in 2001 by [[Sally Ride]], America's first woman in space, along with [[Tam O'Shaughnessy]], Karen Flammer, Terry McEntee, and Alann Lopes to inspire young people in [[science, technology, engineering, and math]] (STEM) and to promote STEM literacy.&lt;ref name="aboutus-company"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sallyridescience.com/about/|title=Sally Ride Science—About|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=change-the-equation&gt;{{cite web |url=http://changetheequation.org/commitment-to-excellence/sally-ride-science-inc|title= Change the Equation|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="temporal-dynamics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tdlc.ucsd.edu/about/about-sally-ride-science.html|title=Sally Ride Science officially joins TDLC as a corporate partner.|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sally Ride Science was relaunched at UC San Diego on October 1, 2015.&lt;ref name=kpbs-srs&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bowler|first1=Matthew|title=Sally Ride Science becomes part of UC San Diego|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2015/oct/26/sally-ride-science-becomes-part-uc-san-diego/|website=[[KPBS Public Media|KPBS]]|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based at UC San Diego Extension, and its programs are coordinated jointly by UC San Diego Extension, [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]], and [[San Diego Supercomputer Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Piercey|first1=Judy|last2=Davies|first2=Jennifer|title=Sally Ride Science launches at UC San Diego|url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/feature/sally_ride_science_launches_at_uc_san_diego|website=UCSD News|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Shaughnessy is executive director and Flammer is director of education for Sally Ride Science at UC San Diego.

Sally Ride Science at UC San Diego focuses on professional development for teachers; K-12 STEM + Arts (STEAM) education, including courses, lectures, and camps; and online programs through UCTV.&lt;ref name=kpbs-srs /&gt; The goal is to help educators build students’ STEM literacy and make connections between what students are learning and the STEM fields that are expected to experience rapid job growth in the coming decades. The nonprofit will create new programs and make use of existing Sally Ride Science programs.

Existing programs include ''Cool Careers in STEM'', which provides professional development for teachers and classroom resources (student books, teacher guides, and a STEM Career Connections Teacher Activity Guide) to awaken students’ interest in STEM topics and careers. Research shows that learning about STEM careers and the diverse people working in these fields inspires students and makes the study of science, technology, engineering, and math more meaningful to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Practice Guides: Encouraging Girls in Math and Science|url=http://ies.ed.gov/ncer/pubs/practiceguides/20072003.asp|website=National Center for Education Research|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major existing program is ''Key Concepts in Science''. This integrated standards-based program provides professional development for educators on how to teach science using the [[5E instructional model]], along with classroom resources (student books, hands-on investigations, teacher guides, and assessments) that educators can use to build students’ STEM literacy and college and career readiness. The program reflects research showing that teaching fewer science concepts in greater depth gives students a solid foundation to develop STEM literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Next Generation Science Standards|url=http://www.nextgenscience.org/next-generation-science-standards|website=[[Next Generation Science Standards]]|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* created and ran a National Engineering Design (TOYchallenge) competition for eight years and created a documentary film (''Some Assembly Required'') following five teams of boys and girls during the 2008 competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://student.societyforscience.org/article/toy-challenge|title=^"TOYchallenge: A toy design contest encourages both girls and boys to take an interest in engineering."|website=Student Science|accessdate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* created 90 STEM and STEM careers books with comprehensive teacher guides, and more than 200 hands-on STEM investigations.&lt;ref name="SRS"/&gt;
* developed and held the Sally Ride Science Academy for six years, using a train-the-trainer model.
* trained more than 30,000 teachers and reached more than 6 million students with STEM and STEM careers books.&lt;ref name="SRS" /&gt;
* operated EarthKAM (based on Sally Ride's idea to let students take photos of Earth from space and use them in their studies), engaging more than 600,000 students and their teachers in 80 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Growing Young Scientists|url=http://global.jaxa.jp/article/interview/vol59/index_e.html|website=JAXA|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* helped spark the national discussion and shift the national perspective on the importance of involving girls and underrepresented minority students in STEM as they go through school and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marklein|first1=Mary Beth|title=Astronaut Sally Ride’s educational legacy lives on|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2013/05/16/astronaut-sally-rides-educational-legacy-lives-on/2164575/|website=USA Today|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53725">'''Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics''' ('''STEM'''), previously [[Science]], [[Math]], [[Engineering]] and [[Technology]] ('''SMET'''), is a term used to group together these [[academic disciplines]].&lt;ref name="fas.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42642.pdf|format=PDF|title=Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Education: A Primer|website=Fas.org|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term is typically used when addressing education policy and [[curriculum]] choices in schools to improve competitiveness in science and technology development. It has implications for workforce development, national security concerns and immigration policy.&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt;

The [[acronym]] came into common use shortly after an interagency meeting on science education held at the US [[National Science Foundation]]{{when?|date=May 2018}} chaired by the then NSF director [[Rita Colwell]].&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{Cite web|url= http://www.naplesnews.com/opinion/perspectives/guest-commentary-a-stem-in-collier-county-to-reach-their-future-2392f62e-9c19-2198-e053-0100007f6ee5-341858231.html|title= Guest commentary: A "STEM" in Collier County to reach their future|website= Naplesnews.com|access-date= 2016-06-09 | quote = The acronym STEM was suggested by Rita Colwell, Ph.D., a bacteriologist who was director of NSF in the 1980s.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
A director from the Office of Science division of Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists, Peter Faletra, suggested the change from the older acronym SMET to STEM. Colwell, expressing some dislike for the older acronym, responded by suggesting NSF institute the change. However, the acronym STEM predates NSF and likely traces its origin to Charles Vela, the founder and director of the Center for the Advancement of Hispanics in Science and Engineering Education (CAHSEE)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cahsee.org/about/about.asp.htm|title=CAHSEE - About CAHSEE|website=www.cahsee.org|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stem.ccny.cuny.edu/|title=STEM Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics - Main|website=stem.ccny.cuny.edu|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kqnRETS9FWwC|title=Hispanic Engineer &amp; IT|last=Group|first=Career Communications|date=1996|publisher=Career Communications Group|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In the early 1990's CAHSEE started a summer program for talented under-represented students in the Washington, DC area called the STEM Institute.  Based on the program's recognized success and his expertise in STEM education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=100381&amp;org=HRD&amp;from=news|title=President Bush Honors Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring {{!}} NSF - National Science Foundation|website=www.nsf.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Charles Vela was asked to serve on numerous NSF and Congressional panels in science, mathematics and engineering education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cahsee.org/about/founder.asp.htm|title=CAHSEE - Founder's Biography|website=www.cahsee.org|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;; it is through this manner that NSF was first introduced to the acronym STEM.  One of the first NSF projects to use the acronym{{cn|date=May 2018}} was STEMTEC, the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Teacher Education Collaborative at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], which was founded in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;

==Geographic distribution==

===United States===

In the United States, the acronym began to be used in education and immigration debates in initiatives to begin to address the perceived lack of qualified candidates for high-tech jobs. It also addresses concern that the subjects are often taught in isolation, instead of as an integrated curriculum.&lt;ref name="STEM PA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iu1stemcenter.org/files/CMU_and_IU_STEM_Survey.pdf |title=STEM Education in Southwestern Pennsylvania |year=2008 |publisher=The Intermediate Unit 1 Center for STEM Education |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining a citizenry that is well versed in the STEM fields is a key portion of the [[public education]] agenda of the United States.&lt;ref name="USNEWS2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/stem-education/2012/07/26/us-news-inducts-five-to-stem-leadership-hall-of-fame |title=U.S. News Inducts Five to STEM Leadership Hall of Fame |date=July 26, 2012 |author=Morella, Michael |publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The acronym has been widely used in the immigration debate regarding access to United States [[work visa]]s for [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]] who are skilled in these fields. It has also become commonplace in education discussions as a reference to the shortage of skilled workers and inadequate education in these areas.&lt;ref name="Bill Clinton Lays Out"&gt;{{cite news

| accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term tends not to refer to the non-professional and less visible sectors of the fields, such as electronics assembly line work.

====National Science Foundation====
Many organizations in the United States follow the guidelines of the [[National Science Foundation]] on what constitutes a STEM field. The NSF uses a broader definition of STEM subjects that includes subjects in the fields of [[chemistry]], [[Computer science|computer]] and [[information technology]] science, engineering, geosciences, life sciences, mathematical sciences, physics and astronomy, [[social sciences]] ([[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[psychology]] and [[sociology]]), and STEM education and learning research.&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nsf.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2012/nsf12599/nsf12599.htm#appendix|title=Graduate Research Fellowship Program|work=nsf.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eligibility for scholarship programs such as the CSM STEM Scholars Program use the NSF definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmd.edu/istem/scholarship_stem.html |title=ISTEM – College of Southern Maryland }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NSF is the only American federal agency whose mission includes support for all fields of fundamental science and engineering, except for medical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/about/what.jsp |title=What We Do |publisher=The National Science Foundation |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its disciplinary program areas include scholarships, grants, fellowships in fields such as biological sciences, computer and [[information science]] and  engineering, education and human resources, engineering, environmental research and education, geosciences, international science and engineering, mathematical and physical sciences, social, behavioral and economic sciences, cyberinfrastructure, and polar programs.&lt;ref name="nsf.gov"/&gt;

====Immigration policy====
Although many organizations in the United States follow the guidelines of the [[National Science Foundation]] on what constitutes a STEM field, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) has its own functional definition used for immigration policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42530.pdf|format=PDF|title=Immigration of Foreign Nationals with Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Degrees|website=Fas.org|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, DHS or ICE announced an expanded list of STEM designated-degree programs that qualify eligible graduates on student visas for an optional practical training (OPT) extension. Under the OPT program, international students who graduate from colleges and universities in the United States are able to remain in the country and receive training through work experience for up to 12 months. Students who graduate from a designated STEM degree program can remain for an additional 17 months on an OPT STEM extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DHS Expands List of STEM designated-degree programs|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/dhs-expands-list-stem-designated-degree-programs |publisher=Fowler White Boggs P.A. |author=Jennifer G.

====STEM-eligible degrees in US immigration====
{{Details|topic=Temporary foreign workers|Global labor arbitrage|H-1B visa|Optional Practical Training}}

An exhaustive list of STEM disciplines does not exist because the definition varies by organization. The [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] lists disciplines including&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ice.gov/sevis/stemlist.htm |title=STEM Designated Degree Programs |date=April 2008 |publisher=U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[physics]], [[actuarial science]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[mathematics]], [[applied mathematics]], [[statistics]], [[computer science]], [[computational science]], [[psychology]], [[biochemistry]], [[robotics]], [[computer engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[electronics]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[industrial engineering]], [[information science]], [[information technology]], [[civil engineering]], [[aerospace engineering]], [[chemical engineering]], [[astrophysics]], [[astronomy]], [[optics]], [[nanotechnology]], [[nuclear physics]], [[mathematical biology]], [[operations research]], [[neurobiology]], [[biomechanics]], [[bioinformatics]], [[acoustical engineering]], [[geographic information system]]s, [[atmospheric sciences]], [[Educational technology|educational/instructional technology]], [[software engineering]], and [[educational research]].

====Education====
By cultivating an interest in the natural and social sciences in preschool or immediately following school entry, the chances of STEM success in high school can be greatly improved. [[School segregation|School integration]] can  help black, Hispanic and aboriginal students catch up with Asian and white students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

STEM supports broadening the study of [[engineering]] within each of the other subjects, and beginning engineering at younger grades, even elementary school. It also brings STEM education to all students rather than only the gifted programs. In his 2012 budget, President Barack Obama renamed and broadened the "''Mathematics and Science Partnership (MSP)''" to award block grants to states for improving teacher education in those subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/02/obamas-budget-shuffles-stem.html |title=Obama's Budget Shuffles STEM Education Deck |date=14 February 2012 |author=Jane J.

In the 2015 run of the international assessment test the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), American students came out 35th in mathematics, 24th in reading and 25th in science, out of 109 countries. The United States also ranked 29th in the percentage of 24-year-olds with science or mathematics degrees&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pisa/|title=Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) - Overview|website=nces.ed.gov|language=EN|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

STEM education often uses new technologies such as [[RepRap]] [[3D printers]] to encourage interest in STEM fields.&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Irwin, D.E. Oppliger, J.M. Pearce, G. Anzalone, [http://www.asee.org/file_server/papers/attachment/file/0005/4988/asee_K-12_2015_finalpaper.pdf Evaluation of RepRap 3D Printer Workshops in K-12 STEM]. ''122nd ASEE 122nd ASEE Conf.

In 2006 the [[United States National Academies]] expressed their concern about the declining state of STEM education in the United States. Its Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy developed a list of 10 actions. Their top three recommendations were to:
* Increase America's talent pool by improving K–12 science and mathematics education
* Strengthen the skills of teachers through additional training in science, mathematics and technology
* Enlarge the pipeline of students prepared to enter college and graduate with STEM degrees&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slsd.org/webpages/rcolelli/resources.cfm?subpage=493006|title=STEM Education|website=Slsd.org|access-date=2016-06-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126095634/http://www.slsd.org/webpages/rcolelli/resources.cfm?subpage=493006|archivedate=2017-01-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] also has implemented programs and curricula to advance STEM education in order to replenish the pool of scientists, engineers and mathematicians who will lead space exploration in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Individual states, such as [[California]], have run pilot after-school STEM programs to learn what the most promising practices are and how to implement them to increase the chance of student success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://powerofdiscovery.org/sites/default/files/cde_report_task_10_and_11.pdf|format=PDF|title=Final Report : California Department of Education : CDE Agreement|website=Powerofdiscovery.org|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another state to invest in STEM education is Florida, where [https://floridapolytechnic.org/ Florida Polytechnic University], Florida’s first public university for engineering and technology dedicated to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = About Florida Polytechnic University|url = https://floridapolytechnic.org/about/|website = Florida Polytechnic University|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During school, STEM programs have been established for many districts throughout the U.S.  Some states include [[New Jersey]], [[Arizona]], [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], [[Texas]], and [[Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.olentangy.k12.oh.us/domain/1012|title=STEM Academy / Overview|website=www.olentangy.k12.oh.us|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/national-rankings/stem|title=Best STEM High schools|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing STEM education has expanded to the post-secondary level through masters programs such as the University of Maryland's STEM Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.education.umd.edu/MathEd/Outreach/DDP_MCPSSTEM%20.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910215842/http://www.education.umd.edu/MathEd/Outreach/DDP_MCPSSTEM%20.html |archivedate=2014-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the University of Cincinnati.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mastersed.uc.edu/masters-degree-in-education-online-programs/stem-science-technology-engineering-mathematics-teacher-degree/stem-degree-that-inspires-innovation/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910200320/http://mastersed.uc.edu/masters-degree-in-education-online-programs/stem-science-technology-engineering-mathematics-teacher-degree/stem-degree-that-inspires-innovation/ |archivedate=2014-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Racial gap in STEM fields====
In the United States, the National Science Foundation found that the average science score on the 2011 National Assessment of Educational Progress was lower for black and Hispanic students than white, Asian, and Pacific Islanders.&lt;ref&gt;"Science and Engineering Indicators 2014." S&amp;E Indicators 2014 - Figures - US National Science Foundation (NSF). N.p., n.d. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, eleven percent of the U.S. workforce was black, while only six percent of STEM workers were black.&lt;ref&gt;Landivar, Liana C. Disparities in STEM Employment by Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin . Rep. N.p.: n.p., 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Though STEM in the U.S. has typically been dominated by white males, there have been considerable efforts to create initiatives to make STEM a more racially and gender diverse field.&lt;ref&gt;"FACT SHEET: President Obama Announces Over $240 Million in New STEM Commitments at the 2015 White House Science Fair." National Archives and Records Administration. National Archives and Records Administration, n.d. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some evidence suggests that all students, including black and Hispanic students, have a better chance of earning a STEM degree if they attend a college or university at which their entering academic credentials are at least as high as the average student's.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Heriot, [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3112683 Want to Be a Doctor? A Scientist?  An Engineer?:  An Affirmative Action Leg Up May Hurt Your Chances], Engage (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

====American Competitiveness Initiative====
In the [[State of the Union Address]] on January 31, 2006, President [[George W. Bush]] announced the [[American Competitiveness Initiative]]. Bush proposed the initiative to address shortfalls in federal government support of educational development and progress at all academic levels in the STEM fields. In detail, the initiative called for significant increases in federal funding for advanced [[R&amp;D]] programs (including a doubling of federal funding support for advanced research in the physical sciences through [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]]) and an increase in U.S. higher education graduates within STEM disciplines.

The ''NASA Means Business'' competition, sponsored by the Texas Space Grant Consortium, furthers that goal. College students compete to develop promotional plans to encourage students in middle and high school to study STEM subjects and to inspire professors in STEM fields to involve their students in outreach activities that support STEM education.

The [[National Science Foundation]] has numerous programs in STEM education, including some for K–12 students such as the ITEST Program that supports The Global Challenge Award ITEST Program. STEM programs have been implemented in some [[Arizona]] schools. They implement higher cognitive skills for students and enable them to inquire and use techniques used by professionals in the STEM fields.

The STEM Academy is a national nonprofit-status organization dedicated to improving STEM literacy for all students. It represents a recognized national next-generation high-impact academic model. The practices, strategies, and programming are built upon a foundation of identified national best practices which are designed to improve under-represented minority and low-income student growth, close achievement gaps, decrease dropout rates, increase high school graduation rates and improve teacher and principal effectiveness. The STEM Academy represents a flexible use academic model that targets all schools and is for all students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stem101.org/about.asp|title=stemacademy|website=Stem101.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[America COMPETES Act]] (P.L. 110-69) became law on August 9, 2007. It is intended to increase the nation's investment in science and engineering research and in STEM education from kindergarten to graduate school and postdoctoral education. The act authorizes funding increases for the [[National Science Foundation]], [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] laboratories, and the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) Office of Science over FY2008–FY2010. Robert Gabrys, Director of Education at NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]], articulated success as increased student achievement, early expression of student interest in STEM subjects, and student preparedness to enter the workforce.

====Jobs====
In November 2012 the [[White House]] announcement before congressional vote on the STEM Jobs Act put President Obama in opposition to many of the Silicon Valley firms and executives who bankrolled his re-election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57556074-38/obama-opposes-silicon-valley-firms-on-immigration-reform/ |title=Obama opposes Silicon Valley firms on immigration reform |date=November 28, 2012 |author=Declan McCullagh |publisher=CNET |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Labor identified 14 sectors that are "projected to add substantial numbers of new jobs to [[Economy of the United States|the economy]] or affect the growth of other industries or are being transformed by technology and innovation requiring new sets of skills for workers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doleta.gov/Youth_services/pdf/STEM_Report_4%2007.pdf |title=The STEM Workforce Challenge: the Role of the Public Workforce System in a National Solution for a Competitive Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Workforce |date=April 2007 |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The identified sectors were as follows: [[advanced manufacturing]], [[Automotive]], [[Construction industry|construction]], [[financial services]], [[geospatial technology]], [[homeland security]], [[information technology]], [[Transportation]], [[Aerospace]], [[Biotechnology]], [[Energy industry|energy]], [[Health care industry|healthcare]], [[Hospitality industry|hospitality]], and [[Retail industry|retail]].

The [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]] notes STEM fields careers are some of the best-paying and have the greatest potential for job growth in the early 21st century. The report also notes that STEM workers play a key role in the sustained growth and stability of the U.S. economy, and training in STEM fields generally results in higher wages, whether or not they work in a STEM field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.doc.gov/Reports/stem-good-jobs-now-and-future|title=STEM: Good Jobs Now and For the Future|work=doc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, there were around 9.0 million STEM jobs in the United States, representing 6.1% of American employment. STEM jobs were increasing around 9% percent per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esa.doc.gov/reports/stem-jobs-2017-update|title=STEM Jobs: 2017 Update {{!}} Economics &amp; Statistics Administration|website=www.esa.doc.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Brookings Institution found that the demand for competent technology graduates will surpass the number of capable applicants by at least one million individuals.  The BLS noted that almost 100 percent of STEM jobs require postsecondary education, while only 36 percent of other jobs call for that same degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publicpolicy.wharton.upenn.edu/live/news/2188-building-americas-future-stem-education/for-students/blog/news.php|title=Building America’s Future: STEM Education Intervention is a Win-Win|website=Penn Wharton Public Policy Initative|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Updates ====
PEW findings revealed that Americans identified several issues that hound STEM education which included unconcerned parents, disinterested students, obsolete curriculum materials, and too much focus on state parameters. 57 percent of survey respondents pointed out that one main problem of STEM is lack of students’ concentration in learning&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thejournal.com/articles/2018/01/12/americans-rate-u.s.-stem-education-as-mediocre.aspx|title=Americans Rate U.S. K–12 STEM Education as Mediocre -- THE Journal|website=THE Journal|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Vietnam ===
In Vietnam, beginning in 2012 many private education organizations has STEM education initiatives.

In 2015, the Ministry of Science and Technology and Liên minh STEM organized the first National STEM day, followed by many similar events across the country.

in 2015, Ministry of Education and Training included STEM as an area needed to be encouraged in national school year program.

In May 2017, Prime Minister signed a [http://vanban.chinhphu.vn/portal/page/portal/chinhphu/hethongvanban?class_id=2&amp;mode=detail&amp;document_id=189610 Directive no. 16] stating: "Dramatically change the policies, contents, education and vocational training methods to create a human resource capable of receiving new production technology trends, with a focus on promoting training in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), foreign languages, information technology in general education; " and asking "Ministry of Education and Training (to): Promote the deployment of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education in general education program; Pilot organize in some high schools from 2017 to 2018.

==Women==

{{see also|Women in science|Women in engineering|Women in computing|Sex differences in psychology|Sex differences in intelligence}}

Women constitute 47% of the U.S. workforce, and perform 24% of STEM-related jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.doc.gov/reports/women-stem-2017-update|title=Women in STEM: 2017 Update| access-date=September 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK women perform 13% of STEM-related jobs (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/business/2014/science-careers-face-diversity-challenge|title=Science careers face diversity challenge|work=westminster.ac.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018110732/http://www.westminster.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/business/2014/science-careers-face-diversity-challenge|archivedate=2014-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. women with STEM degrees are more likely to work in education or healthcare rather than STEM fields compared with their male counterparts.

The gender ratio depends on field of study. For example, in the [[European Union]] in 2012 women made up 47.3% of the total, 51% of the social sciences, business and law, 42% of the science, mathematics and computing, 28% of engineering, manufacturing and construction, and 59% of PhD graduates in Health and Welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|date= 2016|title= She Figures 2015|url= https://ec.europa.eu/research/swafs/pdf/pub_gender_equality/she_figures_2015-final.pdf#view=fit&amp;pagemode=none|publisher= European Commission|page= |access-date= 15 September 2018 |ISBN=978-92-79-48375-2|doi=10.2777/744106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The focus on increasing participation in STEM fields has attracted criticism. In the 2014 article "The Myth of the Science and Engineering Shortage" in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', demographer Michael S. Teitelbaum criticized the efforts of the U.S. government to increase the number of STEM graduates, saying that, among studies on the subject, "No one has been able to find any evidence indicating current widespread labor market shortages or hiring difficulties in science and engineering occupations that require bachelor's degrees or higher", and that "Most studies report that real wages in many—but not all—science and engineering occupations have been flat or slow-growing, and unemployment as high or higher than in many comparably-skilled occupations." Teitelbaum also wrote that the then-current national fixation on increasing STEM participation paralleled previous U.S. government efforts since [[World War II]] to increase the number of scientists and engineers, all of which he stated ultimately ended up in "mass layoffs, hiring freezes, and funding cuts"; including one driven by the [[Space Race]] of the late 1950s and 1960s, which he wrote led to "a bust of serious magnitude in the 1970s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Myth of the Science and Engineering Shortage |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/03/the-myth-of-the-science-and-engineering-shortage/284359/ |first=Michael S. |last=Teitelbaum |work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[IEEE Spectrum]]'' contributing editor Robert N. Charette echoed these sentiments in the 2013 article "The STEM Crisis Is a Myth", also noting that there was a "mismatch between earning a STEM degree and having a STEM job" in the United States, with only around ¼ of STEM graduates working in STEM fields, while less than half of workers in STEM fields have a STEM degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The STEM Crisis Is a Myth |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/education/the-stem-crisis-is-a-myth |first=Robert N. |last=Charette |publisher=IEEE Spectrum |date=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economics writer Ben Casselman, in a 2014 study of post-graduation earnings for ''[[FiveThirtyEight]]'', wrote that, based on the data, science should not be grouped with the other three STEM categories, because, while the other three generally result in high-paying jobs, "many sciences, particularly the [[life sciences]], pay below the overall median for recent college graduates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major |url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/ |first=Ben |last=Casselman |publisher=FiveThirtyEight |date=September 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts to remedy the perceived domination of STEM subjects by men of Asian and non-Hispanic European backgrounds has led to intense efforts to diversify the STEM workforce. However, some critics feel that this practice in higher education, as opposed to a strict [[meritocracy]], causes lower academic standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The art and science of collecting and managing [[Submission (Electronic)|submissions]] (of any kind) is called Submission Management. Traditionally, submissions were collected offline i.e. in the form of 'hard' paper files or folders. However, with the recent penetration of [[Internet]] in almost every sphere of life, there has been a steady shift towards collecting electronic submissions as compared to hard copies of submissions. The Internet has also facilitated a change in the perception towards the deliverables or contents of a submission. As a result of this, submitting audio and video files, pictures and presentations in addition to standard text, [[Word document|word]] and pdf-like documents has become common in the last few years.

Managing submissions may include evaluating submissions and providing feedback to submitters, accepting or rejecting submissions or requesting submitters to make a re-submission. In some cases, a panel of experts may also be requested to assist in the evaluation of submissions by reviewing or judging them.

==Common scenarios==
===Academics===
It is a common practice for teachers, professors and teaching assistants to get [[Assignment (education)|assignments]] and projects submitted by students, either electronically or otherwise. These assignments are graded and the students are given [[Feedback#In_education|feedback]] on whatever they submitted and how can they improve it. In institutes where academic submissions are done electronically, there generally is a [[Learning management system|system]] (usually a web-based one) in place to assist in the collection and management of submissions.

===Call-for-paper (academic) conferences===
In call-for-paper or [[academic conference]]s, prospective presenters are usually asked to submit a short abstract of their presentation or research work, which is reviewed before being accepted for the conference. Some conferences require researchers to submit a full paper of about 6–15 pages, which is [[peer review]]ed by members of the conference's [[program committee]] and/or external reviewers chosen by them.

===Competitions and contests===
Most [[competition]]s and [[Competition|contest]]s held world over usually have an initial screening round in which they accept nominations or entries from prospective participants. After all the [[nomination]]s and entries have been received, the organizers of the competition or contest evaluate and shortlist the required number of entries on the basis of certain parameters set by them, notify the participants whose entries have been shortlisted and invite them to participate in further rounds of the competition or contest. Those whose entries were not shortlisted may also be given feedback by the organizers with a reason for the rejection and tips for improvement.

===College events and fests===
[[Student groups|Student bodies]] in colleges and universities usually organize various inter-college and intra-college events and fests on an annual and/or [[semester]] basis. These events and fests are usually made up of several big and small competitions and contests, each of which generally follow a procedure as explained in the paragraph above.

===Pharmaceuticals industry===
Regulatory submissions in the pharmaceutical–biotechnology and medical device industry comprise documents and data that are submitted to a regulatory agency to gain approval to market new drugs, biologics and devices but also when modifications are introduced in registered data (variations). The documentation represents years of research and includes multi-disciplinary information (including preclinical and clinical data) regarding the safety and efficacy of a compound. The regulatory process varies from country to country and involves numerous interactions between the submitting company (sponsor) and the regulatory authority (agency). Many regulatory agencies accept electronic submissions in conjunction with or in lieu of submitting paper.

===Human resources===
[[Human resources|Human resource]] departments collect [[résumé]]s and [[Curriculum vitae|CVs]] as a part of processing job applications. Applicants submit their résumés either via email, on the website of their prospective employer or on [[employment websites]] that help connect job seekers and employers.

===Contemporary art===
In [[contemporary art]], curators often select and interpret works of art created by various artists. Before the popularity of the Internet, this was often done in person but these days some curators prefer artists submitting pictures of their work over email or by other electronic means for an initial screening. If the curator likes a particular work of art, he may electronically communicate his desire to work with the artist after verifying that the picture is indeed of his work.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===The fashion industry===
[[Model (person)|Models]] create and maintain portfolios which they use to showcase themselves during the process of getting selected for various fashion shows, advertisements and other events in the fashion industry. Those who are responsible for taking a decision on which models to choose usually ask prospective models to submit their portfolios with them. They take their decision after evaluating all the portfolios available with them.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===Publication and media houses===
Journalists and writers (full-time as well as [[freelancer]]s) usually submit their articles and reports to editors of magazines, journals, newspapers and news channels who then select which ones will be published and/or telecasted and which ones won't be. At times, editors even provide feedback to the authors of reports with an intention of seeking pre-publication improvement.

===Government applications===
Most government procedures demand the filling up of a form, either electronically or on paper. Citizens submit their forms to the desired government agency by their preferred mode of communication after which the agency performs an initial verification during which they may contact the concerned person for further information, data or correction of errors. After the verification stage, the forms are marked for processing and the concerned person is intimated once the processing is over. The processing stage may involve external or sister agencies too.

==Challenges==
===Submission standards and formats===
As companies, agencies and institutes move towards [[electronic submission]]s, a lot of complexity has been added in the submission management domain. In the paper world, much of the effort of managing a submission involves printing and collating volumes of information but with electronic submissions, it becomes increasingly difficult to efficiently manage the tens and thousands of submissions coming from different sources, in different formats at different times. As a result, many agencies are in the process of trying to implement global standards for submission formats and standards.

One example of this is the standards put forth by the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) in the context of the pharmaceuticals industry. The ICH has developed the [[electronic Common Technical Document]] (eCTD) to promote harmonization of regulatory submissions in electronic format across various regions (United States, Europe and Japan).&lt;ref name="ICH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://estri.ich.org/eCTD/eCTD_Specification_v3_2.pdf|title=The ICH eCTD Specification V 3.2|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916072404/http://estri.ich.org/eCTD/eCTD_Specification_v3_2.pdf|archivedate=2008-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inappropriate modes and lack of automated systems===
Email is by-far the most popular mode for collecting and managing electronic submissions and post for paper submissions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Since, both these processes are manual to quite an extent, they often lead to delays, inconsistencies and mishaps. In some setups, there are tailor-made systems that help collectors of submissions to some extent but they often fail owing to their ultra specific nature.

The key to successful submission management involves tracking each submission as well as all its versions and sub-parts that may be related to it or dependent on it. In addition to planning and tracking submission content, it is also important to manage and allocate resources effectively based on workload, skill sets and availability. Submission collectors may seek the help of expert [[reviewer]]s or judges in such cases. All these reasons have motivated many companies and researchers to begin looking at submission management as a formal discipline and to start analyzing metrics behind various submission processes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Submission management systems==
Certain software vendors have begun developing [[submission management system]]s to assist submission collectors in the automation, tracking and management of complex submission processes. Most of these systems are [[web based]] and accessible from any device with a browser and an Internet connection. However, a majority of these systems are application specific and cannot be applied to all submission management scenarios. This means that a lot of work needs to be done in this field before we have good and reliable submission management systems that are suitable and usable in every context of submission management.

:''For the term "super senior" in [[finance]], see [[Senior debt#Super-senior status]].''

A '''super senior''' is a student in an American four-year educational institution such as a [[high school]] or [[university]] who has been attending the institution for 5 or more years or has more than the usual number of credits required to graduate without achieving a [[diploma]] or [[bachelor's degree]].

==Causes==
Applied to education in the [[United States]], super-seniors usually have the minimum number of credits to graduate but do not for various reasons. These students will advance through the grades (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior) on schedule and are classified as a "senior" for two or more years.

===Redshirt student-athlete===
A student-athlete may have been made a [[Redshirt (college sports)|redshirt]] their freshman year, which delays their four-year eligibility for competition in the NCAA until their sophomore year. As a result, they will still be eligible the year after their senior year and may stay in college to continue competition.

===Multiple degrees===
Students who intend to complete two or more degrees at the same time are often required to earn approximately 140-150 credits to receive their degrees, rather than the normal 120. It is often in the student's best interest to earn all desired/required undergraduate degrees at the same time as [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial aid]] is more readily available to undergraduates than to graduates returning for additional undergraduate degrees. They could also use summer school sessions as well.

===Change of majors===
Students may choose to change majors after they are well advanced in their schooling. These students often have enough [[Curriculum#Higher education|general education]] credits and overall credits to graduate but do not have their major-specific credits completed.

===Leave of absence===
Students may take a leave of absence from their university for the difficult circumstances described below, or to pursue other endeavors, such as living, working, or studying abroad, tending to a fledgling business, or pursuing opportunities in their chosen career. [[Stanford University]] in particular is known for its sizable constituency of fifth-year (and sometimes even sixth-year) seniors who took time off to volunteer or work overseas. Many of Stanford's more famous alumni have taken a leave of absence and never returned to the school.

Another school well known in this regard is [[Brigham Young University]], the flagship school of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. Many male BYU students, both at the main campus in Utah and at its branch campuses in [[Brigham Young University–Hawaii|Hawaii]] and [[Brigham Young University–Idaho|Idaho]], take two years off during their studies to go on [[Missionary (LDS Church)|LDS missions]]. Before a 2012 change in church policy, female students were much less likely to take time off to serve missions (which, for women, last 18 months). Under the old policy, men were allowed to serve at age 19, while women had to wait until 21 (by which time many would be close to finishing degrees, married, or both). With the new policy, males can go on missions immediately after high school as long as they are at least 18, while females can serve once they turn 19.

===Poor choice of classes===
Super-seniors often include students who chose their classes without considering graduation requirements. They are often missing important requirements for their major or core/general education. Additionally, in changing of majors this creates an important concept in core classes as well as other classes in the curriculum.

===Music majors===
For music majors, participation in music ensembles is an obvious requirement over the course of their college career.  At many colleges, large ensembles (full choir, concert/marching/jazz band, and/or symphony orchestra) rehearse four hours a week for only one credit (typically, the number of credits correspond to hours spent in class per week).  This is to encourage non-music majors to be in the ensembles; however, it is not unusual for music majors to carry 8 classes in a semester for a normal credit load of 15-16 credits. Due to this more intense time commitment, music majors often have to take 2 or more semesters to complete their graduation requirements.

===Low grades===
In many schools, the grade of "D" is enough to receive credit for a class, but not high enough to count towards the student's major or core/general education requirements. A student who receives too many D grades may have enough credits to graduate but not good enough grades.

===Desire to remain in school===
Some super-seniors have enough credits and requirements to graduate, but do not apply for graduation. In most cases, universities do not automatically grant graduation without application, and as long as tuition is paid, students are not forced to leave the school. This is normally not applicable to high school.

Some super-seniors may be in their fifth or later year in the school but do not have enough credits to graduate. These students appear on paper as juniors or (simple) seniors and do not have enough credits to graduate with their peers.

Some super-seniors take a leave of absence or extra majors on purpose to remain in school for as long as possible.

Another example of a student’s desire to remain in school is if the student is an accounting major intending to sit for the [[Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination]].  Most states in the U.S. require CPA candidates to obtain at least 150 semester hours of college education.  One way for a student to obtain the 150 semester hours required for the CPA Exam is to take additional accounting or business courses in the student’s fifth or subsequent years without having to enroll in a postgraduate program.

===Difficult or multiple majors===
Students in high-stress majors such as [[mathematics]] or those who take a difficult double-major (within the same degree) or minor may choose to take a minimum number of classes (two, three, or four depending on the number of credits offered per class) at one time in order to achieve higher grades or superior retention.

===Difficult circumstances===
Occasionally a student becomes ill or is injured in mid-semester and cannot complete/pass the classes he/she has begun. If this occurs after the drop-deadline, the school may make a judgment as to whether to count the grades against him/her or drop the student from the semester. In either case, the student would need an additional semester to graduate.

Students may have other difficulties that prevent them from completing the graduation requirements in the traditional four years, such as raising a child or being required to work full-time. Such students may only attend classes on a part-time basis, taking over a decade to complete a bachelor's degree.

===Failing grades===
Occasionally a student may keep his or her [[grade point average]] high enough to remain in school but still fail enough classes that they do not have enough credits to graduate at the end of his or her four years.

===College Required Classes===
Many times, universities will require classes in order to graduate that fall under the "General Education Requirements" category. Often, universities will offer some of these classes (especially at smaller universities where number of teachers or resources are more limited)  only once every few semesters. In some cases, students find it impossible (due to other courses, employment, or other reasons) to take these courses when they are offered and sometimes need to stay enrolled in the university for an extra semester or year until these classes are offered again.

===Take Five Scholars Program===
At the [[University of Rochester]], students are given the unique opportunity to partake in the Take Five Scholars Program. In this program, the student receives a fifth year, or one additional semester, tuition free while the student studies a subject outside of their major. The student has to apply for this program before their eighth semester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |title=Take Five Scholars Program : Center for Academic Support|url=http://www.rochester.edu/college/CCAS/TakeFive/ |work= |publisher=[[University of Rochester]] |date= |accessdate=2009-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Agnes Scott College]] also offers a Fifth Year program, tuition-free. It is typically used to take courses that interest them but they could not take during their first four years, to finish a second major, or to take classes that are prerequisites for a graduate program they wish to pursue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Post-Baccalaureate Program|url=http://www.agnesscott.edu/Media/Website%20Resources/pdf/academics/catalog/post-baccalaureateprograms.pdf|publisher=Agnes Scott College|accessdate=March 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cooperative Education===
Many colleges and universities offer a [[Cooperative Education]] program.  In this program, a student has the opportunity to integrate work experience into his/her education through [[full-time]] employment during one or more semesters.  Generally, a student will not enroll in any courses during the semester(s) of his/her full-time employment.  Therefore, a student participating in Cooperative Education will require more than four years to complete his/her studies.

===Wait-Listed===
Students are wait-listed when applying for college entrance or when enrolling in classes at their college or university. A spot on a wait-list delays students that are earning credits for core/general education or toward their major. Being wait-listed at the beginning of their college career or at any point during their time at a college or university prevents them from having enough credits to graduate in the traditional four years.

===Transfer students===
Transfer students may have to spend a longer time getting their degrees since different universities have different requirements.  Also, students may transfer to narrow down their major to a specific one; an engineering student at one school may want to transfer to another one to major in a specific type of engineering, for example.

==Effects==

===College or university===
Some universities reduce or withdraw state funding after a student's fifth year.  In addition, parents who are paying for their children's education and living expenses may lose patience and cut their student's funding. Fifth year students are becoming more common as students increasingly choose to progress through difficult courses of study slow paces or pursue multiple majors or degrees. Although States often reduce or withdraw funding, there is still funding available to the students in the form of scholarships, as well as federal money such as work study and student loans.

===High school===
Public high schools may allow a fifth year super-senior who does not have enough credits to graduate to continue attending their regular school, though students older than age 19 are usually required to attend "continuation school" meant for adults who have not graduated with a high school degree. Students forced into continuation school often choose to drop-out or take the [[General Educational Development|GED]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Special education==
In the United States, federal law ([[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act|IDEA]]) states that public (state) schools are required to keep special-needs students in regular public schools (or a [[special education]] school if the student's [[Individualized Education Program|IEP]] warrants it) until they graduate from that school or reach the age of 21.

'''Technology integration''' is the use of technology tools{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} in general content areas in education in order to allow [[students]] to apply [[computer skills|computer]] and [[technology]] skills to learning and problem-solving. Generally speaking, the [[curriculum]] drives the use of technology and not vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.com/articles/14141|title=Teachers of the 21st Century Know the What, Why, and How of Technology Integration|author= Jolene Dockstader|date=December 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why Do We Need Technology Integration? |work=[[Edutopia]] |url=http://www.edutopia.org/teaching-module-technology-integration-why|date=November 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technology integration is defined as the use of technology to enhance and support the educational environment. Technology integration in the classroom can also support classroom instruction by creating opportunities for students to complete assignments on the computer rather than with normal pencil and paper.&lt;ref name="techparticipation.blogspot.in"&gt;{{cite web|title=Using technology to increase student participation|url=http://techparticipation.blogspot.in/2009/09/technology-integration-definition.html|ref=article|date=September 1, 2009|work=techparticipation.blogspot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Curriculum integration with the use of technology involves the infusion of technology as a tool to enhance the learning in a content area or multidisciplinary setting... Effective integration of technology is achieved when students are able to select technology tools to help them obtain information in a timely manner, analyze and synthesize the information, and present it professionally to an authentic audience. The technology should become an integral part of how the classroom functions—as accessible as all other classroom tools. The focus in each lesson or unit is the curriculum outcome, not the technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2003/tech_schools/chapter7.asp|title=Chapter 7: Technology Integration, U.S. Department of Education|date=December 9, 2008|publisher=National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Integrating technology with standard curriculum can not only give students a sense of power, but also allows for more advanced learning among broad topics. However, these technologies require infrastructure, continual maintenance and repair – one determining element, among many, in how these technologies can be used for curricula purposes and whether or not they will be successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1 = Jackson|first1 = Steven|last2 = Pompe|first2 = Alex|last3 = Krieshok| first3 = Gabriel|title = Things Fall Apart: Maintenance, Repair, and Technology for Education Initiatives in Rural Namibia|pages = 283–90|newspaper = Proceedings of the 2011 iConference|location = Seattle, Washington|date = 8–11 September 2011|doi = 10.1007/1-4020-4023-7_24|chapter = The Work to Make a Home Network Work|isbn = 978-1-4020-4022-1|citeseerx = 10.1.1.459.6466}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of the infrastructure required to operate and support technology integration in schools include at the basic level electricity, Internet service providers, routers, modems, and personnel to maintain the network, beyond the initial cost of the hardware and software.&lt;ref name="Grinter"&gt;{{Citation|last1 = Grinter|first1 = Rebecca|title = Ecscw 2005|last2 = Edwards|first2 = W. Keith|pages = 469–488|newspaper = Proceedings of the Ninth European Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work|location = Paris, France|date = 18–22 September 2005|doi = 10.1007/1-4020-4023-7_24|isbn = 978-1-4020-4022-1|citeseerx = 10.1.1.459.6466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standard education curriculum with an integration of technology can provide tools for advanced learning among a broad range of topics. Integration of [[information and communication technology]] is often closely monitored and evaluated due to the current climate of accountability, outcome based education, and standardization in assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Kervin|first1 = Lisa|last2 = Mantei|first2 = Jessica|title = Supporting educators with the inclusion of technology within literacy classrooms: A framework for "action"|journal = Journal of Technology Integration in the Classroom|volume = 2|issue = 3|pages = 43–54|date = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology integration can in some instances be problematic. A high ratio of students to technological device has been shown to impede or slow learning and task completion.&lt;ref name="Yu"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Yu|first = Chien|title = The Integration of Technology in the 21st Century Classroom: Teachers' Attitudes and Pedagogical Beliefs Toward Emerging Technologies| journal = Journal of Technology Integration in the Classroom|volume = 5|issue = 1|pages = 6|date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some, instances dyadic peer interaction centered on integrated technology has proven to develop a more cooperative sense of social relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Mehan|first = Hugh|title = Microcomputers in Classrooms: Educational Technology or Social Practice|journal = Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly|volume = 20|issue = 1|pages = 4–22|date = March 1989|jstor = 3195700|doi=10.1525/aeq.1989.20.1.05x1208l}}&lt;/ref&gt; Success or failure of technology integration is largely dependent on factors beyond the technology. The availability of appropriate software for the technology being integrated is also problematic in terms of software accessibility to students and educators.&lt;ref name="Yu" /&gt; Another issue identified with technology integration is the lack of long-range planning for these tools within the educative districts they are being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Anderson|first = L. S.|year = 1996|title = K–12 technology planning at state, district, and local levels|publisher = National Center for Technology Planning, Mississippi State University }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology contributes to global development and diversity in classrooms while helping to develop upon the fundamental building blocks needed for students to achieve more complex ideas. In order for technology to make an impact within the educational system, teachers and students must access to technology in a contextual matter that is culturally relevant, responsive and meaningful to their educational practice and that promotes quality teaching and active student learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Song|first1 = Shin-Cheol|last2 = Owens|first2 = Emiel|title = Rethinking Technology Disparities and Instructional Practices within Urban Schools: Recommendations for School Leadership and Teacher Training|journal = Journal of Technology Integration in the Classroom |volume = 3|issue = 2|pages = 23–36|date = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term 'educational technology' was used during the post World War II era in the United States for the integration of implements such as film strips, slide projectors, language laboratories, audio tapes, and television.&lt;ref name="Coley"&gt;{{Citation|last1 = Coley|first1 = R. DJ.|last2 = Cradler|first2 = J.|last3 = Engel|first3 = P. K.|title= Computers and Classrooms: The Status of Technology in U.S. Schools|series = Policy Information Report|pages = 1–67|year = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Presently, the computers, tablets, and mobile devices integrated into classroom settings for educational purposes are most often referred to as 'current' educational technologies. It is important to note that educational technologies continually change, and once referred to slate chalkboards used by students in early schoolhouses in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The phrase 'educational technology', a composite meaning of technology + education, is used to refer to the most advanced technologies that are available for both teaching and learning in a particular era.&lt;ref name="Coley"/&gt;

In 1994 federal legislation for both the Educate America Act and the Improving America's School's Act (IASA) authorized funds for state and federal educational technology planning.&lt;ref name="Coley"/&gt; One of the principal goals listed in the Educate America Act is to promote the research, consensus building, and systemic changes needed to ensure equitable educational opportunities and high levels of educational achievement for all students (Public Law 103-227).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants= Goals 2000: Educate America Act|vol= House of Representatives 1804 Amendment|reporter=U.S. Congress|opinion=103|date=8 February 1994|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/103/hr1804/text/ih}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 the Telecommunications Act provided a systematic change necessary to ensure equitable educational opportunities of bringing new technology into the education sector.&lt;ref name="104th Congress"&gt;{{cite court|litigants= TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1996 – 110 STAT. 56.|vol=House of Representatives 1804 Amendment|reporter=U.S. Congress|opinion=104|date=8 February 1996|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/specialuses/commsites/documents/pl-104-104.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Telecomm Act requires affordable access and service to advanced telecom services for public schools and libraries. Many of the computers, tablets, and mobile devices currently used in classrooms operate through Internet connectivity; particularly those that are application based such as tablets. Schools in high-cost areas and disadvantaged schools were to receive higher discounts in telecom services such as Internet, cable, satellite television, and the management component.&lt;ref name="104th Congress"/&gt;

A chart of "Technology Penetration in U.S. Public Schools" report states 98% percent of schools reported having computers in the 1995–1996 school year, with 64% Internet access, and 38% working via networked systems.&lt;ref name="Coley"/&gt; The ratio of students to computers in the United States in 1984 stood at 15 students per 1 computer, it now stands at an average all-time low of 10 students to computer.&lt;ref name="Coley"/&gt; From the 1980s on into the 2000s, the most substantial issue to examine in educational technology was school access to technologies according to the 1997 Policy Information Report for Computers and Classrooms: The Status of Technology in U.S. Schools. These technologies included computers, multimedia computers, the Internet, networks, cable TV, and satellite technology amongst other technology-based resources.&lt;ref name="Coley"/&gt;

More recently ubiquitous computing devices, such as computers and tablets, are being used as networked collaborative technologies in the classroom.&lt;ref name="Grinter" /&gt; Computers, tablets and mobile devices may be used in educational settings within groups, between people and for collaborative tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first = Paul|last = Dourish|author-link = Paul Dourish|title = Where the action is|place = Cambridge, Massachusetts|publisher = [[MIT Press]]|edition = 1st|year = 2001|page = 245|isbn = 9780262541787 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These devices provide teachers and students access to the World Wide Web in addition to a variety of software applications.

==Technology education standards==

[[National Educational Technology Standards]] (NETS) served as a roadmap since 1998 for improved teaching and learning by [[educator]]s. As stated above, these standards are used by teachers, students, and administrators to measure competency and set higher goals to be skillful.

The Partnership for 21st Century Skills is a national organization that advocates for 21st century readiness for every student. Their most recent Technology Plan was released in 2010, "Transforming American Education: Learning Powered by Technology".&lt;ref name="edutopia.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edutopia.org/technology-integration-history|title=Technology Integration: A Short History|first=Suzie|last=Boss|date=8 September 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plan outlines a vision "to leverage the learning sciences and modern technology to create engaging, relevant, and personalized learning experiences for all learners that mirror students' daily lives and the reality of their futures. In contrast to traditional classroom instruction, this requires that students be put at the center and encouraged to take control of their own learning by providing flexibility on several dimensions."&lt;ref name="edutopia.org"/&gt;
Although tools have changed dramatically since the beginnings of educational technology, this vision of using technology for empowered, self-directed learning has remained consistent.&lt;ref name="edutopia.org"/&gt;

==Pedagogy==
The integration of electronic devices into classrooms has been cited as a possible solution to bridge access for students, to close achievement gaps, that are subject to the [[digital divide]], based on social class, economic inequality, or gender where and a potential user does not have enough cultural capital required to have access to information and communication technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first = David | last = Buckingham|title = Beyond technology|place = Cambridge, Massachusetts|publisher = [[Polity]]|year = 2007|page = 209|isbn = 9780745638812 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several motivations or arguments have been cited for integrating high-tech hardware and software into school, such as (1) making schools more efficient and productive than they currently are, (2) if this goal is achieved, teaching and learning will be transformed into an engaging and active process connected to real life, and (3) is to prepare the current generation of young people for the future workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first = Larry|last = Cuban|title = Oversold and underused|place = Cambridge, Massachusetts|publisher = [[Harvard University Press]]|year = 2003|page = 256|isbn = 9780674011090 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[computer]] has access to [[graphics]] and other functions students can use to express their creativity. Technology integration does not always have to do with the computer. It can be the use of the [[overhead projector]], student response clickers, etc. Enhancing how the student learns is very important in technology integration. Technology will always help students to learn and explore more.&lt;ref name="techparticipation.blogspot.in"/&gt;

=== Paradigms ===

Most research in technology integration has been criticized for being atheoretical and [[ad hoc]] driven more by the affordances of the technology rather than the demands of pedagogy and subject matter. Armstrong (2012) argued that multimedia transmission turns to limit the learning into simple content, because it is difficult to deliver complicated content through multimedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113 | title = Natural Learning in Higher Education| author = J. Scott Armstrong | journal = Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning | year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One approach that attempts to address this concern is a framework aimed at describing the nature of teacher knowledge for successful technology integration. The [[technological pedagogical content knowledge]] or TPACK framework has recently received some positive attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = TPACK.ORG|url = http://www.tpack.org|website = www.tpack.org|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another model that has been used to analyze tech integration is the [http://www.hippasus.com/rrpweblog/archives/2014/06/29/LearningTechnologySAMRModel.pdf SAMR framework], developed by Ruben Puentedura. This model attempts to measure the level of tech integration with 4 the levels that go from Enhancement to Transformation: Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, Redefinition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ruben R. Puentedura's Blog|url = http://hippasus.com/blog/|website = hippasus.com|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constructivism ===

[[Constructivism (learning theory)|Constructivism]] is a crucial component of technology integration.  It is a [[Constructivism (learning theory)|learning theory]] that describes the process of students constructing their own [[knowledge]] through collaboration and [[inquiry-based learning]]. According to this theory, students learn more deeply and retain information longer when they have a say in what and how they will learn. Inquiry-based learning, thus, is researching a question that is personally relevant and purposeful because of its direct correlation to the one investigating the knowledge.
As stated by [[Jean Piaget]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sk.com.br/sk-piage.html |author=Wanda Y. Ginn |title=JEAN PIAGET – INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT}}&lt;/ref&gt; constructivist learning is based on four stages of cognitive development. In these stages, children must take an active role in their own learning and produce meaningful works in order to develop a clear understanding. These works are a reflection of the knowledge that has been achieved through active self-guided learning. Students are active leaders in their learning and the learning is student-led rather than teacher–directed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://projects.coe.uga.edu/epltt/index.php?title=Piaget's_Stages |title=Piaget's Stages of Cognitive Development |publisher=Department of Educational Psychology and Instructional Technology, University of Georgia |author1=Kay C. Wood |author2=Harlan Smith |author3=Daurice Grossniklaus }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Many teachers use a constructivist approach in their classrooms assuming one or more of the following roles: facilitator, collaborator, curriculum developer, team member, community builder, educational leader, or information producer.

===Counter argument to computers in the classroom===

Is technology in the classroom needed, or does it hinder students' social development? We've all seen a table of teenagers on their phones, all texting, not really socializing or talking to each other. How do they develop social and communication skills? Neil Postman (1993) concludes: &lt;blockquote&gt;The role of the school is to help students learn how to ignore and discard information so that they can achieve a sense of coherence in their lives; to help students cultivate a sense of social responsibility; to help students think critically, historically, and humanely; to help students understand the ways in which technology shapes their consciousness; to help students learn that their own needs sometimes are subordinate to the needs of the group. I could go on for another three pages in this vein without any reference to how machinery can give students access to information. Instead, let me summarize in two ways what I mean. First, I'll cite a remark made repeatedly by my friend Alan Kay, who is sometimes called "the father of the personal computer." Alan likes to remind us that any problems the schools cannot solve without machines, they cannot solve with them. Second, and with this I shall come to a close: If a nuclear holocaust should occur some place in the world, it will not happen because of insufficient information; if children are starving in Somalia, it's not because of insufficient information; if crime terrorizes our cities, marriages are breaking up, mental disorders are increasing, and children are being abused, none of this happens because of a lack of information. These things happen because we lack something else. It is the "something else" that is now the business of schools.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, N. (1993). [http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/users/f/felwell/www/Theorists/Postman/Articles/TECHNOS_NET.htm Of Luddites, learning, and life]. Technos Quarterly, 2(4)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Tools==

===Interactive whiteboards===
[[Interactive whiteboard]]s are used in many schools as replacements for standard whiteboards and provide a way to allow students to interact with material on the computer. In addition, some interactive whiteboards software allow teachers to record their instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.neamb.com/professional-resources/benefits-of-interactive-whiteboards.htm|title=Interactive Whiteboards Enhance Classroom Instruction and Learning |agency= NEA Member Benefits |website= www.neamb.com|language=en |access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[virtual environment]]s are also used with interactive whiteboards as a way for students to interact with 3D [[virtual learning environment|virtual learning]] objects employing kinetics and [[haptic technology|haptic]] touch the classroom. An example of the use of this technique is the [[open-source]] project [[Edusim]].
*Research has been carried out{{Citation needed |date= August 2009}} to track the worldwide Interactive Whiteboard market by Decision Tree Consulting (DTC), a worldwide research company. According to the results, interactive Whiteboards continue to be the biggest technology revolution in classrooms, across the world there are over 1.2 million boards installed, over 5 million classrooms are forecast to have Interactive Whiteboards installed by 2011, Americas are the biggest region closely followed by [[Europe, the Middle East and Africa|EMEA]], and Mexico's [[Enciclomedia]] project to equip 145,000 classrooms is worth $1.8 billion and is the largest education technology project in the world.
*Interactive whiteboards can accommodate different learning styles, such as visual, tactile, and audio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meadonline.com/App/InteractiveWhiteboard/Classroom.pdf |author=Alfred N. Basilicato |title=Interactive Whiteboards: Assistive Technology for Every Classroom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interactive Whiteboards are another way that technology is expanding in schools. By assisting the teacher to helping students more kinestically as well as finding different ways to process there information throughout the entire classroom.

===Student response systems===
[[Student response systems]] consist of handheld remote control units, or response pads, which are operated by individual students. An infrared or radio frequency receiver attached to the teacher's computer collects the data submitted by students. The CPS (Classroom Performance System),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.einstruction.com/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=News.display&amp;Menu=newsroom&amp;content=FormalPaper&amp;id=209 |title=The Classroom Performance System: The Overwhelming Research Results Supporting This Teacher Tool and Methodology |work=eInstruction |accessdate=20 September 2009 |date=April 30, 2003|first=Darrel W. |last=Ward}}&lt;/ref&gt; once set, allows the  teacher to pose a question to students in several formats. Students then use the response pad to send their answer to the infrared sensor. Data collected from these systems is available to the teacher in real time and can be presented to the students in a graph form on an LCD projector. The teacher can also access a variety of reports to collect and analyze student data. These systems have been used in higher education science courses since the 1970s and have become popular in K-12 classrooms beginning in the early 21st century.

[[Audience response|Audience response systems]] (ARS) can help teachers analyze, and act upon student feedback more efficiently. For example, with polleverywhere.com, students text in answers via mobile devices to warm-up or quiz questions. The class can quickly view collective responses to the multiple-choice questions electronically, allowing the teacher to differentiate instruction and learn where students need help most.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edutopia.org/technology-integration-research-tools-programs|title=Technology Integration Research Review: Additional Tools and Programs|first=Vanessa|last=Vega|date=5 February 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combining ARS with peer learning via collaborative discussions has also been proven to be particularly effective. When students answer an in-class conceptual question individually, then discuss it with their neighbors, and then vote again on the same or a conceptually similar question, the percentage of correct student responses usually increases, even in groups where no student had given the correct answer previously.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Among other tools that have been noted as being effective as a way of technology integration are [[podcasts]], [[digital cameras]], [[smart phones]], [[Tablet computer|tablets]], [[digital media]], and [[blogs]].

==Mobile learning==
[[Mobile learning]] is defined as "learning across multiple contexts, through social and content interactions, using personal electronic devices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.co.in/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;rlz=1C1CHWA_enIN649IN649&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=mobile%20learning | title = Mobile learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A mobile device is essentially any device that is portable and has internet access and includes tablets, smart phones, cell phones, [[e-book reader]]s, and [[MP3 player]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edutopia.org/mobile-devices-learning-resource-guide?download=yes&amp;key=1364000111&amp;token=5c58fe7e330446f498435d5a11e1f125|title=Mobile Devices for Learning: What You Need to Know|work=Edutopia}}&lt;/ref&gt; As mobile devices become increasingly common personal devices of K-12 students, some educators seek to utilize downloadable applications and interactive games to help facilitate learning. This practice can be controversial because many parents and educators are concerned that students would be off-task because teachers cannot monitor their activity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; This is currently being troubleshooted by forms of mobile learning that require a log-in, acting as a way to track engagement of students.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===Benefits===
According to findings from four meta analyses, blending technology with face-to-face teacher time generally produces better outcomes than face-to-face or online learning alone. Research is currently limited on the specific features of technology integration that improve learning. Meanwhile, the marketplace of learning technologies continues to grow and vary widely in content, quality, implementation, and context of use.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Research shows that adding technology to K-12 environments, alone, does not necessarily improve learning. What matters most to implementing mobile learning is how students and teachers use technology to develop knowledge and skills and that requires training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edutopia.org/technology-integration-research-learning-outcomes|title=Technology Integration Research Review|author=Vega, Vanessa|date=February 5, 2013|work=Edutopia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Successful technology integration for learning goes hand in hand with changes in teacher training, curricula, and assessment practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23716387|title=Laptop programs for students|author1=Zucker, A.|author2=Light, D.|journal=Science|volume=323|issue=5910|pages=82–85|year=2009|doi=10.1126/science.1167705|pmid=19119224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of teacher professional development is profiled in Edutopia's Schools That Work series on eMints, a program that offers teachers 200 hours of coaching and training in technology integration over a two-year span.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|author=Markus, David|title=High-Impact Professional Development for Rural Schools|date=July 25, 2012|url=http://www.edutopia.org/blog/stw-tech-integration-professional-development|work=Edutopia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In these workshops teachers are trained in practices such as using interactive whiteboards and the latest web tools to facilitate active learning. In a 2010 publication of Learning Point Associates, statistics showed that students of teachers who had participated in eMints had significantly higher standardized test scores than those attained by their peers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

It can keep students focused for longer periods of time. The use of computers to look up information/ data is a tremendous time saver, especially when used to access a comprehensive resource like the Internet to conduct research. This time-saving aspect can keep students focused on a project much longer than they would with books and paper resources, and it helps them develop better learning through exploration and research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Huneycutt|first1=Timothy|title=Technology in the Classroom: the Benefits of Blended Learning|url=http://www.nms.org/Blog/TabId/58/PostId/188/technology-in-the-classroom-the-benefits-of-b|website=National Math + Science Initiative|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project-based activities==
Definition: Project Based Learning is a teaching method in which students gain knowledge and skills by working for an extended period of time to investigate and respond to an authentic, engaging and complex question, problem, or challenge.

Project Based Activities is a method of teaching where the students gain knowledge and skills by involving themselves for the more period of time to research and respond to the engaging and complex questions, problems, or challenges. the students will work in groups to solve the problems which are challenging.The students will work in groups to solve the problems which are challenging, real, curriculum based and frequently relating to more than one branch of knowledge. Therefore, a well designed project based learning activity is one which addresses different student learning styles and which does not assume that all students can demonstrate their knowledge in a single standard way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Project-Based Learning Activity About Project-Based Learning|url=http://www.sun-associates.com/lynn/pbl/pbl.html|work=resources.sun-associates.com|date=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements==
The project based learning activities involves four basic elements.
# An extended time frame.
# Collaboration.
# Inquiry, investigation and research.
# The construction of an artifact or performance of a consequential task.

==Examples of activities==

===CyberHunt===
The term "hunt" refers to finding or searching for something. "[[CyberHunt]]" means an online activity which learners use the internet as tool to find answers to the question's based upon the topics which are assigned by someone else. Hence learners also can design the CyberHunt on some specific topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is a Cyberhunt?|url=http://www.nmmu.ac.za/cyberhunts/whatisacyberhunt.htm|work=nmmu.ac.za}}&lt;/ref&gt; a CyberHunt, or internet scavenger hunt, is a [[project-based learning|project-based activity]] which helps students gain experience in exploring and browsing the [[internet]]. A CyberHunt may ask students to interact with the site (e.g.: play a game or watch a video), record short answers to teacher questions, as well as read and write about a topic in depth. There are basically two types of CyberHunt: 
*A simple task, in which the teacher develops a series of questions and gives the students a [[hypertext]] link to the URL that will give them the answer.
*A more complex task, intended for increasing and improving student internet search skills. Teachers ask questions for students to answer using a search engine.

===WebQuests===
It is an inquiry oriented activity in which most or all of the information used by the learners which are drawn out by the internet/web. It is designed to use  learner 'time well', to focus on using information rather than on looking for it and to support the learners to think at the level of analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. It is the wonderful way of capturing student's imagination and allowing them to explore in a guided, meaningful manner. It allow the students to explore issues and find their own answers.

There are six building blocks of webQuests:
# The introduction – capturing the student's interest.
# The task-describing the activities end product.
#The resources-web sites, students will use to complete the task.
# The evaluation-measuring the result of the activity.
# The conclusion-summing up of the activity.
[[WebQuest]]s are student-centered, web-based curricular units that are interactive and use Internet resources. The purpose of a webQuest is to use [[information]] on the [[World Wide Web|web]] to support the instruction taught in the classroom. A webQuest consists of an introduction, a task (or final project that students complete at the end of the webQuest), processes (or instructional activities), web-based resources, evaluation of learning, reflection about learning, and a conclusion.

=== WISE ===
The [[Web-based Inquiry Science Environment]] (WISE) provides a platform for creating inquiry science projects for middle school and high school students using evidence and resources from the Web. Funded by the [[U.S. National Science Foundation]], WISE has been developed at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] from 1996 until the present. WISE inquiry projects include diverse elements such as online discussions, data collection, drawing, argument creation, resource sharing, concept mapping and other built-in tools, as well as links to relevant web resources.It is the research-focused, open-source inquiry-based learning management system that includes the student- learning environment project authoring environment, grading tool, and tool and user/ course/ content management tools.

=== Virtual field trip ===
A [[virtual field trip]] is a website that allows the students to experience places, ideas, or objects beyond the constraints of the classroom{{Why|date=August 2009}}.
A virtual field trip is a great way to allow the students to explore and experience new information. This format is especially helpful and beneficial in allowing schools to keep the cost down. Virtual field trips may also be more practical for children in the younger grades, due to the fact that there is not a demand for chaperones and supervision. Although, a virtual field trip does not allow the children to have the hands on experiences and the social interactions that can and do take place on an actual field trip. An educator should incorporate the use of hands on material to further their understanding of the material that is presented and experienced in a virtual field trip.It is a guided exploration through the www that organizes a collection of pre- screened, its thematically based web pages into a structure online  learning experience

=== ePortfolio ===
An [[ePortfolio]] is a collection of student work that exhibits the student's achievements in one or more areas over time. Components in a typical student ePortfolio might contain creative writings, paintings, photography, math explorations, music, and videos. And it is a collection of work developed across varied contexts over time. The portfolio can advance learning by providing students and/or faculty with a way to organize, archive and display pieces of work.

[[Image:hidden-curriculum-cover.jpg|thumbnail|''The Hidden Curriculum'' (1973 edition)]]

'''''The Hidden Curriculum''''' (1970) is a book by the psychiatrist Benson R. Snyder,&lt;ref name="Snyder1971"&gt;{{cite book|author=Benson R. Snyder |title=The Hidden Curriculum |year=1971 |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |isbn=0-394-42842-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; the then-Dean of Institute Relations at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Benson Rowell Snyder, former psychiatrist-in-chief at MIT, dies at 89 |url=http://news.mit.edu/2012/obit-snyder |newspaper=MIT News |date=September 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Snyder advances a thesis that much of campus conflict and students' personal anxiety is caused by unstated academic and social norms. These hidden norms affect the ability to develop independently or think creatively, and form what Snyder calls the [[hidden curriculum]].  He illustrates his thesis with psychological studies and other research conducted at MIT and [[Wellesley College]].

==Summary==
The phrase "hidden curriculum" was coined by Philip Jackson in his 1968 book entitled ''Life in Classrooms'', in a section about the need for students to master the institutional expectations of school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Philip Wesley Jackson |title=Life in Classrooms |date=1968 |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston}} Reprinted as {{cite book |author=Philip Wesley Jackson |title=Life in Classrooms |year=1990|publisher=Teachers College Press |isbn=978-0-8077-7005-4 |pages=33–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snyder develops this with observations of particular institutions.&lt;ref name=ISSTL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doceo.co.uk/tools/hidden.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170414182209/http://www.doceo.co.uk/tools/hidden.htm |archivedate=2017-04-14 |df= }} Sending Messages:
Managing the Hidden Curriculum; second conference of the International Society for the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (Vancouver B.C., 14–16 October 2005) "For our purposes in higher education, therefore, let us set aside most of the above line of debate, and start with Snyder (1971). Snyder's observations pre-figured all the later research on "Deep" and "Surface" learning; he noted that at MIT in the 'fifties and 'sixties, the curriculum was getting more and more crowded as technological knowledge grew, and so undergraduates were taking "short cuts" in their learning. They could not absorb everything, so they strategically tried to guess what would be assessed, for example, and revised only that. Snyder's additional insight, however, was to realise that unintentionally the Institute was teaching them to act strategically, hence the term "hidden curriculum".''

Even honest efforts to enrich curricula frequently fail, says Snyder, thanks to the importance of the tacit and unwritten understanding.  He says that while some students do not realize there is a disjunction between the two curricula, in a demanding environment, students develop strategies to cope with the requirements they face.&lt;ref name = ISSTL /&gt;

Many students find they can not possibly complete all the work assigned them; they learn to neglect some of it. Some student groups maintain files of past examinations which only worsen this situation.&lt;ref name = ISSTL /&gt;

The difference between the formal and real requirements produced considerable dissonance among the students and resulted in cynicism, scorn, and hypocrisy among students, and particular difficulty for minority students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Hafferty |editor-first1=Frederick W. |editor-last2=O'Donnell |editor-first2=Joseph F.  |title=The Hidden Curriculum in Health Professional Education |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tSXZBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11 |accessdate=November 1, 2016 |year=2015 |publisher=Dartmouth |isbn=978-1611686609 |page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No part of the university community, writes Snyder, neither the professors, the administration nor the students, desires the end result created by this process.&lt;ref name = ISSTL /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2699">'''The Philadelphia Center''' (TPC) is a 16-week off-campus undergraduate program in [[Philadelphia]] that is based on a model of experiential education.

TPC was founded in 1967 under the auspices of the [[Great Lakes Colleges Association]] (G.L.C.A.).   Since then, over 7,500 students from 90 colleges and 50 countries have attended the program. Participants in TPC earn [[academic credit]] while interning 32 hours a week, taking seminars, and living independently in an urban setting. TPC is managed by [[Albion College]], in [[Albion, Michigan]].

TPC students spend their first two weeks in orientation, which includes an introduction to the city and a guided housing search.  The TPC orientation period also contains an introduction to the Placement Process; students search TPC's database for potential internship placements and are required to go on at least three interviews.

TPC Participants live independently with other students in apartments or houses they choose during the orientation period. TPC Staff help students investigate living arrangements, communicate with property owners, understand what to look for in an apartment, and review and sign a lease.

Once a student is housed and placed in an internship, they work four days a week (32 hours) and attend their City Seminar on one day. Students of all majors get an opportunity to explore urban issues and define their own personal and professional goals through hands-on experience. The multidisciplinary focus of TPC combines [[internship]] opportunities, academic seminars, and urban living experiences in order to help undergraduate students make decisions about life after graduation.

The TPC Mission Statement states it "puts into practice the liberal arts mission by integrating multidisciplinary seminars, comprehensive advising, and substantial internship opportunities in the context of an urban environment. This approach engages participants in critical investigations of their own abilities, objectives, and values and directs them to do meaningful, productive, and transformative work, fostering a desire for lifelong learning and helping students discover their personal and professional direction in life."

'''Transdisciplinarity''' connotes a research strategy that crosses many [[Discipline (academia)|disciplinary]] boundaries to create a [[Holism|holistic]] approach. It applies to research efforts focused on problems that cross the boundaries of two or more disciplines, such as research on effective [[information system]]s for [[biomedical research]] (see [[bioinformatics]]), and can refer to concepts or methods that were originally developed by one discipline, but are now used by several others, such as [[ethnography]], a field research method originally developed in [[anthropology]] but now widely used by other disciplines.
The Belmont Forum &lt;ref&gt;http://www.belmontforum.org&lt;/ref&gt; elaborated that a transdisciplinary approach is enabling inputs and scoping across scientific and non-scientific stakeholder communities and facilitating a systemic way of addressing a challenge. This includes initiatives that support the capacity building required for the successful transdisciplinary formulation and implementation of research actions.

==Usage==
Transdisciplinarity has two common meanings:

===German usage===
In German-speaking countries, ''Transdisziplinarität'' refers to the integration of diverse forms of research, and includes specific methods for relating knowledge in problem-solving.&lt;ref&gt;Mittelstrass 2003&lt;/ref&gt; A 2003 conference held at the [[University of Göttingen]] showcased the diverse meanings of multi-, inter- and transdisciplinarity and made suggestions for converging them without eliminating present usages.&lt;ref&gt;Brand/Schaller/Völker 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

When the very nature of a problem is under dispute, transdisciplinarity can help determine the most relevant problems and research questions involved.&lt;ref&gt;(Funtowicz &amp; Ravetz 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; A first type of question concerns the cause of the present problems and their future development (system knowledge). Another concerns which values and norms can be used to form goals of the problem-solving process (target knowledge). A third relates to how a problematic situation can be transformed and improved (transformation knowledge). Transdisciplinarity requires adequate addressing of the complexity of problems and the diversity of perceptions of them, that abstract and case-specific knowledge are linked, and that practices promote the common good.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch Hadorn et al. 2008, Jaeger &amp; Scheringer 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Transdisciplinarity arises when participating experts interact in an open discussion and dialogue, giving equal weight to each perspective and relating them to each other. This is difficult because of the overwhelming amount of information involved, and because of incommensurability of specialized languages in each field of expertise. To excel under these conditions, researchers need not only in-depth knowledge and know-how of the disciplines involved, but skills in moderation, mediation, association and transfer.

===Wider usage===
Transdisciplinarity is also used to signify a unity of knowledge beyond disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolescu 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Piaget]] introduced this usage of the term in 1970, and in 1987, the International Center for Transdisciplinary Research (CIRET) adopted the Charter of Transdisciplinarity&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inters.org/Freitas-Morin-Nicolescu-Transdisciplinarity Charter of Transdisciplinarity]&lt;/ref&gt; at the 1st World Congress of Transdisciplinarity, Convento da Arrabida, Portugal, November 1994.

In the CIRET approach, transdisciplinarity is radically distinct from [[interdisciplinarity]]. Interdisciplinarity, like pluridisciplinarity, concerns the transfer of methods from one discipline to another, allowing research to spill over disciplinary boundaries, but staying within the framework of disciplinary research.

As the prefix "trans" indicates, transdisciplinarity concerns that which is at once between the disciplines, across the different disciplines, and beyond each individual discipline. Its goal is the understanding of the present world, of which one of the imperatives is the overarching unity of knowledge.

Another critical defining characteristic of transdisciplinary research is the inclusion of stakeholders in defining research objectives and strategies in order to better incorporate the diffusion of learning produced by the research. Collaboration between stakeholders is deemed essential&amp;nbsp;– not merely at an academic or disciplinary collaboration level, but through active collaboration with people affected by the research and community-based stakeholders. In such a way, transdisciplinary collaboration becomes uniquely capable of engaging with different ways of knowing the world, generating new knowledge, and helping stakeholders understand and incorporate the results or lessons learned by the research.&lt;ref&gt;Wickson, F., Carew, A.L. &amp; Russell, A.W. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Transdisciplinarity is defined by [[Basarab Nicolescu]] through three methodological postulates: the existence of levels of Reality, the logic of the included middle, and complexity.&lt;ref&gt;Transdisciplinarity&amp;nbsp;– Theory and Practice (Ed.), Hampton Press, Cresskill, NJ, USA, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the presence of several levels of Reality the space between disciplines and beyond disciplines is full of information. Disciplinary research concerns, at most, one and the same level of Reality ; moreover, in most cases, it only concerns fragments of one level of Reality. On the contrary, transdisciplinarity concerns the dynamics engendered by the action of several levels of Reality at once. The discovery of these dynamics necessarily passes through disciplinary knowledge. While not a new discipline or a new superdiscipline, transdisciplinarity is nourished by disciplinary research; in turn, disciplinary research is clarified by transdisciplinary knowledge in a new, fertile way. In this sense, disciplinary and transdisciplinary research are not antagonistic but complementary. As in the case of disciplinarity, transdisciplinary research is not antagonistic but complementary to multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity research.

According to Nicolescu, transdisciplinarity is nevertheless radically distinct from multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity because of its goal, the understanding of the present world, which cannot be accomplished in the framework of disciplinary research.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} The goal of multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity always remains within the framework of disciplinary research. If transdisciplinarity is often confused with interdisciplinarity or multidisciplinarity (and by the same token, we note that interdisciplinarity is often confused with multidisciplinarity) this is explained in large part by the fact that all three overflow disciplinary boundaries. Advocates maintain this confusion hides the huge potential of transdisciplinarity.&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2010). Theme-based research in the transdisciplinary field of educational linguistics. In F.M. Hult (Ed.), ''Directions and prospects for educational linguistics'' (pp. 19-32). New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, transdisciplinarity is a consolidated academic field that is giving rise to new applied researches, especially in [[Latin America]] and the Caribbean. In this sense, the [[transdisciplinary]] and [[biomimetics]] research of Javier Collado &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coevolution in the Big History - a transdisciplinary and biomimetic introduction to the Sustainable Development Goals |first=Javier |last=Collado-Ruano |url=http://www.globaleducationmagazine.com/tesis-doctoral-Javier-Collado-Ruano-Coevoluci%C3%B3n-en-la-Gran-Historia.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Big History]] represents an ecology of knowledge between scientific knowledge and the ancestral wisdom of [[native peoples]], such as [[Indigenous peoples in Ecuador]]. According to Collado,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bioethics as a transdisciplinary science of complexity: a coevolutive introduction from the Big History |first=Javier |last=Collado-Ruano |page=56 |url=http://www.redalyc.org/html/1892/189246655004/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the transdisciplinary methodology applied in the field of [[Big History]] seeks to understand the interconnections of the human race with the different levels of reality that co-exist in nature and in the cosmos, and this includes mystical and spiritual experiences, very present in the rituals of [[shamanism]] with [[ayahuasca]] and other sacred plants. In abstract, the teaching of [[Big History]] in universities of [[Brazil]], [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], and [[Argentina]] implies a transdisciplinary vision that integrates and unifies diverse epistemes that are in, between, and beyond the scientific disciplines, that is, including ancestral wisdom, [[spirituality]], [[art]], emotions, mystical experiences and other dimensions forgotten in the [[history of science]], specially by the positivist approach.

==Arts and humanities==
Transdisciplinarity can be found in the arts and humanities. For example, the [[Planetary Collegium]] seeks "the development of transdisciplinary discourse in the convergence of art, science, technology and consciousness research." The [http://www.plasticites-sciences-arts.org/plasticities-sciences-arts/ Plasticities Sciences Arts] (PSA) research group also develops transdisiciplinary approaches regarding humanities and fundamental sciences relationships as well as the Art &amp; Science field.

==Global education==
Transdisciplinarity can be also found in Global Education. For example, [[Global Education Magazine]], an international journal supported by [[UNESCO]] and [[UNHCR]]:
"transdisciplinarity represents the capable germ to promote an endogenous development of the evolutionary spirit of internal critical consciousness, where religion and science are complementary. Respect, solidarity and cooperation should be global standards for the entire human development with no boundaries. This requires a radical change in the ontological models of sustainable development, global education and world-society. We must rely on the recognition of a plurality of models, cultures and socio-economical diversification. As well as biodiversity is the way for the emergence of new species, cultural diversity represents the creative potential of world-society." &lt;ref&gt;Transdisciplinary Education as Ethic of the Diversity Reform in the World-Society of the 21st Century, article published by Javier Collado on June 20th: World Refugee Day in Global Education Magazine, {{ISSN|2255-033X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human sciences==
The range of transdisciplinarity becomes clear when the four central questions of biological research ((1) ''[[Causality|causation]]'', (2) ''[[ontogeny]],'' (3) [[adaptation]], (4) [[phylogeny]] [after [[Niko Tinbergen]] 1963, see also [[Tinbergen's four questions]], cf. [[Aristotle]]: Causality / Four Major Causes]) are graphed against distinct levels of analysis (e.g. [[cell (biology)|cell]], [[organ (anatomy)|organ]], ''[[individual]], [[Group (sociology)|group]]''; [cf. "Laws about the Levels of Complexity" of [[Nicolai Hartmann]] 1940/1964, see also [[Rupert Riedl]] 1984]):&lt;ref&gt;Excerpt from Medicus 2005, with the authors permission&lt;/ref&gt;

In this "scheme of transdisciplinarity", all anthropological disciplines (paragraph C in the table of the pdf-file below), their questions (paragraph A: see pdf-file) and results (paragraph B: see pdf-file) can be intertwined and allocated with each other for examples how these aspects go into those little boxes in the matrix, see e.g. the table {{cite web|title=The Framework of Anthropological Research|url=http://homepage.uibk.ac.at/~c720126/humanethologie/ws/medicus/block1/4BQ_E.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707071403/http://homepage.uibk.ac.at/~c720126/humanethologie/ws/medicus/block1/4BQ_E.pdf|archivedate=2014-07-07|df=}} This chart includes all realms of anthropological research (no one is excluded). It is the starting point for a systematical order for all human sciences, and also a source for a consistent networking and structuring of their results. This "bio-psycho-social" orientation framework is the basis for the development of the "Fundamental Theory of Human Sciences" and for a transdisciplinary consensus. (In this tabulated orientation matrix the questions and reference levels in ''italics'' are also the subject of the humanities.). Niko Tinbergen was familiar with both conceptual categories (i.e. the four central questions of biological research and the levels of analysis), the tabulation was made by [[Gerhard Medicus]]. Certainly, a humanist perspective always involves a transdisciplinary focus. A good and classic example of mixing very different sciences was the work developed by Leibniz in seventeenth-eighteenth centuries in order to create a universal system of justice.&lt;ref&gt;See José Andrés-Gallego, 42. "Are Humanism and Mixed Methods Related? Leibniz's Universal (Chinese) Dream": Journal of Mixed Methods Research, 29(2) (2015): 118-132: http://mmr.sagepub.com/content/9/2/118.abstract.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==

Nationally syndicated columnist [[Kathleen Parker]] wrote that ''What Will They Learn?'' is a guide that can "help parents and students determine where they might get the best bang for their buck." The study has been featured in the ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'', the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', and newspapers across the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=parker/&gt;&lt;ref name=mcgurn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatwilltheylearn.com/news|title=In The News|publisher=[[American Council of Trustees and Alumni]]|accessdate=June 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the report's release in 2009, the founder of ''[[US News and World Report]]'', Mel Elfin, reassured ACTA that the anger of some of the higher education establishment "is probably a sign that you are on the right track [to reform]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://centerforcollegeaffordability.org/archives/1120|title=What Will They Learn?|publisher=Center for College Affordability and Productivity|date=August 19, 2009|accessdate=June 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the strong performance of [[historically black colleges and universities]], [[Michael Lomax]], president of the [[United Negro College Fund]], said "the ACTA review’s finding that historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) ‘demonstrate overall stronger general education requirements than other public and private institutions’ confirms the important role these universities continue to play in American higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In 2009, Debra Humphreys, vice president for communications and public affairs at the [[Association of American Colleges and Universities]], said, "as is often the case with [[American Council of Trustees and Alumni|ACTA]], they have posed some very good questions," but Humphreys criticized the study for being narrow in scope and called its methodology "inadequate."&lt;ref name=glenn/&gt;

ACTA countered that claim by commissioning a Roper study in 2011. The study found that 70 percent of Americans agreed with ACTA that all students should be required to take core curriculum classes. That number jumped to 80 percent among 25- to 34-year-olds who, according to the survey, are those "just out of college who may find learnings from such classes are helpful in the job
market."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

| title=Roper Study Findings
| publisher=[[American Council of Trustees and Alumni]]|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Murray Sperber]] of [[Indiana University]] said the report "documents higher education's dirty little secret: Schools are charging more each year and requiring many fewer traditional education courses. This results in a legion of students with spotty educations and meaningless degrees."&lt;ref name=glenn/&gt;
