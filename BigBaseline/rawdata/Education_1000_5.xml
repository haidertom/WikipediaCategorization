'''Academic dishonesty''', '''academic misconduct,''' '''academic fraud''' and [[academic integrity]] are related concepts that refer to various actions on the part of students that go against the expected norms of a school, university or other learning institution. Definitions of academic misconduct are usually outlined in institutional policies.&lt;ref&gt;Bretag, T., Mahmud, S., Wallace, M., Walker, R., James, C., Green, M., . . . Partridge, L. (2011). Core elements of exemplary academic integrity policy in Australian higher education. ''International Journal for Educational Integrity, 7''(2), 3-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bretag, T., Mahmud, S., East, J., Green, M., &amp; James, C. (2011). ''Academic integrity standards: A preliminary analysis of the Academic integrity policies at Australian Universities''. Paper presented at the Proceedings of AuQF 2011 Demonstrating Quality, Melbourne.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eaton|first=Sarah Elaine|date=2017-01-17|title=Comparative Analysis of Institutional Policy Definitions of Plagiarism: A Pan-Canadian University Study|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10780-017-9300-7|journal=Interchange|language=en|volume=48|issue=3|pages=271–281|doi=10.1007/s10780-017-9300-7|issn=0826-4805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of academic dishonest include:

*'''[[Plagiarism]]''': The adoption or reproduction of original creations of another author (person, collective, organization, community or other type of author, including anonymous authors) without due acknowledgment.
*'''[[Fabrication (science)|Fabrication]]''': The falsification of data, information, or [[citation]]s in any formal academic exercise.
*'''[[Deception]]''': Providing false information to an instructor concerning a formal academic exercise—''e.g.,'' giving a false excuse for missing a deadline or falsely claiming to have submitted work.
*'''[[Cheating#Academic|Cheating]]''': Any attempt to obtain assistance in a formal academic exercise (like an [[Test (assessment)|examination]]) without due acknowledgment (including the use of [[cheat sheet]]s).
*'''[[Bribery]]''' or paid services: Giving assignment answers or test answers for money.
*'''[[Sabotage]]''': Acting to prevent others from completing their work. This includes cutting pages out of library books or willfully disrupting the experiments of others.
*'''[[Academic dishonesty#Professorial misconduct|Professorial misconduct]]''': [[Professor]]ial acts that are academically fraudulent equate to academic fraud and/or grade fraud.
*'''[[Impersonation]]''': assuming a student's identity with intent to provide an advantage for the student, such as sitting an exam on behalf of that student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Taught Postgraduate Framework (Part B - Doctorate Level) |url=http://www.qmu.ac.uk/quality/documents/prof_doc_regs_june08.doc |date=June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518120810/http://qmu.ac.uk/quality/documents/prof_doc_regs_june08.doc |archivedate=2012-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Academic misconduct |date=May 8, 2015 |url=http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/academic-services/students/postgraduate-taught/discipline/academic-misconduct |work=University of Edinburgh |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100916220010/http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/academic-services/students/postgraduate-taught/discipline/academic-misconduct |archivedate=September 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Academic conduct in assessment|url=http://micn.otago.ac.nz/current-students/assessment/assessment-procedures-guide-web-version/11-conduct|work=University of Otago|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210220152/http://micn.otago.ac.nz/current-students/assessment/assessment-procedures-guide-web-version/11-conduct|archivedate=February 10, 2013|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plagiarism|work=University of Sussex|url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/academicoffice/1-4-1.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051203185811/http://www.sussex.ac.uk/academicoffice/1-4-1.html|archivedate=December 3, 2005|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Contract cheating]]''': A form of cheating in which students hire a third party to complete work on their behalf.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, R., &amp; Lancaster, T. (2006). ''Eliminating the successor to plagiarism: Identifying the usage of contract cheating sites''.

Academic dishonesty has been documented in every type of educational setting from [[elementary school]] to [[graduate school]]. Throughout history this type of dishonesty has been met with varying degrees of approbation.

==History==
[[File:Prüfungszellen-Nanking.jpg|thumb|Chinese Examination Cells at the South River School (Nanjiangxue) Nanjing (China). This structure prevents cheating in exams.]]
In antiquity, the notion of [[intellectual property]] was thought of differently than it is today. Ideas were the common property of the [[literate elite]]. Books were published by hand-copying them. Scholars shared digests or commentaries on other works, which could contain as much or as little original material as the author desired. There was no standard system of citation at this time. Scholars were an elite and small group who knew and generally trusted each other. This system continued through the European Middle Ages. Education was in [[Latin]] and occasionally [[Greek language|Greek]]. Some scholars were [[monk]]s, who used much of their time copying [[manuscript]]s. Other scholars were in urban [[universities]] connected to the [[Catholic Church]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Academic dishonesty dates back to the first tests.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Lang, J. M. (2013). ''Cheating lessons: Learning from academic dishonesty''. Harvard, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars note that cheating was prevalent on the [[Chinese civil service]] exams thousands of years ago, even when cheating carried the penalty of death for both examinee and examiner.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name = bushway623&gt;Ann Bushway and William R. Nash, "School Cheating Behavior", ''Review of Educational Research'' 47, no. 4 (Autumn 1977), 623.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bribery of examiners was also common, as represented in works such as the Ming-dynasty story collection ''[https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-book-of-swindles/9780231178631 The Book of Swindles]''&lt;ref&gt;"Type 20: Corruption in Education," in Zhang Yingyu, ''The Book of Swindles: Selections from a Late Ming Collection'', translated by Christopher Rea and Bruce Rusk (New York, NY: Columbia University Press, 2017), pp. 142-163.&lt;/ref&gt; and Qing-dynasty novel ''[[Rulin waishi]]'' [The Unofficial History of the Scholars].

Standards for citation and referencing began at the end of the 19th century with the emergence of guidance provided by scholarly societies that developed discipline-specific expectations for referencing such as the [[Modern Language Association|MLA]] and the [[American Psychological Association|APA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Sue Carter Simmons|contribution=Competing Notions of Authorship: A Historical Look at Students and Textbooks on Plagiarism and Cheating|title=Perspectives on Plagiarism and Intellectual Property in the Postmodern World|editors=Lise Buranen, Alice M. Roy|location=Albany|publisher=State University of New York Press|date=April 23, 1999|page=42|isbn=978-0791440803}}&lt;/ref&gt; About the same time, scholars began researching issues related to cheating, with some early research dating back to the late 19th century&lt;ref&gt;Gallwey, T. (1879). Plagiarism or coincidence: Which? ''The Irish Monthly, 7'', 312-319.&lt;/ref&gt; and early 20th centuries, when cheating was identified as a widespread problem at college campuses in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Bird, C. (1929). An improved method of detecting cheating in objective examinations. ''The Journal of Educational Research, 19''(5), 341-348.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sue Carter Simmons, "Competing Notions of Authorship: A Historical Look at Students and Textbooks on Plagiarism and Cheating", in ''Perspectives on Plagiarism and Intellectual Property in the Postmodern World'' ed. Lise Buranen and Alice M. Roy (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1999), 45&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been estimated that as many as two-thirds of students cheated at some point of their college careers at the turn of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jason M. Stephens|url=http://www.academicintegrity.org/cai_research/templeton_stephens.php|title=Psychology Through Ecology: Academic Motivation, Moral Aptitudes, and Cheating Behavior in Middle and High School Settings|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411054802/http://www.academicintegrity.org/cai_research/templeton_stephens.php|archivedate= April 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sorority|Fraternities]] often operated so-called [[essay bank]]s, where term papers were kept on file and could be resubmitted over and over again by different students, often with the only change being the name on the paper.&lt;ref&gt;Stavisky, Leonard Price (1973). "Term Paper 'Mills', Academic Plagiarism, and State Regulation". Political Science Quarterly: 445–461.&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of academic dishonesty became more prominent in the latter half of the twentieth century, as universities shifted towards more democratic approaches to admission.

==Today==
Academic dishonesty does not have a universal definition.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Educational institutions in different regions understand and act on academic dishonestly in different ways. Below are some examples of specific contexts.

=== United States ===
In the United States, one study has shown that 20% of students started cheating in the first grade.&lt;ref name = bushway623/&gt;  Similarly, other studies reveal that currently in the U.S., 56% of [[middle school]] students and 70% of [[high school]] students have cheated.&lt;ref&gt;Wilfried Decoo, ''Crisis on Campus: Confronting Academic Misconduct'' (Cambridge, Mass.: [[MIT Press]], 2002), 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  A large-scale study in Germany found that 75% of the university students admitted that they conducted at least one of seven types of academic misconduct (such as plagiarism or falsifying data) within the previous six months.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Patrzek | first1 = J. | last2 = Sattler | first2 = S. | last3 = van Veen | first3 = F. | last4 = Grunschel | first4 = C. | last5 = Fries | first5 = S. | year = 2014 | title = Investigating the effect of academic procrastination on the frequency and variety of academic misconduct: a panel study | url = | journal = Studies in Higher Education | volume = | issue = | pages = 1–16| doi = 10.1080/03075079.2013.854765 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students are not the only ones to cheat in an academic setting. A study among North Carolina school teachers found that some 35% of respondents said they had witnessed their colleagues cheating in one form or another. The rise of [[high-stakes testing]] and the consequences of the results on the teacher is cited as a reason why a teacher might want to inflate the results of their students.&lt;ref name="Jacob-Levitt-2003"&gt;Brian Aaron Jacob &amp; Steven D. Levitt (2003) ''Catching Cheating Teachers: The Results of an Unusual Experiment in Implementing Theory", available at [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/brookings-wharton_papers_on_urban_affairs/v2003/2003.1jacob02.pdf Project Muse].&lt;/ref&gt;

The first scholarly studies in the 1960s of academic dishonesty in [[higher education]] found that nationally in the U.S., somewhere between 50–70% of college students had cheated at least once.&lt;ref name= bowers155&gt;William J. Bowers, ''Student Dishonesty and its Control in Colleges'' (New York: Bureau of Applied Social Research, [[Columbia University]], 1964), 155.&lt;/ref&gt;  While nationally, these rates of cheating in the U.S. remain stable today, there are large disparities between different schools, depending on the size, selectivity, and anti-cheating policies of the school. Generally, the smaller and more selective the college, the less cheating occurs there. For instance, the number of students who have engaged in academic dishonesty at small elite [[liberal arts colleges]] can be as low as 15–20%, while cheating at large [[public university|public universities]] can be as high as 75%.&lt;ref name = labeff192&gt;Emily E. LaBeff, et al., "Situational Ethics and College Student Cheating", ''Sociological Inquiry'' 60, no. 2 (May 1990), 192.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, researchers have found that students who attend a school with an [[honor code]] are less likely to cheat than students at schools with other ways of enforcing [[academic integrity]].&lt;ref name=mccabetrevino_honorcode_532&gt;Donald L. McCabe and Linda Klebe Trevino, "Academic Dishonesty: Honor Codes and Other Contextual Influences", ''The Journal of Higher Education'' 64, no. 5, (September–October 1993), 532.&lt;/ref&gt; As for graduate education, a recent study found that 56% of MBA students admitted cheating, along with 54% of graduate students in engineering, 48% in education, and 45% in law.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Pope, 'Higher education sees rise in dishonesty', [[Associated Press]], May 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheating in high schools is growing in the United States at an exponential rate. There is also a great difference in students' perceptions and the reality of their own ethical behavior. In a 2008 survey of 30,000 students in high school carried out by the Josephson Institute for Youth Ethics, 62 percent of students polled said they "copied another's homework two or more times in the past year."&lt;ref name="Josephson Institute"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ethics of American Youth: 2008|url=http://charactercounts.org/pdf/reportcard/2008/Q_all.pdf|work=Report Card on the Ethics of American Youth|publisher=Josephson Institute|accessdate=14 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616061145/http://charactercounts.org/pdf/reportcard/2008/Q_all.pdf|archive-date=16 June 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet, on the same survey, 92 percent said they were "satisfied with their personal ethics and character."&lt;ref name="Josephson Institute" /&gt;  Hence, there is generally a discrepancy between actual behavior and self-image of high school students' character.

As more students take courses and assessments online, there is a persistent perception that it is easier to cheat in an online class than a face-to-face course.&lt;ref name="West Georgia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cheating in the Digital Age: Do Students Cheat More in Online Courses?|url=http://www.westga.edu/~distance/ojdla/spring131/watson131.html|work=Cheating in the Digital Age|publisher=University of West Georgia|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, there are online services that offer to prepare any kind of homework of high school and college level and take online tests for students.&lt;ref name="ohiomatyc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cheating goes high tech |last=Maclean |first=Phil |url=http://www.ohiomatyc.org/web_documents/newsletter_fall_09.pdf |newspaper=Ohiomatyc News |date=Fall 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110202253/http://www.ohiomatyc.org/web_documents/newsletter_fall_09.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While administrators are often aware of such websites, they have been unsuccessful in curbing cheating in homework and non-proctored online tests, resorting to a recommendation by the Ohio Mathematics Association to derive at least 80% of the grade of online classes from proctored tests.&lt;ref name="ohiomatyc"/&gt; In addition, colleges and universities are increasingly turning to online proctoring services to oversee tens of thousands of exams per year.&lt;ref name="Inside Higher Ed"&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Proctoring Catches Cheaters; Raises Concerns|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/article/2017/05/10/online-exam-proctoring-catches-cheaters-raises-concerns|work=Online Proctoring|publisher=Inside Higher Ed|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While research on academic dishonesty in other countries is less extensive, anecdotal evidence suggests cheating could be even more common in countries like Japan &lt;ref&gt;L.M. Dryden, "A Distant Mirror or Through the Looking Glass?: Plagiarism and Intellectual Property in Japanese Education", in ''Perspectives on Plagiarism and Intellectual Property in the Postmodern World,'' ed. Lise Buranen and Alice M. Roy (Albany: [[SUNY Press]], 1999), 75.&lt;/ref&gt; and Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/doaj/23507756/2015/00000003/00000002/art00010&lt;/ref&gt;

A typology of academic misconduct has been devised by Perry (2010).&lt;ref name="eprints.hud.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/10515/1/IrelandPlagiarismpdf.pdf|title= Plagiarism: Let's start as we don't mean to go on|author=Ireland, Chris|author2= English, John|date=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perry's typology presents a two dimensional model of academic misconduct with one dimension measuring the degree to which rules are understood and the other dimension measuring how closely these rules are followed.&lt;ref name="eprints.hud.ac.uk"/&gt; According to the typology only those students who understand the rules but fail to adhere to the rules are classified as 'cheats'.&lt;ref name="eprints.hud.ac.uk"/&gt;

=== Australia ===
In Australia, academic dishonesty is addressed by the [https://www.teqsa.gov.au/ Tertiary Education Quality Standards Agency],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Bretag|first = T|date =4 October 2017|website = Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency|title = Good Practice Note: Addressing contract cheating to safeguard academic integrity |url = https://www.teqsa.gov.au/latest-news/publications/good-practice-note-addressing-contract-cheating-safeguard-academic}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a government agency.

=== UK ===
In the UK, the Quality Assurance Agency is responsible for quality assurance in higher education. It has produced several policy and guidance documents for policy makers, educators and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (UK) (QAA)|date = 2016|title = Plagiarism in higher education - Custom essay writing services: an exploration and next steps for the UK higher education sector |url = https://www.qaa.ac.uk/docs/qaa/quality-code/plagiarism-in-higher-education-2016.pdf?sfvrsn=308cfe81_2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (UK) (QAA)|date = October 2017|title=Contracting to cheat in higher education: How to address contract cheating, the use of third-party services and essay mills |url = https://www.qaa.ac.uk/docs/qaa/quality-code/contracting-to-cheat-in-higher-education.pdf?sfvrsn=f66af681_8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
In Canada, academic misconduct is handled by individual post-secondary institutions,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, P. D. (2014).

==Types==

=== Bribery ===
{{Main|Bribery}}
'''Bribery''' is an act of giving money or gift giving that alters the behavior of the recipient. Bribery constitutes a crime and is defined by ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' as the [[Offer and acceptance|offering]], [[wikt:giving|giving]], [[Offer and acceptance|receiving]], or [[Solicitation|soliciting]] of any item of value to influence the actions of an official or other person in charge of a public or [[legal]] [[duty]].

The bribe is the gift bestowed to influence the recipient's conduct. It may be any [[money]], [[Good (economics)|good]], [[Chose (English law)|right in action]], [[property]], [[Promotion (rank)|preferment]], [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]], [[Remuneration|emolument]], object of value, advantage, or merely a promise or undertaking to induce or influence the action, vote, or influence of a person in an official or public capacity.&lt;ref&gt;See generally T. Markus Funk, [http://www.perkinscoie.com/Dont-Pay-for-the-Misdeeds-of-Others-Avoiding-Foreign-Third-Party-FCPA-Liability-01-05-2011 "Don't Pay for the Misdeeds of Others:  Intro to Avoiding Third-Party FCPA Liability," 6 BNA White Collar Crime Report 33 (January 14, 2011)] (discussing bribery in the context of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cheating===
{{Main|Cheating}}
[[Image:Cheating.JPG|right|thumb|Using [[cheat sheet|crib notes]] during an examination without prior permission from the instructor is cheating]]
Cheating can take the form of crib notes, looking over someone's shoulder during an exam, or any forbidden sharing of information between students regarding an exam or exercise. Many elaborate methods of cheating have been developed over the years. For instance, students have been documented hiding notes in the bathroom toilet tank, in the brims of their baseball caps, up their sleeves, along their thighs or in their cleavage. Also, the storing of information in graphing calculators, pagers, cell phones, and other electronic devices has cropped up since the information revolution began. While students have long surreptitiously scanned the tests of those seated near them, some students actively try to aid those who are trying to cheat. Methods of secretly signalling the right answer to friends are quite varied, ranging from coded sneezes or pencil tapping to high-pitched noises beyond the hearing range of most teachers. Some students have been known to use more elaborate means, such as using a system of repetitive body signals like hand movements or foot jerking to distribute answers (i.e. where a tap of the foot could correspond to answer "A", two taps for answer "B", and so on).{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Cheating differs from most other forms of academic dishonesty, in that people can engage in it without benefiting themselves academically at all. For example, a student who illicitly [[telegraphed]] answers to a friend during a test would be cheating, even though the student's own work is in no way affected. Another example of academic dishonesty is a dialogue between students in the same class but in two different time periods, both of which a test is scheduled for that day. If the student in the earlier time period informs the other student in the later period about the test; that is considered academic dishonesty, even though the first student has not benefited himself.

One other method is taking advantage of time zones, particularly in exams administered worldwide. Those who take the exam first (likely in Oceania) can then post answers for those about to take the exam (in a time zone behind like Europe).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clampdown on timezone cheats|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/1788872.stm|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deception===
{{Main|Deception}}
Deception is providing false information to a teacher/instructor concerning a formal academic exercise. Examples of this include taking more time on a take-home test than is allowed, giving a dishonest excuse when asking for a deadline extension, or falsely claiming to have submitted work. This type of academic misconduct is often considered softer than the more obvious forms of cheating, and otherwise-honest students sometimes engage in this type of dishonesty without considering themselves cheaters. It is also sometimes done by students who have failed to complete an assignment, to avoid responsibility for doing so.

===Fabrication===
{{Main|Lie#Fabrication}}
Fabrication is the falsification of data, information, or citations in any formal academic exercise. This includes making up citations to back up arguments or inventing quotations. Fabrication predominates in the natural sciences, where students sometimes falsify data to make experiments "work". It includes data falsification, in which false claims are made about research performed, including selective submitting of results to exclude inconvenient data to generating bogus data.

Bibliographical references are often fabricated, especially when a certain minimum number of references is required or considered sufficient for the particular kind of paper. This type of fabrication can range from referring to works whose titles look relevant but which the student did not read, to making up bogus titles and authors.

There is also the practice of ''dry-labbing''—which can occur in [[chemistry]] or other lab courses, in which the teacher clearly expects the experiment to yield certain results (which confirm established laws), so the student starts from the results and works backward, calculating what the experimental data should be, often adding variation to the data. In some cases, the lab report is written before the experiment is conducted—in some cases, the experiment is never carried out. In either case, the results are what the instructor expects.

===Impersonation===
{{Main|Impersonation}}
Impersonation is a form of cheating whereby a different person than the student assigned an assignment or exam completes it. Different from regular cheating,{{clarify|date=July 2012}} the academic work is totally 'outsourced' to another person or organization, usually for pay.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131110202253/http://www.ohiomatyc.org/web_documents/newsletter_fall_09.pdf Ohiomatyc News]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plagiarism ===
{{Main|Plagiarism}}
Plagiarism, as defined in the 1995 ''Random House Compact Unabridged Dictionary'', is the "use or close imitation of the language and thoughts of another author and the representation of them as one's own [[original work]]".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in {{Cite book| title = Library plagiarism policies | first = Vera | last= Stepchyshyn |author2=Robert S.

The modern concept of plagiarism as [[immoral]] and [[originality]] as an [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] emerged in Europe only in the 18th century, while in the previous centuries authors and artists were encouraged to "copy the masters as closely as possible" and avoid "unnecessary invention".&lt;ref name="Lynch02"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynch, Jack|url=http://www.writing-world.com/rights/lynch.shtml|title=The Perfectly Acceptable Practice of Literary Theft: Plagiarism, Copyright, and the Eighteenth Century|journal=Colonial Williamsburg: The Journal of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation|volume=24|number=4|date=Winter 2002–2003|pages=51–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Will63"&gt;Will, Frederic (1963) [https://www.jstor.org/pss/20162879 ''Publica materies''], in ''Arion''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RSC07"&gt;{{cite book|publisher = [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] |date = 2007|title = The RSC Shakespeare - William Shakespeare Complete Works|chapter = Introduction to the Comedy of Errors |page = 215| quote=...while we applaud difference, Shakespeare's first audiences favoured likeness: a work was good not because it was original, but because it resembled an admired classical exemplar, which in the case of comedy meant a play by Terence or Plautus...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Lindey52"&gt;Lindey, Alexander (1952) ''Plagiarism and Originality''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Young59"&gt;[[Edward Young]] (1759) ''Conjectures on Original Composition''&lt;/ref&gt; The 18th century new morals have been institutionalized and enforced prominently in the sectors of academia (including academic science, education, engineering etc.) and [[journalism]], where plagiarism is now considered academic dishonesty and a breach of [[journalistic ethics]], subject to sanctions like [[Expulsion (academia)|expulsion]] and other severe career damages. Not so in [[the arts]], which have resisted in their long-established tradition of copying as a fundamental practice of the [[creative process]], with plagiarism being still hugely tolerated by 21st-century artists.&lt;ref name="Alfrey"&gt;{{cite web|author=Alfrey, Penelope|url=http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/alfrey.html|title=Petrarch's Apes: Originality, Plagiarism and Copyright Principles within Visual Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawmaking is a professional field which is not structured around the concept of originality and for which plagiarism is less relevant.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===Professorial misconduct===
Professorial misconduct includes improper grading of students' papers and oral exams, grade fraud, deliberate negligence towards cheating or assistance in cheating. This can be done for reasons of personal bias towards students (favoritism) or a particular viewpoint (intellectual dishonesty), for a [[bribe]], or to improve the teacher's own perceived performance by increasing the passing rate. It is still occasionally done for matters of ego or to procure sexual favors (sexual harassment).

===Sabotage===
{{Main|Sabotage}}
Sabotage is when a student or professor prevents others from completing their work. This includes cutting pages out of library books, deleting data off of classmate's computer or otherwise willfully disrupting the experiments of others. Sabotage is usually only found in highly [[competition|competitive]], cutthroat environments, such as at extremely elite schools where class rankings are highly prized.
Poor behavior and the low level disruption of other students' learning, however, is extremely common in all educational settings.
Some medical-school librarians have noted that important articles—required reading for key courses—are frequently missing from bound journals—sliced out with razor blades, scalpels, or other sharp blades. Other journals will be marked up in crayon. {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

==Causes==
There are a variety of causes of academic misconduct. Researchers have studied the correlation of cheating to personal characteristics, demographics, contextual factors, methods of deterring misconduct, even [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development|stages of moral development]].

===Incentives to cheat===
Some scholars contend that there are students who have a pathological urge to cheat. The writer [[Thomas Mallon]] noted that many scholars had found plagiarism in literature ([[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and [[Charles Reade]] being two notable examples) to often be perpetrated in a way similar to [[kleptomania]] (a psychological disease associated with uncontrollable stealing, even when it is against the interests of the thief).&lt;ref&gt;Mallon, 84.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Mallon concludes it is probable that most "cheaters" make a rational choice to commit academic misconduct.&lt;ref name="Sattler, S. 2013"&gt;Sattler, S., Graeff, P., Willen, S. (2013). "Explaining the Decision to Plagiarize: An Empirical Test of the Interplay between Rationality, Norms, and Opportunity", Deviant Behavior 34: 444-463 [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01639625.2012.735909#.VOzjCPmG_dA])&lt;/ref&gt; A common reason for unethical behavior is the desire to "gain a competitive advantage in the race for position or power".&lt;ref name="Vojinovic and Abbott, 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vojinovic|first1= Zoran|last2= Abbott |first2= Michael B. |date =2012|title = Flood Risk and Social Justice|publisher = IWA Publishing|isbn= 9781843393870}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/ndu/strat-ldr-dm/pt4ch15.html|title=Values and Ethics|website=www.au.af.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Fass puts forward the possibility that business scandals in the real world make students believe dishonesty is an acceptable method for achieving success in contemporary society.&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Fass, "By Honor Bound: Encouraging Academic Honesty", ''Educational Record'' 67, no. 4 (Fall 1986), 32.&lt;/ref&gt;  Academic dishonesty, in this case, would be practice for the real world. For some students, there would be a dichotomy between success and honesty, and their decision is that: "It is not that we love honesty less, but that we love success more."&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, other scholars consider that with the recent rise in corporate ethics related dismissals in the business world, this approach to cheating may be losing its appeal, if it ever really had any.&lt;ref&gt;Landon Tomas Jr., "On Wall Street, a Rise in Dismissals over Ethics", ''New York Times,'' 29 March 2005 late ed., A1.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been shown that the expected benefits of cheating as well as student's morality plays an important role for the engagement in dishonest behavior.&lt;ref name="Sattler, S. 2013"/&gt;

Recent studies have indicated that there is no clear link between academic dishonesty and academic success{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;!---Conclusive study?---&gt;. One study showed that students given an unexpected opportunity to cheat did not improve their grades significantly from the control group.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Whitley and Keith-Spiegel, 35.{{incomplete citation|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study showed that students who were allowed to bring cheat sheets to a test did not improve their grades.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;  While this may conflict with the common perception of cheating (one survey found only 13% of males and 46% of females think that cheating does not help grades,&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;) it is often apparent to professors and members of academic conduct committees when a paper has been plagiarized by its inferior quality.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} &lt;!--Bowers?---&gt;

In the USA, William Bowers reported that, on average, one third of grade A students cheated in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, 74.&lt;/ref&gt; And asserts that academic dishonesty acts as a shortcut, so even grade A students might be tempted to cheat. He contends that even if a plagiarized paper receives a relatively low grade, that grade is actually high, given how much time and effort went into the paper. In the study mentioned above (in which students were allowed to bring crib sheets to a test but did not improve their scores), the researcher concluded that the students used the crib notes as alternatives to studying, rather than as complements to studying, and thus spent less time preparing for the exam.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

====Teachers====
The federal government of the United States has mandated high-stakes testing as part of the [[No Child Left Behind Act]], signed into law in 2002. Schools and teachers are held accountable for the results. According to Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner, co-authors of ''Freakonomics'', teachers are known to "teach to the test": while not teaching the actual answers, they teach the questions and similar ones, and they neglect any topic that will not be tested on. Levitt also states that teachers may inflate the results of tests given in their classroom.&lt;ref name="Jacob-Levitt-2003" /&gt; Teachers and librarians can have a significant proactive impact on doing honest work.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://blogs.tip.duke.edu/giftedtoday/2008/10/03/guiding-the-gifted-to-honest-work/|title = Guiding the Gifted to Honest Work| website = Gifted Today|publisher = Duke TIP|last = Abilock|first = Debbie|date = Fall 2008|deadurl = no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221141749/http://www.dukegiftedletter.com/articles/vol9no1_feature.html |archivedate=February 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographic and personal causes===
Research has identified a number of demographic characteristics that appear to be important influences on cheating, including age, gender and grade point average.&lt;ref name=McCabe&gt;Donald L. McCabe and Linda Klebe Trevino, "Individual and Contextual Influences on Academic Dishonesty: A Multicampus Investigation", ''Research in Higher Education'' 38, no. 2, (1997), 380.&lt;/ref&gt; Older students, females, and students with higher academic achievement&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;Jude Carroll, ''A Handbook for Deterring Plagiarism in Higher Education''(Oxford: The Oxford Centre for Staff and Learning Development, 2002), 18.&lt;/ref&gt; are less likely to cheat, whereas students involved with many extra-curricular activities are more likely to do so. Students involved in  extra-curricular activities may be less committed to their studies, or may have more demands on their time, which interfere with their studies, creating a greater incentive to cheat.  It has been found that younger students are somewhat more likely to cheat: one study finding the highest incidence of cheating occurs during sophomore year at college.&lt;ref name = smithdavyeasterling&gt;Kenneth J. Smith, Jeanette A. Davy, and Debbie Easterling, "An Examination of Cheating and its Antecedents Among Marketing and Management Majors", ''The Journal of Business Ethics''50, no. 1, (March 2004), 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Although cheating might be expected to decline with greater moral development, one experiment found that there was no relationship between how a student performed on a [[Defining Issues Test|morality test]] and his likelihood of cheating (that is, students at a [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development#Pre-conventional|pre-conventional]] stage of morality are as likely to cheat as those at a [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development#Post-Conventional|post-conventional]] stage).&lt;ref&gt;Tim West, Sue Ravenscroft, and Charles Shrader, "Cheating and Moral Judgment in the College Classroom: A Natural Experiment", ''Journal of Business Ethics'' 54, no. 2, (October 2004), 181.&lt;/ref&gt;  Higher academic procrastination was also found to increase the frequency of seven different forms of academic misconduct (using fraudulent excuses, plagiarism, copying from someone else in exams, using forbidden means in exams, carrying forbidden means into exams, copying parts of homework from others, and fabrication or falsification of data) as well as the variety of academic misconduct.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt; This German panel study among thousands of university students argues that academic misconduct might be a coping-strategy to overcome the negative consequences of academic procrastination such as lower performance.

[[Race (classification of human beings)|Race]], [[nationality]], and [[social class|class]] all show little correlation with academic misconduct. There is also no correlation between how religious someone is and the likelihood that that person will cheat. A comparison between students of different [[religion]]s yielded similar results, although the study did show that [[Jews]] tend to cheat less than members of other religions.&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, 207&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the strongest demographic correlations with academic misconduct in the United States is with language. Students who speak [[English language|English]] as a second language have been shown to commit academic dishonesty more and are more likely to be caught than native speakers, since they will often not want to rewrite sources in their own words, fearing that the meaning of the sentence will be lost through poor paraphrasing skills.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[University of California]] system, [[international students]] make up 10% of the student body but comprise 47% of academic dishonesty cases.&lt;ref&gt;Decoo, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Universities in the United Kingdom|British universities]], students from outside of the [[European Union]] make up 12% of the student body but comprise 35% of academic dishonesty cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Universities catch almost 50,000 student cheats| newspaper =The Guardian| date =2 January 2016| url =https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/02/universities-catch-almost-50000-student-cheats| access-date =9 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contextual causes===
Academic misconduct is more easily traced to the academic and social environment of students than to their background. These contextual factors can be as broad as the social milieu at school to as narrow as what instructions a teacher gives before an exam.

Contextual factors that individual teachers can affect often make the least difference on cheating behavior. A study found that increasing the distance between students taking an exam has little effect on academic misconduct, and that threatening students before an exam with expulsion if they cheat actually promotes cheating behavior.&lt;ref name= Kerkvliet&gt;Joe Kerkvliet and Charles L. Sigmund, "Can We Control Cheating in the Classroom?", ''The Journal of Economic Education'' 30, no. 4, (Autumn, 1999), 331.&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, increased exam [[proctor]]ing and other methods of detecting cheating in the classroom are largely ineffective. According to one survey of American college students, while 50% had cheated at least once in the previous six months, and 7% had cheated more than five times in that period, only 2.5% of the cheaters had been caught.&lt;ref name = labeff192/&gt; As teachers invent more elaborate methods of deterring cheating, students invent even more elaborate methods of cheating (sometimes even treating it as a game), leading to what some teachers call a costly and unwinnable [[arms race]].&lt;ref&gt;Carrol, 61.&lt;/ref&gt;  Increased punishment for academic misconduct also has little correlation with cheating behavior. It has been found that students with markedly different perceptions of what the severity of the punishment for cheating were all equally likely to cheat, probably indicating that they thought that increased penalties were immaterial since their cheating would never be discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas N. Bunn, Steven B. Caudill, and Daniel M. Gropper, "Crime in the Classroom: An Economic Analysis of Undergraduate Student Cheating Behavior", ''The Journal of Economic Education'' 23, no. 3, (Summer 1992), 205.&lt;/ref&gt; However, if a professor makes clear that he disapproves of cheating, either in the syllabus, in the first class, or at the beginning of a test, academic dishonesty can drop by 12%.&lt;ref name= Kerkvliet/&gt;  Some professors may have little incentive to reduce cheating in their classes below a point that would otherwise be obvious to outside observers, as they are rated by how many research papers they publish and research grants they win for the college, and not by how well they teach.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.emich.edu/mthomsen/sape.htm|title=Eastern Michigan University: The Department of Physics and Astronomy|website=www.physics.emich.edu|access-date=2008-04-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080507120356/http://www.physics.emich.edu/mthomsen/sape.htm|archive-date=2008-05-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teachers can, however, accidentally promote cheating behavior. A study found a correlation between how harsh or unfair a professor is perceived as and academic misconduct, since students see cheating as a way of getting back at the teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Bushway and Nash, 628.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, students who see themselves in a competition, such as when the teacher is using a [[grade curve]], are more likely to cheat.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard E. Whitley, "Factors Associated with Cheating Among College Students: A Review", ''Research in Higher Education'' 39, no. 3, (June, 1998), 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has also shown a correlation between goal orientation and the occurrence of academic cheating. Students who perceive their classroom to have high mastery goals are less likely to engage in cheating than those who perceive their classroom to emphasize performance goals.&lt;ref&gt;Anderman, E., &amp; Midgley, C. (2004). Changes in self-reported academic cheating across the transition from middle school to high school. [[Contemporary Educational Psychology]], 29, 499-517.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, students who are encouraged to learn for the sake of learning and who exhibit an intrinsic value of education are less likely to cheat than those who are encouraged primarily by grades and other extrinsic rewards.

The most important contextual causes of academic misconduct are often out of individual teachers' hands. One very important factor is [[time management]]. One survey reported two-thirds of teachers believed that poor time management was the principal cause of cheating.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6" /&gt;  Often social engagements are to blame. It has been found that there is a strong correlation between [[extracurricular activities]] and cheating, especially among athletes, even those on intramural teams.&lt;ref&gt;McCabe and Trevino, "Multicampus Investigation", 382.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been found that student cheating rates rise significantly the more time students spend [[playing cards]], watching television, or having a few drinks with friends.&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, 104.&lt;/ref&gt;  Relatedly, [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity or sorority]] membership is also strongly correlated with academic misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;McCabe and Trevino, "Multicampus Investigation", 383.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important causes of academic misconduct is the contextual factor of an environment of peer disapproval of cheating, that is, [[peer pressure]]. Psychologists note that all people tend to follow the [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] of their [[peer group]], which would include norms about academic dishonesty.&lt;ref&gt;F. Clark Power, Ann Higgins, and Lawrence Kohlberg, ''Lawrence Kohlberg's Approach to Moral Education'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1989), 214.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, students who believe that their peers disapprove of cheating are less likely to cheat. Indeed, multiple studies show that the most decisive factor in a student's decision to cheat is his perception of his peers' relationship with academic dishonesty.&lt;ref name="mccabetrevino_honorcode_532" /&gt;  For instance, on average 69% of students cheat at colleges with low community disapproval of academic misconduct, whereas only about 23% of students cheat at colleges with strong community disapproval of academic misconduct.&lt;ref name=bowers155/&gt;  Peer pressure works both ways, as a study found that there is a 41% increase in the probability of a student cheating if he or she has seen someone else cheat.&lt;ref&gt;Bunn, Caudill, and Gropper, 204.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, even if most students strongly disapprove of cheating, there has to be a community in order for those norms to be enforced via peer pressure. For instance, larger schools, which usually have much higher cheating rates than small schools, tend to have a weaker community, being more split up into different peer groups that exert little social pressure on each other.&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, 199.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another measure of a college community, how many students live on campus, further shows a significant relation with a school's cheating rate.&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, 169.&lt;/ref&gt;  Relatedly, many professors argue that smaller classes reduce cheating behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Donald L. McCabe, Linda Klebe Trevino, and Donald L. Butterfield, "Honor Code and Other Contextual Influences on Academic Integrity: A Replication and Extension to Modified Honor Code Settings" ''Research in Higher Education'' 43, no. 3, (June 2002), 368.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethical causes===
No matter what the demographic or contextual influences are on a student who decides to engage in cheating behavior, before they can cheat they must overcome their own [[conscience]]. This depends both on how strongly someone disapproves of academic dishonesty and what types of justifications the student uses to escape a sense of guilt. For instance, students who personally do not have a moral problem with academic misconduct can cheat [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]-free. However, while many students have been taught and have internalized that academic dishonesty is wrong, it has been shown that on average a third of students who strongly disapprove of cheating have in fact cheated.&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, 72.&lt;/ref&gt;  People who cheat despite personal disapproval of cheating engage in something called "neutralization", in which a student rationalizes the cheating as being acceptable due to certain mitigating circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Richard A. Bernardi, Rene L. Metzger, Ryann G. Scofield Bruno, Marisa A. Wade Hoogkamp, Lillian E. Reyes, and Gary H. Barnaby|title=Examining the Decision Process of Students' Cheating Behavior: An Empirical Study|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|volume=50|number= 1|year=2004|page=399|doi=10.1023/B:BUSI.0000025039.47788.c2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to psychologists of deviant behavior, people who engage in neutralization support the societal norm in question, but "conjure up" reasons why they are allowed to violate that norm in a particular case.&lt;ref name = smithdavyeasterling/&gt;  Neutralization is not a simple case of ''ex post facto'' rationalization, but is rather a more comprehensive affair, occurring before, during, and after the act of cheating.&lt;ref&gt;LaBeff, et al., 191.&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers have found four major types of neutralization of academic dishonesty, which they categorize by type of justification.  ''Denial of responsibility'' – that is, the accusation that others are to blame or that something forced the student to cheat – is the most common form of neutralization among college students who cheated, with 61% of cheaters using this form of justification.&lt;ref name="McCabe-1992"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Donald L. McCabe|title=The Influence of Situational Ethics on Cheating Among College Students|journal=Sociological Inquiry|volume=62|number=3|year=1992|page=368|doi=10.1111/j.1475-682X.1992.tb00287.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Condemnation of condemner'' – that is, that the professors are hypocrites or brought it on themselves – is the second most common form of college student neutralization at 28%.&lt;ref name="McCabe-1992" /&gt;  The third most popular form of neutralization among college students is the ''appeal to higher loyalties,'' where the student thinks their responsibility to some other entity, usually their peers, is more important than doing what they know to be morally right. About 6.8% of cheaters in higher education use this form of neutralization.&lt;ref name="McCabe-1992" /&gt; ''Denial of injury'' – thinking that nobody is worse off for the cheating – is the fourth most popular kind of neutralization at 4.2% of cheaters.&lt;ref name="McCabe-1992" /&gt;

==Effects==
{{essay-like|section|date=August 2015}}
Cheating in academics has a host of effects on students, on teachers, on individual schools, and on the educational system itself.

For instance, students who engage in neutralisation to justify cheating, even once, are more likely to engage in it in the future, potentially putting them on a road to a life of dishonesty.&lt;ref name = smithdavyeasterling/&gt;  Indeed, one study found that students who are dishonest in class are more likely to engage in fraud and theft on the job when they enter the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;Sarath Nonis and Cathy Owens Swift, "An Examination of the Relationship between Academic Dishonesty and Workplace Dishonesty", ''Journal of Business Education'' 77, no. 2, (November–December 2001), 69-77.&lt;/ref&gt; Students are also negatively affected by academic dishonesty after graduation. A university diploma is an important document in the [[labor market]]. Potential employers use a degree as a representation of a graduate's knowledge and ability. However, due to academic dishonesty, not all graduates with the same grades actually did the same work or have the same skills. Thus, when faced with the fact that they do not know which graduates are skilled and which are the "lemons" (see "[[The Market for Lemons]]"), employers must pay all graduates based on the quality of the average graduate. Therefore, the more students who cheat, getting by without achieving the required skills or learning, the lower the quality of the average graduate of a school, and thus the less employers are willing to pay a new hire from that school. Because of this reason, all students, even those that do not cheat themselves, are negatively affected by academic misconduct.

Academic dishonesty also creates problems for teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilmshurst |first=Peter |title=Dishonesty in Medical Research |url=http://www.medico-legalsociety.org.uk/articles/dishonesty_in_medical_research.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521050439/http://www.medico-legalsociety.org.uk/articles/dishonesty_in_medical_research.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In economic terms, cheating causes an underproduction of knowledge, where the professor's job is to produce knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Bunn, Caudill, and Gropper, 199.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, a case of cheating often will cause emotional distress to faculty members, many considering it to be a personal slight against them or a violation of their trust. Dealing with academic misconduct is often one of the worst parts of a career in education, one survey claiming that 77% of academics agreed with the statement "dealing with a cheating student is one of the most onerous aspects of the job".&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Whitley and Keith-Spiegel, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic misconduct can also have an effect on a college's reputation, one of the most important assets of any school. An institution plagued by cheating scandals may become less attractive to potential donors and students and especially prospective employers.  Alternatively, schools with low levels of academic dishonesty can use their reputation to attract students and employers.

Ultimately, academic dishonesty undermines the academic world. It interferes with the basic mission of education, the transfer of knowledge, by allowing students to get by without having to master the knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley and Keith-Spiegel, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, academic dishonesty creates an atmosphere that is not conducive to the learning process, which affects honest students as well.&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; When honest students see cheaters escape detection, it can discourage student morale, as they see the rewards for their work cheapened. Cheating also undermines academia when students steal ideas. Ideas are a professional author's "capital and identity", and if a person's ideas are stolen it retards the pursuit of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Thomas|last =  Mallon|title = Stolen Words|publisher =Harcourt |date = 2001|page =  4|isbn = 978-0156011365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If never formally retracted, fraudulent publications can remain an issue for many years as articles and books remain on shelves and continue to be cited. The case of [[S. Walter Poulshock]], a 1960s early-career historian whose work was found to contain wholly fabricated material, was exposed in 1966 with the ''[[American Historical Review]]'' providing a warning on the topic.&lt;ref name="Sternstein 02"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sternstein|first1=Jerome|title=Historical Fraud and the Seduction of Ideas: The Poulshock Case|url=http://historynewsnetwork.org/article/568|website=History News Network|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Luker&gt;{{cite web|last1=Luker|first1=Ralph|title=The Year When We Got Caught|url=http://historynewsnetwork.org/article/1184|website=History News Network|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, his book was never removed from the shelves of many university libraries and (together with his related thesis) was still being cited in 2013, 47 years after it was intended to have been withdrawn by its publisher.&lt;ref name=Margolies&gt;{{cite book|last1=Margolies|first1=Daniel S.|title=Henry Watterson and the new South the politics of empire, free trade, and globalization|date=2006|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|location=Lexington, Ky.|isbn=9780813138527|page=317|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hTk7xGOP66wC&amp;pg=PA317|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Farrar-Myers"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farrar-Myers|first1=Victoria A.|title=Scripted for change: the institutionalization of the American presidency|date=2007|publisher=Texas A &amp; M University Press|location=College Station|isbn=9781603444637|page=252|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pW9ojP-HMbYC&amp;pg=PT271|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sachsman&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sachsman|first1=David|last2=Bulla|first2=David|title=Sensationalism murder, mayhem, mudslinging, scandals, and disasters in|date=2013|publisher=Transaction|location=[S.l.]|isbn=9781412851138|page=144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_RduAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA144|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Skocpol&gt;{{cite book|last1=Skocpol|first1=Theda|title=Protecting soldiers and mothers the political origins of social policy in the United States|date=1995|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780674043725|page=581|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LHTHNalul5IC&amp;pg=PA581|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deterrence==
All parties involved in the dishonesty&amp;mdash;not just the individual whose grade is increased by it&amp;mdash;can be punished.

Historically the job of preventing cheating has been given to the teacher. It used to be that in college the professor acted ''[[in loco parentis]]'' and was able to regulate student behavior as a parent.&lt;ref name = hardyburch&gt;"Richard J. Hardy and David Burch, "What Political Science Professors Should Know in Dealing with Academic Dishonesty", ''Teaching Political Science'' 9, no. 2 (Fall 1981), 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, professors who discovered cheating could assign essentially any punishment they deemed appropriate. Students often had no mechanism for appeal. Generally, proctors were hired to patrol exams. If a case was particularly serious, a dean or other top-level administrator might have been involved. Against this inconsistent and paternalistic system, students at some schools rebelled and demanded to be treated as adults.

===Honor codes===
{{Main|Academic honor code}}
First at the [[College of William and Mary]] in 1779, and then followed by schools like the University of Virginia in the 1850s and [[Wesleyan University]] in 1893, the students, with the agreement of faculty who declared themselves dedicated to ideals of democracy and human character, created honor codes.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Roy Geiger, ''The Honor System in Colleges'' (Williamsburg, VA: College of William and Mary, 1937), 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  B. Melendez of Harvard University defined an honor code as a code of academic conduct that includes a written pledge of honesty that students sign, a student controlled [[judiciary]] that hears alleged violations, unproctored examinations, and an obligation for all students help enforce the code.&lt;ref&gt;Donald L. McCabe, Linda Klebe Trevino, and Kenneth D. Butterfield, "Academic Integrity in Honor Code and Non-Honor Code Environments: A Qualitative Investigation", ''The Journal of Higher Education 70, no. 2 (March–April 1999), 213.&lt;/ref&gt;  This system relied on student self-enforcement, which was considered more becoming of young gentlemen than the policing by proctors and professors that existed previously. Of interest, the [[military academies]] of the US took the honor code one step further than civilian colleges, disallowing "tolerance", which means that if a cadet or midshipman is found to have failed to report or outright protected someone engaged in academic dishonesty (as well as other dishonesties or stealing), that individual is to be expelled along with the perpetrator.

===Mixed judicial boards===
However, many people doubted the advisability of relying on an abstract notion of honor to prevent academic dishonesty. This doubt has perhaps led to the reality that no more than a quarter of American universities have adopted honor codes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Bowers, 184.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, many professors could not envisage a student run trial process that treated faculty accusers fairly. In response to these concerns, in the middle of the twentieth century, many schools devised mixed judicial panels composed of both students and faculty. This type of academic integrity system was similar to the traditional faculty control system in that it relied on professors to detect cheating, except in this system cheaters were brought before centralized boards of students and faculty for punishment. By the 1960s over a quarter of American universities had adopted this system of mixed judicial boards.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;  Still, though, over half of American universities continued to use faculty-centered control systems.

===Student due process rights===
Starting in the 1960s, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] began chipping away at the ''in loco parentis'' doctrine, giving college students more [[civil liberties]] such as the right of [[due process]] in disciplinary proceedings (''[[Dixon v. Alabama Board of Education]],'' 1961).&lt;ref name = hardyburch/&gt;  In ''Cooper v. Blair'' (1973), specifically academic misconduct was ruled to require due process, being a disciplinary matter and not an educational matter.{{Citation needed|reason=Could not google anything about it at all.|date=January 2017}} The due process rights of students in academic misconduct cases is not to the same degree as in a court of law. For instance, the student has no right to representation and the burden of proof is not necessarily stringent. In the "General Order on Judicial Standards of Procedure and Substance in Review of Student Discipline in Tax Supported Institutions of Higher Education", (1968) student due process rights were laid out as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;
# The student should be given adequate notice in writing of the specific ground or grounds and the nature of the evidence on which the discipline proceedings are based.
# The student should be given an opportunity for a hearing in which the disciplinary authority provides a fair opportunity for hearing of the student's position, explanations, or evidence.
# No disciplinary action may be taken on grounds which are not supported by any substantial evidence.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These new rules put an end to the old faculty-based system of policing academic dishonesty, now students were entitled to an impartial hearing. While schools using the old honor code method or the mixed judicial system were not affected by these decisions, schools using the faculty based system generally instituted systems that relied on a committee of faculty and administrators or a dean to run the academic misconduct hearings.

===Modified honor codes===
Recently, Donald L. McCabe and Linda Klebe Trevino, two experts in the field of academic dishonesty, have proposed a new way of deterring cheating that has been implemented in schools such as the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]. Modified honor codes put students in charge of the judicial hearing process, making it clear that it is the students' responsibility to stop cheating amongst themselves, but at the same time students still have proctored exams and are not allowed to take pledges of good conduct in place of professor oversight.&lt;ref&gt;McCabe, Trevino and Butterfield, "Modified Honor Code" 357.&lt;/ref&gt;  The researchers who advocate this type of code seem to think that the normal honor code is something of a special case that is not applicable to many schools.&lt;ref&gt;McCabe, Trevino and Butterfield, "Modified Honor Code", 362.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to supporters of this system, schools with a large student body, a weak college community, or no history of student self-governance will not be able to support a full honor code. However, while modified honor codes seem to be more effective than faculty or administration run integrity codes of conduct, research shows that schools with modified codes still have higher rates of cheating than schools with full honor codes.&lt;ref&gt;McCabe, Trevino and Butterfield, "Modified Honor Code", 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison of different systems of enforcement===
Research has shown that there is a strong correlation between forms of academic integrity system and levels of cheating at a school. Several studies have found students who attend schools with honor codes are less likely to cheat than students at schools with traditional integrity codes.&lt;ref name="mccabetrevino_honorcode_532" /&gt;  Another study found that only 28% of schools with honor codes have high levels of cheating, whereas 81% of schools with mixed judicial boards have high rates of cheating.&lt;ref name=bowers155 /&gt;  Whereas faculty or administration run codes of conduct tend to rely on policing and punishment to deter students from cheating, honor codes tend to rely on and cultivate student senses of honor and group peer pressure to deter academic misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;McCabe and Trevino, "Multicampus Investigation", 384.&lt;/ref&gt;  As mentioned above in the section on causes of cheating, increased enforcement or punishment is rarely effective at discouraging cheating, whereas there is a high correlation between peer pressure and academic honesty. The modified honor code attempts to cultivate peer disapproval of cheating while maintaining the traditional proctor system, although critics argue that the proctor system undermines the creation of an atmosphere of student self-policing, reducing the effectiveness of the honor code, possibly explaining why modified honor codes have not been as effective as the original version.

===Faculty issues in deterring academic dishonesty===
There are limitations to relying on the faculty to police academic dishonesty. One study found that up to 21% of professors have ignored at least one clear cut case of cheating.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley and Keith-Spiegel, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study revealed that 40% of professors "never" report cheating, 54% "seldom" report cheating, and that a mere 6% act on all cases of academic misconduct that confront them.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, A8.&lt;/ref&gt;  A third survey of professors found that while 79% had observed cheating, only 9% had penalized the student.&lt;ref&gt;Donald L. McCabe, Kenneth D. Butterfield, and Linda Klebe Trevino, "Faculty and Academic Integrity: The Influence of Current Honor Codes and Past Honor Code Experiences," ''Research in Higher Education'' 44, no. 3 (June 2003), 368.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a manual for professors on cheating,

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;
the reasons for this lack of action include unwillingness to devote time and energy to the issue, reluctance to undergo an emotional confrontation, and fear of retaliation by the student, of losing students, of being accused of harassment or discrimination, and even of being sued for these offenses and/or defamation of character.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are other reasons as well. Some professors are reluctant to report violations to the appropriate authorities because they believe the punishment to be too harsh.&lt;ref name = schneidera9&gt;Alison Schneider, "Why Professors Don't Do More to Stop Students who Cheat," ''Chronicle of Higher Education,'' 22 January 1999, A9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some professors may have little incentive to reduce cheating in their classes below a point that would otherwise be obvious to outside observers, as they are rated by how many research papers they publish&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Erasmus University |title=2014 Report on Academic Conduct |url=http://www.erasmusmc.nl/perskamer/archief/2014/4761230/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911071132/http://www.erasmusmc.nl/perskamer/archief/2014/4761230/ |dead-url=no |archive-date=11 September 2014 |accessdate=10 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and research grants they win for the college, and not by how well they teach.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

Others do not report academic misconduct because of [[postmodernist]] views on cheating. Postmodernism calls into question the very concepts of "authorship" and "originality."  From the perspective of cultural studies and historicism, authors themselves are simply constructs of their social surroundings, and thus they simply rewrite already written cultural stories. Moreover, in the field of composition studies, students are being encouraged more and more to do group work and participate in ongoing collective revision. The postmodernist view is that "the concept of intellectual malpractice is of limited [[epistemological]] value. Under the ironic gaze of postmodernism, the distinctions between guilt and innocence, integrity and deceit permeating the scandal debates appear irrelevant."&lt;ref&gt;Ron Robin, ''Scandals and Scoundrels: Seven Cases that Shook the Academy.'' (Berkeley: [[University of California Press]], 2004), 222.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is an argument that postmodernism is just [[moral relativism]], therefore cheating is condoned as a valid academic method, even if it is morally and legally wrong. One professor wrote in an article in ''The English Journal'' that when he peeked in on an unproctored class taking a test and saw several students up and consulting with one another, he decided that they were not cheating, but were using non-traditional techniques and collaborative learning to surmount the obstacles teachers had put in their way.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Davis, "Student Cheating: A Defensive Essay," ''The English Journal'' 81, no. 6 (October 1992), 72.&lt;/ref&gt;  Issues of cultural relativism also affect professors' views on cheating; the standard objection being that "students from certain Middle Eastern, Asian, and African cultures are baffled by the notion that one can 'own' ideas, since their cultures regard words and ideas as the property of all rather than as individual property".&lt;ref&gt;S.H. McLeod quoted in Whitley, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue teachers may have with deterring cheating is that they may decide that it is not their job. The argument that "they're professors, not policemen" is often heard in academia.&lt;ref name = schneidera9/&gt;  In economic terms, some professors believe they are being paid to provide learning, and if the student loses that learning through cheating, he is only cheating himself out of the money he paid.&lt;ref&gt;Decoo, 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exposure of falsified data==
With the advancement of the internet, there are now several tools available to aid in the detection of plagiarism and [[multiple publication]] within biomedical literature. One tool developed in 2006 by researchers in [[Harold Garner]]'s laboratory at the [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas]] is [https://web.archive.org/web/20080908042940/http://spore.swmed.edu/dejavu/ Déjà Vu], an open-access database containing several thousand instances of duplicate publication.

A '''tenured''' appointment is an indefinite academic appointment that can be terminated only for [[Causation (law)|cause]] or under extraordinary circumstances, such as financial exigency or program discontinuation. Tenure is a means of defending the principle of [[academic freedom]], which holds that it is beneficial for society in the long run if scholars are free to hold and examine a variety of views.

The modern conception of tenure in US higher education originated with the [[American Association of University Professors]]' (AAUP) 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aaup.org/report/1940-statement-principles-academic-freedom-and-tenure|title=1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure – AAUP|website=Aaup.org|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jointly formulated and endorsed by the AAUP and the [[Association of American Colleges and Universities]] (AAC&amp;U), the 1940 Statement is endorsed by over 250 scholarly and higher education organizations and is widely adopted into faculty handbooks and collective bargaining agreements at institutions of higher education throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aaup.org/issues/tenure|title=What is academic tenure?|website=Aaup.org|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement holds that, "The common good depends upon the free search for truth and its free exposition" and stresses that academic freedom is essential in teaching and research in this regard.

== By Country ==
=== North America ===
{{See also|Academic tenure in North America}}
Under the tenure systems adopted by many [[university|universities]] and [[college]]s in the United States and Canada, some faculty positions have tenure and some do not. Typical systems (such as the widely adopted "1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure" of the [[American Association of University Professors]]&lt;ref&gt;http://aaup.org/report/1940-statement-principles-academic-freedom-and-tenure; this statement has been adopted by more than 200 scholarly and academic groups (http://aaup.org/endorsers-1940-statement). The American Association of University Professors also publishes [http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/pubsres/policydocs/contents/RIR.htm "Recommended Institutional Regulations on Academic Freedom and Tenure"].&lt;/ref&gt;) allow only a limited period to establish a record of published research, ability to attract grant funding, [[academic visibility]], teaching excellence, and administrative or community service. They limit the number of years that any employee can remain employed as a non-tenured instructor or professor, compelling the institution to grant tenure to or terminate an individual, with significant advance notice, at the end of a specified time period. Some institutions require promotion to Associate Professor as a condition of tenure. An institution may also offer other academic positions that are not time-limited, with titles such as Lecturer, Adjunct Professor, or Research Professor, but these positions do not carry the possibility of tenure and are said to not be "tenure track." Typically, they have higher teaching loads, lower compensation, little influence within the institution, few if any benefits, and little protection of academic freedom.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

=== United Kingdom ===
{{See also|Academic ranks in the United Kingdom|Lecturer}}
Academic tenure was eliminated in the United Kingdom in 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/40/contents|title=Education Reform Act 1988|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/explainer-how-europe-does-academic-tenure-43362|title=Explainer: how Europe does academic tenure|last=Enders|first=Jürgen|work=The Conversation|access-date=4 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its place there is the distinction between permanent and temporary contracts for academics. A permanent lecturer in UK universities usually holds an open-ended position that covers teaching, research, and administrative responsibilities.

Research lecturers (where they are permanent appointments) are the equivalent in rank of lecturers and senior lecturers, but reflect a research-intensive orientation. Research lecturers are common in fields such as medicine, engineering, and biological and physical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eui.eu/ProgrammesAndFellowships/AcademicCareersObservatory/AcademicCareersbyCountry/UnitedKingdom|title=United Kingdom, Academic Career Structure|work=European University Institute|access-date=4 May 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Germany ===
{{See also|Habilitation#Germany|Academic ranks in Germany}}
Academics are divided into two classes. On the one hand, professors (C2/W2 positions in the old/new system of pay grades) are employed as civil servants of the state and hold tenure as a highly safeguarded employment for life. On the other, there is a much bigger group of "junior staff" on fixed-term contracts, research grants, fellowships, and part-time jobs. In 2010, 9% of academic staff were professors, 66% were "junior staff" (including doctoral candidates on contracts), and 25% were other academic staff in secondary employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buwin.de/dateien/2013/buwin2013keyresults.pdf/view|title=buwin2013keyresults.pdf — BuWiN 2017|website=www.buwin.de|language=de|access-date=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Permanent research, teaching and management positions below professorship as an "Akademischer Rat" (a civil service position salaried like high school teachers) have become relatively rare compared to the 1970s and 1980s and are often no longer refilled after a retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/wissen/akademische-karrieren-manche-verteidigen-das-system-als-charakterbildend-/5942506-3.html|title=Prekäre Arbeitsverhältnisse an Universitäten nehmen zu
|language=de|access-date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to attain the position of Professor an academic must usually complete a "[[Habilitation]]" (a kind of broader second PhD thesis), after which she or he is eligible for tenureship. This means that, compared to other countries, academics in Germany obtain tenure at a relatively late age, as on average one becomes an Academic Assistant at the age of 42.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206154130/https://theconversation.com/explainer-how-europe-does-academic-tenure-43362|title=Explainer: how Europe does academic tenure|date=6 February 2018|access-date=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 the "Juniorprofessur" position (comparable to an assistant professor in the US, but rarely endowed with a tenure track) was introduced as an alternative to "Habilitation". However, the degree of formal equivalence between a "Habilitation" and a successfully completed "Juniorprofessur" varies across the different states (''Bundesländer''), and the informal recognition of having served as a "Juniorprofessur" as a replacement for the "Habilitation" in the appointment procedures for professorships varies greatly between disciplines.

Due to a university system that guarantees universities relative academic freedom, the position of professor in Germany is stronger and more independent than, for instance, in France.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} As civil servants, professors have a series of attendant rights and benefits, yet this status is subject to discussion; for example, the question of relating professorial pay to performance rather than merely to age is now being considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170724064559/http://www.eui.eu:80/ProgrammesAndFellowships/AcademicCareersObservatory/AcademicCareersbyCountry/Germany.aspx#SecurityInThePosition|title=Germany, Academic Career Structure • European University Institute|date=24 July 2017|access-date=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arguments in favor ==
Many argue, among other things, that the job security granted by tenure is necessary to recruit talented individuals into professorships, because in many fields private industry jobs pay significantly more. 

== Arguments against ==
Some have argued that modern tenure systems diminish academic freedom, forcing those seeking tenured positions to profess conformance to the level of mediocrity as those awarding the tenured professorships. For example, according to physicist [[Lee Smolin]], "...it is practically career suicide for a young theoretical physicist not to join the field of [[string theory]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Trouble with Physics]]|author=Lee Smolin|date=2008|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-101835-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Economist [[Steven Levitt]], who recommends the elimination of tenure in order to incentivize higher performance among professors, also points out that a pay increase may be required to compensate faculty members for the lost job security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freakonomics.com/2007/03/03/lets-just-get-rid-of-tenure/|title=Let’s Just Get Rid of Tenure (Including Mine)|last1=Levitt|first1=Steven|authorlink=Steven Levitt|website=[[Freakonomics]]|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some U.S. states have considered legislation to remove tenure at public universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/01/13/legislation-two-states-seeks-eliminate-tenure-public-higher-education|title=Killing Tenure|last1=Flaherty|first1=Colleen|website=[[Inside Higher Ed]]|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A further criticism of tenure is that it rewards complacency. Once a professor is awarded tenure, he or she may begin putting reduced effort into their job, knowing that their removal is difficult or expensive to the institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/01/07/study-links-tenure-criteria-long-term-professor-performance|title=Study links tenure criteria to long-term professor performance|website=Insidehighered.com|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Agostini v. Felton''''', 521 U.S. 203 (1997), is a landmark decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. In this case, the Court overruled its decision in ''[[Aguilar v. Felton]]'' (1985), now finding that it was not a violation of the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] for a state-sponsored education initiative to allow public school teachers to instruct at religious schools, so long as the material was secular and neutral in nature and no "excessive entanglement" between government and religion was apparent. This case is noteworthy in a broader sense as a sign of evolving judicial standards surrounding the First Amendment, and the changes that have occurred in modern Establishment Clause jurisprudence.

==Background==
In 1965, [[United States Congress|Congress]] enacted Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act with the goal of providing adequate education to all children in the United States, regardless of individual economic conditions. This service, abbreviated as Title I, distributed federal funds to state governments, which, in turn, disbursed the funds to local education agencies. This funding was to be put towards providing remedial education services for low-income students who were at significant risk of failing to meet state academic performance standards. By law, these education services were to be provided to eligible students, whether enrolled in public school or not. Further, the services offered to children attending private schools were to be "equitable in comparison" to the services offered to children attending public school. All educational services were to be of a secular, neutral, and non-ideological nature.

In 1966, the Board of Education of the City of New York ("Board") applied for Title I funding. In the eligible districts in New York City, 10% of schoolchildren attend private school, and of those 10%, 90% attended schools of a particular religious ideology. To prevent First Amendment complications, the Board arranged to bus private school attendees to public schools for after-school instruction. This plan failed, and another one was adopted, which failed as well. The Board then moved on to a plan whereby public school teachers would be permitted to provide instruction in the private school buildings themselves. A number of stipulations were attached to this, aimed at preventing a violation of the Establishment Clause, including mandatory surprise visits by state-employed supervisors and removal of all religious articles from the room to be used for Title I instruction. This plan was reviewed by the Supreme Court in ''[[Aguilar v. Felton]]'', where it was deemed to create a constitutionally impermissible "entanglement" between government and religion. The District Court, on [[Remand (court procedure)|remand]], issued an injunction, enjoining the Board from following a Title I plan that violated the decision.

After the Court's decision in Aguilar, the Board had to devise a new plan to provide Title I services without creating a conflict between Church and State. This plan involved spending over $100,000,000 in leasing property and vehicles to provide areas for public school teachers to instruct their students. This money, incurred annually over a series of years, had to be deducted from the Title 1 grant before the grant money was to be used for actual services provided, resulting in a net decrease in available funds for remedial education. In 1995, the Board, along with a group of parents of eligible parochial school attendees, filed motions in District Court, seeking an exemption from the Aguilar decision under [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure|Federal Rule of Civil Procedure]] 60(b). This rule states, in part, that an exemption from a final judgment may be granted if it is found that it is, "no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application." They argued that cases decided by the Supreme Court between Aguilar and 1995 had eroded the meaning of Aguilar, and that it was no longer good law. The District Court appeared sympathetic, and said that they were pursuing the appropriate method of relief, but denied the motion, noting that Aguilar was still in effect and it was unable to offer the exemption the Board sought. The [[Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] affirmed the denial of the motion. The Supreme Court granted [[certiorari]] and heard arguments on April 15, 1997. Chief Corporation Counsel Paul Crotty argued on behalf of New York City, marking the last time that the city's chief attorney has appeared before the nation's highest court.

==Arguments==
The [[petitioner]]s argument for relief revolved around three primary points.

* 1. The tremendous costs involved with running their Title I program in accordance with Aguilar constituted a substantial change of fact. They argued that, because these costs were not expected to be so high at the start, it was now imprudent to force them to continue in this fashion. The [[respondent]]s countered by saying that the costs of implementing the program were, in fact, known when Aguilar was decided, which would mean that no change in circumstances had occurred.
* 2. Prevailing agreement in the judiciary had turned against Aguilar, with a majority of Justices having expressed their opinion that Aguilar should be reversed or, at least, reconsidered.
* 3. Subsequent Establishment Clause rulings by the Supreme Court had undermined the legal basis upon which Aguilar was decided. The argument was that, if the case's decision had been so considerably weakened over the years, it was no longer good law and should be reversed.

==Decision==
On June 23, 1997, [[Supreme Court Justice|Justice]] [[Sandra Day O'Connor|O'Connor]] delivered the opinion of the court. The decision was generally divided along ideological lines, with [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[William Rehnquist|Rehnquist]] and Justices [[Antonin Scalia|Scalia]], [[Clarence Thomas|Thomas]], and [[Anthony Kennedy|Kennedy]] joining the majority, and Justices [[John Paul Stevens|Stevens]], [[David H. Souter|Souter]], [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Ginsburg]] and [[Stephen G. Breyer|Breyer]] dissenting.

The Court accepted the respondents' argument that there was no substantial change in factual circumstances. While there was obviously an increase in Board expenditures in maintaining their program, the Court noted that cost increases were not only predicted in Aguilar, they had been practically guaranteed. Furthermore, since the applicable case law had not changed since the Aguilar decision, there was nothing the Court could see as constituting a substantial change in factual circumstances.

On the second argument, the Court again sided with the respondents. It noted that, indeed, five of the Justices had advocated a reconsideration of Aguilar when deciding another case. However, the Court said, this did not necessarily mean there had been a change in their jurisprudence or reasoning, because Aguilar's propriety was not in question when those comments were made. The Court stated that the views of its members, outside of a judgment to this effect, did not constitute a change in Establishment Clause law.

The third argument is given the most examination by the Court. In order to determine if decisions subsequent to Aguilar have actually undermined it or the basis for its findings, the Court examines the cases and the changes in views since that decision was made. The Court notes that it has moved away from the idea that a public employee teaching in a parochial school will necessarily inculcate some of the religious messages inherent in their pervasively sectarian environment. It notes, for example, that in ''[[Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist.]]'' the Court ruled that it was permissible for a deaf student to have a state-sponsored interpreter attend his Catholic high school in the performance of her duties. In this vein, the Court concludes that to consider a public employee's presence in a religious school inappropriate in and of itself would put far too much emphasis on form over substance.

Another change in the Court's approach was that it no longer considered impermissible the use of government money to directly aid the educational functions of a religious school. As long as the money was given without government stipulations as to how it was spent, it was acceptable for such funding to be made available. Citing ''[[Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind]]'', the Court noted that it was not impermissible for the government to give vocational grants, even if the grant would be used to train for some religious job in the future, as long as there was an intervening "genuinely independent and private" choice of where the money would be spent. The Court compared this with a government employee receiving his paycheck, noting that it was certainly acceptable for the government to pay this employee even if it were clear he was going to donate a large portion of it to a religious organization.

The idea of a public employee teaching in a religious school, the Court went on to say, was no longer commonly considered to foster a "symbolic union" between Church and State. Noting that the Dissent believed that, in fact, this did foster such a symbolic union, the Court countered by stating that it cannot be shown that such a symbolic union would vanish once the students and teachers were moved off campus. Taking that reasoning to its logical conclusion, it would forbid Title I entirely, as the union would be unavoidable. Further, the Court rejected the idea that Title I would be financing religious indoctrination if instruction could be conducted on religious campuses; Title I specifically notes that it is designed to "supplement, not supplant" the school's curriculum.

Applying these rationales to the Board's case, the Court determined that the program, previously found unconstitutional in Aguilar, was neither aiding nor inhibiting religion in an impermissible fashion. Reasoning that the aid was distributed according to secular criteria, and offered to all eligible students regardless of school choice, the system of distributing aid was neutral with respect to religion. The program as enacted by the Board did not give any incentive for anyone to alter their religious views.

The Court ultimately overruled Aguilar. It noted that, while [[stare decisis]] is an important doctrine, the Court is not prohibited by precedent to review changes in law or making alterations to previous decisions. It concluded that prevailing Establishment Clause law had changed significantly since Aguilar was decided, making Aguilar no longer good law. In summarizing its position, the Court notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;New York City's Title I program does not run afoul of any of three primary criteria we currently use to evaluate whether government aid has the effect of advancing religion: it does not result in governmental indoctrination; define its recipients by reference to religion; or create an excessive entanglement. We therefore hold that a federally funded program providing supplemental, remedial instruction to disadvantaged children on a neutral basis is not invalid under the Establishment Clause when such instruction is given on the premises of sectarian schools by government employees pursuant to a program containing safeguards such as those present here. The same considerations that justify this holding require us to conclude that this carefully constrained program also cannot reasonably be viewed as an endorsement of religion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In closing, the Court reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals, [[Remand (court procedure)|remand]]ing the case down to them, and giving the lower court instructions to vacate its injunction. Because Aguilar was no longer good law, and the plan constructed by the Board did not create an excessive entanglement with religion, the Court concluded that the Board was entitled to the relief it had sought; moreover, the relief was not simply based on a federal rule, the decision removed the need for the Board to seek the exemption at all.

==Dissent==
Justice [[David H. Souter|Souter]] authored a dissent, in which Justices [[John Paul Stevens|Stevens]], [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Ginsburg]] and [[Stephen G. Breyer|Breyer]] joined.

The dissent was somewhat formalistic in its objections to the majority finding. It stated that the principle of [[stare decisis]] was of too great weight to overrule a previous decision so easily, and that the case presented appeared to be more of a re-hearing of Aguilar than a new proceeding. The Dissent cited the Supreme Court's guidelines surrounding rehearings, accusing the Court of veiling its decision as a "rethinking" instead of a reversal of Aguilar. The Dissent summarized its own position, remarking:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That cause lies in the maintenance of integrity in the interpretation of procedural rules, preservation of the responsive, non agenda setting character of this Court, and avoidance of invitations to reconsider old cases based on "speculat[ions] on chances from changes in [the Court's membership].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In short, the Dissent felt that the ruling in this case was contrary to the integrity and stability of the Court, and did not comport with the apolitical nature of the judiciary.

The '''Bachelor of Business Administration''' ('''BBA''' or '''B.B.A.''') is a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[commerce]] and [[business administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uowdubai.ac.ae/bba-degree-in-dubai/bachelor-of-business-administration|title=Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) Degree - UOWD|author=|date=|website=www.uowdubai.ac.ae}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the degree is conferred after four years of full-time study in one or more areas of business concentrations. In Europe, the degree is conferred after three years of full-time study in one or more areas of business concentrations. The BBA program usually includes general business courses and advanced courses for specific [[Academic major|concentration]]s.

==Structure==
The degree is designed to give a broad knowledge of the functional aspects of a company and their interconnection, while also allowing specialization in a particular area. B.B.A. programs thus expose students to a variety of "core subjects" and generally allow students to specialize in a specific academic area; see aside. 

The degree also develops the student's practical, managerial and communication skills, and business decision-making capability. Many programs incorporate [[training]] and practical experience, in the form of [[case study|case projects]], presentations, [[internship]]s, industrial visits, and interaction with experts from the industry. 

General educational requirements emphasize [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]] (history, economics, and literature). Coverage of mathematics is generally business related, and is often limited to "Quantitative Applications for Business" or, alternatively, courses in [[Business_mathematics#University_level|Calculus for business]] or [[Calculus 101]], and [[business statistics|business-]] or general-statistics.

===BSBA===
The B.S.B.A., '''Bachelor of Science in Business Administration''', is a quantitative variant on the BBA. General educational requirements are relatively mathematics intensive; further, the general focus may also be more analytic, often allowing additional quantitative optional coursework.

==Accreditation==
Particularly in the United States, [[undergraduate]] Business Administration programs may be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]], thus indicating that the school's educational curriculum meets specific quality standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AACSB accredited schools|url=http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/AccreditedMembers.asp|publisher=AACSB|access-date=2010-10-22|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AOGQe8CN?url=http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/accreditedmembers.asp|archive-date=2012-09-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Capitation fee''' refers to an illegal transaction whereby an organisation that provides educational services collects a fee that is more than what is approved by regulatory norms.

==Definition==
In the context of [[India]]n law, a capitation fee refers to the collection of payment by educational bodies not included in the prospectus of the institution, usually in exchange for admission to the institution.

The Prohibition of Unfair Practices in Technical Educational Institutions, Medical Institutions and Universities Bill 2010 defines it as any amount that

*Demanded or charged or collected, directly or indirectly, for, or, on behalf of any institution, or paid by any person in consideration for admitting any person as student in such institution; and which is in excess of the fee payable towards tuition fee and other fees and other charges declared by any institution in its prospectus for admitting any person as student in such institution; or
*Paid or demanded or charged or collected, by way of [[donation]], for, or, on behalf of any institution, or paid by any person in consideration for admitting any person as a student in such institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Prohibition of Unfair Practices in Technical Educational Institutions, Medical Educational Institutions and Universities Act, 2010, Bill No. 56 of 2010 Lok  Sabha|url=http://164.100.24.167/newcommittee/press_release/bill/Committee%20on%20HRD/The%20Prohibition%20of%20Unfair.pdf|format=PDF|website=164.100.24.167|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A submission by counsel, F.S. Nariman, in the P.A. Inamdar case (August 2005) defines capitation fee as "something taken over and above what the institution needs by way of revenue and capital expenditure plus a reasonable surplus.")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prayatna.typepad.com/education/2005/06/what_exactly_do.html|title=Education in India: The definition of capitation fee in the context of education in India|website=Prayatna.typepad.com|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other definitions for capitation fee also include "any amount, by whatever name called, paid or collected directly or indirectly in excess of the fee prescribed...",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tndte.com/ACT%20AND%20REGULATIONS.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-10-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220064648/http://www.tndte.com/ACT%20AND%20REGULATIONS.pdf# |archive-date=2016-12-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "any amount by whatever name called whether in cash or in kind paid or collected or received directly or indirectly in addition to the fees determined"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfhha.org/images/pdf/Hospital_Laws/Kerala_profes_sional_colleges%20_or_institution_ammendment%20act_%202006.pdf|format=PDF|title=No. 11510/Leg.Uni.3/06/Law|website=Rfhha.org|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "any amount, by whatever name called, whether in cash or kind, in excess of the prescribed or, as the case may be, approved, rates of fees..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://bombayhighcourt.nic.in/libweb/acts/1988.06.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-10-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025114132/http://bombayhighcourt.nic.in/libweb/acts/1988.06.pdf# |archive-date=2016-10-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
[[File:Tagore Gandhi.jpg|thumb|Tagore and Gandhi; 'Knowledge without Character' and 'Commerce without Morality' were social sins for Mahatma Gandhi.]]
This practice is widely prevalent in private colleges and universities in India, especially those that grant baccalaureate degrees in engineering, IT and the sciences for which the demand for admissions exceeds the supply, though a number of technical educations has been closing down in recent years and many seats go vacant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livechennai.com/detailnews.asp?newsid=26452 |title=100 engineering colleges to be closed throughout India: Details on Tamil Nadu colleges,AICTE,engineering colleges to be closed ,India,Tamil Nadu, colleges |publisher=Live Chennai |date=2016-05-13 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaeducationreview.com/news/aicte-approves-closure-150-private-colleges |title=AICTE approves closure of 150 private colleges |publisher=India Education Review |date=2012-05-22 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ample evidence to the collection of capitation fee exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Shammi Prabhakar/Mathrubhumi News |url=http://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/kerala/capitation-fee-for-medical-admissions-evidence-out-i-audio-capitation-fee-medical-admissions-1.1392480 |title=Capitation fee for medical admissions: Evidence out I Audio - Kerala-Mathrubhumi Kerala News, Latest Kerala News, Kerala Breaking News, Kerala Politics |publisher=English.mathrubhumi.com |date=2016-09-30 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Correspondent |first=Our |url=http://english.manoramaonline.com/news/kerala/kerala-vigilance-probe-capitation-fee-self-finance-medical-admis.html |title=Capitation fee: Kerala CM orders vigilance probe |publisher=English.manoramaonline.com |date=2016-09-30 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==

Capitation fee has been one of the major contributors to corruption in education and society. Those who complete their course by paying capitation fee are looking for a "return on investment". This attempt to recover the investment fuel unethical practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andrews|first1=Sudhir|title=Human Resources Management|date=2009|publisher=Tata McGraw Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-01-bmj-action-illegal-payments-india.html |title=The BMJ calls for action over illegal payments to India's private medical colleges |publisher=Medicalxpress.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capitation fee has been considered to be one of the reason for the exorbitant hike in healthcare costs and deteriorating medical standards.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeetha D’Silva, journalist, Mumbai |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h106 |title=India’s private medical colleges and capitation fees |publisher=The BMJ |date=2015-01-21 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1150215/jsp/7days/story_3404.jsp |title=Have money, can prescribe |publisher=Telegraphindia.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capitation fee comes as a surprise to the student when the student may have forsaken admission deadlines at other institutions. Choosing not to pay additional fee may even lead to a form of extortion, by withholding the degree from students. Parents often pay so that there is no ill bearing that affects their wards scores or standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Capitation fee: ‘early bird' phenomenon continues |publisher=The Hindu |date=23 May 2011 |url=http://www.hindu.com/2011/05/23/stories/2011052362280300.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130125193611/http://www.hindu.com/2011/05/23/stories/2011052362280300.htm |archivedate=25 January 2013 |accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fee might not be uniformly applied. The donation money is often not accounted, and its usage and allocation are mismanaged and not reported to income tax. In such cases of malpractice, students overpay for substandard education.

Students are also misguided. Some institutions add the capitation fee along with the fee approved by regulatory norms. This combined fee is projected as the actual fee to the students.

==Arguments for and against capitation fees==
[[File:Nalanda.jpg|thumb|[[Nalanda]], an ancient centre for higher learning; 'Speak the Truth', 'Live Righteousness' says the Upanishads ('Sathyam Vada, Dharmam Chara')]]
Capitation fees are generally seen as a main revenue generator that private institutions may charge, which contend that admissions that cater to affordable sections of society somehow affects the overall number of students educated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaeducationreview.com/news/ugc-decide-fee-structure-private-deemed-universities|title=UGC to decide fee structure of private deemed universities - IndiaEducationReview|date=14 March 2011|website=Indiaeducationreview.com|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.indiaeducationreview.com/news/private-universities-in-himachal-to-be-regulated-by-law# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819032529/http://www.indiaeducationreview.com/news/private-universities-in-himachal-to-be-regulated-by-law# |archive-date=2016-08-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government also controls the seat allocation, number and ratio of management, payment and free seats. That limits the institutions' ability to raise money through tuition, leaving institutions in need for money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dolphinlifesciences.com//|title=The Secret of Successful best college |accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ashanet.org/projects-new/documents/678/SupremeCourtJudgementForClauseImplementation.pdf|format=PDF|title=Supreme Court's double whammy for elite schools |website=Ashanet.org|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collecting donations becomes a side effect of the government laws that disallow institutions from setting their fees, but some parents genuinely donate to improve the infrastructure of their wards' college.

The practice of charging capitation fees by various institutions and universities has been subjected to criticism on various grounds. It has been often referred as 'killing of merit'. In its emphatic judgement in the [[Mohini Jain V/s State of Karnataka case]], Supreme Court declared that charging of capitation fee was arbitrary, unfair, and in violation of the fundamental right to equality in Article 14 of the Constitution. The Prohibition of Unfair Practices in Technical Educational Institutions, Medical Institutions and Universities Bill 2010 recognized capitation fee as a cognizable offence.

On the other hand, various private colleges have defended capitation fee on the ground that it avails institutions with funds to reinvest in the institution to impart quality education. V Raghunathan, former professor, IIM-Ahmedabad said "For engineering colleges in most states, the permitted fee for unaided private colleges is in the vicinity of Rs 30,000 per student per annum. Given that even most kindergarten schools charge a higher fee in the cities, one wonders exactly how the private institutions are expected to provide high quality technical education for this fee".&lt;ref name="financialexpress1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/pvt-colleges-defend-capitation-fee/593749/0 |title=Pvt colleges defend capitation fee |publisher=Financialexpress.com |date=2010-03-23 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faking News has written an article 'School Principal elected for the coveted 'Business Person of the Year' award' acknowledging the practices of some of the private schools in India, while also noting that "a school principal winning a business award created unrest among the top business leaders in India".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/india/school-principal-elected-coveted-business-person-year-award-17096|website=Faking News |title=School Principal elected for the coveted 'Business Person of the Year' award |accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, institutions (business schools, engineering colleges, medical colleges) that take capitation fee also receive significant amount of funding from governmental funding agencies like AICTE, DST, UGC and various ministries under central government and state government. The funds support infrastructure ranging from faculty laptops, printers, lab facilities and trading rooms in business schools.

Educational regulatory agencies, at the national level&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ugc.ac.in/pdfnews/1842250_deemedregulation2014.PDF |title=Extraordinary|website=Ugc.ac.in |accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also at the regional level,&lt;ref name="asckerala1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asckerala.org/sites/default/files/MBA%20DIRECTIVES%20ISSUED%20TO%20ALL%20SELF-FINANICNG%20MANAGEMENT%20INSTITUTUES%20ON%2011.05.2015.pdf |title=ADMISSION SUPERVISORY COMMITTEE &amp; FEE REGULATORY COMMITTEE FOR PROFESSIONAL COLLEGES OF KERALA|website=Asckerala.org|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; has mandated that an institution should include the fee in the prospectus. Institutions has been charging fee from students under various categories, that the fee regulatory committee of Karnataka Government has listed 99 different categories&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kea.kar.nic.in/cet2014/NOTICE_FRC.pdf |title=Fee Regulatory Committee of Karnataka Government|website=Kea.kar.nic.in |accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; through which the institutions may be collecting fee from the students. While fee regulatory agencies fix a fee that cover expenses incurred by an institution along with a basic surplus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frctech.ac.in/2011_NewFee/mba_frc.pdf |title=Fee Regulatory Committee (Technical)|website=Frctech.ac.in |accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afrcmp.org/index.php/2015-11-25-08-40-18 |title=Admission &amp; Fee Regulatory Committee|website=Afrcmp.org |accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ojee.nic.in/publicinfo/Handler/FileHandler.ashx?i=File&amp;ii=98&amp;iii=Y |title=Fixation of Fee Structure |accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; many institutions has been charging a fee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/others/thinkingan-mba-knowreal-costs_882184.html |title=Thinking of an MBA?

The National Policy on Education "encourages non-governmental and voluntary efforts in Education, while preventing the establishment of institutions which intend to commercialize Education".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelcontent.aspx?relid=108677 |title=English Releases |publisher=Pib.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; While education is not meant to be a commercial practice, corruption in educational institutions has made a noble endeavor such as education into a "notorious business" that has been repeatedly raided by governmental authorities, resulting in identification and seizure of unaccounted wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-it-dept-seizes-unreported-valueables-worth-over-rs-330-crore-2250360 |title=IT dept seizes unreported valueables worth over Rs 330 crore &amp;#124; Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis |publisher=Dnaindia.com |date=2016-08-30 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
Various renowned and prestigious private schools and colleges across India have been found demanding capitation fee. It was found that sum of Rs 500,000 was allegedly paid by a student through a demand draft to Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering (SVCE), a private college in Pennalur, Sriperumbudur, near Chennai. The incident came into light through a surprise check drive initiated by the government in Tamil Nadu at 142 self-financing engineering colleges in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/07/31/stories/2007073154040600.htm |title=Archive News |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another scam exposed by a popular news channel, Times Now, suggested that Information and Broadcasting Minister for State Jagathrakshakan was allegedly associated with the Shree Balaji Medical College in malpractices in admissions.

==Legal implications==
The Prohibition of Unfair Practices in Technical Educational Institutions, Medical Institutions and Universities Bill 2010 was introduced as a strict measure to bring about the transparency in the educational system regarding the fee structures and other crucial issues. Charging or accepting capitation fee is considered as violation of Provision 6, which prohibits any institution from demanding or accepting capitation fee, directly or indirectly. If found guilty, the institution will be liable to a penalty of up to Rs.5,000,000 and maximum imprisonment for three years. The bill has been criticized by various private institutions essentially for restricting the autonomy of the institution in such matters. J Philip, President, Xavier Institute of Management Education, Bangalore and former director, IIM – Bangalore, said, "The Bill promises to be beneficial. But it also runs the risk of curbing the autonomy and the freedom of institutions and challenge dynamic functioning. Again, it could be misused by students or anyone trying to settle scores".&lt;ref name="financialexpress1"/&gt; However, this bill lapsed, before it became a law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livelaw.in/prashant-bhushan-writes-lodha-committee-systematic-changes-structure-functioning-medical-council/ |title=Prashant Bhushan writes to Lodha Committee for systematic changes in the structure and functioning of Medical Council|website=Livelaw.in |accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media reports indicate that black money in education in India is generating more than 40,000 crores, while black money generation in medical education would be more than 10,000 crores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://praja.in/en/blog/murali772/2016/02/01/business-medical-education |title=The business of medical education &amp;#124; Praja |publisher=Praja.in |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing into black money practices in India has started its probe into the area, which was outside the ambit of SIT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/black-money-sit-set-to-crack-down-on-donations-capitation-fee/article1-1326761.aspx |title=Special team probing black money set to crack down on unaccounted funds in education sector &amp;#124; india |publisher=Hindustan Times |date=2016-04-22 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suggestions to curb practice ==
Concerns have been raised on how capitation fee has been charged in the name of donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/teachers-vow-to-fight-unitary-university-plan-capitation-fee/article128385.ece |title=Teachers vow to fight ‘unitary university’ plan, capitation fee - TAMIL NADU |publisher=The Hindu |date=2009-12-30 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, the Supreme Court appointed Mr Salman Khurshid, former Union Law Minister, as an amicus curiae and asked him to come out with suggestions and methodologies to end this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/424408/sc-names-khurshid-amicus-curiae.html|title=SC names Khurshid amicus curiae|newspaper=[[Deccan Herald]]|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to stringent legal actions, other practices that government can adopt to curb the practice include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thehindu.com/errorpage/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-10-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103165110/http://www.thehindu.com/errorpage/# |archive-date=2018-01-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Audited financial statements of educational institutions, and the 'charitable trusts' that owns these institutions, to be made available in the website of these institutions and trusts, on an annual basis.&lt;ref name="business-standard1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/madras-hc-orders-issue-of-notice-to-it-department-116070401144_1.html|website=Business Standard |title=Madras HC orders issue of notice to IT department |accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Funding organisations like DST, UGC, AICTE, Ministry of Education and other ministries under the central and state governments should stop funding research projects and programmes in institutions taking capitation fee.&lt;ref name="wordpress1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://myfightagainstcapitationfee.wordpress.com/2014/12/07/how-can-we-stop-the-practice-of-capitation-fee/|title=How can we stop the practice of charging capitation fee? Participate, Help, Get Involved|date=7 December 2014|website=Myfightagainstcapitationfee.wordpress.com|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(3) Revoking exemptions/ canceling registrations of these organisations that take capitation fee&lt;ref name="business-standard1"/&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(4) Legal measures against "minority institutions" - linguistic, religious etc. - that operates in an illegal manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2314/stories/20060728003710600.htm|title=Act of promise|website=Frontline.in|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(5) Articles in a leading international medical journal discussing about the capitation fee practices in medical colleges in India suggested that those who complete their courses from capitation fee taking colleges should not be allowed for postings abroad.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h237|title=We need to discuss India’s reliance on private medical colleges|first=Sanjay|last=Nagral|date=22 January 2015|journal=BMJ|volume=350|pages=h237|accessdate=19 October 2017|doi=10.1136/bmj.h237|pmid=25608848}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(6) Instituting a maximum fee limit has been on discussions. For example, Sri Krishna committee has recommended a fee band for professional colleges, with an upper limit for the fee that can be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/aicte-accepts-panel-proposal-on-fee-cap-for-private-institutes/ |title=AICTE accepts panel proposal on fee cap for private institutes|website=Indianexpress.com |accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(7) A centralised fee collection process, with a time-bound mechanism to channelise the collected fee to the institutes.&lt;ref name="wordpress1"/&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(8) A single common entrance exam for each of the courses (medicine, engineering, pharmacy, hotel management, business management, law and other courses).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/editorial/netting-the-best/article8969699.ece|title=Netting the best|date=10 August 2016|website=Thehindubusinessline.com|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.successcds.net/engineeringentranceexam/why-not-a-single-common-entrance-exam-for-engineering-admissions.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024085100/http://www.successcds.net/engineeringentranceexam/why-not-a-single-common-entrance-exam-for-engineering-admissions.html# |archive-date=2016-10-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student Advisory==
[[File:Sacred lotus Nelumbo nucifera.jpg|thumb|Indian Ethos considers education to be a sacred endeavor]]
===Technical Education / Higher Education===
All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), the regulatory body for technical education in India, has called "upon the students, parents and the general public not to pay any capitation fee or any other fee other than that mentioned in the Prospectus of the Institutions for consideration of admission.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aicte-india.org/downloads/notice_prohibition_capitation_fee.pdf|format=PDF|title=Notice : Accepting/Paying Capitation Fees is Strictly Prohibited|website=Aicte-india.org|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; AICTE also mentions that the fee charged from students, including for programs such as PGDM, has to be approved by the fee regulatory committee of the state, and the institute should mention the fee in its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aicte-india.org/downloads/ApprovalProcessHandbook2016-17.pdf |title=All India Council for Technical Education: Approval Process Handbook: (2016 – 2017)|website=Aicte-india.org |accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per AICTE norms, the business schools are not meant to charge a fee higher than what is mentioned in the prospectus. Educational regulatory agencies, at the national level&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; and also at the regional level,&lt;ref name="asckerala1"/&gt; has mandated that an institution should include the fee in the prospectus.

===School education===
Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) states that a school should be run as a service and not as a business and that commercialization does not take place in the school. The Board has mentioned that "No capitation fee or voluntary donations for gaining admission in the school or for any other purpose should be charged/collected in the name of the school. In case of such malpractices, the Board may take drastic action leading to disaffiliation of the school". The school is also punishable with fine which may extend to ten times the capitation fee charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbse.nic.in/Circular%20No.%2002-2016%20dated%2003.06.2016.pdf|format=PDF|title=Adherence to Rules of Affiliation|website=Cbse.nic.in|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBSE has issued notification/s asking schools affiliated to CBSE to mention fee details in the school website, and also in the CBSE website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbse.nic.in/newsite/mdnew.pdf|format=PDF|title=INFORMATION REQUIRED UNDER MANDATORY DISCLOSURE|website=Cbse.nic.in|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbse.nic.in/newsite/md.pdf|format=PDF|title=Extension of date of filing disclosures|website=Cbse.nic.in|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar notifications have been released by regional educational departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schooleducation.tripura.gov.in/sites/default/files/Notification%20on%20Admission.pdf|format=PDF|title=Admission in privately-owned unfunded schools over capitation fees|website=Schooleducation.tripura.gov.in|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CareerScope''' is a standardized and timed interest and [[aptitude]] assessment for education and career guidance.  The system is  used in schools, job training programs, corrections, and in vocational rehabilitation. CareerScope delivers an objective assessment (as opposed to subjective self-report assessment) that is written at a fourth-grade reading level.  The process is student or client self-administered and takes one hour.  The system generates counselor and client/student report versions.  Career recommendations can be generated that are consistent with the Guide for Occupational Exploration, the [[Dictionary of Occupational Titles]], [[Occupational Information Network|O*NET]] as well as the U.S. DOE [[Career Clusters]] and Pathways.  It was developed by the nonprofit Vocational Research Institute, and is based on the US Department of Labor's General Aptitude Test Battery (G.A.T.B.).

== Specific aptitudes assessed by CareerScope ==
* [[General Learning Ability]]
* [[Verbal Aptitude]]
* [[Numerical Aptitude]]

The '''classical education movement''' advocates a form of education based in the traditions of [[Western culture]], with a particular focus on education as understood and taught in [[Classical antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]].  The curriculum and pedagogy of classical education was first developed during the Middle Ages by [[Martianus Capella]] and systematized during the Renaissance by [[Petrus Ramus]]. Capella's original goal was to provide a systematic, memorable framework to teach all human knowledge.  The term "classical education" has been used in Western culture for several centuries, with each era modifying the definition and adding its own selection of topics.  By the end of the 18th century, in addition to the [[Trivium (education)|trivium]] and [[quadrivium]] of the Middle Ages, the definition of a classical education embraced study of literature, poetry, drama, philosophy, history, art, and languages.&lt;ref name="EncycAmerEd1"&gt;{{citation

In the 20th and 21st centuries, it has been used to refer to a broad-based study of the [[liberal arts]] and sciences, as opposed to a practical or pre-professional program.&lt;ref name="EncycAmerEd1"/&gt;

There exist a number of informal groups and professional organizations which undertake the classical approach to classical education in earnest.  Within the secular classical movement, in the 1930s [[Mortimer Adler]] and [[Robert Hutchins]] set forth the "Great Books" of Western civilization as center stage for a classical education curriculum.  Also some public schools (primarily charters) have structured their curricula and pedagogy around the trivium and integrate the teaching of values (sometimes called "character education") into the mainstream classroom.  There are several major societies and associations within the [[classical Christian education]] movement, including the Society for Classical Learning, the [[Association of Classical and Christian Schools]], [http://trinityschools.org/ Trinity Schools], and the CiRCE Institute.

The University of Pennsylvania seal (1894) depicted the [[Trivium (education)|trivium]] as a stack of books providing the foundation for a 'modified' quadrivium of mathematics, natural philosophy (empirical science), astronomy, and theology.

==Three Phases of Modern Education Linked to Classical Education==
Classical education developed many of the terms now used to describe modern education.  Western classical education has three phases, each with a different purpose.  The phases are roughly coordinated with [[developmental psychology|human development]], and would ideally be exactly coordinated with each individual student's development.

* "Primary education" teaches students how to learn.
* "Secondary education" then teaches a conceptual framework that can hold all human knowledge (history), fills in basic facts and practices of major fields of knowledge, and develops the fundamental skills (perhaps in a simplified form) of every major human activity.
* "Tertiary education" then prepares a person to pursue an educated profession such as law, theology, military strategy, medicine, or science.

=== Primary education ===
In classical terms, primary education was the ''[[Trivium (education)|trivium]]'' comprising grammar, logic, and rhetoric.

Logic and rhetoric were often taught in part by the [[Socratic method]], in which the teacher raises questions and the class discusses them.  By controlling the pace, the teacher can keep the class very lively, yet disciplined.

==== Grammar ====
Grammar consists of [[language]] skills such as reading and the mechanics of writing.  An important goal of grammar is to acquire as many words and manage as many concepts as possible so as to be able to express and understand clearly concepts of varying degrees of complexity.  Classical education traditionally included study of [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] to reinforce understanding the workings of languages and allow students to read the [[Classics]] of [[Western culture|Western Civilization]] untranslated.  In the modern renaissance of classical education, this period refers to the upper elementary school years.

==== Logic ====
[[Logic]] ([[dialectic]]) is the process of correct [[reasoning]].  The traditional text for teaching logic was [[Aristotle]]'s [[Aristotelian logic|Logic]].  In the modern renaissance of classical education, this logic stage (or dialectic stage) refers to the junior high or middle school aged student, who developmentally is beginning to question ideas and authority, and truly enjoys a debate or an argument.  Training in logic, both formal and informal, enables students to critically examine arguments and to analyze their own. The whole goal is to train the student's mind not only to grasp information, but to find the analytical connections between seemingly different facts/ideas, to find out why something is true, or why something else is false (in short, reasons for a fact).

==== Rhetoric ====
[[Rhetoric]]al debate and composition are taught to somewhat older (often high school aged) students, who by this point in their education have the concepts and logic to criticize their own work and persuade others.  According to [[Aristotle]] "Rhetoric is the counterpart of dialectic", concerned with finding "all the available means of persuasion."  The student now learns to articulate answers to important questions in his/her own words, to try to persuade others with these facts, and to defend ideas against rebuttal.  The student learns to reason correctly in the Logic stage so that they can now apply those skills to Rhetoric.  Traditionally, students would read and emulate classical poets in learning how to present their arguments well.

=== Secondary education ===
Secondary education, classically the ''[[quadrivium]]'' or "four ways," consist of [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]], [[music]], and [[astronomy]].  Arithmetic is Number in itself, which is a pure abstraction; that is, outside of space and time.  Geometry is Number in space. Music is Number in time, and Astronomy is Number in space and time.&lt;ref name=EncycAmerEd1 /&gt;  Sometimes [[architecture]] was taught alongside these, often from the works of [[Vitruvius]].

History was always taught to provide a context and show political and military development.  The classic texts were from ancient authors such as [[Herodotus]], [[Thucydides]], [[Livy]], [[Cicero]], and [[Tacitus]].

Biographies were often assigned as well; the classic example being [[Plutarch]]'s ''Lives''.  Biographies help show how persons behave in their context, and the wide ranges of professions and options that exist.  As more modern texts became available, these were often added to the curriculum.

In the [[Middle Ages]], these were the best available texts.  In modern terms, these fields might be called [[history]], natural [[science]], [[accounting]] and [[business]], [[fine art]]s (at least two, one to amuse companions, and another to decorate one's domicile), [[military strategy]] and [[military tactics|tactics]], [[engineering]], [[agronomy]], and [[architecture]].

These are taught in a matrix of history, reviewing the natural development of each field for each phase of the trivium.  That is, in a perfect classical education, the historical study is reviewed three times: first to learn the grammar (the concepts, terms and skills in the order developed), next time the logic (how these elements could be assembled), and finally the rhetoric, how to produce good, humanly useful and beautiful objects that satisfy the grammar and logic of the field.

History is the unifying conceptual framework, because history is the study of everything that has occurred before the present.  A skillful teacher also uses the historical context to show how each stage of development naturally poses questions and then how advances answer them, helping to understand human motives and activity in each field.  The question-answer approach is called the "dialectic method," and permits history to be taught Socratically as well.

Classical educators consider the [[Socrates|Socratic]] method to be the best technique for teaching critical thinking.  In-class discussion and critiques are essential in order for students to recognize and internalize critical thinking techniques.  This method is widely used to teach both [[philosophy]] and [[law]].  It is currently rare in other contexts.  Basically, the teacher referees the students' discussions, asks leading questions, and may refer to facts, but never gives a conclusion until at least one student reaches that conclusion.  The learning is most effective when the students compete strongly, even viciously in the argument, but always according to well-accepted rules of correct reasoning.  That is, [[fallacy|fallacies]] should not be allowed by the teacher.

By completing a project in each major field of human effort, the student can develop a personal preference for further education and professional training.

=== Tertiary education ===
Tertiary education was usually an [[apprentice]]ship to a person with the desired profession.  Most often, the understudy was called a "secretary" and had the duty of carrying on all the normal business of the "master." [[Philosophy]] and [[Theology]] were both widely taught as tertiary subjects in Universities, however.

The early biographies of nobles show probably the ultimate form of classical education: a tutor.  One early, much-emulated classic example is of this tutor system is of [[Alexander the Great]], who was tutored by [[Aristotle]].

== Modern interpretations of classical education ==
There exist a number of modern groups and professional organizations which take the classical approach to education seriously, and who undertake it in earnest.

===Classical Christian education===
{{main|Classical Christian education}}
There are several major societies and associations within the [[classical Christian education]] movement, including the Society for Classical Learning, the [[Association of Classical and Christian Schools]], [http://trinityschools.org/ Trinity Schools], the [[Classic Learning Test]], and the CiRCE Institute. 

These schools tend to rely for upon one or more of the visions of classical education represented by [[Dorothy Sayers]] essay "The Lost Tools of Learning",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Sayers, Dorothy  |title=The Lost Tools of Learning |url=http://www.cambridgestudycenter.com/artilces/Sayers1.htm |date=presented at Oxford in 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mortimer Adler's [[Paideia Proposal]], Alfred North Whitehead's ''The Aims of Education,'' or Susan Wise Bauer's ''[https://welltrainedmind.com/ The Well Trained Mind]''.

Most classical Christian schools employ the trivium as three stages of learning which are linked to child development:

* Grammar: The fundamental rules of each subject
* Logic: The ordered relationship of particulars in each subject 
* Rhetoric: How the grammar and logic of each subject may be clearly expressed 

Classical Christian schools vary in their approach to the sectarian integration of Christian thinking. Some schools ask parents to sign a statement of faith before attending, some do not require this of parents but are clear in their sectarian teaching, others are consciously ecumenical. In the 1970s, as a response to the campus riots and sexual revolution of the 1960s, many small classical Catholic colleges began to incorporate, e.g. the [[Thomas More College of Liberal Arts]] in Merrimack, [[New Hampshire]] (est. 1978), [[Thomas Aquinas College]] in Sao Paulo, California, and [[Christendom College]] in Front Royal, Virginia. 

===Classical secular education===
There exist a number of classical schools in the public/secular sector.  These schools, primarily charter schools, also structure their curricula and pedagogy around the trivium and integrate the teaching of values (sometimes called "character education") into the mainstream classroom without involving any particular religious perspectives.

Methods of classical education have also often been integrated into [[homeschooling]], particularly due to the publication of:
"The Well-Trained Mind: A Guide to Classical Education at Home," by Jessie Wise and [[Susan Wise Bauer]] (W.W. Norton, 1999), is a modern reference on classical education, particularly in a homeschool setting. It provides a history of classical education, an overview of the methodology and philosophy of classical education, and annotated lists of books divided by grade and topic that list the best books for classical education in each category.

[[Mortimer Adler]] and [[Robert Hutchins]], both of the [[University of Chicago]] set forth in the 1930s to restore the "Great Books" of Western civilization to center stage in the curriculum. [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] is an example of this type of classical education at the college level.  Although the standard classical works&amp;mdash;such as the [[Harvard Classics]]&amp;mdash;most widely available at the time, were decried by many as out of touch with modern times, Adler and Hutchins sought to expand on the standard "classics" by including more modern works, and by trying to tie them together in the context of what they described as the "Great Ideas," condensed into a "Syntopicon" index and bundled together with a new "five foot shelf" of books as "The [[Great Books of the Western World]]." They were wildly popular during the 1950s, and discussion groups of aficionados were found all over the USA, but their popularity waned during the 1960s, and such groups are relatively hard to find today.  Extensions to the original set are still being published, encompassing selections from both current and older works which extend the "great ideas" into the present age and other fields, including civil rights, the global environment, and discussions of multiculturalism and assimilation.

==Classical Languages==
A more traditional, but less common view of classical education arises from the ideology of the Renaissance, advocating an education grounded in the languages and literatures of Greece and Rome. The demanding and lengthy training period required for learning to read Greek and Latin texts in their original form has been crowded out in most American schools in favor of more contemporary subjects.

The revival of "Classical Education" has resulted in Latin being taught at Classical Schools, but less often Greek.  It is worth noting that the [[Association of Classical and Christian Schools]] does require Latin for accreditation, and [[New Saint Andrews College]] requires both Latin and Greek to graduate with a 4-year degree.  A new group of schools, the [http://www.classicallatin.org Classical Latin School Association], does require Latin to be taught as a core subject.

Such an approach—an education in the [[classics]]—differs from the usual approach of the Classical education movement, but is akin to an education on "The Great Books" followed by [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]].

==Parallels in the East==
In India, the classical education system is based upon the study and understanding of the ancient texts the [[Vedas]], a discipline called [[Vedanga]], and subjects based upon that foundation, referred to as [[Upaveda]] and incorporating medicine ([[Ayurveda]]), music, [[archery]] and other [[martial arts]].

Similarly, in China, the fulcrum of a classical education was the study and understanding of a core canon, the [[Four Books and Five Classics]].

In Taiwan, Classical Chinese takes up 35% of Chinese education in junior high school (7-9th grade, compulsory), and 65% in senior high school (10-12th grade).

He argues for a new synthesis of science, engineering, and the humanities in which there is a balance between what ''can'' be done and what ''ought'' to be done, between human desires and earthly consequences, and between our ever-increasing power to affect our surroundings and the ever-present danger of destroying the ecological and environmental systems which allow us to exist.

'''Computers in the classroom''' include any digital technology used to enhance, supplement, or replace a traditional educational curriculum. As [[computers]] have become more accessible, inexpensive, and powerful, the demand for this technology has increased, leading to more frequent use of computer resources within classes, and a decrease in the student-to-computer ratio within schools.&lt;ref name="Cuban2001"/&gt;

==History==
===Origins===
College campuses used computer [[mainframes]] in education since the initial days of this technology, and throughout the initial development of computers. The earliest large-scale study of educational computer usage conducted for the [[National Science Foundation]] by [[The American Institute for Research]] concluded that 13% of the nation's public high schools used computers for instruction, although non-users still outnumbered users at a ratio of 2 to 1. The study also concluded that computers proved to be very popular with students, and that applications run on early models included sports statistic managers, administration tools, and physics simulators.&lt;ref name="Upi1971"/&gt;

In 1975, [[Apple Inc.]] began donating [[Apple 1]] model computers to schools, and mainframes began to lose their former dominance over academic research.&lt;ref name="Murdock2007"/&gt; Computer usage continued to grow rapidly throughout this era. In 1977, it was estimated that over 90% of students at [[Dartmouth College]] had used computers at some point in their college careers. Walter Koetke, the director of a Lexington, Massachusetts school system commented that, "It's still possible for a student to get through here without using the computer, but he would certainly have to try to do it".&lt;ref name="Haney1977"/&gt;

[[Computer-aided instruction]] gained widespread acceptance in schools by the early 1980s. It was during this period that drilling and practice programs were first developed for exclusive classroom use. Schools became divided over which computer manufacturers they were willing to support, with grade schools generally using Apple computers and high schools preferring [[DOS]] based machines. Hardware shortages in schools became a major issue, leaving many teachers unable to provide enough computers for students to use.&lt;ref name="Johnstone2003"/&gt; Despite this, by 1989 computer usage shifted from being a relative rarity in American public schools, to being present in  nearly every [[school district]].&lt;ref name="Ap1989"/&gt;

===Modern Era===
[[File:Interactive whiteboard at CeBIT 2007.jpg|300px|left|thumb|The interactive whiteboard is an example of computers replacing traditional classroom technology.]]
The early 1990s marked the beginning of modern media technology such as [[CD-ROM]]s as well as the development of modern presentation software such as [[Microsoft PowerPoint]].&lt;ref name="Murdock2007"/&gt; Other computer-based technology including the [[electronic whiteboard]]&lt;ref name="Innovatis2002"/&gt;  and the [[laptop computer]] became widely available to students. In 1990, the [[Methodist Ladies' College, Melbourne|Methodist Ladies' College]] became the first campus to require every student to purchase a laptop. Governments around the world began to take notice of the effectiveness of this policy, and began financial initiatives to significantly increase the use of laptop computers in other colleges as well.&lt;ref name="Johnstone2003"/&gt; In 1996, [[Bill Clinton]] made over $2 billion in grants available in the [https://www2.ed.gov/offices/OESE/SST/tlcf.html Technology Literacy Challenge Fund], a program which challenged schools to make computers available to every student, connected to the outside world, and engaging. This marked a significant increase in the demand for computer technology in many public school systems throughout the globe.

Correlating with the development of modern operating systems like [[Windows 98]] and the continuing support of government funding, the prevalence of educational computer usage boomed during this era. Between 1997 and 1999, the ratio of students to [[multimedia computer]]s decreased from 21 students per machine to less than 10 students per machine. Colleges began creating specialized classrooms designed to provide students with access to the utilization of the most modern technology available. Classrooms such as the "[http://www.cc.gatech.edu/fce/pubs/icse99/node6.html Classroom 2000]" built at Georgia Tech in 1999 which featured computers with audio and video equipment designed to capture detailed recordings of lectures as a replacement for traditional [[note taking]]&lt;ref name="Suggs1999"/&gt; began to become more common. By 2000, the student to computer ratio at some schools in the US decreased to only 5 students per school computer.

As [[collaborative]] classroom environments became mainstream, more schools as a whole began to invest in powerful [[Computer network|networks]] and faster Internet connections. By 2010, many school districts implemented or encouraged "1:1 learning programs" which would ensure that all students in grade school would be provided with a personal laptop.&lt;ref name="Brownjinkins2010"/&gt; Computers have significantly changed traditional teaching methodology into a more "hands-on" approach, with [[Forbes]] predicting that, "Instead of parking themselves in a lecture hall for hours, students will work in collaborative spaces, where future doctors, lawyers, business leaders, engineers, journalists and artists learn to integrate their different approaches to problem solving and innovate together."&lt;ref name="Kembel2010"/&gt;

Experience has shown, however, that excessive use of computers can be detrimental to a student's basic academic skills. The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] has compared average student literacy, numeracy and science skills in 31 countries (considering three large cities in China separately). It also compared the levels of student computer use in those same countries. The study's conclusion, after correcting for social backgrounds and student demographics, was that moderate use of classroom computers produces the best educational outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/education/new-approach-needed-to-deliver-on-technologys-potential-in-schools.htm|title=New approach needed to deliver on technology’s potential in schools|date=15 September 2015|publisher=OECD|accessdate=3 May 2018|quote=Even countries which have invested heavily in information and communication technologies (ICT) for education have seen no noticeable improvement in their performances in PISA results for reading, mathematics or science.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==21st century==
===Demands===
The shift in worldwide computer usage and the need for computer skills in today's workforce have pushed the United States government to create guidelines for educators to ensure that students are prepared to meet the demands of the 21st century. The [http://www.corestandards.org/the-standards Core Curriculum Content Standards] for education are aimed at preparing students with such skills demanded of those entering the 21st century learning environment as well as the 21st century and work environment.

Changes such as this, along with the changes in the ways that 21st century learners communicate, have impacted the ways that classroom computers are utilized. Currently, teachers are tapping into the enhanced abilities of current classroom computer technology by utilizing various [[Web 2.0]] tools to enhance their instruction. Such tools are also being used to extend classroom communication outside of the campus through online collaborative tools. Centered primarily on collaboration and sharing, Web 2.0 computer applications encourage student self-expression; interaction with peers, and opportunity for authentic learning experiences&lt;ref name="brooks2008"/&gt; Through the implementation and integration of Web 2.0 computer technologies into the classroom setting, authentic and meaningful learning experiences are now able to occur in ways that have been previously unimaginable. Currently, the learning that is taking place is not simply about typical concepts or facts as laid out in school curricula. Instead, it is about the process of building connections&lt;ref name="richardson2007"/&gt; As a result, the awareness of the importance and the value of communication is becoming instilled into children. Today, with a single laptop, [[Webcam]], [[Image projector|projector]], and an Internet connection, a teacher can broadcast and begin collaboration with any other classroom. As groups of learners coalesce around shared passions online, they experience something that is difficult to replicate in physical space.&lt;ref name="richardson2007" /&gt;

===Applications===
Classroom computer access to Web 2.0 applications such as online learning communities and interactive educational tools offer a more dynamic learning experience, with direct benefits to students. Web 2.0 technologies that are being utilized within the classroom have made it possible for essential learning to be introduced to students during their elementary levels of education and to be refined through their middle, high school and collegiate experiences. As classroom computer technology is being used for different types of communication—for presentation, for class interaction, and for collaboration,&lt;ref name="driscoll2007"/&gt; students are required to be readers and writers, editors and publishers; and must be willing to collaborate and co-create with others, working closely together to learn even more in the process.&lt;ref name="richardson2007"/&gt; Web 2.0 Interaction involves not only sharing ideas or information with someone else, but also receiving feedback. The collaboration engages groups of people in not only sending and receiving feedback but working together for creating, building, and editing,&lt;ref name="driscoll2007"/&gt; These skills are a necessity for students' futures as they grow and enter the workplace.

The goal of using such computer applications is to increase [[peer-to-peer]] interactions through digital means, in order to replicate real-life 21st century communication skills. One such technology that has gained significant recognition within K-12 education is the [[Weblog]]. Weblogs, or blogs, are frequently accessed on classroom computers due to their positive effects upon students. These online journals are primarily used to support communication in the form of presentation, and they provide a useful tool for class interaction. Weblogs allow students to present their own findings and discoveries to an authentic audience. Receiving feedback about course work not just from your teacher but from your peers, or possibly from the outside world, can be very empowering to students. In their eyes, having the ability to publish their writing on a blog suddenly transforms them into authors and publishers.&lt;ref name="driscoll2007"/&gt; Blogs make students are of careful and conscientious writing. Students are no longer writing for an audience of one. Instead, their words face an audience of their peers as well as countless others whose primary goal is not only to read, but also to provide commentary, feedback and even to critique and criticize their words. By using classroom computers for such means, students become increasingly more cautious and aware of their grammar, spelling and word-choice knowing that they are the authors of a published piece of writing that will reach a wide audience.

Similarly, [[Wikis]] are commonly accessed on classroom computers due to their positive impacts. The collaborative environment that wikis facilitate can teach students much about how to work with others, how to create community, and how to operate in a world where the creation of knowledge and information is increasingly becoming a group effort.&lt;ref name="achterman2006"/&gt; The implementations and uses of wikis range from the development of group-based writing projects, to collaborative note taking, to brainstorming. Teachers can set up wikis for groups of students, giving them the opportunity to all join in on equal footing to give feedback, to make suggestions and changes, and to jot down ideas. With a wiki, everyone is an author of the wiki at the same time.&lt;ref name="driscoll2007"/&gt; Additionally, Wikis afford students the opportunity to express themselves using multiple modalities. Therefore, children who struggle to express themselves through the written word, are now at ease due to ability to insert music, graphics, video, and photos into their writing. With the help of this technology, students who struggle with language are now able to create multimodal compositions, allowing them to communicate meanings that were once inaccessible or not fully expressed through their printed word.&lt;ref name="mcpherson2006"/&gt; These ongoing collaborative efforts also reinforce the notion of careful, contentious writing. Students' words are no longer for an audience of one, but instead for an audience of countless individuals. The awareness of this global reach reminds students to be cautious with grammar, word choice and style as they know that others will be expanding upon their written ideas.

Because of their versatility, [[Podcasts]] are also commonly accessed on classroom computers.  These downloadable, portable files allow listeners to subscribe to digitally recorded audio clips and replay them at their own convenience. Similarly, the use of [[Vodcasts]] has become almost as common, as they allow for students to view digitally recorded video on classroom computers. Accessing Podcasts and Vodcasts on classroom computers allows for [[differentiated instruction]] within the classroom environment. These technologies provide students with the opportunity to learn at their own pace and the freedom to go back whenever possible and as frequently as necessary in order to check their understanding. Podcasts are offering [[ESL]] students, and those with [[learning disabilities]], the chance to review lectures at their own pace for increased comprehension.&lt;ref name="driscoll2007"/&gt; Many [[English language learner|ELL]] and ESL students need additional support with defining commonly used language as well as with the pronunciation of new vocabulary. Other students, such as those with special needs have difficulty reading and reviewing complex texts. Accessing Podcasts and Vodcasts on classroom computers can easily provide helpful tools to address these students' needs.

===Ineffective use===
There is very little evidence that shows that teachers are making proper use of computers in the classroom. [[Intrinsic]] barriers such as a belief in more traditional teaching practices and individual attitudes towards computers in education as well as the teachers own comfort with computers and their ability to use them all result in varying effectiveness in the integration of computers in the classroom. Even with the increased access to computers within education systems the actual use of computers in the class room lacks meaningful activities that involve the students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zelchenko |first1=Peter |title=Exploring Alternatives to Hype |journal=Educational Leadership |date=February 1999 |volume=56 |issue=5 |pages=78–81 |url=http://www.pete.zelchenko.com/files/Zelchenko_Educational_Leadership_02-99.pdf |accessdate=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers also appear to abandon the intended educational uses of the computers purely for communication between staff and parents as well as preparation of more traditional learning materials.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell, C.K., Lauricella, A.R. and Wartella, E., 2014. Factors influencing digital technology use in early childhood education. Computers &amp; Education, 77, pp.82-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1565">In [[mathematics education]], '''concept image''' and '''concept definition''' are two ways of understanding a mathematical concept.

The terms were introduced by {{Harvtxt|Tall|Vinner|1981}}. They define a concept image as such:
:"We shall use the term ''concept image'' to describe the total cognitive structure that is associated with the concept, which includes all the mental pictures and associated properties and processes. It is built up over the years through experiences of all kinds, changing as the individual meets new stimuli and matures."{{sfn|Tall|Vinner|1981|p=152}}
A concept definition is similar to the usual notion of a [[definition]] in mathematics, with the distinction that it is personal to an individual:
:"a ''personal'' concept definition can differ from a ''formal'' concept definition, the latter being a concept definition which is accepted by the mathematical community at large."{{sfn|Tall|Vinner|1981|p=152}}

[[File:Dame School.jpeg|thumb|right|300px|"A New England dame school in old colonial times". 1713. Bettman Archive]]

A '''dame school''' was an early form of a private [[elementary school]] in English-speaking countries. They were usually taught by women and were often located in the home of the teacher.

== Britain ==
[[File:A Dames School (2781207528).jpg|thumb|A dame school; photograph by P. H. Emerson]]
Dame schools were small, private schools run by working class women and occasionally men in their own homes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l-yOAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=Dame+schools+england&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiSvvaa0O3ZAhXuqFkKHdBBCQMQ6AEIRTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Dame%20schools%20england&amp;f=false|title=Women's History: Britain, 1850-1945: An Introduction|last=Purvis|first=June|date=2008-01-28|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135367107|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  References to dame schools can be found from the 16th century onward.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol1/pp213-240|title=The Education of the Working Classes to 1870|last1=Cockburn|last2=King|website=British History on Line|last3=MacDonald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dame schools often had a poor reputation and were often seen as a cheap form of daycare.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The London inspector of the British and Foreign School Society in 1838 wrote that "in the dame schools they cannot teach reading."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1861 the [[Newcastle Commission]] reported:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The number of children whose names ought (in summer 1858 in England and Wales) to have been on the school books, in order that all might receive some education, was 2,655,767.  The number we found to be actually on the books was 2,535,462, thus leaving 120,305 children without any school instruction whatever.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
They looked at the previous year's data and found that 2,213,694 children of the poorer classes were in elementary day schools. But of this number: 
*573,536 were attending private schools, such as Dame schools where a woman provided child care facilities and a little reading, writing and arithmetic in her own home. These failed to give the children an education which would be serviceable to them in after-life. 
*The other 1,549,312 children were attending public elementary day schools belonging to the religious denominations (church schools), but all but 19.3% were under 12, so were in primary departments. Only 300,000 were receiving any form of extended education, which was believed to be essential. 
*As many as 786,202 attend for less than 100 days in the year and can therefore hardly receive a serviceable amount of education
*A large proportion of the teaching was inefficiently done
*"Much, therefore, still remains to be done to bring up the state of elementary education in England and Wales to the degree of usefulness which we all regard as attainable and desirable" {{sfn|Gillard|2017|loc=Section 3}}

Most dame schools largely closed with the implementation of the [[1870 Elementary Education Act]].

== North America ==

In North America, "dame school" is a broad term for a private school with a female teacher during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. The education provided by these schools ranged from basic to exceptional.&lt;ref&gt;Perlmann, Joel, and Robert Margo. Women's work?: American schoolteachers, 1650-1920. Chicago: University of Chicago Press (2001), 9&lt;/ref&gt; The basic type of dame school was more common in [[New England]], where basic literacy was expected of all classes, than in the southern colonies, where there were fewer educated women willing to be teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Tolley, Kimberley. Transformations in schooling: historical and comparative perspectives. New York: Macmillan (2007), 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Motivated by the religious needs of [[Puritan]] society and their own economic needs, some colonial women in 17th century rural New England opened small, private schools in their homes to teach reading and catechism to young children. An education in reading and religion was required for children by the [[Massachusetts School Law of 1642]]. This law was later strengthened by the famous [[Old Deluder Satan Law|Old Deluder Satan Act]]. According to Puritan beliefs, Satan would assuredly try to keep people from understanding the Scriptures, therefore it was deemed that all children be taught how to read. Dame schools fulfilled this requirement if parents were unable to educate their young children in their own home. For a small fee, women, often housewives or widows, offered to take in children to whom she would teach a little writing, reading, basic prayers and religious beliefs. These women received ''"tuition"'' in coin, home industries, alcohol, baked goods and other valuables. Teaching materials generally included, and often did not exceed, a [[hornbook]], primer, [[Psalter]] and [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;Harper, Elizabeth P. "Dame Schools". In Encyclopedia of Educational Reform and Dissent, Thomas Hunt, Thomas Lasley and C D. Raisch, 259-260. SAGE Publications (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Both girls and boys were provided education through the dame school system. Dame schools generally focused on the [[Three R's|four R's of education]]-''Riting, Reading, Rithmetic, and Religion''.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, K. R., &amp; Cooper, J. M. C. (2010). Colonial origins. In L. Mafrici (Ed.), Those who can teach (12th ed.). Boston, MA: Wadsworth Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to primary education, girls in dame schools might also learn sewing, embroidery, and other "graces".&lt;ref&gt;Forman-Brunell, Miriam. Girlhood in America: An Encyclopedia. Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO (2001), 575.&lt;/ref&gt; Most girls received their only formal education from dame schools because of sex-segregated education in common or public schools during the colonial period.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, Hilary J. Schooling citizens: the struggle for African American education in antebellum America. Chicago: University of Chicago Press (2009), 133.&lt;/ref&gt;  If their parents could afford it, after attending a dame school for a rudimentary education in reading, colonial boys moved on to [[grammar school]]s where a male teacher taught advanced arithmetic, writing, Latin and Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Zhboray, Ronald. A fictive people: antebellum economic development and the American reading public. New York: Oxford University Press (1993), 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th and 19th centuries, some dame schools offered boys and girls from wealthy families a "polite education". The women running these elite dame schools taught "reading, writing, English, French, arithmetic, music and dancing".&lt;ref&gt;Greene, Jack and Rosemary Brana-Shute, and Randy J. Sparks, eds. Money, Trade and Power: The Evolution of Colonial South Carolina's Plantation Society. Columbia, SC: University of South Carolina Press (2001), 305.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clinton, Catherine. "Dorothea Dix." In The Reader's companion to American history By, Eric Foner and John Arthur, 289. New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  Schools for upper-class girls were usually called
"[[female seminary|female seminaries]]", "[[finishing school]]s" etc. rather than "dame schools".

The first known school in [[Australia]] was founded in Sydney in 1789 by Isabella Rossen.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=drwGiBT7BUgC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;dq=1789+Isabella+Rosson.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjL9f7hzu3ZAhVGy1MKHaD8BywQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=1789%20Isabella%20Rosson.&amp;f=false|title=Questions of English: Ethics, Aesthetics, Rhetoric, and the Formation of the Subject in England, Australia, and the United States|last=Peel|first=Robin|last2=Patterson|first2=Annette Hinman|last3=Gerlach|first3=Jeanne Marcum|date=2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415191197|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second known school in Australia was founded by Mary Johnson in Paramatta in 1791.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Both women were convicts supervised by clergyman Rev.

&lt;!--much content is still to be added--&gt;'''The Darlington Collection''' is extensive collection of rare documents, maps, and other historical material focusing on early American history, particularly that of [[Western Pennsylvania]]. The original material is housed by the [[Archives Service Center, University Library System, University of Pittsburgh|Archives Services Center]] (ASC) of the library of the [[University of Pittsburgh]] with digitized material available at the Darlington Digital Library. The collection was inherited by Darlington's daughters Mary O'Hara Darlington and Edith Darlington. The donation of the collection was first given to the University of Pittsburgh in 1918. The rest of the collection was donated in 1925.

== Scope of the collection ==
The focus of the collection is on early American history and literature, and also includes rare maps and atlases, works on [[ornithology]] and natural history, and early travel narratives. O'Hara Darlington also contributed his collections of [[Victorian literature]], sporting books, and works of illustrators and caricaturists.&lt;ref name="archivedescript"/&gt; Since the Darlington's donation, the collection has been added to through gifts by other individuals and organizations, particularly its content on the history of Western Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="archivedescript"/&gt;

=== Photographs ===
[[File:Edith Darlington.png | thumb | Edith Darlington]]
The photographic collection icontains 154 photographs taken by [[Edith Dennison Darlington Ammon]] and O'Hara Darlington taken around and in the family home in Guyasuta and the nearby community. The photographs span the years from 1885 through 1888. The photographs are bound in five albums. They recorded family, friends, and leisure activities. These photographs by Edith and O'Hara are noted for their artistic approach to photography.

Edith and O'Hara were active members of the Pittsburgh Amateur Photographers’ Society. The organization also was a social club and was established in May 1885.&lt;!--Also available online is a transcript (pdf) of an article published by The Pittsburgh Leader in 1888 that discusses the society, its members, and their photographic equipment.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Historic Pittsburgh - Image Collections - Darlington Family Photographs | url = http://digital.library.pitt.edu/images/pittsburgh/darlington.html

===  Books ===
The Darlingtons assembled many scrapbooks of materials that they had collected.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;!--=== Manuscripts ===--&gt;
=== Personal and business papers ===
Darlington collected personal letters authored by General James O'Hara to his wife and contemporaries that describe the conditions of Fort Pitt in the 1790s. One of these includes a description of the colonists' interactions with the surrounding Native American tribes. Some papers document the business dealings of  James O'Hara's land from 1785. General James O'Hara's diary is part of the collection and documents his opinions on immigration and glassworks that he built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Guides to Archives and Manuscript Collections at the University of Pittsburgh Library System | accessdate = 2015-11-27  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Atlases and maps ===
[[File:1630MapDarlingtonCollection Pitt.jpg|thumb|left|1630 map by [[Hendrik Hondius I]] that is part of the Darlington Digital Library]]
Included  in the collection are thirty-six rare maps, eight of which show various iterations of the world, including Gerhard Mercator’s world view created in 1613. Some maps are large and unbound. Others are included in rare books. These maps were part of a June 12, 2015 exhibition at [[Hillman Library]] conducted to commemorate the 200th anniversary of William Darlington’s birth on May 1, 1815.

=== Lithographs ===
Historical [[lithograph]]s illustrating buildings and people are part of the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Darlington Digital Library Images  1 to 20  of  36 hits|url=http://images.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/i/image/image-idx?c=darlimg&amp;type=boolean&amp;rgn1=darlimg_fo&amp;view=thumbnail&amp;q1=lithograph|accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Direct instruction''' ('''DI''') is a general term for the explicit teaching of a skill-set using [[lecture]]s or demonstrations of the material to students. A particular subset of '''direct instruction''', denoted by capitalization as '''Direct Instruction''', refers to a specific example of the approach developed by [[Siegfried Engelmann]] and Wesley C. Becker. DI teaches by explicit instruction,&lt;ref name=LearnLab&gt;[http://www.learnlab.org/research/wiki/index.php/Explicit_instruction] Explicit Instruction. LearnLab. Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center. Retrieved 2017-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to exploratory models such as [[inquiry-based learning]]. DI includes [[tutorial]]s, participatory laboratory classes, [[discussion]], [[recitation]], [[seminar]]s, [[workshop]]s, [[observation]], [[active learning]], [[practicum|practica]], or [[internship]]s.

DI relies on a systematic curriculum design, delivered by implementation of a prescribed [[behavioral script]]. On the premise that all students can learn and all teachers successfully teach if given effective training in specific techniques, teachers may be evaluated based on measurable student learning.

In some special education programs, direct instruction is used in [[resource rooms]], when teachers assist with [[homework]] completion and academic remediation.&lt;ref name=Englert &gt;[http://rse.sagepub.com/content/5/2/38.abstract Effective direct instruction practices in special education settings]. Englert, Carol S. ''Remedial &amp; Special Education'', Vol 5(2), Mar-Apr 1984, 38-47&lt;/ref&gt;

== Engelmann's Direct Instruction method and DISTAR ==

The term ''Direct Instruction'' applies specifically to a pedagogical model developed by Siegfried Engelmann in 1964 at the University of Illinois Institute for Research on Exceptional Children.&lt;ref&gt;Engelmann, S. (2007) Teaching Needy Kids in our Backward System.Eugene, OR: ADI Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[DISTAR]] was a specific direct instruction model developed by Siegfried Engelmann and Wesley C. Becker. Engelmann and Becker sought to identify teaching methods that would accelerate the progress of historically disadvantaged elementary school students.&lt;ref&gt;Englemann, S.E.(1968). Relating operant techniques to programming and teaching. ''Journal of School Psychology, 6,'' 89-96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kim &gt;Kim, T. &amp; Axelrod, S. (2005). [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26452612_Direct_Instruction_An_Educators'_Guide_and_a_Plea_for_Action Direct Instruction: An Educators’ Guide and a Plea for Action]. ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 6.(2),'' Page 111-123&lt;/ref&gt;

[[DISTAR]], an acronym for '''D'''irect '''I'''nstruction '''S'''ystem for '''T'''eaching '''A'''rithmetic and '''R'''eading, gained prominence during [[Project Follow Through]], the largest educational study ever conducted in America.

Features of DI include:
*Explicit instruction based on lesson plans, often with specific teacher "scripts."
*[[Ability grouping]]. Students are grouped based on their rate of progress through the program.
*Emphasis on pace and efficiency of instruction. Lessons are designed to bring students to mastery as quickly as possible.
*Frequent assessment.
*Embedded professional development/coaching. Program developers recommend careful monitoring and coaching.

Direct Instruction has been effectively delivered through peers to students with [[learning disabilities]].&lt;ref name=Marchand-Martella &gt;Marchand-Martella, &amp; Martella (2002) [http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bar/3/2/213.pdf&amp;productCode=pa An Overview and Research Summary of Peer-Delivered Corrective Reading]. ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 3 (2),'' 214 -235&lt;/ref&gt;
Peer delivery offers teachers new ways to use the curriculum.&lt;ref name=Marchand-Martella /&gt; The approach has also been examined as a model to assist students in a [[resource room]] with homework completion, bolster executive functioning skills and improve teacher efficiency.&lt;ref name=Englert /&gt;

==Success for All==
Another popular direct instruction approach is the [[Success for All]] program, which uses [[scripted teaching]] to instruct elementary children in [[phonics]] intensive reading instruction program. What the teacher says is carefully scripted in the program. The program was designed by [[Johns Hopkins University]] professor [[Robert Slavin]] in the mid 1980s for failing schools in [[Baltimore]]. The program requires a dedicated 90 minutes of reading instruction each day in which the teacher must follow a pre-ordained lesson plan that has every minute filled with scripted instruction and specific activities designed to teach reading. [[Jonathan Kozol|Kozol]] criticized the program in his book, ''[[The Shame of the Nation]]'', for being excessively dogmatic, utilitarian, and authoritarian.&lt;ref name=Kozol &gt;{{cite book |last=Kozol |first=Jonathan |date=2005 |title=The Shame of the Nation: The Restoration of Apartheid Schooling in America |url= |location=New York |publisher=Random House |page= |isbn=1-4000-5244-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
Debates about the efficacy of DI have raged since before the final results of [[Project Follow Through]] were published; however, there is substantial empirical research supporting its effectiveness. A meta-analysis published by Adams &amp; Engelmann (1996), a chief architect of the DI program, finds a "mean effect size average per study...(as) more than .75, which confirms that the overall effect is substantial."

In some special education programs, it is used in a [[resource room]] with small groups of students. Some research has shown benefit with this model.&lt;ref&gt;Resource Room Teachers' use of Strategies that Promote the Success of Handicapped Students in Regular Classrooms Nancy K. Glomb and Daniel P. Morgan Journal of Special Education, Jan 1991; vol. 25: pp. 221 - 235&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct Instruction is used with students from every population segment (with regard to poverty, culture, and race). In [[Project Follow Through]], the DI model was ranked first in achievement for poor students, students who were not poor, urban students, rural students, [[African American]] students, [[Hispanic]] students, and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] students.  Today, many of the Bureau of Indian Affair's highest-performing schools use Direct Instruction materials. The Baltimore Curriculum Project has many schools with Free and Reduced Lunch Rates above 75% serving student populations that are more than 90% African American. These schools have shown strong achievement gains using Direct Instruction.&lt;ref name=Rebar2007&gt;Rebar, M. (2007).  [http://www.ewu.edu/getset/Academic_Acceleration_G1_TR_2007-1.pdf Academic acceleration in first grade using the Direct Instruction model]. (Report No. 2007-1). Cheney, WA: Eastern Washington University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meta-analysis of 85 [[single-subject design]] studies comparing direct instruction to other teaching strategies found the effects to be substantial for students with learning disabilities;&lt;ref&gt;Swanson, H.L. &amp; Sachse-Lee, C. (2000). A Meta-Analysis of Single-Subject-Design Intervention Research for Students with LD. ''Journal of Learning Disabilities,'' Vol. 33, No. 2, 114-136 {{doi|10.1177/002221940003300201}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, when qualified by IQ and reading levels [[strategy instruction]] (SI) had better effects for the high IQ group. For the low-IQ discrepancy groups, higher effect sizes were yielded for a Combined DI and SI Model when compared to all competing models. With the exception of handwriting, DI's effects were all above .8 (i.e., reading and mathematics).{{Clarify|date=May 2016}}

John Hattie's Visible Learning: A Synthesis of Over 800 Meta-Analyses Relating to Achievement (2009) summarizes the results of four meta-analyses that examined Direct Instruction. These analyses incorporated 304 studies of over 42,000 students. Across all of these students, the average effect size was .59 and was significantly larger than those of any other curriculum Hattie studied.{{Clarify|date=May 2016}}

Direct Instruction is recognized as one of two effective models of comprehensive school reform and, in many cases, can be integrated into a tiered model system{{Definition needed|date=May 2016}} to address students with developing problems.&lt;ref name=Stewart &gt;Stewart, R.M.,  Martella, R.C., Marchand-Martella, N.E. &amp;  Benner, G.J. (2005). [http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ846760.pdf Three-Tier Models of Reading and Behavior]. ''JEIBI''  2 (3), 115-123&lt;/ref&gt; The findings from [[Project Follow Through]], conducted in a variety of selected communities throughout the United States, suggested that Direct Instruction is the most effective model for teaching academic skills and for affective outcomes (e.g., [[self-esteem]]) of children. Recent large-scale studies (1997–2003), such as the Baltimore Curriculum Project, show that it is possible to help schools that are in the lowest twenty percent with respect to academic achievement steadily improve until they are performing well above average. In some cases, school achievement improved from the 16th percentile to above the 90th percentile.&lt;ref name=Rebar2007/&gt;

==Criticism==
One three-year study of methods of teaching reading showed that highly scripted, teacher-directed methods of teaching reading were not as effective as traditional methods that allowed a more flexible approach.&lt;ref name=Ryder2006&gt;Ryder RJ, Burton JL, Silberg A. 2006. Longitudinal study of direct instruction effects from first through third grade. Journal of Educational Research, 99, 3, 179-191&lt;/ref&gt; Urban teachers in particular expressed great concern over the DI's lack of sensitivity to issues of [[poverty]], [[culture]], and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]].&lt;ref name=Ryder2006/&gt;

The former president of the [[National Science Teachers Association]] (NSTA), Anne Tweed, questioned whether direct instruction was the most effective science teaching strategy. In the December 15, 2004 NSTA Reports she concluded that "direct instruction alone cannot replace the in-depth experience with science concepts that inquiry-based strategies provide."&lt;ref&gt;Tweed, a. (2004). [http://www.nsta.org/publications/news/story.aspx?id=50045 Direct Instruction: Is It the Most Effective Science Teaching Strategy?] ''NSTA Reports'', 15 December 2004. Retrieved 5 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics also see DI as a betrayal of the [[humanism|humanistic]], [[egalitarian]] foundations of public education, or as a "canned" or "teacher proof" curriculum deliverable via unskilled teachers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-distance.syr.edu/sdlhuman.html From behaviorism to humanism: Incorporating self-direction in learning concepts into the instructional design process.] In H. B. Long &amp; Associates, New ideas about self-directed learning. Norman, OK: Oklahoma Research Center for Continuing Professional and Higher Education, University of Oklahoma, 1994 (Roger Hiemstra &amp; Ralph Brockett)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, where DI has been used in schools among several remote Indigenous Australians communities in Queensland, DI has been criticised for its high cost in return for at best modest improvements in literacy and numeracy levels, as well as its US-centric theme which is alien to indigenous Australian cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Misty Adoniou.

'''Education in Papua New Guinea''' is managed through '''nineteen [[Provinces of Papua New Guinea|provinces]] and two district organisational units'''. It is tuition-free and attendance is not compulsory. With a literacy rate of 64.2%, [[Papua New Guinea]] has the lowest literacy rate in [[Oceania]].
 
==History==
The first school in Papua New Guinea was established in 1873 by English missionaries. Missionaries would continue providing the basis for education, with [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]] as primary languages. In 1914, as part of World War I, Australia took control over German New Guinea and English became the sole official language.
 
The Currie Commission was created in 1964 to investigate the establishment of higher education in the [[Territory of Papua and New Guinea]]. In 1965 the first university in Papua New Guinea, the [[University of Papua New Guinea]], was established. It was heavily influenced by the Australian education system.&lt;ref&gt; Richard Guy, Toshio Kosuge, Rieko Hayakawa (2000). ''Distance Education in the South Pacific: Nets and Voyages''. Institute of Pacific Studies, University of the South Pacific and Pacific Island Nations Fund, Sasakawa Peace Foundation. p. 115 &lt;/ref&gt;

Education in Papua New Guinea has been tuition-free since 2012, as one of the election promises of the [[People's National Congress (Papua New Guinea)|People's National Congress]].
 
==Provision==
Papua New Guinea's history of missionary education has led to a large part of education being provided by religious schools. The Department of Education has estimated that 29% of the country's lower secondary education is operated by churches. 3% is operated by private international schools, while the remainder is funded by the government.

==Educational Stages==
Papua New Guinea has an A-to-D grading system, with D being a failing grade.

[[File:DibujoPsicologoEducativo3.gif|thumb|320 px|right|Functions of educational psychologist]]

An '''educational psychologist''' is a [[psychologist]] whose differentiating functions may include diagnostic and psycho-educational [[Psychological evaluation|assessment]], [[psychological counseling]] in [[education]]al communities ([[students]], [[teachers]], [[parents]] and academic authorities), community-type psycho-educational intervention, and [[mediation]], coordination, and referral to other professionals, at all levels of the educational system. Many countries use this term to signify those who provide services to students, their teachers, and [[families]] while other countries use this term to signify academic expertise in teaching Educational Psychology.

==Specific facts==
[[Psychology]] is a so well developed discipline that allows different specializations: a) clinical and health psychology, b) work and organizational psychology, c) [[educational psychology]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, R. J. (2006). Educational psychology: The distinctive contribution. ''Educational Psychology in Practice'', 22, 289-304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, T. K., &amp; Wise, P. S. (Eds.). (2007).'' School psychology: Past, present and future (3rd ed.)''. Bethesda, MD: National Association of School Psychologists. {{ISBN|978-0-932955-71-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jimerson, S. R., Oakland, T. D., &amp; Farrel, P. T. (Eds.).(2007). ''The handbook of international school psychology.'' Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. {{ISBN|978-1-4129-2669-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, R., &amp; Alexander, P. A. (Eds.) . (2010). ''Handbook of research on learning and instruction''. New York: Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0-415-80461-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, W. M., &amp; Miller, G. J. (Eds.).(2003). ''Handbook of psychology. Vol. 7: Educational Psychology.'' New Jersey: Wiley. {{ISBN|978-0-471-38406-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wittrock, M. C. (1992). «An empowering conception of educational psychology». ''Educational Psychologist, 27'', 129-141.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, B. J., &amp; Schunk, D. H. (Eds.). (2003). ''Educational psychology: A century of contributions''. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum. {{ISBN|978-0-8058-3682-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; What differentiates an educational psychologist from other psychologists or specialists is constituted by an academic triangle whose vertexes are represented by three categories: [[teachers]], [[students]] and [[curricula]] (see diagram). The use of plural in these three cases assumes two meanings: a) the traditional or official one and b) other more general derived from our information and knowledge society. The plural also indicates that nowadays we can no longer consider the average student or teacher, or a closed [[curriculum]], but the enormous variety found in our students, teachers and curricula. The triangle vertexes are connected by two-directional arrows, allowing four-fold typologies instead of the traditional two-way relationships (e.g., teacher-student).  In this way, we can find, in different educational contexts, groups of good teachers and students (excellent [[teaching/learning]] processes and products), groups of good teachers but bad students, and groups of bad teachers and good students, producing in both cases lower levels of academic achievements. In addition, we can find groups of bad teachers and bad students (school failure).
This specific work of an educational psychologist takes place in different contexts: micro-, meso- and macro-systems.&lt;ref&gt;Bonfenbrenner, U. (1979). ''The ecology of human development: Experiments by nature and design.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-22457-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsystem (educational psychology)|Microsystem]]s refer to family contexts, where atmosphere, hidden curriculum, and expectations and behaviors of all family members determine, to a large extent, the educational development of each student.  The term [[mesosystem]] refers to all variety of contexts found in educational institutions, knowing that different variables such as geographical location, institution marketing or type of teachers and students, etc., can influence the academic results of students. [[Macrosystem]] has a much more general and global nature, leading us, for example, to consider the influence that the different societies or countries have on educational final products. One illustrative example of this level can be the analyses carried out on data gathered by the [[PISA]] reports. This approach would be the essence of educational psychology versus school psychology for many of U.S. educational researchers and for Division 15 of APA.

==Specific functions==
The most noteworthy function is, without a doubt, formal (rather than informal) assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, M. W., Crosby, E. G., &amp; Pearson, J. L. (2001). Role of the school psychologist: Perceptions of school staff. ''School Psychology International, 22'', 64-73.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[evaluation]] involves collecting information, in a valid and reliable way, about the three target groups of the triangle diagram (in their respective contexts): [[teachers]], [[students]] and [[curricula]].&lt;ref&gt;Fernández, J. (2008).'' Assessment of teaching quality: A circular model of evaluation''. Madrid: Editorial Complutense. {{ISBN|978-84-7491-943-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Evaluation is divided in at least two main types: diagnosis (dysfunctions detection such as physical, sensory and intellectual impairments, dyslexia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, pervasive development disorders or autism spectrum disorders) and psycho-educational evaluation (detection of curriculum difficulties, poor school atmosphere or family problems, etc.). [[Evaluation]] implies detection, and, thanks to this, [[Prevention Science|Prevention]].

A second function, very relevant too, is psychological counseling.&lt;ref&gt;Erchul, W. P., &amp; Sheridan, S. M. (Eds.).(2008). Handbook of research in school consultation: Empirical foundation for the field. New York: Erlbaum. {{ISBN|978-0-8058-5336-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This must be directed to: a) [[students]], in their various dimensions (intellectual, obviously, but also their social, affective and professional dimensions); b) [[parents]], as ‘paraprofessionals’ who may implement programs, selected or developed by educational psychologists, to solve their child/student problems; c) teachers, to whom will be offered psycho-educational support to face psychological difficulties that may be found when implementing and adapting [[curricula]] to diversity shown by students; d) academic authorities, who will be helped in their decision-making, regarding the teaching (teaching process) and administrative duties (providing necessary support for students with specific educational needs, decisions about promotion to the next level, and so on).

A third function based on [[communitarian interventions]], with three main facets:  corrective, preventative, and optimizing interventions.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, M. K., Codding, R. S., Boice, C. H., &amp; Lukito, G. (2010). Meta-analysis of acquisition and fluency math interventions with instructional and frustration level skills: Evidence for a skill-by-treatment interaction. ''School Psychology Review'', 39, 69-83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, L. S., &amp; Fuchs, D. (1986). Linking assessment to instructional intervention: An overview. ''School Psychology Review'', 15,318-323.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shonkoff, J., &amp; Meisels, S. J. (Eds.).(2000). Handbook of early childhood intervention (2nd ed.). New York: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-58573-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turner, R. K., &amp; Reese, H. W. (Eds.).(1980). ''Life-span developmental psychology: Intervention''. New York: Academic Press. {{ISBN|978-0-12-704150-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  If disruptive behavior occurs in particular moments and contexts, then a corrective intervention is required. If the aim is [[school violence]] reduction, then tertiary preventive intervention programs are needed. If an early diagnosis of [[learning disability|learning difficulties]] is carried out, then psychologist has undertaken secondary prevention. If the aim is to use psycho-educational programs to prevent future school failure, then a primary preventative intervention program is put into practice.  The complement to all of these interventions is constituted by a series of optimizing activities, meant for the academic, professional, social, family, and personal improvement of all agents in educational community, especially learners.

A fourth function, or specific activity, is referral of those suffering dysfunctions to other professionals, following a previous diagnostic evaluation, with the aim to coordinate future treatment implementation. This coordination will take place with parents, teachers and other professionals, promoting collaboration among all educational agents in order to get the fastest and best case resolution. This second triangle represents the essential components of school psychology, for some European researchers or division 16 of [[American Psychological Association|APA]].

==Academic requirements==
Nowadays it is a specific Doctoral degree (Masters in Scotland) which generally completes the professional preparation of educational psychologists in the UK.  In this Doctorate in Educational Psychology, it is essential a main course which prepares educational psychologists for carrying out diagnostic and psycho-[[educational assessment]], psychological counseling to the educational communities, and all types of communitarian interventions (corrective, preventive and optimizing).  Trainees also develop external professional practices (where the specific coordination, evaluation, counseling, and intervention functions will be put into practice) on placement in local authorities, as well as a final thesis.  Equally, there are a series of theoretical areas that, due to their relevancy in the teaching/learning contexts, should be included, such as: classroom diversity, drug-dependency prevention, developmental disorders, learning difficulties, new technologies applied to educational contexts and data analysis and interpretation. In sum, taking into account all of this, perhaps educational psychologists will be able to meet adequately demands found in different educational institutions.

The following qualifications are required: an undergraduate degree in psychology (or approved postgraduate conversion course which confers the BPS Graduate Basis for Registration) and a BPS accredited Doctorate in Educational Psychology (3 years), or, for Scotland only, an accredited master's degree in Educational Psychology.  Whilst teaching experience is relevant, it is no longer an entry requirement.  At least one year's full-time experience of working with children in educational, childcare or community settings is required and for some courses this may be two years' experience.

To use the term Educational Psychologist in the UK, one will need to be registered with the Health Care Professionals Council (HCPC), which involves completing a course (Doctorate or Masters) approved by the HCPC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prospects.ac.uk/educational_psychologist_entry_requirements.htm|title=Educational psychologist job profile - Prospects.ac.uk|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the United States ===

In the most basic sense of standards for education requirements in the United States an educational psychologist needs a bachelor's degree, followed by a master's degree, and commonly finishing with a PhD or a PsyD in Educational Psychology.&lt;ref name="careersinpsychology.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://careersinpsychology.org/educational-psychologist/|title=How To Become an Educational Psychologist - Education Requirements - Salary Data - CareersinPsychology.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically in California, an educational psychologist candidate (commonly referred to as a LEP or Licensed Educational Psychologist) must have a minimum of a master's degree in psychology or a related field in educational psychology. This degree must be couple with a minimum of three years of experience including two years as a credential school psychologist and one year of supervised professional experience in an accredited school psychology program. After completing these requirements a candidate will then taken an LEP examination to determine if the applicant will be approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbs.ca.gov/app-reg/lep.shtml|title=Licensed Educational Psychologist (LEP) Requirements - California Board of Behavioral Sciences|first=California Board of Behavioral|last=Sciences|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbs.ca.gov/pdf/forms/lep/lepapp.pdf|title=LICENSED EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGIST APPLICATION PACKET}}&lt;/ref&gt; These requirements are widely accepted by the Board of Behavioral Sciences (BBS) and are considered the common standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.child-neuropsychologist.com/html/body_common_questions_child_psychol.html|title=Common Questions|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040610003301/http://child-neuropsychologist.com/html/body_common_questions_child_psychol.html|archivedate=June 10, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; States may have varying standards but the aforementioned standards are a commonality when working in a school setting. Another route that can be followed is in the research field. It involves many of the same standards without the direct link of being in a school setting.&lt;ref name="careersinpsychology.org"/&gt; Those with a research setting are typically employed through a university and do research based on their own and others findings. They may also teach at the university in their respective field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ehe.osu.edu/educational-studies/educational-psychology/|title=Educational Psychology - College of Education and Human Ecology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Job availability/outlook and salary==

The average salary of an educational psychologist is variable dependent on where the psychologist depends on practicing. In a school setting the professional can expect to make around $68,000 a year; however, these professionals are commonly [[school psychologist]]s who have a different background than educational psychologists.&lt;ref name="allpsychologycareers.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpsychologycareers.com/salary/educational-psychologist-salaries.html|title=Educational Psychology Salary &amp; Growth Potential|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An educational psychologist in the research and development field could expect to make around $84,000 per year.&lt;ref name="allpsychologycareers.com"/&gt; Both of these averages could be considered inflated with another source listing the average income of an educational psychologist at around $57,000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indeed.com/salary/Educational-Psychologist.html|title=Educational Psychologist Salary - Indeed.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the resounding majority seems to sit at the $67,000 per year range making the previous income average considerably modest.&lt;ref name="education-portal.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education-portal.com/articles/Educational_Psychology_Job_Description_Salary_and_Outlook.html|title=Educational Psychology: Job Description, Salary and Outlook|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The latest statistics released in 2010 by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] place the median annual salary at $72,540 – showing an increase over a four-year period&lt;ref name="careersinpsychology.org"/&gt; – compared to the median household income of the United States which is currently at $51,000. Educational psychologists make approximately 40% more than the average American, making it an advantageous field of study.&lt;ref&gt;[[Household income in the United States#Median inflation-adjusted .28.22real.22.29 household income]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Job outlook in the field of educational psychology is considered in good condition. By national estimates (US) growth in the field ranges from 11–15% between 2006–2022.&lt;ref name="education-portal.com"/&gt; A report released in 2006 the rate of growth was listed as 15% from 2006–2016,&lt;ref name="allpsychologycareers.com"/&gt; and a separate report released put the growth percentage at a modest 11% from 2012–2022.  Considering most job outlook growth percentages of the time, educational psychologists had the highest in the psychology field and was also considered the highest amongst all occupations at the time of its release in 2006.&lt;ref name="allpsychologycareers.com"/&gt;

'''Electronic assessment''', also known as '''e-assessment''', '''online assessment''', '''computer assisted/mediated assessment''' and '''computer-based assessment''', is the use of [[information technology]] in various forms of assessment such as [[educational assessment]], [[health assessment]], [[psychiatric assessment]], and [[psychological assessment]].&lt;!--wrong- broader definition applies- need sourcing--&gt; This may utilize an [[online]] [[computer]] connected to a [[Computer network|network]]. This definition embraces a wide range of student activity ranging from the use of a [[word processor]] to on-screen [[Test (student assessment)|testing]]. Specific types of e-assessment include multiple choice, online/electronic submission, [[computerized adaptive testing]] and [[computerized classification test]]ing.

Different types of online assessments contain elements of one or more of the following components, depending on the assessment's purpose: formative, diagnostic, or summative.&lt;ref name=Rovai2008&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Rovai A, Ponton M, Baker J |title=Distance Learning in Higher Education: A programmatic Approach to Planning, Design, Instruction, Evaluation, and Accreditation|year=2008|publisher=Teachers College Press|isbn=978-0-8077-4878-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|80–82}} Instant and detailed [[feedback]] may (or may not) be enabled.

In education assessment, large-scale examining bodies find the journey from traditional paper-based exam assessment to fully electronic assessment a long one. Practical considerations such as having the necessary IT hardware to enable large numbers of student to sit an electronic examination at the same time, as well as the need to ensure a stringent level of security (for example, see: [[Academic dishonesty]]) are among the concerns that need to resolved to accomplish this transition.

e-marking is one way that many exam assessment and awarding bodies, such as [[Cambridge International Examinations]], are utilizing innovations in technology to expedite the marking of examinations (see: [[Electronic marking]]). In some cases, e-marking can be combined with electronic examinations, whilst in other cases students will still handwrite their exams with papers scanned in securely and uploaded into an e-marking system.

== Application ==
E-assessment is becoming more widely used by exam awarding bodies, particularly those with multiple or international study centres and those which offer remote study courses. Industry bodies such as [http://www.e-assessment.com The e-Assessment Association] (eAA), founded in 2008, as well as events run by the [http://www.testpublishers.org/ Association of Test Publishers (ATP)] that focus specifically on [http://www.innovationsintesting.org/ Innovations in Testing], represent the growth in adoption of technology-enhanced assessment.

In psychiatric and psychological testing, e-assessment can be used not only to assess [[cognitive]] and [[practical]] abilities but anxiety disorders, such as [[social anxiety disorder]], i.e. [[Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory-Brief form|SPAI-B]]. Widely in psychology.&lt;ref name="Lichtenwald1986" /&gt;{{rp|4–10}} Cognitive abilities are assessed using ''e-testing'' software, while practical abilities are assessed using ''e-portfolios'' or ''simulation'' software.

==Types==
Online assessment is used primarily to measure [[cognitive]] abilities, demonstrating what has been learned after a particular educational event has occurred, such as the end of an instructional unit or chapter. When assessing practical abilities or to demonstrate learning that has occurred over a longer period of time an online portfolio (or [[ePortfolio]]) is often used. The first element that must be prepared when teaching an online course is assessment. Assessment is used to determine if learning is happening, to what extent and if changes need to be made.&lt;ref name=Rovai2008/&gt;{{rp|79}}

===Independent work===

Most students will not complete assignments unless there is an assessment (i.e. [[motivation]]). It is the instructors role to catalyze student motivation. Appropriate [[feedback]] is the key to assessment, whether or not the assessment is graded.&lt;ref name=Rovai2008/&gt;{{rp|83–86}}

===Group work===

Students are often asked to [[group work|work in groups]]. With this brings on new assessment strategies. Students can be evaluated using a collaborative learning model in which the learning is driven by the students and/or a cooperative learning model where tasks are assigned and the instructor is involved in decisions.&lt;ref name=Rovai2008/&gt;{{rp|86–89}}

Pre-testing – Prior to the teaching of a lesson or concept, a student can complete an online pretest to determine their level of knowledge. This form of assessment helps determine a baseline so that when a summative assessment or post-test is given, quantitative evidence is provided showing that learning has occurred.

[[Formative assessment]] – Formative assessment is used to provide feedback during the learning process. In online assessment situations, objective questions are posed, and feedback is provided to the student either during or immediately after the assessment.

[[Summative assessment]] – Summative assessments provide a quantitative grade and are often given at the end of a unit or lesson to determine that the learning objectives have been met.

Practice Testing – With the ever-increasing use of high-stakes testing in the educational arena, online practice tests are used to give students an edge. Students can take these types of assessments multiple times to familiarize themselves with the content and format of the assessment.

[[Statistical survey|Surveys]] – Online surveys may be used by educators to collect data and feedback on student attitudes, perceptions or other types of information that might help improve the instruction.

[[Evaluation]]s – This type of survey allows facilitators to collect data and feedback on any type of situation where the course or experience needs justification or improvement.

[[Performance test (assessment)|Performance testing]] – The user shows what they know and what they can do. This type of testing is used to show technological proficiency, [[reading comprehension]], math skills, etc. This assessment is also used to identify gaps in student learning.

New technologies, such as the [[World Wide Web|Web]], [[Digital data|digital]] video, sound, [[animation]]s, and [[interactivity]], are providing tools that can make assessment design and implementation more efficient, timely, and sophisticated.

==Electronic marking==

Electronic marking, also known as e-marking and onscreen marking, is the use of digital [[educational technology]] specifically designed for marking. The term refers to the electronic marking or [[Grading (education)|grading]] of an exam. E-marking is an examiner led activity closely related to other [[e-assessment]] activities such as e-testing, or e-learning which are student led. E-marking allows markers to mark a scanned script or online response on a computer screen rather than on paper.

There are no restrictions to the types of tests that can use e-marking, with e-marking applications designed to accommodate multiple choice, written, and even video submissions for performance examinations. E-marking software is used by individual educational institutions and can also be rolled out to the participating schools of awarding exam organisations. e-marking has been used to mark many well known high stakes examinations, which in the United Kingdom include  [[A levels]] and [[GCSE]] exams, and in the US includes the [[SAT]] test for college admissions. [[Ofqual]] reports that e-marking is the main type of marking used for general qualifications in the United Kingdom.

===History===
Early adopters include the [[University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate]], (which operates under the brand name [[Cambridge Assessment]]) which conducted its first major test of e-marking in November 2000. Cambridge Assessment has conducted extensive research into e-marking and e-assessment. The syndicate has published a series of papers, including research specific to e-marking such as: Examining the impact of moving to on-screen marking on concurrent validity.&lt;ref name=CA&gt;{{cite web|title=Examining the impact of moving to on-screen marking on concurrent validity|url=http://www.cambridgeassessment.org.uk/Images/208850-examining-the-impact-of-moving-to-on-screen-marking-on-concurrent-validity.pdf|website=Cambridge Assessment|publisher=Cambridge Assessment|accessdate=15 October 2015|ref=CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[International Baccalaureate]] implemented e-marking. In 2012, 66% of nearly 16 million exam scripts were "e-marked" in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=RM group=Education&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rise of Onscreen Marking Around The World|url=http://rmresults.co.uk/the-rise-and-rise-of-onscreen-exam-marking-around-the-world|website=RM Results|publisher=RM Results|accessdate=15 October 2015|ref=Rise of onscreen marking}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ofqual]] reports that in 2015, all key stage 2 tests in the United Kingdom will be marked onscreen.

In 2014, the [[Scottish Qualifications Authority]] (SQA) announced that most of the National 5 question papers would be e-marked.&lt;ref name=SQA&gt;{{cite web|title=An Introduction to E-marking|url=https://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/files_ccc/IntroductioneMarkingMFI.pdf|website=SQA|publisher=SQA|accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, the [[Odisha]] state government in India announced that it planned to use e-marking for all Plus II papers from 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State government of India announces that it would be using e-marking for all streams from 2016|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/E-marking-for-all-streams-from-2016/articleshow/47510723.cms|website=Times of India|publisher=Times of India|accessdate=15 October 2015|ref=TI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Process ===

e-marking can be used to mark examinations that are completed on paper and then scanned and uploaded as digital images, as well as online examinations. Multiple-choice exams can be either marked by examiners online or be automarked where appropriate. When marking written script exams, e-marking applications provide markers with the online tools and resources to mark as they go and can add up marks as they progress without exceeding the prescribed total for each question.

All candidate details are hidden from the work being marked to ensure anonymity during the marking process. Once marking is complete, results can be uploaded immediately, reducing both the time spent by examiners posting results and the wait time for students.

The e-marking FAQ&lt;ref&gt;[http://rmresults.co.uk/e-marking/e-marking-frequently-asked-questions E-marking: Frequently Asked Questions]&lt;/ref&gt; is a comprehensive list of answers to frequently asked questions surrounding e-marking.

==Advantages==
It has also been noted that in regards to university level work, providing electronic feedback can be more time-consuming than traditional assessments, and therefore more expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Assignments 2.0: The role of social presence and computer attitudes in student preferences for online versus offline marking|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096751615000457|journal = The Internet and Higher Education|date = 2016-01-01|pages = 8–16|volume = 28|doi = 10.1016/j.iheduc.2015.08.002|first = Rachel|last = Grieve|first2 = Christine R.|last2 = Padgett|first3 = Robyn L.|last3 = Moffitt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Lichtenwald investigated the test validity and test reliability of either personal computer administration or a paper and pencil administration of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised (PPVT-R). His project report included a review and analysis of the literature of pre mid 1980s E-assessment systems.&lt;ref name=Lichtenwald1986&gt;Lichtenwald, Terrance G. (1986). "[http://wwwresearchgate.net/profile/Terrance_Lichtenwald2/publicationsArticle: An Investigation of the validity, reliability, and acceptance by children of a microcomputer administration of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised (PPVT-R)]," http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED558200.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of the literature of E-assessment from the 1970s until 2000 examined the advantages and disadvantages of E-assessments.&lt;ref&gt;Millsap, Claudette M. (2000). "[https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc2621/m2/1/high_res_d/Dissertation.pdf] by CM Millsap – 2000 Comparison of Computer Testing versus Traditional Paper and Pencil"&lt;/ref&gt;

A detailed review of the literature regarding advantages and disadvantages of E-assessment for different types of tests for different types of students in different educational environment from childhood through young adulthood was completed in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Blazer, Christie (2010). "[http://www. U.S. Department of .files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED544707.pdf Information Capsule]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050411000000/http://www./ |date=April 11, 2005 }}," Research Services, Volume 0918.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic dishonesty===
[[Academic dishonesty]], commonly known as cheating, occurs in all levels of educational institutions. In traditional classrooms, students cheat in various forms such as hidden prepared notes not permitted to be used or looking at another student's paper during an exam, copying homework from one another, or copying from a book, article or media without properly citing the source. Individuals can be dishonest due to lack of time management skills, pursuit for better grades, cultural behavior or a misunderstanding of plagiarism.&lt;ref name="Rovai2008"/&gt;{{rp|89}}

Online classroom environments are no exception to the possibility of academic dishonesty. It can easily be seen from a student's perspective as an easy passing grade. Proper assignments types, meetings and projects can prevent academic dishonesty in the online classroom.&lt;ref name=Rovai2008/&gt;{{rp|89–90}}  However, online assessment may provide additional possibilities for cheating, such as hacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dawson|first1=Phillip|title=Five ways to hack and cheat with bring-your-own-device electronic examinations|journal=British Journal of Educational Technology|date=17 February 2015|doi=10.1111/bjet.12246|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjet.12246/abstract;jsessionid=592CEB526962F62C7EC35EE6724F0D51.f02t03?userIsAuthenticated=false&amp;deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two common types of academic dishonesty are [[identity fraud]] and [[plagiarism]].

Identity fraud can occur in the traditional or online classroom. There is a higher chance in online classes due to the lack of proctored exams or instructor-student interaction. In a traditional classroom, instructors have the opportunity to get to know the students, learn their writing styles or use proctored exams. To prevent identity fraud in an online class, instructors can use proctored exams through the institutions testing center or require students to come in at a certain time for the exam. Correspondence through the phone or video conferencing techniques can allow an instructor to become familiar with a student through their voice and appearance. Another option would be personalize assignments to students backgrounds or current activities. This allows the student to apply it to their personal life and gives the instructor more assurance the actual student is completing the assignment. Lastly, an instructor may not make the assignments heavily weighted so the students do not feel as pressured.&lt;ref name=Rovai2008/&gt;{{rp|89–90}}

Plagiarism is the misrepresentation of another person's work.  It is easy to copy and paste from the internet or retype directly from a source. It is not only the exact wordage, but the thought or idea.&lt;ref name=Rovai2008/&gt;{{rp|90}}
It is important to learn to properly cite a source when using someone else's work.

==Interoperability==
To assist sharing of assessment items across disparate systems, global standards such as the IMS Question and Test Interoperability specification ([[QTI]]) have emerged.

'''Elementary school''' is a [[school]] for [[student]]s in their first school years, where they get [[primary education]] before they enter [[secondary education]]. The exact ages vary by country. In the United States, elementary schools usually have 6 grades with pupils aged between 6 and 12 years old, but the age can be up to 10 or 14 years old as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Snyder|first1=Thomas D.|last2=Hoffman|first2=Charlene M.|title=Digest of Education Statistics 2001|date=2001|publisher=National Center for Education Statistics|location=Institute of Education Sciences, Washington|page=7, fig. 1|url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2002/2002130.pdf|accessdate=19 August 2017|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, the age of pupils in elementary school ranges from 6 to 12, after which the pupils enter [[Middle_school#Japan|junior high school]]. 

Elementary school is usually only one part of [[compulsory education]], especially in Western countries.

'''''Engel v. Vitale''''', 370 U.S. 421 (1962), was a [[landmark decision|landmark]] [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court ruled that it is unconstitutional for state officials to compose an official [[school prayer]] and encourage its recitation in [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]].

==Background==
The state of New York approved a piece of legislation which encouraged students to start their school days with the Pledge of Allegiance and a prayer with the text:
{{quote|Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee, and we beg Thy blessings upon us, our parents, our teachers and our country. Amen.&lt;ref name=uscourts&gt;{{cite web |title=Facts and Case Summary - Engel v. Vitale |url=http://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/facts-and-case-summary-engel-v-vitale}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|370|421|1962|name=Engel v. Vitale|pin=422}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The case was brought by a group of families of public school students in [[New Hyde Park, New York|New Hyde Park]] from the [[Herricks Union Free School District]] who sued the school board president William J. Vitale, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Engel-v-Vitale|title=Engel v. Vitale {{!}} law case|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1961/468|title=Engel v. Vitale|last=|first=|date=|website=Oyez|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The families argued that the voluntary prayer written by the state board of regents to "Almighty God" contradicted their religious beliefs. Led by Steven I. Engel, a [[Jewish]] man,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/plaintiff-in-1962-landmark-school-prayer-case-reflects-on-his-role |title=Plaintiff in 1962 landmark school-prayer case reflects on his role |author=David L. Hudson Jr., First Amendment scholar |date=August 26, 2005 |website=www.firstamendmentcenter.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the plaintiffs sought to challenge the constitutionality of the state's prayer in school policy.  They were supported by groups opposed to the school prayer including rabbinical organizations, [[Ethical Culture]], and Jewish organizations. The acting parties were not members of one particular religion; despite being listed in the court papers as an atheist, plaintiff Lawrence Roth later denied that and described himself as religious but disagreed with prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Susan Dudley|last1=Gold|title=Engel V. Vitale: Prayer in the Schools|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qc5Ove6xYf8C&amp;pg=PA16|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|date=2006 |isbn=9780761419402|via=Google Books|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Of the five plaintiffs, three were Jews and two referred to themselves as "spiritual" people who did not belong to any one organized religion. The cited book flatly contradicts this, so commenting out for now; I'll get back to refactoring later.--&gt;

The plaintiffs argued that opening the school day with such a prayer violates the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] ([[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|as applied to the states]] through the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]), which states, in part, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion".&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Const. Amend. I.&lt;/ref&gt; The governments of twenty-two states submitted an ''[[amicus curiae]]'' brief to the Supreme Court urging affirmance of the [[New York Court of Appeals]] decision that upheld the constitutionality of the prayer.&lt;ref&gt;The ''amicus curiae'' brief was submitted by the attorneys general of Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Maryland, Mississippi, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas, and West Virginia. {{ussc|370|421|1962|name=Engel v. Vitale}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[American Jewish Committee]], the [[Synagogue Council of America]], and the [[American Ethical Union]] each submitted briefs urging the Court to instead reverse and rule that the prayer was unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Opinion of the Court==
In a 6–1 decision, the Supreme Court held that reciting government-written prayers in public schools was unconstitutional, violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ussc|370|421|1962|name=Engel v. Vitale}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his opinion for the Court, [[Hugo Black|Justice Black]] explained the importance of separation between church and state by giving a lengthy history of the issue, beginning with the 16th century in England. He noted that prayer is a religious activity by the very nature of  being a prayer, and that prescribing such a religious activity for school children violates the [[Establishment Clause]].

The Court rejected the defendant's arguments that students were not asked to observe any specific established religion, that the traditional heritage of the nation was religious, and that the prayer was voluntary. The Court held that the mere promotion of a religion is sufficient to establish a violation, even if that promotion is not coercive. The Court further held that the fact that the prayer is vaguely-enough worded not to promote any particular religion is not a sufficient defense, as it still promotes a family of religions (those that recognize "Almighty God"), which still violates the Establishment Clause.

==Subsequent developments==
Since its decision, ''Engel'' has been the subject of intense debate. It has become considered one of the Court's "liberal" decisions alongside decisions such as its sequel, ''[[Abington School District v. Schempp]]'',  ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'', ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'' and its sequel, ''[[in re Gault]]'', ''[[Eisenstadt v. Baird]]'',  ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', ''[[Miller v. California]]'' and ''[[Mapp v. Ohio]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Smith|first1= Christopher |last2= Hensley|first2= Thomas |date= Fall 1994|title= Unfulfilled Aspirations: The Court-Packing Efforts of Presidents Reagan and Bush|url= |journal= Albany Law Review|volume= 57|issue= |pages= 1111, 1130|doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been criticized for its broadness in holding that a showing of coercion is not required to demonstrate an Establishment Clause violation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=McConnell, Michael|last1=W.|title=Coercion: The Lost Element of Establishment|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmlr/vol27/iss5/7/|journal=William &amp; Mary Law Review|date= 1986 |issn=0043-5589|volume=27|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Graham |first1=Kristin |title=The Supreme Court Comes Full Circle: Coercion as the Touchstone of an Establishment Clause Violation |journal=Buffalo Law Review |date=Winter 1994 |volume=42 |pages=147,158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Engel'' has been the basis for several subsequent decisions limiting government-directed prayer in school. In ''[[Wallace v. Jaffree]]'' (1985), the Supreme Court ruled Alabama's law permitting one minute for prayer or meditation was unconstitutional. In ''[[Lee v. Weisman]]'' (1992), the court prohibited clergy-led prayer at middle school graduation ceremonies. ''Lee v. Weisman'', in turn, was a basis for ''[[Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe|Santa Fe ISD v. Doe]]'' (2000), in which the Court extended the ban to school-organized ''student''-led prayer at high school football games.

The '''English Language School Board''' or '''ELSB''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] school district in [[Prince Edward Island]].

The English Language School Board is an [[English Canadian|Anglophone]] district operating 58 public schools (gr. 1-12) in [[Prince County, Prince Edward Island|Prince County]], [[Queens County, Prince Edward Island|Queens County]] and [[Kings County, Prince Edward Island|Kings County]]. It maintains offices in [[Stratford, Prince Edward Island|Stratford]] and [[Summerside, Prince Edward Island|Summerside]] with the current enrollment at approximately 20,000 students and 2,300 teachers.

The English Language School Board was created in 2012 when [[Eastern School District]] and [[Western School Board]] were merged. The Board took office on January 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New School Board|url=http://www.gov.pe.ca/eecd/index.php3?number=news&amp;dept=&amp;newsnumber=8407&amp;lang=E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 5, 2015 the [[Government of Prince Edward Island|PEI Government]] announced that it will be dissolving the English Language School Board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-education-administration-announcement-1.3305353 PEI English Language School Board to be dissolved]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Excellence''' is a talent or quality which is unusually good and so surpasses ordinary [[Requirement|standard]]s. It is also used as a standard of [[performance]] as measured e.g. through [[economic indicator]]s.

In modern public relations and [[marketing]], "excellence" is frequently criticized as a [[buzzword]] that tries to convey a good impression often without imparting any concrete information (e.g. "center for excellence in ...", "business excellence", etc.).

==History==
The Ancient Greeks had a concept of ''[[arete (excellence)|arete]]'' which meant an outstanding fitness for purpose.  This occurs in the works of [[Aristotle]] and [[Homer]].

Another related concept was ''[[eudaimonia]]'' which was the happiness which resulted from a life well-lived, being prosperous and fulfilled.  The equivalent concept in Muslim philosophy is ''[[ihsan]]''.

==Practice makes perfect==
Studies have shown that the most important way to achieve excellent performance in fields such as sport, music, professions and scholarships is to [[practice (learning method)|practice]].  Achievement of excellence in such fields commonly requires approximately 10 years of dedication, comprising about 10,000 hours of effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lj19AAAAMAAJ |title=The road to excellence: the acquisition of expert performance in the arts and sciences, sports, and games |author=Karl Anders Ericsson |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-8058-2231-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:F1 in Schools Competition Track.jpg|thumb|F1 in Schools Competition Track]]
'''''F1 in Schools''''' is an international STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) competition for school children (aged 11&amp;ndash;18), in which groups of 3–6 students have to design and manufacture a miniature car out of the official F1 Model Block using [[Computer-aided design|CAD]]/[[Computer-aided manufacturing|CAM]] design tools.  The cars are powered by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cartridges and are attached to a track by a nylon wire. They are timed from the moment they are launched to when they pass the finish line by a computer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Sunday/LearningCurve/2073683/Article/index_html The New Straits Times Online] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111021436/http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Sunday/LearningCurve/2073683/Article/index_html |date=11 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cars have to follow extensive regulations, in a similar fashion to Formula 1 (e.g. the wheels of the car must be in contact with the track at all times). The cars are raced on a 20m long track with two lanes, to allow two cars to be raced simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalog.pitsco.com/about/news/item.aspx?art=363&amp;bhcp=1 |title=Pitsco Ideas &amp; Solutions: About Us: F1 in Schools Announces Winners |publisher=Catalog.pitsco.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Software called F1 Virtual Wind Tunnel was designed specifically for the challenge.  F1 Virtual Wind Tunnel or F1 VWT uses [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD) to simulate air resistance on the "cars" made in the [[Computer-aided design|CAD]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080424133011/http://www.denford.ltd.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=30 Denford Website - Virtual Wind Tunnel]&lt;/ref&gt;

The competition is currently operational in over 40 different countries.&lt;ref name = "blogspot"&gt;{{cite web|author=The F1 In Schools Technology Challenge |url=http://f1inschools.blogspot.com |title=F1 In Schools International News |publisher=F1inschools.blogspot.com |date=2008-03-20 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The competition was first introduced in the UK in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f1inschools.us/ |title=Welcome to F1 in Schools! |publisher=F1inschools.us |date= |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The competition's aim is to introduce younger people to engineering in a more fun environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f1inschools.co.uk/about.asp |title=About |publisher=F1 in Schools |date=2012-10-25 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The competition is held annually, with Regional and National Finals.  The overall winners of the National Finals are invited to compete at the World Finals, which are held at a different location each year, usually held in conjunction with a Formula One Grand Prix. In the UK competition; there are 3 classes of entry. Formula One Class aimed at 11-to-19 year olds, Rookie Class aimed at 11-to-15 year olds from new schools and The Jaguar Primary School Challenge aimed at 5-to-11 year olds.

{{As of|2018}}, the F1 in Schools World Champions are Horizon, Australia.

The F1 in Schools World Record was set in 2016 by [https://infinitudeaustralia.github.io/ Infinitude] and is 0.916 seconds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Australia set new record at F1 in Schools World Finals |url=https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/headlines/2016/10/australia-set-new-world-record-at-f1-in-schools-world-finals.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This time was set using a Launch Energy Recovery System (LERS), which has since been banned.

Union Racing International were the first team to beat the one second barrier and set a new World Record at the World Finals 2015 in Singapore of 0.977 seconds.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;http://www.f1inschools.com/latest-news/GermanyUSAcollaborationteam/&lt;/ref&gt; However, one year later [https://infinitudeaustralia.github.io/ Infinitude] from Australia broke the world record with a time of 0.916 seconds. The other teams to have broken the 1 second barrier were XLR8 from India (0.918 s), Infinite Racing from Greece, Fast Payce from Australia and Aeolus Racing from Greece.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018|reason=Further Reading and Study}}

After safety issues concerning the use of extended canister chambers coupled with the Launch Energy Recovery System (LERS), the controversial device was banned globally from the 2017 World Finals season onwards.

Denford Ltd. unveiled a new track and timing system that debuted at the 2017 World Finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ALL NEW FOR 2017! F1 in Schools Race System Powered by Denford |url=http://website.denford.ltd.uk/news/new-2017-f1-schools-race-system-powered-denford/}}&lt;/ref&gt; All components are now manufactured in-house, resulting in a lower overall cost in comparison to the Pitsco produced track that it succeeds. The track's launching mechanism has had numerous reliability issues since it's introduction.

In 2018, the competition's logo was updated to incorporate [[Formula One]]'s updated logo. Consequently, the Bernie Ecclestone World Champions trophy was replaced, with the new World Champions trophy incorporating the new logo.

== Aspects of the competition ==

'''Specification judging'''
Specification judging is a detailed inspection process where the race car is assessed for compliance with the F1 in Schools Technical
Regulations. Scrutineering is conducted within the confines of parc fermé where judges use a series of specially manufactured gauges and accurate measuring tools to check the car's compliance.

All of the rules and regulations season can be found at F1 in Schools website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.f1inschools.co.uk/download--13.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Engineering judging'''
The scheduled engineering judging interview session focuses on the application of CAD CAM analysis, CAD data organisation, orthographic drawing, 3D render and use of CNC machining. This is an informal interview where judges ask the team to demonstrate their CAD / CAM work and query teams on what they have done.

'''Portfolio &amp; Pit Display Judging'''

Each team of students is required to produce an enterprise portfolio, engineering portfolio as well as a pit display. The portfolios are A3 size and should contain information about the team, their car design and manufacturing process, marketing techniques, project management, teamwork and team identity.
Teams are given an area to set up a pit display which is judged alongside their design portfolio by a panel of judges.

'''Verbal presentation judging'''
In advance of the competition, teams prepare a timed verbal presentation to present to a panel of judges, outlining their project. Teams usually use a PowerPoint presentation as a visual aid when presenting to the judges.
The length of the verbal presentation varies depending on the level of the competition. At World Finals Level teams are required to prepare a 10-minute presentation.

'''Racing'''

Teams race their cars against each other on the official 25 metre F1 in Schools competition track. Points are awarded for reaction time racing as well as manual launch racing.

== Defining car features ==
Although regulations vary from regional to national to world finals, the basic features, resembling a real F1 car, are consistent.

'''Front and rear wing'''

The cars have to include a front and a rear wing that does not cover the wheels if seen from the side or the top in the technical drawing. The front wing can not cover the wheels higher than 15mm relative to the track surface.

'''Cartridge chamber'''

The cars feature a chamber to hold the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cartridge. It has to be parallel to the track surface.

'''Wheels'''

The cars have to include four wheels with a given scope of width and radius that are in contact with the surface of the track at all times. The wheels must be entirely visible in the technical drawing from the right or left side and from the top. There is a 15mm long exclusion zone behind the width of the wheels.

'''Car body'''

The cars have to incorporate a virtual cargo hotizontal to the track surface in between the centre of the axis of the wheels. This renders many "catamaran" designs insufficient. Cars have to be symmetrical to a vertically oriented reference plane. Cars also have to feature side boxes big enough to hold the F1 in schools decal similar to Formula 1.

Generally, Regional Champions are invited to compete at their country's National Final, with the in-country organising authority inviting other teams to the National Final through the use of wildcards. The National Champions are invited to represent their country at the World Finals. The in-country organiser is permitted to invite up to 3 other teams to the World Final, one of which is generally either an in-country or international collaboration team. The winner receives the crystal Bernie Ecclestone F1 in Schools World Trophy. The World Final podium places and Best Engineered Car are outlined below.

There are two forms of gamification, structural with no subject matter changes, and the altered content method that adds subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The gamification of learning and instruction: Game-based methods and strategies for training and education.|last=Kapp|first=Karl|publisher=Pfeiffer|year=2012|isbn=9781118096345|location=San Fransciso|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Games applied in learning can be considered as serious games, where the learning experience is centred around serious stories. The serious story is "impressive in quality" and "part of a thoughtful process" to achieve learning goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lugmayr|first1=Artur|last2=Suhonen|first2=Jarkko|last3=Hlavacs|first3=Helmut|last4=Montero|first4=Calkin|last5=Suutinen|first5=Erkki|last6=Sedano|first6=Carolina|title=Serious storytelling - a first definition and review|journal=Multimedia Tools and Applications|date=2016|doi=10.1007/s11042-016-3865-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In educational contexts, examples of desired student behaviour which gamification can potentially influence include attending class, focusing on meaningful learning tasks, and taking initiative.&lt;ref name=B&amp;L2013&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Borys|first1=Magdelena|last2=Laskowski|first2=Maciej|title=Implementing game elements into didactic process: A case study|conference=Management, Knowledge and Learning International Conference|date=19–21 June 2013 |location=Zadar, Croatia |pages=819–824 |url=http://www.toknowpress.net/ISBN/978-961-6914-02-4/papers/ML13-326.pdf |isbn=9789616914024 |accessdate=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RiseoftheRhythm Screenshot.png|thumb|The gamified music learning platform, ''Rise of the Rhythm'']]

Distinguishable from [[Game Based Learning|game-based learning]], gamification of learning does not involve students in designing and creating their own games, or in playing commercially produced [[video games]]. Within game-based learning initiatives, students might use ''[[Gamestar Mechanic]]'' or ''[[GameMaker]]'' to create their own video game, or play ''[[Minecraft]]'', for example, where they explore and create 3D worlds. In these examples, along with games such as ''Surge'' for [[PlayStation]] and ''[[Angry Birds]]'', the learning agenda is encompassed within the game itself.{{Original research inline|date=August 2016}}

Some authors contrast gamification of learning with game-based learning, claiming that gamification occurs only when learning happens in a non-game context, such as a school classroom, and when a series of game elements is arranged into a system or "game layer" which operates in coordination with the learning in that regular classroom.&lt;ref name=2012W /&gt; Others include games that are created to induce learning.&lt;ref&gt;Kapp (2012), p. 200: "result of the brainstorming process ... is the creation of a gamification design document outlining the design of the game ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ward Game Screen Shot.png|thumb|A gamified unit in a high school English course designed to teach the novel, ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'']]

== Game elements that can facilitate learning ==
Some elements of games that may be used to motivate learners and facilitate learning include:
* Progress mechanics (points/badges/leaderboards, or PBL's)
* [[Narrative]] and characters 
* Player control
* Immediate feedback
* Opportunities for collaborative problem solving
* Scaffolded learning with increasing challenges
* Opportunities for mastery, and leveling up
* Social connection

When a classroom incorporates the use of some of these elements, that environment can be considered "gamified". There is no distinction as to how many elements need to be included to officially constitute gamification, but a guiding principle is that gamification takes into consideration the complex system of reasons a person chooses to act, and not just one single factor.&lt;ref name=2012W /&gt; Progress mechanics, which need not make use of advanced technology, are often thought of as constituting a gamified system&lt;ref name=2012K /&gt; However, used in isolation, these points and opportunities to earn achievements are not necessarily effective motivators for learning.&lt;ref name=2012K /&gt; Engaging video games which can keep players playing for hours on end do not maintain players' interest by simply offering the ability to earn points and beat levels. Rather, the story that carries players along, the chances for players to connect and collaborate with others, the immediate feedback, the increasing challenges, and the powerful choices given to players about how to proceed throughout the game, are immensely significant factors in sustained engagement. Business initiatives designed to use gamification to retain and recruit customers, but do not incorporate a creative and balanced approach to combining game elements, may be destined to fail.&lt;ref name=Gartner2012&gt;{{cite press release |last1=Pettey |first1=Christy |last2=van der Meulen |first2=Rob |date=27 November 2012 |title= Gartner Says by 2014, 80 Percent of Current Gamified Applications Will Fail to Meet Business Objectives Primarily Due to Poor Design |url=http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2251015 | publisher=Gartner, Inc. |accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in learning contexts, the unique needs of each set of learners, along with the specific learning objectives relevant to that context must inform the combination of game elements to shape a compelling gamification system that has the potential to motivate learners.&lt;ref name=2013H&amp;S&gt;{{Cite report |last1=Huang |first1=Wendy Hsin-Yuan |last2=Soman |first2=Dilip |date= 10 December 2013 |title= A Practitioner’s Guide To Gamification Of Education |url= http://inside.rotman.utoronto.ca/behaviouraleconomicsinaction/files/2013/09/GuideGamificationEducationDec2013.pdf |series=Research Report Series Behavioural Economics in Action |publisher=Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto |accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A system of game elements which operates in the classroom is explicit, and consciously experienced by the students in the classroom. There is no hidden agenda by which teachers attempt to [[coercion|coerce]] or trick students into doing something. Students still make autonomous choices to participate in learning activities. The progress mechanics used in the gamified system can be thought of as lighting the way for learners as they progress,&lt;ref name=AmyJo /&gt; and the other game mechanics and elements of game design are set up as an immersive system to support and maximize students' learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Hamari|first1=J.|last2=Koivisto |first2=J. |last3=Sarsa |first3=H. |title=Does gamification work?

Game designer [[Jane McGonigal]] characterizes video game players as urgent optimists who are part of a social fabric, engaged in blissful productivity, and on the lookout for epic meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McGonigal|first=Jane|title=Reality is broken: Why games make us better and how they can change the world|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Press|location=New York|isbn=9780143120612}}&lt;/ref&gt; If teachers can successfully organize their classrooms and curriculum activities to incorporate the elements of games which facilitate such confidence, purpose and integrated sense of mission, students may become engrossed in learning and collaborating such that they do not want to stop.

Referring to how video games provide increasingly difficult challenges to players, game designer [[Amy Jo Kim]] has suggested that every educational scenario could be set up to operate this way.&lt;ref name=AmyJo&gt;{{cite web|last=Kim|first=Amy Jo|title=Smart Gamification|url=http://www.slideshare.net/amyjokim/smart-gamification|publisher=SlideShare|accessdate=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Kim|first=Amy Jo|title=The Player's Journey|conference=Gamification 2013|publisher=University of Waterloo Stratford Campus |date=20 December 2014 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82m29j1JhWI|accessdate=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This game mechanic which involves tracking players' learning in the game, and responding by raising the difficulty level of tasks at just the right moment, keeps players from becoming unnecessarily frustrated with tasks that are too difficult, as well as keeps players from becoming bored with tasks that are too easy. This pacing fosters continued engagement and interest which can mean that learners are focused on educational tasks, and may get into a state of [[Flow (psychology)|flow]], or deeply absorbed in learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Csikszentmihalyi|first=Mihaly|title=Finding Flow: The psychology of engagement with everyday life|year=1997|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465024117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==
Three key ways in which a classroom, [[course (education)|course]], or unit can be gamified are through changing the language, adapting the [[Grading (education)|grading]] process, and modifying the structure of the learning environment. With regard to language, instead of referring to academic requirements with the typical associated terms, game-like names may be used instead. For example, making a course presentation might be referred to as "embarking on a quest", writing an exam might be "defeating monsters", and creating a prototype might be classed as "completing a mission". In terms of grading, the grading scheme for a course might be adapted to make use of [[Experience point|experience points (XP)]] as opposed to letter grades. Each student can begin at level one with zero points; as they progress through the course, completing missions and demonstrating learning, they earn XP. A chart can be developed to illustrate how many XP is required to earn a letter grade. For example, earning 1500 XP might translate to a C, while 2000 would earn a B, and 2500, an A. Some teachers use XP, as well as health points (HP) and knowledge points (KP) to motivate students in the classroom, but do not connect these points with the letter grades students get on a report card. Instead these points are connected with earning virtual rewards such as badges or trophies.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The structure of a course or unit may be adapted in various ways to incorporate elements of gamification; these adaptations can affect the role of the student, the role of the teacher, and role of the learning environment. The role of a student in a gamified environment might be to adopt an [[avatar (computing)|avatar]] and a game name with which they navigate through their learning tasks. Students may be organized into [[team]]s or [[guild]]s, and be invited to embark on learning quests with their fellow guild members. They may be encouraged to help other guild members, as well as those in other guilds, if they have mastered a learning task ahead of others. Students tend to express themselves as one of the following game-player types; player (motivated by extrinsic rewards), socialiser (motivated by relatedness), free spirt (motivated by autonomy), achiever (motivated by mastery) and philanthropist (motivated by purpose).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gameification: A Simple Introduction and a Bit More|last = Marczewski|first = Andrej|publisher = Self-published on Amazon Digital Services|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The role of the teacher is to design a gamified application, embedding game dynamics and mechanics that appeal to the target group (i.e. students) and provide the type of rewards that are attractive to the motivation of the majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url =https://journals.ala.org/ltr/article/view/5632 |title = Designing Gamification in the Right Way|last = Kim|first = Bohyun|date = 2015|journal = Library Technology Reports |volume=51 |issue=2 |access-date=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is important teachers know their students so they are able to best design a gamififed program that not only interests the students but also one in which matches the specific learning goals that hit on elements of knowledge from the curriculum.&lt;ref name=2012K /&gt; The teacher also needs to responsibly track student achievements with a web-based platform, such as [[Open Badges]], the WordPress plug-in GameOn or an [[online spreadsheet]]. The teacher may also publish a [[leaderboard]] online which illustrates the students who have earned the most XP, or reached the highest level of play. The teacher may define the parameters of the classroom "game", giving the ultimate learning goal a name, defining the learning tasks which make up the unit or the course, and specifying the rewards for completing those tasks. The other important role of the teacher is to provide encouragement and guidance for students as they navigate the gamified environment.

The role of a gamified learning environment may be structured to provide an overarching narrative which functions as a context for all the learning activities. For example, a narrative might involve an impending [[zombie (fictional)|zombie]] attack which can be fended off or a murder mystery which can be solved, ultimately, through the process of learning. Learning is the focus of each gamified system. Sometimes the narrative is related to the content being learned, for example, in the case of a disease outbreak which can be stopped through learning biology. In some cases the narrative is unrelated, as in a case of music students who learn to play pieces as the means to collectively climb up to the top of a mountain, experiencing various challenges and setbacks along the way. Other ways in which gaming elements are part of the role of the learning environment include theme music played at opportune times, a continuous feedback loop which, if not instantaneous, is as quick as possible, a variety of individual and collaborative challenges, and the provision of choice as to which learning activities are undertaken, how they will be undertaken, or in which order they will be undertaken.{{Original research inline|date=August 2016}}

== Corporate learning ==
Learning and training employees in corporates and organizations can be applied to improve performance, employee satisfaction, align employee with mandatory protocols, and [[on-the-job training]]. Corporate learning has significantly changed in the past two decades. Similarly to formal education institutions, corporates and organizations now realize that effective learning can no longer be limited to the classroom. Different methods to deliver content are constantly introduced in the market as well as new ways to track employees in their learning path. 
Gamification for corporate learning is used to improve the employee experience and achieve better knowledge retention rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ELearning and Enterprise Gamification - The Perfect Match|url=http://www.gameffective.com/wp-content/uploads/E-Learning-White-paper.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; These applications often feature the same common gamification elements – points, badges, leaderboards, animations, and different game narratives. Content is delivered to employees using [[microlearning]] to achieve better learning, while tracking systems can help managers see where specific employees are struggling. 
Gamified corporate learning can be achieved using a separate learning system – LMS (learning management system), or it can be embedded inside commonly used software, to achieve on the spot training and be featured in an employee’s daily routine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=BERSIN|first1=JOSH|title=The Disruption of Digital Learning: Ten Things We Have Learned|url=http://joshbersin.com/2017/03/the-disruption-of-digital-learning-ten-things-we-have-learned/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Without adding extra gaming elements to the classroom, schooling already contains some elements which are analogous to games.&lt;ref name=L&amp;H2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=J.|last2=Hammer |first2=J. |title=Gamification in education: What, how, why bother?|journal=Academic Exchange Quarterly|year=2011|volume=15 |issue=2 |url=http://www.gamifyingeducation.org/files/Lee-Hammer-AEQ-2011.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516005227/http://www.gamifyingeducation.org/files/Lee-Hammer-AEQ-2011.pdf |archive-date=2011-05-16}}{{unreliable source?|reason=Academic Exchange Quarterly is on Beall's list of questionable journals; it may provide only token peer-review, if any|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the 1700s, school has presented opportunities for students to earn marks for handing in assignments and completing exams,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reisner|first=Edward H.|title=Nationalism and Education since 1789: A Social and Political History of Modern Education|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924032694006|date=1922|publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pierson |first=George |title=C.

Knopf|location=New York|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are a form of reward points. Since the early 1900s, with the advent of [[psychoanalytic theory]], reward management programs were developed and can still be seen in schools. For example, many teachers set up reward programs in their classrooms which allow students to earn free time, school supplies or treats for finishing homework or following classroom rules.&lt;ref name=2011D /&gt;

While some have criticized the term "gamification" then, as simply a new name for a practice that has been used in education for many years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kirk|first1=Terry|last2=Harris |first2=Christopher|title=It's all fun and games in the library|journal=Knowledge Quest|year=2011|volume=40|issue=1|pages=8–9|url=http://www.ala.org/aasl/sites/ala.org.aasl/files/content/aaslpubsandjournals/knowledgequest/docs/GuestEdColumn_SeptOct2011.pdf|accessdate=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; gamification does not refer to a one-dimensional system where a reward is offered for performing a certain behaviour. The gamification of learning is an approach which recently has evolved, in coordination with technological developments, to include much larger scales for gameplay, new tools, and new ways to connect people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Rughiniş|first=Răzvan|title=Gamification for productive interaction: Reading and working with the gamification debate in education|conference=Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies (CISTI)|year=2013|issn=2166-0727|publisher=IEEE|location=Lisboa}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term gamification, coined in 2002, is not a one-dimensional reward system. Rather, it takes into consideration the variety of complex factors which make a person decide to do something; it is a multifaceted approach which takes into consideration psychology, design, strategy, and technology.&lt;ref name=2012W&gt;{{cite book|last1=Werbach|first1=Kevin|last2=Hunter|first2=Dan|title=For the Win: How Game Thinking Can Revolutionize Your Business|year=2012|publisher=Wharton Digital Press|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-1613630235}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for the popularization of the term "gamification" is that current advancements in technology and, in particular, mobile technology have allowed for the explosion of a variety of gamification initiatives in many contexts. Some of these contexts include the [[Starbucks]] and [[Shoppers Drug Mart]] loyalty programs, location-based check-in applications such as [[Foursquare]], and mobile and web applications and tools that reward and broadcast healthy eating, drinking, and exercise habits, such as [[Fitocracy]], [[BACtrack]] and [[Fitbit]]. These examples involve the use of game elements such as points, badges and leaderboards to motivate behavioural changes and track those changes in online platforms. The gamification of learning is related to these popular initiatives, but specifically focuses on the use of game elements to facilitate student engagement and motivation to learn. It is difficult to pinpoint when gamification, in the strict sense of the term, came to be used in educational contexts, although examples shared online by classroom teachers begin appearing in 2010.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

== Effectiveness ==
The research of Domínguez and colleagues about gamifying learning experiences suggests that common beliefs about the benefits obtained when using games in education can be challenged. Students who completed the gamified experience got better scores in practical assignments and in overall score, but their findings also suggest that these students performed poorly on written assignments and participated less on class activities, although their initial motivation was higher. The researchers concluded that gamification in e-learning platforms seems to have the potential to increase student motivation, but that it is not trivial to achieve that effect, as a big effort is required in the design and implementation of the experience for it to be fully motivating for participants. On the one hand, qualitative analysis of the study suggests that gamification can have a great emotional and social impact on students, as reward systems and competitive social mechanisms seem to be motivating for them. But quantitative analysis suggests that the cognitive impact of gamification on students is not very significant. Students who followed traditional exercises performed similarly in overall score than those who followed gamified exercises. Disadvantages of gamified learning were reported by 57 students who did not want to participate in the gamified experience. The most frequent reason argued by students was 'time availability'. The second most important reason were technical problems. Other reasons were that there were too many students and that they had to visit so many [[web page]]s and applications at the university that they did not want to use a new one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Domínguez |first1=Adrián |last2=Saenz-de-Navarrete |first2=Joseba |last3=de-Marcos |first3=Luis |last4=Fernández-Sanz |first4=Luis |last5=Pagés |first5=Carmen |last6= Martínez-Herráiz |first6=José-Javier |title=Gamifying learning experiences: Practical implications and outcomes |journal=Computers &amp; Education |year=2013|volume=63 |pages=380–392 |doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2012.12.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another field where serious games are used to improve learning is health care. Petit dit Dariel, Raby, Ravaut and Rothan-Tondeur investigated the developing of serious games potential in nursing education. They suggest that few nursing students have long-term exposure to home-care and community situations. New pedagogical tools are needed to adequately and consistently prepare nurses for the skills they will need to care for patients outside acute care settings. Advances in information and communications technologies offer an opportunity to explore innovative pedagogical solutions that could help students develop these skills in a safe environment. Laboratory simulations with high fidelity mannequins, for example, have become an integral element in many health care curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petit dit Dariel|first1=Odessa J.|last2=Raby |first2=Thibaud |last3=Ravaut|first3=Frédéric |last4= Rothan-Tondeur|first4=Monique |title=Developing the Serious Games Potential in Nursing Education|year=2013|journal=Nurse Education Today|volume=33|issue=12|pages=1569–1575|doi=10.1016/j.nedt.2012.12.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent systematic review found evidence suggesting that the use of simulation mannequins significantly improved three outcomes integral to clinical reasoning: knowledge acquisition, critical thinking and the ability to identify deteriorating patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lapkin|first1=Samuel|last2=Levett-Jones|first2=Tracy |last3=Bellchambers|first3=Helen |last4=Fernandez|first4=Ritin |title=Effectiveness of Patient Simulation Manikins in Teaching Clinical Reasoning Skills to Undergraduate Nursing Students: A Systematic Review|journal=Clinical Simulation in Nursing|volume=6|issue=6|year=2010|pages=e207–e222|doi=10.1016/j.ecns.2010.05.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the study of Mouaheb, Fahli, Moussetad and Eljamali an American version of a serious game was investigated: [[Virtual U]]niversity. Results showed that learning using this serious game has educational values that are based on learning concepts advocated by constructivist psycho-cognitive theories. It guarantees intrinsic motivation, generates cognitive conflicts and provides situated learning. The use of Virtual University allowed the researchers to identify the following key points: from its playfulness combined with video game technologies, the tool was able to motivate learners intrinsically; the simulation game also recreates learning situations extremely close to that of reality, especially considering the complexity, dynamism and all of the interrelations and interactions that exist within the university system. This is a major educational advantage by encouraging 1) an intense interaction that generates real cognitive or socio-cognitive conflicts, providing a solid construction of knowledge; 2) an autonomy in the learning process following a strong metacognitive activity; 3) an eventual transfer of acquired skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mouaheb|first1=Houda|last2=Fahli|first2=Ahmed |last3=Moussetad|first3=Mohammed |last4= Eljamali |first4=Said |title=The Serious Game: What Educational Benefits?|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|volume=46|year=2012|pages=5502–5508|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.06.465|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187704281202201X|accessdate=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Gamification of learning has been criticized for its use of extrinsic motivators, which some teachers believe must be avoided since they have the potential to decrease intrinsic motivation for learning (see [[overjustification]]). This idea is based on research which emerged first in the early 1970s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deci|first=Edward|title=Effects of externally mediated rewards on intrinsic motivation|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1971|volume=18|issue=1|pages=105–111|doi=10.1037/h0030644}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deci|first1=Edward|last2=Koestner|first2=Richard |last3=Ryan|first3=Richard M. |title=Extrinsic Rewards and Intrinsic Motivation in Education: Reconsidered Once Again|journal=Review of Educational Research|year=2001|volume=71|issue=1|pages=1–27|doi=10.3102/00346543071001001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and has been recently made popular by [[Daniel H. Pink|Daniel Pink]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pink|first=Daniel|title=Drive: the surprising truth about what motivates us|year=2009|publisher=Riverhead|isbn=9781594484803}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teachers may not acknowledge that extrinsic motivators are already at work in a typical classroom, or they may wish to minimize extrinsic motivation.

Some teachers may criticize gamification for taking a less than serious approach to education. This may be a result of the historical distinction between work and play which perpetuates the notion that the classroom cannot be a place for games, or a place for fun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Keith|title=Work and Leisure in Industrial Society|journal=Past and present|year=1964|volume=30|issue=1|pages=50–66|doi=10.1093/past/30.1.96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schultz Colby|first1=Rebecca|last2=Colby|first2=Richard|title=A Pedagogy of Play: Integrating Computer Games into the Writing Classroom|journal=Computers &amp; Composition|year=2008|volume=25|issue=3|pages=300–312|doi=10.1016/j.compcom.2008.04.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Game play has also suffered under misconceptions of being easy, irrelevant to learning, and applicable only to very young children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rieber|first=Lloyd P.|title=Seriously Considering Play: Designing Interactive Learning Environments Based on the Blending of Microworlds, Simulations, and Games |journal=Educational Technology Research and Development |year=1996 |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=43–58 |doi=10.1007/bf02300540}}&lt;/ref&gt; These negative impressions of play may translate into suspicions regarding the value of game elements which promote fun and a sense of playfulness within a learning context.{{Original research inline|date=August 2016}}

Teachers who criticize the gamification of learning might feel that it is not worth their time to implement gaming initiatives, either because they themselves are stretched thin with the number of responsibilities that they already have,&lt;ref name=L&amp;H2011 /&gt; or because they fear that the curriculum might not be covered if any time is spent dedicated to anything other than engagement with that curriculum. Gamification of learning has been also criticized as ineffective for certain learners and for certain situations. It should be noted that proponents of gamification have never claimed that gamification is such a panacea, recognizing that it is not an appropriate strategy to motivate every learner in every circumstance{{Citation needed|reason=Please elaborate on types of learners and circumstances in which gamification may not be an appropriate strategy.|date=March 2017}}.&lt;ref name=2012K /&gt; Videogame theorist [[Ian Bogost]] has criticized gamification for its tendency to take a simplistic, manipulative approach which does not reflect the real quality of complex, motivational games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bogost|first=Ian|title=Gamification is Bullshit|url=http://www.bogost.com/blog/gamification_is_bullshit.shtml|accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educational scenarios which purport to be gamification, but only make use of progress mechanics such as points, badges and leaderboards are particularly susceptible to such criticism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9265">'''Gender mainstreaming in teacher education policy''' refers to efforts to examine and change processes of policy formulation and implementation across all areas and at all levels from a gender perspective so as to address and correct existing and emerging disparities between men and women. It is a strategy to change the process of policy design, implementation and evaluation by taking into consideration the gender specific and often diverse needs, priorities, interests and values of differently positioned men and women.&lt;ref&gt;True, J. 2003. Mainstreaming Gender in Global Public Policy. ''International Feminist Journal of Politics'', Vol. 5, No. 3, pp. 368–396.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, [[gender mainstreaming]] is about awareness of the existence of gender disparities and their causes and implications, and ensures that they are addressed at each phase of the policy cycle or policy analyses and revision.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002316/231646e.pdf|title=A Guide for Gender Equality in Teacher Education Policy and Practices|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100069-0|location=|pages=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context and process ==
There are two situations in which [[Teacher Education Institutes]] (TEIs) can find themselves. One is that they may not have a policy at all, and the other is that they might have a policy but that the policy may not have addressed gender issues or mainstreamed gender. In the  first instance, TEIs need to develop a gender-responsive policy for their institutions, and in the second they need to review their policy from gender perspectives. In this part of the module we will look at mainstreaming gender in the different phases of the policy cycle: Problem Definition, Agenda Setting, Policy Formulation, Policy Legitimation and Policy Evaluation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Problem definition ===
Problem definition explains the nature, scope and significance of the problem within the context of the current policy environment (international, regional and national legal and policy commitments). During this stage, a problem is identified and examined, and possible solutions are explored through research and discussion. It requires that the delineation of the policy problem is as clear as possible in order to help identify problems of [[teacher education]], as well as gender issues that are relevant at the national level and that can be addressed by formulating policy in their applicable institutions. Whatever the problem identified, the TEI must be seen from the perspective of [[gender equality]]. In order to do this, the first step is to investigate gender disparities in different areas and levels among students, teaching staff and administration. In this regard, some of the following areas are analyzed:
* Number of male and female teaching staff
* Number of male and female teaching staff by qualification
* Number of male and female staff holding key administrative positions
* Number of male and female trainees
* Number of male and female trainees by academic performance&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Agenda setting ===
Once a problem is identified, a decision has to be reached as to whether it requires a policy intervention. If so, efforts will be made to bring the matter and its possible solutions to the attention of relevant staff and decision-makers to make it a policy-requiring issue. Already existing policies, strategies, programmes or offices may address some of the problems. The institute may need to review the policies, programmes or office structures, and also introduce a gender equality perspective to strengthen them further and address the problems more effectively. If there are gender-responsive policies available, TEIs may need to come up with a more concrete implementation plan, while other problems may require a policy initiative. In such a situation, the problem could be presented as a policy agenda to the relevant authority for consideration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Defining goals and outputs ===
After defining the problem, and once the problem is considered as requiring policy intervention, goals are identified in order to address the problem. In the context of TEIs, the goals could range from increasing enrolment, addressing quality, acquiring resources, and mitigating high staff turnover to narrowing gender disparities. Policy goals need to state gender concerns specifically and visibly. Different performance indicators and sex-disaggregated data need to be considered to capture the gender dimensions. The stated goals need to take into consideration the different gender related barriers women and men face to benefit equally and equitably.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Status of Women Canada. 1998. ''Gender-based analysis. A guide for policy-making''. Ottawa, Status of Women Canada. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.paci&lt;/nowiki&gt; cwater.org/user les/ le/IWRM/Toolboxes/gender/gender_based_analysis. pdf (Accessed 3 July 2014.)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Policy formulation ===
Policy formulation has two basic stages: determining the policy options and selecting the preferred option. This process may involve debate over alternative policy choices, which takes into account both the benefits and costs of each policy option. The policy alternatives are derived from a research process that investigates the problem in an in-depth manner using either primary or secondary sources of data or both. In collecting information all data, all relevant individuals and organizations have to be consulted, and all numerical data have to be disaggregated by sex. This stage may also entail analysis of existing policies. Based on the information gathered, the preferred policy options are presented, which will enable the policy objective to be effectively and efficiently reached.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Policy legitimation ===
For a policy to obtain a legal status, it has to be approved as an official policy document by relevant authorities in the TEI, as well as the ministry or relevant divisions within the ministry, depending on the structures and the practices of that specific country. This is an important step as it gives the policy legitimacy. Once it is approved, a policy also serves as an advocacy instrument, as well as a document that could be used to raise funds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Policy implementation ===
Implementation refers to the actual practical activities that need to be carried out to realize the policy goals and objectives. A number of critical decisions are made at this stage: decisions about regulations, structures, budget and partnerships, all of which are necessary to implement the policy. Policy implementation requires a commitment. As observed from experience, many countries and organizations have very good policy instruments, but most of the time they remain on paper. After going through the process of policy development, which is very resource intensive, its implementation requires serious consideration. The first inquiry should determine the changes needed to implement the policy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Policy evaluation ===
Evaluation is monitoring and assessing the process and impact of policy implementation. Policy research and analysis are used as strategies to evaluate whether the policy goals were reached, and if there were any unanticipated positive or negative outcomes. The evaluation process also attempts to see the various types of impacts: direct versus indirect, and short term versus long term. The information gathered from the evaluation will be used as inputs in the next policy cycle or process. Policy monitoring and evaluation is usually a challenging step as it requires consistent follow up, information collection, and efforts to compare policy goals with the outcome of activities carried out to implement the policy. The policy goals serve as a framework for any instrument that is designed to collect and compile information for the evaluation. The instruments that are designed should ensure that gender is included as a category of analysis and that issues concerning both men and women are included in the questions. Specific women's issues, as identified in the policy problem, should be covered, and during the data collection process both men and women should be included as sources of data. In the context of TEIs the data to be gathered on enrolment, performance and achievement, in-service training, promotion, leadership and administration are to be disaggregated by sex.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Berlin_Universitaet_um_1850.jpg|thumb|The current Humboldt University of Berlin in 1850]]

'''Humboldt's ideal of education''' refers to the holistic education of the arts in conjunction with the respective study direction. This ideal goes back to [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], who in the time of the [[Prussian reforms]] relied on a growing educated middle-class and thereby promoted the claim on general education. Today, the term often refers to the central idea of the unity of research and teaching at universities and various other institutes of higher education (in contrast to pure teaching professorships without research obligation).

== Term Reference ==
Humboldt, as head of the ''ministry of culture and public education'' in the ''Prussian Interior Ministry'', incorporated this ideal into educational reforms. In the actual policy it did not extend to the Prussian elementary schools, which also came under the section next to the universities. Occasionally it is therefore alternatively referred to as ''Humboldt's university ideal''.

== Historic Overview ==
''Humboldt's educational ideal'' developed around two central concepts of public education: The concept of the autonomous individual and the concept of [[Cosmopolitanism|world citizenship]]. The university should be a place where autonomous individuals and [[World_citizen#World_citizen|World Citizen]] are produced at or more specifically, produce themselves.

* An autonomous individual is to be an individual who attains self-determination and responsibility through his use of reason.
* "The ''[[Cosmopolitanism|Weltbürgertum]]'' is the collective bond, which connects autonomous individuals, irrespective of their social and cultural socialization: Humboldt says: 'To transform the world as much as possible into one's own person is, in the higher sense of the word, living'. The endeavor shall aim at working through the world comprehensively, and thereby unfold as a subject. To become a [[Cosmopolitanism|citizen of the world]] means, to deal with the big questions of humanity: to seek peace, justice, and care about the exchange of cultures, other gender relationships or another relationship to nature."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humboldtgesellschaft.de/inhalt.php?name=humboldt Jürgen Hofmann: Welche Bedeutung hat das Humboldt'sche Erbe für unsere Zeit?]&lt;/ref&gt; University education should not be job-focused, but educational training that is independent of economic interests.

[[Academic freedom]] describes independence of the university from outside governmental and economic constraints. The university is to evade government influence. Humboldt demands that the scientific institution of higher education should loose itself "from all forms within the state". Therefore, his concept of university planned, for example, that the University of Berlin should have its own goods in order to finance itself and thereby secure its economic independence. [[Academic freedom]] also demands, next to independence of the university from outside governmental and economic constraints, the independence from within; i.e. free choice of study and free organization of studies. The University should therefore be a place of permanent public exchange between all involved in the scientific process. The integration of their knowledge shall be pursued with the help of philosophy. Philosophy is supposed to represent a kind of basic science, which allows members of different scientific disciplines to bring an exchange of their discovery and to link them together. ''Humboldt's educational ideal'' formed German University History decisively for a long period, albeit it was never realized practically in its entirety or cannot be realized. Great intellectual achievements of German science is linked to it.

[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Theodor W. Adorno]] and [[Albert Einstein]] confessed themselves to it.

== Current Situation and Development ==

While during Humboldt's time universities mainly conducted state-organized academic research, there are now in Germany's [[tertiary education]] new forms of higher education, which now all have a scientific mission to research.&lt;ref&gt;vgl. Hochschulgesetze der Länder&lt;/ref&gt; The demands of Humboldt's ideal of education can therefore be applied on all German universities.

Critics see in many current reforms, such as the [[Bologna process]], a departure from Humboldt's ideal towards greater occupational studies with economic interests. Furthermore, it is criticized that the [[Academic_freedom|freedom of teaching]] is restricted by the [[Bologna process]].

'''Instructional Materials''' are any collection of materials including [[animate]] and inanimate objects and human and non-human resources that a teacher may use in teaching and learning situations to help achieve desired learning objectives.  Instructional materials may aid a student in concretizing a learning experience so as to make learning more exciting, interesting and interactive.
They are tools used in instructional activities, which include active learning and assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.igi-global.com/dictionary/relevance-of-the-use-of-instructional-materials-in-teaching-and-pedagogical-delivery/48956|work=global dictionary|accessdate=4 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term encompasses all the materials and physical means an instructor might use to implement instruction and facilitate students achievement of instructional objectives.

The value of instructional materials as a pedagogical aid can be seen in [[Vachel Lindsay]]'s poem "Euclid":
{{Quote
|text=&lt;poem&gt;Old [[Euclid]] drew a circle
On a sand-beach, long ago.
He bounded and enclosed it
With angles thus and so.

His set of solemn greybeards
Nodded and argued much
Of [[Arc (geometry)|arc]] and of circumference
Diameter and such.

A silent child stood by them
From morning until noon,
Because they drew such charming
Round pictures of the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Poetry: A Magazine of Verse |volume=II |date=April–September 1913 |editor1-last=Monroe |editor1-first=Harriet |last=Lindsay |first=Vachel |chapter=Euclid |page=123 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4IcVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

==Types of Instructional Materials==

==Evaluation of Instructional Materials==
===Peer-Reviewed Instructional Materials Online (PRIMO) Committee===
The Peer-Reviewed Instructional Materials Online (PRIMO) Committee "'promotes and shares peer-reviewed instructional materials created by librarians to teach people about discovering, accessing and evaluating information in networked environments.' In doing so, it reviews librarian-created online tutorials dealing with information literacy and critical thinking skills, and highlights the highest-caliber projects through its “Site of the Month” posts on the ACRL Instruction Section blog (http://acrl.ala.org/IS/category/committees/primo)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kaspar |first1=Wendy |last2=Borgerding |first2=Jodie |date=2017 |title=PRIMO: Peer-Reviewed Instructional Materials Online |url=https://crl.acrl.org/index.php/crl/article/view/16563/18009 |journal=College and Research Libraries (Online) |volume=78 |pages=2–7 |doi=10.5860/crl.78.1.2 |access-date=July 1, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  PRIMO's goal is to provide librarians quality tutorials for instructional use on a variety of topics in order to save time, effort and cost.  PRIMO accepts non-promotional online instructional material intended for undergraduate or graduate-level audiences emphasizing quality over comprehensiveness.

'''International education''' refers to a dynamic concept that involves a journey or movement of people, minds, or ideas across political and cultural frontiers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moran Hansen|first=Holly|date=2002|title=Defining international education|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/he.41|journal=New Directions for Higher Education|language=en|volume=2002|issue=117|pages=5–12|doi=10.1002/he.41|issn=0271-0560}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is facilitated by the [[globalization]] phenomenon, which increasingly erases the constraints of geography on economic, social and cultural arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook on Globalization and Higher Education|last=King|first=Roger|last2=Marginson|first2=Simon|last3=Naidoo|first3=Rajani|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781848445857|location=Cheltenham, UK|pages=324}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept involves a broad range of learning, covering, for instance, [[Formal learning|formal education]] and [[informal learning]] (e.g. training, [[Student exchange program|exchange programs]], [[cross-cultural communication]]).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Annual Review of Comparative and International Education 2017|last=Wiseman|first=Alexander|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|year=2018|isbn=9781787437661|location=Bingley, WA|pages=211-212}}&lt;/ref&gt; It could also involve a reorientation of academic outlook such as the pursuit of “worldmindedness” as a goal so that a school or its academic focus is considered [[International school|international]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, the [[Association of Public and Land-grant Universities|National Association of State Universities]] prescribes the adoption of "proper education" that reflects the full range of international, social, political, cultural, and economic dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Engineering Technology, Engineering Education and Engineering Management: Proceedings of the 2014 International Conference on Engineering Technology, Engineering Education and Engineering Management (ETEEEM 2014), Hong Kong, 15-16 November 201|last=Tan|first=Deyao|publisher=CRC Press|year=2015|isbn=9781138027800|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The emergence of international education as a discipline may be attributed to the international and intercontinental initiatives of the past, which aimed to achieve education, learning, and intellectual exchange. This is demonstrated in the formalized academic relations between countries in the form of bilateral and scientific agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Routledge Handbook of International Education and Development|last=McGrath|first=Simon|last2=Gu|first2=Qing|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9780415747547|location=Oxon|pages=333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, international education is considered a mechanism of international cooperation and, in some cases, it stems from the recognition that different cultures offer different outlooks and styles of learning and teaching in addition to the transfer of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Enhancing Asia-Europe Co-operation Through Educational Exchange|last=Wessala|first=Georg|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=9780415481946|location=Oxon|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

There are scholars who associate the development of international education with [[comparative education]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Comparative Education: The Dialectic of the Global and the Local|last=Arnove|first=Robert|last2=Torres|first2=Carlos Alberto|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year=2007|isbn=0742559858|location=Lanham, MD|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is concerned with the evaluation and scrutiny of different educational systems in various countries for the purpose of developing an education and educational structures that are global in scope and application. This concept is considered ancient, having been used in [[classical Greece]], while the actual term was first used by [[William Russell (educator)|William Russell]] in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Handbook of Comparative Education|last=Cowen|first=Robert|last2=Kazamias|first2=Andreas|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=9781402064029|location=Dordrecht|pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; International education diverged from it as it assumed the form of more organized programs that bring together learners and teachers from different countries to learn from each other.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

International education can be seen as developing ‘international-mindedness,’ or enhancing international attitude and awareness &lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cambridge *|first=James|last2=Thompson|first2=Jeff|date=2004|title=Internationalism and globalization as contexts for international education|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/0305792042000213994|journal=Compare: A Journal of Comparative and International Education|language=en|volume=34|issue=2|pages=161–175|doi=10.1080/0305792042000213994|issn=0305-7925|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;. From an ideological perspective, international education has a focus on moral development, by influencing the creation of “positive attitudes towards peace, international understanding and responsible world citizenship”&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;.

From a pragmatic approach, international education can relate to economic and cultural globalization&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;. For instance, there are increasing demands for education qualifications to be transferable between schools and education systems&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;. Furthermore, there is a “spread of global quality standards through quality assurances procedures such as accreditation”&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;.

Overall, international education can be viewed as the following:  

* Promoting international understanding/international-mindedness and/or global awareness/understanding&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

* Being active in global engagement/global or world citizenship&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tate|first=Nicholas|date=2013|title=International education in a post-Enlightenment world|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00131911.2013.785938|journal=Educational Review|language=en|volume=65|issue=3|pages=253–266|doi=10.1080/00131911.2013.785938|issn=0013-1911|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Increasing intercultural understanding and respect for difference&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

* Encouraging tolerance and commitment to peace &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Direct examples of international education include facilitating students’ entry into universities outside of their home countries&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayden|first=Mary|last2=McIntosh|first2=Shona|date=2018-02-06|title=International education: the transformative potential of experiential learning|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/03054985.2017.1402757|journal=Oxford Review of Education|language=en|volume=44|issue=4|pages=403–413|doi=10.1080/03054985.2017.1402757|issn=0305-4985|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Also, temporarily studying abroad is another illustration of international education&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

The International Baccalaureate (IB) Program is seen as an influence in the development of international education&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;. The IB Diploma Program encourages students to learn and understand different cultures, languages, and points of view&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. This idea is incorporated into elements of the program e.g. Creativity, Activity, Service (CAS) &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. CAS requires students to participate in activities promoting each of these three components. Through such activities, the intention is that global issues will affect students’ understanding of the world in a meaningful way&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. Specifically, these non-formal, non-academic experiences should enhance students’ comprehension of world issues in a manner that, for instance, reading books or participating in lessons may not &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

Based on student engagement and involvement, two general meanings emerge. The first refers to education that transcends national borders through the exchange of people. A good example would be students traveling to study at an [[international branch campus]], as part of a [[study abroad]] program or as part of a [[student exchange program]].{{According to whom|date=June 2018}} The second is a comprehensive approach to education that intentionally prepares students to be active and engaged participants in an interconnected world.{{According to whom|date=June 2018}}

The [[International Baccalaureate]] however, defines the term according to a certain criteria. This criteria include the development of citizens of the world in accordance with culture, language, and social cohesion, building a sense of identity and cultural awareness, encrypting recognition and development of universal human values, encouraging discovery and enjoyment of learning, equipping students with collectivist or individualistic skills and knowledge that can be applied broadly, fostering global thinking when responding to local situations, encourage diversity and flexibility in teaching pedagogic methodologies, and supply appropriate forms of assessment and international benchmarking.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

While definitions vary, '''international education''' is generally taken{{By whom|date=June 2018}} to include:
* Knowledge of other world regions &amp; cultures;
* Familiarity with international and [[global studies|global issues]];
* Skills in working effectively within global or cross-cultural environments, and using information from different sources around the world;
* Ability to communicate in multiple languages; and
* Dispositions towards respect and concern for other cultures and peoples.

==Millennium Development Goals==
One of the eight [[Millennium Development Goals|millennium development goals]] ratified in the [[United Nations]] in the year 2000, focuses on achieving universal primary education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wysokińska|first=Zofia|date=March 2017|title=Millennium Development Goals/UN and Sustainable Development Goals/UN as Instruments for Realizing Sustainable Development Concept in the Global Economy|url=https://libproxy.berkeley.edu/login?qurl=http%3a%2f%2fsearch.ebscohost.com%2flogin.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26db%3dbth%26AN%3d121741476%26site%3deds-live|journal=Comparative Economic Research|volume=20|pages=101-118|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;. {{non sequitur|date=June 2018}}

== Sustainable Development Goals ==
At the end of 2015, the United Nations led another initiative to continue on the work of development goals. [[Sustainable Development Goals|The Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) contains 17 global goals, which are more extensive than the [[Millennium Development Goals|Millenium Development Goals]] (MDGs). Compared to the 2015 MDGs, the SDGs tries to ensure that no one is left behind. In this regard, not only state actors, but also major private “non-state” actors and multinational companies are involved and active in global education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ei-ie.org/en/detail_page/4918/sustainable-development-goals|title=Sustainable Development Goals : Education International|last=International|first=Education|work=Education International|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education is stated under Goal 4 of the SDGs: “Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg4|title=Goal 4 .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, SDGs promote international education through some of the following targets:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg4|title=Goal 4 .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* “By 2030, ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including, among others, through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture and non-violence, global citizenship and appreciation of cultural diversity, and of culture’s contribution to sustainable development” (Target 4.7)

* “By 2020, substantially expand globally the number of scholarships available to developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing States and African countries, for enrollment in higher education, including vocational training and information and communications technology, technical, engineering, and scientific programs, in developed countries and other developing countries” (Target 4.B)

* “Volume of official development assistance flows for scholarships by sector and type of study” (Indicator 4.B.1)

* “By 2030, substantially increase the supply of qualified teachers, including through international cooperation for teacher training in developing countries, especially least developed countries and small island developing States” (Target 4.C)

* “Proportion of teachers in: (a) pre-primary; (b) primary; (c) lower secondary; and (d) upper secondary education who have received at least the minimum organized teacher training (e.g. pedagogical training) pre-service or in-service required for teaching at the relevant level in a given country” (Indicator 4.C.1)

According to a report from the U.N. Secretary-General on “Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals” in 2018, [[official development assistance]] (ODA) for scholarships amounted to $1.2 billion in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Progress Towards the Sustainable Development Goals (English)|first=United Nations|publisher=United Nations Economic and Social Council|year=2018|isbn=|location=New York|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest contributors were Australia, France, the United Kingdom of Great Britain, Northern Ireland, and European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bank|first=The World|date=2015-12-01|title=Incheon declaration : education 2030 - towards inclusive and equitable quality education and lifelong learning for all|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/167341467987876458/Incheon-declaration-education-2030-towards-inclusive-and-equitable-quality-education-and-lifelong-learning-for-all|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Education is a core aspect of the SDGs, and considered essential to their success.

There are different lenses international education can be viewed as. For example, thinking of international education in terms of a study abroad program that can help prepare students when looking for international occupations. Another example can be that international development is a focal point that is taught in colleges and universities under the umbrella of international education.

== Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) ==
Although very successful programs such as [[Engineers Without Borders]]{{Example needed |s|date=June 2018}} enable students in one country to obtain an international education while working on [[open source appropriate technology]] projects abroad, the cost of this approach can be prohibitive for large scale replication. Recent, work has shown that using a virtual educational exchange, can have many of the positive benefits associated with international education and cross cultural experiences, without the prohibitive costs of overseas programs.&lt;ref&gt;Augusta Abrahamse, Mathew Johnson, Nanette Levinson, Larry Medsker, Joshua M.

==International Education Week==
International Education Week is held in the United States by the U.S. Department of State and U.S. Department of Education.  The choice of week for celebration is determined at each institution, but is generally the week before the week that includes [[Thanksgiving (United States)|U.S. Thanksgiving]]: {{Weekday after date|{{LASTYEAR}}|November|11|Monday|F j}}–{{Weekday after date|{{LASTYEAR}}|November|15|Friday|j, Y}}; {{Weekday after date|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|November|11|Monday|F j}}–{{Weekday after date|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|November|15|Friday|j, Y}}; {{Weekday after date|{{NEXTYEAR}}|November|11|Monday|F j}}–{{Weekday after date|{{NEXTYEAR}}|November|15|Friday|j, Y}}; {{Weekday after date|{{#expr:{{NEXTYEAR}}+1}}|November|11|Monday|F j}}–{{Weekday after date|{{#expr:{{NEXTYEAR}}+1}}|November|15|Friday|j, Y}}.&lt;ref name="DOS-week"&gt;[http://eca.state.gov/programs-initiatives/international-education-week United States Department of State: International Education Week]&lt;/ref&gt;  The aims of this event are to provide an opportunity to celebrate the benefits of international education and global exchange.This joint initiative promotes programs that prepare Americans for a global milieu and attract future leaders from abroad to study, learn and exchange experiences in the U.S. This shows how International education is not just about physically crossing borders, but is also about thinking globally in local situations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iew.state.gov International Education Week 2010].

==Challenges Facing International education==
{{globalize|section|USA|date=December 2017}}
International education has a somewhat unusual position in higher education.{{According to whom|date=June 2018}} While recognized as an important sphere of activity, it tends to be handled by administrative offices at the top of departments of languages and literature and international affairs. The scholars involved in international education usually have their primary involvement in other teaching and research.{{According to whom|date=June 2018}} This leads to four distinctive characteristics particular to the field of international education:&lt;ref&gt;Cummings, William.ERIC Clearinghouse on Higher Education Washington DC. Current Challenges of International Education. ERIC Digest.Publication Date: 2001-12-00&lt;/ref&gt;

# There is little consensus concerning the guiding theme of the field as well as its scope. Should the field stress internationalization, trans nationalization, or globalization?&lt;ref&gt;(Barrows, 2000; Committee for Transnational Competence, 2000; Hilary, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;
# International education is not a prominent feature of the contemporary higher education experience. Using enrollment in foreign languages as an indicator, 16 percent of all U.S. college students were enrolled in foreign languages in the peak period of the 1960s; the proportion is currently down to 8 percent (Hayward, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;6).
# There is imbalance in regional coverage. The regions and languages covered at a particular institution are a function of idiosyncratic patterns of faculty recruitment. Nationally, there is reasonable coverage of Western Europe and Latin America and most European languages compared to limited coverage of Africa and the Middle East. For students enrolled in foreign languages, Spanish is the most popular followed by the other major languages of Western Europe; 6 percent enroll in Asian languages. Languages of the Middle East make up only 2 percent (1.3 being Hebrew and .5 percent Arabic). The languages of Africa constitute only 0.15 percent of enrollments.
# Because international education is not a primary concern of most scholars in the field, research is somewhat sporadic, non-cumulative, and tends to be carried out by national organizations as part of advocacy projects (e.g. Lambert, 1989; Brecht and Rivers, 2000). The most recent example is the American Council of Education's (ACE's) Internationalization of Higher Education: A Status Report. (Hayward, 2000). However, programs through various institutions, such as the [[Fulbright Program]] offer research opportunities for those wishing to study abroad.

Additionally, one of the challenges of international students is that increasingly higher education institutions are treating them as cash cows {{buzzword inline|date=June 2018}} for meeting their budget challenges. Institutions must do more to support international students in their academic and career success by providing advising, training and coaching that is culturally attuned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://resources.interedge.org/2016/03/05/higher-education-must-go-beyond-recruitment-and-immigration-compliance-of-international-students/|title=International Students are Paying More for Education; are Universities Doing Enough?|last=Hu|first=Di|date=2016-03-05|website=interEDGE.org}}&lt;/back&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12332">'''''Last in First Out''''' (LIFO) (or otherwise known as "Last One Hired is the First One Fired" is a policy often used by school districts and other employers to prioritize [[layoff]]s by [[seniority]].  Under LIFO layoff rules, junior teachers and other employees lose their jobs before senior ones.  Laying off junior employees first is not exclusive to the education sector or to the United States, but is perhaps most controversial there.  LIFO's proponents claim that it protects teachers with [[tenure]] and gives them job stability, and that it is an easily administered way of accomplishing layoffs following a budget cut.  LIFO's critics respond that it is bad for students. They prefer that the best teachers remain regardless of how long they have been teaching.

LIFO and tenure were originally intended to provide college [[professor|professors]] with [[academic freedom]] and ensure that they could research topics of their own choosing. In the K-12 sector, tenure was introduced to lower high teacher turnover rates. In 1932, over 20% of teachers were dismissed due to personal disagreements and difference of opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Butsch, R. (1937). Tenure of teachers. Teacher Personnel, 7(3), 292-295.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2010, LIFO was criticized on grounds that "seniority based layoffs result in promising, inexperienced teachers losing their positions, while their less effective, but more senior, peers continue to teach."&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, D. J., Lankford, H., Loeb, S., &amp; Wyckoff, J. H. (2010). Teacher layoffs: An empirical illustration of seniority vs. measures of effectiveness. brief 12.National Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/864940729&lt;/ref&gt; As of early 2014, 2 states provided that seniority could not be considered when deciding which teachers to layoff, 18 states and the District of Columbia left the layoff criteria to school district discretion, 20 states provided that seniority could be considered among other factors, and 10 states provided that seniority was the sole factor, or one that had to be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara v.

== Effects of seniority-prioritized layoffs ==

LIFO has a more severe impact in poor or high minority schools, since those schools tend to have newer and less experienced teachers. In schools where 34% or less of the students receive [[Reduced price meal|Free and Reduced meals]], more than 82% of teachers have 4 or more years of experience. However, in schools where more than 75% of the student body receives Free and Reduced meals,  only 77% of the teachers have more than 4 years of experience.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Schools and Staffing Survey, "Public School Teacher, BIE School Teacher, and Private School Teacher Data Files," 2007-2008&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in California, it was seen that in schools in the lowest quartile of minority students, only 8 of every 100 teachers had two or less years of teaching whereas in schools with the highest [[quartile]] of minority students, 13 of every 100 teachers had two or less years of teaching, meaning that under LIFO-based layoffs, schools with larger minority populations would lose 60% more teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Sepe, Cristina, and Marguerite Roza. The Disproportionate Impact of Seniority Based Layoffs on Poor, Minority Students. Rep. Seattle: Center on Reinventing Public Education, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, teachers in high need areas, such as secondary math and special education, are often less experienced due to the difficulty of recruiting these positions, and districts who adhere strictly to seniority based systems for layoffs face the added burden of recruiting teachers in these areas.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhaber, Dan and Theobold, Roddy (2010). "Assessing the Determinants and Implications of Teacher Layoffs." Center for Education Data &amp; Research, University of Washington-Bothell.&lt;/ref&gt; In Los Angeles, it was noted that of the hundreds of promising new teachers cut in from the district in 2010 due to LIFO, 190 were in the top fifth overall of teachers in raising math and reading scores.&lt;ref&gt;Felch, Jason; Song, Jason; and Smith, Doug (2010). "When layoffs come to L.A. schools, performance doesn't count." Los Angeles Times, December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research indicates that the effectiveness of teachers does not change after the first few years in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hanushek]] and Steven G. Rivkin, "The Distribution of Teacher Quality and Implications for Policy." Annual Review of Economics 4 (2012): 7.1-7.27.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the implications of using LIFO rules for layoffs instead of basing layoffs on classroom effectiveness appear huge.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhaber, Dan and Theobold, Roddy (2010). "Assessing the Determinants and Implications of Teacher Layoffs." Center for Education Data &amp; Research, University of Washington-Bothell; Steven Glazerman, Susanna Loeb, Dan Goldhaber, Douglas Staiger, Stephen Raudenbush, and Grover Whitehurst, ''Evaluating Teachers: The Important Role of Value-Added'' (Washington, DC: Brookings Institution, 2010); Donald Boyd, Hamilton Lankford, Susanna Loeb, and James Wyckoff, "Teacher Layoffs: An Empirical Illustration of Seniority versus Measures of Effectiveness." ''Education Finance and Policy'' 6, no. 3 (Summer 2011): 439-454.&lt;/ref&gt;{{elucidate|date=November 2015}}  With LIFO, more teachers must be dismissed to meet budgetary targets than with effectiveness-based layoffs because the youngest teachers are the least paid, but the teachers dismissed under the LIFO policy are only slightly below average in effectiveness.  An effectiveness-based policy on the other hand leads to dramatic improvements in average teacher quality, and these improvements have lasting effects on students throughout their lives.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hanushek]], "Valuing teachers: How much is a good teacher worth?" ''Education Next'' 11, no. 3 (Summer 2011); Raj Chetty, John N. Friedman, and Jonah E. Rockoff, "The Long-Term Impacts of Teachers: Teacher Value-Added and Student Outcomes in Adulthood," WP17699 (Cambridge, MA: National Bureau of Economic Research, December 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==LIFO and value-added economic modeling==
{{POV-section|date=July 2017}}
In many states, tenure is given to teachers after 3 years, without much indication of job performance. A [[Value-added modeling|value added model]] (VAM) could be used in tenure decisions for teachers in order to estimate teacher quality. A VAM would predict how well a teacher would do based on his or her previous experience teaching. Data shows that the VAM based on standardized test scores, is a better indicator of teacher performance than any observable attributes.

The American Economic Review, 100(2), 250-250-255. {{doi|10.1257/aer.100.2.250}}&lt;/ref&gt; In using a VAM to evaluate teachers for a tenure decision, school districts can ensure that the teachers they retain (and the teachers who in turn become the most senior) are effective educators, thereby eliminating some of the discrepancy between LIFO and performance-based layoffs.&lt;ref&gt;McCaffrey, D.

== Controversy and the overhaul of LIFO ==

Since less experienced teachers typically have lower salaries, it is estimated that if districts in the [[United States]] cut 5% of their budget through seniority based layoffs, approximately 79,000 more teachers would lose their jobs versus seniority neutral layoffs.&lt;ref&gt;The Case Against Quality Blind Teacher Layoffs.

In a survey of New York State parents regarding teacher quality versus seniority,  voters said they did not care how long a teacher had taught so long as the teacher was effective and produced good results.&lt;ref&gt;New York voters oppose "last-in, first-out" for teacher layoffs - NYPOST.com.

Starting with Arizona in 2009, certain states and districts have been passing laws which prohibit seniority from being the deciding factor in layoff decisions. Maine, Louisiana, and District of Columbia use multiple criteria in determining layoffs, and numerous other states are trending towards performance based over seniority based layoffs.&lt;ref&gt;Teacher Layoffs: Rethinking "Last-Hired, First Fired" Policies.

[[Michelle Rhee]], the former Chancellor of Washington, D.C. public schools, opposes the Last in First Out policy, instead suggesting performance based evaluation to determine layoffs.&lt;ref&gt;End "last in, first out" teacher layoffs - CNN.com.

Web. 10 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.studentsfirst.org/lifo&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014 court case of ''[[Vergara v. California]]'' struck down California's LIFO layoff rules as having a disproportionately negative impact on poor and minority public school students, thus violating the California Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara v.

In this situation, "[n]o matter how gifted the junior teacher, and no matter how grossly ineffective the senior teacher, the junior gifted one . . . is separated from [the students] and a senior grossly ineffective one . . . is left in place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2014) - Judgment |pinpoint = page 13, lines 19-23 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge concluded that "[t]he logic of [this scheme] is unfathomable and therefore constitutionally unsupportable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2014) - Judgment |pinpoint = page 14, lines 4-5 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2213">'''Maimonides' rule''' is named after the 12th-century rabbinic scholar [[Maimonides]], who identified a correlation between class size and students' achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1162/003355399556061| title = Using Maimonides' Rule to Estimate the Effect of Class Size on Scholastic Achievement| journal = [[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]| volume = 114| issue = 2| pages = 533–575| year = 1999| last1 = Angrist | first1 = J. D.| last2 = Lavy | first2 = V.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today this rule is widely used in educational research to evaluate the effect of class size on students' test scores. Maimonides' rule states that a class size may rise to an upper limit of 40 students. Once this quota is reached the class is cut in half, so instead of one class with forty-one students there are now two classes: one with twenty students and one with twenty-one students.

[[Joshua Angrist]] and Victor Lavy (1999) have used "the nonlinear relationship between the local number of students and the class size predicted by Maimonides' rule to estimate the impact of class size on student performance, and evaluate the effect of being just below the number of students for whom an additional teacher would be brought up, and of being just above this number."&lt;ref name=case&gt;{{cite web|last=Case|first=Anne|title=The Primacy of Education|url=http://www.princeton.edu/rpds/papers/WP_203.pdf|work=Working Papers|publisher=Research Program in Development Studies|accessdate=5 March 2013|format=PDF|date=July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their results have shown highly irregular patterns in class size that are precisely mirrored in student achievement. They have found that a reduction in predicted class size of ten students is associated with a 0.25 [[standard deviation]] increase in fifth-graders' test scores.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qVNLt3Cei1EC&amp;pg=PA278&amp;lpg=PA278&amp;dq=%22Maimonides%27+Rule%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tECKvNEKPg&amp;sig=OtoecnOlFOPvo6mEXG3OA8MEKsY&amp;hl=iw&amp;ei=PRC6SqOlEpfbjQfFjJ3_BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Maimonides%27%20Rule%22&amp;f=false Understanding poverty p.278]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MOOC poster mathplourde.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Poster, entitled "MOOC, every letter is negotiable", exploring the meaning of the words "Massive Open Online Course"]]
A '''massive open online course''' ('''MOOC''' {{IPAc-en|m|uː|k}}) is an [[online course]] aimed at unlimited participation and open access via the [[World Wide Web|web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kaplan |first1=Andreas M. |last2=Haenlein |first2=Michael |year=2016 |title=Higher education and the digital revolution: About MOOCs, SPOCs, social media, and the Cookie Monster |journal=Business Horizons |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=441–50 |doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2016.03.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to traditional course materials such as filmed lectures, readings, and [[problem set]]s, many MOOCs provide [[interactive course]]s with user forums to support community interactions among students, professors, and [[teaching assistant]]s (TAs) as well as immediate feedback to quick quizzes and assignments. MOOCs are a recent and widely researched development in [[distance education]] which were first introduced in 2006 and emerged as a popular mode of learning in 2012.&lt;ref name=pappano/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes030613&gt;{{cite news|last=Lewin|first=Tamar|title=Universities Abroad Join Partnerships on the Web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/21/education/universities-abroad-join-mooc-course-projects.html|accessdate=6 March 2013|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early MOOCs often emphasized open-access features, such as [[Open content|open licensing]] of content, structure and learning goals, to promote the reuse and remixing of resources.  Some later MOOCs use closed licenses for their course materials while maintaining free access for students.&lt;ref name="MOOC Misnomer"&gt;Wiley, David.

== History ==
[[File:What is a MOOC.ogv|thumb|What is a MOOC?, December 2010]]

=== Precursors ===
{{main|Distance learning}}

Before the [[Digital Age]], [[distance learning]] appeared in the form of [[correspondence courses]] in the 1890s–1920s and later radio and television broadcast of courses and early forms of [[e-learning]]. Typically fewer than five percent of the students would complete a course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saettler|first=L. Paul |year=1968 |title=A History of Instructional Technology |location=New York |publisher=McGraw Hill |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=AN47AAAAIAAJ}}|isbn=0070544107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2000s saw changes in [[E-learning|online, or e-learning]] and distance education, with increasing online presence, open learning opportunities, and the development of MOOCs.&lt;ref name="blogs.cetis.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cetis.org.uk/cetisli/2015/05/11/moocs-and-open-education-timeline-updated/|title=MOOCs and Open Education Timeline (updated 2015)}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010 audiences for the most popular college courses such as "Justice" with [[Michael J. Sandel]] and "Human Anatomy" with [[Marian Diamond]] were reaching millions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/education/edlife/18opentop10-t.html"What They're Watching"],"The New York Times",03/07/2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The first MOOCs emerged from the [[open educational resources]] (OER) movement, and from work by researchers who pointed out that class size and learning outcomes had no established connection.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2007/12/06/does-class-size-matter&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''MOOC'' was coined in 2008 by Dave Cormier of the [[University of Prince Edward Island]] in response to a course called ''Connectivism and Connective Knowledge'' (also known as ''CCK08''). CCK08, which was led by [[George Siemens]] of [[Athabasca University]] and [[Stephen Downes]] of the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]], consisted of 25 tuition-paying students in [[continuing education|Extended Education]] at the [[University of Manitoba]], as well as over 2200 online students from the general public who paid nothing.&lt;ref name="THE"&gt;{{cite news|last=Parr|first=Chris|title=Mooc creators criticise courses’ lack of creativity|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/mooc-creators-criticise-courses-lack-of-creativity/2008180.article|accessdate=1 June 2015|newspaper=Times Higher Education|date=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All course content was available through [[RSS]] feeds, and online students could participate through collaborative tools, including blog posts, threaded discussions in [[Moodle]], and [[Second Life]] meetings.&lt;ref name="downes"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://sites.google.com/site/themoocguide/3-cck08---the-distributed-course | title=CCK08 - The Distributed Course | work=The MOOC Guide | year=2008 | accessdate=11 September 2013 | author=Downes, Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite AV media | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAVwQ7RJWqg | title=Attention les MOOC!?!

Other cMOOCs were then developed; for example, Jim Groom from The [[University of Mary Washington]] and Michael Branson Smith of [[York College, City University of New York]] hosted MOOCs through several universities starting with 2011's 'Digital Storytelling' (ds106) MOOC.&lt;ref name="GROOM"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/04/24/open-course-digital-storytelling-enjoys-modest-success | title=Proto-MOOC Stays the Course | publisher=Inside Higher Ed | date=24 April 2012 | accessdate=29 April 2015 | author=Kolowich, Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt; MOOCs from private, non-profit institutions&lt;!-- public schools and for-profits did not? --&gt; emphasized prominent faculty members and expanded existing distance learning offerings (e.g., podcasts) into free and open online courses.&lt;ref&gt;The College of St. Scholastica, "[http://go.css.edu/learn Massive Open Online Courses]", (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside the development of these open courses, other E-learning platforms emerged — such as [[Khan Academy]], [[Peer-to-Peer University]] (P2PU), [[Udemy]], and [[ALISON (company)|ALISON]] — which are viewed as similar to MOOCs and work outside the university system or emphasize individual self-paced lessons.&lt;ref name="CETIS78"&gt;Yuan, Li, and Stephen Powell.

=== cMOOCs and xMOOCs ===

[[File:Timeline of MOOC and open education development with organisational efforts in the areas.png|thumb|left || upright=1.6|MOOCs and Open Education Timeline (updated 2015 version)&lt;ref name="blogs.cetis.org.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openeducationeuropa.eu/en/article/Innovation-entrepreneurship-and-education-In-Depth-41-3?paper=169497|title=Partnership Model for Entrepreneurial Innovation in Open Online Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

As MOOCs developed with time, multiple conceptions of the platform seem to have emerged. Mostly two different types can be differentiated: those that emphasize a connectivist philosophy, and those that resemble more traditional courses. To distinguish the two, several early adopters of the platform proposed the terms "cMOOC" and "xMOOC".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Siemens|first=George |url=http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2012/07/25/moocs-are-really-a-platform/ |title=MOOCs are really a platform |publisher=Elearnspace |accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prpić|first1=John|last2=Melton|first2=James|last3=Taeihagh|first3=Araz|last4=Anderson|first4=Terry|title=MOOCs and crowdsourcing: Massive courses and massive resources|journal=First Monday|date=16 December 2015|volume=20|issue=12|doi=10.5210/fm.v20i12.6143|arxiv=1702.05002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

cMOOCs are based on principles from [[Connectivism|connectivist pedagogy]] indicating that material should be ''aggregated'' (rather than pre-selected), ''[[Remix#Broader context|remixable]]'', ''re-purposable'', and ''feeding forward'' (i.e. evolving materials should be targeted at future learning).&lt;ref&gt;Downes, Stephen [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephen-downes/connectivism-and-connecti_b_804653.html "'Connectivism' and Connective Knowledge"], Huffpost Education, 5 January 2011, accessed 27 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kop, Rita [http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/882 "The challenges to connectivist learning on open online networks: Learning experiences during a massive open online course"], International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning, Volume 12, Number 3, 2011, accessed 22 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Frances [http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/902/1664 "Connectivism: Its Place in Theory-Informed Research and Innovation in Technology-Enabled Learning"], International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning, Volume 12, Number 3, 2011, accessed 31 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Downes, Stephen. [http://it.coe.uga.edu/itforum/paper92/paper92.html "Learning networks and connective knowledge"], Instructional Technology Forum, 2006, accessed 31 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  cMOOC instructional design approaches attempt to connect learners to each other to answer questions or collaborate on joint projects. This may include emphasizing collaborative development of the MOOC.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|VMfipxhT_Co|title=George Siemens on Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Ravenscroft of the London Metropolitan University claimed that connectivist MOOCs better support collaborative dialogue and knowledge building.&lt;ref name="Ravenscroft"&gt;Dialogue and Connectivism: A New Approach to Understanding and Promoting Dialogue-Rich Networked Learning [http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/934] Andrew Ravenscroft International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning Vol. 12.3 March – 2011, Learning Technology Research Institute (LTRI), London Metropolitan University, UK&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mak Williams Mackness"&gt;S.F.

xMOOCs have a much more traditional course structure. They are characterized by a specified aim of completing the course obtaining certain knowledge certification of the subject matter. They are presented typically with a clearly specified syllabus of recorded lectures and self-test problems. However, some providers require paid subscriptions for acquiring graded materials and certificates. They employ elements of the original MOOC, but are, in some effect, branded IT platforms that offer content distribution partnerships to institutions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;   The instructor is the expert provider of knowledge, and student interactions are usually limited to asking for assistance and advising each other on difficult points.

== Emergence of MOOC providers ==
According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', 2012 became "the year of the MOOC" as several well-financed providers, associated with top universities, emerged, including [[Coursera]], [[Udacity]], and [[edX]].&lt;ref name=pappano&gt;{{cite news|last=Pappano|first=Laura|title=The Year of the MOOC|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/education/edlife/massive-open-online-courses-are-multiplying-at-a-rapid-pace.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|work=The New York Times|accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a presentation at SXSWedu in early 2013, Instructure CEO Josh Coates suggested that MOOCs are in the midst of a hype cycle, with expectations undergoing wild swings.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=zH7gzPU5Moo|title=SXSWedu 2013 - MOOCS: Hype or Hope?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dennis Yang, President of MOOC provider Udemy, later made the point in an article for the ''[[Huffington Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Yang|first = Dennis|title = Are We MOOC'd Out?|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dennis-yang/post_4496_b_2877799.html|work = Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many universities scrambled to join in the "next big thing", as did more established [[online education]] service providers such as [[Blackboard Inc]], in what has been called a "stampede." Dozens of universities in Canada, Mexico, Europe and Asia have announced partnerships with the large American MOOC providers.&lt;ref name=NYT022013/&gt;&lt;ref name="moocyear"&gt;Laura Pappano. [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/education/edlife/massive-open-online-courses-are-multiplying-at-a-rapid-pace.html?pagewanted=1 The Year of the MOOC – The New York Times]. 2 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; By early 2013, questions emerged about whether academia was "MOOC'd out."&lt;ref name="MOOCd out"/&gt;&lt;ref name=FT032013&gt;{{cite news|last=Skapinker|first=Michael|title=Open web courses are massively overhyped|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/84f6cd3e-8a50-11e2-bf79-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2PcHimOzr|accessdate=5 April 2013|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|date=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend was later confirmed in continuing analysis.&lt;ref&gt;See "[http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/the-mooc-fades-in-3-charts/55701 The MOOC Hype Fades] Chronicle of Higher Education. Retrieved March 6, 2015."&lt;/ref&gt;

The industry has an unusual structure, consisting of linked groups including MOOC providers, the larger non-profit sector, universities, related companies and [[venture capitalist]]s. ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' lists the major providers as the non-profits Khan Academy and edX, and the for-profits Udacity and Coursera.&lt;ref name="Major players"&gt;{{cite web|title = Major Players in the MOOC Universe|url = http://chronicle.com/article/The-Major-Players-in-the-MOOC/138817/#id=overview|work = chronicle.com|accessdate = 29 April 2013|date = 29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The larger non-profit organizations include the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], the [[MacArthur Foundation]], the [[National Science Foundation]], and the [[American Council on Education]]. University pioneers include [[Stanford]], [[Harvard]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], the [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], the [[University of Texas at Austin]], the [[University of California at Berkeley]], and [[San Jose State University]].&lt;ref name="Major players"/&gt; Related companies investing in MOOCs include [[Google]] and educational publisher [[Pearson PLC]]. Venture capitalists include [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers]], [[New Enterprise Associates]] and [[Andreessen Horowitz]].&lt;ref name="Major players"/&gt;

In the fall of 2011 Stanford University launched three courses.&lt;ref name="NYT71712"&gt;{{cite news |title = Top universities test the online appeal of free|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/18/education/top-universities-test-the-online-appeal-of-free.html|accessdate = 18 July 2012|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|date = 17 July 2012|author = Richard Pérez-Peña}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of those courses was ''Introduction Into AI'', launched by [[Sebastian Thrun]] and [[Peter Norvig]]. Enrollment quickly reached 160,000 students. The announcement was followed within weeks by the launch of two more MOOCs, by [[Andrew Ng]] and [[Jennifer Widom]]. Following the publicity and high enrollment numbers of these courses, Thrun started a company he named Udacity and [[Daphne Koller]] and Andrew Ng launched Coursera. Coursera subsequently announced university partnerships with University of Pennsylvania, [[Princeton University]], [[Stanford University]] and [[The University of Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Kow|first1 = Petrina|title = Speak To Influence: Perform Powerfully at Work|url = https://twofold.asia/courses/personal-development/communication/speak-to-influence-perform-powerfully-at-work|accessdate = 2 May 2015|publisher = twofold.asia}}{{dead link|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, Udacity launched its first MOOCs-for-credit, in collaboration with San Jose State University. In May 2013 the company announced the first entirely MOOC-based master's degree, a collaboration between Udacity, [[AT&amp;T]] and the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], costing $7,000, a fraction of its normal tuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/troyonink/2013/05/15/georgia-tech-udacity-shock-higher-ed-with-7000-degree/ |title=Georgia Tech, Udacity Shock Higher Ed With $7,000 Degree |work=Forbes |date=18 April 2012 |accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerned about the commercialization of online education, in 2012 MIT created the not-for-profit MITx.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = MITx on edX (MOOCs)|url = http://odl.mit.edu/beyond-campus/mitx-edx-moocs|publisher = [[MIT]] Office of Digital Learning|accessdate = 2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural course, 6.002x, launched in March 2012. Harvard joined the group, renamed edX, that spring, and [[University of California, Berkeley]] joined in the summer. The initiative then added the [[University of Texas System]], [[Wellesley College]] and [[Georgetown University]].

In September 2013, edX announced a partnership with Google to develop MOOC.org, a site for non-[[xConsortium]] groups to build and host courses. Google will work on the core platform development with edX partners. In addition, Google and edX will collaborate on research into how students learn and how technology can transform learning and teaching. MOOC.org will adopt Google's infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.edx.org/alert/edx-announces-partnership-google/1115 |title=Announces Partnership with Google to Expand Open Source Platform |publisher=edX |date=10 September 2013 |accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese [[Tsinghua University]] MOOC platform XuetangX.com (launched Oct. 2013) uses the Open edX platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.edx.org/blog/deeper-partnership-xuetangx-increase|title=A deeper partnership with XuetangX to increase quality education for Chinese students|work=edX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 2013 each MOOC tended to develop its own delivery platform. EdX in April 2013 joined with Stanford University, which previously had its own platform called Class2Go, to work on [[XBlock]] SDK, a joint open-source platform. It is available to the public under the [[Affero GPL]] open source license, which requires that all improvements to the platform be publicly posted and made available under the same license.&lt;ref name=edXPressRelease&gt;{{cite web|title=edX Takes First Step toward Open Source Vision by Releasing XBlock SDK |url=https://www.edx.org/press/edx-takes-first-step-toward-open-source|work=www.edx.org|publisher=edX|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stanford Vice Provost John Mitchell said that the goal was to provide the "[[Linux]] of online learning."&lt;ref name="Open Source"&gt;{{cite news|last=Young|first=Jeffrey R.|title=Stanford U. and edX Will Jointly Build Open-Source Software to Deliver MOOCs|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/stanford-u-and-edx-will-jointly-build-open-source-software-to-deliver-moocs/43301|accessdate=3 April 2013|newspaper=[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]|date=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is unlike companies such as Coursera that have developed their own platform.&lt;ref name="courserastack"&gt;{{cite web|title = What is Coursera's Stack?|url = http://www.quora.com/Coursera/What-is-Courseras-stack|publisher = Qoura|accessdate = 8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By November 2013, EdX offered 94 courses from 29 institutions around the world. During its first 13 months of operation (ending March 2013), Coursera offered about 325 courses, with 30% in the sciences, 28% in arts and humanities, 23% in information technology, 13% in business and 6% in mathematics.&lt;ref name="SA31313" /&gt; Udacity offered 26 courses. The number of courses offered has since increased dramatically: As of January 2016, Edx offers 820 courses, Coursera offers 1580 courses and Udacity offers more than 120 courses. According to FutureLearn, the British Council's Understanding IELTS: Techniques for English Language Tests has an enrollment of over 440,000 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FutureLearn delivers the largest MOOC ever as more than 440,000 learners convene for English language learning|url=https://about.futurelearn.com/press-releases/futurelearn-delivers-the-largest-mooc-ever-as-nearly-400000-learners-convene-for-english-language-learning/|website=Future Learn|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emergence of innovative courses ===
Early cMOOCs such as CCK08 and ds106 used innovative pedagogy, with distributed learning materials rather than a video-lecture format, and a focus on education and learning, and digital storytelling respectively&lt;ref name="THE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="downes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GROOM"/&gt;

Following the 2011 launch of three stanford xMOOCs, including ''Introduction Into AI'', launched by Sebastian Thrun and Peter Norvig&lt;ref name="NYT71712"/&gt; a number of other innovative courses have emerged. As of May 2014, more than 900 MOOCs are offered by US universities and colleges. As of February 2013 dozens of universities had affiliated with MOOCs, including many international institutions.&lt;ref name="NYT022013"&gt;{{cite news|title=Universities Abroad Join Partnerships on the Web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/21/education/universities-abroad-join-mooc-course-projects.html|accessdate=21 February 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=20 February 2013|author=Tamar Lewin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CHE022113&gt;{{cite news|title=Competing MOOC Providers Expand into New Territory—and Each Other's|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/competing-mooc-providers-expand-into-new-territory-and-each-others/42463|accessdate=21 February 2013|newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=21 February 2013|author=Steve Kolowich|format=blog by expert journalist}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some organisations operate their own MOOCs – including Google's Power Search.

A range of courses have emerged; "There was a real question of whether this would work for humanities and social science", said Ng. However, psychology and philosophy courses are among Coursera's most popular. Student feedback and completion rates suggest that they are as successful as math and science courses &lt;ref name=wsj1013/&gt; even though the corresponding completion rates are lower.&lt;ref name="in AIS Electronic Library AISeL"/&gt; 
 
In January 2012, University of Helsinki launched a Finnish MOOC in programming. The MOOC is used as a way to offer high-schools the opportunity to provide programming courses for their students, even if no local premises or faculty that can organize such courses exist.&lt;ref name="VihavainenMOOC2012"&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1145/2380552.2380603| chapter = Multi-faceted support for MOOC in programming| title = Proceedings of the 13th annual conference on Information technology education - SIGITE '12| page = 171| year = 2012| last1 = Vihavainen | first1 = A. | last2 = Luukkainen | first2 = M. | last3 = Kurhila | first3 = J. | isbn = 9781450314640}}&lt;/ref&gt; The course has been offered recurringly, and the top-performing students are admitted to a BSc and MSc program in Computer Science at the University of Helsinki.&lt;ref name="VihavainenMOOC2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MOOC dot Fi - Massive Open Online Courses|url=http://mooc.fi|publisher=mooc.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a meeting on E-Learning and MOOCs, Jaakko Kurhila, Head of studies for University of Helsinki, Department of Computer Science, claimed that to date, there has been over 8000 participants in their MOOCs altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kurhila|first1=Jaakko|title=Experiences from running a programming MOOC in Finland|url=http://www.aalto.fi/en/current/events/digi_breakfast_on-e-learning_and_moocs/|publisher=Aalto University|accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By June 2012 more than 1.5 million people had registered for classes through Coursera, Udacity or edX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/06/11/experts-speculate-possible-business-models-mooc-providers |title=Experts speculate on possible business models for MOOC providers |author=Steve Kolowich |publisher=Inside Higher Ed |date=11 June 2012| accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. the first 3 minutes of the video {{cite web|title=Daphne Koller: What we're learning from online education |url=https://www.ted.com/daphne_koller_what_we_re_learning_from_online_education |publisher=[[TED (conference)|TED]] |accessdate=23 April 2013 |date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, the range of students registered appears to be broad, diverse and non-traditional, but concentrated among English-speakers in rich countries. By March 2013, Coursera alone had registered about 2.8 million learners.&lt;ref name="SA31313"/&gt; By October 2013, Coursera enrollment continued to surge, surpassing 5 million, while edX had independently reached 1.3 million.&lt;ref name=wsj1013&gt;{{cite web|last=Fowler |first=Geoffrey A. |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303759604579093400834738972 |title=An early report card on MOOCs |work=Wall Street Journal |date=8 October 2013 |accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A course billed as "Asia's first MOOC" given by the [[Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]] through Coursera starting in April 2013 registered 17,000 students. About 60% were from "rich countries" with many of the rest from middle-income countries in Asia, South Africa, Brazil or Mexico. Fewer students enrolled from areas with more limited access to the internet, and students from the People's Republic of China may have been discouraged by Chinese government policies.&lt;ref name="HK MOOC"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sharma|first=Yojana|title=Hong Kong MOOC Draws Students from Around the World|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Hong-Kong-MOOC-Draws-Students/138723/|work=Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=22 April 2013}} reprinted from ''University World News''&lt;/ref&gt;

Koller stated in May 2013 that a majority of the people taking Coursera courses had already earned college degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Kolowich, [http://chronicle.com/article/In-Deals-With-10-Public/139533/?cid=at "In Deals With 10 Public Universities, Coursera Bids for Role in Credit Courses", ''Chronicle of Higher Education'' 30 May 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a Stanford University study of a more general group of students "active learners" – anybody who participated beyond just registering – found that 64% of high school active learners were male and 88% were male for undergraduate- and graduate-level courses.&lt;ref name="lytics"/&gt;

A study from Stanford University's Learning Analytics group identified four types of students: auditors, who watched video throughout the course, but took few quizzes or exams; completers, who viewed most lectures and took part in most assessments; disengaged learners, who quickly dropped the course; and sampling learners, who might only occasionally watch lectures.&lt;ref name="lytics"&gt;{{cite web|last=MacKay|first=R.F.|title=Learning analytics at Stanford takes huge leap forward with MOOCs|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2013/april/online-learning-analytics-041113.html|work=Stanford Report|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=22 April 2013|date=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They identified the following percentages in each group:&lt;ref name="Decon Diseng"&gt;{{cite web|title=Deconstructing Disengagement: Analyzing Learner Subpopulations in Massive Open Online Courses|url=http://www.stanford.edu/~cpiech/bio/papers/deconstructingDisengagement.pdf|work=LAK conference presentation|accessdate=22 April 2013|author=René F.

Jonathan Haber focused on questions of what students are learning and student demographics. About half the students taking US courses are from other countries and do not speak English as their first language. He found some courses to be meaningful, especially about reading comprehension. Video lectures followed by multiple choice questions can be challenging since they are often the "right questions." Smaller discussion boards paradoxically offer the best conversations. Larger discussions can be "really, really thoughtful and really, really misguided", with long discussions becoming rehashes or "the same old stale left/right debate."&lt;ref name="BG Haber"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bombardieri|first=Marcella|title=Can you MOOC your way through college in one year?|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2013/04/13/can-you-mooc-your-way-through-college-one-year-can-you-mooc-your-way-through-college-one-year/lAPwwe2OYNLbP9EHitgc3L/story.html|accessdate=23 April 2013|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MIT and Stanford University offered initial MOOCs in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. Since engineering courses need prerequisites so at the outset upper-level engineering courses were nearly absent from the MOOC list. Now several universities are presenting undergraduate and advanced-level engineering courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title= Adopting MOOCs for quality engineering education in India. |last= Phatak|first=D.

=== Educator experience ===
In 2013, the [[Chronicle of Higher Education]] surveyed 103 professors who had taught MOOCs. "Typically a professor spent over 100 hours on his MOOC before it even started, by recording online lecture videos and doing other preparation", though some instructors' pre-class preparation was "a few dozen hours." The professors then spent 8–10 hours per week on the course, including participation in discussion forums.&lt;ref name="Chron survey"/&gt;

The medians were: 33,000 students enrollees; 2,600 passing; and 1 teaching assistant helping with the class. 74% of the classes used automated grading, and 34% used peer grading. 97% of the instructors used original videos, 75% used open educational resources and 27% used other resources. 9% of the classes required a physical textbook and 5% required an e-book.&lt;ref name="Chron survey"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kolowich|first=Steven|title=The Professors Who Make the MOOCs|url=http://chronicle.com/article/The-Professors-Behind-the-MOOC/137905/#id=overview|accessdate=26 March 2013|newspaper=[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]|date=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="additional results"&gt;{{cite news|title=Additional Results From The Chronicle's Survey|url=http://chronicle.com/article/The-Professors-Behind-the-MOOC/137905/#id=results|accessdate=26 March 2013|newspaper=[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]|date=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike traditional courses, MOOCs require additional skills, provided by videographers, instructional designers, IT specialists and platform specialists. Georgia Tech professor Karen Head reports that 19 people work on their MOOCs and that more are needed.&lt;ref name=GTech&gt;{{cite news|last=Head|first=Karen|title=Sweating the Details of a MOOC in Progress|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/sweating-the-details-of-a-mooc-in-progress/43315|accessdate=6 April 2013|newspaper=[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]|date=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The platforms have availability requirements similar to media/content sharing websites, due to the large number of enrollees. MOOCs typically use [[cloud computing]] and are often created with    [[authoring system]]s. Authoring tools for the creation of MOOCs are specialized packages of [[educational software]] like [[Elicitus]], [[IMC Content Studio]] and [[Lectora]] that are easy-to-use and support e-learning standards like [[SCORM]] and [[Aviation Industry Computer-Based Training Committee|AICC]].

=== Completion rates ===

Despite their potential to support learning and education, MOOCs have a major concern related to attrition rates and course drop out. Even though the number of learners who enroll in the courses tends to be in the thousands range, only a very small portion of the enrolled learners complete the course. According to the visualizations and analysis conducted by Katy Jordan (2015),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.katyjordan.com/MOOCproject.html|title=MOOC completion rates|website=www.katyjordan.com|access-date=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the investigated MOOCs have a typical enrollment of 25,000, even though enrollment has reached a value up to ~230,000. Jordan reports that the average completion rate for such MOOCs is approximately 15%. Early data from Coursera suggest a completion rate of 7%–9%.&lt;ref name="KatW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=3109|title=MOOCs on the Move: How Coursera Is Disrupting the Traditional Classroom|date=7 November 2012|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|format=text and video|work=Knowledge @ Wharton|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coffrin et al.

(2013)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Diyi|last2=Sinha|first2=Tanmay|last3=Adamson|first3=David|last4=Rose|first4=Carolyn|title="Turn on, Tune in, Drop out": Anticipating student dropouts in Massive Open Online Courses|url=http://lytics.stanford.edu/datadriveneducation/papers/yangetal.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that even though there is a large proportion of students who drop out early on due to a variety of reasons, there is a significant proportion of the students who remain in the course and drop out later, thus causing attrition to happen over time.

Before analyzing some factors which is related to attrition rates and course drop out, one important thing should be keep in mind is that average completion rate for MOOCs is not a good indicator. Completion rate can not reflect the overall view of every student because different students have diverse purposes.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hew|first=Khe Foon|date=May 2016|title=Promoting engagement in online courses: What strategies can we learn from three highly rated MOOCS|url=|journal=British Journal of Educational Technology|volume=47|pages=320–341|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Khe&amp;nbsp;Foon&amp;nbsp;Hew (2016)&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; indicates that some students take part in the MOOCs just for interest or finding extrinsic value of course. They drop the course if the course can not satisfy their purpose. However, completion rate is objective enough to reflect engagement of students.

Much research has investigated why students drop out of MOOC courses or what factors could contribute to them dropping out. For example, Rosé et al. (2014)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosé|first=Carolyn Penstein|last2=Carlson|first2=Ryan|last3=Yang|first3=Diyi|last4=Wen|first4=Miaomiao|last5=Resnick|first5=Lauren|last6=Goldman|first6=Pam|last7=Sherer|first7=Jennifer|date=1 January 2014|title=Social Factors That Contribute to Attrition in MOOCs|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2556325.2567879|journal=Proceedings of the First ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale Conference|series=L@S '14|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=197–198|doi=10.1145/2556325.2567879|isbn=9781450326698}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigate how three social factors make predictions on student attrition, for students who participated in the course discussion forum. The authors found that students who serve as authorities in the community seem to be more committed to the community and thus less inclined to drop out the course. In addition, students who actively participated in the course since the first week were 35% less likely to drop out of the course, compared with the average population. Lastly, the analysis of the patterns of attrition in a sub community showed that attrition was related to the engagement of the particular students with one another. One interpretation of this finding according to Rosé et al. (2014)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; is that while participating in MOOCs, students create virtual cohorts who progress and engage with the material in similar ways. Thus, if students start dropping out, then that might cause other students to drop out as they might perceive the environment as less supportive or engaging without their peers.

Other studies focus on exploring how motivation and self-regulated learning could be related to MOOC dropout and attrition. Carson (2002)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Hendricks|first=Carson, Elaine|title=Self-directed learning and academic achievement in secondary online students|date=1 January 2012|publisher=University of Tennessee at Chattanooga|url=http://scholar.utc.edu/theses/11/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigated characteristics of self-directed learning in students of grades 8–12 who took online courses through a statewide online program. Two of the hypothesis that the study explored were whether there exist underlying distinct classes (categories) of self-regulated learners and if the membership in these classes was associated with measures such significantly different online course completion, online final grade, or GPA. The results show that there exist different latent classes of self-regulated learning within the population of online students, designated as high, moderate, and low self-directed learning. In addition, the results support the hypothesis that there is an association between the self-directed learning class the student belongs to with the significantly different course completion rate or course achievement (course achievement was measured by the completion of the online courses, the final online course grade and the cumulative GPA). In other words, course completion and self-directed learning in students were found to be significantly related.

One online survey published a "top ten" list of reasons for dropping out of a MOOC.&lt;ref name="Open culture 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=MOOC Interrupted: Top 10 Reasons Our Readers Didn’t Finish a Massive Open Online Course|url=http://www.openculture.com/2013/04/10_reasons_you_didnt_complete_a_mooc.html|work=Open Culture|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list involved reasons such as the course required too much time, or was too difficult or too basic. Reasons related to poor course design included "lecture fatigue" from courses that were just lecture videos, lack of a proper introduction to course technology and format, clunky technology and abuse on discussion boards. Hidden costs were cited, including required readings from expensive textbooks written by the instructor that also significantly limited students' access to learning material.&lt;ref name="in AIS Electronic Library AISeL" /&gt; Other non-completers were "just shopping around" when they registered, or were participating for knowledge rather than a credential. Other reasons for the poor completion rates include the workload, length and difficulty of a course.&lt;ref name="in AIS Electronic Library AISeL" /&gt; In addition, some participants participate peripherally ("lurk"). For example, one of the first MOOCs in 2008 had 2200 registered members, of whom 150 actively interacted at various times.&lt;ref&gt;Mackness, Jenny, Mak, Sui Fai John, and Williams, Roy [http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fss/organisations/netlc/past/nlc2010/abstracts/PDFs/Mackness.pdf "The Ideals and Reality of Participating in a MOOC"], Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Networked Learning 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides those factors cause the low completion rate in MOOCs, the inequality on receiving knowledge affected by different characters of individual also has huge influence on the consequence of completion rate. Actually, MOOC is not as fair as we expected. Russian researchers Semenova, T.V. and Rudakova, L.M (2016), indicate that MOOC is designed to decrease the unequal access to getting knowledge, but that doesn't mean every individual can enjoy the same equality in course completion rate. From their research, there are three main factors cause the inequality, which are degree of education, experience of MOOCs and gender. The survey shows that 18% high-education students complete the course while only 3% low-education students complete. To be more visualized, 84–88% students who have completed the course are high-educational. What's more, among students who have completed the course, 65–80% students have at least one experience of using online learning platform comparing to 6–31% students who have no experience . Gender also influence the completion rate, in general, 6%–7% more men than women complete the course because women are supposed to do household in many countries, which distract women's attention in learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Semenova|first=T.V.|last2=Rudakova|first2=L.M.|date=May 2016|title=Barriers to Taking Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs).|url=|journal=Russian Education &amp; Society|volume=58|pages=228–245|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effectiveness of MOOCs is an open question as completion rates are substantially less than traditional online education courses.&lt;ref name="Yousef" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Khaled M 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alraimi|first1=Khaled M.|last2=Zo|first2=Hangjung|last3=Ciganek|first3=Andrew P.|title=Understanding the MOOCs continuance: The role of openness and reputation|journal=Computers &amp; Education|date=January 2015|volume=80|pages=28–38|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2014.08.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alraimi et al. (2015) explained in their research model a substantial percentage of the variance for the intention to continue using MOOCs, which is significantly influenced by perceived reputation, perceived openness, perceived usefulness, and perceived user satisfaction. Perceived reputation and perceived openness were the strongest predictors and have not previously been examined in the context of MOOCs

However research indicates that completion rates is not the right metric to measure success of MOOCs. Alternate metrics are proposed to measure effectiveness of MOOCs and online learning.&lt;ref name="Khaled M 2014"/&gt;

This approach, he said, dispels 'the medieval set of myths' guiding teacher efficacy and student outcomes, and replaces it with evidence-based, 'modern, data-driven' educational methodologies that may be the instruments responsible for a 'fundamental transformation of education' itself".&lt;ref name="Librarians and the Era of the MOOC"&gt;{{cite news|title=Librarians and the Era of the MOOC|url=http://www.scilogs.com/scientific_and_medical_libraries/librarians-and-the-era-of-the-mooc/|accessdate=11 May 2013|work=SciLogs|date=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some view the videos and other material produced by the MOOC as the next form of the textbook. "MOOC is the new textbook", according to David Finegold of [[Rutgers University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Young|first=Jeffrey R.|title=The Object Formerly Known as the Textbook|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Dont-Call-Them-Textbooks/136835/|publisher=[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]|accessdate=14 March 2013|date=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of edX student habits found that certificate-earning students generally stop watching videos longer than 6 to 9 minutes. They viewed the first 4.4 minutes (median) of 12- to 15-minute videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holmes|first1=Lindsay|title=An Early Report Card on Massive Open Online Courses|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303759604579093400834738972|website=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some traditional schools blend online and offline learning, sometimes called flipped classrooms. Students watch lectures online at home and work on projects and interact with faculty while in class. Such hybrids can even improve student performance in traditional in-person classes. One fall 2012 test by San Jose State and edX found that incorporating content from an online course into a for-credit campus-based course increased pass rates to 91% from as low as 55% without the online component. "We do not recommend selecting an online-only experience over a blended learning experience", says Coursera's Andrew Ng.&lt;ref name=wsj1013/&gt;

Because of massive enrollments, MOOCs require instructional design that facilitates large-scale feedback and interaction. The two basic approaches are:

* Peer-review and group collaboration

So-called connectivist MOOCs rely on the former approach; broadcast MOOCs rely more on the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Steve. "[http://tofp.wordpress.com/2012/07/23/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-automated-assessment/ What we talk about when we talk about automated assessment]" 23 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; This marks a key distinction between [[Massive open online course#Connectivist design|cMOOCs]]  where the 'C' stands for 'connectivist', and xMOOCs where the x stands for extended (as in TEDx, edX) and represents that the MOOC is designed to be in addition to something else (university courses for example).&lt;ref name="xMOOC def"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://plus.google.com/109526159908242471749/posts/LEwaKxL2MaM | title=What the 'x' in 'xMOOC' stands for | date=9 April 2013 | accessdate=17 May 2014 | author=Downes, Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assessment can be the most difficult activity to conduct online, and online assessments can be quite different from the bricks-and-mortar version.&lt;ref name="DoF 1"&gt;[http://degreeoffreedom.org/mooc-components-assessment/ Degree of Freedom – an adventure in online learning], ''MOOC Components – Assessment'', 22 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Special attention has been devoted to proctoring and cheating.&lt;ref name=NYT030212&gt;{{cite news|last=Eisenberg|first=Anne|title=Keeping an Eye on Online Test-Takers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/technology/new-technologies-aim-to-foil-online-course-cheating.html?_r=1&amp;|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peer review is often based upon sample answers or [[Rubric (academic)|rubrics]], which guide the grader on how many points to award different answers. These rubrics cannot be as complex for peer grading as for teaching assistants. Students are expected to learn via grading others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wong|first=Michael|title=Online Peer Assessment in MOOCs: Students Learning from Students|url=http://ctlt.ubc.ca/2013/03/28/online-peer-assessment-in-moocs-students-learning-from-students/|work=Centre for Teaching, Learning and Technology Newsletter|publisher=University of British Columbia|accessdate=20 April 2013|date=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and become more engaged with the course.&lt;ref name="in AIS Electronic Library AISeL"/&gt; Exams may be proctored at regional testing centers. Other methods, including "eavesdropping technologies worthy of the C.I.A." allow testing at home or office, by using webcams, or monitoring mouse clicks and typing styles.&lt;ref name=NYT030212/&gt; Special techniques such as [[Computerized adaptive testing|adaptive testing]] may be used, where the test tailors itself given the student's previous answers, giving harder or easier questions accordingly.

"The most important thing that helps students succeed in an online course is interpersonal interaction and support", says Shanna Smith Jaggars, assistant director of [[Columbia University]]'s [[Community College Research Center]]. Her research compared online-only and face-to-face learning in studies of community-college students and faculty in Virginia and Washington state. Among her findings: In Virginia, 32% of students failed or withdrew from for-credit online courses, compared with 19% for equivalent in-person courses.&lt;ref name=wsj1013/&gt;

Assigning mentors to students is another interaction-enhancing technique.&lt;ref name=wsj1013/&gt; In 2013 Harvard offered a popular class, ''The Ancient Greek Hero'', instructed by [[Gregory Nagy]] and taken by thousands of Harvard students over prior decades. It appealed to alumni to volunteer as online mentors and discussion group managers. About 10 former teaching fellows also volunteered. The task of the volunteers, which required 3–5 hours per week, was to focus online class discussion.  The edX course registered 27,000 students.&lt;ref name=NYT032513&gt;{{cite news|title=Harvard Asks Graduates to Donate Time to Free Online Humanities Class By RICHARD PÉREZ-PEÑA Published:|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/26/education/harvard-asks-alumni-to-donate-time-to-free-online-course.html|accessdate=26 March 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=25 March 2013|author=Richard Perez-Pena}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Techniques for maintaining connection with students include adding audio comments on assignments instead of writing them, participating with students in the discussion forums, asking brief questions in the middle of the lecture, updating weekly videos about the course and sending congratulatory emails on prior accomplishments to students who are slightly behind.&lt;ref name=wsj1013/&gt; Grading by peer review has had mixed results. In one example, three fellow students grade one assignment for each assignment that they submit. The grading key or rubric tends to focus the grading, but discourages more creative writing.&lt;ref name="BG Haber"/&gt;

[[A. J. Jacobs]] in an op-ed in the ''[[New York Times]]'' graded his experience in 11 MOOC classes overall as a "B".&lt;ref name=AJJ&gt;{{cite news|last=Jacobs|first=A.J.|title=Two Cheers for Web U!|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/opinion/sunday/grading-the-mooc-university.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=23 April 2013|newspaper=New York Times, Sunday Review|date=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He rated his professors as '"B+", despite "a couple of clunkers", even comparing them to pop stars and "A-list celebrity professors." Nevertheless, he rated teacher-to-student interaction as a "D" since he had almost no contact with the professors. The highest rated ("A") aspect of Jacobs' experience was the ability to watch videos at any time. Student-to-student interaction and assignments both received "B-". Study groups that didn't meet, [[Troll (Internet)|trolls]] on message boards and the relative slowness of online vs. personal conversations lowered that rating. Assignments included multiple choice quizzes and exams as well as essays and projects. He found the multiple choice tests stressful and peer graded essays painful. He completed only 2 of the 11 classes.&lt;ref name=AJJ/&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR AJ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Making the most of MOOCs: the ins and outs of e-learning|url=https://www.npr.org/player/v2/mediaPlayer.html?action=1&amp;t=1&amp;islist=false&amp;id=178623872&amp;m=178623848|work=Talk of the Nation|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=23 April 2013|format=Radio interview and call-in|date=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Information architecture ==
When searching for the desired course the courses are usually organized by "most popular" or a "topical scheme". Courses planned for synchronous learning are structured as an exact organizational scheme called a [[Chronological organization scheme|chronological scheme,]] &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=information architecture for the web and beyond|last=Rosenfeld|first=Louis|publisher=O'Reilly|year=2015|isbn=978-1-491-91168-6|location=United States of America|pages=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Courses planned for [[asynchronous learning]]&amp;nbsp;are also presented as a chronological scheme, but the order the information is learned as a hybrid scheme. In this way it can be harder to understand the course content and complete, because they are not based on an existing [[mental model]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Industry ==

MOOCs are widely seen as a major part of a larger [[disruptive innovation]] taking place in higher education.&lt;ref name="avalanche"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barber|first=Michael|title=An Avalanche is Coming; Higher Education and the Revolution Ahead|publisher=[[Institute for Public Policy Research]] |location=London|page=71 |url=http://www.insidehighered.com/sites/default/server_files/files/FINAL%20Embargoed%20Avalanche%20Paper%20130306%20(1).pdf|authorlink=Sir Michael Barber |author2=Katelyn Donnelly |author3=Saad Rizvi |accessdate=14 March 2013|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Times HE"&gt;{{cite news|last=Parr|first=Chris|title=Fund ‘pick-and-mix’ MOOC generation, ex-wonk advises|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/fund-pick-and-mix-mooc-generation-ex-wonk-advises/2002535.article|accessdate=14 March 2013|newspaper=Times Higher Education (London)|date=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Watters|first=Audrey|title=Unbundling and Unmooring: Technology and the Higher Ed Tsunami|url=http://www.educause.edu/ero/article/unbundling-and-unmooring-technology-and-higher-ed-tsunami|work=Educause Review|accessdate=14 March 2013|date=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the many services offered under traditional university business models are predicted to become [[unbundling|unbundled]] and sold to students individually or in newly formed bundles.&lt;ref name=KCarey&gt;{{cite web|last=Carey|first=Kevin|title=Into the Future With MOOC's|date=3 September 2012|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Into-the-Future-With-MOOCs/134080/|publisher=[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NHarden&gt;{{cite web|last=Harden|first=Nathan|title=The End of the University as We Know It|url=http://the-american-interest.com/article.cfm?piece=1352|publisher=The American Interest|accessdate=26 March 2013|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These services include research, curriculum design, content generation (such as textbooks), teaching, assessment and certification (such as granting degrees) and student placement. MOOCs threaten existing business models by potentially selling teaching, assessment, or placement separately from the current package of services.&lt;ref name="avalanche"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zhu&gt;{{cite web|last=Zhu|first=Alex|title=Massive Open Online Courses – A Threat Or Opportunity To Universities?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2012/09/06/massive-open-online-course-a-threat-or-opportunity-to-universities/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=14 March 2013|date=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shirky&gt;{{cite news|last=Shirky|first=Clay|title=Higher education: our MP3 is the mooc|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/dec/17/moocs-higher-education-transformation|accessdate=14 March 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Barack Obama]] has cited recent developments, including the online learning innovations at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[Arizona State University]] and Georgia Institute of Technology, as having potential to reduce the rising costs of higher education.&lt;ref name=WhiteHouse&gt;{{cite news|title=Remarks by the President on College Affordability – Buffalo, NY|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/2013/08/22/president-obama-speaks-college-affordability#transcript|accessdate=22 August 2013|newspaper=[[The White House]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Mazoue, Director of Online Programs at [[Wayne State University]] describes one possible innovation:
{{Quote|The next disruptor will likely mark a tipping point: an entirely free online curriculum leading to a degree from an accredited institution. With this new business model, students might still have to pay to certify their credentials, but not for the process leading to their acquisition.

But how universities will benefit by "giving our product away free online" is unclear.&lt;ref name=NYT010613/&gt;
{{quote|No one's got the model that's going to work yet. I expect all the current ventures to fail, because the expectations are too high. People think something will catch on like wildfire.

=== Fee opportunities ===

In the [[freemium]] business model the basic product – the course content – is given away free. "Charging for content would be a tragedy", said Andrew Ng. But "premium" services such as certification or placement would be charged a fee – however financial aids are given in some cases.&lt;ref name=SA31313&gt;{{cite journal|last=Waldrop|first=M. Mitchell|author2=Nature magazine|title=Massive Open Online Courses, aka MOOCs, Transform Higher Education and Science|journal=Scientific American|date=13 March 2013|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=massive-open-online-courses-transform-higher-education-and-science|accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Course developers could charge licensing fees for educational institutions that use its materials. Introductory or "gateway" courses and some remedial courses may earn the most fees. Free introductory courses may attract new students to follow-on fee-charging classes. Blended courses supplement MOOC material with face-to-face instruction. Providers can charge employers for recruiting its students. Students may be able to pay to take a proctored exam to earn transfer credit at a degree-granting university, or for certificates of completion.&lt;ref name=NYT010613/&gt; Udemy allows teachers to sell online courses, with the course creators keeping 70–85% of the proceeds and [[intellectual property rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carey |first=Kevin |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Revenge-of-the-Underpaid/131919/ |title=Revenge of the Underpaid Professors |work=The Chronicle of Higher Education |date=20 May 2012 |accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coursera found that students who paid $30 to $90 were substantially more likely to finish the course. The fee was ostensibly for the company's identity-verification program, which confirms that they took and passed a course.&lt;ref name=wsj1013/&gt;

In February 2013 the American Council on Education (ACE) recommended that its members provide transfer credit from a few MOOC courses, though even the universities who deliver the courses had said that they would not.&lt;ref name=WSJ020713&gt;{{cite news|last=Korn|first=Melissa|title=Big MOOC Coursera Moves Closer to Academic Acceptance|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324906004578288341039095024|accessdate=8 March 2013|newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Wisconsin]] offered multiple, [[Competency-based learning|competency-based]] [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] and [[Master's degree|master's]] degrees starting Fall 2013, the first public university to do so on a system-wide basis. The university encouraged students to take online-courses such as MOOCs and complete assessment tests at the university to receive credit.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} As of 2013 few students had applied for college credit for MOOC classes.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} [[Colorado State University-Global Campus]] received no applications in the year after they offered the option.&lt;ref name="no takers"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kolowich|first=Steve|title=A University's Offer of Credit for a MOOC Gets No Takers|url=http://chronicle.com/article/A-Universitys-Offer-of-Credit/140131/|work=Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=25 July 2013|date=8 July 2013}} Udacity, which is offering an online master's degree in computer science in partnership with Georgia Tech, reported in October 2013 that applications for the term starting in January 2014 were more than double the number of applications that Georgia Tech receives for its traditional program. {{cite web|last=Belkin|first=douglas|title= First-of-Its-Kind Online Master’s Draws Wave of Applicants|url=http://stream.wsj.com/story/latest-headlines/SS-2-63399/SS-2-368104/|accessdate=31 October 2013|date=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic Partnerships is a company that helps public universities move their courses online. According to its chairman, Randy Best, "We started it, frankly, as a campaign to grow enrollment. But 72 to 84 percent of those who did the first course came back and paid to take the second course."&lt;ref name=NYT012313&gt;Tamar Lewin.

== Benefits ==

=== Improving access to Higher Education ===
MOOCs are regarded by many as an important tool to widen access to Higher Education (HE) for millions of people, including those in the [[Developing country|developing world]], and ultimately enhance their quality of life. MOOCs may be regarded as contributing to the democratisation of HE, not only locally or regionally but globally as well. MOOCs can help democratise content and make knowledge reachable for everyone. Students are able to access complete courses offered by universities all over the world, something previously unattainable. With the availability of affordable technologies, MOOCs increase access to an extraordinary number of courses offered by world-renowned institutions and teachers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002451/245122E.pdf|title=Making Sense of MOOCs: A Guide for Policy-Makers in Developing Countries|last=Patru|first=Mariana|last2=Balaji|first2=Venkataraman|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100157-4|location=|pages=17–18, 21–22, 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Providing an affordable alternative to formal education ===
The costs of tertiary education continue to increase because institutions tend to bundle too many services. With MOOCs, some of these services can be transferred to other suitable players in the public or private sector.&amp;nbsp;MOOCs are for large numbers of participants, can be accessed by anyone anywhere as long as they have an Internet connection, are open to everyone without entry qualifications and offer a full/complete course experience online for free.&lt;ref&gt;Mulder, F., &amp; Jansen. D. (2015). ''MOOCs for opening up education and the OpenupEd initiative''. In C. J. Bonk, M. M. Lee, T. C. Reeves, &amp; T. H. Reynolds (Eds.), MOOCs and open education around the world. New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Sustainable Development Goals ===
{{Main|Sustainable Development Goals}}

MOOCs can be seen as a form of open education offered for free through online platforms. The (initial) philosophy of MOOCs is to open up quality Higher Education to a wider audience. As such, MOOCs are an important tool to achieve Goal 4 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Offers a Flexible Learning Schedule ===
Certain lectures, videos, and tests through MOOCs can be accessed at any time compared to scheduled class times. By allowing learners to complete their coursework in their own time, this provides flexibility to learners based on their own personal schedules.&lt;ref name="hbr.org"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Samuel |first1=Alexandra |title=Collaborating Online Is Sometimes Better than Face-to-Face |url=https://hbr.org/2015/04/collaborating-online-is-sometimes-better-than-face-to-face |website=Harvard Business Review |accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Online Collaboration ===
The learning environments of MOOCs make it easier for learners across the globe to work together on common goals. Instead of having to physically meet one another, online collaboration creates partnerships among learners. While time zones may have an effect on the hours that learners communicate, projects, assignments, and more can be completed to incorporate the skills and resources that different learners offer no matter where they are located.&lt;ref name="hbr.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Challenges and criticisms ==

The MOOC Guide&lt;ref name="MoocGuide"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://moocguide.wikispaces.com/2.+Benefits+and+challenges+of+a+MOOC | title=Benefits and Challenges of a MOOC | publisher=MoocGuide | date=7 July 2011&lt;!-- 11:27&amp;nbsp;pm --&gt;| accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests six possible challenges for cMOOCs:
# Relying on user-generated content can create a chaotic learning environment
# [[Digital literacy]] is necessary to make use of the online materials
# The time and effort required from participants may exceed what students are willing to commit to a free online course
# Once the course is released, content will be reshaped and reinterpreted by the massive student body, making the course trajectory difficult for instructors to control
# Participants must self-regulate and set their own goals
#Language and translation barriers

These general challenges in effective MOOC development are accompanied by criticism by journalists and academics.

[[Robert Zemsky]] (2014) argues that they have passed their peak: "They came; they conquered very little; and now they face substantially diminished prospects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zemsky | first1 = Robert | year = 2014 | title = With a MOOC MOOC here and a MOOC MOOC there, here a MOOC, there a MOOC, everywhere a MOOC MOOC | jstor = 10.5325/jgeneeduc.63.4.0237 | journal = Journal of General Education | volume = 63 | issue = 4| pages = 237–243 | doi=10.1353/jge.2014.0029}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have pointed to a backlash arising from the tiny completion rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=What Are MOOCs Good For?|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/533406/what-are-moocs-good-for/|first=Pope|last=Justin|date=15 Dec 2014|publisher=MIT Technology Review|accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some{{who|date=February 2017}} dispute that the "territorial" dimensions of MOOCs&lt;ref name="TerritorialDimensions"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/globalhighered/territorial-dimensions-moocs | title=On the territorial dimensions of MOOCs | publisher=Inside Higher Ed | date=3 December 2012 | accessdate=4 February 2013 | author=Olds, Kris}}&lt;/ref&gt; have received insufficient discussion or data-backed analysis, namely: 1. the true geographical diversity of enrolls in/completes courses; 2. the implications of courses scaling across country borders, and potential difficulties with relevance and knowledge transfer; and 3. the need for territory-specific study of locally relevant issues and needs.

Other features associated with early MOOCs, such as open licensing of content, open structure and learning goals, and community-centeredness, may not be present in all MOOC projects.&lt;ref name="MOOC Misnomer"/&gt;

Effects on the structure of higher education were lamented, for example, by [[Moshe Y. Vardi]], who finds an "absence of serious pedagogy in MOOCs", and indeed in all of higher education. He criticized the format of "short, unsophisticated video chunks, interleaved with online quizzes, and accompanied by social networking."{{clarify|reason=Reads like a description rather than a critique.|date=October 2013}} An underlying reason is simple cost-cutting pressures, which could hamstring the higher education industry.&lt;ref name=Vardi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vardi|first=Moshe Y.|title=Will MOOCs destroy academia?|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=November 2012|volume=55|issue=11|page=5|url=http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2012/11/156587-will-moocs-destroy-academia/fulltext|accessdate=23 April 2013|doi=10.1145/2366316.2366317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The changes predicted from MOOCs generated objections in some quarters. The San Jose State University philosophy faculty wrote in an open letter to Harvard University professor and MOOC teacher [[Michael Sandel]]:

{{Quote|Should one-size-fits-all vendor-designed blended courses become the norm, we fear two classes of universities will be created: one, well-funded colleges and universities in which privileged students get their own real professor; the other, financially stressed private and public universities in which students watch a bunch of video-taped lectures.&lt;ref name="Dear Sandel"&gt;{{cite news|title=San Jose State to Michael Sandel: Keep your MOOC off our campus|url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/brainiac/2013/05/san_jose_state.html|accessdate=7 May 2013|newspaper=[[Boston Globe]]|date=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

[[Cary Nelson]], former president of the [[American Association of University Professors]] claimed that MOOCs are not a reliable means of supplying credentials, stating that "It’s fine to put lectures online, but this plan only degrades degree programs if it plans to substitute for them." Sandra Schroeder, chair of the Higher Education Program and Policy Council for the [[American Federation of Teachers]] expressed concern that "These students are not likely to succeed without the structure of a strong and sequenced academic program."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Basu |first=Kaustuv |url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/05/23/faculty-groups-consider-how-respond-moocs |title=Faculty groups consider how to respond to MOOCs |publisher=Inside Higher Ed |date=23 May 2012 |accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a 60% majority, the [[Amherst College]] faculty rejected the opportunity to work with edX based on a perceived incompatibility with their seminar-style classes and personalized feedback. Some were concerned about issues such as the "information dispensing" teaching model of lectures followed by exams, the use of multiple-choice exams and peer-grading. The [[Duke University]] faculty took a similar stance in the spring of 2013. The effect of MOOCs on second- and third-tier institutions and of creating a professorial "star system" were among other concerns.&lt;ref name="IHE 1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rivard|first=Ry|title=EdX Rejected|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/04/19/despite-courtship-amherst-decides-shy-away-star-mooc-provider|publisher=Inside Higher Education|accessdate=22 April 2013|date=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one alternative to MOOCs has advocates: [[Distributed open collaborative courses]] ([[DOCC]]) challenge the roles of the instructor, hierarchy, money and massiveness. DOCC recognizes that the pursuit of knowledge may be achieved better by not using a centralized singular syllabus, that expertise is distributed throughout all the participants and does not just reside with one or two individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Jaschik, [http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/08/19/feminist-professors-create-alternative-moocs#ixzz2duFJIkrX "Feminist Anti-MOOC"], Inside Higher Ed, 19 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another alternative to MOOCs is the [[Self-Paced Online Course (SPOC)]] which provides a high degree of flexibility. Students can decide on their own pace and with which session they would like to begin their studies. According to a report by [[Class Central]] founder Dhawal Shah, more than 800 self-paced courses have been available in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shah|first1=Dhawal|title=MOOCs in 2015: Breaking Down the Numbers|url=https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-12-28-moocs-in-2015-breaking-down-the-numbers|accessdate=28 December 2015|publisher=edSurge|date=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the purpose of MOOCs is ultimately to educate more people, recent criticisms include accessibility and a Westernized curriculum that lead to a failure to reach the same audiences marginalised by traditional methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gais|first1=Hannah|title=Is the developing world ‘MOOC’d out’?|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/7/mooc-education-developingworldivyleave.html|accessdate=19 July 2014|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MOOCs have been criticized for a perceived lack of academic rigor as well as the monetization strategies adopted by providers. In ''MOOCs: A University Qualification in 24 Hours?'' Michael Shea writes "By offering courses that are near-impossible to fail and charging up front fees for worthless certificates, Coursera is simply running a high-tech version of the kind of scams that have been run by correspondence colleges for decades."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shea|first1=Michael|title=MOOCs: A university qualification in 24 hours?|url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/tech/features/moocs|accessdate=16 October 2015|publisher=The Skinny|date=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The experience of English Language Learners (ELLs) in MOOCs ===
Language of instruction is one of the major barriers that ELLs face in MOOCs. In recent estimates, almost 75% of MOOC courses are presented in the English language, however, native English speakers are a minority among the world's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uchidiuno|first=Judith|last2=Ogan|first2=Amy|last3=Koedinger|first3=Kenneth R.|last4=Yarzebinski|first4=Evelyn|last5=Hammer|first5=Jessica|date=1 January 2016|title=Browser Language Preferences As a Metric for Identifying ESL Speakers in MOOCs|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2876034.2893433|journal=Proceedings of the Third (2016) ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale|series=L@S '16|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=277–280|doi=10.1145/2876034.2893433|isbn=9781450337267}}&lt;/ref&gt; This issue is mediated by the increasing popularity of English as a global language, and therefore has more second language speakers than any other language in the world. This barrier has encouraged content developers and other MOOC stakeholders to develop content in other popular languages to increase MOOC access. However, research studies show that some ELLs prefer to take MOOCs in English, despite the language challenges, as it promotes their goals of Economic, Social, and Geographic mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uchidiuno|first=Judith|last2=Ogan|first2=Amy|last3=Yarzebinski|first3=Evelyn|last4=Hammer|first4=Jessica|date=1 January 2016|title=Understanding ESL Students' Motivations to Increase MOOC Accessibility|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2876034.2893398|journal=Proceedings of the Third (2016) ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale|series=L@S '16|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=169–172|doi=10.1145/2876034.2893398|isbn=9781450337267}}&lt;/ref&gt; This emphasizes the need to not only provide MOOC content in other languages, but also to develop English language interventions for ELLs who participate in English MOOCs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7454">'''Multi-age classrooms''' or '''composite classes''' are classrooms with students from more than one [[grade level]]. They are created because of a pedagogical choice of a school or school district. They are different from split classes which are formed when there are too many students for one class - but not enough to form two classes of the same [[grade level]]. Composite classes are more common in smaller schools; an extreme form is the [[one-room school]].

Studies of the [[academic achievement|performance of students]] in composite classes shows their academic performance is not substantially different from those in single-grade classrooms; instead, outcomes tend to be a function of the teacher's performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Prevalence==
For a given number of students, composite classes allow greater administrative flexibility in allocating students to classes. This allows gender balancing, matching of student needs to teaching expertise, and balancing [[class size]]s. By allocating children to classes according to specific learning needs, it is possible to arrange classes with narrower ranges of abilities.

Schools composed exclusively of composite classes are increasingly common in Australian primary school education; they are not uncommon in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Composite classes often meet resistance, with parents often believing that their child is disadvantaged by being in one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Advocates of multi-age classrooms point to the lack of age stratification in workplaces, families or other social environments as a reason to create a similar environment in the classroom.

==Cited benefits==
Social benefits often cited are:
*Older children in a composite class get more leadership opportunities and frequently build self-esteem as a sort or role model to the younger class mates. Younger children aspire to do work like the older children in the class.
*The ability for a child to be educated by the one teacher for two years, creating a stronger relationship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Educational benefits often cited are:
*Because literacy and numeracy is taught in [[ability grouping|ability groups]], teachers need heightened awareness of individual student's capabilities - they must think of children as individuals.&lt;ref name="theage" /&gt;
*The techniques of [[classroom teaching]] and of [[individual teaching]] can be still applied.
*[[Learning by teaching]] occurs when students at different stages of learning can help each other with their work; children resolve differences in understanding of material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ednewsparent.org/teaching-learning/8157-ask-an-expert-are-multi-age-groupings-good-for-kids |title=Expert weighs in on mixed-age classroom settings  |first=Laura |last=Barr |work=ednewsparent.org |date=February 14, 2012 |accessdate=1 April 2012| publisher=EdNews Parent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Roopnarine | first1 = J.

*Composite classes provide a range of levels of work, so the needs of both talented children and slower learners can be catered for, while providing a supportive environment for both.&lt;ref name="theage" /&gt;

At any one time, both composite and single-level classes have groups of students at a variety of levels. This is part of the normal delivery of the curriculum. Education expectations are set at curriculum levels which span across two years; for example, see the [[Victorian Essential Learning Standards]]. Contemporary teaching and learning materials are developed for multi-age classes. By using them, teachers can introduce core concepts to the whole classroom, and then differentiate instruction for the range of learners in the classroom.

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

The students will be of a greater range of size, age and maturity which can have both positive and negative implications particularly in class sporting activities and playground interaction.

Once widespread across Europe in [[medieval university|medieval times]], they are now largely restricted to the oldest universities of Sweden and Finland, in part because of the violent conflicts between the nations in university towns in other countries. Medieval universities were large metropolitan centres with students from many different domestic and foreign regions. Students who were born within the same region usually spoke the same language, expected to be ruled by their own familiar laws, and therefore joined together to form the nations. The most similar comparison in the Anglo-world to the nation system is in [[Colleges within universities in the United Kingdom|the collegiate system of older British universities]] or [[fraternities]] at [[U.S.|American]] universities; however, both of these comparisons are imperfect. In Portugal and Brazil, there are fraternities called ''[[:pt:república estudantil|Repúblicas]]'', but this has nothing to do with the ''natio'' original concept of nations (they are created for lodgement purposes).{{clarify|date=September 2016}}

[[File:Four nations of the University of Paris.png|thumb|Map showing the territories covered by the four original nations of the [[University of Paris]] during the [[Middle Ages]].]]
In the [[University of Paris]] there were the [[French people|French]], [[Normans]], [[Picardy|Picards]], and the [[English people|English]], and later the [[Alemannia]]n nation. [[Jean Gerson]] was twice elected procurator for the French ''natio'' (i.e. the French-born students at the university) in 1383 and 1384, while studying [[theology]] at Paris. Also at Paris, Germanic speakers were grouped into a single nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WmouAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=%22+natio+Germanorum+et+Scotorum%22&amp;lr= |title=Miscellanea Scotica: Memoirs of the ancient alliance between France and ... - Google Books |via=[[Google Books]]|date= |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v6wQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=%22+natio+Germanorum+et+Scotorum%22&amp;lr= |title=Historical Tales of the Wars of Scotland, and of the Border Raids, Forays ... - Google Books |via=[[Google Books]]|date= |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The various nations in Paris often quarreled with one another; [[Jacques de Vitry]] wrote of the students:

"They affirmed that the English were drunkards and had tails; the sons of France proud, effeminate and carefully adorned like women. They said that the Germans were furious and obscene at their feasts; the Normans, vain and boastful; the Poitevins, traitors and always adventurers. The Burgundians they considered vulgar and stupid. The Bretons were reputed to be fickle and changeable, and were often reproached for the death of Arthur. The Lombards were called avaricious, vicious and cowardly; the Romans, seditious, turbulent and slanderous; the Sicilians, tyrannical and cruel; the inhabitants of Brabant, men of blood, incendiaries, brigands and ravishers; the Flemish, fickle, prodigal, gluttonous, yielding as butter, and slothful. After such insults from words they often came to blows."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.fordham.edu/Halsall/source/vitry1.asp |title=Medieval Sourcebook:  Jacques de Vitry: Life of the Students at Paris |date= |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===University of Oxford===
The students who attended the medieval university in Oxford arranged themselves into two nations who quarrelled constantly. These two nations were called the ''australes'' and the ''boreales''. The ''australes'' originated from south of the [[River Trent]] and was the more powerful of the two nations. The Welsh were also considered part of the  ''australes'', along with scholars from the Romance lands. The ''boreales'' came mainly from the north of England and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_eQxAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=Medieval%20oxford%20australes&amp;pg=PA96#v=onepage&amp;q=Medieval%20oxford%20australes&amp;f=false |title=Mobs: An Interdisciplinary Inquiry |date= |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nations at Oxford were eventually disbanded in 1274 in an effort to maintain peace in the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ZPx8TmNKVYC&amp;lpg=PA370&amp;dq=rashdall%20universities%20oxford%20nations&amp;pg=PA369#v=onepage&amp;q=nation&amp;f=false |title=Rasdhall's Universities of Europe, Vol 2 |date= |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This measure was largely unsuccessful and conflicts between the nations continued. One such as on 29 April 1388 when Welsh students, who were according to the chronicler [[Henry Knighton]] ''semper inquieti'', fought with their northern counterparts. The following year the ''boreales'' ran amok in the town chanting 'war, war, war, slay, slay, slay the Welsh dogs' killing and looting as they went, before rounding up the remaining Welsh students and urinating on them as they kissed the town's gateposts 'goodbye'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://themedievalstudent.wordpress.com/2012/05/06/war-war-war-slay-slay-slay-the-welsh-dogs/ |title=The medieval student |date= |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===University of Prague===
A similar division of students had been adopted at the [[Charles University in Prague]], where from its opening in 1347 the [[studium generale]] was divided among [[Bohemia|Bohemian]] (for local students), [[Bavaria|Bavarian]], [[Saxony|Saxon]], and [[Poland|Polish]] ''nations''. When there was not a "natio" of a student's birth territory, students were assigned to another nation.

===University of Leipzig===
When the [[University of Leipzig]] was established in 1409 by scholars from the University of Prague,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Zancke | first = Friedrich | title = Die Statutenbücher der Universität Leipzig aus den ersten 150 Jahren ihres Bestehens| url = https://archive.org/details/diestatutenbch00leip |publisher = S.

===University of Bologna===
In medieval [[Bologna]], there existed three separate universities. Two for the study of law, one for students from Italy (but not Bologna) the ''universitas citramontanorum'' and another for students from outside the peninsula the ''universitas ultramontanorum''. The final school was for the study of arts and medicine ''universitas artisarum et medicorum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Z1VBEbF0HAC&amp;lpg=PA298&amp;dq=university%20of%20bologna%20ultramontane&amp;pg=PA110#v=onepage&amp;q=nations&amp;f=false |title=A history of the universities in Europe, Volume 1 - Google Books |via=[[Google Books]]|date= |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ultramontane'' university was divided into fourteen different nations as early as 1265, such as the Gauls, Picards, Burgundians, Norman, Catalan, Hungarian, English, Gascon ''et al.'' whereas the ''citramontane'' university was split into three nations; the Romans, Tuscans and Lombards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E4-eLaN99PEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=medieval%20universities%20nations&amp;pg=PA184#v=onepage&amp;q=medieval%20universities%20nations&amp;f=false |title=Rashdall's Universities of Europe, Volume 1 - Google Books |via=[[Google Books]]|date= |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Universität Bologna Deutsche Nation.jpg|thumb|Students entering the ''Natio Germanica Bononiae'' (15th century)]]
The most important and powerful of the ''ultramontane'' [[University of Bologna]] was the German nation. One of its most famous members was [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] who, in 1496, enrolled into the ''Natio Germanorum'' (Natio of the Germans).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aEZrYxkjLkIC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=%22natio+germanorum%22&amp;sig=Dsr0AwrAI75N3ndXb5wHXWJaL4Q#PPA39,M1 |title=Documenta Copernicana: Urkunden, Akten und Nachrichten : Texte und Übersetzungen - Nicolaus Copernicus - Google Books |via=[[Google Books]]|date= |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=skMBAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22natio+germanorum%22&amp;dq=%22natio+germanorum%22&amp;pgis=1 |title=The Sleepwalkers - Arthur Koestler - Google Books |via=[[Google Books]]|date=2006-07-07 |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9r0RfQtpU6AC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=natio+copernicus&amp;sig=wZg0maLYGyn-N2P7-bO7_q6s0Jc#v=onepage&amp;q=Nationis%20Germanorum&amp;f=false |title=The Life of Copernicus (1473-1543) - Pierre Gassendi, Oliver Thill - Google Books |via=[[Google Books]]|date= |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; a privileged university organization that included German-speaking students from many regions of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote="Although great importance has frequently been ascribed to this fact, it does not by any means imply that Copernicus ever considered himself to be a German.

===University of Padua===
Students in the [[University of Padua]] were divided in 22 nations, which referred to the different territories ruled by the [[Republic of Venice]], to the biggest states of [[Italy]], and to the main states of [[Europe]]. Nations were: German (also called Alemannian), Bohemian, Hungarian, Provençal, Burgundian, Spanish, Polish, English, Scottish, Venetian, Overseas (Venetian Greek Islands), Lombard (East Lombardy and West Veneto), Trevisan (North and East Veneto), Friulian, Dalmatian, Milanese, Roman, Sicilian, Anconitan, Tuscan, Piedmontese and Genoan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unipd.it/archivio/archiviostorico/archivioantico/nationes.htm |title=Archivio antico - Archivio Generale di Ateneo - Università degli Studi di Padova |publisher=Unipd.it |date= |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finland==
{{Expand section|examples and additional citations|date=November 2010}} 
{{main article|Nations in Finnish universities}}
In [[Finland]], student nations ({{lang-fi|osakunnat}}) exist at the [[University of Helsinki]] and [[Aalto University School of Science and Technology]], where they are legally sanctioned and established in the mid-1600s and 1800s, respectively. Named after regions in Finland, students had to join according to their own geographical roots before membership became voluntary in 1937. Today, students can usually choose to join any nation. Both Finnish and Swedish speaking nations exist. Organizations termed ''nations'' exist also at other universities, although they are legally considered ''associations''. In Finland, student nations co-exist with a wide range of other student organizations, such as [[Student unionism in Finland|Student Unions]].

==Scotland==
{{main article|Nations in Scottish universities}}
Nations exist in some of the [[ancient universities]] in [[Scotland]], although their significance has largely been forgotten. Nations never existed at the [[University of Edinburgh]], and were abolished at St Andrews following discussions at the Royal Commission on the Universities of Scotland, which later led to the [[Universities (Scotland) Acts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/medieval_university.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605183405/http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/medieval_university.pdf |date=June 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/officersofmarisc00aberuoft/officersofmarisc00aberuoft_djvu.txt |title=Full text of "Officers of the Marischal College and University of Aberdeen, 1593-1860" |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Student nations continued into modern times at the [[University of Aberdeen]] and the [[University of Glasgow]] for the specific purpose of electing a [[Ancient university governance in Scotland#The Rector|Rector]] of the university.

==Sweden==
{{main article|Nations in Swedish universities}}
When [[Uppsala University]] was founded in 1477, the system of 'nationes' was copied from Sorbonne in Paris where a Scandinavian nation had existed. At the Swedish universities of [[Uppsala University|Uppsala]] and [[Lund University|Lund]], a [[Nations in Swedish universities|system of student nations]] (''nationer'') remains, and until June 30, 2010 students were required to enroll in a nation. Historically, also [[Tartu University]], founded in 1632 in then [[Swedish Estonia]] had nations. It is now voluntary, but still most of the students choose to remain members. The nations are named on regional lines, where the nations in Lund take their names from provinces and areas in southern Sweden, and those in Uppsala take their names from all over Sweden, except for the [[Scanian lands]], the traditional catchment area for Lund, which was founded in 1666 to provide higher education for the youth in the newly conquered areas. (Until 2010, there was a "Skånelandens nation" in Uppsala, but it had no activity, and only existed as a [[legal fiction]] for those students who did not wish to take part in the activities of the other nations.)

Traditionally, students were required to be members of the nations whose area one came from, but with one exception ([[Södermanlands-Nerikes nation]] at Uppsala, though international students are an exception to this), this requirement is now voided. The nations are in charge of the kinds of social activities which are at other universities normally handled by the student unions, such as bars, clubs, theatre companies, orchestras, sports societies, and also some housing.

The '''National Association for the Education of Young Children''' ('''NAEYC''') is a large [[nonprofit]] association in the [[United States]] representing [[early childhood education]] teachers, para-educators, center directors, trainers, college educators, families of young children, policy makers, and advocates.&lt;ref name="naeyc1"&gt;NAEYC. About NAEYC. Online July 2011. http://www.naeyc.org/content/about-naeyc&lt;/ref&gt; NAEYC is focused on improving the well-being of young children, with particular emphasis on the quality of educational and developmental services for children from birth through age 8.

==History==
[[File:NAEYC Building 001.JPG|thumb|left|The NAEYC building at 1313 L Street NW in Washington, D.C.]]
In the 1920s, concern over the varying quality of emerging nursery school programs in the United States inspired [[Patty Smith Hill]] to gather prominent figures in the field to decide how to best ensure the existence of high-quality programs.  Meeting in Washington, DC, the group negotiated the issue of a manual, called "Minimum Essentials for Nursery Education," that set out standards and methods of acceptable nursery schools.  Three years later, the group cemented the existence of a professional association of nursery school experts named the National Association for Nursery Education (NANE). NANE changed its name to NAEYC in 1964.

The association has existed for over 80 years.&lt;ref name="naeyc1"/&gt; Its holds two national early childhood conferences per year, the NAEYC Annual Conference &amp; Expo and the NAEYC National Institute for Early Childhood Professional Development.&lt;ref name="naeyc2"&gt;NAEYC. Conferences Overview. Online July 2011. http://www.naeyc.org/events&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The NAEYC Annual Conference &amp; Expo is the largest [[early childhood education]] conference in the world.&lt;ref name="naeyc2"/&gt; The association publishes periodicals, books, professional development materials, and resources, all of which relate to the education of young children. The association is also active in public policy work.  The association is well known for accrediting high-quality child care/preschool centers, and more than 10,000 centers, programs and schools have earned NAEYC [[School accreditation|Accreditation]].

==Accreditation==

NAEYC accredits early childhood programs according to health, safety and education standards it first launched in 1985 and reinvented and released in September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;NAEYC. Accreditation.Online March 2009.http://www.naeyc.org/accreditation/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Structure==

NAEYC has a structure of state and local Affiliates that are semi-autonomous but that are required to contribute part of the membership dues to the national organization. The Office of Affiliate Relations provides direct services to NAEYC State Affiliates, Local Affiliate Chapters, and Affiliate Alliances to support them in their efforts to build capacity and become high-performing, inclusive organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naeyc.org/affiliates List of Affiliates]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current Programs==

NAEYC provides many different programs to assist professionals who work to educate young children. They are a leading publisher of educational resources, which include books, videos and posters that can assist in the teaching of young children. NAEYC also publishes two scholarly journals to help early childhood professionals and parents stay informed about the latest research on educating children age 0-8. These journals are ''Young Children'' and ''Early Childhood Research Quarterly.'' In 2007, NAEYC also developed ''Teaching Young Children'', a magazine written for preschool teachers.  The magazine provides useful, research-based ideas that teachers can use in their classrooms. Every year the NAEYC offers several conferences where participants can learn about and receive professional development in their field as well as focus on the improvements that have been made in the practices, policies and research.

NAEYC goes beyond publications, conferences and videos, and offers a program called “Supporting Teachers, Strengthening Families” that is designed to assist in the fight to prevent child abuse and promote healthy social and emotional development in young children.  This program works by teaching the educators how to better communicate with the families of their students.  Another important program sponsored by the NAEYC is the [http://www.naeyc.org/woyc “Week of the Young Child”].  This is a week-long promotion every spring that brings public awareness to the importance of early childhood development and education.

==Policy and Advocacy==

NAEYC encourages its supporters to be informed of current issues and legislation that affect the lives of young children. At the NAEYC Children's Champions Action Center,&lt;ref&gt;NAEYC Children's Champions Action Center. http://capwiz.com/naeyc/home/&lt;/ref&gt; individuals can find information about the federal legislative process, learn how to contact members of Congress, and see the daily agenda for the House and the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://capwiz.com/naeyc/home/ |title=NAEYC Action Center |publisher=Capwiz.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NAEYC believes that our nation is at a crossroads. An integrated system of early childhood care and education that includes comprehensive approaches that directly involve families and communities in program design, implementation, and evaluation must be developed. NAEYC believes Americans can invest now in our children and families and enjoy long-term savings, with a more vibrant nation of healthy, achieving children and more stable families. Or, they can fail to make the investment and pay the price: increased delinquency, greater educational failures, lowered productivity, less economic competitiveness, and fewer adults prepared to be effective, loving parents to the next generation of children.

Federal, state and local government, communities, parents, and the private sector must share in the responsibility of ensuring the well-being of children and families.

In order to keep the programs going, NAEYC members must pay dues for funding of the programs they run. In September 2012, the NAEYC members at that time received a letter/e-mail regarding a due increase. This was the first time since 2000 that there was an increase in dues.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, Jerlean1.

==Journals, Publications and Position Statements==

The following periodic publications are released and sponsored by NAEYC:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naeyc.org/publications |title=Publications &amp;#124; National Association for the Education of Young Children |publisher=NAEYC |date= |accessdate=2013-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Young Children'''

''Young Children'' is a peer reviewed journal published bi-monthly by the National Association for the Education of Young Children. In this journal, issues are organized around topical clusters that devote special attention to issues in the field of early childhood education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naeyc.org/yc/ |title=National Association for the Education of Young Children &amp;#124; NAEYC YC &amp;#124; Young Children Journal |publisher=Naeyc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Teaching Young Children'''

''Teaching Young Children'' is a magazine specifically designed for preschool teachers.  It highlights current thinking on best practices in early childhood education, innovations in the field, research and its implications, and interesting ideas for and from preschool teachers. The articles and other features reinforce the accreditation criteria for the NAEYC Early Childhood Program Standards on Relationships and Teaching and encourage effective teaching in the preschool years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naeyc.org/tyc/ |title=National Association for the Education of Young Children &amp;#124; NAEYC TYC &amp;#124; Teaching Young Children Magazine |publisher=Naeyc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Early Childhood Research Quarterly'''

''Early Childhood Research Quarterly'' is a research journal that is published four times a year, and contains current research in early childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naeyc.org/publications/ecrq |title=Early Childhood Research Quarterly &amp;#124; National Association for the Education of Young Children |publisher=NAEYC |date= |accessdate=2013-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these periodicals, NAEYC produces formal position statements from time to time to "state the Association's position on issues related to early childhood education practice, policy, and/or professional development for which there are controversial or critical opinions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naeyc.org/positionstatements NAEYC Position Statements and Standards]. Retrieved 13 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; These position statements are typically produced by NAEYC to include in-depth discussion of specific issues such as [http://www.naeyc.org/positionstatements/learning_standards Early Learning Standards], [http://www.naeyc.org/positionstatements/psAssocOfTeacherEducators Teacher Certification] or [http://www.naeyc.org/files/naeyc/file/positions/PSMEVI98.PDF Media Violence]. In a few instances, NAEYC has issued position statements jointly with other authorities. A recent example is the 2012 position statement titled "[http://www.naeyc.org/content/technology-and-young-children Technology and Interactive Media as Tools in Early Childhood Programs Serving Children from Birth through Age 8]", produced jointly with the [[Fred Rogers Center for Early Learning and Children's Media]] at Saint Vincent College.

'''Caring for Children in Low-Income Families: A Substudy of the National Child Care Survey, 1990'''

''Caring for Children in Low-Income Families''  is a study that NAEYC conducted with The Urban Institute in 1990 on affordable child care facilities for low- income families. This book explores multiple different aspects of the lives of low-income children and day care. The study also examines aspects of the family lives. For example, whether a home has a single parent, two parents, unemployed parents, or other odd family situations and how that effects the children and their abilities to receive proper education. This was a very thorough and detailed study conducted by NAEYC and it helped them to better suit their own child care facilities to adapt to the needs of low-income families.&lt;ref&gt;Brayfield, April A., Sandra L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4628">'''Nawojka''' (pronounced: {{IPAc-pl|n|a|'|w|o|I|k|a}}; 14th-century &amp;ndash; 15th-century) was a legendary medieval [[Poland|Polish]] woman known to have dressed as a boy in order to study at the [[Jagiellonian University|University of Kraków]] in the 15th century. She later became a nun. She is considered to be the first female student and teacher in Poland.

==Overview==
The story of her was first told by the [[abbot]] [[Martin of Leibitz]] (d. 1464) in [[Vienna]] in about 1429.&lt;ref name=sunshine&gt;
{{cite web
 |url         = http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/czech/poles1.html

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several different versions of the legend.

According to one version, she was a daughter of a teacher in a church school in [[Gniezno]], schooled by her father, who decided to continue her studies using any means necessary. According to another version, she was a girl who inherited a fortune when orphaned. In yet another variant of the story&lt;ref name=dobrzyn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webnews.textalk.com/pl/article.php?id=12514|title=The Legend of Nawojka, the First Polish Woman Student}}&lt;/ref&gt;("[this] claim is as well documented as any other") she came from [[Dobrzyń nad Wisłą]].
In any case, dressed as a boy, she enrolled at the University of Kraków in the name of Andrzej (or Jakub; two versions of the name she used are reported). At that time it was forbidden for women to attend universities.

==Discovery==
Nawojka successfully fooled everyone and studied for two years, making herself a name as a great scholar and a serious student. According to a possibly later addition to the story,
she was offered work as a [[domestic worker|domestic]] assistant to one of the professors, but declined: at the time servants were expected to accompany their masters to the public bath.

One day, she was exposed as a woman. The versions differ here again: according to one, two soldiers wagered that the student walking by was in fact a woman, and exposed her; according to the second, she was found by a son of [[wójt]] from Gniezno who joined the school; according to the third one, she fell ill and a doctor examining her found out the truth.

When she was brought before the authorities to explain why she had disguised her gender, she simply answered: "For the will of learning". When they interrogated her fellow-students and professors they could find no one to accuse her of immoral conduct. Her record as a student was excellent. She was not convicted of any crime, but the judges did not want to acquit her entirely. According to Martin of Leibitz, she asked to be taken to a convent. She took her vows there, became a teacher and a leader of the convent school, and eventually the [[abbess]].

This story may or may not be true. Some historians say that if it is true, her time at the university was about 1407-1409.

==Legacy==
The Jagiellonian University did not allow women to study until 1897&lt;ref name=uj&gt;
"in 1897 first female students were admitted to study pharmacy" ''from:''

, and to hold academic positions until 1906. The university's first women's [[dormitory]], opened in 1936, was named after Nawojka. One of the streets in Kraków is also named after her.

'''OER Commons''' is a freely accessible online library that allows teachers and others to search and discover [[open educational resources]] (OER) and other freely available instructional materials.

==History==
OER Commons, created by the [[Institute for the Study of Knowledge Management in Education]], was developed to serve curriculum experts and educators in discovering [[open education]]al resources (OER) and collaborating around the use, evaluation, and improvement of those materials.&lt;ref name="ccblog"&gt;{{Cite web |author= Tim Vollmer |title= ISKME’s Lisa Petrides: Open Education and Policy |date=June 29, 2010 |work= Creative Commons Blog |url= https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/22608 |accessdate= October 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Resources on the site can be searched and filtered using an expanded set of descriptive data, including conditions of use. Teachers, students, and others enrich this "[[metadata]]" when they tag, rate, and review materials, and share what works for them.

In 2007, with a grant from the [[William and Flora Hewlett Foundation]], OER Commons opened as a [[digital library]] and intermediary for openly licensed and freely available content. By aggregating resources and standardizing metadata from OER content providers, the site supports knowledge sharing and access to teaching and learning materials, strategies, and curricula online. 
Individual educators submit their own contributions which  are curated. Materials are reviewed for quality and alignment to standards and shared primarily using [[Creative Commons]] licenses.&lt;ref name="ccblog" /&gt;

In a second phase, beginning in 2009, ISKME developed an initiative for teacher professional development program to support educators in finding and using OER supported by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the [[Ford Foundation]]. As part of  its teacher training program,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EMxCgIGYUI ISKME's OER Commons Teacher Training Initiative]. 2011-12. Retrieved 2012-10-31&lt;/ref&gt; ISKME trained educators from over 25 countries to use OER through workshops and summer academies, including ISKME's '''Teachers as Makers Academies'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iskme.org/our-ideas/iskmes-teachers-makers-academy Teachers as Makers Academies]. 2012-3. Retrieved 2012-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
ISKME’s OER research revealed how teachers’ exposure to OER, tools and professional development cultivates collaboration among teachers, as well as new conversations and reflection about teaching practices and roles.&lt;ref name="Pet2010"&gt;Petrides, L. and Jimes, C. (2010). Field Building in the Arts and Social Justice: Engaging Teachers, Learners, and Practitioners in the Collaborative Development and Use of Open Educational Resources. Working paper, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Petrides et al., 2011&lt;ref name="Pet2011"&gt;Petrides, L., Jimes, C., Middleton-Detzner, C., Walling, J. and Weiss, S. Open textbook adoption and use: Implications for teachers and learners, Open Learning: The Journal of Open, Distance and E-Learning, Vol. 26, Issue 1, 39. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, research conducted on the impact of teachers’ participation in ISKME’s own OER training network revealed that engagement with OER reduced teacher isolation (Petrides &amp; Jimes, 2010&lt;ref name="Pet2010" /&gt;), as well as expanded the role of teachers in becoming more active innovators as they shared, collaborated and learned from one another (Petrides et al., 2011&lt;ref name="Pet2011" /&gt;). This work also revealed the role that OER teacher champions play in sharing the benefits of OER with colleagues and supporting the knowledge sharing, collaboration, and use of OER in online OER communities (ISKME, 2008;&lt;ref&gt;ISKME. Creating, Doing, and Sustaining OER: Lessons from Six Open Educational Resource Projects, White paper, Half Moon Bay, CA. 2008. [http://wiki.oercommons.org/mediawiki/index.php http://wiki.oercommons.org/mediawiki/index.php]&lt;/ref&gt; Petrides &amp; Jimes, 2010;&lt;ref name="Pet2010" /&gt; Petrides et al., 2011&lt;ref name="Pet2011" /&gt;).

ISKME’s OER research also explored OER as a vehicle for disseminating adaptable curricula that support learner-centric approaches to pedagogy. ISKME’s evaluation of the Community College Open Textbook Project revealed that study habits improved when learners were able to interact with open course material, and that students’ use of open textbooks cultivated new, self-directed learning behaviors (Petrides et al., 2011&lt;ref name="Pet2011" /&gt;).

Finally, ISKME’s research revealed the role that collaboration plays in supporting the creation of open educational resources. Specifically, ISKME’s study of authors who created content within the open repository Connexions revealed how as content creation group size increased beyond one author, the probability that users stayed with Connexions (and continued to create content) increased with it (Petrides et al., 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Petrides, L., Nguyen, L., Jimes, C., and Karaglani, A. Open educational resources: Inquiring into author use and reuse. International Journal of Technology Enhanced Education, Vol. 1, No. 1-2: 98-117. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology and design==

ISKME’s technology platform, tools, and metadata enhancement in its work with OER Commons are designed to support an open platform that serves as a knowledge base for content providers and platform developers, particularly related to accessibility and inclusive design. Metadata, data that describes a resource, and in the case of open educational resources, includes descriptors such as title, author, material type, and material license. Metadata standards provide a template for OER providers to share their resources with other providers. OER Commons receives feeds of OER in [[Dublin Core]] (DC), [[IEEE]]'s [[Learning Object Metadata]] (LOM), and [[RSS]].  OER Commons provide targets to other providers to harvest content in these formats.

Partnered with the Inclusive Design Research Centre since 2010 to incorporate FLOE components into the OER Commons platform, ISKME’s efforts combine OER discovery and enhancement tools and processes with FLOE’s personalized network-delivered accessibility standards and tools.

In 2012, ISKME released Open Author, an authoring and remixing environment to support the creation and adaption of multi-media accessible OER and enable collaborative workflows of content reviewers and creators. The authoring environment produces OER that is accessible using a broad range of assistive technology devices such as screen readers.

To support user contributions, in 2010 ISKME released the OER-Connector browser plug-in on [[GitHub]] that enables users to add resources to OER Commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= OER-Connector |date= August 22, 2010 |format=Project page  |work= GitHub |url= https://github.com/ISKME/oer-connector |accessdate= October 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To support interoperability, OER Commons is an experimental node in the Learning Registry, a joint [[US Department of Education]] and [[US Department of Defense]] initiative to support educational content and platform interoperability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= ISKME / OER Commons |work= Learning Registry contributor page |url= http://learningregistry.org/iskme-oer-commons |accessdate= October 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OER Commons contains custom curated resource collections, or microsites. Within a microsite, OER is presented in the context of customized taxonomies to categorize and describe relevant OER. In 2011, ISKME announced the Green Micro-site with Greek partner Agro-Know. It is an aggregation of sustainability-related learning resources and features  interdisciplinary lesson plans such as STEAM ([[Science Technology Engineering Art and Math]]) resources.

The OER Commons infrastructure facilitates evaluation of content and alignment to quality rubrics and standards. Starting in 2011, OER Commons provides an embedded [[Common Core State Standards]] alignment tool and Achieve OER Rubric to support state-level curriculum committees as well as individual instructors to review content for quality and alignment and to collaboratively address gaps in content collections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.achieve.org/oer-rubrics. Achieve OER Rubric.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
ISKME was named an Education Laureate by the [[San Jose Tech Museum of Innovation]] in 2007 for OER Commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Institute for the Study of Knowledge Management in Education, OER Commons |year= 2007 |work= Tech Award Laureates |url= http://thetechawards.thetech.org/the-laureates/stories/1444 |accessdate= October 23, 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131102000210/http://thetechawards.thetech.org/the-laureates/stories/1444 |archivedate= November 2, 2013 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, ISKME was named a finalist in the '''[[Qatar Foundation]] [[The WISE Awards|World Innovation Summit for Education (WISE) Awards]]''' for its OER Commons teacher professional development programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/2010-wise-awards-honor-educational-excellence-109030214.html 2010 WISE Awards Honor Educational Excellence].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5568">'''Overlearning''' refers to practicing newly acquired skills beyond the point of initial mastery.  The term is also often used to refer to the [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] theory that this form of practice leads to [[automaticity]] or other beneficial consequences.

== Early studies ==
[[Memory]] researcher [[Herman Ebbinghaus]] performed classical overlearning studies in the late 1890s.&lt;ref name=Murphy&gt;{{cite book|last=Murphy|first=Gardner|title=An Historical Introduction to Modern Psychology|year=1929|publisher=International Library of Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CGs04j1ypooC&amp;pg=PA445&amp;lpg=PA445&amp;dq=murphy+ebbinghaus+historical+introduction+to+modern+psychology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jBNvVC9PuS&amp;sig=GI2yi_uuujOnG2KZufiSb18iSs8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3iKRUcLMMpSQ8wSu4YGAAg&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=murphy%20ebbinghaus%20historical%20introduction%20to%20modern%20psychology&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He noticed that memory for learned material decreased over time (see also [[forgetting curve]]). Ebbinghaus recognized that lists of nonsense syllables became more difficult to recall over time, and some lists required more review time to regain 100% recall. He defined '''overlearning''' as the number of repetitions of material after that material can be 100% recalled.&lt;ref name=Murphy /&gt;

== Contemporary work ==
A 1992 [[meta-analysis]] suggested that overlearning does significantly affect recall over time. It also concluded that the size of this effect may be moderated by the amount of overlearning, task type, and length of retention.&lt;ref name="Driskel et al."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Driskell|first=James E.|author2=Willis, R. P. |author3=Copper, C. |title=Effect of Overlearning on Retention|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|year=1992|volume=77|issue=5|pages=615–622|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.77.5.615}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meta-analysis included 15 studies. These 15 studies tested overlearning effects on physical and cognitive tasks. Both types of task showed an effect of overlearning. The effect size for physical tasks was smaller than the effect size for cognitive tasks.&lt;ref name="Driskel et al." /&gt; The amount of overlearning affected retention: more overlearning led to more retention on both types of task.&lt;ref name="Driskel et al." /&gt;  The length of the retention interval also affected overlearning, but the effects were different for physical and cognitive tasks. Whereas participants overlearning physical tasks increased in ability during the retention interval, participants who overlearned cognitive tasks decreased in recall ability over time.&lt;ref name="Driskel et al." /&gt;

Some recent studies explicitly examined the interaction of overlearning with retention interval, and concluded that the effects of overlearning tend to be fairly short-lived.&lt;ref name="Rohrer &amp; Taylor"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rohrer|first=Doug|author2=Taylor, K.|title=The Effects of Overlearning and Distributed Practise on the Retention of Mathematics Knowledge|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|year=2006|volume=20|pages=1209–1224|doi=10.1002/acp.1266}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohrer et al. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rohrer|first=Doug|author2=Taylor, K. |author3=Pashler, H. |author4=Wixted, J. T. |author5=Cepeda, N. J. |title=The Effect of Overlearning on Long-Term Retention|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|year=2004|volume=19|pages=361–374|doi=10.1002/acp.1083}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overlearning may be more useful in instances when learners only need short-term retention of the material.&lt;ref name="Rohrer et al. 2004" /&gt;

=== Overlearning geography facts and word definitions ===
In one study, researchers examined the effects of overlearning [[geography]] facts or word definitions.&lt;ref name="Rohrer et al. 2004"/&gt;  After one week, overlearners recalled more geography facts and word definitions than non-overlearners, but this improvement gradually disappeared after the study.&lt;ref name="Rohrer et al. 2004"/&gt; This research suggests that overlearning may be an inefficient study method for long-term retention of geography facts and word definitions.&lt;ref name="Rohrer et al. 2004" /&gt; Overlearning improves short-term retention of material, but learners must also spend more time studying. Over time the improvements created by overlearning fade, and the learner is no better off than someone who did not spend time overlearning the material.&lt;ref name="Rohrer et al. 2004" /&gt;

=== Overlearning mathematics ===
In another study, researchers compared the effects of overlearning and distributed practice on [[mathematics]] knowledge.&lt;ref name="Rohrer &amp; Taylor"/&gt; Distributed practice refers to practice that is spaced over time. In Experiment 1, participants completed 10 math problems either all at once or distributed across two sessions. Participants in the distributed practice condition performed no differently from participants in the single-session condition one week later, but distributed practice participants did perform better than single-session participants four weeks later. In Experiment 2, participants completed either three or nine practice problems in one sitting. When participants were retested one or four weeks later, no differences were found between three-problem and nine-problem participants. Researchers found no effect of overlearning on mathematics [[Recall (memory)|retention]].&lt;ref name="Rohrer &amp; Taylor"/&gt;

One of the most visible approaches to '''peer learning''' comes out of [[cognitive psychology]], and is applied within a "mainstream" [[education]]al framework: "Peer learning is an educational practice in which students interact with other students to attain educational goals."&lt;ref name="peer-learning-book"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, it can be compared to the practices that go by the name [[cooperative learning]]. However, other contemporary views on peer learning relax the constraints, and position "'''peer-to-peer learning'''" as a mode of "learning for everyone, by everyone, about almost anything."&lt;ref name=dml-schmidt&gt;Jeff Brazil, May 23, 2011, [http://dmlcentral.net/blog/jeff-brazil/p2pu-learning-everyone-everyone-about-almost-anything P2PU: Learning for Everyone, by Everyone, about almost Anything]&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether it takes place in a [[Formal learning|formal]] or [[Informal learning|informal]] learning context, in small groups or [[Social peer-to-peer processes|online]], peer learning manifests aspects of [[self-organization]] that are mostly absent from [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] models of teaching and learning.

==Connections with other practices==
=== Constructivism===
In his 1916 book, [[Democracy and Education]], [[John Dewey]] wrote, “Education is not an affair of 'telling' and being told, but an active and constructive process.” In a later essay, entitled "Experience and Education",&lt;ref&gt;John Dewey, [http://ruby.fgcu.edu/courses/ndemers/colloquium/ExperiencEducationDewey.pdf Experience and Education]&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey went into greater detail about the science of child development and developed the basic [[Constructivism (learning theory)|Constructivist]] theory that knowledge is created through experience, rather than passed down from teacher to student through rote memorization.  Soviet psychologist [[Lev Vygotsky]], who developed the concept of the [[Zone of Proximal Development]], was another proponent of constructivist learning: his book, ''Thought and Language'', provides evidence that students learn better through collaborative, meaningful problem-solving activities than through solo exercises.

The three distinguishing features of constructivist theory are claims that:&lt;ref name=akhras-and-self&gt;{{Cite book

| last=Akhras

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Learning occurs within a context that is itself part of what is learned
* Knowing and doing cannot be separated
* Learning is a process that is extended over time
These are clearly meaningful propositions in a social context with sustained relationships, where people work on projects or tasks that are collaborative or otherwise shared.

Educational Psychology Professor Alison King explains in "Promoting Thinking Through Peer Learning"&lt;ref name=alisonking&gt;Alison King, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1477535?seq=4 Promoting Thinking Through Peer Learning]&lt;/ref&gt; that peer learning exercises as simple as having students explain concepts to one another are proof of social constructivism theory at work; the act of teaching another individual demands that students “clarify, elaborate on, and otherwise reconceptualize material.” Joss Winn, Senior Lecturer in Educational Research at University of Lincoln, proposes that schools radically redefine the teacher-student relationship to fit this constructivist theory of knowledge in his December 2011 paper, "Student as Producer".&lt;ref name=winn&gt;Joss Winn, [http://joss.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/2011/01/28/pedagogy-technology-and-student-as-producer/ Student as Producer]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Rogers]]' "Personal Thoughts on Learning"&lt;ref name=carlrogers&gt;[http://www.panarchy.org/rogers/learning.html Carl Rogers' "Personal Thoughts on Learning"]&lt;/ref&gt; focus on the individual’s experience of effective learning, and eventually conclude that nearly the entire traditional educational structure is at odds with this experience. Self-discovered learning in a group that designates a facilitator is the “new approach” Rogers recommends for education.

In general, peer learning may adapt [[constructivist teaching methods|constructivist]] or [[discovery learning]] methods for the peer-to-peer context: however, peer learning typically manifests constructivist ideas in a more informal way, when [[learning]] and [[collaboration]] are simply applied to solve some real shared problem.

===Critical pedagogy===

[[Critical pedagogy]] engages students and instructors in analyzing and critiquing power structures around them. The most influential scholar in the development of this field was [[Paulo Freire]], whose book [[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]] described the traditional teaching framework as a “banking system” in which students are thought of as empty vessels to be filled with knowledge and concepts.  Instead, Freire advocated a more equitable relationship between teachers and students, one in which information is questioned and situated in political context, and all participants in the classroom work together to create knowledge.

Freire’s vision for dialogical education, where learning is situated within students’ lived experience, has been commonly deemed idealistic by modern educators.  Yet Paulo Blikstein, Assistant Professor of Education at Stanford University wrote in ''Travels in Troy with Freire: Technology as an Agent of Emancipation''&lt;ref name=troy&gt;[http://www.blikstein.com/paulo/documents/books/Blikstein-TravelsInTroyWithFreire.pdf Travels in Troy with Freire: Technology as an Agent of Emancipation]&lt;/ref&gt; that through exploratory building activities, “Not only did students become more autonomous and responsible, they learned to teach one another.”

=== Connectivism ===

[[Yochai Benkler]] explains how the now-ubiquitous computer helps us produce and process knowledge together with others in his book, [[The Wealth of Networks]]. [[George Siemens]] argues in [http://www.elearnspace.org/Articles/connectivism.htm Connectivism: A Learning Theory for the Digital Age], that technology has changed the way we learn, explaining how it tends to complicate or expose the limitations of the learning theories of the past.  In practice, the ideas of connectivism developed in and alongside the then-new social formation, "[[massive open online course]]s" or MOOCs.

[[Connectivism]] proposes that the knowledge we can access by virtue of our connections with others is just as valuable as the information carried inside our minds. The learning process, therefore, is not entirely under an individual’s control—learning can happen outside ourselves, as if we are a member of a large organization where many people are continuously updating a shared database.

Rita Kop and Adrian Hill, in their critique of connectivism,&lt;ref name=connectivism-critique&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; state that:
: it does not seem that connectivism’s contributions to the new paradigm warrant it being treated as a separate learning theory in and of its own right.  Connectivism, however, continues to play an important role in the development and emergence of new pedagogies, where control is shifting from the tutor to an increasingly more autonomous learner.

== Perspectives of other modern theorists ==

In a joint paper, Roy Williams, Regina Karousou, and Jenny Mackness argue that educational institutions should consider "emergent learning," in which learning arises from a self-organized group interaction, as a valuable component of education in the Digital Age.  Web 2.0 puts distributed individuals into a group setting where emergent learning can occur. However, deciding how to manage emergence is important; “fail-safe” management drives activity towards pre-determined outcomes, while “safe/fail experiments” steer away from negative outcomes while leaving space open for mistakes and innovation.&lt;ref name=williams&gt;{{Cite journal

| year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams ''et al.'' also distinguish between the term “environment” as controlled, and “ecology” as free/open.

[[Cathy Davidson]] and [[David Theo Goldberg]] write in ''The Future of Learning Institutions in a Digital Age'' about the potential of “participatory learning,” and a new paradigm of education that is focused on mediated interactions between peers.
They argue that if institutions of higher learning could begin to value this type of learning, instead of simply trying to implement “Instructional Technology” in classrooms, they could transform old models of university education. Davidson and Goldberg introduce “Ten Principles for the Future of Learning,”  which include self-learning, horizontal structures, and open source education.  [[Peter Sloterdijk]]'s recent book "You Must Change Your Life" proposes similar ideas in the context of a "General Disciplinics" that would "counteract the atrophy of the educational system" by focusing on forms of learning that takes place through direct participation in the disciplines.&lt;ref name="Sloterdijk-change"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;156)

[[Yochai Benkler]] &amp; [[Helen Nissenbaum]] discuss implications for the realm of moral philosophy in their 2006 essay, 
"Commons-Based Peer Production and Virtue".&lt;ref name="benkler-and-nissenbaum"&gt;{{Cite journal

Joseph Corneli and Charles Jeffrey Danoff proposed the label “paragogy” to describe a collection of “best practices of effective peer learning.”&lt;ref name=paragogy-paper&gt;Joseph Corneli and Charles Jeffrey Danoff, [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/User:Arided/ParagogyPaper Paragogy: Synergizing individual and organizational learning]&lt;/ref&gt; They published a short book&lt;ref name="paragogy-book"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
along with several papers in which they discuss five "paragogical principles" that form the core of their proposed [[Learning theory (education)#Informal and post-modern theories|learning theory]].  These were generated by rethinking [[Malcolm Knowles]] principles of [[andragogy]] for a learning context that is co-created by the learners.

==Experiments==

The learning theories and approaches described above are currently being tested in peer-learning communities around the world, often adapting [[educational technology]] to support [[informal learning]], though results in formal learning contexts exist too.  For example, [[Eric Mazur]] and colleagues report on "Ten years of experience and results" with a teaching technique they call "[[Peer Instruction]]":

: Peer Instruction engages students during class through activities that require each student to apply the core concepts being presented, and then to explain those concepts to their fellow students.&lt;ref name=mazur&gt;{{Cite journal
| title=Peer instruction: Ten years of experience and results,

| year=2001
| doi=10.1119/1.1374249
| citeseerx=10.1.1.113.6060
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach made early use of a variant of the technique that is now known as the "[[flipped classroom]]":

: To free up class time for ConcepTests, and to prepare students better to apply the material during class, students are required to complete the reading on the topics to be covered before class.

[[P2PU|Peer 2 Peer University]], or P2PU, which was founded in 2009 by Philipp Schmidt and others, is an example from the informal learning side.  Speaking about the beginnings of P2PU, Schmidt echoes Siemens’ connectivism ideas and explains that, “The expertise is in the group. That’s the message, that everyone can bring something to the conversation.”&lt;ref name=dml-schmidt /&gt;  In numerous public talks, Schmidt argues that current educational models are "broken" (particularly on the basis of the high cost of university-level training).   He suggests that social assessment mechanisms similar to those applied in open-source software development can be applied to education.&lt;ref name="jps"&gt;{{Cite journal

Jeff Young’s article in the Chronicle of Higher Education, "When Professors Print Their Own Diplomas",&lt;ref name=young&gt;Jeff Young, Chronicle of Higher Education, [http://chronicle.com/article/When-Professors-Print-Their/1185/ When Professors Print Their Own Diplomas]&lt;/ref&gt; sparked a conversation about the necessity of formal degrees in an age when class lectures can be uploaded for free. The MIT Open Teaching initiative, for example, has since 2001 put all of its course materials online.  But [[David A. Wiley]], then Psychology Professor at Utah State, went further, signing certificates for whoever takes his class.  A similar practice has become even more visible in learning projects like [[Udacity]], [[Coursera]], and [[EdX]].  Although these projects attempt to "scale education" by distributing learning materials produced by experts (not classic examples of peer learning), they do frequently feature peer-to-peer discussions in forums or offline.&lt;ref name=anya&gt;Anya Kamenetz, [http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/events/luncheon/2012/06/kamenetz Who can Learn Online, And How?]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications in development ==

In the forward to a book on the ''Power of peer learning'' by Jean-H. Guilmette, Maureen O'Neil, then president of Canada's International Development Research Centre, states that
: Our experience has proven that [peer learning] is an efficient way to transmit knowledge across a wide range of groups or regions. Peer learning, based on jointly generated evidence, is also an effective means to build capacity and foster scientific excellence. The body of knowledge it generates is a powerful tool for the development of evidence-based policy.&lt;ref name=power-peer&gt;{{Cite book
| last = Guilmette
| first = J-H.
| title = Power of peer learning : networks and development cooperation
| publisher = IDRC, Ottawa, ON, CA
| url = http://hdl.handle.net/10625/28624
| year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guilmette suggests that peer learning is useful in the development context because
:It is my view that managing networks, especially those that are made up of sovereign nations, is fundamentally different from managing companies, organizations, or ministries that fall under a single authority. In essence, the dominant management approach for companies and institutions rests on cybernetics, with the view of keeping communications and accountability simple and clear. Managing methods that are successful in such a context [are] counterproductive when managing networks.

Guilmette cites Anne K. Bernard, who in a report based on extensive interviews, concludes:

: Effective networks act not simply on the basis of optimizing within constraints by attempting to force-fit predicted, linear and regulated programmes of work onto dynamic policy and client communities. Rather, they hone capacities and create mechanisms for the regular feedback and reflected analyses which are needed to deal with the ambiguity of these environments, and to adapt interactively with them.&lt;ref name=bernard&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==

[[Marlene Scardamalia|Scardamalia]] and [[Carl Bereiter|Bereiter]] explain in "Computer Support for Knowledge-Building Communities"&lt;ref name=s-and-b&gt;Scardamalia and Bereiter, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1466822 Computer Support for Knowledge-Building Communities]&lt;/ref&gt; that computers in the classroom have the opportunity to restructure the learning environment, but too often they are simply used to provide a digital version of a normal lesson or exam. They propose that classrooms be exchanged for “[[Knowledge building|knowledge-building communities]]” where students can use computers to connect to and create knowledge in the outside world.  However, as illustrated in citations above, this way of thinking about learning is often at odds with traditional educational praxis.

In "The Role of the Learning Platform in Student-Centered E-Learning", Kurliha, Miettinen, Nokelainen, and Tirri found a "difference in
learning outcomes based on the tools used."&lt;ref name=k-and-m&gt;J. Kurhila, M. Miettinen, P. Nokelainen, and H. Tirri, [http://cosco.hiit.fi/Articles/hiit-2004-10.pdf The Role of the Learning Platform in Student-Centered E-Learning]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the variables at work are not well understood, and are the subject of ongoing research.&lt;ref name=alpine-retreat&gt;Call for participation: Workshop at the Alpine Rendez-Vous 2013 January, 28 - February, 1st 2013 [http://engaged.hnlc.org/story_comments/list/18 It's About Time: Addressing the Many Challenges of Analyzing Multi-Scale Temporal Data]&lt;/ref&gt;   Within a formal education setting, a 1994 study found that students were more responsive to feedback from a teacher than they were to [[Peer feedback#Limitations|peer feedback]].  However, another later study showed that training in assessment techniques had a positive impact on individual student performance.

A classic study&lt;ref name=garbarino&gt;{{cite journal

| doi=10.1037/h0077087}}&lt;/ref&gt; on motivation in [[peer tutor]]ing showed that "reward is no motivator."  Although other more recent work has shown that non-monetary rewards or acknowledgement can make a difference in ''performance'' (for certain populations of peer producers),&lt;ref name=barnstar&gt;{{cite journal
| title=Experimental Study of Informal Rewards in Peer Production

| doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0034358
| pmid=22479610
| pmc=3315525
}}&lt;/ref&gt; the exact motivations for going out of the way to teach or tutor someone else are not clearly understood. As mentioned [[Peer Learning#Connections with Constructivism|above]], learning is often just part of solving a problem, so "peer learning" and "peer teaching" would tend to happen informally when people solve problems in groups.

==Peer learning in practice==
===Research on peer learning===

Research on peer learning may involve [[participant observation]], and may itself be [[Commons-Based Peer Production|peer produced]].  Some of this research falls under the broader umbrella of [[Scholarship of Teaching and Learning]].  [[Computer-supported collaborative learning]] is one obvious context in which to study peer learning, since in such settings "learning is observably and accountably embedded in collaborative activity."&lt;ref name=koschmann&gt;{{Cite journal
| last=Koschmann
| first=T.
| year=2001
| title=Revising the paradigms of instructional technology
| journal=Meeting at the Crossroads: 8th Annual Conference of the Australasian Society for Computers in Learning in Tertiary Education (ASCILITE)}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, peer learning can play a role in settings where traditional conceptions of both "teaching" and "learning" do not apply, for instance, in [[peer review|academic peer review]], in [[organizational learning]], in development work, and in public health programmes.  Research in these areas may fall within the area of [[organizational studies|organization science]], [[science, technology and society]] (STS) or other fields.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11559">A '''certified peer support specialist''', also known as a '''certified peer specialist''', is a person with significant life-altering experience. This is also referred to as "[[lived experience]]". These specialists support individuals with struggles pertaining to [[mental health]], psychological trauma or substance use. Because of their lived experience, such persons have expertise that professional training cannot replicate.&lt;ref name=Mich&gt;{{cite report |publisher=Michigan Department of Community Health |url=http://www.michigan.gov/documents/mdch/MSA-07-52-PIHP_Bulletin_207606_7.pdf |title=Bulletin MSA 07-52: Revisions to Mental Health and Substance Abuse Chapter |date=September 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not to be confused with [[Peer mentoring|peer educators]], who may not consider recovery a suitable goal for everyone and may focus instead on the principles of harm reduction.

Tasks performed by [[peer support]] specialists may include assisting their peers in articulating their goals for recovery, learning and practicing new skills, helping them monitor their progress, supporting them in their treatment, modeling effective [[coping skills|coping techniques]] and [[self-help]] strategies based on the specialist's own recovery experience, and supporting them in [[self-advocacy|advocating]] for themselves to obtain effective services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gacps.org/JobDescription.html |title=Certified Peer Specialist Job Description |website=[[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] Peer Specialist Certification Project |date=March 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2012|9|post=,}} 36 states of the US had established programs that train and certify individuals with lived experience who have initiated their recovery and are willing to support others in their recovery process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utexas.edu/ssw/cswr/institutes/mental-health/ |last1=Kaufman |first1=L. |last2=Brooks |first2=W. |last3=Steinley-Bumgarner |first3=M. |last4=Stevens-Manser |first4=S. |date=2012 |title=Peer Specialist Training and Certification Programs: A National Overview |publisher=University of Texas at Austin |website=Center for Social Work Research. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peer recovery support specialist==
A peer recovery support specialist (P-RSS) is an [[Dictionary of Occupational Titles|occupational title]] of trained individuals who engage with peers in a [[Community mental health service|community-based recovery center]], or outside it around any number of activities, or over the telephone. The peer support specialist can work with individuals as they develop and implement a [[Recovery coaching|personal recovery plan]], which can also serve as a contract for engagement.

The [[Veterans Administration]] has increased its number of peer specialists to 800 {{As of|2013|alt=as of the end of 2013|post=.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=2487 |title=VA Meets President's Mental Health Executive Order Hiring Goal |date=November 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The VA uses peer support specialists much like local, state, and private agencies.

===Recovery planning===
Recovery plans can take many forms. A key component of the [[Recovery approach|recovery management]] model is a personal recovery plan which is drawn up by the individual looking for support, and reviewed with an RSS. This plan is instrumental for individuals in the process of their recovery.

Central to such plans are the overall health and well-being of each individual, not just their mental health. Components often include [[support group]]s and individual therapy, basic health care maintenance, stable housing, improvements in family life and personal relationships, and community connections. The plan may also include education goals, vocational development and employment. Some plans outline a timetable for monitoring, and/or a plan for re-engagement when needed to balance the health and overall quality of life of each individual. 

Peer recovery support specialists can be found in an increasing variety of settings, including [[Community mental health service|community-based recovery centers]]. Funding for peer recovery programs comes from a combination of federal and state agencies as well as local and national charities and grant programs, such as [[Catholic Charities]] and the [[United Way of America|United Way]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |first=Melissa |last=Killeen |title=The Emerging Field of Recovery Coaching |date=March 2009 |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]] |location=Philadelphia, PA |type=Masters }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Training and certification===
When peer support specialists work in publicly funded services, they are required to meet government and state certification requirements. Since the adaptation of the Recovery Management Model by state and federal agencies, peer support specialist courses have been offered by numerous state, nonprofit and for-profit entities such as Connecticut Community for Addiction Recovery,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccar.us&lt;/ref&gt; PRO-ACT (Pennsylvania Recovery Organization-Achieving Community Together),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.councilsepa.org/programs/pro-act&lt;/ref&gt; The McShin Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;http://mcshinfoundation.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/Recovery%20Coach%20Manual%20-%207-22-2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Tennessee Certified Peer Recovery Specialist Training and Program,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tn.gov/mental/recovery/oca3.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Appalachian Consulting Group,&lt;ref&gt;http://acgpeersupport.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and the State of New York's Office of Addiction Services.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oasas.ny.gov/recovery/coach/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; [[PARfessionals]] has developed the first internationally approved online training program for peer support specialists in the fields of mental health and addiction recovery. In addition, numerous for-profit firms offer peer support specialist training. Training includes courses on the ethics of a recovery coach, recovery coaching core competencies, clinical theories as stages of change, [[motivational interviewing]], and [[co-occurring disorders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Killeen |first=Melissa |date=2013 |title=Recovery Coaching: A Guide to Coaching People in Recovery from Addictions |publisher=Create Space Press |location=Charlotte, NC |page=103 }} {{isbn missing|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Outreach worker: Identifies and engages hard-to-reach individuals; offers living proof of the transformative power of recovery and makes recovery attractive.
* [[Motivation|Motivator]]: Exhibits faith in client's capacity for change, encourages and celebrates their recovery achievements, and mobilizes internal and external recovery.
* Resources: Encourages the client's self-advocacy and economic self-sufficiency.
* Ally and confidant: Genuinely cares and listens to the client, can be trusted with confidences, and can identify areas of potential growth.
* Truth-teller: Provides feedback on the recovery progress. Identifies areas which have presented or may present roadblocks to continued abstinence.
* Role model and mentor: Offers their life as living proof of the transformative power of recovery and provides stage-appropriate recovery education.
* Planner: Facilitates the transition from a professionally directed treatment plan to a client-developed and directed personal recovery plan. Assists in structuring daily activities around this plan.
* Problem solver: Helps resolve personal and environmental obstacles to recovery.
* Resource broker: Is knowledgeable of information, for individuals or for their families, about sources of sober housing, recovery conducive employment, health and social services,and  recovery support. Matches the individuals with particular support groups or twelve-step meetings.
* Monitor or companion: When the client will be best served with regular, around the clock attendance, or attendance for a set number of hours per day, the client may need a sober companion. This companion can be available for travel in and out of the country. The sober companion processes each client’s response to professional services and mutual aid exposures to enhance engagement, reduce attrition, and resolve problems in the relationship. The companion provides early re-intervention and recovery re-initiation services.
* Tour guide: Introduces newcomers into the culture of recovery; provides an orientation to recovery roles, rules, rituals, language, etiquette; and opens doors for opportunities for community participation.
* Advocate: Provides an invaluable service for those resistant to remaining abstinent from drugs and/or alcohol, but who must do so due to legal, medical, family or contractual obligations. Helps the individual's families navigate complex social, service and legal systems.
* Educator: Provides a client with normative information about the stages of recovery. They can facilitate the process necessary to remain free from the addiction, inform client of the professional helpers within the community and about the prevalence, pathways, and lifestyles of long-term recovery.
* Community organizer: Every member of the community support center helps develop and expand recovery support resources, enhances cooperative relationships between professional service organizations and local recovery support groups, cultivates opportunities for people in recovery to participate in volunteerism, and performs other acts of service to the community.
* [[Lifestyle consultant]]/coach: Supports the client through challenges arising from everyday activities. For some, this is done through several one-on-one sessions each week, while some clients prefer daily telephone contact. Assists individuals and their families to develop sobriety-based rituals of daily living; and encourages activities across religious, spiritual, and secular frameworks that enhance life's meaning and purpose.
* Friend: Provides sober companionship; a social bridge from the culture of addiction and mental illness to the culture of recovery.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2209">Postbaccalaureate programs (postbac) are reserved for students who are working toward a second bachelor's degree or a [[second entry degree]]. These programs are offered for those who already have a first [[undergraduate degree]].&lt;ref&gt;https://admit.washington.edu/apply/postbaccalaureate&lt;/ref&gt; Post Baccalaureate programs are not considered traditional [[postgraduate education|graduate education]], but it is more advanced than a bachelor's degree.&lt;ref&gt;http://business.athabascau.ca/mba/post-baccalaureate-diploma-management/&lt;/ref&gt; These programs are offered under the umbrella of [[continuing education]] and leads to a second graduate degree. Often first year of the [[second entry degree]] is redacted with Postbaccalaureate [[Credential#Academic credentials|credentials]] (PBD). Programs like post-degree diploma,&lt;ref&gt;http://postdegree.uwo.ca/&lt;/ref&gt; [[graduate diploma]], [[Graduate Certificate|graduate certificates]] or a [[pre-medical]] to a '''master's degree''' in a field such as [[healthcare science|biomedical or health sciences]] may come under the range of '''post-baccalaureate''' programs. In addition, students with a bachelor's degree, who wish to pursue a master's degree in a field other than their BS/BA degree, may be admitted to a college or university individualized or preset postbac program to earn the necessary entry credits in their new chosen subject. These courses of study are considered as an equivalent blend of foundation year [[graduate school|graduate]]/[[professional school]] studies and final year of the specific bachelor's program. This also provides opportunity to those who prepare for changing careers and profession or as a supportive for those interested in continuing education to familiarize with new modalities in their particular fields. The usual length of the programs is 8 months to 1 year and the advanced thesis route grad-entry program is for 2 years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4858">The '''QED manifesto''' was a proposal for a computer-based database of all [[mathematics|mathematical]] knowledge, strictly formalized and with all proofs having been [[automated proof checking|checked automatically]]. ([[Q.E.D.]] means {{lang|la|quod erat demonstrandum}} in [[Latin]], meaning "which was to be demonstrated.") 

==Overview==
The idea for the project arose in 1993, mainly under the impetus of [[Robert S. Boyer|Robert Boyer]]. The goals of the project, tentatively named ''QED project'' or ''project QED'', were outlined in the QED manifesto, a document first published in 1994, with input from several researchers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.chalmers.se/Cs/Research/Logic/TypesSS05/Extra/wiedijk_2.pdf The QED Manifesto] in ''Automated Deduction - CADE 12'', Springer-Verlag, Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence, Vol. 814, pp. 238-251, 1994. [http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/qed/qed.html HTML version]&lt;/ref&gt; Explicit authorship was deliberately avoided. A dedicated mailing list was created, and two scientific conferences on QED took place, the first one in 1994 at [[Argonne National Laboratories]] and the second in 1995 in [[Warsaw]] organized by the [[Mizar system|Mizar]] group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mizar.org/people/romat/qed95rep.pdf The QED Workshop II report]&lt;/ref&gt;

The project seems to have died in 1996, never having produced more than discussions and plans. In a 2007 paper, Freek Wiedijk identifies two reasons for the failure of the project.&lt;ref&gt;Freek Wiedijk, [http://mizar.org/trybulec65/8.pdf The QED Manifesto Revisited], 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In order of importance:
* Very few people are working on formalization of mathematics. There is no compelling application for fully mechanized mathematics.
* [[Formalized mathematics]] does not yet resemble real, traditional mathematics. This is partly due to the complexity of mathematical notation, and partly to the limitations of existing [[Automated theorem prover|theorem provers]] and [[proof assistant]]s; the paper finds that the major contenders, [[Mizar system|Mizar]], [[HOL theorem prover family|HOL]], and [[Coq]], have serious shortcomings in their abilities to express mathematics.

Nonetheless, QED-style projects are regularly proposed, and the [[Mizar system|Mizar]] library has successfully formalized a large portion of undergraduate mathematics. {{As of|2007}} it is the largest such library.&lt;ref&gt;Fairouz Kamareddine, Manuel Maarek, Krzysztof Retel, and J. B. Wells, ''[http://mizar.org/trybulec65/7.pdf Gradual Computerisation/Formalisation of Mathematical Texts into Mizar]''&lt;/ref&gt; Another such project is the [[Metamath]] proof database.

In 2014 the Twenty years of the QED Manifesto&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.ru.nl/qed20/QED-index.html Twenty years of the QED Manifesto workshop]&lt;/ref&gt; workshop was organized as part of the [[Vienna Summer of Logic]].

People can acquire knowledge by distance learning tools, for instance, [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Khan Academy]] and so on. Social learning tools may mediate in [[Formal learning|formal]] or [[informal learning]] environments to help create connections between [[learner]]s, [[Teacher|instructor]]s and [[information]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; These connections form dynamic knowledge networks.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Social learning tools are used in schools for teaching/learning and in businesses for training. Within a school environment, the use of social learning tools can affect not only the user (student) but his/her caretaker as well as his/her instructor. It brings a different approach to the traditional way of learning which affects the student and his/her support circle. Companies also use social learning tools. They used them to improve knowledge transfer within departments and across teams. Businesses use a variety of these tools to create a social learning environment.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; They are also used in company settings to help improve team work, problem solving, and performance in stressful situations.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eduakcja.eu/index.php/en/archives/nr-1-3-2012/40-archiwum/no-1-3-2012/159-social-learning-tools-usage-in-polsh-enterprises.html|title=Social Learning Tools Usage in Polsh Enterprises|last=Żołędziewski|first=Łukasz|date=|website=eduakcja.eu|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social learning tools are used for people who are willing to share their good ideas/thoughts with someone else. The ideas can be related to either the academic studies or any other daily skills that we want to share with others. Social learning tools connect learning to our daily lives. It creates a learning environment more truthful to today's society. There are a couple of common elements that should be present in a social learning tool. Technology should be involved to allow physical and cognitive learning. There should be interactions between the people who use the tool and interactions with the software. Another element is trust. Users should trust the software and what other people have created.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baborska-Narozny|first=Magdalena|last2=Stevenson|first2=Fionn|last3=Chatterton|first3=Paul|title=A Social Learning Tool – Barriers and Opportunities for Collective Occupant Learning in Low Carbon Housing|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2014.12.411|journal=Energy Procedia|volume=62|pages=492–501|doi=10.1016/j.egypro.2014.12.411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frequently Used Social Learning Tools==

=== Blogger ===
[[File:Blogger logo.svg|thumb|Blogger logo]]
[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]] is a site in which users can create their own blog. Blogger can be used in an educational context. A teacher could create a blog in which students could interact on. This would allow students to improve their writing and planning skills. Students would have to think about how they would write out their information on the blog in order to convey their message properly. Blogger provides opportunities for students to share what they wrote with their peers and with their caretakers. The blogs could also be a form of electronic portfolios that could show what the students created during the school year. Blogger has settings in which only people with permission can see or write on the blogs themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bestmastersineducation.com/social-media/|title=The Use of Social Media in School|work=Best Masters in Education|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Facebook===
[[File:Facebook Logo Mini.svg|thumb|123x123px|Facebook logo]]
[[Facebook]] is an online communication tool that allows individuals to interact with each other within a virtual community. It has become the most popular social networking site since its beginnings in 2004. Facebook was co-founded in 2004 by [[Mark Zuckerberg]] with his roommates and colleagues from [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/mark-zuckerberg-507402|title=Mark Zuckerberg|last=|first=|date=|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zuckerberg is presently the [[CEO]] of Facebook.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This online communication tool can be used for personal and for professional purposes. Technology plays an integral part of students' daily lives and teachers will need to find ways of implementing these technologies into their classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mike|first=Fewkes, Aaron M.{{!}}McCabe,|date=2012-01-01|title=Facebook: Learning Tool or Distraction?.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ972449|journal=Journal of Digital Learning in Teacher Education|language=en|volume=28|issue=3|pages=|issn=2153-2974|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research is currently being conducted on the benefits of implementing Facebook in educational settings and how it could potentially be used as a tool for teaching and learning, even if it is known for social networking in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hassan|first=Isham Shah|date=2014-04-03|title=FACEBOOK AS A TOOL FOR TEACHING AND LEARNING|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282251534_FACEBOOK_AS_A_TOOL_FOR_TEACHING_AND_LEARNING?enrichId=rgreq-1a616d2726eef902345ecfdc11da92fc-XXX&amp;enrichSource=Y292ZXJQYWdlOzI4MjI1MTUzNDtBUzoyNzg3MDk3OTkwMTQ0MDZAMTQ0MzQ2MTAwMjY2MA==&amp;el=1_x_2&amp;_esc=publicationCoverPdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Facebook can be used to create discussion groups for group projects to divide the work and stay up to date with each other. It can also be used to share articles. Educators can also create professional Facebook accounts for their classrooms, which could be potentially used as a dashboard to upload course material and assignments. It can also be used to create polls to get some feedback and suggestions on the course that the teacher would like to implement. The objective is to improve the methods of teaching as well as the learning experience of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://elearningindustry.com/how-to-use-facebook-for-social-learning|title=How To Use Facebook For Social Learning|last=Pappas|first=Christopher|date=2013-05-17|work=eLearning Industry|access-date=2018-03-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the use of technologies, students are more engaged in their learning.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Google Hangouts ===
[[File:Hangouts Icon.png|thumb|103x103px|Google Hangouts logo]][[File:Instagram logo 2016.svg|thumb|100x100px|Instagram logo]][[Google Hangouts]] is a [[Communication software|communication software platform]] that was created by [[Google]]. Some features of this social learning tool include starting a chat conversation or video call, phone calls through WI-FI or data and sending messages. All you need is a Google Account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/hangouts/answer/2944865?co=GENIE.Platform=Desktop&amp;hl=en|title=Get started with Hangouts - Computer - Hangouts Help|website=support.google.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google Hangouts has become an increasingly popular tool to participate and communicate with people around the world. It can be seen as a better version of [[Skype]] in the sense that it has the potential to record or have a group chat without the occasional availability issues that may be seen in the free version of Skype.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.emergingedtech.com/2014/05/20-excellent-free-tools-for-interactive-collaboration-experiences-in-the-classroom/|title=20 Fun Free Tools for Interactive Classroom Collaboration {{!}} Emerging Education Technologies|last=Walsh|first=Kelly|website=www.emergingedtech.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it easily accessible and efficient in many ways. There are also many other useful tools from Google like [[Google Drive]] that allow users to take part in editing and sharing different content, assignments ,and sources even when not together. It only takes an Internet connection and everything is saved in your own personal drive.

=== Instagram ===
[[Instagram]], founded in 2010, is a [[social networking app]] that was created for sharing photos and videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-instagram-3486316|title=Everyone's Using This App Called Instagram...

[[Khan Academy]], founded in 2006 by [[Sal Khan|Salman “Sal” Khan]], is a non-profit organization providing free online educational resources used by millions of people worldwide.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.edweek.org/media/2014-03-07_implementation_briefing.pdf|title=Research on the Use of Khan Academy in Schools|last=SRI Education|first=|date=2014-03-01|website=Education Week|access-date=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is best known for its strong mathematics content provided through video tutorials.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/30030/khan-academy-offers-trainings|title=Khan Academy Trains Teachers to Use Its Videos and Tools|last=|first=|date=2013-07-18|work=KQED|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mathematics content is designed to help students from kindergarten to grade 12.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In 2009, Khan Academy began expanding its educational learning platform to include other subjects, including art history and computer science.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The mathematics section is also much more accessible since its recent translation into French. Khan Academy has also diverged to offering other means of learning beyond the online videos, including self-paced training exercises, quizzes, and dashboards for teachers to keep track of student progress.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.profweb.ca/en/publications/articles/keeping-track-of-students-learning-using-khan-academy|title=Keeping Track of Students’ Learning Using Khan Academy {{!}} Articles {{!}} Publications|last=APOP|first=|date=2015-05-19|website=Profweb|language=en|access-date=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the coach resource section which provides guidelines to parents or teachers for example, who want to learn how to use Khan Academy.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Khan Academy is used in majority by individuals outside of school for study purposes. However, in recent years, its use in educational settings has been increasing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Some teachers have implemented the use of Khan Academy in their classrooms, believing it would simply be an adjunct to their instruction. However, it became more important than this. Some teachers are now thinking of “flipping” the normal functioning of classroom settings and including video tutorials from Khan Academy in their teaching.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/07/ff_khan/|title=How Khan Academy Is Changing the Rules of Education|last=Thompson|first=Clive|date=2011-07-15|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-03-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is to have students watch the videos or read the lectures provided by the teacher at home and to do the problem sets during class time. It has been shown that students are having the most difficulty when they are doing their homework.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;[[File:Pinterest-logo.png|thumb|99x99px|Pinterest logo]]

=== Pinterest ===
[[Pinterest]] is a web-based [[Software Platform|software platform]] that allows its users to share and discover new information through the use of pictures, descriptions, and short videos. It can also be seen as an online pin board where users can post on their board, collect from other boards, and privately share posted pins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-pinterest-3486578|title=Everything You Need to Know to Start Using Pinterest|work=Lifewire|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be useful in the classroom through having students post their works on their own board or a class board and to share (re-pin) information between their peers. It is easily accessible and is popular for its application that can be used on any mobile or smart device.

=== Skype ===
[[File:Skype logo (fully transparent).svg|thumb|149x149px|Skype logo]][[Skype]] is a free telecommunications tool that gives its users the opportunity to voice chat or video call between various devices such as laptops and cellphones. Although this application requires the Internet, it has grown to be one of the world's most popular communication tools. Skype is an excellent resource to use when collaborating with participants who are in remote areas because discussions and communication can still occur. Skype can be applied to classrooms in many ways. For example, it can be used as a way to include students who are at home due to illness into collaborative discussions held in class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.emergingedtech.com/2014/05/20-excellent-free-tools-for-interactive-collaboration-experiences-in-the-classroom/|title=20 Fun Free Tools for Interactive Classroom Collaboration {{!}} Emerging Education Technologies|last=Walsh|first=Kelly|website=www.emergingedtech.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twitter===
[[File:Twitter logo.svg|thumb|237x237px|Twitter logo]]
[[Twitter]] is an established micro-blogging service available to individuals with Internet access world-wide and provides unlimited access to social networks for its users, to send and receive messages. In 2006, it was funded by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams. One of the common site users is media outlets to broadcast current news updates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-twitter-was-founded-2011-4|title=The Real History Of Twitter|last=Carlson|first=Nicholas|date=2011-04-13|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, people use Twitter as a daily source of  information to inform themselves on local and world news. Another way that Twitter is utilized, is in the classroom, when a teacher builds a classroom account which can be viewed by their students. This account would allow teachers to post reminders for test revisions, assignment due dates, upcoming field trips and conferences, and review post lessons and answer homework questions. For future lesson plans, teachers could have students tweet what they learned from the previous class and reflect on the content and then engage in classroom discussions on Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bestmastersineducation.com/social-media/|title=The Use of Social Media in School|work=Best Masters in Education|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== YouTube ===
[[File:Logo of YouTube (2005-2011).svg|thumb|YouTube logo]]
[[YouTube]] is a video-sharing website founded in 2005 that was created for users to share, like, upload, and comment on videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.webwise.ie/parents/what-is-youtube/|title=Explained: What is YouTube?|date=2015-10-10|work=Webwise.ie|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, YouTube can be used on many devices through applications like its [[YouTube App|YouTube app]]. Although it is mainly used for music, videos on reviewing items or how to do something, it may also be used for educational purposes. There are many accounts just for specific educational subjects like [[Crash Course (YouTube)|Crash Course]], an account that focuses on subjects like anatomy, biology, chemistry and physics. YouTube can be a great social learning tool in education in many different ways: showing videos on different subjects in class or having students research how something works to answer questions, for homework or even to seek further knowledge. There are many platforms of YouTube that lead to other useful social learning tools for educational purposes. [[TED Talks]] created its account on YouTube, which provides videos of the best ideas from trusted voices discussing different issues, sharing knowledge or facts and opinions, sharing poetry and spoken word.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAuUUnT6oDeKwE6v1NGQxug|title=TED|website=YouTube|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; For education, TED has created its own platform called [[TED-Ed]], which is essentially short TED Talks videos that may be used for information or insight purposes on many different school subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.opencolleges.edu.au/informed/features/social-media-tools-for-education/|title=25 Awesome Social Media Tools for Education - InformED|date=2013-11-15|work=InformED|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is even such thing as [[TeacherTube]], which is another type of social learning tool similar to YouTube though initially created for education teachers. It may be used for teachers, students or parents through the use of published educational videos with a library of different content filled with videos, audio and pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.edudemic.com/youtube-in-classroom/|title=The Teacher’s Guide to Using YouTube in the Classroom {{!}} Edudemic|website=www.edudemic.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Environments==

The different environments in which social learning tools can be used may influence the connections between learners, educators and the knowledge or information being acquired. These environments can be formal, non-formal, informal or virtual.
*'''[[Formal learning]]''', is the planned process of acquiring knowledge that happens within a structured educational or institute setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/strengthening-education-systems/quality-framework/core-resources/learning-environment/|title=Learning Environment {{!}} Education {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lecturers in the university setting may use [[Moodle]] to post class lectures and the latest information to students, e.g. courseware used during lectures, coursework, quizzes, and forums. Students can both prepare and review for lectures based on what professors have posted at any given time.
*[[Nonformal learning|'''Non-formal learning''']], is the planned process learning that is voluntary and not in a structured environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pjp-eu.coe.int/en/web/youth-partnership/non-formal-learning|title=Non-formal learning / education|website=youth partnership|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of planned learning that is not directly associated with school or the education system is done in a non-formal learning environment. For example, taking swimming lessons at the town pool. The swimming lessons take place in an unstructured environment though are planned, organized, and taught by an instructor of prior knowledge on the subject. Social learning tools can be used in this particular environment to facilitate learning like showing a video on [[YouTube]] on how to swim.
*'''[[Informal learning]]''', is when information is gained inadvertently or unstructured, which usually happens on a day-to-day basis. Informal learning happens outside of the formal classroom during conversations among people, through exploration and personal experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fctl.ucf.edu/teachingandlearningresources/learningenvironments/informal.php|title=Learning Environments: Informal Learning Settings - UCF Faculty Center for Teaching and Learning|website=www.fctl.ucf.edu|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many circumstances can be considered to be part of an informal learning environment, e.g. the casual watching of videos on [[Instagram]], [[Facebook]] or [[YouTube]] feed.
*[[Virtual learning environment|'''Virtual learning''']], is when learning is done via the use of web-based platforms in and out of school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://global.oup.com/uk/orc/learnvle/|title=Oxford University Press {{!}} Online Resource Centre {{!}} Learn about Virtual Learning Environment/Course Management System content|last=GOODALL|first=Fiona|website=global.oup.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This learning environment is almost always used for any social learning tool. The virtual learning environment (VLE) encourages students to explore, discover and exchange information quickly, creatively and independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/4365517bede69a6ce72f100e145c7562/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=33585|title=Why use a virtual learning environment? - ProQuest|website=search.proquest.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many social learning tools created for the sole purpose of education. The education system has adopted technology as a way to educate students in school and outside of school settings, where students have shown to work well in the VLE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edtechnology.co.uk/Article/a-guide-to-successfully-adopting-technology-based-learning-elliot-gowans-vp-at-d2l|title=A guide to successfully adopting technology-based learning|work=Education Technology|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social learning tools including [[Moodle]], [[Khan Academy]], [[TED-Ed]] and [[TeacherTube]] can all be used both in school and at home through the use of the [[Internet]]. This goes to show that social learning tools can be both used within all learning environments while being used for educational purposes. However, it is important for these social learning tools to first be introduced in the formal learning environment, e.g. in the classroom, in order to be established as first an educational tool and second a [[social media platform]] that may be accessible outside of school.

The majority of informal learning environments are directly related to the use of social media, e.g. [[Facebook]], [[Instagram]], [[Twitter]], [[Television channels|Television Channels]] and so on. For instance, there are many Food TV or [[YouTube]] Channels that allow people to self-teach themselves how to cook. This is done through the informal and VLE where a person can simply learn from the comfort of their own home and according to their own pace. Not only does [[social software]] or [[Media (communication)|media]] allow society to gain new knowledge or information; it is easily accessible and can even happen without the desire or intent of learning.

== Effectiveness: Education and Business ==
* The student/employee learning experience is expanded and advanced through the usage of technology.

=== Convenience ===
Social learning tools are convenient because through the various platforms that are now available, communication between students and teachers is fluid and the exchange of knowledge and ideas can be achieved remotely. This means that both parties are no longer required to travel in order to attend school and to study content based subjects.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brownson|first=Kenneth|date=2004|title=The Benefits of a Work-at-Home Program|url=https://ovidsp-tx-ovid-com.proxy3.library.mcgill.ca/sp-3.28.0a/ovidweb.cgi?WebLinkFrameset=1&amp;S=OBMKFPOHMNDDJEBBNCFKDDOBFKGAAA00&amp;returnUrl=ovidweb.cgi%3f%26Full%2bText%3dL%257cS.sh.22.23%257c0%257c00126450-200404000-00007%26S%3dOBMKFPOHMNDDJEBBNCFKDDOBFKGAAA00&amp;directlink=https%3a%2f%2fovidsp.tx.ovid.com%2fovftpdfs%2fFPDDNCOBDDBBMN00%2ffs046%2fovft%2flive%2fgv025%2f00126450%2f00126450-200404000-00007.pdf&amp;filename=The+Benefits+of+a+Work-at-Home+Program.&amp;pdf_key=FPDDNCOBDDBBMN00&amp;pdf_index=/fs046/ovft/live/gv025/00126450/00126450-200404000-00007|journal=The Health Care Manager|volume=23|pages=141–144|via=Ovid}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students can communicate with their teachers over the Internet and attend and actively participate in lectures. Social learning tools provide both students and teachers with a media platform that enables [[distance education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beldarrain|first=Yoany|title=Distance Education Trends: Integrating new technologies to foster student interaction and collaboration|url=https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy3.library.mcgill.ca/doi/pdf/10.1080/01587910600789498?needAccess=true|journal=Distance Education|volume=27|issue=2|pages=139–153|doi=10.1080/01587910600789498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cost-Efficient ===
Social learning tools give access, as a hub, to sources of information and resources online, either for free or at low costs through the use of the Internet. Most of these tools can easily be downloaded and used on a smartphone, tablet or computer. For example, there are online applications ([[Application software|apps]]) like EasyBib, which generates bibliographic citations in the necessary styles as needed for research, essays and other assignments and does this at no cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Ullen|first=Mary K.|last2=Kessler|first2=Jane|title=Citation apps for mobile devices|url=https://www-emeraldinsight-com.proxy3.library.mcgill.ca/doi/pdfplus/10.1108/RSR-09-2015-0041|journal=Reference Services Review|volume=44|issue=1|pages=48–60|doi=10.1108/rsr-09-2015-0041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== School-Wide Application ===
Social learning tools are applicable to elementary, high school, CEGEP, and university level learning. The social media platforms such as Facebook, Skype or Twitter could enhance the communication and interaction between students and their teachers. For example, teachers could post assignments, schedules, lesson summaries or notices regarding class updates for the students to view. For professional development, it provides teachers with the networking to connect with other professionals, share lesson plans, and receive up to date research regarding how education is taught.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://education.cu-portland.edu/blog/leaders-link/educational-social-media-use/|title=Dos and Don'ts for Using Social Media as a Teacher|date=2014-10-01|work=Concordia University-Portland|access-date=2018-03-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, students could post their questions online for the teacher to answer in the group section, have class discussions and exchange ideas, and incorporate other forms of communication. As well, enable students to find real world applications and associate it with their topic. The platforms mentioned above, allow students to look beyond the classroom for answers to questions and to obtain outside input.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://campustechnology.com/articles/2012/01/19/pros-and-cons-of-social-media-in-the-classroom.aspx|title=Pros and Cons of Social Media in the Classroom -- Campus Technology|website=Campus Technology|language=en|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Learning Tools ===
Social networking permits students to research and gather information on topics beyond the classroom setting. For example, Twitter is one of the social learning tools implemented into classrooms for language learning. Tweets are a method of improving short essays and supports grammatically correct writing and reading skills of a language. It is a form of active learning which further engages the students. After posting a tweet, students would get feedback from other site users and have a second opinion on their writing piece. Another advantage would be to use Twitter in large lecture halls, so students could engage in the topic of discussion and share their interests and thoughts with their colleagues and professors in an ongoing basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamidon, Alias, Siraj, Kokila, Mohammed, Thanabalan|first=Ida, Norlidah, Saedah, K, Mariani, T,|date=2013|title=Potential of Twitter in Post-reading Activities Among Community College Students in Malaysia|url=https://ac.els-cdn.com/S187704281303838X/1-s2.0-S187704281303838X-main.pdf?_tid=e1ec909c-6b71-443e-b51c-97c39361e7a3&amp;acdnat=1521472050_a4b678aa13859aabda8bc5f910569162|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|volume=103|pages=725–734|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Commercial Advantages ===
There are several advantages to the field of commerce, when it comes to implementing social learning tools in the workplace. If businesses create a forum for customers to write their feedbacks, they could have more ideas about how to improve their products, which enables the company to create better marketing strategies. Furthermore, employees could use the Internet or other program systems, in order to work from home. They could be informed about the current issues and concerns of the workplace. It allows people to concentrate without any distractions at the office, it offers the flexibility of scheduling, time engagement and committing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brownson|first=Kenneth|date=2004-04-01|title=The Benefits of a Work-at-home Program|url=https://insights.ovid.com/pubmed?pmid=15192994|journal=The Health Care Manager|language=ENGLISH|volume=23|issue=2|issn=1525-5794}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Employment Opportunities ===
Social media platforms has made searching for job employment and connecting with potential employers more available for students entering the workforce for both part-time and full-time work. For example, Facebook and Twitter can be utilized to follow the companies’ postings and what is going on in the field.

[[LinkedIn]] is a website designed for students or other individuals to create professional profiles, post their curriculum vitae, receive current notifications on available employment and network with companies, businesses, school boards and industries to apply for a wider variety of job offers.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==Drawbacks in a Classroom Setting==
===Inappropriate or Offensive Use===

A major concern among educators regarding social learning tools is the lack of control and monitoring. When students are given access to the Internet, they may post inappropriate content or use these sites in a way that can be disrespectful or damaging to others. Educators do not always have the means to be able to monitor every student's usage of these social learning tools, therefore students may be able to take advantage of this privilege for their own personal benefit and amusement. Posting pornography or using foul language are just a few examples that highlight the offensive and inappropriate behaviour that can be exhibited by students through social learning tools in classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.schooliseasy.com/2014/02/social-media-in-the-classroom/|title=5 pros and cons of social media in the classroom for educational use|date=2014-02-21|work=School is Easy Tutoring|access-date=2018-03-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distraction From Learning===

Social learning tools give students access to the Internet, where they can take advantage of other irrelevant websites and interfaces. It is very easy for students to get distracted by other social platforms that can divert their attention away from information being presented in class.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://campustechnology.com/articles/2012/01/19/pros-and-cons-of-social-media-in-the-classroom.aspx|title=Pros and Cons of Social Media in the Classroom -- Campus Technology|website=Campus Technology|language=en|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ultimately results in a disruption to the student's learning process which is a common concern for the majority of faculty members.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.onlinelearningsurvey.com/reports/social-media-for-teaching-and-learning-2013-report.pdf|title=Social Media for Teaching and Learning|last=Seaman|first=Jeff|publisher=Pearson Learning Solutions|year=2013|isbn=|location=Boston, MA|pages=5–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research has shown that disruption to the learning process can significantly affect a student’s ability to retain information into their long-term memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://education.cu-portland.edu/blog/leaders-link/educational-social-media-use/|title=Dos and Don'ts for Using Social Media as a Teacher|date=2014-10-01|work=Concordia University-Portland|access-date=2018-03-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educators should be made aware of the potential risk for technology to be a distraction and set clear guidelines for their students to follow.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Cyberbullying===

As the use of technology increases, cyberbullying is becoming more prevalent among students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Peter|date=July 2006|title=An Investigation into Cyberbullying, its Forms, Awareness and Impact, and the Relationship Between Age and Gender in Cyberbullying|url=https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/RBX03-06.pdf|journal=Anti-Bullying Alliance|volume=|pages=|via=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130323025443/https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/RBX03-06.pdf|archivedate=2013-03-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although social learning tools give students the ability to interact with teachers and peers, it also provides them with the opportunity to bully others online. This type of malicious behaviour can be seen at every level of education, including college campuses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Educators should plan to intervene on any incidents of cyberbullying that they witness in order to prevent more serious offences. They should also encourage respectful and positive behaviours towards peers when in the classroom and online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Notar|first=Charles|date=2013|title=Cyberbullying: Resources for Intervention and Prevention|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1053892.pdf|journal=Universal Journal of Educational Research|volume=1|pages=133–137|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of Face-to-Face Communication===

There is much speculation about whether or not social learning tools can provide enough opportunity for the development of real-life social skills. Some educators are concerned that students will not fully develop the ability to communicate effectively or command attention if they are constantly learning through a screen. Although social learning tools create opportunities for students to interact with others via web interfaces, it does not offer them authentic real-life interactions where students are forced to express themselves verbally or connect with others face-to-face.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Protection of Students’ Privacy===

Social learning tools such as Facebook and Twitter are online networking websites that are public and can be accessed by anyone. Parents and educators alike have expressed their concerns about students using these platforms, as they could expose students’ identities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Protecting students’ personal privacy should be a top priority for educators, however this can be a challenge when using social learning tools. To prevent these issues from arising, schools should develop a system which ensures that students stay anonymous when posting content online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2017/01/how_to_protect_students_personal_data.html|title=The Best Way to Protect Students’ Personal Data|last=Berdik|first=Chris|date=2017-01-18|work=Slate|access-date=2018-03-15|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stress for Teachers===

Social learning tools give students the ability to communicate efficiently with teachers outside of regular classroom hours. Although this may be a benefit to student learning, excessive stress is placed on teachers to respond quickly and provide feedback. Many faculty members have expressed that technology has harmed their work environment, as digital communication increases their stress levels. Furthermore, they have reported that digital communication has increased the number of hours they work in a day.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Educators can also experience added pressure to learn how to teach with social learning tools. Many teachers are skilled with using technology, however they do not possess the knowledge on how to implement social learning tools in teaching. Educators need to be taught how and when to use technology, so they can effectively implement it within their curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;https://search.proquest.com/docview/195592643&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plagiarism and Student Integrity===

Academic integrity is an important part of learning in all educational settings. Plagiarism is a concern for teachers that can be amplified when students are using social learning tools. The Internet is a database that holds a multitude of resources available to online users. Unfortunately, direct access to all of this information when using social learning tools makes it easy for students to copy the work of others and use it as their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elearningfacultymodules.org/index.php/Academic_Integrity_vs._Dishonesty|title=Academic Integrity vs. Dishonesty - E-Learning Faculty Modules|website=elearningfacultymodules.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost of Equipment===

Social learning tools would not exist without the technological devices that harbor them. In order to implement social learning tools into the classroom, the school or school board must invest a large sum of money in order to purchase technological devices for its students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2017/aug/01/schools-slowly-edtech-sector-cubetto-kahoot-firefly|title=Out with the old school?

Furthermore, personal cell phones are a popular device that can be used as a vehicle for teaching using social learning tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.schoolmoney.org/advantages-using-cell-phones-classroom/|title=Advantages of Using Cell Phones in the Classroom - SchoolMoney.org|date=2017-02-15|work=SchoolMoney.org|access-date=2018-03-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not every student has the money to buy a cell phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.growingwireless.com/get-the-facts/quick-facts|title=Kids Wireless Use Facts|website=www.growingwireless.com|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an educational setting, '''standards-based assessment''' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edglossary.org/standards-based/|title=Standards-Based Definition|last=Partnership|first=Great Schools|date=2014-01-30|work=The Glossary of Education Reform|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;is [[Educational assessment|assessment]] that relies on the evaluation of student understanding with respect to agreed-upon standards, also known as "outcomes". The standards set the criteria for the successful demonstration of the understanding of a concept or skill.&lt;ref name = "unsw"&gt;{{Citation| author = &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |url = https://teaching.unsw.edu.au/standards-based-assessment|title = Standards-Based Assessment|accessdate = February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of standards-based assessment==

In the [[Outcome-based education|standards-based]] paradigm&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eleducation.org/resources/chapter-8-standards-based-grading|title=Leaders of Their Own Learning: Chapter 8: Standards-Based Grading {{!}} EL Education|website=eleducation.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;, students have the freedom to demonstrate understanding in diverse ways, including (but not limited to) selected response (e.g. multiple choice tests), physical constructions, written responses, and performances. Of course, these are not new types of assessments, nor is the concept of [[Differentiated instruction|differentiated assessment]]. The teacher uses all available observations and quantitative information to summarize learning with reference to a specific standard. With these data, a teacher can formulate the steps or actions that can be taken to gain mastery of a particular concept. That is, it aids in [[assessment for learning]].

One of the key aspects of standards-based assessment is post-assessment feedback. The feedback a student receives from this type of assessment does not emphasizes a score, percentage, or statistical average, but information about the expectations of performance as compared to the standard. A standards-based approach does not necessarily dismiss a summative grade, percentage, or a measure of central tendency (such as a mean, or median). However, an assessment that does not reference or give feedback with respect to a standard would not be standards-based. There is a large body of evidence that points to the effectiveness of appropriate feedback.&lt;ref name = "power"&gt;{{Citation|author = [[John Hattie]]|url = http://education.qld.gov.au/staff/development/performance/resources/readings/power-feedback.pdf|title = Power of Feedback|accessdate = February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose of standards-based assessment==

The purpose of standards-based assessment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.k12academics.com/education-assessment-evaluation/standards-based-assessment|title=Standards-based Assessment {{!}} K12 Academics|last=Glavin|first=Chris|date=2014-02-06|website=www.k12academics.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; is to connect evidence of learning to learning outcomes (the standards). When standards are explicit and clear, the learner becomes aware of his/her achievement with reference to the standards, and the teacher may use assessment data to give meaningful feedback to students about this progress. The awareness of one's own learning allows students to point to a specific standard of achievement and so strengthens self-regulation and meta-cognition, two skills generally understood to be effective learning strategies.&lt;ref name = "metacog"&gt;{{Citation|author = Emily R. Lai|url = http://education.qld.gov.au/staff/development/performance/resources/readings/power-feedback.pdf|title = Metacognition: A Literature Review|accessdate = February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Framework of the standards-based approach in assessment==

A common approach to standards-based assessment (SBA) is:

* Identify a key fact or important body of knowledge (e.g. a scientific theory, a mathematical relationship), the essential content and concepts.
{{quotation | Example from the British Columbia Grade 3 Curriculum Package (September 2010):
:"It is expected that students will view and demonstrate comprehension of visual texts (e.g., cartoons, illustrations, diagrams, posters)"&lt;ref name="bcgr3"&gt;{{citation|author=British Columbia Ministry of Education|title=Grade 3 Curriculum Package|url=https://www.bced.gov.bc.ca/irp/curric_grade_packages/gr3curric_req.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Education, British Columbia|accessdate=February 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{quotation | Example from the New Zealand curriculum document ''Mathematics Standards for Years 1-8'', by the end of year 5:
:"In contexts that require them to solve problems or model situations, students will be able to create, continue, and predict further members of sequential patterns with two variables"&lt;ref name="nzmath1to8"&gt;{{citation |author=New Zealand Ministry of Education|title=Mathematics Standards for Years 1-8|url=https://nzcurriculum.tki.org.nz/content/download/3166/47235/file/Maths_Standards_amended_vs3.pdf|website=New Zealand Curriculum Online|publisher=Ministry of Education|accessdate=February 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* Identify the indicators (i.e. evidence) that students will show when the concept or content has been understood.
{{quotation | Respectively to the example from the British Columbia Grade 3 Curriculum Package:
:"describe key messages and images and relevant details in response to questions or activities"&lt;ref name="bcgr3" /&gt;}}
* Choose a collection of assessments that will allow students to demonstrate the indicators.
* Using a scale or rubric, identify the proficiency of the student with respect to the standard. This progress is made accessible to the learner in order to provide meaningful feedback. Any feedback should be able to provide information on how the proficiency can be improved&lt;ref name="power" /&gt;) and the educator needs to be aware of the effects of praise during feedback.&lt;ref name="APAUsingPraise"&gt;{{citation |author=Carol Dwyer|title=Using Praise to Enhance Student Resilience and Learning Outcomes|url=http://www.apa.org/education/k12/using-praise.aspx|website=American Psychological Association|publisher=American Psychological Association|accessdate=March 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Repeat instruction, assessment and feedback until the student achieves a predetermined level of mastery.

==Hallmarks of standards-based assessment==

* Standards (i.e. learning outcomes) need to be visible and understandable by students
* Tasks, activities and assessments should be clear about which standard is being practiced
* [[Formative assessment]] should be used to give feedback to students about their progress towards a standard
* Assessment in general should be well-designed, accurate and high in [[Validity (statistics)|validity]] to be fair and accessible
* [[Exemplar theory|Exemplars]] should be used to give students an understanding of how achievement against a standard is measured
* [[Rubric (academic)|Rubrics]] should be used to assess performances and constructed responses&lt;ref name = "rubrics"&gt;{{Citation|author = Susan M. Brookhart|url =  http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/112001/chapters/What-Are-Rubrics-and-Why-Are-They-Important%C2%A2.aspx|title = How to Create and Use Rubrics for Formative Assessment and Grading|accessdate = February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Selective response (e.g. multiple choice) should be used to assess basic understanding and knowledge (as in [[Bloom's Taxonomy]]) of a specific standard (or the underlying pre-requisite concepts associated with the standard)

==Geographical Distinctions==

===United States===

A '''standards-based test''' is an assessment based on the outcome-based education or performance-based education philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news-bulletin.com/news/58020-01-18-06.html] January 18, 2006 Standards- Based Test draws plan for awareness
Jackie Schlotfeldt News-Bulletin Staff Writer Valencia County News-Bulletin "With the New Mexico Standards Based Assessments just a little over a month away"&lt;/ref&gt;  Assessment is a key part of  the standards reform movement. The first part is to set new, higher standards to be expected of every student. Then the curriculum must be aligned to the new standards. Finally, the student must be assessed if they meet these standards of what every student "must know and be able to do". In the United States, a high school diploma which is given on passing a [[high school graduation examination]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.k12academics.com/standardized-testing/national-achievement-tests/high-school-graduation-examination|title=High School Graduation Examination {{!}} K12 Academics|last=Glavin|first=Chris|date=2014-02-06|website=www.k12academics.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Certificate of Initial Mastery]] is awarded only when these standards are achieved. It is fully expected that every child will become proficient in all areas of academic skills by the end of a period, typically 10 years in the United States, but sometimes longer, after the passing of education reform bill by a state legislature. The United States federal government, under [[No Child Left Behind]] can further require that all schools must demonstrate improvement among all students, even if they are already all over proficient.

====Holistic grading====
Rather than using computers to log responses to multiple choice tests, [[rubrics (education)|rubrics]] for  state assessments such as in North Carolina &lt;ref&gt;AFT - Hot Topics - Standards-Based Reform  North Carolina Focused Holistic Scoring Guide: The Expository Composition Grade 7, [http://www.aft.org/topics/sbr/NC.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; ask scorers to look at the entire paper and make judgments. Scorers are not allowed to count errors, and rubrics do not contain numeric measurements of how many spelling or grammar error constitute a "1" or "2". The Analytical Writing section of the [[Graduate Record Examination|GRE]] test is scored using a six-point holistic scale in half-point increments.&lt;ref&gt;GRE Update - March 2006 The Analytical Writing section of the General Test will continue to be scored using the six-point holistic scale in half-point increments [http://www.ets.org/Media/Newsletters/GRE/2006/0601_scale.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Holistic grading is one of the main reason for disagreement between scorers, but for this reason some tests are scored more than once to check for agreement.

====Advantages of Standards-based Assessment====
* Students are compared to a standard that all can reach, rather than artificially ranked into a [[Grading on a curve|bell curve]] where some students must be called failures, and only a few are allowed to ''succeed''
* Humans, not computers can evaluate the entire value of a response rather than imposing a strict right or wrong that is not open to interpretation
* Free response uses and tests for [[higher order thinking skills|higher order thinking]], which is important in most new [[education standards]].
* Computer scored [[multiple choice]] tests have been shown to have deleterious effects for minorities, unfairly denying opportunities.
* Only a standards-based test is aligned with standards-based education reform, which is based on a belief that all students can succeed, not only a few.
* Passing a 10th grade test and awarding a Certificate of Initial Mastery ensures that all students will graduate with the skills they need to succeed in the world-class economy of the twenty-first century.
* Students will no longer be cheated by passing them on to the next grade without obtaining what every child at the grade level must be able to know and do.
* When all students pass all standards, as is the central belief of [[standards-based education reform]], all students from all demographics will achieve the same  test score, eliminating the mysterious [[achievement gap]] which has previously been shown to occur between all groups on all tests. However, as of 2006, no standards-based assessment has yet achieved this optimistic (critics might call it impossible) goal, though many show rising scores.

====Cons====
Compared to a multiple-choice, [[norm-referenced test]], a standards-based test can be recognized by:

* A cut score is determined for different levels of performance. There are no cut scores for norm-referenced tests. There is no failing score on the [[SAT|SAT test]]. Each college or institution sets their own score standards for admission or awards.
* Different levels of performance are set. Typically these are Above Standard, Meets Standard, Below Standard. These levels a typically set in a benchmarking process, even though such a process does not take into an account whether the test items are even appropriate for the grade level.
* Tests are [[Holistic grading|holistically graded]] against a free-written response, often with pictures, rather than graded correct or incorrect among multiple choices.
* Tests are more expensive to grade because of this, typically $25–30 per test compared to $2–$5, not including the cost of developing the test, typically different every year for every state.
* Tests are more difficult to grade because they are typically graded against a handful with no more than one or two example papers at each scoring level. They cannot be graded by computer
* Tests are less reliable. Agreement may fall between 60 and 80 percent on a 4-point scale and be considered to be accurate.
* Graders do not need teaching credentials, only a bachelor's degree in any field, and are typically paid $8 to $11 per hour for part-time work.
* Failure rates as high as 80 to 95 percent are not only not unusual, they are fully expected and announced as test programs are introduced to the local press. Under traditional graduation criteria, African Americans had achieved national graduation rates within a few points of whites. In 2006, three-quarters of African Americans who failed the [[Washington Assessment of Student Learning|WASL]] were promised by Superintendent [[Terry Bergeson]] that they would not get a diploma if they did not pass retakes of the test in two years, even though she had pledged earlier that "all students" would get a world class diploma.
* Failure rates for minorities and special education students are typically two to four times higher than for majority groups as extended response questions are more difficult to answer than multiple choice
* Content is often difficult even for adults to quickly answer, even at grade levels as low as the fourth grade, especially in mathematics. Professor [[Don Orlich]] called the [[Washington Assessment of Student Learning|WASL]] a "disaster", with math and science tests falling well above the normal development level of students at many grade levels.
* Mathematics has a high proportion of statistics and geometry, and a low content of simple arithmetic.
* Schools are scored as zero for students who do not take the test.
* Passing such a test at the 10th grade level is typically planned as being required for graduating high school.
* Passing such a test, rather than the 50th percentile, is defined as [[Educational stages|grade level]] performance.
* A question with a correct answer may be graded as incorrect if it does not show how the answer as arrived at. A question with an incorrect numerical conclusion may not necessarily be graded as wrong.&lt;ref&gt;1997 WASL math released problems&lt;/ref&gt;
* California's first year of the CLAS test permitted no '4' high math grades, not even in the highest scoring schools, in order to leave room for improvement&lt;ref&gt;testimony of Maureen DiMarco to Washington State legislators&lt;/ref&gt;
* The North Carolina Writing project gave out less than 1 percent exemplary '4' scores. Such papers employed vocabulary and knowledge on a level sometimes exceeding that of the college graduate graders, and well above the intended audience of a high school graduation.&lt;ref&gt;At a grading session in Auburn in 2004, no graders could identify some of the words used in some papers&lt;/ref&gt; This level would be even more difficult than achieving an SAT score sufficient for entry into an Ivy League private college.
* Scores typically rise much faster than standardized tests such as NAEP or SAT given over the same time period.&lt;ref&gt;Rand study of Kentucky KIRIS&lt;/ref&gt;

A United States '''teaching credential''' is a basic multiple or single subject [[credential]] obtained upon completion of a bachelor's degree, from a college or university that holds [[regional accreditation]], and prescribed professional education requirements.  Teaching credentials are required in the United States in order to qualify to teach public school, as well as many other types of instruction.

'''''The Social Seminar''''' is a series of educational films for adults produced by the Extension Media Center of the [[University of California at Los Angeles]] in the early 1970s.  The series was executive produced by [[Gary Schlosser]], an Oscar-nominated producer of short-subject documentaries.  The films were distributed nationally, for example to state educational film offices.  The series was produced for the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] as a "multi-media training series."

Five episodes of ''The Social Seminar'' are known to have been produced: "Bunny," "Guy," "Teddy," "Tom," and "Changing."  Each depicted, in a [[cinema-verite]] style without voiceover or introduction, aspects of the lives of a selected person or family as they dealt with personal, interpersonal and societal change.  The episode "Changing," for example, showed how one man's reevaluation of his life and social standing led to his becoming a "hippie" in the eyes of his family and coworkers; though his home life was enhanced, he found himself increasingly socially isolated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/SocialSe1971 "Social Seminar: Changing (1971)"] Prelinger Archives, archive.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

The films are now part of the [[Prelinger Archive]] and are available freely online. In June 2011, "Changing" was featured on the [[Turner Classic Movies]] series ''[[TCM Underground]]''.

==In popular culture==
* Electronic music duo [[Boards of Canada]] sampled dialogue from the "Tom" episode of ''The Social Seminar'' in their song "Chromakey Dreamcoat", from the album ''[[The Campfire Headphase]]''.
* British rock band [[Bastille (band)|Bastille]] sampled dialogue from the "Changing" episode of ''The Social Seminar'' in their song "Fake It", from the album ''[[Wild World (album)|Wild World]]''.

An '''umbrella school''' is an [[alternative education]] school which serves to oversee the [[homeschooling]] of children to fulfill government [[education]]al requirements.

Umbrella schools vary greatly in what they offer and cost. Some offer group classes, a defined [[curriculum]], [[sports]], [[field trip]]s, [[standardized test]]ing, and more. Others exist only to meet the minimum legal requirements, allowing parents choice in their curriculum and methods of teaching, as well as freedom from an annual evaluation or testing requirements. Additionally, some umbrella schools follow a specific faith, while others are [[secular]].&lt;ref&gt;
Glavin, Chris. "Umbrella Education." K-12 Academics. Web. 3 June 2015.

&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the responsibilities of umbrella schools vary from state to state. Many states require schools to collect [[immunization]] and attendance records, and similar records as required for any publicly run school. Often umbrella schools operate under the same legal guidelines as [[independent school]]s. Some states have course and daily time requirements. In others, students are bound to the normal standard school year and records must be kept to prove that students fulfill the required amount of time.

The [[Higher Education Statistics Agency]] (HESA) became the official agency for the collection, analysis and dissemination of quantitative information about higher education in 1993. http://www.hesa.ac.uk/index.php/content/view/4/54/ It was set up by agreement between the relevant government departments, the higher education funding councils and the universities and colleges in 1993, following the White Paper “Higher Education: a new framework”, which called for more coherence in HE statistics, and the 1992 Higher and Further Education Acts, which established an integrated higher education system throughout the United Kingdom.

==Main topics==
Finance: income and expenditure; university; cost centre. The Finance dataset contains details of income and expenditure for all of the UK universities. These data are contained in a series of files for each year.

Student load: undergraduate, postgraduate (taught course or research); cost centre.

==Coverage==
Time Period Covered: 1964 - 1993
Country: United Kingdom

==Methodology==
The Finance data were collected from annual returns based on the university financial year (August to July).
Method of Data Collection: Annual returns from each university were collated by UCCA.
