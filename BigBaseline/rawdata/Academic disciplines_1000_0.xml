[[File:Marc, Franz - Pferde in Landschaft.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Franz Marc]]'s ''Pferde in Landschaft'', one of the artworks discovered in the Gurlitt collection (probably 1911, [[gouache]] on coloured paper).]]

In February 2012, the [[Prosecutor|District Prosecutor]] of Augsburg confiscated 121 framed and 1,285 unframed artworks found in an apartment in [[Schwabing]], [[Munich]] in the course of an investigation into possible tax evasion.&lt;ref name=BBC24818541/&gt; The apartment was rented to  Cornelius Gurlitt, the son of celebrated art historian, dealer, and war profiteer, [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]], and grandson of the art historian [[Cornelius Gurlitt (art historian)|Cornelius Gurlitt]].  Some of the paintings were immediately suspected of having been [[Nazi plunder|looted]] by the [[Nazi]]s during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The collection is largely undamaged and of remarkable quality. It contains [[Old Masters]] as well as [[Impressionist]], [[Cubist]], and [[Expressionist]] paintings by artists including [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Otto Dix]], and [[Max Liebermann]], among many others. Although German authorities seized the entire collection, Gurlitt was not detained. Not until 3 November 2013 did the magazine ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'' report the find.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt; News of the discovery was reported worldwide.&lt;ref name="Smale"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/arts/design/trove-of-apparently-nazi-looted-art-found-in-munich-apartment.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0 |title= Report of Nazi-Looted Trove Puts Art World in an Uproar |last=Smale |first=Alison |date=4 November 2013 |website= |publisher=''The New York Times'' |access-date= 18 March 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gurlitt initially refused to cooperate with investigators. He retained several dozen additional suspect paintings, kept not in Munich but in his home in Salzburg, Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26133532 |title=Nazi loot probe: More art found at Gurlitt Austria home, BBC News, 11 February 2014 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2014-02-11 |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2014, an agreement was reached whereby the collection confiscated in Munich was to be returned to Gurlitt in exchange for his co-operation with a government-led task force charged with returning stolen pieces to the rightful owners.&lt;ref name="DWdr 20140407"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dw.de/p/1BdMb |publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=7 April 2014 |accessdate=16 April 2014 |last=R |first=D |title=Gurlitt reaches deal with German authorities over vast trove of art}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gurlitt died on 6 May 2014.&lt;ref name="Cornelius Gurlitt - obituary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10811916/Cornelius-Gurlitt-obituary.html |title=Cornelius Gurlitt - obituary |publisher=Telegraph |date=6 May 2014 |accessdate= 28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His will bequeathed all his property to the [[Museum of Fine Arts Bern]], Switzerland, after all legitimate claims of ownership against it had been evaluated.&lt;ref name="BBC 7 May 2014"&gt;{{cite news|title='Nazi art' hoarder Gurlitt makes Swiss museum sole heir|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27306269|accessdate=7 May 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.artnet.com/in-brief/will-germany-keep-gurlitts-trove-from-the-swiss-14647#.U2ujUaPvmMk.facebook |title=Artnet news, Alexander Forbes, '&amp;#39;Will Germany Keep Gurlitt’s Trove from the Swiss?'&amp;#39; |publisher=News.artnet.com |date=2014-05-08 |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

In 1930 art collector Hildebrand Gurlitt was removed as director of the museum in [[Zwickau]] because he exhibited contemporary artists. After the Nazis came to power, he was stripped of his new job as director of [[Kunstverein Hamburg]], because his grandmother was a Jew.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lichtblau |first=Eric |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/nazi_policies_toward_jews_and_minorities/ |title='&amp;#39;Nazi Policies Toward Jews and Minorities'&amp;#39;, NY Times, 18 November 2013 |publisher=Topics.nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He moved the family to [[Dresden]] and built a prosperous business as an art dealer, specializing in modern art.&lt;ref name="Cornelius Gurlitt - obituary"/&gt;

Hildebrand was appointed as a dealer for the [[Führermuseum]] in [[Linz]], Austria.{{Clarify|date=March 2016|reason= vague. Appointed when?  by whom?}}  On instructions from [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Reich Minister of Propaganda]] [[Joseph Goebbels]], [[Hermann Göring]] personally appointed a Commission for the Exploitation of Degenerate Art.{{Clarify|date=March 2016|reason= vague. Created when?}}  The Commission in turn appointed a series of dealers approved by the official Nazi confiscation service, the [[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce|ERR]], to handle the marketing of these art assets. Four men who had been dealing in modern art for years were chosen: Karl Buchholz, Ferdinand Möller, Bernhard A. Böhmer and Hildebrand Gurlitt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-fo7jn3WTDsC&amp;printsec=frontcover | title= The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War| publisher=Random House LLC | author=Nicholas, Lynn H. |date = 1995 |accessdate=22 December 2009 | page=24 | isbn=9780307739728}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were instructed to sell these artworks abroad for foreign currency.  Hildebrand's extensive network of European and North American art contacts were invaluable in this.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Göring used the funds raised to grow his personal art collection, though the four men did not always report to the Commission all proceeds of their sales.&lt;ref name=BJParis&gt;{{cite web|last=Feliciano |first=Hector |url=http://www.bonjourparis.com/story/the-lost-museum/ |title=The Lost Museum |publisher=Bonjour Paris |accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the works of so-called "degenerate art" that the Commission sold off were many paintings stolen from noted French art dealer [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]].

[[File:Sworn Statement Dr. H. Gurlitt 1945.pdf|thumb|1945 statement by [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]] to Allied authorities, describing his dealings before and during the war and listing art in his possession]]

In May 1940 the Reich Propaganda Ministry sold to Gurlitt 200 paintings, including Chagall's ''The Walk'', Picasso's ''Farming Family'', and Nolde's ''Hamburg Harbour,'' for the small sum of 4,000 Swiss francs.&lt;ref name=Telg10439168/&gt;  Hildebrand similarly acquired 115 additional works of "degenerate art" in 1941.&lt;ref name=Telg10439168/&gt; It is estimated that, at his height, he had a personal trading collection of more than 1500 art objects.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicholas"/&gt;

Gurlitt used his position to sell art to domestic collectors, most notably to [[Bernhard Sprengel]], whose collection forms the core of the [[Sprengel Museum]] in Hannover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://derstandard.at/1216918696497/Entartete--Kunstgeschaefte | title=Entartete Kunstgeschäfte | work=Der Standard | date=6 August 2008 | accessdate=3 November 2013 | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captured with his wife and twenty boxes of art in Aschbach ([[Schlüsselfeld]]) in June 1945, Gurlitt claimed that the art was part of his personal collection, and that most of his collection and all of his records had been destroyed during the [[bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]] in February 1945.&lt;ref name="Suddeutsche"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/depot-mit-nazi-raubkunst-in-muenchen-der-verwerter-und-sein-sohn-1.1809631 | title=Depot mit Nazi-Raubkunst in München | work=Süddeutsche.de | date=3 November 2013 | accessdate=3 November 2013 | author=Mazzoni, Ira |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; He painted himself as a victim of Nazi persecution due to his Jewish heritage, and on those grounds he was released.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;
 
[[File:Liebermann, Max - Zwei Reiter am Strand - Gurlitt.jpg|thumb|[[Max Liebermann]]'s ''[[Two Riders on the Beach]]'' in the Gurlitt collection and subject to a claim by the descendants of the original Jewish owner]]

Although suspicious of his story, in December 1950 US investigators returned 206 items to Gurlitt, including [[Max Liebermann]]'s ''[[Two Riders on the Beach]]'', [[Otto Dix]]'s self-portrait, an allegorical painting by [[Marc Chagall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2493980/Nazi-art-loot-German-dealer-quizzed-U-S-military-just-war.html#ixzz2k9BmfvdM|title=How U.S. military quizzed German dealer of £1bn Nazi art loot just after the war|last=Enoch |first=Nick|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=9 November 2013|accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gurlitt continued trading artworks until his death in 1956.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicholas"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-fo7jn3WTDsC&amp;printsec=frontcover | title=The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War | publisher=Random House LLC | author=Nicholas, Lynn H. | date=22 December 2009 | page=24 | isbn=9780307739728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornelius Gurlitt (28 December 1932 – 6 May 2014) was a German [[Private collection|art collector]], son  of [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]]. He grew up in the [[Dammtor]] district of Hamburg with his sister Renate, who was born there in 1935. His great-grandmother was Jewish, which caused his father to be labelled as a "quarter-Jew" under the [[Nuremberg Laws|Nazi race laws]] in the ''Volkszählung vom 17. Mai 1939'', or so-called "German Minority Census" of 1939.&lt;ref&gt;This "German Minority Census" is available in digital form at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum Resource Center in Washington D.C. and at the German Federal Archives in Berlin-Lichterfelde. An unsourced copy of the database was published online by the [http://www.heartwebsite.org/ArchivalResearch.aspx Holocaust Era Assets and Restitution Taskforce] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109175142/http://www.heartwebsite.org/ArchivalResearch.aspx |date=2013-11-09 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery by German customs authorities==
In 2010 German customs officers detained Cornelius Gurlitt entering Germany from Switzerland carrying €9,000 (£7,500; $13,000) in cash,&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt; which he explained as the proceeds of a transaction with the Galerie Kornfeld in Bern. Gurlitt was allowed to go on his way, but he had aroused suspicions. Further investigation by the prosecutor's office, the federal police and the tax authorities uncovered a number of anomalies.&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt; Investigators discovered that Gurlitt had never been employed, had no obvious source of income, was not registered with the {{ill|Einwohnermeldeamt|de}} or with the tax authorities or social services, had never married, and had no pension or health insurance.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In late February 2012, the authorities searched his apartment, finding more than a thousand paintings valued at as much as €1 billion.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/kultur/kunst/1500-werke-von-picasso-bis-chagall-zollfahnder-entdecken-sensationellen-kunstschatz-in-muenchen_aid_1147066.html|title=Fahnder entdecken 1500 Werke von Picasso, Chagall und weiteren Künstlern|work=Focus|date=3 November 2013|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC24794970&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24794970|title=Nazi looted art 'found in Munich'|publisher=BBC News|date=3 November 2013|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FAZ_Nov22&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunst/der-fall-gurlitt/schwabinger-kunstfund-ein-dementi-weitere-meldungen-nuechterne-schaetzungen-12674903.html|title=Schwabinger Kunstfund: Ein Dementi, weitere Meldungen, nüchterne Schätzungen|work=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|date=22 November 2013|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The magazine ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'' stated that at least 200 pieces were believed to have been lost during the Nazi era.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;
The paintings recovered included works by &lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt; [[Ernst Barlach]], [[Max Beckmann]], [[Canaletto]], Marc Chagall, {{Interlanguage link multi|Hans Christoph|de}}, [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Honoré Daumier]], [[Eugène Delacroix]], Otto Dix, [[Albrecht Dürer]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Erich Fraaß|de}}, [[Conrad Felixmüller]], [[Bonaventura Genelli]], [[Ludwig Godenschweg]], [[Otto Griebel]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], [[Paul Klee]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Bernhard Kretzschmar|de}}, [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Wilhelm Lachnit]], [[Max Liebermann]], [[August Macke]], [[Franz Marc]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Fritz Maskos|de}}, [[Henri Matisse]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Emil Nolde]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Théodore Rousseau]], [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]], [[Carl Spitzweg]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], and [[Christoph Voll]].

==Initial legal handling of the Gurlitt case==
On 5 November 2013, Reinhard Nemetz, the head of the prosecutors' office in [[Augsburg]], said that 121 framed and 1,258 unframed works had been seized from the apartment of Cornelius Gurlitt in early March 2012,&lt;ref name=BBC24818541/&gt; including unregistered works by Chagall, Dix, Liebermann, and Matisse.&lt;ref name=BBC24818541&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24818541|title=Nazi trove in Munich contains unknown works by masters|publisher=BBC News|date=5 November 2013|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The art historian who first examined the collection, [[Meike Hoffmann]], claimed in print in 2010 that "not a single one" of these works was ever acquired by Hildebrand Gurlitt. Dr. Meike Hoffmann wishes to remark that this controversy derives from a misreading of her book on Bernhard A. Böhmer. In her book, the art historical term ‘Bildwerke’ is used. The term refers only to sculptures, which indeed Hildebrand Gurlitt did not take from the ‘Degenerate Art’ Confiscation. Of course, Meike Hoffmann has never questioned the fact that Hildebrandt Gurlitt dealt with other kinds of artworks from the ‘Degenerate Art’ Confiscation.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman's book (in German) ''Ein Händler "entarteter" Kunst: Bernhard A. Böhmer und sein Nachlass.'' Akademie-Verlag, Berlin 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-05-004498-9}}. (''Schriften der Forschungsstelle "Entartete Kunst"''),  p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; She stated to ''Focus'' that as many as 300 pieces had appeared in the 1937 Nazi [[Degenerate Art Exhibition]] in Munich.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC24794970/&gt; At the time of the interview with ''Focus'', she was trying to trace the original owners of the works and their surviving relatives.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt; Art historians asked that a complete list of the paintings be published in order that they be returned to their rightful owners.&lt;ref name=Telg10424957&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/10424957/Art-experts-demand-Germany-releases-list-of-1-billion-Nazi-art-trove.html | title=Art experts demand Germany releases list of €1-billion Nazi art trove | work=The Telegraph | date=4 November 2013 | accessdate=4 November 2013 | author=Alexander, Harriet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking to ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' magazine in November 2013, Cornelius insisted that his father had obtained the works legally and stated that he would not voluntarily return any of them to previous owners.&lt;ref name=BBCSpiegel&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24977814|title=Nazi-looted art: German collector says he owns pictures |date=17 November 2013|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spiegel interview"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/spiegel-interview-with-cornelius-gurlitt-about-munich-art-find-a-933953.htm | title=Interview with a Phantom: Cornelius Gurlitt Shares the Secrets of His Pictures | work=Der Spiegel | date=17 November 2013 | accessdate=18 November 2013 | author=Gezer, Õzlem}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feeling threatened by the intense media attention, Gurlitt's brother-in-law offered 22 works in his possession to the police for safekeeping.&lt;ref name=Telg10439168&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/10439168/Art-dealer-paid-Nazis-just-4000-Swiss-Francs-for-masterpieces.html|title=Art dealer paid Nazis just 4,000 Swiss Francs for masterpieces|last=Barnett |first=Louise|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=10 November 2013|accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCStuttgart&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24910093|title=German police check new art haul near Stuttgart |date=12 November 2013|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' revealed that they had received a letter from Gurlitt telling them that "the name Gurlitt may not appear in your magazine." Gurlitt then told two reporters from the ''[[Paris Match]]'', who confronted him in a Munich supermarket, that "Applause from the wrong side is the worst thing there is." ''Der Spiegel'' found this comment "puzzling."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/cornelius-gurlitt-reporter-spueren-den-kunstsammler-in-muenchen-auf-a-932755.html ''Der Spiegel''], 11 November 2013 (in German).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Portrait of a woman'' by [[Henri Matisse]] was directly traceable to the collection of [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]], a Jewish art dealer from Paris who had represented [[Matisse]] and [[Picasso]] and who had been forced to leave his collection behind when he fled France.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|last=Oltermann|first=Philip|title=German police recover 1,500 modernist masterpieces 'looted by Nazis'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/03/nazis-looted-modernist-masterpieces-germany-police|accessdate=3 November 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When approached by ''Focus'', Rosenberg's granddaughter, French television presenter [[Anne Sinclair]], who had been fighting for decades for the return of the art dealer's paintings, stated that she knew nothing of the existence of the painting.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2486251/Discovered-Billion-pound-art-collection-seized-Nazis-ordered-destroyed-discovered-rotting-food-dishevelled-Munich-apartment.html#ixzz2jbOnohDE|title=£1billion art collection seized by Nazis found in shabby Munich apartment|author=Hall, Alan|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=3 November 2013|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recovery efforts for ''Portrait of a woman'' were immediately undertaken on behalf of the Rosenberg heirs by [[Art Recovery Group|Christopher A.

It is believed the work was sold to a collector in Florida in 2002.

One of the last pieces that Cornelius Gurlitt sold was ''The Lion Tamer'' by Max Beckmann. After a settlement, initiated by the Lempertz auction house in Cologne, was reached between Gurlitt and the heirs of [[Alfred Flechtheim]], it was auctioned off for nearly £750,000.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt; Another work was reportedly sold in 1990 through the [[Bern]]-based gallery of [[Eberhard Kornfeld]].&lt;ref name="Suddeutsche"/&gt;

In March 2014, a BBC reporter was granted access to one of the locations where 238 of the seized works were stored. He viewed works such as [[Monet]]'s ''[[Waterloo Bridge (painting)|Waterloo Bridge]]'' (1903) and others by [[Picasso]], [[Cezanne]], [[Liebermann]], [[Renoir]], [[Courbet]], and [[Manet]].&lt;ref name="BBC 20140326"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26746697 |title=Cornelius Gurlitt: One lonely man and his hoard of stolen Nazi art |last=Evans |first=Stephen |publisher=[[BBC News Magazine]] |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 April 2014, a month before Gurlitt's death, an agreement was reached whereby the seized artwork was to be returned to Gurlitt in exchange for his co-operation with the government-led task force charged with determining which of the pieces was stolen and returning them to the rightful heirs.&lt;ref name="DWdr 20140407"/&gt;

===Schwabinger (Gurlitt) Art Trove Task Force===
An entity called the Schwabinger Kunstfund or Gurlitt Task Force was created to research the provenance of the paintings in the Gurlitt trove. However, after several years of operations under the direction of Ingeborg Berggreen-Merkel it was widely criticized for having few results and little visibility.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dw.com/en/task-force-investigating-art-trove-inherited-from-nazi-collector-achieved-embarrassing-results/a-18876659&lt;/ref&gt;

Berggreen-Merkel was accused of visiting the severely ill Gurlitt at his hospital bed and persuading him to sign over the ownership of his collection, allegedly as the only way to prevent Gurlitt from getting sued from various interest groups, Jewish or other. In early 2014 Gurlitt designated the Kunstmuseum as his sole heir. A few weeks earlier, Berggreen-Merkel had met with the President of the Museum's Foundation Council, Christoph Schäublin. One year later, her taskforce was dissolved. "We are disappointed," said Ronald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taskforce-kunstfund.de/en/chronology.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tagesspiegel.de/kultur/gurlitt-und-die-folgen-des-schwabinger-kunstfunds-kunstmuseum-bern-tritt-gurlitt-erbe-an/11021442.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/kultur/Laesst-sich-Bern-die-grosse-GurlittAusstellung-wegschnappen-/story/31357598&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death of Gurlitt, and after==
Cornelius Gurlitt died on 6 May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Nazi art' hoarder Cornelius Gurlitt, 81, dies|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-27298832|work=BBC|accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his will, written on his deathbed, Gurlitt named the [[Museum of Fine Arts Bern]] in Switzerland as his sole heir.&lt;ref name="BBC 7 May 2014" /&gt;  People close to Gurlitt told an American newspaper that he decided to give the collection to a foreign institution because he felt that Germany had treated him and his father badly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/swiss-museum-close-to-accepting-nazi-era-art-bequest-1416443643 |title= Swiss Museum Close to Accepting Trove of Nazi Art|last1= Lane|first1= Mary M.|date= November 20, 2014|publisher= ''The Wall Street Journal'' |access-date= 13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legacy included the paintings Gurlitt had kept in Salzburg, paintings which German authorities had not confiscated because their remit did not extend to property held in Austria. Gurlitt's decision created further controversy over the appropriateness of the museum accepting this bequest. The will stipulated that the museum would be required to research the provenance of the paintings and make restitution as appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, p. A12.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum decided to accept those works which are not legally the property of previous Nazi-era owners, or their heirs, and has entered into a joint-agreement with German and Swiss authorities about the handling of this bequest.

Gurlitt's family (cousins) also entered the discussion, raising questions about the legality of the will, based on his state of mind at the time. Gurlitt's cousin, Uta Werner, filed a claim of inheritance on the artwork. Werner's lawyer, Wolfgang Seybold, argued that Gurlitt's relatives were the rightful heirs. Seybold supported his argument with the opinion of psychiatrist and lawyer Helmut Hausner, who stated that Gurlitt suffered from [[schizoid personality disorder]], delusions, and dementia when he wrote the will bequeathing his collection to the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die 'Causa Gurlitt': Leichtgradig Kompliziert|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunst/der-fall-gurlitt/die-causa-gurlitt-leichtgradig-kompliziert-13273066.html|work=Franffurter Algemeine|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that a number of artworks will be returned to Gurlitt's estate, as he would have been considered the rightful owner unless the heirs of previous owners could prove that he obtained them through unlawful means.&lt;ref name="Welt"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.welt.de/kultur/kunst-und-architektur/article121499967/Wie-Picassos-in-einer-vermuellten-Wohnung-landeten.html | title=Wie Picassos in einer vermüllten Wohnung landeten | work=Die Welt | date=3 November 2013 | accessdate=4 November 2013 | author=Dittmar, Peter | language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; German authorities estimate that around 590 pieces need further investigation to determine whether they were confiscated under the Nazi regime, and a further 380 have been definitively identified as confiscated by the Nazis as "degenerate art".&lt;ref name="Schwabing art trove"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.lostart.de/Content/02_Aktuelles/2013/13-11-15%20PM%20Taskforce_EN.html?nn=9848 | title=Schwabing art trove: Provenance of treasures to be researched alongside criminal proceedings – suspicious works being publicised at lostart.de | publisher=the Bavarian State Ministry of Justice, the Bavarian State Ministry of Education, Science and the Arts, the Federal Ministry of Finance and the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media | date=11 November 2013 | accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art objects continued to surface after Gurlitt's death. In July 2014, a new discovery was made in his Munich apartment: two sculptures, possibly the work of [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]] and [[Edgar Degas|Degas]].&lt;ref name=sculptures&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-28464629 |title=Possible Rodin and Degas works found at Gurlitt home |publisher=BBC |date=24 July 2014 |accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, a landscape by Claude Monet was discovered in a suitcase Gurlitt had left in a hospital where he stayed.&lt;ref name=suitcase&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29085509 |title=Cornelius Gurlitt: Monet found in art hoarder's suitcase |publisher=BBC |date=5 September 2014 |accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
German newspapers questioned the prosecutor's right to seize the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Voss |first=Julia |date=17 November 2013 |title=Münchner Kunstfund: Wo bleibt der Rechtsstaat? |newspaper=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] |url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunstmarkt/muenchner-kunstfund-wo-bleibt-der-rechtsstaat-12668607.html |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunst/der-fall-gurlitt/schwabinger-kunstfund-politische-strafjustiz-12678004.html ''Politische Strafjustiz''] (in German) in the ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'', 25 November 2013, by Volker Rieble.&lt;/ref&gt; Property rights in cases of works of art acquired during the Nazi period are highly complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dittmar |first=Peter |date=7 November 2013 |title=Verbrechen lohnt sich |newspaper=Jüdische Allgemeine |url=http://www.juedische-allgemeine.de/article/view/id/17492 |language=de}}. This article refers in particular to works of ''[[degenerate art]]'', whose confiscation had been formalized by a Nazi law. ''Gesetz über Einziehung von Erzeugnissen entarteter Kunst'' (Act on the Confiscation of Works of Degenerate Art) of 31 May 1938&lt;/ref&gt; After the war the Nazi law legalizing possession of stolen works of ''[[degenerate art]]'' was deliberately upheld by the [[Allied Control Council]] in order that the trade in artworks could continue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geschkult.fu-berlin.de/e/khi/forschung/entartete_kunst/dossier/Broschuere_Heuer.pdf?1347697442 Heuer, Carl-Heinz (undated). "Die eigentumsrechtliche Problematik der ''entarteten'' Kunst" – "The problems surrounding ownership rights to ''degenerate'' art"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202235653/http://www.geschkult.fu-berlin.de/e/khi/forschung/entartete_kunst/dossier/Broschuere_Heuer.pdf?1347697442 |date=2 December 2013 }} (bilingual), on the website of the [[Free University of Berlin]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike in Austria,&lt;ref&gt;''Kunstrückgabegesetz 1998'' (''Art Return Law 1998'') See the [[:de:Restitution (Österreich)#Kunstrückgabegesetz 1998|German Wikipedia entry]] for details.&lt;/ref&gt; there is no law in effect in Germany requiring the return of Nazi-looted art, as long as the items in question can be proven to have been, at any point in time, legally acquired. As signatories of the [[Wiedergutmachung|1998 Washington Agreement]], Germany agreed that all of its public institutions would check their inventories for Nazi-looted goods and return them if found. However, this is on a strictly voluntary basis and, 15 years later, very few museums and libraries&lt;ref&gt;The [http://raubgut.zlb.de/index.php/About/Index_en Central and Regional Library of Berlin] is the only library in Germany to have full-time staff devoted to the search for Nazi-looted cultural goods.&lt;/ref&gt; have done so. Individuals are under no legal requirement whatsoever to return Nazi-looted art. A failure on the part of the German government to return the rightful possessions of Cornelius Gurlitt might have been a violation of his property rights as guaranteed in the German constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/2013/48/gurlitt-kunstwerke-raubkunst/seite-1 ''Fluch des Schatzes''] (''Curse of the Treasure'') in ''Der Zeit'', 21 November 2013 (in German). ''“German museums are accordingly, albeit rather hesitantly, searching for looted art in their collections, and from time to time works are returned. This is cumbersome, mostly unspectacular and takes far too long, but it is still the right way. But Cornelius Gurlitt is a private person, and therefore the principles of the Washington Agreement do not apply to his artworks. He cannot be forced, and it appears the government wants to seize the works, which is hardly possible in the face of the constitution.”''&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December 2013, prominent German art historian [[Sibylle Ehringhaus]], who was one of the first experts to view the artworks in the spring of 2012, gave an interview in the newspaper ''[[Augsburger Allgemeine]]'', demanding the immediate return of the complete collection to Gurlitt. However, she had looked at the works very briefly and had not researched their [[provenance]] because, as she stated in the interview, "Cornelius Gurlitt commissioned neither myself nor anyone else" to perform such research. Chief Prosecutor Reinhard Nemetz vehemently denied her appeal, yet apparently failed to cite any concrete legal grounds for the seizure.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/bayern/Interview-Kunstexpertin-fordert-Rueckgabe-aller-Bilder-an-Gurlitt-id27983722.html Interview: Kunstexpertin fordert Rückgabe aller Bilder an Gurlitt], ''Augsburger Allgemeine'', 4 December 2012 (in German) or a [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4590360/Ehringhaus_Gurlitt.pdf translation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001010/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4590360/Ehringhaus_Gurlitt.pdf |date=4 March 2016 }} of the article in English.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/bayern/Augsburger-Staatsanwaltschaft-weist-Vorwuerfe-der-Kunstexpertin-zurueck-id27992202.html Augsburger Staatsanwaltschaft weist Vorwürfe der Kunstexpertin zurück] ''Augsburger Allgemeine'', 5 December 2012 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 November 2014, the German jurist [[Jutta Limbach]], the head of the Limbach Commission on Nazi-looted art, confirmed the opinion of the German ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' newspaper that the Bavarian "State Prosecutor used an incorrect application of the tax liability law to seize" the artworks of Cornelius Gurlitt.&lt;ref&gt;''Süddeutsche Zeitung'', ''Ein Bild lässt sich abhangen, Schuld nicht'' (in German; English: "A picture may be taken down, but not the guilt"), interview by Heribert Prantl and Kia Vahland, 20 November 2014, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the artworks have been returned to the heirs of the legitimate owners, notably a portrait by Matisse restored to the heirs of French art dealer [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]]. Another major painting from the collection, ''[[Two Riders on the Beach]]'' (1901), by [[Max Liebermann]], was returned to the heirs of the German-Jewish industrialist and art collector David Friedmann,&lt;ref&gt;Eddy, Melissa (May&amp;nbsp;15, 2015).

==Swiss museum's acceptance of Gurlitt's estate==
On 24 November 2014, the Museum of Fine Arts in [[Bern]] agreed to accept the Gurlitt estate.  Museum officials stated that no art looted by the Nazis would be permitted to enter the museum's collection.&lt;ref name =Notorious&gt;{{cite web| url = https://news.artnet.com/art-world/gurlitt-collection-arrives-kunstmuseum-bern-1018277| title = The Notorious Gurlitt Trove of Nazi-Tainted Art Makes Its First Appearance at Kunstmuseum Bern| author = Neuendorf, Henri| date = July 10, 2017| accessdate = February 12, 2018| publisher = artmet.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 500 works were to remain in Germany until their rightful owners could be identified. Three pieces were singled out for immediate return: [[Henri Matisse]]'s ''Femme Assise'' to the descendants of the Jewish art dealer [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]], Max Liebermann's ''[[Two Riders on the Beach]]'' to the great-nephew of the industrialist and art collector [[David Friedmann]], and [[Carl Spitzweg]]'s ''Playing the Piano'' to the heirs of music publisher [[Henri Hinrichsen]], who was murdered at Auschwitz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30176190 |title=Swiss museum to accept Gurlitt 'Nazi art' |publisher=BBC News |date=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first public display of the Gurlitt art trove took place at an exhibition curated by the Bern Fine Art Museum, running from November 2017 to March 2018, which featured 160 works from the controversial Gurlitt art collection.&lt;ref name =Notorious/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/culture/bern-fine-arts-museum_gurlitt-exhibition-attracts-droves-of-visitors/43793524| title = Gurlitt exhibition attracts droves of visitors| date = January 2, 2018| accessdate = February 12, 2018| publisher = Swissinfo.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Economics sidebar}}
'''Applied economics''' is the application of [[economic theory]] and [[econometrics]] in specific settings. As one of the two sets of fields of [[economics]] (the other set being the ''core''),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aeaweb.org/students/Fields.php&lt;/ref&gt; it is typically characterized by the application of the ''core'', i.e. economic theory and [[econometrics]], to address practical issues in a range of fields including  [[demographic economics]], [[labour economics]], [[business economics]], [[industrial organization]], [[agricultural economics]], [[development economics]], [[education economics]], [[Engineering economics (civil engineering)|engineering economics]], [[health economics]], [[monetary economics]], [[public economics]], and [[economic history]]. The process often involves a reduction in the level of abstraction of this core theory. There are a variety of approaches including not only empirical estimation using [[econometrics]], [[Input-output model|input-output analysis]] or simulations but also case studies, historical analogy and so-called common sense or the "vernacular".&lt;ref name =Swann&gt;Swann, G. M. P. (2006) ''Putting Econometrics in Its Place: A New Direction in Applied Economics'' (published by Edward Elgar).&lt;/ref&gt;  This range of approaches is indicative of what [[Roger Backhouse (economist)|Roger Backhouse]] and Jeff Biddle argue is the ambiguous nature of the concept of applied economics. It is a concept with multiple meanings.&lt;ref name=backhouse&gt;Backhouse, R. and Jeff Biddle (2000) ‘[https://read.dukeupress.edu/hope/article-pdf/32/Suppl_1/1/427135/01-Biddlebackhouse.pdf The concept of applied economics: a history of ambiguity and multiple meanings]’, ''History of Applied Economics 32'' (annual supplement), 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Among broad [[Economic methodology|methodological]] distinctions, one source places it in neither [[positive economics|positive]] nor [[normative economics]] but the ''art of economics'', [[gloss (annotation)|gloss]]ed as "what most economists do".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=David Colander |last=Colander |first=David |year=1992 |title=Retrospectives: The Lost Art of Economics |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=191–198 [p. 197–198] |jstor=2138310 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the term==
The origin and meanings of Applied Economics has a long history going back to the writing of [[Jean-Baptiste Say|Say]] and [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]]. Say wrote about "applying" the “general principles of political economy” to "ascertain the rule of action of any combination of circumstances presented to us." The full title of Mill’s (1848) work is Principles of Political Economy with Some of Their Applications to Social Philosophy.&lt;ref name=backhouse /&gt;

==J.N. Keynes discussion==
[[John Neville Keynes]] was perhaps the first to use the phrase “applied economics”. He noted that the "English School" ([[John Stuart Mill]], [[John Elliott Cairnes]], and [[Nassau William Senior]])&lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart. 1877. Essays on Some Unsettled Questions of Political Economy. London: Longmans, Green and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Senior, Nassau. 1828. An Introductory Lecture on Political Economy. The Pamphleteer 29:33–47. Reprinted in vol. 1 of The Methodology of Economics: Nineteenth-Century British Contributions, edited by Roger Backhouse. London: Routledge/Thoemmes Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; believed that political economy was a positive, abstract, deductive science; and that this school made a clear distinction  “between political economy itself and its applications to practice" (1917, 12). This School thought that a general body of theory could be established through abstract reasoning&amp;nbsp;– not relying on a wide knowledge of economic facts. From this point of view applying this theory involved making allowances for some of the factors ignored in building the abstract theories.  Keynes wrote about applying the political economies hypothetical laws to interpreting and explaining of “concrete industrial facts." The issue of conceptual distinction between political economy as a science (involving formulating laws which govern  the production and distribution of wealth) and political economy as an art (using the laws to tackle practical problems).&lt;ref name=keynes&gt;Keynes, John Neville. 1917. The Scope and Method of Political Economy. London: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst noting the rival view of the historical economists, who believed that the goals being pursued by policy makers and the means to pursue them were an integral part of the science of economics, J.N Keynes believed in the desirability of the "English School's" distinction between the discovery of principles and their application (1917, 54).&lt;ref name=keynes /&gt;

Indeed, it was he who proposed using the phrase “applied economics” instead of “the art of political economy”.  Keynes further discussed the uses of the phrases applied political economy and applied economics noting three different uses:&lt;ref name=keynes /&gt;

# in the sense suggested in the text [in association with the art of political economy];
# to designate the application of economic theory to the interpretation and explanation of particular economic phenomena, without any necessary reference however, to the solution of practical questions;
# to mark off the more concrete and specialized portions of economic doctrine from those more abstract doctrines that are held to pervade all economic reasoning. (1917, 58–59) and applying theories of economy on what we have in reality to get a healthy enterprise and business prosperity.

==Other 19th and early 20th century economists use of the term==

[[Léon Walras]], for example, planned to organize his main work into volumes on "pure," "applied," and "social" economics. Jaffé (1983) describes Walras's plan as involving making a distinction between that which is true, is useful, and is just.  In using the term true, Walras referred to propositions that necessarily followed from the nature of things. Pure economics then involves pure logic. Applied economics involves examining ways to achieve practical goals and requires the making judgments about whether or not the logic of pure economics was relevant to the real world. Social economics also presumed pure economics, but dealt with a different range of questions than did applied economics.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffé,William. 1983.William Jaffé's Essays on Walras. Edited by Donald A.Walker. Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vilfredo Pareto]] ([1906] 1971, 104) follows as similar usage suggesting economics might begin by eliminating that which is inessential to  examine problems as reduced to their principal and essentials. He distinguishes between "pure economics" from "applied economics" with pure economics containing only the principal lines of argument and applied economics involving supplying the details.&lt;ref&gt;Pareto, Vilfredo. [1906] 1971. Manual of Political Economy. Translated by Ann S. Schwier. New York: Kelley.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Schumpeter]] (1954, 23) referred to some applied fields in economics the repetition of which might help highlight some of the issues involved in what defining applied economics involves. He discussed the following fields:&lt;ref&gt;Schumpeter, J. A. 1954. A History of Economic Analysis. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

# those that are typically thought of as part of economics but which also looked at individually to allow greater attention to detail – e.g. money and banking, trade, cycles, and location
# those that are independent of economics but study of them is needed for economics. These include subjects such as [[accounting]], actuarial science, and [[insurance]]
# those that are areas of public policy: agriculture, labour, transportation, utility industries, control of industry, and public finance
# [[comparative economic systems]]
# [[demography]]
# [[area studies]]

==More modern views==

===Mainstream view===
Modern mainstream economics holds the view that there is a body of abstract economic theory –  the "core"  –  and applied economics involves the practitioner in the lowering some elements of the abstraction of this to examine particular issues. This lowering of the level of abstraction may involve:&lt;ref name=backhouse /&gt;
* relabeling variables as more specific, concrete concepts;
* providing some structure to allow the drawing of more detailed conclusions;
* producing numerical estimates for some of the parameters ;
* using the analysis to interpret the real world phenomenon which are interpreted as examples of some more general class of events that the core theory might be used to examine.

===Economics as a science===
Pesaran and Harcourt (2000) describe [[Richard Stone|Stone]]'s attempt to face the challenge of making economics into a science by combining theory and measurement within a cohesive framework. They report Stone’s proposal for the establishment of the now famous Department of Applied Economics at Cambridge.&lt;ref name=Pesaran&gt;Pesaran, M. H.  and G. C. Harcourt (2000),“The life and work of John Richard Nicholas Stone 1913–1991,”Economic Journal&lt;/ref&gt; Stone argued that:
:''"The ultimate aim of applied economics is to increase human welfare by the investigation and analysis of economic problems of the real world. It is the view of the Department that this can best be achieved by the synthesis of three types of study which now tend to be pursued in isolation. The Department will concentrate simultaneously on the work of observations, i.e. the discovery and preparation of data; the theoretical appraisal of problems, i.e. the framing of hypotheses in a form suitable for quantitative testing; and the development of statistical methods appropriate to the special problems of economic information. The special character of the Department’s approach to problems of the real world will lie in this attempt at systematic synthesis."'' (Stone in Pesaran and Harcourt (2000) pp. 149–150)&lt;ref name="Pesaran"/&gt;

===Other views===

The basis for rival approaches tends to be the denial that sound theory can be made without some concrete linking with its area of application. Both the 19th century [[Historical school of economics|Historical School]] and the 20th Century [[Institutional economics|Institutionalists]] argue in this way. [[Wesley Clair Mitchell|Mitchell]] (1936) noted that those working in "specialized fields" had little use for kind of qualitative theory postulated by [[Alfred Marshall|Marshall]] and [[William Stanley Jevons|Jevons]]. Mitchell suggested that knowledge of "real markets," would cause the complexion and content of economic theory (Mitchell 1937, 26–28). [[Milton Friedman|Friedman]] shared this view that theoretical concepts might or rather should arise out of the analysis of real world data. For both Mitchell and Friedman economics should involve an interaction between examining data and formulating hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Wesley C. 1937. The Backward Art of Spending Money. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue which is related to the [[McCloskey critique]]. This is economists do not necessarily practice what they preach. In this context that is the claim to be an "applied economist," is just shorthand for saying they are looking at the real economy. What is being applied need not be "economic theory", as conventionally defined rather something more basic. [[Eli Devons]] made a distinction between three different kinds of "things", any of which might be being applied:&lt;ref&gt;Devons, Eli. 1961. Applied Economics: The Application of What? In The Logic of Personal Knowledge: Essays Presented to [[Michael Polanyi]] on His Seventieth  Birthday 11 March 1961 (no editor named). London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt;

* theoretical models;
* commonsense axioms, and
* theoretical concepts.

===Journals===

====''The Journal of Applied Economics''====
The Journal of Applied Economics publishes original contributions on applied issues in micro and macroeconomics. The primary criteria for selecting papers are quality and importance for the field. Papers based on a well motivated research problem that make a concrete contribution to empirical economics or applied theory are especially encouraged.

====''Applied Economics''====
''Applied Economics'' is a journal that interprets its subject area as "the application of economic analysis to specific problems in both the public and private sectors" and seeks to publish "quantitative studies, the results of which are of use in the practical field" and thus may help "bring economic theory nearer to reality"; ''Applied Economics'' is a leading peer-reviewed journal in economics and its practical applications.&lt;ref&gt;''Applied Economics'', [http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/Routledge/00036846.html Aims &amp; Scope] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105022013/http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/Routledge/00036846.html |date=January 5, 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''American Economic Journal: Applied Economics''====
This quarterly journal which began publication in 2009 is from the [[American Economic Association]]. It publishes papers on a range of topics in applied economics, particularly empirical microeconomic issues, such as in labor economics, development microeconomics, health,  [[education economics|education]], [[demographic economics|demography]], empirical corporate finance, empirical studies of trade, and empirical [[behavioral economics]].&lt;ref&gt;As described at ''American Economic Journal: Applied Economics'' [http://www.aeaweb.org/aej-applied/index.php links]  to back-issue titles and abstract.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''American Journal of Agricultural Economics'' ====
These journals are published by the [[Agricultural &amp; Applied Economics Association]].  The ''American Journal of Agricultural Economics'' has been produced since 1919, and publishes research in the "economics of agriculture and food, natural resources and the environment, and rural and community development throughout the world."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaea.org/publications/ajae&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Applied Economics Perspectives and Policy'' ====
Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy (AEPP) is the leading  peer-reviewed journal of applied economics and policy. Published four times per year by [[Oxford University Press]], it is the one of two journals published by the Agricultural &amp; Applied Economics Association (AAEA), along with the American Journal of Agricultural Economics (AJAE). Today is the leading journal in 'applied economics' with a 2011 impact factor of 1.552.The purpose of AEPP is to analyze areas of current applied economic research in an effort to inform the policy-makers and decision makers; and to generate connections between sub-fields of agricultural and applied economics in order to focus future research and increase knowledge of those in the field about the impact of public policy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaea.org/publications/aepp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique==

Backhouse and Biddle argues that the mainstream view, that there is an accepted "theoretical core" and that this can be applied in a range of areas, relies on this core having specific characteristics. That is that it has a wide scope and can be developed independently of individual applications. But they note that as with the definition of applied economics itself, there is within the economics profession, differing views as to what belongs in the core. Where one draws the line between research that is contributing to the core and research that is applying the core, and the relative importance or significance of research on topics in the core versus applied economics research.&lt;ref name=backhouse /&gt;

Some examples of the problems of applied economics from various fields and issues:
* Examples of problems of applied economics: [[Macroeconomics]]
One example of this is macroeconomics. In the 1960s and 1970s, macroeconomics was a part of the core of the subject. Why? Because macroeconomics was not only sufficiently important to be part of any economist's training, but also embodied a set of concepts and principles not found in microeconomic theory. However the replacement of Keynesian approach to macroeconomics with new classical macroeconomics and its successors, macroeconomics might now be regarded by the mainstream as merely an application of microeconomic theory.&lt;ref name=backhouse /&gt;

* Examples of problems of applied economics: [[Development economics|Development Economics]]
Another example is the situation within Development Economics. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s most development economist regarded  the application of standard "core" microeconomic theory to their area as being entirely inappropriate. An alternative set of models provided their core. This might be best described as the [[Structuralist economics|structuralist]] approach. More recently development economics texts have provided applications of mainstream core theory.&lt;ref name=backhouse /&gt;

* Examples of problems of applied economics: [[Economic growth|Economic Growth Theory]]
Comim uses the history of the economics of growth in order to illustrate the historical nature of the concept of applied economics. He first discusses the perspective of the theorists’ views of the applied dimension of their work and examines each from the perspective of the work carried out at the Department of Applied Economics (DAE) at Cambridge University. He emphasizes the divergences concerning economists’ understanding of the proper use of economic theory, divergences that might ultimately reveal the influence of distinct practices as far as applied economics is concerned and the role of institutional environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Comim |first=Flavio |year=2000 |title=On the Concept of Applied Economics: Lessons from Cambridge Economics and the History of Growth Theories |journal=History of Political Economy |volume=32 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=145–176 |doi=10.1215/00182702-32-Suppl_1-145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Examples of problems of applied economics: the [[Minimum-wage]] controversy
Leonard notes one area of disagreement amongst applied economists which became famous in the US. That was the minimum-wage controversy. He notes that the fierceness of this controversy was odd because the likely effects were small and that several seemingly more important policy issues such as (entitlement reform, health insurance, CPI calculation) generated nothing like the storm. His explanation is that while this controversy was not especially important to the economy, it was very important to economics and economics as a policy science. His explanation for this is that minimum wage research came to be seen as a test of the usefulness of applying neoclassical price theory to the wages and employment. In other words, it was not just a technical quarrel over such things as the sign and size of wage-elasticity but rather an installment in a long running  methodological dispute over whether neoclassical price theory is in reality of any use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leonard |first=Thomas C. |year=2000 |title=The Very Idea of Applying Economics: The Modern Minimum-Wage Controversy and Its Antecedents |journal=History of Political Economy |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=117–144 |doi=10.1215/00182702-32-Suppl_1-117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A critique of the dominance of [[econometrics]]
Swann (2006) queries the dominance of such econometric techniques within Applied Economics and suggests what he describes as the "vernacular of the everyday practice of economics" should be taken seriously. Swann points out that econometrics's privileged position has not been supported by its disappointing results  and rather suggests other applied techniques, the vernacular, are also worthy of consideration. These approaches to applied economics, include simulation, [[Engineering economics (civil engineering)|engineering economics]], case studies and common sense.&lt;ref name=Swann /&gt;

'''Architecture parlante''' (“speaking architecture”) is [[architecture]] that explains its own function or identity.

The phrase was originally associated with [[Claude Nicolas Ledoux]], and was extended to other Paris-trained architects of the [[French revolution|Revolutionary]] period, [[Étienne-Louis Boullée]], and [[Jean-Jacques Lequeu]].&lt;ref&gt;Emil Kaufmann. ''Three Revolutionary Architects: Boullée, Ledoux, and Lequeu.'' American Philosophical Society, 1952. Page 447.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emil Kaufmann]] traced its first use to an anonymous critical essay with Ledoux's work as the subject, written for Magasin Pittoresque in 1852, and entitled ''"Etudes d'architecture en France"''.&lt;ref&gt;Emil Kaufmann. ''Architecture In The Age Of Reason Baroque and Post-Baroque in England, Italy, and France.'' Harvard University Press, 1955. Pages 130,and 251.&lt;/ref&gt; In Ledoux's unbuilt plans for the salt-producing town of Chaux, the hoop-makers' houses are shaped like barrels, the river inspector's house straddles the river, and an enormous brothel takes the shape of an erect phallus.

==Nonce orders==
Within more practical applications, [[Orders of architecture#Nonce orders|nonce orders]], invented under the impetus of [[Neoclassicism]], have served as examples of ''architecture parlante''. Several orders, usually simply based upon the Composite order and only varying in the design of the capitals, have been invented under the inspiration of specific occasions, but have not been used again.  Thus they may be termed "nonce orders" on the analogy of [[nonce word]]s. [[Robert Adam]]'s brother [[James Adam (architect)|James]], in Rome in 1762,  invented a "British Order" featuring the heraldic lion and unicorn.  In 1789 [[George Dance the Elder|George Dance]] invented an [[Ammonite Order]], a variant of Ionic substituting volutes in the form of [[fossil]] [[ammonite]]s for [[John Boydell]]'s [[Boydell Shakespeare Gallery|Shakespeare Gallery]] in [[Pall Mall, London]]. In the United States [[Benjamin Latrobe]], the architect of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol building]] in Washington DC, designed a series of botanically '''American orders'''. Most famous is the order substituting corncobs and their husks, which was executed by [[Giuseppe Franzoni]] and employed in the small domed Vestibule of the Supreme Court.

==Beaux-Arts==
The same concept, in the somewhat more restrained form of allegorical sculpture and inscriptions, became one of the hallmarks of [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] structures, and thereby filtered through to American civic architecture.  One fine example is the 1901 [[New York Yacht Club]] building on 44th Street in Manhattan, designed by the team of [[Warren and Wetmore]].  Its three front windows are patterned on the sterns of early Dutch ships, and the façade fairly drips with nautical-themed applied sculpture.  The same team designed the 1912 [[Grand Central Terminal]], which also contains self-explaining architectural elements in the form of the oversized [[allegorical sculpture]] group, and in the ingenious way that the shapes, surfaces, steps, arches, ramps and passageways inherent in the structure constitute a language that helps visitors orient themselves and find their way through the building.  

The same year, [[McKim, Mead &amp; White]] designed the nearby Farley Post Office Building with its famous inscription adapted from Herodotus:  "Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds." 

The civic architecture of [[Washington DC]] provides some of the most poetic and most verbose inscriptions.  Beaux-Arts architect [[Daniel Burnham]] is responsible for the [[Washington Union Station]] (1908), with its inscription program developed by [[Harvard]] president [[Charles William Eliot]].  It includes over the main entrance this paean:   "Fire: greatest of discoveries, enabling man to live in various climates, use many foods, and compel the forces of nature to do his work. Electricity: carrier of light and power, devourer of time and space, bearer of human speech over land and sea, greatest servant of man, itself unknown. Thou hast put all things under his feet."

==Neo-Classical==
The 1932 Commerce Department Building, part of the capital’s [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-Classical]] building boom in the 1930s, has this extreme example:  "The inspiration that guided our forefathers led them to secure above all things the unity of our country. We rest upon government by [[consent of the governed]] and the political order of the United States as the expression of a patriotic ideal which welds together all the elements of our national energy promoting the organization that fosters individual initiative. Within this edifice are established agencies that have been created to buttress the life of the people, to clarify their problems and coordinate their resources, seeking to lighten burdens without lessening the responsibility of the citizen. In serving one and all they are dedicated to the purpose of the founders and to the highest hopes of the future with their local administration given to the integrity and welfare of the nation."

Beyond such inscriptions, in the United States the concept of ''architecture parlante'' likely reached its zenith in the [[Nebraska State Capitol]] (1922) and the [[Los Angeles Public Library]] (1925), both by architect [[Bertram Goodhue]] and both containing inscriptions by iconographer [[Hartley Burr Alexander]].  &lt;ref&gt; Masters, Magaret Dale, Hartley Burr Alexander--Writer-In-Stone, Margaret Dale Masters 1992  Appendix 1 &lt;/ref&gt;  With their extensive architectural sculpture programs, tile murals, painted murals, ornamental fixtures and inscriptions (Goodhue worked with a sort of multimedia repertory company of artists, like the sculptor [[Lee Lawrie]]), both of these buildings seem particularly eager to communicate a set of social values.

==Modernism==
With the advent of [[Modernism]], its formal rigor and its distaste for ornament of any kind, by 1940 or so ''architectural parlante'' was eliminated from the serious architectural vocabulary and found only in commercial and vernacular oddities such as [[The Brown Derby]].

[[Postmodernism]] has seen a revival of these ideas. [[Terry Farrell (architect)|Terry Farrell]]'s eggcup-surmounted headquarters for [[TV-am]] in London and the book-shaped towers of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] in Paris, can be seen as examples. [[Michael Graves]]'s unbuilt project, Fargo-Moorhead Cultural Center, also is a revivalistic example of Ledoux's Inspector's House of Chaux.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16056">'''Area studies''' (also '''regional studies''') are [[interdisciplinary]] fields of research and scholarship pertaining to particular [[geography|geographical]], [[nation]]al/[[Federal government|federal]], or [[culture|cultural]] regions.  The term exists primarily as a general description for what are, in the practice of scholarship, many heterogeneous fields of research, encompassing both the [[social sciences]] and the [[humanities]]. Typical area study programs involve [[history]], [[political science]], [[sociology]], [[cultural studies]], [[languages]], [[geography]], [[literature]], and related disciplines. In contrast to cultural studies, area studies often include [[diaspora]] and [[emigration]] from the area.

==History==
[[Interdisciplinary]] area studies became increasingly common in the [[United States of America]] and in Western scholarship after World War II. Before that war American universities had just a few faculty who taught or conducted research on the non-Western world. Foreign-area studies were virtually nonexistent. After the war, liberals and conservatives alike were concerned about the U.S. ability to respond effectively to perceived external threats from the [[Soviet Union]] and [[China]] in the context of the emerging [[Cold War]], as well as to the fall-out from the [[Decolonisation of Africa|Decolonization of Africa]] and [[decolonisation of Asia|Asia]].{{cn|date=August 2017}}

{{Double image|right|Diploma_de_Especialista_Universitario_de_la_Universidad_Complutense_de_Madrid.jpg|200px|Diploma-licenciatura-estudos-europeus-universidade.jpg|200px|[[Latin American studies]] and [[European studies]] are examples of Area studies, offered both in [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] and [[Postgraduate education|graduate]] degrees, the images show examples from [[Complutense University of Madrid]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www.ucm.es/amelat/interes&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Universidade Aberta|Aberta University]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www2.uab.pt/guiainformativo/eng_detailcursos.php?curso=14&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In this context, the [[Ford Foundation]], the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], and the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] convened a series of meetings producing a broad consensus that to address this knowledge deficit, the U.S. must invest in international studies. Therefore, the foundations of the field are strongly rooted in America.{{cn|date=August 2017}}  Participants argued that a large brain trust of internationally oriented [[political scientist]]s and [[economist]]s was an urgent national priority. There was a central tension, however, between those who felt strongly that, instead of applying Western models, social scientists should develop culturally and historically contextualized knowledge of various parts of the world by working closely with humanists, and those who thought social scientists should seek to develop overarching [[macrohistory | macrohistorial]] theories that could draw connections between patterns of change and development across different geographies. The former became area-studies advocates, the latter proponents of [[modernization theory]].

The [[Ford Foundation]] would eventually become the dominant player in shaping the area-studies program in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Condliffe Lagemann, ''The Politics of Knowledge: The Carnegie Corporation, Philanthropy, and Public Policy'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 the foundation established the prestigious Foreign Area Fellowship Program (FAFP), the first large-scale national competition in support of area-studies training in the United States. From 1953 to 1966 it contributed $270 million to 34 universities for area and language studies. Also during this period, it poured millions of dollars into the committees run jointly by the [[Social Science Research Council]] and the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] for field-development workshops, conferences, and publication programs.&lt;ref&gt;David L. Szanton, "The Origin, Nature and Challenges of Area Studies in the United States," in ''The Politics of Knowledge: Area Studies and the Disciplines'', ed. David L. Szanton (University of California Press, 2004), pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the SSRC-ACLS joint committees would take over the administration of FAFP.

Other large and important programs followed Ford's. Most notably, the [[National Defense Education Act]] of 1957, renamed the Higher Education Act in 1965, allocated funding for some 125 university-based area-studies units known as [[National Resource Center]] programs at U.S. universities, as well as for [[Foreign Language and Area Studies]] fellowships for graduate students.

Meanwhile, area studies were also developed in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy within the field==
Since their inception, area studies have been subject to criticism—including by area specialists themselves. Many of them alleged that because area studies were connected to the Cold War agendas of the [[CIA]], the [[FBI]], and other intelligence and military agencies, participating in such programs was tantamount to serving as an agent of the state.&lt;ref&gt;See Bruce Cumings, "Boundary Displacement: Area Studies and International Studies during and after the Cold War," in ''Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars'' 29 (1997). http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/cumings2.htm. Retrieved 2009-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that there is the notion that U.S concerns and research priorities will define the intellectual terrain of area studies.&lt;ref&gt;See Patrick O'Meara, "Changing perspectives on international education", (Indiana University Press 2010), pp. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Others insisted, however, that once they were established on university campuses, area studies began to encompass a much broader and deeper intellectual agenda than the one foreseen by government agencies, thus not American centric.&lt;ref&gt;Moseley, W.G. 2009. “Area Studies in a Global Context.” Chronicle of Higher Education. Nov 29. http://chronicle.com/article/Area-Studies-in-a-Global-Co/49284/&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably, one of the greatest threats to the area studies project was the rise of [[rational choice theory]] in political science and economics.&lt;ref&gt;See "Rational Choice Theory," by John Scott, in ''Understanding Contemporary Society: Theories of The Present'', edited by G. Browning, A. Halcli, and F. Webster (Sage Publications, 2000). {{cite web|url=http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~scottj/socscot7.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227085005/http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~scottj/socscot7.htm |archivedate=2009-02-27 |df= }}. Retrieved 2009-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt; To mock one of the most outspoken rational choice theory critics, Japan scholar [[Chalmers Johnson]] asked: Why do you need to know Japanese or anything about Japan's history and culture if the methods of rational choice will explain why Japanese politicians and bureaucrats do the things they do?&lt;ref&gt;See Chalmers Johnson and E. B. Keehn, "A Disaster in the Making: Rational Choice and Asian Studies," ''The National Interest'' 36 (summer 1994), pp. 14–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the demise of the [[Soviet Union]], philanthropic foundations and scientific bureaucracies moved to attenuate their support for area studies, emphasizing instead interregional themes like "development and democracy". When the [[Social Science Research Council]] and the [[American Council of Learned Societies]], which had long served as the national [[wikt:nexus|nexus]] for raising and administering funds for area studies, underwent their first major restructuring in thirty years, closing down their area committees, scholars interpreted this as a massive signal about the changing research environment.&lt;ref&gt;See Cumings article, cited above.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to an increasing interest in studying translocal, transregional, transnational and transcontinental phenomena, a Potsdam-based research network has recently coined the term "TransArea Studies" [http://www.uni-potsdam.de/tapoints/ (POINTS – Potsdam International Network for TransArea Studies)].

Other interdisciplinary research fields such as [[women's studies]] (also known as [[gender studies]]), [[disability studies]], and [[ethnic studies]] (including [[African American studies]], [[Asian American studies]], [[Latino/a studies]], and [[Native American studies]]) are not part of '''area studies''' but are sometimes included in discussion along with it.

==Institutions==

Some entire institutions of higher education (tertiary education) are devoted solely to area studies such as [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], part of the [[University of London]], or the [[Tokyo University of Foreign Studies]] in Japan. At the [[University of Oxford]], the School of Interdisciplinary Area Studies (SIAS)[http://www.area-studies.ox.ac.uk/][http://www.area-studies.ox.ac.uk/ School of Interdiscplinary Area Studies, Oxford] and [[St Antony's College]] specialise in area studies, and hosts a number of post-graduate teaching programmes and research centres covering various regions of the world.
[[Jawaharlal Nehru University]], New Delhi, is the only institution with immense contribution towards popularising area studies in India.
An institution which exclusively deals with Area Studies is the [[German Institute of Global and Area Studies|GIGA]] (German Institute of Global Area Studies) in Germany.  Additionally, [[Lund University]] in Sweden offers the largest [http://www.ace.lu.se/ Asian Studies] masters program in Northern Europe and is dedicated to promoting studies related to South Asia through its [http://www.sasnet.lu.se/ SASNet].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ace.lu.se/masters-programme/study-asia-in-lund|title=Study Asia in Lund!|author=|date=27 June 2017|website=lu.se|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout history, forms of [[art]] have gone through periodic abrupt changes called '''artistic revolutions'''.  Movements have come to an end to be replaced by a new movement markedly different in striking ways.  See also [[cultural movement]]s.

== Artistic revolution and political revolutions ==

The role of [[fine art]] has been to simultaneously express values of the current culture while also offering criticism, balance, or alternatives to any such values that are proving no longer useful. So as times change, art changes. If changes were abrupt they were deemed revolutions. The best artists have predated society's changes due not to any prescience, but because sensitive perceptivity is part of their talent of seeing.

Artists who succeeded enough to portray visions that future generations could live to see, often had to navigate an often treacherous path between their own capacity to see and execute what lesser artists could not, while still appealing to powerful patrons who could finance their visions. For example, paintings glorified aristocracy in the early 17th century when leadership was needed to nationalize small political groupings, but later as leadership became oppressive, satirization increased and subjects were less concerned with leaders and more with more common plights of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;citation needed&lt;/ref&gt;

No art owes quite as much to state power as French painting does. It was in the age of absolute monarchy launched by Louix XIV in the 17th century that the likes of Poussin and Le Brun put France in the forefront of European art. Versailles found its stately mirror in the powerful idea of classicism – a painting style, enduring in later artists like Ingres, whose austerity and grandeur express the authority of a world where Jove is very much in his throne.&lt;ref&gt;jonathanjonesblog&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of revolutionary art in conjunction with cultural and political movements:

*[[Trotskyist]] &amp; [[Diego Rivera]]
*[[Black Panther Party]] &amp; [[Emory Douglas]]
*Cuban [[Poster art]]
*[[Social realism]] &amp; [[Ben Shahn]]
*[[Feminist art]] &amp; the [[Guerrilla Girls]]
*[[Industrial Workers of the World]] &amp; [[Woody Guthrie]]

== Artistic revolution of style ==

[http://www.art-head-start.com/3d/squid/revolution300.jpg Here] is an example of an Artistic Revolution Pieces

== Scientific and Technological ==

Not all artistic revolutions were political. Sometimes, science and technological innovations have brought about unforeseen transformations in the works of artists.  The stylistic revolution known as [[Impressionism]],  by painters eager to more accurately capture the changing colors of light and shadow, is inseparable from discoveries and inventions in the mid-19th century in which the style was born.

[[Eugene Chevreul]], a French chemist hired as director of dyes at a French tapestry works,  began to investigate the optical nature of color in order to improve color in fabrics.  Chevreul realized It was the eye, and not the dye, that had the greatest influence on color, and from this, he revolutionized color theory by grasping what came to be called the law of simultaneous contrast: that colors mutually influence one another when juxtaposed, each imposing its own complementary color on the other.  The French painter Eugène Delacroix, who had been experimenting with what he called broken tones,  embraced Chevreul's book, "The Law of Contrast of Color (1839) with its explanations of how juxtaposed colors can enhance or diminish each other, and his exploration of all the visible colors of the spectrum.  Inspired by Chevreul’s 1839 treatise, Delacroix passed his enthusiasm on to the young artists who were inspired by him. It was Chevreul who led the Impressionists to grasp that they should apply separate brushstrokes of pure color to a canvas and allow the viewer’s eye to combine them optically.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/biography/Michel-Eugene-Chevreul&lt;/ref&gt;

They were aided greatly in this by innovations in oil paint itself. Since the Renaissance,  painters had to grind pigment, add oil and thus create their own paints; these time-consuming paints also quickly dried out, making studio painting a necessity for large works, and limiting painters to mix one or two colors at a time and fill in an entire area using just that one color before it dried out.  in 1841, a little-known American painter named John G. Rand invented a simple improvement without which the Impressionist movement could not have occurred: the small, flexible tin tube with removable cap in which oil paints could be stored.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/never-underestimate-the-power-of-a-paint-tube-36637764/?no-ist, May 2013, by Perry Hurt&lt;/ref&gt;   Oil paints kept in such tubes stayed moist and usable -- and quite portable. For the first time since the Renaissance, painters were not trapped by the time frame of how quickly oil paint dried.

Paints in tubes could be easily loaded up and carried out into the real world,  to directly observe the play of color and natural light, in shadow and movement, to paint in the moment.  Selling the oil paint in tubes also brought about the arrival of dazzling new pigments -  chrome yellow, cadmium blue - invented by 19th century industrial chemists. The tubes freed the Impressionists to paint quickly, and across an entire canvas, rather than carefully delineated single-color sections at a time; in short, to sketch directly in oil - racing across the canvas in every color that came to hand and thus inspiring their name of "impressionists" - since such speedy, bold brushwork and dabs of separate colors made contemporary critics think their paintings were mere impressions, not finished paintings, which were to have no visible brush marks at all, seamless under layers of varnish.

Pierre-Auguste Renoir said, “Without colors in tubes, there would be no Cézanne, no Monet, no Pissarro, and no Impressionism.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/never-underestimate-the-power-of-a-paint-tube-36637764/#P4ovFKfbRLyMIhQT.99&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the careful, hyper-realistic techniques of French neo-classicism were seen as stiff and lifeless when compared to the remarkable new vision of the world as seen through the new invention of photography by the mid-1850s.  It was not merely that the increasing ability of this new invention, particularly by the French inventor Daguerre, made the realism of the painted image redundant as he deliberately competed in the Paris diorama with large-scale historical paintings.&lt;ref&gt;"Speculating Daguerre: Art and Enterprise in the Work of L. J. M. Daguerre" by Stephen C. Pinson, Chicago, (2012) p. 1-12&lt;/ref&gt;  The neo-classical subject matter,  limited by Academic tradition to Greek and Roman legends, historical battles and Biblical stories, seemed oppressively cliched and limited to artists eager to explore the actual world in front of their own eyes revealed by the camera - daily life, candid groupings of everyday people doing simple things, Paris itself, rural landscapes and most particularly the play of captured light -  not the imaginary lionizing of unseen past events.&lt;ref&gt;Review of "The Lens of Impressionism," at University of Michigan Museum of Art, October- Dec. 2009 by Simon Kelly, Volume 9, Issue 1 Spring 2010, http://www.19thc-artworldwide.org/spring10/the-lens-of-impressionism&lt;/ref&gt; Early photographs influenced Impressionist style by its use of asymmetry, cropping and most obviously the blurring of motion, as inadvertently captured in the very slow speeds of early photography.

 [[Edgar Degas]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]  - in their framing, use of color, light and shadow, subject matter  - put these innovations to work to create a new language of visual beauty and meaning.

== Faking revolution: the C.I.A. and Abstract Expressionism ==

Their initial break with realism into an exploration of light, color and the nature of paint was brought to an ultimate conclusion by the  [[Abstract Expressionists]] who broke away from recognizable content of any kind into works of pure shape, color and painterliness which emerged at the end of the second world war.  At first thought of as primitive, inept works - as in "my four year old could do that"—these works were misunderstood and neglected until given critical and support by the rise of art journalists and critics who championed their work in the 1940s and 50's,  expressing the power of such work in aesthetic terms the artists themselves seldom used, or even understood.  [[Jackson Pollock]] who pioneered splatter painting, dispensing with a paint brush altogether, soon became lionized as the angry young man in a large spread in Life Magazine.

In fact, in a deliberate, secret and successful effort to separate artistic revolutions from political ones,  abstract expressionists like Pollack, Robert Motherwell, Willem de Kooning and Mark Rothko, while seemingly difficult, pathbreaking artists, were in fact secretly supported for twenty years by the C.I.A. in a Cold War policy begun in 1947 to prove that the United States could foster more artistic freedom than the Soviet bloc.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html&lt;/ref&gt;  "It was recognized that Abstract Expressionism was the kind of art that made Socialist Realism look even more stylized and rigid and confined than it was, " said former C.I.A. case worker Donald Jameson, who finally broke the silence on this program in 1995.  Ironically, the covert C.I.A. support for these radical works was required because an attempt to use government funds for a European tour of these works during the Truman administration led to a public uproar in conservative McCarthy-era America, with Truman famously remarking, "If that's art, I'm a Hottentot."  Thus the program was hidden under the guise of fabricated foundations and the support of wealthy patrons who were actually using C.I.A. funds, not their own, to sponsor traveling exhibitions of American abstract expressionists all over the world, publish books and articles praising them and to purchase and exhibit Abstract Expressionist works in major American and British museums. Thomas Braden, in charge of these cultural programs for the C.I.A.. in the early years of the Cold War, had formerly been executive secretary of the Museum of Modern Art, America's leading institution for 20th Century art and the charges of collusion between the two echoed for many years after this program was revealed, though most of the artists involved had no idea they were being used in this way and were furious when they found out.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/10/17/unpopular-front&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic Movements ==

=== [[Art in ancient Greece|Ancient &amp; Classical Art]] ===
Key dates: 15000 BCE / 400 BCE-200CE / 350 CE-450CE&lt;br /&gt;
Ancient - There are few remaining examples with early art often favouring drawing over colour. Work has been found recently in tombs, Egyptian frescoes, pottery and metalwork.&lt;br /&gt;
Classical - Relating to or from ancient Roman or Greek architecture and art. Mainly concerned with geometry and symmetry rather than individual expression.&lt;br /&gt;
Byzantine - A religious art characterised by large domes, rounded arches and mosaics from the eastern Roman Empire in the 4th Century.&lt;ref name=artmovements&gt;http://www.artmovements.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Gothic architecture|Medieval &amp; Gothic]]===
Key dates: 400CE&lt;br /&gt;
Medieval - A highly religious art beginning in the 5th Century in Western Europe. It was characterised by iconographic paintings illustrating scenes from the bible.&lt;br /&gt;
Gothic - This style prevailed between the 12th century and the 16th century in Europe. Mainly an architectural movement, Gothic was characterised by its detailed ornamentation most noticeably the pointed archways and elaborate rib vaulting.&lt;br /&gt;
First developed in France, Gothic was intended as a solution to the inadequacies of Romanesque architecture. It allowed for cathedrals to be built with thinner walls and it became possible to introduce stained glass windows instead of traditional mosaic decorations. Some of the finest examples of the style include the cathedrals of Chartres, Reims and Amiens. The term was also used to describe sculpture and painting that demonstrated a greater degree of naturalism.&lt;ref name=artmovements/&gt;

===[[Renaissance]]===
Key dates: 14th century&lt;br /&gt;
This movement began in Italy in the 14th century and the term, literally meaning rebirth, describes the revival of interest in the artistic achievements of the Classical world. Initially in a literary revival Renaissance was determined to move away from the religion-dominated Middle Ages and to turn its attention to the plight of the individual man in society. It was a time when individual expression and worldly experience became two of the main themes of Renaissance art. The movement owed a lot to the increasing sophistication of society, characterised by political stability, economic growth and cosmopolitanism. Education blossomed at this time, with libraries and academies allowing more thorough research to be conducted into the culture of the antique world. In addition, the arts benefited from the patronage of such influential groups as the Medici family of Florence, the Sforza family of Milan and Popes Julius II and Leo X. The works of Petrarch first displayed the new interest in the intellectual values of the Classical world in the early 14th century and the romance of this era as rediscovered in the Renaissance period can be seen expressed by Boccaccio. Leonardo da Vinci was the archetypal Renaissance man representing the humanistic values of the period in his art, science and writing. Michelangelo and Raphael were also vital figures in this movement, producing works regarded for centuries as embodying the classical notion of perfection. Renaissance architects included Alberti, Brunelleschi and Bramante. Many of these artists came from Florence and it remained an important centre for the Renaissance into the 16th century eventually to be overtaken by Rome and Venice. Some of the ideas of the Italian Renaissance did spread to other parts of Europe, for example to the German artist Albrecht Dürer of the 'Northern Renaissance'. But by the 16th century Mannerism had overtaken the Renaissance and it was this style that caught on in Europe. &lt;br /&gt;
Representative artists:&lt;br /&gt;
Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli, Filippo Brunelleschi, Raphael da Urbino, Titian, Michelangelo Buonarroti, and Donatello Bardi.&lt;ref name=artmovements/&gt;

===[[Mannerism]]===
Key dates: 1520-1600&lt;br /&gt;
Artists of the Early Renaissance and the High Renaissance developed their characteristic styles from the observation of nature and the formulation of a pictorial science. When Mannerism matured after 1520(The year Raphael died), all the representational problems had been solved. A body of knowledge was there to be learned. Instead of nature as their teacher, Mannerist artists took art. While Renaissance artists sought nature to find their style, the Mannerists looked first for a style and found a manner. In Mannerist paintings, compositions can have no focal point, space can be ambiguous, figures can be characterized by an athletic bending and twisting with distortions, exaggerations, an elastic elongation of the limbs, bizarre posturing on one hand, graceful posturing on the other hand, and a rendering of the heads as uniformly small and oval. The composition is jammed by clashing colors, which is unlike what we've seen in the balanced, natural, and dramatic colors of the High Renaissance. Mannerist artwork seeks instability and restlessness. There is also a fondness for allegories that have lascivious undertones. &lt;br /&gt;
Representative artists:&lt;br /&gt;
Andrea del Sarto, Jacopo da Pontormo, Correggio&lt;ref name=artmovements/&gt;

===[[Baroque]]===
Key dates: 17th century&lt;br /&gt;
Baroque Art emerged in Europe around 1600, as a reaction against the intricate and formulaic Mannerist style which dominated the Late Renaissance. Baroque Art is less complex, more realistic and more emotionally affecting than Mannerism.&lt;br /&gt;
This movement was encouraged by the Catholic Church, the most important patron of the arts at that time, as a return to tradition and spirituality.&lt;br /&gt;
One of the great periods of art history, Baroque Art was developed by Caravaggio, Annibale Carracci, and Gianlorenzo Bernini, among others. This was also the age of Rubens, Rembrandt, Velázquez, and Vermeer.&lt;br /&gt;
In the 18th century, Baroque Art was replaced by the more elegant and elaborate Rococo style.&lt;br /&gt;
Representative artists:&lt;br /&gt;
Caravaggio, Annibale Carracci, Gianlorenzo Bernini, Rubens, Rembrandt, Nicolas Poussin&lt;ref name=artmovements/&gt;

===[[Rococo]]===
Key dates: 18th century&lt;br /&gt;
Throughout the 18th century in France, a new wealthy and influential middle-class was beginning to rise, even though the royalty and nobility continued to be patrons of the arts. Upon the death of Louis XIV and the abandonment of Versailles, the Paris high society became the purveyors of style. This style, primarily used in interior decoration, came to be called Rococo. The term Rococo was derived from the French word "rocaille", which means pebbles and refers to the stones and shells used to decorate the interiors of caves. Therefore, shell forms became the principal motif in Rococo. The society women competed for the best and most elaborate decorations for their houses. Hence the Rococo style was highly dominated by the feminine taste and influence.&lt;br /&gt;
François Boucher was the 18th century painter and engraver whose works are regarded as the perfect expression of French taste in the Rococo period. Trained by his father who was a lace designer, Boucher won fame with his sensuous and light-hearted mythological paintings and landscapes. He executed important works for both the Queen of France and Mme. de Pompadour, Louis XV's mistress, who was considered the most powerful woman in France at the time. Boucher was Mme. de Pompadour's favorite artist and was commissioned by her for numerous paintings and decorations. Boucher also became the principal designer for the royal porcelain factory and the director of the Gobelins tapestry factory. The Vulcan Presenting Venus with Arms for Aeneas is a template for a tapestry made by this factory. &lt;br /&gt;
Characterized by elegant and refined yet playful subject matters, Boucher's style became the epitome of the court of Louis XV. His style consisted of delicate colors and gentle forms painted within a frivolous subject matter. His works typically utilized delightful and decorative designs to illustrate graceful stories with Arcadian shepherds, goddesses and cupids playing against a pink and blue sky. These works mirrored the frolicsome, artificial and ornamented decadence of the French aristocracy of the time.&lt;br /&gt;
The Rococo is sometimes considered a final phase of the Baroque period.&lt;br /&gt;
Representative artists:&lt;br /&gt;
François Boucher, William Hogarth, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Angelica Kauffman, Giovanni Antonio Canaletto, Velázquez Vermeer&lt;ref name=artmovements/&gt;

===[[Neoclassicism|Neo-classical]]===
Key dates: 1750-1880&lt;br /&gt;
A nineteenth-century French art style and movement that originated as a reaction to the Baroque. It sought to revive the ideals of ancient Greek and Roman art. Neoclassic artists used classical forms to express their ideas about courage, sacrifice, and love of country. David and Canova are examples of neo-classicists.&lt;br /&gt;
Representative artists:&lt;br /&gt;
Jacques-Louis David, Sir Henry Raeburn, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Thomas Gainsborough, Antonio Canova, Arnold Bocklin&lt;ref name=artmovements/&gt;

===[[Romanticism]]===
Key dates: 1800-1880&lt;br /&gt;
Romanticism was basically a reaction against Neoclassicism, it is a deeply felt style which is individualistic, beautiful, exotic, and emotionally wrought.&lt;br /&gt;
Although Romanticism and Neoclassicism were philosophically opposed, they were the dominant European styles for generations, and many artists were affected to a greater or lesser degree by both. Artists might work in both styles at different times or even mix the styles, creating an intellectually Romantic work using a Neoclassical visual style, for example.&lt;br /&gt;
Great artists closely associated with Romanticism include J.M.W. Turner, Caspar David Friedrich, John Constable, and William Blake.&lt;br /&gt;
In the United States, the leading Romantic movement was the Hudson River School of dramatic landscape painting.&lt;br /&gt;
Obvious successors of Romanticism include the Pre-Raphaelite movement and the Symbolists. But Impressionism, and through it almost all of 20th-century art, is also firmly rooted in the Romantic tradition. &lt;br /&gt;
Representative artists:&lt;br /&gt;
George Stubbs, William Blake, John Martin, Francisco Goya, Sir Thomas Lawrence, John Constable, Eugène Delacroix, Sir Edwin landseer, Caspar David Friedrich, JMW Turner&lt;ref name=artmovements/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3342">'''Biometeorology''' is the [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field of science that studies the interactions between the [[biosphere]] and the [[Earth's atmosphere]] on time scales of the order of seasons or shorter (by opposition to [[bioclimatology]]).

==Examples of relevant processes==
[[Weather]] events influence biological processes on short time scales. For instance, as the [[Sun]] rises above the horizon in the morning, light levels become sufficient for the process of [[photosynthesis]] to take place in plant [[Leaf|leaves]]. Later on, during the day, air [[temperature]] and [[humidity]] may induce the partial or total closure of the [[stoma]]ta, a typical response of many plants to limit the loss of water through [[transpiration]]. More generally, the daily evolution of meteorological variables controls the [[circadian rhythm]] of plants and animals alike.

Living organisms, for their part, can collectively affect weather patterns. The rate of [[evapotranspiration]] of forests, or of any large vegetated area for that matter, contributes to the release of [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere. This local, relatively fast and continuous process may contribute significantly to the persistence of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]s in a given area. As another example, the [[wilting]] of plants results in definite changes in [[leaf angle distribution]] and therefore modifies the rates of [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]], [[Transmittance|transmission]] and [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of solar light in these plants. That, in turn, changes the [[albedo]] of the ecosystem as well as the relative importance of the [[Sensible heat|sensible]] and [[latent heat]] fluxes from the surface to the atmosphere. For an example in [[oceanography]], consider the release of [[dimethyl sulfide]] by biological activity in sea water and its impact on atmospheric [[aerosol]]s.

==Human biometeorology==
The methods and measurements traditionally used in biometeorology are not different when applied to study the interactions between human bodies and the atmosphere, but some aspects or applications may have been explored more extensively. For instance, [[wind chill]] has been investigated to determine the time period an individual can sustain exposure to given temperature and wind conditions. Another important example concerns the study of airborne [[allergen]]s (such as [[pollen]]s and [[aerosol]]s) and their impact on individuals: [[weather]] conditions can favor or hinder the release as well as the transport and deposition of these allergens, sometimes severely affecting the well-being of sensitive populations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4136">'''Biotic Index''' (also called "Family Biotic Index") is a scale for showing the quality of an [[natural environment|environment]] by indicating the types of [[organism]]s present in it. It is often used to assess the [[water quality|quality of water]] in [[river]]s. It is measured from 1 to 10 and corresponds to the four basic water quality (Excellent, Good, Fair or Poor). The concept of the Biotic Index was developed by [[Cherie Stephens]] in an effort to provide a simple measurement of stream [[water pollution|pollution]] and its effects on the biology of the stream.

==Technique==
To assign a biotic index value to a specific water site, the tester first collects macro invertebrates from portions of the sample area of the stream, river or lake and separate them into groups of similar-looking organisms. More extensive testing can be done by looking for certain microscopic organisms.

Then an identification key is used to help determine which category or group the organism belongs in and allows a numerical value be assigned to that organism. A worksheet is then used to calculate the final value or score of all the organisms found. Depending upon the worksheet's equations, the score determines the condition of the water quality. 

==Usefulness of macro invertebrates==
Aquatic macro invertebrates have some general characteristics that make them very useful to assess stream health:
# They are abundant and found in water bodies throughout the world
# They are not extremely mobile  
# They carry out part or all of their life cycle within the stream or river.

Macro invertebrates limited mobility and extended presence in the water means that they are exposed on a continuous basis to water quality in that stream or river.  In particular, many of these organisms breath dissolved oxygen that is in the water. They are also easier to see at the time of sampling.

Not all the macro invertebrates found in samples are listed on the biotic index scoring sheets. This is because some do not rely on oxygen within the water for survival. Many are able to collect air from the atmosphere and hold a bubble alongside their body to use like a scuba diver uses a tank of oxygen. 

For those macro invertebrates that do rely on dissolved oxygen, some can only live in water that has a lot of oxygen.  Others can live in water that doesn't have much oxygen dissolved in it at all.  Generally, it is assumed that the more pollution there is in the water, the less oxygen.

==Classification==
The biotic index works by assigning different levels of tolerance to pollution to the different types of organisms. 
The types of macro invertebrates and other organisms found during sampling are broken into 4 groups:
# Pollution intolerant: These organisms are highly sensitive to pollution (Stonefly or Alderfly Larva)
# Semi-Pollution intolerant: These organisms are sensitive to pollution (Dragonfly Larva or Craw fish)
# Semi-Pollution tolerant: These organisms will be found in clean and slightly polluted waterways (Snails or Black Fly Larva)
# Pollution tolerant: These organisms will be found in polluted, as well as clean aquatic ecosystems (Leeches, Blood worms)

Some index worksheets combine groups 2 and 3 together, giving only 3 groups. Each group has a number assigned to it and is multiplied by the number of organisms found in that group. This is why identifying the type of organism is important.

The '''Cass identity model''' is one of the fundamental theories of [[LGBT|gay and lesbian]] identity development, developed in 1979 by Vivienne Cass.&lt;ref&gt; Cass, V. (1979). Homosexual identity formation: A theoretical model. Journal of Homosexuality, 4 (3), 219-235.&lt;/ref&gt; This model was one of the first to treat gay people as "normal" in a [[Heterosexism|heterosexist]] society and in a climate of [[homophobia]] instead of treating homosexuality itself as a problem. Cass described a process of six stages of gay and lesbian identity development. While these stages are sequential, some people might revisit stages at different points in their lives.

== The six stages of Cass' model ==
=== Identity confusion ===

In the first stage, ''identity confusion'', the person is amazed to think of themselves as a gay person. "Could I be gay?" This stage begins with the person's first awareness of gay or lesbian thoughts, feelings, and attractions. The people typically feel confused and experience turmoil.

To the question "Who am I?", the answers can be acceptance, psychological self-[[denial]] and [[Psychological repression|repression]], or rejection.

Possible responses can be: to avoid information about lesbians and gays; inhibited behavior; self-[[denial]] of homosexuality ("experimenting", "an accident", "just drunk", "just looking"). Men often keep emotional involvement separated from sexual contact; women often have deep, strongly emotional but non-sexual relationships.

The possible needs can be: the person may explore internal positive and negative judgments. Will be allowed to be uncertain regarding sexual identity. May find support in knowing that [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]] occurs along a spectrum. May receive permission and encouragement to explore sexual identity as a normal experience (like career identity and social identity).

=== Identity comparison ===

The second stage is called ''identity comparison''. In this stage, the person accepts the possibility of being gay or lesbian and examines the wider implications of that tentative commitment. "Maybe this does apply to me." The self-alienation becomes isolation.
The task is to deal with the social alienation.

Possible responses can be: the person may begin to grieve for losses and the things they give up by embracing their sexual orientation (marriage, children). They may compartmentalize their own sexuality&amp;mdash;accept lesbian/gay definition of behavior but maintain "heterosexual" identity. Tells oneself, "It's only temporary"; "I'm just in love with this particular woman/man"; etc.

The possible needs can be: will be very important that the person develops own definitions. Will need information about sexual identity, lesbian, gay community resources, encouragement to talk about loss of heterosexual life expectations. May be permitted to keep some "heterosexual" identity (as "not an all or none" issue).

=== Identity tolerance ===

In the third stage, ''identity tolerance'', the person comes to the understanding they are "not the only one".

The person acknowledges they are likely gay or lesbian and seeks out other gay and lesbian people to combat feelings of isolation. Increased commitment to being lesbian or gay.
The task is to decrease social alienation by seeking out lesbians and gays.

Possible responses can be: beginning to have language to talk and think about the issue. Recognition that being lesbian or gay does not preclude other options. Accentuate difference between self and heterosexuals. Seek out lesbian and gay culture (positive contact leads to more positive sense of self, negative contact leads to devaluation of the culture, stops growth). The person may try out variety of stereotypical roles.

The possible needs can be: to be supported in exploring own shame feelings derived from [[heterosexism]], as well as [[internalized homophobia]]. Receive support in finding positive lesbian, gay community connections. It is particularly important for the person to know community resources.

=== Identity acceptance ===

The ''identity acceptance'' stage means the person accepts themselves. "I will be okay." The person attaches a positive connotation to their gay or lesbian identity and accepts rather than tolerates it. There is continuing and increased contact with the gay and lesbian culture.
The task is to deal with inner tension of no longer subscribing to society's norm, attempt to bring congruence between private and public view of self.

Possible responses can be: accepts gay or lesbian self-identification. May compartmentalize "gay life". Maintain less and less contact with heterosexual community. Attempt to "fit in" and "not make waves" within the gay and lesbian community. Begin some selective disclosures of sexual identity. More social coming out; more comfortable being seen with groups of men or women that are identified as "gay". More realistic evaluation of situation.

The possible needs can be: continue exploring grief and loss of heterosexual life expectation, continue exploring internalized homophobia (learned shame from heterosexist society). Find support in making decisions about where, when, and to whom to disclose.

=== Identity pride ===

In the ''identity pride'' stage, sometimes the coming out of the closet arrives, and the main thinking is "I've got to let people know who I am!" The person divides the world into heterosexuals and homosexuals, and is immersed in gay and lesbian culture while minimizing contact with heterosexuals. Us-them quality to political/social viewpoint.
The task is to deal with the incongruent views of heterosexuals.

Possible responses include: splits world into "gay" (good) and "straight" (bad)&amp;mdash;experiences disclosure crises with heterosexuals as they are less willing to "blend in"&amp;mdash;identify gay culture as sole source of support, acquiring all gay friends, business connections, social connections.

The possible needs can be: to receive support for exploring anger issues, to find support for exploring issues of heterosexism, to develop skills for coping with reactions and responses to disclosure to sexual identity, and to resist being defensive.

=== Identity synthesis ===

The last stage in Cass' model is ''identity synthesis'': the person integrates their sexual identity with all other aspects of self, and sexual orientation becomes ''only one aspect'' of self rather than the entire identity.

The task is to integrate gay and lesbian identity so that instead of being the identity, it is an aspect of self.

Possible responses can be: continues to be angry at heterosexism, but with decreased intensity, or allows trust of others to increase and build. Gay and lesbian identity is integrated with all aspects of "self". The person feels "all right" to move out into the community and not simply define space according to sexual orientation.

== Criticisms of the model ==

Joanne Kaufman and Cathryn Johnson have argued that based upon more recent research, this model is less valid today than it was at its inception for several reasons:&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Joanne and Johnson, Cathryn (2004) Stigmatized Individuals and the Process of Identity, ''The Sociological Quarterly'', 45 (4), 807–33&lt;/ref&gt;

#This model does not take into account socio-cultural factors that can impact identity development.
#The nature of the [[social stigma]] and its management practices have changed since the inception of the model.
#The linear nature of the model would suggest that anyone who abandons the model or fails to go through each of the six stages would not be able to be considered as a well adjusted homosexual, which may no longer be true.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33232">'''Children’s rights education''' (or children’s human rights education) is the teaching and practice of children’s rights in schools and educational institutions, as informed by and consistent with the [[United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child]]. When fully implemented, a children's rights education program consists of both a curriculum to teach children their human rights, and framework to operate the school in a manner that respects children's rights. Articles [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art29 29] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art42 42] of the Convention on the Rights of the Child require children to be educated about their rights.

In addition to meeting legal obligations of the Convention to spread awareness of children’s rights to children and to adults, teaching children about their rights has the benefits of improving their awareness of rights in general, making them more respectful of other people's rights, and empowering them to take action in support of other people's rights. Early programs to teach children about their rights, in Belgium, Canada, England and New Zealand have provided evidence of this.&lt;ref name=impact /&gt;&lt;ref name=moral /&gt;&lt;ref name=dead /&gt;&lt;ref name=empower /&gt;&lt;ref name=belgium /&gt;&lt;ref name=wallberg /&gt;&lt;ref name=comp6 /&gt; Children's rights in schools were taught and practiced as an ethos of 'liberating the child' well before the UN Convention was written, and that this practice helped to inform the values and philosophy of the Convention, the IBE and UNESCO, though sadly these practices, and this history are not really acknowledged or built-upon by the UN. This is one reasons that children's rights have not become a foundation of schools despite 100 years of struggle.&lt;ref name="newman movement"&gt;Newman, Michael (2015) Children’s Rights in our Schools – the movement to liberate the child, an introduction to the New Ideals in Education Conferences 1914-1937, [https://www.academia.edu/14081708/Regaining_the_History_of_Childrens_Rights_in_Schools_Through_the_New_Ideals_in_Education_Conferences_1914-37 www.academia.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning of children’s human rights education==
Children’s human rights education refers to education and educational practices in schools and educational institutions that are consistent with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.&lt;ref name=empower&gt;Howe, R.B. and Covell, K. (2007). ''Empowering Children: Children’s Rights Education as a Pathway to Citizenship''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=krappman&gt;Krappman, L. (2006). "The rights of the child as a challenge to human rights education." ''Journal of Social Science Education.'' Retrieved from: http://www.jsse.org/2006-1/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=osler&gt;Osler, A., and Starkey, H. (2006). "Education for democratic citizenship: A review of research, policy and practice 1995-2005." ''Research Papers in Education,'' 21 (4), 433-466.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a form of education that takes seriously the view that children are bearers of human rights, that children are citizens in their own right, that schools and educational institutions are learning communities where children learn (or fail to learn) the values and practices of human rights and citizenship, and that educating children about their own basic human rights is a legal obligation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. 

Children's rights education is education where the rights of the child, as described in the Convention, is taught and practiced in individual classrooms. But in its most developed form, children’s rights are taught and practiced in a systematic and comprehensive way across grade levels, across the school, and across school districts. With full-blown children’s rights education, children’s rights are not simply an addition to a particular subject or classroom. Rather, the rights of the child are incorporated into the school curricula, teaching practices, and teaching materials across subjects and grade levels and are the centerpiece of school mission statements, behavior codes, and school policies and practices.&lt;ref name=implement&gt;Covell, K., Howe, R.B., and McNeil, J.K. (2010). "Implementing children’s human rights education in schools." ''Improving Schools,'' 13 (2), 117-132.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fully developed children’s rights education means that all members of the school community receive education on the rights of the child. The Convention serves as a values framework for the life and functioning of the school or educational institution and for efforts to promote a more positive school climate and school culture for learning.

A core belief in children’s rights education is that when children learn about their own basic human rights, this learning serves as an important foundation for their understanding and support of human rights more broadly.

==Education and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child==
The Convention on the Rights of the child has important implications for the education of children. Approved by the [[United Nations]] in 1989, the Convention is the most widely ratified and most quickly ratified country in world history. Only two countries – the [[United States]] and [[South Sudan]] – have yet to ratify the [[treaty]].&lt;ref name=CRIN&gt;Child Rights Information Network (2008).  [http://www.crin.org/resources/treaties/CRC.asp?catName=International+Treatie ''Convention on the Rights of the Child''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103092514/http://www.crin.org/resources/treaties/CRC.asp?catName=International+Treatie# |date=2012-11-03 }}.

(1999). ''A Commentary on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.'' The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=verhellen&gt;Verhellen, E. (1994). ''Convention on the Rights of the Child.'' Kessel-Lo, Belgium: Garant&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bueren&gt;Van Bueren, G. (1992). ''The international Law on the Rights of the Child.'' Dordrecht: Martinus Nijhoff.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the terms of the Convention, a legally binding treaty, states parties have the obligation to make their laws, policies, and practices consistent with the provisions of the Convention, if not immediately, then over time.

In the Convention are numerous articles that deal with education and with children’s rights education. Eugeen Verhellen has divided the Convention’s provisions on education along three tracks.&lt;ref name=verhellen2&gt;Verhellen, E. (1993). "Children’s rights and education." ''School Psychology International,'' 14 (3), 199-208.&lt;/ref&gt; First is the child’s right to education on the basis equal opportunity ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art28 article 28]). This includes the right to free primary education and to accessible secondary and higher education. Second are the child’s rights in education (articles [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art2 2], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art12 12], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art13 13], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art14 14], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art15 15], and [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art19 19]). This includes the right to non-discrimination, participation, protection from abuse and violence, and freedom of thought, expression, and religion. Third are the child’s rights through education (article [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art29 29] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art42 42]). This refers to education where children are able to know and understand their rights and to develop respect for human rights, including their own human rights.

This third track of education spells an obligation by countries and education authorities to provide for children’s human rights education. Article 29 of the Convention requires that 'the education of the child shall be directed to the development of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.' This presumes knowledge and understanding of rights. Article 42 requires that countries 'undertake to make the principles of the Convention widely known, by appropriate and active means, to adults and children alike.'

Mindful of this duty of disseminating knowledge and recognizing its importance, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, the UN body responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Convention, has repeatedly urged countries to incorporate children’s rights into the school curricula and ensure that children know and understand their rights on a systematic and comprehensive basis.&lt;ref name=empower /&gt;&lt;ref name=un&gt;United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (1991). ''General Guidelines Regarding the Form and Content of Initial Reports.'' CRC/C/5. New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hodgkin&gt;Hodgkin, R., and Newell, P. (1998). ''Implementation handbook for the Convention on the Rights of the Child.'' New York: UNICEF.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Value of children’s human rights education==
Children’s rights education in schools has value because it fulfills the obligations of countries to respect the rights of the child and implement the provisions of the Convention. But beyond the fulfillment of a legal obligation, children’s rights education has value for children. Felisa Tibbitts has suggested that child rights education can be expected to affect learners in three ways.&lt;ref name=tibbitts&gt;Tibbitts, F. (1997). ''An Annotated Primer for Selecting Democratic and Human Rights Education Teaching Materials.'' Amsterdam: Open Society Institute/Human Rights education Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;  First is in the providing of basic information and knowledge on the nature of rights and the specific rights that children are to enjoy. Children can be expected to have a more accurate and deeper understanding of rights. Second is in attitudes, values, and behaviors consistent with the understanding of rights. Children can be expected to have greater respect for the rights of others as shown in their attitudes and behaviors. Third is in empowering children to take action in support of the rights of others. Tibbitts refers to this as the 'transformational model' of rights education. Children here are more likely to take a stand in preventing or redressing human rights abuses. An example would be to support a victim of [[bullying]] and stand up against a bully in the school playground.

Research by Katherine Covell and R. Brian Howe&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130405010253/http://www.cbu.ca/crc/ Katherine Covell and R. Brian Howe]&lt;/ref&gt; (see the section on evaluations of children’s human rights education) shows evidence of the above effects.&lt;ref name=impact&gt;Covell, K., and Howe, R.B. (1999). "The Impact of Children’s Rights Education: A Canadian study." ''International Journal of Children’s Rights,'' 7, 171-183.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=moral&gt;Covell, K., and Howe, R.B. (2001).

"'If there’s a dead rat, don’t leave it.' Young children's understanding of their citizenship rights and responsibilities." ''Cambridge Journal of Education,'' 38 (3), 321-339.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to children who have not received children’s rights education, children who have received children's rights education are more likely to have an accurate and adult-like understanding of rights, to understand that rights and responsibilities are related, and to display socially responsible behaviors in support of the rights of others.

==Implementation of children’s human rights education==

===Early initiatives===
Including Janusz Korczak and his rights based Warsaw orphanage, Homer Lane and his Little Commonwealth (1913) of delinquent 'prisoners', A.S. Neill's Summerhill School (1921) there have been many schools and children's communities around the world that have been founded on the rights of children. Indeed, inspired by Montessori, Homer Lane and Harriet Finley Johnson, a community of teachers, educationalists, suffragists, politicians, inspectors and cultural contributors formed a community called the  New Ideals in Education Conferences (1914-37)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/New-Ideals-in-Education-Conferences-386690128169894/?ref=bookmarks New Ideals in Education Conferences (1914-37)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newman movement"/&gt; Their founding value was 'the liberation of the child' and they sought, shared and celebrated examples of practice in schools, prisons and child communities. They contributed to the 'child centred' primary school.&lt;ref&gt;Selleck, R.J.W. (1972) English Primary Education and the Progressives, 1914-1939, p156 Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul London and Boston {{ISBN|0710072082}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been an overlooked history of the culture of the rights of the child, one that needs to be shared and celebrated to help empower children and those adults who work with them. &lt;!-- (Commenting this out for now, as it's a non sequitur. If you can add some context as to why this is pertinent to the topic, please do. Thanks!) The autobiographical novel by A.S. Neill, ''[[A Dominie's Log]]'' (1915), is a diary of a headteacher trying to liberate his children as the First World War begins.--&gt;

Since the approval by the United Nations of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989, various efforts have been made to provide children's rights education in schools.&lt;ref name=empower /&gt;&lt;ref name=educate&gt;Howe, R.B., and Covell, K. (2013). ''Education in the Best Interests of the Child: A Children’s Rights Perspective on Closing the Achievement Gap.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initiatives have been undertaken mainly at the level of individual classrooms and schools. Among the earliest initiatives was one in a primary school in [[Bruges]], [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name=belgium&gt;DeCoene, J., and  De Cock, R. (1996). "The Children's Rights Project in the Primary School 'De vrijdagmarkt' in Bruges. In E. Verhellen (Ed.), ''Monitoring children’s rights.'' (pp. 627-636). The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was a comprehensive child rights education project that was introduced in the early 1990s at De Vrijdagmarkt Primary School. It involved children ages 3 to 12 with the objective of educating them about the contents of the Convention, using democratic [[pedagogy]] and ensuring child participation in the learning process. Children were taught about their rights under the Convention through a variety of media including art and poetry. Art activities included newspaper collages representing examples of rights violations. Allowance was made for child-initiated and small group activities, role-play, and group discussion. Activities that were selected were ones of relevance and interest to the children. Younger children, for example, learned about the right to food by creating a very large doll with illustrations of food. Older children engaged in discussions and role-play regarding rights to [[adoption]], education, and family.

Further examples of early initiatives were in classrooms in [[Cape Breton Island|Cape Breton]], [[Canada]], in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name=impact /&gt;&lt;ref name=moral /&gt; [[Curriculum]] materials based on the Convention were developed in collaboration with children and their teachers for three grade levels. At the grade 6 level (children aged 11 to 13 years), education focused on introducing child rights in terms of their relevance to the individual child. Issues included healthy living, personal safety, families and family life, drug use, and decision-making. For example, to learn about their right to protection from [[narcotics]], students role-played children and drug dealers and examined ways of dealing with pressure to try or sell drugs. At the grade 8 level (ages 13 to 15 years), the focus was on relationships of relevance to the child. The curriculum included units on [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[Youth justice in Canada|youth justice]], [[child abuse]], and exploitation. For example, students analyzed popular song lyrics to discuss how rights in sexuality are represented in music, and they completed cartoons that involved the competing considerations of freedom of speech and rights against [[discrimination]].  The grade 12 curriculum (for ages 17 to 19) expanded the sphere of children’s rights knowledge with application to global issues. These issues included war-affected children and [[child labor]]. At this level, activities included holding a mock UN Conference on war-affected children where small groups had responsibility for representing the players at the conference, and a [[sweatshop]] talk show in which groups researched child labor and then held a talk show to discuss their findings.

===Hampshire, England===
Writings about the initiative in Cape Breton schools inspired a major initiative in [[Hampshire|Hampshire County]], [[England]], called Rights, Respect and Responsibility or the RRR initiative. It is among the best known and most promising models of children’s human rights education to date.&lt;ref name=implement /&gt;&lt;ref name=rrr&gt;Covell, K., and Howe, R.B. (2008). "Rights, Respect and Responsibility: Final Report on the County of Hampshire Rights Education Initiative." Available at:  {{cite web |url=http://www.hants.gov.uk/education/childrensrights/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106212258/http://www3.hants.gov.uk/education/childrensrights/ |archivedate=2012-11-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an initiative that features not only individual classrooms and schools but a whole school district. The RRR initiative was impelled by the recognition among senior education administrators in Hampshire of the need for a shared values framework and positive school climate for improved learning and educational outcomes. They also were motivated by their reading of the success of the rights education project in Cape Breton.

After study leave in Cape Breton, a group of Hampshire administrators and teachers decided to pilot test and then launch their own version of child rights education in Hampshire. After successful pilot testing in 2002, they officially launched RRR in 2004.&lt;ref name=hants&gt;Hampshire Education Authority (2003). "The case for RRR." Available at: {{cite web |url=http://www3.hants.gov.uk/education/hias/childrensrights/rrrthecase.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121223170331/http://www3.hants.gov.uk/education/hias/childrensrights/rrrthecase.htm |archivedate=2012-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To put the objectives of RRR into effect, Hampshire authorities—with funding from the [[Ministry of Education (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Education]]—devised a three-year strategic plan of implementation. This included provisions for teacher training, development of resources, and monitoring of developments. The plan was that the initiative would first be introduced in infant, primary, and junior schools and then over time, as children went into higher grades, it would be introduced in secondary schools. By 2012, in varying degrees of implementation, the majority of Hampshire schools were participating in RRR.

The overall objective of RRR was to improve educational outcomes for children by transforming school cultures, building a shared values framework based on the Convention, and promoting educational practices consistent with the Convention. Knowledge and understanding of rights, respect, and social responsibility were to provide the values framework for all school policies, classroom practices, codes of conduct, mission statements, school regulations, and school curricula. The framework was to be put into effect across the whole school – across classrooms, across grade levels, across curricula, and across school practices. Of particular importance, consistent with children’s participation rights as described in article 12 of the Convention, behavior codes, rules, and regulations were to be developed in collaboration with the children, classroom teaching was to be democratic, and children were to be provided with numerous meaningful opportunities to participate in all aspects of school functioning.

===New Zealand===
Initiatives in Cape Breton and Hampshire have influenced developments in other schools, school districts, and even countries. Among the more ambitious developments have been seen in [[New Zealand]] where efforts are underway to make children’s human rights education a nationwide initiative. The context for the initiative is favorable. A strong human rights theme runs through New Zealand’s Education Act, national education goals, and national administrative guidelines.  In the early 2000s, initial discussions about incorporating children’s rights education into the New Zealand curriculum were given momentum by the evidence provided from the Cape Breton and Hampshire County initiatives.&lt;ref name=hrie&gt;HRiE., (2009).  "Human Rights in Education, 2009 Report." Available at: http://www.rightsined.org.nz {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029140555/http://www.rightsined.org.nz/ |date=2012-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like elsewhere, educators and human rights advocates in New Zealand had been concerned with poor achievement levels, bullying, and violent behaviors that are observed among a significant minority of children in schools. And also like elsewhere, teachers and administrators have been frustrated by the range of difficult demands in schools, the fragmentation of efforts to address common problems, and the disappointing results of those efforts. Learning about successes in the Cape Breton and Hampshire initiatives, the collaborative initiative Human Rights in Education/Mana Tika Tangata (HRiE) was formed. Its aim was to develop positive school cultures on the basis of the rights of the child and to improve achievement for all children through having schools and early childhood education centers become learning communities that know, promote, and live human rights and responsibilities.
 
To achieve this goal, HRiE has been following the Hampshire model in using children’s rights as an overarching and integrating values framework for teaching, learning, and school management and organization. All members of the school community – school leadership, teachers and other staff, students, boards of trustees, and parents – learn about children’s rights and the responsibilities that go with them. They recognize that every member of the school community has the right to be treated with dignity and to participate in effective education. Students are formally recognized as citizens of the school and country with explicit rights and responsibilities. They participate in decision-making across the school, and rights are embedded across the curriculum, school practices, and policies.

===Initiatives with preschool===
Children's rights education initiatives also have occurred at the preschool level. For example, Canadian educators Pamela Wallberg and Maria Kahn introduced rights education to an early childhood program group of 3 and 4 year-old children in [[British Columbia]] over a three-month period.&lt;ref name=wallberg&gt;Wallberg, P., and  Kahn, M. (2011). "The Rights Project: How rights education transformed a classroom." ''Canadian Children,'' 36 (1), 31-35.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of "The Rights Project" was motivated in large part by observations of the children’s self-focus and disregard for the feelings of their peers. Using a coloring book designed to teach very young children about their rights, the teachers hoped to shift the children’s focus from individual wants to community needs – to increase levels of cooperation, altruism, and empathy.

==Evaluations of children’s human rights education==
The earliest reported evaluation of a child rights education project was that of the initiative in Bruges.&lt;ref name=belgium /&gt; Involving children ages 3 to 12, the primary focus of the evaluation was on the students’ social behavior. Gains in social understanding, respectful behaviors, concern for others, and pro-social action were the key observed changes. For example, the children became more interested in social justice and rights-related issues such as peace, war, injustice, and hunger. And they wanted to discuss the rights of marginalized children – those living with disabilities, in institutions, and of ethnic minority status.

Similar outcomes were found in evaluations of the effects of children’s rights education in Cape Breton schools. Evaluations conducted on students in grades 6 and 8 (ages 12 and 14 years) showed improved [[classroom climate]], engagement, and behavior.&lt;ref name=impact /&gt;&lt;ref name=moral /&gt; At the grade 6 level differences were found in children’s understanding of rights, their acceptance of minority children, and their perceived levels of peer and teacher support. Teachers reported improved behavior and more positive classroom climate. In addition at the grade 8 level, children in rights-based classes showed increases in their self-esteem. Similar child-initiated projects to those reported from Bruges were seen also.  For example, at one school upon realizing that not every child in the area was assured their right to nutritious food, the students initiated a breakfast program by obtaining cooperation and donations from the local community. In a different school, the class decided to work at a local [[food bank]] to help children whose families were unable to provide sufficient nutritious food.

Anecdotal data from the teachers who used the grade 12 curriculum described how engaged their students were in the activities, and noted improvements in their students’ appreciation of global problems, and of the complexity and importance of respecting human rights. Students who had participated in the project completed a survey. The results showed them to be three times more likely than their peers to understand humanitarian assistance for children in difficult circumstances as a fundamental human right.

The most comprehensive evaluation data are of the Hampshire RRR initiative.&lt;ref name=dead /&gt;&lt;ref name=comp6&gt;Covell, K., McNeil, J.K, and  Howe, R.B. (2009).

''Cambridge Journal of Education,'' 40 (1), 39-51.&lt;/ref&gt; Annual assessments over six years were conducted to assess the effects of the RRR. Included were children ages 4 – 14. Children and teachers in schools where RRR had been fully implemented were compared with those in demographically equivalent schools without RRR.  These comparisons showed the following effects of RRR. Across ages, children showed a greater understanding of rights and their relation to responsibilities, increased levels of self-regulation, confidence, effort and motivation, participation and engagement in school, and achievement. These cognitive and attitudinal changes were reflected in significant improvements in behaviors. Children were reported by both their classroom teachers and the school principal to be more respectful, cooperative, inclusive and sensitive to the needs of other children. Incidents of bullying were reduced dramatically with disagreements being resolved using the discourse of rights rather than through physical or verbal aggression.

Teaching in RRR schools also led to changes in the teachers. School administrators noted significant changes in teachers use of democratic teaching and positive classroom management, and in less confrontational dealings with their students. Teachers were listening to children and taking their views into account. And the greater the level of student engagement and participation, the more teachers showed gains in a sense of personal achievement and significant decreases in emotional exhaustion and depersonalization.

Among all the positive findings of the evaluation of the RRR, the most intriguing was that at each time of measure the most disadvantaged school showed the greatest positive changes.&lt;ref name=comp2 /&gt; Improvements in engagement, behavior and academic achievement were remarkable, and have been attributed to how the RRR transformed the culture of the school. The evidence suggests that schools that are fully consistent with the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child can mediate the effects of a challenging environment of rearing and help close the achievement gap between disadvantaged children and their more advantaged peers.&lt;ref name=educate /&gt;

==Other evaluations==
Although no formal evaluation has yet been published on the New Zealand initiative, anecdotal evidence suggests the outcomes are comparable to those reported from Hampshire.&lt;ref name=hrie /&gt; Teachers report improved learning environments and decreased stress.  "Makes me think critically about some of the things I do in my classroom", a teacher reported, "especially some of the aspects of my behavior management." Another stressed that she has "had fabulous response from the children."

Evaluation data from Pamela Wallberg and Maria Kahn show that their preschool rights project was highly successful.&lt;ref name=wallberg /&gt; They found that teaching young children about their Convention rights in an age-appropriate way transformed the learning environment. As classroom rules were replaced with rights, less adult control was needed and group conversations changed from chaotic chatter to the respectful exchange of ideas. The children’s behavior toward each other changed markedly. Their interactions reflected an understanding of the universality of rights and the importance of protecting the rights of others. And even at this very young age, rights discourse replaced arguing; for example, "you are hurting my right to play" became an effective problem solver that replaced tears and fighting. Wallberg and Kahn conclude that the children’s recognition of the relationship between rights and responsibilities shifted their focus "from 'me' to 'we'."

The directionality of the relationship between sound and movement is not always fixed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Choreomusicology&lt;/ref&gt; Choreomusicologists hold that studying the variable relationships between sound and movement in diverse performance arts can provide insight into perceptual sensibilities, cultural processes, and interpersonal dynamics.

'''Chorography''' (from [[wikt:χῶρος|χῶρος]] ''khōros'', "place" and [[wikt:γράφω|γράφειν]] ''graphein'', "to write") is the art of describing or mapping a region or district,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Chorography|volume=6|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by extension such a description or map.&lt;ref name=Merriam-Webster&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chorography Merriam-Webster]&lt;/ref&gt; This term derives from the writings of the ancient geographer [[Pomponius Mela]] and  [[Ptolemy]], where it meant the geographical description of regions. However, its resonances of meaning have varied at different times. Richard Helgerson states that "chorography defines itself by opposition to [[chronicle]]. It is the genre devoted to place, and chronicle is the genre devoted to time".&lt;ref&gt;Helgerson 1992, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Darrell Rohl prefers a broad definition of "the representation of space or place".&lt;ref&gt;Rohl 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ptolemy 16century.jpg|thumb|Ptolemy as imagined by a 16th-century artist]]

==Ptolemy's definition==
In his text of the ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' (2nd century CE), Ptolemy defined [[geography]] as the study of the entire world, but chorography as the study of its smaller parts—provinces, regions, cities, or ports. Its goal was "an impression of a part, as when one makes an image of just an ear or an eye"; and it dealt with "the qualities rather than the quantities of the things that it sets down". Ptolemy implied that it was a ''graphic'' technique, comprising the making of views (not simply maps), since he claimed that it required the skills of a draftsman or landscape artist, rather than the more technical skills of recording "proportional placements". Ptolemy's most recent English translators, however, render the term as "regional cartography".&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Berggren and Alexander Jones (eds), ''Ptolemy's Geography'' (Princeton, 2000), pp. 57-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaissance revival==
Ptolemy's text was rediscovered in the west at the beginning of the fifteenth century, and the term "chorography" was revived by [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] scholars.&lt;ref&gt;See Lucia Nuti, 'Mapping Places: Chorography and Vision in the Renaissance', in Denis Cosgrove (ed.), ''Mappings'' (London, 1999), pp. 90-108.&lt;/ref&gt; An early instance is a small-scale map of [[Great Britain|Britain]] in an early fifteenth-century manuscript, which is labelled a ''tabula chorographica''.&lt;ref&gt;British Library Harleian MS 1808, fol. 9v; reproduced in Catherine Delano-Smith and R.J.P Kain, ''English Maps: a History'' (London, 1999), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dee]] in 1570 regarded the practice as "an underling, and a twig of ''Geographie''", by which the "plat" [plan or drawing] of a particular place would be exhibited to the eye.&lt;ref&gt;John Dee, 'Mathematicall Praeface', in Euclid, ''The Elements of Geometrie'', trans. H. Billingsley (London, 1570), sig. A4r.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Camden by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger.jpg|thumb|left|upright|William Camden]]
The term also came to be used, however, for ''written'' descriptions of regions.  These regions were extensively visited by the writer, who then combined local topographical description, summaries of the historical sources, and local knowledge and stories, into a text. The most influential example (at least in Britain) was probably [[William Camden]]'s ''Britannia'' (first edition 1586), which described itself on its title page as a ''Chorographica descriptio''. [[William Harrison (priest)|William Harrison]] in 1587 similarly described his own "Description of Britaine" as an exercise in chorography, distinguishing it from the historical/chronological text of Holinshed's [[Holinshed's Chronicles|''Chronicles'']] (to which the "Description" formed an introductory section).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William |last=Harrison |authorlink=William Harrison (priest) |chapter=An Historicall Description of the Iland of Britaine |editor-first=Raphael |editor-last=Holinshed |editor-link=Raphael Holinshed |title=The First and Second Volumes of Chronicles |edition=2nd |place=London |year=1587 |page=sig. [A2]v |url=http://english.nsms.ox.ac.uk/holinshed/texts.php?text1=1587_0002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Heylin]] in 1652 defined chorography as "the exact description of some Kingdom, Countrey, or particular Province of the same", and gave as examples [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]'s ''Description of Greece'' (2nd century AD); Camden's ''Britannia'' (1586); [[Lodovico Guicciardini]]'s ''Descrittione di  tutti i Paesi Bassi'' (1567) (on the [[Low Countries]]); and [[Leandro Alberti]]'s ''Descrizione d'Italia'' (1550).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Heylyn |authorlink=Peter Heylin |title=Cosmographie |location=London |year=1652 |page=27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camden's ''Britannia'' was predominantly concerned with the history and antiquities of Britain, and, probably as a result, the term chorography in English came to be particularly associated with [[antiquarian]] texts. [[William Lambarde]], [[John Stow]], [[John Hooker (English constitutionalist)|John Hooker]], [[Michael Drayton]], [[Tristram Risdon]], [[John Aubrey]] and many others used it in this way, arising from a gentlemanly [[topophilia]] and a sense of service to one's county or city, until it was eventually often applied to the genre of [[English county histories|county history]]. A late example was William Grey's ''Chorographia'' (1649), a survey of the antiquities of the city of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. Even before Camden's work appeared, [[Andrew Melville]] in 1574 had referred to chorography and [[chronology]] as the "twa lights" [two lights] of [[history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=G. R. |editor-last=Kinloch |editor-link=George Ritchie Kinloch |title=The Diary of Mr James Melvill, 1556–1601 |publisher=Bannatyne Club |location=Edinburgh |year=1829 |pages=38–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Saxton pamberforest.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Example of [[Christopher Saxton]]'s cartography]]
However, the term also continued to be used for maps and map-making, particularly of sub-national or [[Counties of England|county]] areas. William Camden praised the county mapmakers [[Christopher Saxton]] and [[John Norden]] as "most skilfull Chorographers";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William |last=Camden |translator-first=Philemon |translator-last=Holland |translator-link=Philemon Holland |title=Britain, or a Chorographicall Description of the most flourishing Kingdomes, England, Scotland, and Ireland, and the Ilands adjoyning, out of the depth of Antiquitie |chapter=The Author to the Reader |place=London |year=1610 |page=sig. [*5]v |url=http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/cambrit/fronteng.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert Plot]] in 1677&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Plot |authorlink=Robert Plot |title=The Natural History of Oxford-shire |location=Oxford |year=1677 |page=299 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Christopher Packe (physician and cartographer)|Christopher Packe]] in 1743&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Christopher |last=Packe |authorlink=Christopher Packe (physician and cartographer) |title=A New Philosophico-Chorographical Chart of East-Kent |location=[Canterbury] |year=1743 }}&lt;/ref&gt; both referred to their county maps as chorographies.

By the beginning of the eighteenth century the term had largely fallen out of use in all these contexts, being superseded for most purposes by either "[[topography]]" or "[[cartography]]". [[Samuel Johnson]] in his ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language|Dictionary]]'' (1755) made a distinction between geography, chorography and topography, arguing that geography dealt with large areas, topography with small areas, but chorography with intermediary areas, being "less in its object than geography, and greater than topography".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Samuel |last=Johnson |authorlink=Samuel Johnson |title=A Dictionary of the English Language |location=London |year=1755 |chapter=chorography |page=373 |url=https://johnsonsdictionaryonline.com/page-view/?i=373 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, however, the term is only rarely found in English by this date.

[[File:Ferdinand von Richthofen.jpg|thumb|upright|Ferdinand von Richthofen]]

==Modern usages==
In more technical geographical literature, the term had been abandoned as city views and [[city map]]s became more and more sophisticated and demanded a set of skills that required not only skilled draftsmanship but also some knowledge of scientific [[surveying]]. However, its use was revived for a second time in the late nineteenth century by the geographer [[Ferdinand von Richthofen]]. He regarded chorography as a specialization within geography, comprising the description through field observation of the particular traits of a given area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valpo.edu/geomet/geo/courses/geo466/topics/germany.html GEO 466/566: The Profession of Geography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211150811/http://www.valpo.edu/geomet/geo/courses/geo466/topics/germany.html |date=2012-02-11 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also now widely used by historians and literary scholars to refer to the [[Early modern period|early modern]] genre of topographical and antiquarian literature.&lt;ref&gt;Particularly influential in reviving the term has been Helgerson 1992, esp. pp. 105-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[history of art|Art historians]] and [[philosophy of art|philosophers of art]] have long had '''classificatory disputes about art''' regarding whether a particular cultural form or piece of work should be classified as [[art]]. Disputes about what does and does not count as art continue to occur today.&lt;ref&gt;Semiotics of the Media By [[Winfried Nöth]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=2Zk_Meiva7MC&amp;pg=PA621&amp;lpg=PA621&amp;dq=%22fine+art%22+%22art+objects%22+semiotics&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Syp47RdWZg&amp;sig=D-Tio3vfK-UkLs2s2DJzHHGCoDk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions of art==
[[File:Wanluan Thatched Hall by Dong Qichang.jpg|thumb|230px|left|[[Dong Qichang]], ''Landscape'' 1597. Dong Qichang was a high-ranking [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] civil servant, painting imaginary landscapes in the Chinese tradition of [[literati painting]], with collector's seals and poems.]]
Defining art can be difficult. [[Aesthetics|Aestheticians]] and art philosophers often engage in disputes about how to define art. By its original and broadest definition, '''''art''''' (from the [[Latin]] ''ars'', meaning "skill" or "[[craft]]") is the product or process of the effective application of a body of knowledge, most often using a set of skills; this meaning is preserved in such phrases as "[[liberal arts]]" and "[[martial arts]]". However, in the modern use of the word, which rose to prominence after 1750, “art” is commonly understood to be skill used to produce an [[aesthetic]] result (Hatcher, 1999).

Britannica Online defines it as "the use of skill or imagination in the creation of aesthetic objects, environments, or experiences that can be shared with others".&lt;ref&gt;Britannica Online&lt;/ref&gt; But how best to define the term “art” today is a subject of much contention; many books and journal articles have been published arguing over even the basics of what we mean by the term “art” (Davies, 1991 and Carroll, 2000). [[Theodor Adorno]] claimed in 1969 “It is self-evident that nothing concerning art is self-evident any more.” It is not clear who has the right to define art. Artists, philosophers, anthropologists, and psychologists all use the notion of art in their respective fields, and give it operational definitions that are not very similar to each other's.

The second, more narrow, more recent sense of the word “art” is roughly as an abbreviation for '''''creative art''''' or “[[fine art]].” Here we mean that skill is being used to express the artist’s creativity, or to engage the audience’s aesthetic sensibilities. Often, if the skill is being used to create objects with a practical use, rather than paintings or sculpture with no practical function other than as an [[Work of art|artwork]], it will be considered it as falling under classifications such as the [[decorative arts]], [[applied art]] and [[craft]] rather than fine art. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it will be considered [[design]] instead of art. Some thinkers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference (Novitz, 1992). The modern distinction does not work well for older periods, such as [[medieval art]], where the most highly regarded art media at the time were often [[metalwork]], [[engraved gems]], [[textiles]] and other "applied arts", and the perceived value of artworks often reflected the cost of the materials and sheer amount of time spent creating the work at least as much as the creative input of the artist.

==Theories of art classification==
===Historical systematic classifications===
In the [[Zhou dynasty]] of ancient China, excellence in the ''liù yì'' (六藝), or "[[Six Arts]]", was expected of the ''junzi'' (君子), or "perfect gentleman", as defined by philosophers like [[Confucius]]. Because these arts spanned both the [[Civil service#China|civil]] and [[Military history of China before 1911|military]] aspects of life, excelling in all six required a scholar to be very well-rounded and [[polymath]]ic. The Six Arts were as follows:

* [[Confucianism#Rite and centring|Rites]] (禮)
* [[Music of China|Music]] (樂)
* [[Archery]] (射)
* [[Chariot]]eering and [[equestrianism]] (御)
* [[Chinese calligraphy|Calligraphy]] (書)
* [[Chinese mathematics|Mathematics]] (數) 

Later in the history of imperial China, the Six Arts were pared down, creating a similar system of [[Four Arts]] for the [[scholar-official]] [[caste]] to learn and follow:

* ''[[Guqin|Qín]]'' (琴), an instrument representing music
* ''[[Go (game)|Qí]]'' (棋), a board game representing military strategy

* ''Huà'' (畫), or [[Chinese painting]], representing the visual arts

Another attempt to systematically define art as a grouping of disciplines in antiquity is represented by the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[Muses]]. Each of the standard nine Muses symbolized and embodied one of nine branches of what the Greeks called ''[[techne]]'', a term which roughly means "art" but has also been translated as "craft" or "craftsmanship", and the definition of the word also included more scientific disciplines. These nine traditional branches were:
* [[Epic poetry]], embodied by [[Calliope]]
* [[History]], embodied by [[Clio]]
* [[Music]] and [[lyric poetry]], embodied by [[Euterpe]]
* [[Love poetry]], embodied by [[Erato]]
* [[Tragedy]], embodied by [[Melpomene]]
* [[Hymns]] and [[pantomime]], embodied by [[Polyhymnia]]
* [[Dance]] and [[Greek chorus|chorus]], embodied by [[Terpsichore]]
* [[Comedy]] and [[idyll|idyllic poetry]], embodied by [[Thalia (Muse)|Thalia]]
* [[Astronomy]], embodied by [[Urania]]

In [[Christendom#Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages|medieval Christian Europe]], [[Medieval university|universities]] taught a standard set of seven [[liberal arts]], defined by early medieval philosophers such as [[Boethius]] and [[Alcuin|Alcuin of York]] and as such centered around philosophy. The definitions of these subjects and their practice was heavily based on the educational system of Greece and Rome. These seven arts were themselves split into two categories:
* the [[Trivium]], considered the foundation of knowledge, and comprising the three basic elements of philosophy: [[grammar]], [[logic]], and [[rhetoric]];
* and the [[Quadrivium]], comprising [[music]], [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]] and [[astronomy]].

At this time, and continuing after the [[Renaissance]], the word "art" in English and its cognates in other languages had not yet attained their modern meaning. One of the first philosophers to discuss art in the framework we understand today was [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], who described in his ''[[Lectures on Aesthetics]]'' a ranking of the five major arts from most material to most expressive:
#[[architecture]]
#[[sculpture]]
#[[painting]]
#[[music]]
#[[poetry]]

Hegel's listing of the arts caught on particularly in France, and with continual modifications the list has remained relevant and a subject of debate in French culture into the 21st century. This classification was popularized by [[Ricciotto Canudo]], an early scholar of film who wrote "Manifesto of the Seventh Art" in 1923. The epithets given to each discipline by its placement of the list are often used to refer to them through paraphrase, particularly with calling film "the seventh art". The French [[Ministry of Culture (France)|Ministry of Culture]] often participates in the decision making for defining a "new" art.&lt;ref&gt;Crampton, Thomas. [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/06/business/worldbusiness/06game.html "For France, Video Games Are as Artful as Cinema"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The ten arts are generally given as follows:
#''le premier art:'' [[architecture]]
#''le deuxième art:'' [[sculpture]]
#''le troisième art:'' [[painting]]
#''le quatrième art:'' [[music]]
#''le cinquième art:'' [[literature]], including [[poetry]] and [[prose]]
#''le sixième art:'' the [[performing arts]], including [[dance]] and [[theatre]]
#''le septième art:'' film and cinema
#''le huitième art: "les arts médiatiques",'' including [[radio]], [[television]], and [[photography]]
#''le neuvième art:'' [[comics]]
#''le dixième art:'' [[video games]], or digital art forms more generally&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090106154034/http://big-presse.com/big-article-Art-1707.php "Connaissez-vous le 10eme art ? L'art numérique."], 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ongoing dispute over what should constitute the next form of art has been fought for over a century. Currently, there are a variety of contenders for ''le onzième art'', many of which are older disciplines whose practitioners feel that their medium is underappreciated as art. One particularly popular contender for the 11th is [[multimedia]], which is intended to bring together the ten arts just as Canudo argued that cinema was the culmination of the first six arts. [[Performance art]], as separate from the performing arts, has been called ''le douzième'', or "twelfth", art.&lt;ref&gt;Mas, Jean. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MreyR7VhSh0 ''Manifeste de la Performance''], AICA-France/Villa Arson, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generalized definitions of art===
The traditional Western classifications since the Renaissance have been variants of the [[hierarchy of genres]] based on the degree to which the work displays the imaginative input of the artist, using artistic theory that goes back to the ancient world. Such thinking received something of a boost with the [[aesthetics]] of [[Romanticism]]. A similar theoretical framework applied in traditional [[Chinese art]]; for example in both the Western and Far Eastern traditions of [[landscape painting]] (see [[literati painting]]), ''imaginary'' landscapes were accorded a higher status than realistic depictions of an actual landscape view - in the West relegated to "[[topographical view]]s".

Many have argued that it is a mistake to even try to define art or beauty, that they have no essence, and so can have no definition. Often, it is said that art is a cluster of related concepts rather than a single concept. Examples of this approach include Morris Weitz and Berys Gaut.

[[Image:Andy Warhol 1977.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Andy Warhol]] exhibited wooden sculptures of [[Brillo|Brillo Boxes]] as art.]]
Another approach is to say that “art” is basically a sociological category, that whatever art schools and museums, and artists get away with is considered art regardless of formal definitions. This [[institutional theory of art]] has been championed by [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]]. Most people did not consider a store-bought [[urinal (restroom)|urinal]] or a sculptural depiction of a [[Brillo|Brillo Box]] to be art until [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Andy Warhol]] (respectively) placed them in the context of art (i.e., the [[art gallery]]), which then provided the association of these objects with the values that define art.

Proceduralists often suggest that it is the process by which a work of art is created or viewed that makes it, art, not any inherent feature of an object, or how well received it is by the institutions of the art world after its introduction to society at large. For [[John Dewey]], for instance, if the writer intended a piece to be a poem, it is one whether other poets acknowledge it or not. Whereas if exactly the same set of words was written by a journalist, intending them as shorthand notes to help him write a longer article later, these would not be a poem.

[[Leo Tolstoy]], on the other hand, claims that what makes something art or not is how it is experienced by its audience, not by the intention of its creator.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Functionalists, like [[Monroe Beardsley]] argue that whether a piece counts as art depends on what function it plays in a particular context. For instance, the same Greek vase may play a non-artistic function in one context (carrying wine), and an artistic function in another context (helping us to appreciate the beauty of the human figure).

==Disputes about classifying art==
Philosopher David Novitz has argued that disagreements about the definition of art are rarely the heart of the problem, rather that “the passionate concerns and interests that humans vest in their social life” are “so much a part of all classificatory disputes about art” (Novitz, 1996). According to Novitz, classificatory disputes are more often disputes about our values and where we are trying to go with our society than they are about theory proper. For example, when the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' criticized [[Damien Hirst]] and [[Tracey Emin]]’s work by arguing "For 1,000 years art has been one of our great civilising forces. Today, pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all" they are not advancing a definition or theory about art, but questioning the value of Hirst’s and Emin’s work.

On the other hand, [[Thierry de Duve]]&lt;ref&gt;Thierry de Duve, ''Kant After Duchamp''. 1996&lt;/ref&gt; argues that disputes about the definition of art are a necessary consequence of [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s presentation of a [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymade]] as a work of art. In his 1996 book ''Kant After Duchamp'' he reinterprets Kant's ''[[Critique of Judgement]]'' exchanging the phrase "this is beautiful" with "this is art", using Kantian aesthetics to address post-Duchampian art.

===Conceptual art===
{{main article|Conceptual art}}

The work of the French artist [[Marcel Duchamp]] from the 1910s and 1920s paved the way for the conceptualists, providing them with examples of prototypically conceptual works (the [[readymade]]s, for instance) that defied previous categorisations. Conceptual art emerged as a movement during the 1960s. The first wave of the "conceptual art" movement extended from approximately 1967 to 1978. Early "concept" artists like [[Henry Flynt]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]] and [[Ray Johnson]] influenced the later, widely accepted movement of conceptual artists like [[Dan Graham]], [[Hans Haacke]], and [[Douglas Huebler]].

More recently, the “[[Young British Artists]]” (YBAs), led by [[Damien Hirst]], came to prominence in the 1990s and their work is seen as conceptual, even though it relies very heavily on the art object to make its impact. The term is used in relation to them on the basis that the object is not the artwork, or is often a [[Found art|found object]], which has not needed artistic skill in its production. [[Tracey Emin]] is seen as a leading YBA and a conceptual artist, even though she has denied that she is and has emphasised personal emotional expression.

====Recent examples of disputed conceptual art====
1991: [[Charles Saatchi]] funds Damien Hirst and the next year in the [[Saatchi Gallery]] exhibits his ''[[The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living]]'', a shark in formaldehyde in a vitrine.

1993: [[Vanessa Beecroft]] holds her first performance in Milan, Italy, using young girls to act as a second audience to the display of her diary of food.

1999: [[Tracey Emin]] is nominated for the [[Turner Prize]]. Part of her exhibit is ''My Bed'', her dishevelled bed, surrounded by detritus such as condoms, blood-stained knickers, bottles and her bedroom slippers.

2001: [[Martin Creed]] wins the Turner Prize for ''The Lights Going On and Off'', an empty room where the lights go on and off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/1698032.stm BBC Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Controversy in the UK====
[[Image:Stuckist International Gallery 2003 (shark 1).jpg|thumb|''A Dead Shark Isn't Art'', [[Stuckism International Gallery]], 2003]]
The [[Stuckism|Stuckist]] group of artists, founded in 1999, proclaimed themselves "pro-contemporary figurative painting with ideas and anti-conceptual art, mainly because of its lack of concepts." They also called it pretentious, "unremarkable and boring" and on July 25, 2002, in a [[Stuckist demonstrations|demonstration]], deposited a coffin outside the [[White Cube]] gallery, marked "The Death of Conceptual Art".&lt;ref&gt;Cripps, Charlotte.

Retrieved 25 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the [[Stuckism International Gallery]] exhibited a preserved shark under the title ''A Dead Shark Isn't Art'', clearly referencing the Damien Hirst work (see disputes above).&lt;ref&gt;Alberge, Dalya.

In a BBC2 ''[[Newsnight]]'' programme on 19 October 1999 hosted by [[Jeremy Paxman]] with Charles Thomson attacking that year's Turner Prize and artist [[Brad Lochore]] defending it, Thomson was displaying Stuckist paintings, while Lochore had brought along a plastic detergent bottle on a cardboard plinth. At one stage Lochore states, "if people say it's art, it's art". Paxman asks, "So you can say anything is art?" and Lochore replies, "You could say everything is art..." At this point Thomson, off-screen, can be heard to say, "Is my shoe art?" while at the same time his shoe appears in front of Lochore, who observes, "If you say it is. I have to judge it on those terms." Thomson's response is, "I've never heard anything so ludicrous in my life before."&lt;ref&gt;Milner, Frank, ed. ''[[The Stuckists Punk Victorian]]'', pp.32-48, [[National Museums Liverpool]] 2004, {{ISBN|1-902700-27-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[Ivan Massow]], the Chairman of the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] branded conceptual art "pretentious, self-indulgent, craftless tat" and in "danger of disappearing up its own arse ... led by cultural tsars such as the [[Tate Gallery|Tate]]'s Sir [[Nicholas Serota]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,634797,00.html ''The Guardian'']&lt;/ref&gt; Massow was consequently forced to resign. At the end of the year, the Culture Minister, [[Kim Howells]], an art school graduate, denounced the Turner Prize as "cold, mechanical, conceptual bullshit".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3585205/The-entries-are-tat.-Theyre-made-badly.-Theyre-just-very-boring-and-very-thin.html ''The Daily Telegraph'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2004, the [[Saatchi Gallery]] told the media that "painting continues to be the most relevant and vital way that artists choose to communicate."&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Nigel 2004 [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1473165/Saatchi%27s-latest-shock-for-the-art-world-is---painting.html "Saatchi's latest shock for the art world is &amp;ndash; painting"] ''The Daily Telegraph'' 10 February 2004. Accessed April 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, [[Charles Saatchi]] began to sell prominent works from his YBA ([[Young British Artists]]) collection.

===Computer and video games===
{{main article|Video games as an art form}}
Computer games date back as far as 1947, although they did not reach much of an audience until the 1970s. It would be difficult and odd to deny that computer and video games include many kinds of art (bearing in mind, of course, that the concept "art" itself is, as indicated, open to a variety of definitions). The graphics of a video game constitute [[digital art]], [[graphic art]], and probably [[video art]]; the original soundtrack of a video game clearly constitutes [[music]]. However it is a point of debate whether the video game as a whole should be considered a piece of art of some kind, perhaps a form of [[interactive art]].

Film critic [[Roger Ebert]], for example, has gone on record claiming that video games are not art, and for structural reasons will always be inferior to cinema, but then, he admits his lack of knowledge in the area when he affirmed that he "will never play a game when there is a good book to be read or a good movie to be watched.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=ANSWERMAN&amp;date=20051127 |work=Chicago Sun-Times |title=Why did the chicken cross the genders? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619125645/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=answerman&amp;date=20051127 |archivedate=2010-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Video game designer [[Hideo Kojima]] has argued that playing a videogame is not art, but games do have artistic style and incorporate art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=2006 |title= Official PlayStation Magazine (US) |journal= |volume= Feb 2006 |issue= |pages= |publisher= |doi= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/150043/kojima-says-games-are-not-art |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017050011/http://kotaku.com/150043/kojima-says-games-are-not-art |archivedate=2012-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120723020624/http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=6350406 A videogame is not art!]&lt;/ref&gt; Video game designer Chris Crawford argues that video games are art.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Crawford, ''The Art of Computer Game Design'' 1982 mirrored with permission at [http://www.vancouver.wsu.edu/fac/peabody/game-book/Coverpage.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
Esquire columnist Chuck Klosterman also argues that video games are art.&lt;ref&gt;Chuck Klosterman “The Lester Bangs of Video Games” ''Esquire'' July 2006 at [http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/news/a797/esq0706kloster-66/]&lt;/ref&gt; Tadhg Kelly argues that play itself is not art and that fun is a constant required for all games &lt;ref&gt;[http://whatgamesare.com/2011/09/fun-simple-to-explain-hard-to-accept.html Tadhg Kelly, ''Fun: Simple to Explain, Hard to Accept'', 2011, at]&lt;/ref&gt; so the art in games is the art of location and place rather than interaction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whatgamesare.com/2011/11/living-galleries-games-are-art.html Tadhg Kelly, ''Living Galleries'', 2011 at]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28130">'''Cognitive musicology''' is a branch of [[cognitive science]] concerned with [[Cognitive model#Computational models|computationally modeling]] musical knowledge with the goal of understanding both music and cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Laske | first = Otto | title = Navigating New Musical Horizons (Contributions to the Study of Music and Dance) | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-313-30632-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive musicology can be differentiated from other branches of [[music psychology]] via its methodological emphasis, using computer modeling to study music-related [[knowledge representation]] with roots in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[cognitive science]]. The use of computer models provides an exacting, interactive medium in which to formulate and test theories.&lt;ref&gt;Laske, O. (1999). AI and music: A cornerstone of cognitive musicology. In M. Balaban, K. Ebcioglu, &amp; O. Laske (Eds.), ''Understanding music with AI: Perspectives on music cognition.'' Cambridge: The [[MIT Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

This interdisciplinary field investigates topics such as the parallels between language and music in the brain. Biologically inspired models of computation are often included in research, such as neural networks and evolutionary programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Graci | first1 = C | year = 2009 | title = A brief tour of the learning sciences featuring a cognitive tool for investigating melodic phenomena | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Technology Systems | volume = 38 | issue = 2| pages = 181–211 | doi=10.2190/et.38.2.i}}&lt;/ref&gt; This field seeks to model how musical knowledge is represented, stored, perceived, performed, and generated. By using a well-structured computer environment, the systematic structures of these cognitive phenomena can be investigated.&lt;ref&gt;Hamman, M., 1999. "Structure as Performance: Cognitive Musicology and the Objectification of Procedure," in  Otto Laske: Navigating New Musical Horizons, ed. J. Tabor. New York: Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even while enjoying the simplest of melodies there are multiple brain processes that are synchronizing to comprehend what is going on. After the stimulus enters and undergoes the processes of the ear, it enters the auditory cortex, part of the temporal lobe, which begins processing the sound by assessing its pitch and volume. From here, brain functioning differs amongst the analysis of different aspects of music. For instance, the rhythm is processed and regulated by the left frontal cortex, the left parietal cortex and the right cerebellum standardly. Tonality, the building of musical structure around a central chord, is assessed by the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum (Abram, 2015). Music is able to access many different brain functions that play an integral role in other higher brain functions such as motor control, memory, language, reading and emotion. Research has shown that music can be used as an alternative method to access these functions that may be unavailable through non-musical stimulus due to a disorder. Musicology explores the use of music and how it can provide alternative transmission routes for information processing in the brain for diseases such as Parkinson's and [[dyslexia]] as well.

==Notable researchers==
The polymath [[H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins|Christopher Longuet-Higgins]], who coined the term "cognitive science", is one of the pioneers of cognitive musicology.  Among other things, he is noted for the computational implementation of an early key-finding algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;Longuet-Higgins, C. (1987) Mental Processes: Studies in cognitive science. Cambridge, MA, US: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Key finding is an essential element of tonal music, and the key-finding problem has attracted considerable attention in the psychology of music over the past several decades.  Carol Krumhansl and Mark Schmuckler proposed an empirically grounded key-finding algorithm which bears their names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Krumhansl | first = Carol | title = Cognitive Foundations of Musical Pitch | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford Oxfordshire | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-19-505475-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their approach is based on key-profiles which were painstakingly determined by what has come to be known as the probe-tone technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Krumhansl | first1 = C. | last2 = Kessler | first2 = E. | year = 1982 | title = Tracing the dynamic changes in perceived tonal organisation in a spatial representation of musical keys | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 89 | issue = | pages = 334–368 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.89.4.334}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This algorithm has successfully been able to model the perception of musical key in short excerpts of music, as well as to track listeners' changing sense of key movement throughout an entire piece of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmuckler | first1 = M. A. | last2 = Tomovski | first2 = R. | year = 2005 | title = Perceptual tests of musical key-finding | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 1124–1149 | doi=10.1037/0096-1523.31.5.1124}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Temperley, whose early work within the field of cognitive musicology applied dynamic programming to aspects of music cognition, has suggested a number of refinements to the Krumhansl-Schmuckler Key-Finding Algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Temperley | first = David | title = The Cognition of Basic Musical Structures | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-262-20134-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Otto Laske was a champion of cognitive musicology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Laske | first = Otto | title = Otto Laske | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-313-30632-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A collection of papers that he co-edited served to heighten the visibility of cognitive musicology and to strengthen its association with AI and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Balaban | first = Mira | title = Understanding Music with AI | publisher = AAAI Press | year = 1992 | location = Menlo Park | isbn = 0-262-52170-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The foreword of this book reprints a free-wheeling interview with [[Marvin Minsky]], one of the founding fathers of AI, in which he discusses some of his early writings on music and the mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Minsky | first1 = M | year = 1981 | title = Music, mind, and meaning | url = http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/papers/MusicMindMeaning.html | journal = Computer Music Journal | volume = 5 | issue = 3| pages = 28–44 | doi=10.2307/3679983}}&lt;/ref&gt; AI researcher turned cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter has also contributed a number of ideas pertaining to music from an AI perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hofstadter | first = Douglas | title = Gödel, Escher, Bach | publisher = Basic Books | location = New York | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-465-02656-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Musician Steve Larson, who worked for a time in Hofstadter's lab, formulated a theory of "musical forces" derived by analogy with physical forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Larson | first1 = S | year = 2004 | title = Musical Forces and Melodic Expectations: Comparing Computer Models with Experimental Results | doi = 10.1525/mp.2004.21.4.457 | journal = Music Perception | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 457–498 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hofstadter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cope | first = David | title = Virtual Music | publisher = The MIT Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-262-53261-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also weighed in on David Cope's experiments in musical intelligence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cope | first = David | title = Experiments in Musical Intelligence | publisher = A-R Editions | location = Madison | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-89579-337-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which take the form of a computer program called EMI which produces music in the form of, say, Bach, or Chopin, or Cope.

Cope's programs are written in [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], which turns out to be a popular language for research in cognitive musicology.  Desain and Honing have exploited Lisp in their efforts to tap the potential of microworld methodology in cognitive musicology research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Honing | first1 = H | year = 1993 | title = A microworld approach to formalizing musical knowledge | url = | journal = Computers and the Humanities | volume = 27 | issue = 1| pages = 41–47 | doi=10.1007/bf01830716}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also working in Lisp, Heinrich Taube has explored computer composition from a wide variety of perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Taube | first = Heinrich | title = Notes from the Metalevel | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-90-265-1975-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are, of course, researchers who chose to use languages other than Lisp for their research into the computational modeling of musical processes.  Tim Rowe, for example, explores "machine musicianship" through C++ programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rowe | first = Robert | title = Machine Musicianship | publisher = MIT Pr | location = City | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-262-68149-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A rather different computational methodology for researching musical phenomena is the toolkit approach advocated by David Huron.&lt;ref&gt;Huron, D. (2002). Music Information Processing Using the Humdrum Toolkit: Concepts, Examples, and Lessons. "Computer Music Journal, 26" (2), 11–26.&lt;/ref&gt;  At a higher level of abstraction, Gerraint Wiggins has investigated general properties of music knowledge representations such as structural generality and expressive completeness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wiggins | first1 = G. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 1993 | title = A Framework for the Evaluation of Music Representation Systems | url = | journal = Computer Music Journal | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 31–42 | doi=10.2307/3680941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a great deal of cognitive musicology research features symbolic computation, notable contributions have been made from the biologically inspired computational paradigms.  For example, [[Jamshed Bharucha]] and Peter Todd have modeled music perception in tonal music with neural networks.&lt;ref&gt;Bharucha, J. J., &amp; Todd, P. M. (1989). Modeling the perception of tonal structure with neural nets. ''Computer Music Journal'', 44−53&lt;/ref&gt;  Al Biles has applied genetic algorithms to the composition of jazz solos.&lt;ref&gt;Biles, J. A. 1994. "GenJam: A Genetic Algorithm for Generating Jazz Solos." Proceedings of the 1994 International Computer Music Conference. San Francisco: International Computer Music Association&lt;/ref&gt;  Numerous researchers have explored algorithmic composition grounded in a wide range of mathematical formalisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Nierhaus | first = Gerhard | title = Algorithmic Composition | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-3-211-75539-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cope | first = David | title = Computer Models of Musical Creativity | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-262-03338-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within [[cognitive psychology]], among the most prominent researchers is [[Diana Deutsch]], who has engaged in a wide variety of work ranging from studies of absolute pitch and musical illusions to the formulation of musical knowledge representations to relationships between music and language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Deutsch | first = Diana | title = The Psychology of Music | publisher = Academic Press | location = Boston | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-12-213565-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Equally important is Aniruddh D. Patel, whose work combines traditional methodologies of cognitive psychology with [[neuroscience]].  Patel is also the author of a comprehensive survey of cognitive science research on music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Patel | first = Aniruddh | title =Music, Language, and the Brain | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-12-213565-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most significant contribution to viewing music from a linguistic perspective is the [[Generative Theory of Tonal Music]] (GTTM) proposed by [[Fred Lerdahl]] and [[Ray Jackendoff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lerdahl | first = Fred |author2=Ray Jackendoff | title = A Generative Theory of Tonal Music | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-262-62107-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although GTTM is presented at the algorithmic level of abstraction rather than the implementational level, their ideas have found computational manifestations in a number of computational projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Katz|first=Jonah|author2=David Pesetsky|title=The Recursive Syntax and Prosody of Tonal Music|journal=Recursion: Structural Complexity in Language and Cognition|date=May 2009|volume=Conference at UMass Amherst|url=http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/people/faculty/pesetsky/Katz_Pesetsky_Recursion_Conference_Music.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamanaka|first=Masatoshi|author2=Hirata, Keiji |author3=Tojo, Satoshi |title=Implementing 'A Generative Theory of Tonal Music'|journal=Journal of New Music Research|date=2006|volume=35|issue=4|pages=249–277|doi=10.1080/09298210701563238}}&lt;!--|accessdate=21 May 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

For the German-speaking area, Laske's conception of cognitive musicology has been advanced by Uwe Seifert in his book ''Systematische Musiktheorie und Kognitionswissenschaft. Zur Grundlegung der kognitiven Musikwissenschaft'' ("Systematic music theory and cognitive science. The foundation of cognitive musicology")&lt;ref&gt;Uwe Seifert: ''Systematische Musiktheorie und Kognitionswissenschaft. Zur Grundlegung der kognitiven Musikwissenschaft''. Orpheus Verlag für systematische Musikwissenschaft, Bonn 1993&lt;/ref&gt;  and  subsequent publications.

== Music and language acquisition skills ==
Both music and speech rely on sound processing and require interpretation of several sound features such as timbre, pitch, duration, and their interactions (Elzbieta, 2015). A fMRI study revealed that the Broca's and Wernicke's areas, two areas that are known to activated during speech and language processing, were found activated while the subject was listening to unexpected musical chords (Elzbieta, 2015). This relation between language and music may explain why, it has been found that exposure to music has produced an acceleration in the development of behaviors related to the acquisition of language. The Suzuki music education which is very widely known, emphasizes learning music by ear over reading musical notation and preferably begins with formal lessons between the ages of 3 and 5 years. One fundamental reasoning in favor of this education points to a parallelism between natural speech acquisition and purely auditory based musical training as opposed to musical training due to visual cues. There is evidence that children who take music classes have obtained skills to help them in language acquisition and learning (Oechslin, 2015), an ability that relies heavily on the dorsal pathway. Other studies show an overall enhancement of verbal intelligence in children taking music classes. Since both activities tap into several integrated brain functions and have shared brain pathways it is understandable why strength in music acquisition might also correlate with strength in language acquisition.

== Music and pre-natal development ==
Extensive prenatal exposure to a melody has been shown to induce neural representations that last for several months. In a study done by Partanen in 2013, mothers in the learning group listened to the ‘Twinkle twinkle little star' melody 5 times per week during their last trimester. After birth and again at the age of 4 months, they played the infants in the control and learning group a modified melody in which some of the notes were changed. Both at birth and at the age of 4 months, infants in the ''learning group'' had stronger event related potentials to the unchanged notes than the ''control group''. Since listening to music at a young age can already map out neural representations that are lasting, exposure to music could help strengthen brain plasticity in areas of the brain that are involved in language and speech processing.

== Music therapy effect on cognitive disorders ==
If neural pathways can be stimulated with entertainment there is a higher chance that it will be more easily accessible. This illustrates why music is so powerful and can be used in such a myriad of different therapies. Music that is enjoyable to a person illicit an interesting response that we are all aware of. Listening to music is not perceived as a chore because it is enjoyable, however our brain is still learning and utilizing the same brain functions as it would when speaking or acquiring language. Music has the capability to be a very productive form of therapy mostly because it is stimulating, entertaining, and appears rewarding. Using fMRI, Menon and Levitin found for the first time that listening to music strongly modulates activity in a network of mesolimbic structures involved in reward processing. This included the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), as well as the hypothalamus, and insula, which are all thought to be involved in regulating autonomic and physiological responses to rewarding and emotional stimuli (Gold, 2013).

Pitch perception was positively correlated with phonemic awareness and reading abilities in children (Flaugnacco, 2014). Likewise, the ability to tap to a rhythmic beat correlated with performance on reading and attention tests (Flaugnacco, 2014). These are only a fraction of the studies that have linked reading skills with rhythmic perception, which is shown in a meta-analysis of 25 cross-sectional studies that found a significant association between music training and reading skills (Butzlaff, 2000). Since the correlation is so extensive it is natural that researchers have tried to see if music could serve as an alternative pathway to strengthen reading abilities in people with developmental disorders such as dyslexia. Dyslexia is a disorder characterized by a long lasting difficulty in reading acquisition, specifically text decoding. Reading results have been shown to be slow and inaccurate, despite adequate intelligence and instruction. The difficulties have been shown to stem from a phonological core deficit that impacts reading comprehension, memory and prediction abilities (Flaugnacco, 2014). It was shown that music training modified reading and phonological abilities even when these skills are severely impaired. By improving temporal processing and rhythm abilities, through training, phonological awareness and reading skills in children with dyslexia were improved. The OPERA hypothesis proposed by Patel (2011), states that since music places higher demands on the process than speech it bring brings adaptive brain plasticity of the same neural network involved in language processing.

Parkinson's disease is a complex neurological disorder that negatively impacts both motor and non-motor functions caused by the degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (Ashoori, 2015). This in turn leads to a DA deficiency in the basal ganglia. The deficiencies of dopamine in these areas of the brain have shown to cause symptoms such as tremors at rest, rigidity, akinesia, and postural instability. They are also associated with impairments of internal timing of an individual (Ashoori, 2015). Rhythm is a powerful sensory cue that has shown to help regulate motor timing and coordination when there is a deficient internal timing system in the brain. Some studies have shown that musically cued gait training significantly improves multiple deficits of Parkinsons, including in gait, motor timing, and perceptual timing. Ashoori's study consisted of 15 non-demented patients with idiopathic Parkinson's who had no prior musical training and maintained their dopamine therapy during the trials. There were three 30-min training sessions per week for 1 month where the participants walked to the beats of German folk music without explicit instructions to synchronize their footsteps to the beat. Compared to pre-training gait performance, the Parkinson's patients showed significant improvement in gait velocity and stride length during the training sessions. The gait improvement was sustained for 1 month after training, which indicates a lasting therapeutic effect. Even though this was uncued it shows how the gait of these Parkinson's patients was automatically synchronized with the rhythm of the music. Also the lasting therapeutic effect shows that this might have affected the internal timing of the individual in a way that could not be accessed by other means.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4640">The term '''Context art''' ({{lang-de|Kontext Kunst}}) was introduced through the seminal exhibition and an accompanying publication ''Kontext Kunst. The Art of the 90s''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neuegalerie-archiv.at/93/kunst/cover.html Neue Galerie im Künstlerhaus Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; curated by [[Peter Weibel]] at the Neue Galerie im Künstlerhaus Graz (Austria) in 1993 (02.10.–07.11.1993).

== Exhibition and publication ==

Both exhibition and publication aimed to establish grounds for recognizing a new form of artistic practice emerging in the early 1990s. The presentation displayed different approaches though all shared an interest in the use of methods of contextualization to reveal connections between the art works and their conditions of production, whether these were formal, social, or ideologically defined. Institutional critique, feminist positions, later also critiques of precarious economic conditions and issues of globalization, all closely related to social and political changes, became relevant subjects of artistic production.

“It is no longer purely about critiquing the art system, but about critiquing reality and analyzing and creating social processes. In the ’90s, non-art contexts are being increasingly drawn into the art discourse. Artists are becoming autonomous agents of social processes, partisans of the real. The interaction between artists and social situations, between art and non-art contexts has led to a new art form, where both are folded together: Context art. The aim of this social construction of art is to take part in the social construction of reality.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shiftyparadigms.org/false_economies.htm Peter Weibel, Kontextkunst – Kunst der 90er Jahre (Köln: DuMont Verlag, 1994), p. 57, translated by Barnaby Drabble / resource: Rebecca Gordon Nesbitt, ''False Economies: Time to Take Stock'' ]&lt;/ref&gt;  

It might be due to the fact that the term was introduced under the German translation ''[[KontextKunst]]'' instead of ''Context Art'' or its likewise politically tended orientation (see Maria Lind’s reference&lt;ref&gt;[http://eipcp.net/transversal/1204/lind/en/#_ftn16 Actualisation of Space: The Case of Oda Projesi]''Kontextkunst'' is, if you wish a German parallel to the so-called 'relational aesthetics' but more programmatically political and academic. Both imply a more dynamic notion of art, which actively takes the context into consideration and which often goes beyond the exhibition space. Some of the artists used as 'good' examples by Christian Kravagna have been associated with Kontextkunst. See Peter Weibel: ''Kontextkunst – Kunst der 90er Jahre'', Cologne, DuMont Verlag 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;), but it never spread far beyond Europe’s language based barriers. Instead vaguely similar strategies were labeled as ''Models of Participatory Practice''&lt;ref&gt;[http://republicart.net/disc/aap/kravagna01_en.htm Working on the Community Models of Participatory Practice]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1998 by Christian Kravagna’s attempt to define the field or the later appearing and quite moderate [[Relational Art]] based on the 2002 book ''[[Relational Aesthetics]]'' by [[Nicolas Bourriaud]].  

The accompanying catalog is described to document ”a wide-ranging exhibition designed to illustrate the emergence over the past decade of a new international art movement, .. “ featuring “… an anthology of 22 substantial essays (some reprinted) discussing from diverse perspectives the artistic issues and social and political themes that distinguish ''Context Art'' from related forms of conceptual and installation art…. “.

In The [[United States]] [[criminal justice system]], a '''Courtroom Workgroup''' is an informal arrangement between a criminal [[prosecutor]], [[criminal defense attorney]], and the [[judicial officer]]. This foundational concept in the academic discipline of [[criminal justice]] recharacterizes the seemingly adversarial courtroom participants as collaborators in "doing justice." The courtroom workgroup was proposed by Eisenstein and Jacob in 1977 to explain their observations of the ways courts, especially lower level courts, actually come to decisions.

Because the courtroom workgroup deviates from the public consensus of how justice works, it has developed a deviant set of rules to continue its work and facilitate daily life for its participants. The academic theory of the courtroom workgroup has four cornerstone concepts that recognize this fact: Speed, Pragmatic Cynicism, Collegiality, and Secrecy. Efficient courtroom workgroups seek to process cases rather than dispense justice. This has been confirmed to greater and lesser extents in different courts.  [[Defendant]]s are assumed to be guilty. The procedural merits of the case are the true determinative factors of an outcome. Prosecutors and defense attorneys engage in a comparison of charges against possible procedural flaws and possible defenses to arrive at the going rate for a crime.  These factors are used to determine how much punishment the plea bargain will offer.  For example, group relationships and the desire to "maintain" a healthy working relationship are important to group members. The workings of the courtroom group and the "going rate" for given crimes are not matters for public disclosure. Estimates can be given to clients, but usually couched in terms of the prosecution's willingness to negotiate. (Summarized by O'Connor, T.R., 2005)

The courtroom workgroup is a mechanism for [[prosecutorial discretion]].  Various techniques are used to convince the defendant that the evidence against him or her is overwhelming.  “Charge stacking” is a process by which police and prosecutors create a case with numerous charges or numerous instances of the same charge to convince the defendant that the risk of not pleading guilty is intolerable.  The defendant may be convinced to plead guilty to a few of the charges in return for not being prosecuted for the remaining charges.

The courtroom workgroup is, in some sense, a response to a lack of resources for public defenders.  Defense attorneys in public defender offices often do not have sufficient time to prepare a case in detail for all of their clients.  Further, they often do not have the budget to fully investigate the facts of a case through either staff or private investigators.  They often must rely solely on police reports for such information.  In some jurisdictions, clients do not meet their attorneys until they are in court.  Typically, public defenders will meet briefly with clients in holding facilities or jails.  The defense attorney defends his or her client by seeking less punishment.  Huemann (1977) indicates that many defense attorneys feel pressured to keep up with their caseloads.  This pressure can manifest in the courtroom through rebukes by the judge for delays.  Many subtle pressures combine to encourage participation in the courtroom workgroup.

The concept of a courtroom workgroup is associated with plea bargaining. The courtroom workgroup shows remarkable explanatory power in overburdened courts dealing with large caseloads.  The courtroom workgroup model is best suited to explain jurisdictions where defense attorneys are more or less permanently assigned, but even occasionally appointed lawyers can participate in these practices. While many of the higher level prosecutions still follow the adversarial model, there is evidence that lower-level proceedings follow the courtroom workgroup model. Boland, Brady, Tyson, &amp; Bassler (1983) indicate that approximately 90 percent of criminal cases are settled by plea bargain. This figure appears to be stable over the last twenty years (Rainville &amp; Reaves, 2003). Some collaborative efforts on the part of the courtroom workgroup simply must be present to facilitate this high percentage of pleas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17541">'''Drug education''' is the planned provision of information, resources, and skills relevant to living in a world where [[drugs|psychoactive substances]] are widely available and commonly used for a variety of both medical and non-medical purposes, some of which may lead to harms such as [[drug overdose|overdose]], [[injury]], infectious [[disease]] (such as [[HIV]] or [[hepatitis C]]), or [[substance dependence|addiction]].

==Benefits==
Planning includes developing strategies for helping children and young people engage with relevant drug-related issues during opportunistic and brief contacts with them as well as during more structured sessions.  Drug education enables children, youth and adults to develop the knowledge, skills and attitudes to appreciate the benefits of living healthily (which may or may not include the use of psychoactive substances), promote responsibility towards the use of drugs and relate these to their own actions and those of others, both now and in their future lives. It also provides opportunities for people to reflect on their own and others' attitudes to various psychoactive substances, their use and the people who use them.

==Drug education campaigns &amp; programs==
Drug education can be given in numerous forms, some more effective than others. Examples include [[advertising]] and awareness raising campaigns such as the UK Government’s [[FRANK (drugs)|FRANK]] campaign or the US "media campaign".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediacampaign.org/ Media campaign]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition there are school based drug education programs like [[Drug Abuse Resistance Education|DARE]] or that currently being evaluated by the UK Blueprint Programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drugs.gov.uk/young-people/blueprint Blueprint], ''Home office.gov''&lt;/ref&gt; In efforts to prevent problematic substance use, drug education may perpetuate myths and stereotypes about psychoactive substances and people who use them.&lt;ref name=Tupper&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tupper|first=Kenneth|title=Drugs, discourses and education: A critical discourse analysis of a high school drug education text|journal=Discourse: Studies in the Cultural Politics of Education|year=2008|volume=29|issue=2|pages=223–238|doi=10.1080/01596300801966864}}&lt;!--|accessdate=December 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Drug education can also take less explicit forms; an example of this is the Positive Futures Programme, funded by the UK government as part of its drug strategy. This programme uses [[sport]] and the [[arts]] as catalysts to engage young people on their own turf, putting them in contact with positive role models (coaches/trained youth workers). After building a trusting relationship with a young person, these role models can gradually change attitudes towards drug use and steer the young person back into education, [[training]] and [[employment]]. This approach reaches young people who have dropped out of mainstream education. It also has additional benefits for the community in reduced [[crime]] and [[anti-social behaviour]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drugs.gov.uk/publication-search/young-people/0607_YPSMPG11 Positive Futures Programme]&lt;/ref&gt;

==School-based drug education ==
School-based drug education began with the anti-alcohol "[[temperance (virtue)|temperance]] education" programmes of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] in the United States and Canada in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=Beck&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beck|first=Jerome|title=100 years of 'just say no' versus 'just say know': Reevaluating drug education goals for the coming century|journal=Evaluation Review|year=1998|volume=22|issue=1|pages=15–45|doi=10.1177/0193841x9802200102}}&lt;!--|accessdate=December 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In many respects, the WCTU's [[progressive education]] agenda set the template for much of what has been done since in the name of drug education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tupper|first=Kenneth|title=Sex, Drugs and the Honour Roll: The Perennial Challenges of Addressing Moral Purity Issues in Schools|journal=Critical Public Health|year=2013|volume=24|issue=2|pages=115–131|doi=10.1080/09581596.2013.862517}}&lt;!--|accessdate=December 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Past research into drug education has indicated that to be effective it must involve engaging, interactive learning strategies that stimulate higher-order thinking, promote learning and be transferable to real life circumstances. Current challenges from this approach exist in adopting evidence-based school drug education programmes.&lt;ref name=Cahil&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cahil|first=H. W.|title=Challenges in adopting evidence-based school drug education programmes|journal=Drug &amp; Alcohol Review|year=2007|volume=26|issue=6|pages=673–679|doi=10.1080/09595230701613593}}&lt;!--|accessdate=26 June 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, in the majority of countries where preventive drug education programs and courses exist, they are established and funded by the Government. These education programs aim to educate adolescents about [[Recreational drug use|illicit drug use]] in an effort to prevent illegal drug use while highlighting the dangers of [[substance abuse|problematic substance use]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Midford|first=R|title=Is Australia ‘fair dinkum’ about drug education in schools?|journal=Drug &amp; Alcohol Review|year=2007|volume=26|issue=4|pages=421–427|doi=10.1080/09595230701373842}}&lt;!--|accessdate=26 June 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian Government]] has implemented a range of drug education programs through the [[National Drug Education Strategy (NDES)]] by providing schools with effective drug education programmes. The program aims  to manage drug related issues and incidents within schools .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Schools Drug Education Strategy 2009|url=http://www.education.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/2203/NationalDrugEducationStrategy.pdf|work=Northern Territory Government|publisher=Department of Education and Children Services|accessdate=26 June 2013|year=2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421035758/http://www.education.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/2203/NationalDrugEducationStrategy.pdf|archivedate=21 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 December 2015 the [http://www.health.gov.au/ Australian Government Department of Health] launched the [http://www.positivechoices.org.au Positive Choices] portal as part of its response to the findings from the National Ice Taskforce report.&lt;ref&gt;Grass roots a key to tackling ice https://www.health.gov.au/internet/ministers/publishing.nsf/Content/health-mediarel-yr2015-nash053.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prime Minister of Australia, JOINT DOORSTOP INTERVIEW, SYDNEY https://www.pm.gov.au/media/2015-12-06/joint-doorstop-interview-sydney&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.positivechoices.org.au Positive Choices] is an online portal that facilitates access to interactive evidence-based drug education resources and prevention programs for school communities. [http://www.positivechoices.org.au Positive Choices] builds on existing drug education resources developed by researchers at the [https://ndarc.med.unsw.edu.au/ National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre (NDARC)] such as the [https://www.climateschools.com.au/ Climate Schools programs] that have been proven to reduce alcohol and drug related harms and increase student well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Champion|title=A cross-validation trial of an Internet-based prevention program for alcohol and cannabis: Preliminary results from a cluster randomised controlled trial|journal=Aust NZ J Psychiatry|date=2015|volume=50|pages=64–73|doi=10.1177/0004867415577435|url=http://anp.sagepub.com/content/50/1/64|accessdate=2 February 2016|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newton, N.|title=Internet-based prevention for alcohol and cannabis use: final results of the Climate Schools course|journal=Addiction|date=2010|volume=105|issue=4|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02853.x/full|accessdate=2 February 2016|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02853.x|pages=749–759}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newton, N.|title=Delivering prevention for alcohol and cannabis using the internet: A cluster randomised controlled trial|journal=Preventive Medicine|date=2009|volume=48|issue=6|pages=579–584|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743509002072|accessdate=2 February 2016|ref=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743509002072|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2009.04.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian Department of Health and Aging]] identified that analgesics (90%), alcohol (80-90%) and tobacco (30-60%) were the most widely utilised substances among adolescents. In addition to this, cannabis was another commonly used illicit substance that accounted for 33% usage among adolescents aged 14–17 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stanton|first=B|title=School drug education in New South Wales: Moral panic and the individualisation youth drug use|journal=Social Alternatives|year=2005|volume=24|issue=4|pages=50–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to government funded programs, a number of not-for-profit organisations (such as [[Life Education Australia]] also provide drug education programs to adolescents. These preventative programs aim to deliver a progressive approach that will motivate and encourage young people to make positive decisions in life. Emphasis within these programs is also placed in focusing on deterring [[peer pressure]] as a means of empowering adolescents and promoting autonomy. This approach reaches 750,000 primary and secondary students in Australia each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Joyce|first=R|author2=O’Connor, L.|title=Life Education: Research and Evaluation.|journal=Life Education|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== D.A.R.E, Drug Abuse Resistance Education ==
D.A.R.E stands for Drug Abuse Resistance Education. In the United States, D.A.R.E is implemented in elementary school classrooms, 5th grade to educate students on drugs effects and temptations they may encounter. The program implemented in public and private school systems to prepare 5th graders for middle school, as well as all further education.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dukes|first=Richard L.|last2=Stein|first2=Judith A.|date=August 1997|title=Long-Term Impact of Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE)|url=|journal=Evaluation Review|volume=21.4|pages=483|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;Although D.A.R.E is implemented to prevent students from doing drugs in the future, there is little evidence to suggest it actually prevents students from doing drugs. In the article, “Long-Term Impact of Drug Abuse Resistance Education” by Dukes and Stein, a [[chi-squared test]] was performed to see if there was a significant difference between high school students that received D.A.R.E training and those who did not receive D.A.R.E and its relation to drug use. The study found that there is no significant difference between the drug use of students that received D.A.R.E and students that did not. One of the main reasons the authors mentioned D.A.R.E had little correlation with Drug use is that there are other external causes that only affect some students, which can lead them into the direction of drug use. Additionally, the time that students received D.A.R.E (5th grade), and the time that the students encounter drugs may be many years after, so students may have little remembrance of the program. However, the United States schools continue to implement the program in classrooms because the police officers that come into classrooms can serve as community role models to students, and all students are different so it may steer them away from drugs in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dukes|first=Richard L.|last2=Stein|first2=Judith A.|date=August 1997|title=Long-Term Impact of Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE)|url=|journal=Evaluation Review|volume=21.4|pages=483|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Steroid use in high schools ==
Steroid use is a common form of drug use in high schools across the United States. Many students, specifically males, use steroids to increase their performance in athletic events. Many professional athletes, for example professional cyclist, Lance Armstrong, and former professional MLB player, Alex Rodriguez both were nationally recognized as steroid users. Additionally in an article in the ''Journal of Molecular &amp; Cellular Endocrinology,'' it states that in a survey of  212 Canadian national track athletes, over 10% of them would take an illegal drug if it was undetectable, if it could help them win an Olympic gold medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anawalt|first=Bradley D.|date=March 2018|title=Detection of Anabolic Androgenic Steroid Use by Elite Athletes and by Members of the General Public|url=|journal=Molecular &amp; Cellular Endocrinology|volume=464|pages=21-27|via=EBSCOhost, doi:10.1016/j.mce.2017.09.027}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many adolescents idolize athletes, so when they find out there is a way to enhance their performance, and that elite athletes are using them, steroids may be used by students. 

An article in the ''Journal of Child &amp; Adolescent Substance Abuse'' ran a study on two southern California high schools in middle class suburbs, and the high school students use of Anabolic Androgenic Steroids. It surveyed students on if they use steroids, knew the side effects of steroids, and additionally their use of other prevalent drugs. The article specifically found that male students that were athletes were more likely to use steroids than students that are female or non- athlete students in general. Most students that participated in steroids played the sports, football or soccer, and were most likely to do steroids if they participated in both sports. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lorang|first=Melissa|date=September 2011|title=Anabolic Androgenic Steroid Use in Teens: Prevalence, Demographics, and Perception of Effects|url=|journal=Journal of Child &amp; Adolescent Substance Abuse|volume=20|pages=358–369|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;Professional sports, influence young athletes, and when pro- athletes participate in drugs, it can lead young adults to use drugs without realizing the side effects and consequences that come along with drug use.

Also, a study in the ''journal of Drugs: Education, Prevention &amp; Policy'' discusses alcohol and drug prevention programs in Australia for students in grades 8 and 9. It goes into detail about the student's between 13 and 15 years old, to see if alcohol and drug prevention programs have an actual effect on preventing substance abuse. The study comes to conclusion that when the students went through a drug and alcohol prevention program, they were less likely to develop a drug or alcohol problem. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Midford|first=Richard|last2=et al.|date=April 2012|title=Alcohol Prevention: What Can Be Expected of a Harm Reduction? Focused School Drug Education Program?|url=|journal=Drugs: Education, Prevention &amp; Policy|volume=19, no. 2|pages=102-110|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology and Drug Education ==
The University of North Carolina Greensboro has researched the drug prevention program, All Stars, Sr.,. The program is developing education through technology (videos), so that health education programs could reach schools in rural communities. The technology programs would provide drug/ health education in general with qualified instructors, in areas that do not have programs. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wyrick|first=David L|last2=et. al|date=July 2010|title=Going the Distance: Delivery of High School Drug Prevention via Distance Education|url=|journal=American Journal of Distance Education|volume=24.3|pages=151-162|via=EBSCOhost,}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation ==
Recent studies have identified that a gap between the theory of education programmes and the implementation exists.&lt;ref name=Cahil/&gt; This is regards to the collaborative learning approach and difficulties with teachers adopting these interactive drug education programmes. The practical implications of these findings are that professional training and support are required to increase the effectiveness of teaching staff, and the uniform implementation of drug curriculum.&lt;ref name=Cahil/&gt; Additional drug education research in the future should acknowledge the complexities of implementing these programmes in a school environment. Furthermore, additional support for teachers, counselors, school administrators and other education professionals should be integrated as a means of being realistic about what constitutes effective drug education and maintaining a high quality standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tupper|first=Kenneth|title=Teaching teachers to just say 'know': Reflections on drug education|journal=Teaching and Teacher Education|year=2008|volume=24|issue=2|pages=356–367|doi=10.1016/j.tate.2007.08.007}}&lt;!--|accessdate=December 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology and hypotheses==
===Issues with research===
Within the field of pornography research, there are many challenges that arise due to strong opinions and feelings on the topic. [[Confirmation bias]] is prevalent due to societal taboos surrounding pornography. While many studies hypothesize about and study negative effects of pornography, few researchers explore potential benefits or positive aspects of pornography. A large percentage of studies suffer from [[methodological]] issues. In one meta-study by researchers at Middlesex University in England, over 40,000 papers and articles were submitted to the team for review and 276 or 0.69% were suitable for consideration due to the low quality of research within the field.&lt;ref name="middlesexstudy"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22987051|title=Do we know whether pornography harms people?|last=Fidgen|first=Jo|date=2013-06-25|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zillmann's research===
[[File:Zillmann Fig 5.png|thumb|300px|Figure 5 in ''Effects of Prolonged Consumption of Pornography.''&lt;ref name="prolonged"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/NN/B/C/K/V/ |last=Zillmann |first=Dolf |title=Effects of Prolonged Consumption of Pornography |website=National Institutes of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;]][[File:Zillmann Fig 10.png|thumb|300px|Figure 10 in ''Effects of Prolonged Consumption of Pornography.''&lt;ref name="prolonged"/&gt;]]

In ''Effects of Prolonged Consumption of Pornography'', a review of pornography research conducted for the [[Surgeon General of the United States]] in 1986, Zillmann noted that inconsistencies in the literature on pornography exist, but overall concluded that extensive viewing of pornographic material may produce some [[sociology|sociological]] effects he argued were negative, including a decreased respect for long-term, [[monogamy|monogamous]] relationships, and an attenuated desire for [[reproduction|procreation]].&lt;ref name="prolonged"/&gt; He describes the hypothetical basis for these conclusions stating:&lt;blockquote&gt;The values expressed in pornography clash so obviously with the family concept, and they potentially undermine the traditional values that favor marriage, family, and children ... Pornographic scripts dwell on sexual engagements of parties who have just met, who are in no way attached or committed to each other, and who will part shortly, never to meet again ... Sexual gratification in pornography is not a function of emotional attachment, of kindness, of caring, and especially not of continuance of the relationship, as such continuance would translate into responsibilities, curtailments, and costs ...&lt;ref&gt;Zillmann, pages 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other contemporary researchers disagreed, McKay &amp; Dolf noting "neglected in work on pornography is that adults capable of functioning in contemporary society are also quite able to distinguish the difference between reality and fantasy. That such a point requires stating is indicative of the overly simplistic model of human behaviour which is reflected in this type of work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McKay|first1=H.B.|last2=Dolff|first2=D.J|title='The Impact of Pornography: An Analysis of Research and Summary of Findings';  Working Papers on Pornography and Prostitution Report No. 3|date=1984|publisher=Department of Justice, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects as [[Gail Dines]] summarizes Zillman's 1989 study, include "alters perceptions of sexuality; specifically, it fosters presumptions of popularity for less common sexual practices; breeds discontent with the physical appearance and the sexual performance of intimate partners; trivializes rape as a criminal offense and also trivializes sexual child abuse as a criminal offense; and promotes insensitivity toward victims of sexual violence and promotes men's beliefs that they would be capable of committing rape. In addition, habitual male consumers of common pornography appear to be at greater risk of becoming sexually callous and sexually violent toward women than occasional users."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dines|first1=Gail|title=Pornland : how porn has hijacked our sexuality|date=2010|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|isbn=0807044520}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Bryant|editor-first1=D. Zillmann, J.|title=Pornography : research advances and policy considerations|date=1989|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Hillsdale (New Jersey)|isbn=0805806156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Avedon Carol]] has explained of Zillmann's term "sexually callous" that he meant "a greater tolerance for homosexuality; a belief that women should be able to choose other priorities beside motherhood; less belief in marriage; a belief that women may enjoy sex and choose to participate in it for reasons other than pleasing their husbands or conceiving children - in short, the goals of most feminist groups of the time. Zillmann was unable to demonstrate any increase in misogynist or violent attitudes and desires, although he did try." and stated of the sponsor of the report "Having noted the varied interpretability of Zillmann and Bryant's findings, the [USA] Surgeon-General's report said that the only reliable findings of the research that supposedly proved men were more callous towards women after looking at pornography was this: the group that saw pornography estimated more accurately the prevalence of sexual practices in society. The control group, which did not see the material, tended to underestimate grossly how common certain sexual acts were" and commented "But even this result may be less reliable than it appears, due to methodological problems. Zillmann and Bryant had tried to include non-students in their research, but many of them left the study group when they discovered they would be asked to look at pornography. This meant that the control group contained a different population - older, perhaps more settled married men, for example - and thus any differences in the answers the groups gave to the questions might only reflect different attitudes among the different groups, and not pornography effects at all. The study was no longer controlled. In the end, the research may only mean that older, married men are less critical of their partners than young, single psychology students, and that such young, educated men have more liberal attitudes about women's roles and homosexuality, and more realistic knowledge of sexual practices in society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carol|first1=Avedon|title=Nudes, Prudes and Attitudes: Pornography and Censorship|date=1994|publisher=New Clarion Press|location=Gloucester|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Addiction==
[[Pornography addiction]] is a purported [[behavioral addiction]] characterized by [[compulsive]], repeated use of pornographic material until it causes serious negative consequences to one's physical, mental, social, and/or financial well-being.&lt;ref name="dsm-5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SteinHollander2009"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Dan J. |last1=Stein |first2=Eric |last2=Hollander |first3=Barbara Olasov |last3=Rothbaum |title=Textbook of Anxiety Disorders |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=quQY1R8vsZcC&amp;pg=PA359 |accessdate=24 April 2010 |date=31 August 2009 |publisher=American Psychiatric Pub |isbn=978-1-58562-254-2|pages=359–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17503551"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Parashar A, Varma A |title=Behavior and substance addictions: is the world ready for a new category in the DSM-V? |journal=CNS Spectr |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=257; author reply 258–9 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17503551 |doi= |url=http://www.cnsspectrums.com/aspx/articledetail.aspx?articleid=1035}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no diagnosis of pornography addiction in the current ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' ([[DSM-5]]).&lt;ref name="dsm-5" /&gt; The DSM-5 considered the diagnosis of hypersexuality-related behavioral disorders (to which porn addiction was a subset), but rejected it because "there is insufficient peer-reviewed evidence to establish the diagnostic criteria and course descriptions needed to identify these behaviors as mental disorders."&lt;ref name="dsm-5"&gt;{{Cite book|author=American Psychiatric Association|year=2013|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders| edition=Fifth|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|location=Arlington, VA|pages=481, 797–798|isbn=978-0-89042-555-8|quote=Thus, groups of repetitive behaviors, which some term behavioral addictions, with such subcategories as "sex addiction," "exercise addiction," or "shopping addiction," are not included because at this time there is insufficient peer-reviewed evidence to establish the diagnostic criteria and course descriptions needed to identify these behaviors as mental disorders.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, some psychologists suggest that any [[maladaptive]] sexual symptoms represent a manifestation of an underlying disorder, such as depression or anxiety which is simply manifesting itself sexually, or, alternatively, there is no underlying disorder and the behavior simply is not maladaptive. These psychologists do not recognize the concept of addiction, only chemical dependence, and believe the concept and diagnosis to be stigmatizing and unhelpful.&lt;ref&gt;The British Psychological Society, "Response to the American Psychiatric Association: DSM-5 Development", 2001 [http://apps.bps.org.uk/_publicationfiles/consultation-responses/DSM-5%202011%20-%20BPS%20response.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YlBQ8G56X7YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Myth+of+addiction+ley&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjU7sqG85nPAhVU2WMKHUMBB_cQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Myth%2520of%2520addiction%2520ley&amp;f=false|title=The Myth of Sex Addiction|last=Ley|first=David J.|date=2014-07-10|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9781442213050|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two 2016 neurology reviews found evidence of addiction related brain changes in internet pornography users. Psychological effects of these brain changes are described as desensitization to reward, a dysfunctional anxiety response, and impulsiveness.&lt;ref name=Kraus2016rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuhn2016rev/&gt; Another 2016 review suggests that internet behaviors, including the use of pornography, be considered potentially addictive, and that problematic use of online pornography be considered an "internet-use disorder".&lt;ref name=Brand2016rev/&gt;

===Controlled studies===
{{See also|Correlation does not imply causation}}
A controlled study describes the relationship between given behaviors or environmental conditions and health effects in a laboratory setting in which conditions other than those under study are effectively held constant across groups of participants receiving various levels of the experimental condition(s).  Since it is considered that the only functional difference between groups is the level of experimental condition(s) received, researchers can strongly infer cause-and-effect relationships from [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] associations between experimental condition(s) and health consequences.  Thus, if executed properly, controlled studies have high levels of [[internal validity]].  However, such studies often suffer from questionable [[external validity]] due to the considerable differences between real-world environments and the experimental context, and the consequent belief that results cannot be generalized beyond that context.&lt;ref name=psychtextbooks/&gt;

The link between pornography and sexual aggression has been the subject of multiple [[Meta-analysis|meta-analyses]].&lt;ref name="g"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/malamuth/pdf/00arsr11.pdf |format=PDF |title=Pornography and Attitudes Supporting Violence Against Women: Revisiting the Relationship in Nonexperimental Studies |first=Gert Martin |last=Hald |first2=Neil |last2=Malamuth |first3=Carlin |last3=Yuen |year=2000 |website=UCLA Division of Social Sciences |accessdate=13 March 2013}}

A meta-analysis conducted in 2015 found that pornography "consumption was associated with sexual aggression in the United States and internationally, among males and females, and in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Associations were stronger for verbal than physical sexual aggression, although both were significant. The general pattern of results suggested that violent content may be an exacerbating factor."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Meta-Analysis of Pornography Consumption and Actual Acts of Sexual Aggression in General Population Studies|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcom.12201/abstract|journal = Journal of Communication|date = 2015-12-01|issn = 1460-2466|pages = 183–205|doi = 10.1111/jcom.12201|language = en|first = Paul J.|last = Wright|first2 = Robert S.|last2 = Tokunaga|first3 = Ashley|last3 = Kraus|volume=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|date=July 2016}}

In an earlier review of this literature Ferguson and Hartley (2009) argued that "it is time to discard the hypothesis that pornography contributes to increased sexual assault behavior".&lt;ref name="Ferguson &amp; Hartley (2009)"&gt;{{citation |last=Ferguson|first=Christopher J.|title=The pleasure is momentary...the expense damnable?  The influence of pornography on rape and sexual assault.|url=http://www.christopherjferguson.com/pornography.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; They stated that the authors of some studies tended to highlight positive findings while deemphasizing null findings, demonstrating confirmation bias in the published literature.  Ferguson and Hartley concluded that controlled studies, on balance, were not able to support links between pornography and sexual violence.

===Epidemiological studies===
An [[epidemiological]] study describes the association between given behaviors or environmental conditions, and physical or psychological health by means of observation of real-world phenomena through statistical data.  Epidemiological studies generally have high levels of [[external validity]], insofar as they accurately describe events as they occur outside of a laboratory setting, but low levels of [[internal validity]], since they do not strongly establish cause-and-effect relationships between the behaviors or conditions under study, and the health consequences observed.&lt;ref name=psychtextbooks&gt;*Mitchell, M. and Jolley, J.

Danish criminologist [[Berl Kutchinsky]]'s ''Studies on Pornography and sex crimes in Denmark'' (1970), a scientific report ordered by the Presidential Commission on Obscenity and Pornography, found that the legalizing of pornography in [[Denmark]] had not resulted in an increase of [[sex crimes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://home20.inet.tele.dk/gorzelak/dps/anmeldelser/barbano_kutchinsky.html [[Berl Kutchinsky]]: ''Studies on Pornography and sex crimes in Denmark''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030030642/http://home20.inet.tele.dk/gorzelak/dps/anmeldelser/barbano_kutchinsky.html |date=2007-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, many other experiments have been conducted, either supporting or opposing the findings of [[Berl Kutchinsky]], who would continue his study into the social effects of pornography until his death in 1995. His life's work was summed up in the publication ''Law, Pornography, and Crime: The Danish Experience'' (1999). Milton Diamond from the [[University of Hawaii]] found that the number of reported cases of child sex abuse dropped markedly immediately after the ban on sexually explicit materials was lifted in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/BIB/DIAM/effects_pornography.htm The Effects of Pornography: An International Perspective] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203171037/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/BIB/DIAM/effects_pornography.htm |date=2012-02-03 }} [[University of Hawaii]] Porn 101: Eroticism, Pornography, and the First Amendment: Milton Diamond Ph.D.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, a review of epidemiological studies by Neil M. Malamuth found that the quantity of pornographic material viewed by men was positively correlated with degree to which they endorsed sexual assault.&lt;ref name="Malamuth"&gt;{{cite book|last=Malamuth|first=Neil M.|title=Do Sexually Violent Media Indirectly Contribute to Antisocial Behavior?|publisher=Public Health Service of United States|date=August 4, 1986|pages=38|url=http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/NN/B/C/K/W/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malamuth's work describes Check (1984), who found among a diverse sample of [[Canadians|Canadian]] men that more exposure to pornography led to higher acceptance of [[rape myth]]s, violence against women, and general sexual callousness. In another study, Briere, Corne, Runtz and Neil M. Malamuth, (1984) reported similar correlations in a sample involving college males. On the other hand, the failure to find a statistically significant correlation in another previous study led Malamuth to examine other interesting correlations, which took into account the information about [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] the samples obtained in their childhood, and pornography emerged as the second most important source of information.&lt;ref name="Malamuth" /&gt;  Malamuth's work has been criticized by other authors, however, such as Ferguson and Hartley (2009) who argue Malamuth has exaggerated positive findings and has not always properly discussed null findings.&lt;ref name="Ferguson &amp; Hartley (2009)"/&gt;

Because pornographic film making involves [[unsimulated sex]], usually without [[condom]]s ([[Bareback (sex)|barebacking]]), pornographic actors appear to be particularly vulnerable to [[sexually transmitted disease]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rodriguez-Hart|first1=C|last2=Chitale|first2=RA|last3=Rigg|first3=R|last4=Goldstein|first4=BY|last5=Kerndt|first5=PR|last6=Tavrow|first6=P|title=Sexually transmitted infection testing of adult film performers: is disease being missed?|journal=Sexually transmitted diseases|date=December 2012|volume=39|issue=12|pages=989–94|doi=10.1097/OLQ.0b013e3182716e6e|pmid=23191956}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grudzen|first1=CR|last2=Meeker|first2=D|last3=Torres|first3=J|last4=Du|first4=Q|last5=Andersen|first5=RM|last6=Gelberg|first6=L|title=HIV and STI risk behaviors, knowledge, and testing among female adult film performers as compared to other California women.|journal=AIDS and behavior|date=February 2013|volume=17|issue=2|pages=517–22|doi=10.1007/s10461-011-0090-0|pmid=22101890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldstein|first1=BY|last2=Steinberg|first2=JK|last3=Aynalem|first3=G|last4=Kerndt|first4=PR|title=High Chlamydia and gonorrhea incidence and reinfection among performers in the adult film industry.|journal=Sexually transmitted diseases|date=July 2011|volume=38|issue=7|pages=644–8|doi=10.1097/OLQ.0b013e318214e408|pmid=21844714}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[AIDS Healthcare Foundation]] tried several times to have California’s Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Occupational Safety and Health’s Appeals Board force companies in the pornography industry to treat actors and actresses as employees subject to [[occupational safety and health]] regulation; in a 2014 case brought against [[Treasure Island Media]] an administrative judge found that the company did have to comply with regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fitz-Gerald|first1=Sean|title=Condoms Required for CA Porn Performers: Judge|url=http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/California-Judge-Issues-Landmark-Ruling-on-Unprotected-Porn-242117921.html|work=NBC Southern California|date=January 27, 2014|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental assessment'''&lt;section begin=overview /&gt;&lt;!--This paragraph is transcluded to [[Environmental law]] --&gt; ('''EA''') is the assessment of the [[environmental impact|environmental consequences]] (positive and negative) of a plan, policy, program, or actual projects prior to the decision to move forward with the proposed action. In this context, the term "'''environmental impact assessment'''" ('''EIA''') is usually used when applied to actual projects by individuals or companies and the term "[[strategic environmental assessment]]" (SEA) applies to policies, plans and programmes most often proposed by organs of state.&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, A.

Chapter 5. {{ISBN|978-1439828731}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental assessments may be governed by rules of [[Administrative law|administrative procedure]] regarding public participation and documentation of decision making, and may be subject to judicial review. &lt;section end=overview /&gt;&lt;!--This paragraph is transcluded to [[Environmental law]]. Please do not delete this code --&gt;

The purpose of the assessment is to ensure that decision makers consider the environmental impacts when deciding whether or not to proceed with a project. The International Association for Impact Assessment (IAIA) defines an environmental impact assessment as "the process of identifying, predicting, evaluating and mitigating the [[Biophysics|biophysical]], social, and other relevant effects of development proposals prior to major decisions being taken and commitments made".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaia.org/publicdocuments/special-publications/Principles%20of%20IA_web.pdf |title=Principle of Environmental Impact Assessment Best Practice |publisher=International Association for Impact Assessment |date=1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507084339/http://www.iaia.org/publicdocuments/special-publications/Principles%20of%20IA_web.pdf |archivedate=2012-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; EIAs are unique in that they do not require adherence to a predetermined environmental outcome, but rather they require decision makers to [[environmental full-cost accounting|account for environmental values]] in their decisions and to justify those decisions in light of detailed environmental studies and public comments on the potential environmental impacts.&lt;ref&gt;Holder, J., (2004), Environmental Assessment: The Regulation of Decision Making, Oxford University Press, New York; For a comparative discussion of the elements of various domestic EIA systems, see Christopher Wood Environmental Impact Assessment: A Comparative Review (2 ed, Prentice Hall, Harlow, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|3}}

== History ==

Environmental impact assessments commenced in the 1960s, as part of increasing [[environmental awareness]].&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]  was established on 2 December 1970, in response to elevated concern about [[environmental pollution]].&lt;/ref&gt; EIAs involved a technical evaluation intended to contribute to more objective decision making. In the United States, environmental impact assessments obtained formal status in 1969, with enactment of the [[National Environmental Policy Act]]. EIAs have been used increasingly around the world. The number of "Environmental Assessments" filed every year "has vastly overtaken the number of more rigorous [[Environmental Impact Statement]]s (EIS)."{{sfn|Clark|Canter|1997|p=199}} An Environmental Assessment is a "mini-EIS designed to provide sufficient information to allow the agency to decide whether the preparation of a full-blown Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is necessary."{{sfn|Rychlak|Case|2010|p=111-120}}{{sfn|Kershner|2011}}
EIA is an activity that is done to find out the impact that would be done before development will occur.

== Methods ==
General and industry specific assessment methods are available including:

* ''Industrial products'' – Product environmental [[life cycle analysis]] (LCA) is used for identifying and measuring the impact of industrial products on the environment. These EIAs consider activities related to extraction of raw materials, ancillary materials, equipment; production, use, disposal and ancillary equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, S., Tsoulfas, G., Pappis, C., &amp; Rachaniotis, N. (2004) Aggregating and evaluating the results of different Environmental Impact Assessment methods Ecological indicators 4:125–138&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Genetically modified plants'' – Specific methods available to perform EIAs of [[genetically modified organisms]] include GMP-RAM and INOVA.&lt;ref&gt;Hitzschky, K., &amp; Silviera, J. (2009) A proposed impact assessment method for genetically modified plants (As-GMP method) Environmental Impact Assessment review 29: 348–368&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Fuzzy logic]]'' – EIA methods need measurement data to estimate values of impact indicators. However, many of the environment impacts cannot be quantified, e.g. landscape quality, lifestyle quality and social acceptance. Instead information from similar EIAs, expert judgment and community sentiment are employed. Approximate reasoning methods known as fuzzy logic can be used.&lt;ref&gt;Peche, R., &amp; Rodriguez, E., (2009) Environmental impact Assessment procedure: A new approach based on Fuzzy logic Environmental Impact Assessment review 29:275–283&lt;/ref&gt; A fuzzy arithmetic approach has also been proposed&lt;ref&gt;Duarte O. (2000) Técnicas Difusas en la Evaluación de Impacto Ambiental. Ph.D. Thesis, Universidad de Granada&lt;/ref&gt; and implemented using a software tool (TDEIA).&lt;ref&gt;ARAI Research Group, Granada, Spain. [http://arai.ugr.es/eiadifusa/ "Environmental Impact Assessment at University of Granada."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025165732/http://arai.ugr.es/eiadifusa/ |date=2014-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Follow-up ==
At the end of the project, an audit evaluates the accuracy of the EIA by comparing actual to predicted impacts. The objective is to make future EIAs more valid and effective. Two primary considerations are:
* ''Scientific'' – to examine the accuracy of predictions and explain errors
* ''Management'' – to assess the success of mitigation in reducing impacts

Audits can be performed either as a rigorous assessment of the [[null hypothesis]] or with a simpler approach comparing what actually occurred against the predictions in the EIA document.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, L., (1998), A Practical Method for Environmental Impact Assessment Audits Environ Impact Assess Rev 18: 59–71&lt;/ref&gt;

After an EIA, the [[Precautionary principle|precautionary]] and [[polluter pays principle]]s may be applied to decide whether to reject, modify or require [[strict liability]] or [[insurance]] coverage to a project, based on predicted harms.

The [[Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol]] is a sector specific method for checking the quality of Environmental and Social assessments and management plans.

== Around the world ==

=== Australia ===

The history of EIA in Australia could be linked to the enactment of the [[National Environmental Policy Act|U.S. National Environment Policy Act]] (NEPA) in 1970, which made the preparation of environmental impact statements a requirement. In Australia, one might say that the EIA procedures were introduced at a State Level prior to that of the Commonwealth (Federal), with a majority of the states having divergent views to the Commonwealth. One of the pioneering states was New South Wales, whose State Pollution Control Commission issued EIA guidelines in 1974. At a Commonwealth (i.e. Federal) level, this was followed by passing of the ''Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974'' (Cth) in 1974. The ''Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999'' (Cth) (EPBC Act) superseded the ''Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974'' (Cth) and is the current central piece for EIA in Australia on a Commonwealth (i.e. Federal) level. An important point to note is that this federal legislation does not override the validity of the States or Territories environmental and development assessments and approvals; rather the EPBC Act runs as a parallel to the State/Territory Systems.&lt;ref name="Elliott"&gt;Elliott, M. &amp; Thomas, I. (2009), "Environment Impact Assessment in Australia: Theory and Practice, 5th Edn, Federation Press, Sydney"&lt;/ref&gt; Overlap between federal and state requirements is addressed via bilateral agreements or one-off accreditation of state processes, as provided for in the EPBC Act.

==== The Commonwealth Level ====

The EPBC Act provides a legal framework to protect and manage nationally and internationally important flora, fauna, ecological communities and heritage places-defined in the EPBC Act as matters of ‘National Environmental Significance’. Following are the nine matters of ‘National Environmental Significance’ to which the EPBC Act applies:&lt;ref name="department" /&gt;

* World Heritage properties;
* National Heritage places;
* Wetlands of international importance (listed under the Ramsar Convention);
* Listed threatened species and ecological communities;
* Migratory species protected under international agreements;
* Commonwealth marine areas;
* the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park;
* Nuclear actions (including uranium mining); and
* Water resources, in relation with coal seam gas development and large coal mining development.

In addition to this, the EPBC Act aims at providing a streamlined national assessment and approval process for activities. These activities could be by the Commonwealth, or its agents, anywhere in the world or activities on Commonwealth land; and activities that are listed as having a ‘significant impact’ on matters of ‘national environment significance'.&lt;ref name="department"&gt;{{citation|publisher=The Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts|location=Australia|title=The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/epbc/|accessdate=9 September 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007230525/http://www.environment.gov.au/epbc/|archivedate=7 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPBC Act comes into play when a person (a ‘proponent') wants an action (often called a ‘proposal’ or ‘project’) assessed for environmental impacts under the EPBC Act, he or she must refer the project to the Department of the Environment and Energy (Commonwealth). This ‘referral’ is then released to the public, as well as relevant state, territory and Commonwealth ministers, for comment on whether the project is likely to have a significant impact on matters of national environmental significance.&lt;ref name="department" /&gt; The Department of the Environment and Energy assess the process and makes recommendation to the minister or the delegate for the feasibility. The final discretion on the decision remains of the minister, which is not solely based on matters of ‘national environmental significance’ but also the consideration of social and economic impact of the project.&lt;ref name="department" /&gt;

The Australian Government Minister for the Environment and Energy cannot intervene in a proposal if it has no significant impact on one of the eight matters of ‘national environmental significance’ despite the fact that there may be other undesirable environmental impacts.&lt;ref name="department" /&gt; This is primarily due to the division of powers between the States and the Federal government and due to which the Australian Government environment minister cannot overturn a state decision.

There are strict civil and criminal penalties for the breach of EPBC Act. Depending on the kind of breach, civil penalty (maximum) may go up to $550,000 for an individual and $5.5 million for a body corporate, or for criminal penalty (maximum) of seven years imprisonment and/or penalty of $46,200.&lt;ref name="department" /&gt;

==== The State and Territory Level ====

===== Australian Capital Territory (ACT) =====

EIA provisions within Ministerial Authorities in the ACT are found in the Chapters 7 and 8 of the ''Planning and Development Act 2007'' (ACT). EIA in ACT was previously administered with the help of Part 4 of the Land (Planning and Environment) Act 1991 (Land Act) and Territory Plan (plan for land-use).&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;
Note that some EIA may occur in the ACT on Commonwealth land under the EPBC Act (Cth). Further provisions of the ''Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988'' (Cth) may also be applicable particularly to national land and "designated areas".

===== New South Wales (NSW) =====

In New South Wales, the ''Environment Planning and Assessment Act 1979'' (EP&amp;A Act) establishes two pathways for EIA. The first is under Division 5.2 of the EP&amp;A Act, which provides for EIA of 'State Significant Infrastructure' projects (from June 2011, this Part replaced the previous Part 3A, which previously covered EIA of major projects). The second is under Part 4 of the EP&amp;A Act dealing with development assessments for local, regional, and State Significant Developments (other than State Significant Infrastructure).&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;

===== Northern Territory (NT) =====
The EIA process in Northern Territory is chiefly administered under the Environmental Assessment Act (EAA).&lt;ref&gt;The Northern Territory Government, viewed 10 September 2010,&lt;/ref&gt; Although EAA is the primary tool for EIA in Northern Territory, there are further provisions for proposals in the Inquiries Act 1985 (NT).&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;

=====Queensland (QLD)=====
There are four main EIA processes in Queensland.&lt;ref name=Defenders&gt;The Environment Defenders, viewed 10 September 2010, [http://www.edo.org.au/edoqld/edoqld/factsheets/factsheet11%2009.07.pdf EDO factsheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716023121/http://www.edo.org.au/edoqld/edoqld/factsheets/factsheet11%2009.07.pdf |date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, under the Integrated Planning Act 1997 (IPA) for development projects other than mining. Secondly, under the Chapter 3 of the ''Environmental Protection Act 1994'' (Qld) (EP Act) for some mining and petroleum activities. Thirdly, under the ''State Development and Public Works Organisation Act 1971'' (Qld) (State Development Act) for ‘significant projects’. Finally, under the ''Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999'' (Cth) for ‘controlled actions’.&lt;ref name="Defenders" /&gt;

'''South Australia (SA)'''

The local governing tool for EIA in South Australia is the ''Development Act 1993'' (SA). There are three levels of assessment possible under the Act in the form of an environment impact statement (EIS), a public environmental report (PER) or a Development Report (DR).&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;

=====Tasmania (TAS)=====
In Tasmania, an integrated system of legislation is used to govern development and approval process, this system is a mixture of the E''nvironmental Management and Pollution Control Act 1994'' (Tas) (EMPC Act), ''Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993'' (Tas) (LUPA Act), ''State Policies and Projects Act 1993'' (Tas) (SPPA), and ''Resource Management and Planning Appeals Tribunal Act 1993'' (Tas).&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;

=====Victoria (VIC)=====
The EIA process in Victoria is intertwined with the ''[[Environment Effects Act 1978]]'' (Vic) and the Ministerial Guidelines for Assessment of Environmental Effects (made under the s 10 of the EE Act).&lt;ref&gt;The Law Handbook, viewed 9 September 2010,&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Western Australia (WA)=====
Part 4 of the ''Environmental Protection Act 1986'' (WA) provides the legislative framework for the EIA process in Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;The Government of Western Australia, viewed 9 September 2010,&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA Act oversees the planning and development proposals and assesses their likely impacts on the environment.

===Canada===
In ''Friends of the Oldman River Society v. Canada (Minister of Transportation)'',{{harv|SCC|1992}} [[Gérard La Forest|La Forest J]] of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] described environmental impact assessment in terms of the proper scope of federal jurisdiction with respect to environments matters,{{quotation|"Environmental impact assessment is, in its simplest form, a planning tool that is now generally regarded as an integral component of sound decision-making."{{sfn|SCC|1992}}}}
[[Gérard La Forest|Supreme Court Justice La Forest]] cited {{harv|Cotton|Emond|1981|245}}, "The basic concepts behind environmental assessment are simply stated: (1) early identification and evaluation of all potential environmental consequences of a proposed undertaking; (2) decision making that both guarantees the adequacy of this process and reconciles, to the greatest extent possible, the proponent’s development desires with environmental protection and preservation."&lt;ref name="Cotton1981"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Cotton |last1=Roger|first2=D. Paul |last2=Emond|title=Environmental Impact Assessment|editor=John Swaigen|series=Environmental Rights in Canada|location=Toronto, Ontario|publisher=Butterworths|year=1981 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

La Forest referred to {{harv|Jeffrey|1989||loc= 1.2,1.4}} and {{harv|Emond|1978|p=5}} who described "...environmental assessments as a planning tool with both an information-gathering and a decision-making component" that provide "...an objective basis for granting or denying approval for a proposed development."&lt;ref name="Jeffrey1989"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jeffery |first=Michael I.|title=Environmental Approvals in Canada|location=Toronto, Ontario|publisher=Butterworths|year=1989 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Emond1978"&gt;{{cite book|last=Emond |first=D. P.|title=Environmental Assessment Law in Canada|location=Toronto, Ontario|publisher=Emond‑Montgomery Ltd.|year=1978 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice La Forest addressed his concerns about the implications of Bill C-45 regarding public navigation rights on lakes and rivers that would contradict previous cases.{{harv|La Forest|1973|178-80}}&lt;ref name="LaForest1973"&gt;{{cite book|last=La Forest, |first=Gérard V.|title=Water Law in Canada|location=Ottawa|publisher=Information Canada|year=1973 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saxe compares these timelines with environmental assessments for the [[Mackenzie Valley Pipeline]]. [[Thomas R.

On 22 April 2013, Official Opposition Environment critic [[Megan Leslie]] issued a statement claiming that the federal government's recent changes to "fish habitat protection, the [[Navigable Waters Protection Act]] and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act", along with gutting existing laws and making cuts to science and research, "will be disastrous, not only for the environment, but also for Canadians’ health and economic prosperity."&lt;ref name="NDP22apr2013"&gt;{{cite news|date=22 April 2013|title=Statement by Official Opposition Environment critic Megan Leslie on Earth Day|url=https://www.ndp.ca/news/statement-official-opposition-environment-critic-megan-leslie-earth-day|publisher=NDP|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170621121734/http://www.ndp.ca/news/statement-official-opposition-environment-critic-megan-leslie-earth-day|archivedate=21 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 September 2012, Leslie argued that with the changes to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act that came into effect 6 July 2012, "seismic testing, dams, wind farms and power plants" no longer required any federal environmental assessment. She also claimed that because the CEAA 2012—which she claimed was rushed through Parliament—dismantled the CEAA 1995, the Oshawa ethanol plant project would no longer have a full federal environmental assessment.&lt;ref name="Leslie26sep2012"&gt;{{cite parl|date=26 September 2012|title=Question period|location=Ottawa, ON|author=Megan Leslie|url=http://openparliament.ca/debates/2012/9/26/megan-leslie-1/|publisher=Open Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Peter Kent (Minister of the Environment) explained that the CEAA 2012 "provides for the Government of Canada and the Environmental Assessment Agency to focus on the large and most significant projects that are being proposed across the country." The 2,000 to 3,000-plus smaller screenings that were in effect under CEAA 1995 became the "responsibility of lower levels of government but are still subject to the same strict federal environmental laws."&lt;ref name="Leslie26sep2012" /&gt; Anne Minh-Thu Quach, MP for Beauharnois—Salaberry, QC, argued that the mammoth budget bill dismantled 50 years of environmental protection without consulting Canadians about the "colossal changes they are making to environmental assessments." She claimed that the federal government is entering into "limited consultations, by invitation only, months after the damage was done."&lt;ref name="Leslie26sep2012" /&gt;

===China===
The Environmental Impact Assessment Law (EIA Law) requires that an environmental impact assessment be completed prior to project construction. However, if a developer completely ignores this requirement and builds a project without submitting an environmental impact statement, the only penalty is that the environmental protection bureau (EPB) may require the developer to do a make-up environmental assessment. If the developer does not complete this make-up assessment within the designated time, only then is the EPB authorized to fine the developer. Even so, the possible fine is capped at a maximum of about US$25,000, a fraction of the overall cost of most major projects. The lack of more stringent enforcement mechanisms has resulted in a significant percentage of projects not completing legally required environmental impact assessments prior to construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Wang| first=Alex| authorlink=| coauthors=| title=Environmental protection in China: the role of law| work=| publisher=| date=2007-02-05| url=http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/745-Environmental-protection-in-China-the-role-of-law| format=| doi=| accessdate=| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516123917/http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/745-Environmental-protection-in-China-the-role-of-law| archivedate=2012-05-16| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China's [[State Environmental Protection Administration]] (SEPA) used the legislation to halt 30 projects in 2004, including three hydro-power plants under the [[Three Gorges]] Project Company. Although one month later (Note as a point of reference, that the typical EIA for a major project in the USA takes one to two years.), most of the 30 halted projects resumed their construction, reportedly having passed the environmental assessment, the fact that these key projects' construction was ever suspended was notable.

A joint investigation by SEPA and the Ministry of Land and Resources in 2004 showed that 30–40% of the mining construction projects went through the procedure of environment impact assessment as required, while in some areas only 6–7% did so. This partly explains why China has witnessed so many mining accidents in recent years.

SEPA alone cannot guarantee the full enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, observed Professor [[Wang Canfa]], director of the centre to help environmental victims at [[China University of Political Science and Law]]. In fact, according to Wang, the rate of China's environmental laws and regulations that are actually enforced is estimated at barely 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Egypt ===
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
EIA is implemented in Egypt under the umbrella of the Ministry of state for environmental affairs. The Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) is responsible for the EIA services.

In June 1997, the responsibility of Egypt's first full-time Minister of State for Environmental Affairs was assigned as stated in the Presidential Decree no.275/1997. From thereon, the new ministry has focused, in close collaboration with the national and international development partners, on defining environmental policies, setting priorities and implementing initiatives within a context of sustainable development.

According to the Law 4/1994 for the Protection of the Environment, the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) was restructured with the new mandate to substitute the institution initially established in 1982. At the central level, EEAA represents the executive arm of the Ministry.

The purpose of EIA is to ensure the protection and conservation of the environment and natural resources including human health aspects against uncontrolled development. The long-term objective is to ensure a sustainable economic development that meets present needs without compromising future generations ability to meet their own needs. EIA is an important tool in the integrated environmental management approach.

EIA must be performed for new establishments or projects and for expansions or renovations of existing establishments according to the Law for the Environment.

The directive was amended again in 2003, following EU signature of the 1998 [[Aarhus Convention]], and once more in 2009. The initial Directive of 1985 and its three amendments have been codified in Directive 2011/92/EU of 13 December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:026:0001:0021:EN:PDF DIRECTIVE 2011/92/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 13 December 2011 on the assessment of the effects of some public and private projects on the environment] from [http://eur-lex.europa.eu Eur-Lex] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907140138/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/ |date=2017-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2001, the issue was enlarged to the assessment of plans and programmes by the so-called ''[[Strategic Environmental Assessment|Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA)]] Directive'' (2001/42/EC), which is now in force.&lt;ref name="watson" /&gt;
Under the EU directive, an EIA must provide certain information to comply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0042:EN:HTML|title=EUR-Lex – 32001L0042 – EN|author=|date=|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are seven key areas that are required:
# Description of the project
#* Description of actual project and site description
#* Break the project down into its key components, i.e. construction, operations, decommissioning
#* For each component list all of the sources of environmental disturbance
#* For each component all the inputs and outputs must be listed, e.g., [[air pollution]], noise, [[hydrology]]
# Alternatives that have been considered
#* Examine alternatives that have been considered
#* Example: in a [[biomass]] power station, will the fuel be sourced locally or nationally?
# Description of the environment
#* List of all aspects of the environment that may be affected by the development
#* Example: populations, [[fauna]], flora, air, soil, water, humans, landscape, cultural heritage
#* This section is best carried out with the help of local experts, e.g. the [[RSPB]] in the UK
# Description of the significant effects on the environment
#* The word significant is crucial here as the definition can vary
#* 'Significant' must be defined
#* The most frequent method used here is use of the [[Leopold matrix]]
#* The matrix is a tool used in the systematic examination of potential interactions
#* Example: in a windfarm development a significant impact may be collisions with birds
# Mitigation
#* This is where EIA is most useful
#* Once section 4 is complete, it is obvious where impacts are greatest
#* Using this information ways to avoid negative impacts should be developed
#* Best working with the developer with this section as they know the project best
#* Using the windfarm example again, construction could be out of bird nesting seasons.  Or removal of hardstanding on a potentially contaminated land site, out of the rainy season.
# Non-technical summary (EIS)
#* The EIA is in the public domain and be used in the decision making process
#* It is important that the information is available to the public
#* This section is a summary that does not include jargon or complicated diagrams
#* It should be understood by the informed lay-person
# Lack of know-how/technical difficulties
#* This section is to advise any areas of weakness in knowledge
#* It can be used to focus areas of future research
#* Some developers see the EIA as a starting block for poor environmental management

====Annexed projects====
All projects are either classified as Annex 1 or Annex 2 projects. Those lying in Annex 1 are large scale developments such as motorways, chemical works, bridges, powerstations etc. These always require an EIA under the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive (85,337,EEC as amended). Annex 2 projects are smaller in scale than those referred to in Annex 1. Member States must determine whether these project shall be made subject to an assessment subject to a set of criteria set out in Annex 3 of codified Directive 2011/92/EU.

====The Netherlands====
EIA was implemented in Dutch legislation on September 1, 1987. The categories of projects that require an EIA are summarised in Dutch legislation, the Wet milieubeheer. The use of thresholds for activities makes sure that EIA is obligatory for those activities that may have considerable impacts on the environment.

For projects and plans that fit these criteria, an EIA report is required. The EIA report defines a.o. the proposed initiative, it makes clear the impact of that initiative on the environment and compares this with the impact of possible alternatives with less a negative impact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs1.eia.nl/cms/engelse_c-d-lijsten.pdf List of criteria for EIA/SEA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724151830/http://docs1.eia.nl/cms/engelse_c-d-lijsten.pdf |date=2011-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
EIA in Hong Kong, since 1998, is regulated by the ''Environmental Impact Assessment Ordinance 1997''.

The original proposal to construct the [[Lok Ma Chau Spur Line]] overground across the [[Long Valley, Hong Kong|Long Valley]] failed to get through EIA, and the [[Kowloon–Canton Railway Corporation]] had to change its plan and build the railway underground. In April 2011, the EIA of the Hong Kong section of the [[Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge]] was found to have breached the ordinance, and was declared unlawful. The appeal by the government was allowed in September 2011. However, it was estimated that this EIA court case had increased the construction cost of the Hong Kong section of the bridge by HK$6.5 billion in money-of-the-day prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201110/26/P201110260238.htm |title=LCQ1: Judicial review case regarding the Environmental Impact Assessment reports of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge |author= |date=October 26, 2011 |work=Press Releases |publisher=www.info.gov.hk |accessdate=October 27, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119072107/http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201110/26/P201110260238.htm |archivedate=January 19, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iraq ===
Ministry of Environment of the federal government of Iraq is in charge of issuing Environmental compliance certificate based on an EIA report prepared by professional consultant and thoroughly reviewed by MOE. Any project or activity prior to its establishment or even already existing project has to be approved and obtain such certificate from the MOE. Projects are classified into 3 categories; “A”, “B” and “C”. EIA report is usually obligatory for those projects and activities falling under categories “A” (large-scale) and “B” (small-scale) that may have considerable impacts on environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/eia/documents/WG14_MOS3_nov2010/Diagram_EIA_process_in_Iraq.pdf|title=EIA process in Iraq|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831221814/https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/eia/documents/WG14_MOS3_nov2010/Diagram_EIA_process_in_Iraq.pdf|archivedate=2017-08-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of “A” category activities such as: dams and reservoirs, forestry production projects, industrial plants, irrigation, drainage and flood control, land clearance and leveling, port and harbor development, river basin development, thermal power and hydro-power development, manufacture, transportation and use of pesticides or other hazardous materials, hazardous waste management and disposal....etc. An example of “B” category activities such as: agro-industries, electrical transmission, renewable energy, rural electrification, tourism, rehabilitation or maintenance of highway or rural roads, rehabilitation or modification of existing industrial facilities...etc. preparation of EIA report is usually exempt for projects falling under category “C” that may have low to no impact on environment, and example of “C” category activities: small fish breeding pond, institutional development, most human resources projects...etc.

The main environmental legislations in Iraq are: Law No.64 for cities and land use (1965), Law No.21 for noise prevention (1966), Law No.25 for system of rivers and other water resources protection (1967), Law No.99 for ionized radiation (1980), Law No.89 for public health (drinking water provision, sanitation and environmental monitoring (1981), Law No.79 for protection and improvement of environment (1986), Environmental criteria for agricultural, industrial and public service projects (1990), Law No.3 for protection and improvement of environment (1997), Law No.2 for water systems protection (2001), Law No.44 for creation of Ministry of Environment instead of the council of protection and improvement of environment (2003), Law No.27 for environmental protection and improvement (2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://extwprlegs1.fao.org/docs/pdf/irq100188E.pdf|title=Law No.27 of 2009 for protection and improvement of environment|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901160232/http://extwprlegs1.fao.org/docs/pdf/irq100188E.pdf|archivedate=2017-09-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law No.4 for protection of ambient air system (2012).

=== India ===
The [[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)|Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change]] (MoEFCC) of India has been in a great effort in Environmental Impact Assessment in India. The main laws in action are the Water Act(1974), the Indian [[Wildlife Protection Act of 1972|Wildlife (Protection) Act (1972)]], the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act (1981) and the Environment (Protection) Act (1986),Biological Diversity Act(2002).&lt;ref&gt;Shibani Ghosh, [http://www.nujslawreview.org/pdf/articles/2013_3/03shibanighosh.pdf "Demystifying the Environmental Clearance Process in India"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221023322/http://nujslawreview.org/pdf/articles/2013_3/03shibanighosh.pdf |date=2015-02-21 }}, ''NUJS LAW REVIEW'', January 2, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The responsible body for this is the Central Pollution Control Board.
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) studies need a significant amount of primary and secondary environmental data. Primary data are those collected in the field to define the status of the environment (like air quality data, water quality data etc.). Secondary data are those collected over the years that can be used to understand the existing environmental scenario of the study area. The environmental impact assessment (EIA) studies are conducted over a short period of time and therefore the understanding of the environmental trends, based on a few months of primary data, has limitations. Ideally, the primary data must be considered along with the secondary data for complete understanding of the existing environmental status of the area. In many EIA studies, the secondary data needs could be as high as 80% of the total data requirement. EIC is the repository of one stop secondary data source for environmental impact assessment in India.

The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) experience in India indicates that the lack of timely availability of reliable and authentic environmental data has been a major bottle neck in achieving the full benefits of EIA. The environment being a multi-disciplinary subject, a multitude of agencies are involved in collection of environmental data. However, no single organization in India tracks available data from these agencies and makes it available in one place in a form required by environmental impact assessment practitioners. Further, environmental data is not available in enhanced forms that improve the quality of the EIA. This makes it harder and more time-consuming to generate environmental impact assessments and receive timely environmental clearances from regulators. With this background, the Environmental Information Centre (EIC) has been set up to serve as a professionally managed clearing house of environmental information that can be used by MoEF, project proponents, consultants, NGOs and other stakeholders involved in the process of environmental impact assessment in India. EIC caters to the need of creating and disseminating of organized environmental data for various developmental initiatives all over the country.

EIC stores data in GIS format and makes it available to all environmental impact assessment studies and to EIA stakeholders in a cost effective and timely manner. So that we can manage that in different proportions such as remedy measures etc.,

In Malaysia, Section 34A, Environmental Quality Act, 1974&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doe.gov.my/portal/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Appendix_1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721014734/http://www.doe.gov.my/portal/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Appendix_1.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; requires developments that have significant impact to the environment are required to conduct the Environmental impact assessment.

=== Nepal ===
In Nepal, EIA has been integrated in major development projects since the early 1980s. In the planning history of Nepal, the sixth plan (1980–85), for the first time, recognized the need for EIA with the establishment of Environmental Impact Study Project (EISP) under the Department of Soil Conservation in 1982 to develop necessary instruments for integration of EIA in infrastructure
development projects. However, the government of Nepal enunciated environment conservation related
policies in the seventh plan (NPC, 1985–1990). To enforce this policy and make necessary arrangements, a series of guidelines were developed, thereby incorporating the elements of environmental factors right from the project formulation stage of the development plans
and projects and to avoid or minimize adverse effects on the ecological system. In addition, it has also emphasized that EIAs of industry, tourism, water resources, transportation, urbanization, agriculture, forest and other developmental projects be conducted.

In Nepal, the government's Environmental Impact Assessment Guideline of 1993 inspired the enactment of the Environment Protection Act (EPA) of 1997 and the Environment Protection Rules (EPR) of 1997 (EPA and EPR have been enforced since 24 and 26 June 1997 respectively in Nepal) to internalizing the environmental assessment system. The process institutionalized the EIA process in development proposals and enactment, which makes the integration of IEE and EIA legally binding to the prescribed projects. The projects, requiring EIA or IEE, are included in Schedules 1 and 2 of the EPR, 1997
(GoN/MoLJPA 1997).

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand, EIA is usually referred to as ''Assessment of Environmental Effects'' (AEE).  The first use of EIA's dates back to a Cabinet minute passed in 1974 called Environmental Protection and Enhancement Procedures. This had no legal force and only related to the activities of government departments. When the [[Resource Management Act 1991|Resource Management Act]] was passed in 1991, an EIA was required as part of a resource consent application. Section 88 of the Act specifies that the AEE must include "such detail as corresponds with the scale and significance of the effects that the activity may have on the environment".  While there is no duty to consult any person when making a resource consent application (Sections 36A and Schedule 4), proof of consultation is almost certain required by local councils when they decide whether or not to publicly notify the consent application under Section 93.

=== Russian Federation ===
As of 2004, the state authority responsible for conducting the State EIA in Russia has been split between two Federal bodies: 1) Federal service for monitoring the use of natural resources – a part of the Russian Ministry for Natural Resources and Environment and 2) Federal Service for Ecological, Technological and Nuclear Control. The two main pieces of environmental legislation in Russia are: The Federal Law ‘On Ecological Expertise, 1995 and the ‘Regulations on Assessment of Impact from Intended Business and Other Activity on Environment in the Russian Federation, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Environmental Protection, Russia&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Federal Service for monitoring the use of natural resources ====
In 2006, the parliament committee on ecology in conjunction with the Ministry for Natural Resources and Environment, created a working group to prepare a number of amendments to existing legislation to cover such topics as stringent project documentation for building of potentially environmentally damaging objects as well as building of projects on the territory of protected areas.
There has been some success in this area, as evidenced from abandonment of plans to construct a gas pipe-line through the only remaining habitat of the critically endangered Amur leopard in the Russian Far East.

==== Federal Service for Ecological, Technological and Nuclear Control ====
The government's decision to hand over control over several important procedures, including state EIA in the field of all types of energy projects, to the Federal Service for Ecological, Technological and Nuclear Control had caused a major controversy and criticism from environmental groups that blamed the government for giving nuclear power industry control over the state EIA.

Not surprisingly the main problem concerning State EIA in Russia is the clear differentiation of jurisdiction between the two above-mentioned Federal bodies.

=== Sri Lanka ===

The National Environmental Act, 1998 requires environmental impact assessment for large scale projects in sensitive areas. It is enforced by the Central Environmental Authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Central Environmental Authority|title=Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Procedure in Sri Lanka|url=http://www.cea.lk/web/index.php/en/environmental-impact-assessment-eia-procedure-in-sri-lanka|website=Central Environmental Authority|publisher=Central Environmental Authority|accessdate=1 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103215340/http://www.cea.lk/web/index.php/en/environmental-impact-assessment-eia-procedure-in-sri-lanka|archivedate=3 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ukraine ===
The new law of Ukraine on evaluation of impact on surroundings prescribes the requirements of environmental safety, rational use of national resources, minimizing of harmful impact on surroundings in the process of making managerial decisions about planned activity. The designing of the conclusion of evaluation of impact is a result of its conducting. The key moment of the law on evaluation of impact on surroundings is a substitution of conclusion of state environmental experise on the conclusion of evaluation of impact on surroundings. Business entity is forbidden to conduct or to start its planned activity without the conclusion of impact on surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MCL LLC|title=Evaluation of impact on surroundings|url=http://www.mcl.kiev.ua/en/evaluation-of-impact-on-surroundings-2/|website=MCL LLC|publisher=Eric Firado|accessdate=1 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201043929/http://www.mcl.kiev.ua/en/evaluation-of-impact-on-surroundings-2/|archivedate=1 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
{{Main|National Environmental Policy Act}}
The [[National Environmental Policy Act]] of 1969 (NEPA), enacted in 1970, established a policy of environmental impact assessment for federal agency actions, federally funded activities or federally permitted/licensed activities that in the U. S. is termed "environmental review" or simply "the NEPA process."&lt;ref&gt;United States. National Environmental Policy Act, [http://www.usinfo.org/enus/government/branches/nepaeqia.htm P.L. 91-190] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516090600/http://www.usinfo.org/enus/government/branches/nepaeqia.htm |date=2013-05-16 }}, {{USStat|83|852|1969}}, {{USC|42|4321}} ''et seq.'' Approved January 1, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; The law also created the [[Council on Environmental Quality]], which promulgated regulations to codify the law's requirements.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Council on Environmental Quality. "NEPA and Agency Planning." ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{USCFR|40|1501}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[United States environmental law]] an Environmental Assessment (EA) is compiled to determine the need for an ''[[Environmental Impact Statement]]'' (EIS).  Federal or federalized actions expected to subject or be subject to significant environmental impacts will publish a Notice of Intent to Prepare an EIS as soon as significance is known.  Certain actions of [[federal government of the United States|federal]] [[government agency|agencies]] must be preceded by the NEPA process.  Contrary to a widespread misconception, NEPA does not prohibit the federal government or its licensees/permittees from harming the environment, nor does it specify any penalty if an environmental impact assessment turns out to be inaccurate, intentionally or otherwise.  NEPA requires that plausible statements as to the prospective impacts be disclosed in advance. The purpose of NEPA process is to ensure that the decision maker is fully informed of the environmental aspects and consequences prior to making the final decision.

==== Environmental assessment ====
An '''environmental assessment''' (EA) is an environmental analysis prepared pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act to determine whether a federal action would significantly affect the environment and thus require a more detailed ''Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)''. The certified release of an Environmental Assessment results in either a ''Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI)'' or an [[Environmental Impact Statement|EIS]].&lt;ref&gt;Eccleston, Charles H. and J. Peyton Doub (2010). [https://www.amazon.com/Preparing-NEPA-Environmental-Assessments-Professional/dp/1439808821/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486949351&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=charles+eccleston Preparing NEPA Environmental Assessments: A User’s Guide to Best Professional Practices]. {{ISBN|978-1439808825}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Council on Environmental Quality]] (CEQ), which oversees the administration of NEPA, issued regulations for implementing the NEPA in 1979. Eccleston reports that the NEPA regulations barely mention preparation of EAs. This is because the EA was originally intended to be a simple document used in relatively rare instances where an agency was not sure if the potential significance of an action would be sufficient to trigger preparation of an EIS. But today, because EISs are so much longer and complicated to prepare, federal agencies are going to great effort to avoid preparing EISs by using EAs, even in cases where the use of EAs may be inappropriate. The ratio of EAs that are being issued compared to EISs is about 100 to 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eccleston |first1=Charles |last2=Doub |first2=J. Peyton |year=2012 |title=Preparing NEPA Environmental Assessments: A User's Guide to Best Professional Practices |location= |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=9781439808825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, even the preparation of an accurate EA is viewed today as an onerous burden by many entities responsible for the environmental review of a proposal. Federal agencies have responded by streamlining their regulations that implement NEPA environmental review, by defining categories of projects that by their well understood nature may be safely excluded from review under NEPA, and by drawing up lists of project types that have negligible material impact upon the environment and can thus be exempted.

===== Content =====
The Environmental Assessment is a concise public document prepared by the federal action agency that serves to:
# briefly provide sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an EIS or a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI)
# Demonstrate compliance with the act when no EIS is required
# facilitate the preparation of an EIS when a FONSI cannot be demonstrated

The Environmental Assessment includes a brief discussion of the purpose and need of the proposal and of its alternatives as required by NEPA 102(2)(E), and of the human environmental impacts resulting from and occurring to the proposed actions and alternatives considered practicable, plus a listing of studies conducted and agencies and stakeholders consulted to reach these conclusions.  The action agency must approve an EA before it is made available to the public. The EA is made public through notices of availability by local, state, or regional clearing houses, often triggered by the purchase of a public notice advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in the proposed activity area.

===== Structure =====
The structure of a generic Environmental Assessment is as follows:
# Summary
# Introduction
#* Background
#* Purpose and Need for Action
#* Proposed Action
#* Decision Framework
#* Public Involvement
#* Issues
# Alternatives, including the Proposed Action
#* Alternatives
#* Mitigation Common to All Alternatives
#* Comparison of Alternatives
# Environmental Consequences
# Consultation and Coordination

===== Procedure =====
The EA becomes a draft public document when notice of it is published, usually in a newspaper of general circulation in the area affected by the proposal. There is a 15-day review period required for an Environmental Assessment (30 days if exceptional circumstances) while the document is made available for public commentary, and a similar time for any objection to improper process. Commenting on the Draft EA is typically done in writing or email, submitted to the lead action agency as published in the notice of availability. An EA does not require a public hearing for verbal comments.  Following the mandated public comment period, the lead action agency responds to any comments, and certifies either a FONSI or a Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an EIS in its public environmental review record.  The preparation of an EIS then generates a similar but more lengthy, involved and expensive process.

==== Environmental impact statement ====
{{main|Environmental impact statement}}
The adequacy of an environmental impact statement (EIS) can be challenged in [[United States federal courts|federal court]].  Major proposed projects have been blocked because of an agency's failure to prepare an acceptable EIS.  One prominent example was the [[Westway (New York)|Westway]] landfill and highway development in and along the [[Hudson River]] in [[New York, New York|New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elr.info/litigation/vol13/13.20326.htm ''Sierra Club v. United States Army Corps of Engineers,''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040328074514/http://www.elr.info/litigation/vol13/13.20326.htm |date=2004-03-28 }}
701 F.2d 1011, 18 ERC 1748. (2d Cir., 02/25/1983)&lt;/ref&gt; Another prominent case involved the [[Sierra Club]] suing the [[Nevada Department of Transportation]] over its denial of the club's request to issue a supplemental EIS addressing air emissions of [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] and hazardous [[air pollutants]] in the case of widening [[U.S. Route 95 in Nevada|U.S. Route 95]] through [[Las Vegas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ritter |first=John |title=Lawsuit pits risks and roads |publisher=USA Today |date=2003-06-03 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-03-06-vegas-highway-usat_x.htm |accessdate= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629064153/http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-03-06-vegas-highway-usat_x.htm |archivedate=2011-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case reached the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]], which led to construction on the highway being halted until the court's final decision. The case was settled prior to the court's final decision.

Several [[State governments of the United States|state governments]] that have adopted "little NEPAs," [[state law]]s imposing EIS requirements for particular state actions. Some of those state laws such as the [[California Environmental Quality Act]] refer to the required environmental impact study as an '''environmental impact report'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sprlaw.com/pdf/spr_little_nepa_ali_aba_0605.pdf |title=Sive,D. &amp; Chertok,M., "Little NEPAs" and Environmental Impact Assessment Procedures |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-01-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004091103/http://www.sprlaw.com/pdf/spr_little_nepa_ali_aba_0605.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This variety of state requirements produces voluminous data not just upon impacts of individual projects, but also in insufficiently researched scientific domains. For example, in a seemingly routine ''Environmental Impact Report'' for the city of [[Monterey, California]], information came to light that led to the official federal endangered species listing of [[Hickman's potentilla]], a rare coastal [[wildflower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rogers|first1=Mark|title=Endangered Flora of California|publisher=lulu.com|ISBN=978-1312862784|page=106|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O17xCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=C.M.+Hogan,+G.+Deghi,+M.+Papineau+et+al.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZKZSMO9-Y6&amp;sig=gezVDrq4tzoDHNmrQfNjAXjcguw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi7-KmQsMTQAhXP0RoKHRzOBAUQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=C.M.%20Hogan%2C%20G.%20Deghi%2C%20M.%20Papineau%20et%20al.&amp;f=false|accessdate=November 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.M. Hogan, G. Deghi, M. Papineau et al., ''Environmental Impact Report for the Pebble Beach Properties project by Del Monte Forest'', Earth Metrics Inc. Prepared for the city of Monterey and State of California Clearinghouse (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. [[Federal Register]]: August 2, 1995 (Volume 60, Number 148, Pages 39326-39337)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transboundary application ==
Environmental threats do not respect national borders. International pollution can have detrimental effects on the atmosphere, oceans, rivers, [[aquifer]]s, farmland, the weather and biodiversity. Global climate change is transnational. Specific pollution threats include [[acid rain]], [[radioactive contamination]], [[Space debris|debris in outer space]], [[Stratosphere|stratospheric]] [[ozone depletion]] and toxic [[oil spill]]s. The [[Chernobyl disaster]], precipitated by a [[Nuclear and radiation accidents|nuclear accident]] on April 26, 1986, is a stark reminder of the devastating effects of transboundary nuclear pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Sands, P., (1989), The Environment, Community and International Law, Harvard International Law Lournal, 393, p402&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental protection is inherently a cross-border issue and has led to the creation of transnational regulation via multilateral and bilateral treaties. The [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] (UNCHE or Stockholm Conference) held in [[Stockholm]] in 1972 and the [[Earth Summit|United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development]] (UNCED or Rio Summit, Rio Conference, or Earth Summit) held in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1992 were key in the creation of about 1,000 international instruments that include at least some provisions related to the environment and its protection.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, E., (1999), Understanding Compliance with International Environmental Agreements: The Bakers Dozen Myths, Univ Richmond L.R. 32, 1555&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe|United Nations Economic Commission for Europe's]] [[Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context]] was negotiated to provide an international legal framework for transboundary EIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unece.org/env/eia/welcome.html |title=Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context (Espoo, 1991) |publisher=Unece.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126142541/http://www.unece.org/env/eia/welcome.html |archivedate=2013-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as there is no universal legislature or administration with a comprehensive mandate, most international treaties exist parallel to one another and are further developed without the benefit of consideration being given to potential conflicts with other agreements. There is also the issue of international enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfrum, R., &amp; Matz, N., (2003), Conflicts in International Environmental Law, Max-Planck-Institut für Ausländisches Öffentliches Recht und Völkerrech&lt;/ref&gt;
This has led to duplications and failures, in part due to an inability to enforce agreements. An example is the failure of many international 
fisheries regimes to restrict harvesting practises.&lt;ref&gt;Young, O., (1999), The Effectiveness of International Environmental Regimes, [[MIT Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Application shall be achieved by the willing of counties authorities. / Aphro10

== Criticism ==
As per Jay ''et al.'', EIA is used as a decision aiding tool rather than decision making tool. There is growing dissent about them as their influence on decisions is limited. Improved training for practitioners, guidance on bestpractice and continuing research have all been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jay |first1=S. |last2=Jones |first2=C. |last3=Slinn |first3=P. |last4=Wood |first4=C. |year=2007 |title=Environmental Impact Assessment: Retrospect and Prospect |url= |journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review |publisher=Elsevier |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=289–300 |doi=10.1016/j.eiar.2006.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EIAs have been criticized for excessively limiting their scope in space and time. No accepted procedure exists for determining such boundaries. The boundary refers to ‘the spatial and temporal boundary of the proposal’s effects’. This boundary is determined by the applicant and the lead assessor, but in practice, almost all EIAs address only direct and immediate on-site effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lenzen |first1=M. |last2=Murray |first2=S. |last3=Korte |first3=B. |last4=Dey |first4=C. |year=2003 |title=Environmental impact assessment including indirect effects—a case study using input-output analysis |url= |journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review |publisher=Elsevier |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=263–282 |doi=10.1016/S0195-9255(02)00104-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development causes both direct and indirect effects. Consumption of goods and services, production, use and disposal of building materials and machinery, additional land use for activities of manufacturing and services, mining and refining, etc., all have environmental impacts. The indirect effects of development can be much higher than the direct effects examined by an EIA. Proposals such as [[airports]] or [[shipyards]] cause wide-ranging national and international effects, which should be covered in EIAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shepherd |first1=A. |last2=Ortolano |first2=L. |year=1996 |title=Strategic environmental assessment for sustainable urban development |url= |journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review |publisher=Elsevier |volume=16 |issue=4–6 |pages=321–335 |doi=10.1016/S0195-9255(96)00071-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadening the scope of EIA can benefit the conservation of threatened species. Instead of concentrating on the project site, some EIAs employed a [[habitat]]-based approach that focused on much broader relationships among humans and the environment. As a result, alternatives that reduce the negative effects to the population of whole species, rather than local subpopulations, can be assessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fernandes |first1=João P. |year=2000 |title=EIA procedure, Landscape ecology and conservation management—Evaluation of alternatives in a highway EIA process |url= |journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review |publisher=Elsevier |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=665–680 |doi=10.1016/S0195-9255(00)00060-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thissen and Agusdinata&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thissen |first1=WIH |last2=Agusdinata |first2=DB |year=2008 |title=Handling deep uncertainties in impact assessment|url= |journal=In proceedings of the 28th annual conference of the IAIA May 5–9, 2008, Perth, Australia. |publisher=IAIA |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that little attention is given to the systematic identification and assessment of uncertainties in environmental studies which is critical in situations where uncertainty cannot be easily reduced by doing more research. In line with this, Maier et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maier  |first1=HR |last2=Ascough  |first2=JC |last3=Wattenbach  |first3=M |last4=Renschler  |first4=CS |last5=Labiosa   |first5=WB |year=2008 |title=Uncertainty in Environmental Decision Making: Issues, Challenges and Future Directions |url= |journal=Publications from USDA-ARS/UNL Faculty. Paper 399.|publisher=USDA-ARS/UNL Faculty |volume= |issue= |pages=|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have concluded on the need to consider uncertainty at all stages of the decision-making process. In such a way decisions can be made with confidence or known uncertainty. These proposals are justified on data that shows that environmental assessments fail to predict accurately the impacts observed. Tenney et al.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tenney   |first1=A |last2=Kværner   |first2=J |last3=Gjerstad   |first3=KI |year=2006 |title=Uncertainty in environmental impact assessment predictions: the need for better communication and more transparency|url= |journal=Impact Assessment and Project Appraisal| publisher=|volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=45–56|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wood et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wood    |first1=C |last2=, Dipper |first2=B |last3= Jones    |first3=C |year=2000 |title=Auditing the assessments of the environmental impacts of planning projects|url= |journal=Journal of Environmental Planning and Management| publisher=|volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=23–47|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have reported evidence of the intrinsic uncertainty attached to EIAs predictions from a number of case studies worldwide. The gathered evidence consisted of comparisons between predictions in EIAs and the impacts measured during, or following project implementation. In explaining this trend, Tenney et al.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; have highlighted major causes such as project changes, modelling errors, errors in data and assumptions taken and bias introduced by people in the projects analyzed.

'''Environmental science''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] [[academic field]] that integrates physical, biological and [[information science]]s (including [[ecology]], [[biology]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[plant science]], [[zoology]], [[mineralogy]], [[oceanography]], [[limnology]], [[soil science]], [[geology]] and [[physical geography]] ([[geodesy]]), and [[atmospheric science]]) to the study of the environment, and the solution of environmental problems.

Environmental scientists work on subjects like the understanding of earth processes, evaluating [[alternative energy]] systems, [[pollution control]] and mitigation, [[natural resource management]], and the [[effects of global warming|effects of global climate change]]. [[Environmental issues]] almost always include an interaction of physical, chemical, and biological processes. Environmental scientists bring a systems approach to the analysis of environmental problems. Key elements of an effective environmental scientist include the ability to relate space, and time relationships as well as quantitative analysis.

Environmental science came alive as a substantive, active field of scientific investigation in the 1960s and 1970s driven by (a) the need for a [[multi-disciplinary]] approach to analyze complex environmental problems, (b) the arrival of substantive environmental laws requiring specific environmental protocols of investigation and (c) the growing public awareness of a need for action in addressing environmental problems. Events that spurred this development included the publication of [[Rachel Carson]]'s landmark environmental book ''[[Silent Spring]]&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Rachel. ''Silent Spring'' (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1962), Mariner Books, 2002, {{ISBN|0-618-24906-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' along with major environmental issues becoming very public, such as the [[1969 Santa Barbara oil spill]], and the [[Cuyahoga River]] of Cleveland, Ohio, "catching fire" (also in 1969), and helped increase the visibility of environmental issues and create this new field of study.

==Terminology==
{{See also|Glossary of environmental science}}

In common usage, "environmental science" and "ecology" are often used interchangeably, but technically, ecology refers only to the study of organisms and their interactions with each other and their environment. Ecology could be considered a subset of environmental science, which also could involve purely chemical or [[public health]] issues (for example) ecologists would be unlikely to study. In practice, there is considerable overlap between the work of ecologists and other environmental scientists.

The National Center for Education Statistics in the United States defines an academic program in environmental science as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A program that focuses on the application of biological, chemical, and physical principles to the study of the physical environment and the solution of environmental problems, including subjects such as abating or controlling environmental pollution and degradation; the interaction between human society and the natural environment; and natural resources management. Includes instruction in biology, chemistry, physics, geosciences, climatology, statistics, and mathematical modeling.&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Education Statistics. ''[http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2002/cip2000/occupationallookup6d.ASP?CIP=03.0104 Classification of Instructional Programs]''. United States Department of Education, Institute of Education Sciences, 2000. (Accessed 29 January 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Atmospheric sciences ===
{{Main|Atmospheric sciences}}
Atmospheric sciences focus on the Earth's atmosphere, with an emphasis upon its interrelation to other systems. Atmospheric sciences can include studies of [[meteorological|meteorology]], [[greenhouse gas]] phenomena, [[atmospheric dispersion modeling]] of airborne contaminants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Beychok, M.R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Turner, D.B.|title=Workbook of atmospheric dispersion estimates: an introduction to dispersion modeling|edition=2nd|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|year=1994|isbn=1-56670-023-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; sound propagation phenomena related to [[noise pollution]], and even [[light pollution]].

Taking the example of the [[global warming]] phenomena, physicists create [[computer model]]s of atmospheric circulation and [[infra-red radiation]] transmission, chemists examine the inventory of atmospheric chemicals and their reactions, biologists analyze the plant and animal contributions to [[carbon dioxide]] fluxes, and specialists such as [[meteorologist]]s and [[oceanographer]]s add additional breadth in understanding the [[atmospheric dynamics]].

=== Ecology ===
{{Main|Ecology}}
[[File:Blue Linckia Starfish.JPG|thumb|left|[[Biodiversity]] of a coral reef. Corals adapt and modify their environment by forming [[calcium carbonate]] skeletons. This provides growing conditions for future generations and forms a habitat for many other species.]]
Ecology is the study of the interactions between organisms and their environment. Ecologists might investigate the relationship between a population of organisms and some physical characteristic of their environment, such as concentration of a chemical; or they might investigate the interaction between two populations of different organisms through some symbiotic or competitive relationship.

For example, an interdisciplinary analysis of an ecological system which is being impacted by one or more stressors might include several related environmental science fields. In an estuarine setting where a proposed industrial development could impact certain species by [[water pollution|water]] and [[air pollution]], [[biologist]]s would describe the flora and fauna, [[chemist]]s would analyze the transport of [[water pollutant]]s to the marsh, [[physicist]]s would calculate air pollution emissions and [[geologist]]s would assist in understanding the marsh soils and bay muds.

=== Environmental chemistry ===
{{Main|Environmental chemistry}}

Environmental chemistry is the study of chemical alterations in the environment. Principal areas of study include [[soil contamination]] and water pollution. The topics of analysis include chemical degradation in the environment, multi-phase transport of chemicals (for example, evaporation of a [[solvent]] containing lake to yield solvent as an air pollutant), and chemical effects upon [[biota (ecology)|biota]].

As an example study, consider the case of a leaking solvent tank which has entered the habitat soil of an [[endangered species]] of amphibian. As a method to resolve or understand the extent of [[soil contamination]] and subsurface transport of solvent, a [[computer model]] would be implemented. Chemists would then characterize the [[molecular bonding]] of the solvent to the specific soil type, and biologists would study the impacts upon soil [[arthropod]]s, plants, and ultimately pond-dwelling organisms that are the food of the endangered amphibian.

=== Geosciences ===
{{Main|Geosciences}}

Geosciences include [[environmental geology]], [[environmental soil science]], [[volcanic]] phenomena and evolution of the Earth's crust. In some classification systems this can also include [[hydrology]], including [[oceanography]].

As an example study of soils [[erosion]], calculations would be made of [[surface runoff]] by soil scientists. Fluvial geomorphologists would assist in examining [[sediment transport]] in overland flow. Physicists would contribute by assessing the changes in light transmission in the receiving waters. Biologists would analyze subsequent impacts to aquatic flora and fauna from increases in water turbidity.

==Regulations driving the studies==
[[File:Glen Canyon Dam &amp; Lake Powell.jpg|thumb|Environmental science examines the effects of humans on nature ([[Glen Canyon Dam]] in the U.S.)]]
In the U.S. the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA) of 1969 set forth requirements for analysis of major projects in terms of specific environmental criteria. Numerous state laws have echoed these mandates, applying the principles to local-scale actions. The upshot has been an explosion of documentation and study of environmental consequences before the fact of development actions.

One can examine the specifics of environmental science by reading examples of [[Environmental Impact Statement]]s prepared under NEPA  such as: ''Wastewater treatment expansion options discharging into the San Diego/[[Tijuana]] [[Estuary]]'', ''Expansion of the [[San Francisco International Airport]]'', ''Development of the [[Houston]], Metro Transportation system'', ''Expansion of the metropolitan [[Boston]] MBTA transit system'', and ''Construction of [[Interstate 66]] through [[Arlington, Virginia]]''.

In England and Wales the [[Environment Agency]] (EA),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/ Environment Agency&lt;/ref&gt; formed in 1996, is a public body for protecting and improving the environment and enforces the regulations listed on the communities and local government site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1503251] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812001715/http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1503251|date=12 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; (formerly the office of the deputy prime minister). The agency was set up under the [[Environment Act 1995]] as an independent body and works closely with UK Government to enforce the regulations.

In the study of [[transsexualism]], the [[essentialism|essentialist]] idea of a '''feminine essence''' refers to the proposal that [[Trans woman|male-to-female transsexuals]] are females trapped in male bodies.  This idea has been interpreted in many senses, as a female mind, spirit, soul, personality, etc., as well as in more literal senses such as having a female brain structure; it is also a [[psychological narrative]], that is, a self-description of how some transsexuals see themselves, or of how they may portray themselves to qualify for certain medical treatments.

According to sexologist [[J. Michael Bailey]] and Kiira Triea, "the predominant cultural understanding of male-to-female transsexualism is that all male-to-female (MtF) transsexuals are, essentially, women trapped in men's bodies."  They reject the idea, claiming that "The persistence of the predominant cultural understanding, while explicable, is damaging to science and to many transsexuals."&lt;ref name=Bailey2007&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bailey J.

The great majority of patients understand full well that this is a ''[[wikt:façon de parler|façon de parler]],'' not a literal statement of fact, and are not delusional in any normal sense of the word."&lt;ref name="UTorontoRounds2000"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autogynephilia.org/psychiatry_rounds.pdf|title=Psychiatry Rounds: The case for and against publicly funded transsexual surgery|date=April 2000|publisher=Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto Centre for Addiction and Mental Health; Toronto, Ontario|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304092619/http://www.autogynephilia.org/psychiatry_rounds.pdf|archive-date=2012-03-04|volume=4|issue=2|accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feminine essence idea has been described under several names, and there is no authoritative, widely accepted definition.&lt;ref name=Blanchard2008 /&gt;  It was called the ''feminine essence narrative'' by [[Alice Dreger]] in 2008,&lt;ref name=Dreger2008&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dreger AD |title=The Controversy Surrounding The Man Who Would Be Queen: A Case History of the Politics of Science, Identity, and Sex in the Internet Age |journal=Arch Sex Behav |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=366–421 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18431641 |doi=10.1007/s10508-007-9301-1 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/0753m756162q4236/fulltext.pdf |pmc=3170124}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''feminine essence theory'' by Ray Blanchard, who formulated the concept into a set of logical propositions.&lt;ref name=Blanchard2008&gt;{{cite journal |author=Blanchard R |title=Deconstructing the feminine essence narrative |journal=Arch Sex Behav |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=434–8; discussion 505–10 |date=June 2008 |pmid= 18431630|doi=10.1007/s10508-008-9328-y |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other names include ''[[Harry Benjamin]] syndrome'', after one of the early sexologists whose early writings about the nature of transsexualism, along with those of psychiatrist [[David O. Cauldwell]], are favorably cited by proponents in support of this idea.&lt;ref name="How Sex Changed"&gt;{{cite book

|quote=As the medical literature on transsexuals emerged, the doctors and scientists involved drew, as Ulrichs had, a distinction between the sex in the mind, as seen in the sense of self, and the sex in the body, as generally evidenced in the genitals.  Cauldwell referred to individuals who were "physically of one sex and apparently psychologically of the opposite sex."  Hamburger and his colleagues wrote of a "female personality in a male body" and the "feeling of being a woman."  Benjamin borrowed Ulrichs' formula of "a female soul'... in [a] male body."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This idea is associated with, but separate from the brainsex theory of transsexualism, which is a belief about a neurodevelopmental [[cause of transsexualism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailey and Triea, 2007.  "The narrative has been extended to an etiological theory, which Lawrence (2007b) has called "the brainsex theory of transsexualism." The transsexual advocacy website, transsexual.org, puts this theory succinctly: 'A transsexual is a person in which the sex-related structures of the brain that define gender identity are exactly opposite the physical sex organs of the body.'"&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the brainsex theory of transsexualism draw a distinction between "brain sex" and "anatomical sex".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harrybenjaminsyndrome-nz.co.nz/ |title=Harry Benjamin Syndrome (HBS) |accessdate=6 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202040714/http://www.harrybenjaminsyndrome-nz.co.nz/ |archivedate=2 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some proponents reject the term ''transsexual'', as the ''[[:wikt:trans-|trans-]]'' prefix implies that their true sex is changing, instead of being affirmed, with treatments like [[sex reassignment surgery]].  Some proponents consider themselves to be [[intersex]] instead of transgender.&lt;ref name=HBS&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A figurative interpretation, involving neurologically mediated [[gender identity]], was supported historically by pioneering sexologists such as [[Harry Benjamin]].&lt;ref name=HBS /&gt;

==Description==

The "feminine essence" idea predates modern psychological studies,&lt;ref name="How Sex Changed" /&gt; and was supported by some early sexologists such as [[Harry Benjamin]] ("the father of transsexualism"), who revived the idea of [[Karl-Heinrich Ulrichs]] that a person might have a "female soul trapped in a male body."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern researchers classify the common story told by transsexual women about themselves as a [[psychological narrative]], and therefore refer to this idea as the "feminine essence narrative".  In his book ''[[The Man Who Would Be Queen]]'', sexologist [[J. Michael Bailey]] gives these statements as a prototypical example of the feminine essence narrative:  "Since I can remember, I have always felt as if I were a member of the other sex. I have felt like a freak with this body and detest my penis. I must get sex reassignment surgery (a "sex change operation") in order to match my external body with my internal mind."&lt;ref name =Dreger2008/&gt;

==Blanchard's deconstruction==

In 2008, [[Ray Blanchard]] presented the idea in the form of a theory in a commentary entitled "Deconstructing the Feminine Essence Narrative" in which he lists what he considers to be "the central tenets of the feminine essence theory", and then refutes each of these tenets:&lt;ref name = Blanchard2008/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

#Male-to-female transsexuals are, in some literal sense and not just in a figurative sense, women inside men’s bodies.
#There is only one type of woman, therefore there can be only one type of (true) male-to-female transsexual.
#Apparent differences among male-to-female transsexuals are relatively superficial and irrelevant to the basic unity of the transsexual syndrome.
#Male-to-female transsexuals have no unique, behavioral or psychological characteristics that are absent in typical men and women.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Neuroanatomic research==

According to Bailey and Triea,&lt;ref name=Bailey2007/&gt; one of the predictions based on the feminine essence theory is that male-to-female transsexuals would possess female rather than male brain anatomy. A widely cited research study of this topic examined the brain anatomy of six deceased male-to-female transsexuals, who had undergone during their lives hormonal treatment and surgical sex reassignment.&lt;ref name=Zhou1995&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zhou J. N. |author2=Hofman M. A. |author3=Gooren L. J. G. |author4=Swaab D. F. | year = 1995 | title = A sex difference in the human brain and its relation to transsexuality | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 378 | issue = 6552| pages = 68–70 | doi = 10.1038/378068a0 | pmid = 7477289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study reported that a brain structure called the "central subdivision of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis" (BSTc), which is larger in typical males than in typical females, was in the female range in the transsexual subjects. The interpretation and the methods of that study have been criticized,&lt;ref name=LawrenceWeb&gt;[http://www.annelawrence.com/twr/brain-sex_critique.html Transsexual women’s resources, by Dr. Anne Lawrence]&lt;/ref&gt; and the finding continues to be a matter of debate.

Neurological research has found that the brains of transsexuals differ in a number of ways.  For example, a study done on the brains of non-homosexual transsexuals using MRI and pheromones as stimuli found that transsexuals process smelling androgen and estrogen in the same way that women do. Previous research by the same team found that homosexual males also process smelling the pheromones of the sexes in a way that is similar to that of women.&lt;ref name="pheroMTF"&gt;[http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bhm216v1?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=1&amp;title=transsexual&amp;andorexacttitle=and&amp;andorexacttitleabs=and&amp;andorexactfulltext=and&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;sortspec=relevance&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT "Male-to-Female Transsexuals Show Sex-Atypical Hypothalamus Activation When Smelling Odorous Steroids"], by H. Berglund1,  P. Lindström2,  C. Dhejne-Helmy3 and  I. Savic2, Cerebral Cortex&lt;/ref&gt;   Work done by [[Simon LeVay]] had previously found that the hypothalamus of homosexual males has a region which is similar in size to that of heterosexual females.&lt;ref name="levay"&gt;[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/scotts/bulgarians/nature-nurture/levay.html A Difference in Hypothalmic Structure Between Heterosexual and Homosexual Men Simon LeVay]&lt;/ref&gt;  This is not so in non-homosexual males.&lt;ref name="levay"/&gt; Last but not least a study done by Hilleke E Hulshoff Pol reached the conclusion that the brain does change in overall volume and the volume of its parts with the use of cross-sex hormone supplements.&lt;ref name="CSCB"&gt;[http://www.eje-online.org/cgi/content/abstract/155/suppl_1/S107 Changing your sex changes your brain: influences of testosterone and estrogen on adult human brain structure] Hilleke E Hulshoff Pol,  Peggy T Cohen-Kettenis1,  Neeltje E M Van Haren,  Jiska S Peper, Rachel G H Brans,  Wiepke Cahn,  Hugo G Schnack,  Louis J G Gooren2 and  René S Kahn&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of male-to-female transsexuals, the brain assumes the proportions of a female brain.&lt;ref name="CSCB"/&gt;

==Other findings==

The main support for the feminine essence narrative is that many male-to-female transsexuals say they feel it to be true; many autobiographical and clinical accounts by or about transsexual individuals contain variations of the statement of having a female soul or needing to make the external body resemble the inner or true self.&lt;ref name=Brown1996&gt;Brown, M. L., &amp; Rounsley, C. A. (1996). ''True selves: Understanding transsexualism.'' San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ettner1999&gt;Ettner, R. (1999). ''Gender loving care: A guide to counseling gender-variant clients.'' New York: W. W. Norton.{{ISBN|0393703045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of this narrative consider it to be inconsistent with their research findings.  Blanchard has reported finding that there are two, and not one, types of male-to-female transsexual and that they differ with regard to their sexual interests, whether they were overtly gender atypical in childhood, how easily they pass as female, the ages at which they decide to transition to female, birth order, and their physical height and weight.&lt;ref name=Blanchard1990&gt;Blanchard, R., &amp; Steiner, B. W. (1990). ''Clinical management of gender identity disorders in children and adults.'' Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Press. {{ISBN|0-88048-187-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith2005a&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Smith Y. L. S.|author2= van Goozen S. H. M.|author3= Kuiper A.

==Role of medical community==

Since the medical community has guidelines for what types of individuals qualify for [[sex reassignment surgery]], transsexual persons sometimes adopt and tell the story that they believe will best help them qualify – the "feminine essence narrative" – and representing themselves as "essentially female", which may explain at least part of the prevalence of the feminine essence narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Terminology==

The phrase "feminine soul enclosed in a male body" (''anima muliebris in corpore virili inclusa'') was introduced in 1868 by [[Karl-Heinrich Ulrichs]], not to describe male-to-female transsexuals, none of whom existed yet as such, but to describe a type of gay men who self-identified as feminine.&lt;ref name=Ulrichs1868&gt;Ulrichs, Karl-Heinrich (1868).

The '''Great Transition''' is a term used by the Great Transition Initiative and its predecessor, the [[Global Scenario Group]] (GSG), to describe a vision of a just and sustainable global future. The term was originally coined by [[Kenneth E. Boulding]] in ''The Meaning of the 20th Century – The Great Transition'' (1964) and describes the shift from [[Pre-Modern|pre-modern]] to post-modern culture, and the four possible courses of action that these organizations believe will allow humanity to successfully manage the Great Transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=u8YSAAAACAAJ}}|title=The Meaning of the 20th Century: The Great Transition|last=Boulding|first=Kenneth Ewart|publisher=University Press of America|year=1988|isbn=978-0-8191-7102-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Elements of the Great Transition vision include egalitarian social and ecological values, increased inter-human connectivity, improved [[quality of life]], and a healthy planet, as well as the absence of poverty, war and environmental destruction. The Great Transition concept was cited by [[List of Prime Ministers of Bhutan|Prime Minister of Bhutan]] [[Jigme Thinley]],&lt;ref&gt;Jigme Thinly, [http://www.cabinet.gov.bt/?page_id=207 "Address by the Prime Minister on Well-Being and Happiness,"] UN Headquarters, New York, April 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Josh Ryan-Collins of the [[New Economics Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;Josh Ryan-Collins, [http://www.neweconomics.org/publications/entry/the-great-transition ''Great Transition''] (London: New Economics Foundation, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; and the Capital Institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cisymposium.com/ The Capital Institute Symposium: "Beyond Sustainability: The Road to Regenerative Capitalism] New York, June 20–21, 2013, &lt;/ref&gt; It was used as a theme for the 2011 SmartCSOs conference on strategies for Civil Society Organisations in London.&lt;ref&gt;SmartCSOs, [http://www.veblen-institute.org/Effective-change-strategies-for ''Effective Change Strategies for the Great Transition: Five Leverage Points for Civil Society Organisations''] Berlin: Smart CSOs, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Great Transition was first introduced by the [[Global Scenario Group]] (GSG), an international body of scientists convened in 1995 by the [[Tellus Institute]] and [[Stockholm Environment Institute]] to examine the requirements for a transition to a sustainable global society. The GSG set out to describe and analyze scenarios for the future of the earth as it entered a [[planetary phase of civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.gsg.org/gsgpub.html and Paul Raskin, Tariq Banuri, Gilberto Gallopín, Pablo Gutman, Al Hammond, Robert Kates, and Rob Swart, [http://www.greattransition.org/gt-essay ''Great Transition: The Promise and Lure of the Times Ahead''] (Boston: Stockholm Environment Institute, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Great Transition Initiative==

Further development of Great Transition scenarios is carried on by the [[Great Transition Initiative]] (GTI). Launched in 2003, GTI is a global network of several hundred scholars, intellectuals, civil society leaders, and activists working to develop visions and pathways for a “Great Transition" to a future of equity, solidarity and ecological sustainability. The Initiative was relaunched as an online journal and discussion network in 2014.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19793">'''Hip hop studies''' is a multidisciplinary field of study that encompasses sociology, anthropology, communication and rhetoric studies, religious studies, [[cultural studies]], [[critical race theory]], [[Missiology|missiological studies]], [[art history]], [[dance]], [[musicology]], [[ethnomusicology]], [[music theory]], and [[gender studies]].&lt;ref name=JHHS2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Monica|last2=Hodge|first2=Daniel White|last3=Coleman|first3=Jeffery|last4=Chaney|first4=Cassandra|title=The Hip in Hip Hop: Toward a Discipline of Hip Hop Studies|journal=Journal of Hip Hop Studies|date=2014|volume=1|issue=1|url=http://savethekidsgroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/JHHS-Volume-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "hip hop studies" began circulating in the mid-2000s, and though it is not clear who first coined the term to label the field, the field of hip hop studies is oft cited as having been crystallized by the publication of ''That's the Joint!: The Hip Hop Studies Reader'' in 2003.&lt;ref name=TTJ2004&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Forman|editor1-first=Murray|editor2-last=Neal|editor2-first=Marc Anthony|title=That's the Joint: The Hip Hop Studies Reader|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0415969192|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''That's the Joint!'' includes approximately 25 years of scholarship, criticism, and journalism. The publication of this anthology was unprecedented, and highlights the evolving and continuous influence of  "one of the most creative and contested elements of global popular culture since its advent in the late 1970s."&lt;ref name=TTJ2004 /&gt; The publication of the first edition of ''That's the Joint!'' marked a consolidating moment for the field of hip hop studies because it brought together key writings on hip hop from a diversity of hip hop authorities.&lt;ref name=TTJ2004 /&gt;

[[Hip hop culture]], rooted in the 1970s post-industrial South Bronx, is polyvocal and is represented in five cultural modes: [[rap music]] (oral), [[turntablism]] or "[[DJing]]" (aural), [[B-boying|breaking]] (physical), [[graffiti]] art (visual), and knowledge (mental).&lt;ref name=JHHS2014 /&gt; Hip hop has, and continues to produce a remarkable array of thinkers who embody complex ideological makeups exemplified through their performances as writers, artists, poets, and scholars.&lt;ref name=HHMatters2005&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watkins|first1=S.

From spoken-word artists to academic scholars hip-hop intellectuals are translating the movement into a vast mix of critical commentary and artistic expression. The results both energize and expand the image and imagination of the hip-hop intelligentsia."&lt;ref name="hip-hop intelligentsia" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Hip hop studies is part of the larger [[Hip hop|hip hop movement]].&lt;ref name=HHMatters2005 /&gt; The research and teaching in this interdisciplinary field includes analyses of technology, pop culture, linguistics, globalization, geography, race, electoral politics, and a variety of aspects related to contemporary culture, as scholars attempt to critically assess hip hop as a movement.&lt;ref name=HHMatters2005 /&gt; Scholarship in hip hop studies is rooted in the foundational, Afro-diasporic [[Call and response (music)|call-and-response]] mechanism within hip hop culture.&lt;ref name=ForemanInterview&gt;{{cite news|last1=Forman|first1=Murray|title='That's The Joint': A Scholarly Study of Hip-Hop|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4458410|accessdate=26 April 2015|agency=NPR|date=19 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodologies ==
{{Quote|text=The methodologies of examining hip hop are borrowed from sociology, politics, religion, economics, urban studies, journalism, communications theory, American studies, transatlantic studies, black studies, history, musicology, comparative literature, English, linguistics, and other disciplines.|sign=[[Michael Eric Dyson]]|source=''[https://www.amazon.com/Know-What-Mean-Reflections-Hip-Hop/dp/0465018076 Know What I Mean?: Reflections on Hip-Hop]''(2007)}}

Hip hop studies' [[methodologies]], or methods of systematic inquiry and analysis, are drawn from a range of academic disciplines including anthropology, sociology, political science, history, linguistics, economics, performance studies, media and communicative studies, American studies, musicology, English and literature, women's and gender studies, and black studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dyson|first1=Michael Eric|title=Know What I Mean? Reflections on Hip Hop|date=2010|publisher=Basic Civitas Books|location=New York|url=https://www.amazon.com/Know-What-Mean-Reflections-Hip-Hop/dp/0465018076}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greg Dimitriadis, formerly a professor in the Graduate School of Education at the University of Buffalo, was an academic who critically examined, amongst other topics, hip hop methodologies; writing "Questions of method are, at heart, questions about how one can best understand the world."&lt;ref name=Dimitriadis2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dimitriadis|first1=Greg|title=Framing Hip Hop: New Methodologies for New Times|journal=Urban Education|date=2015|volume=50|issue=1|pages=31–51|doi=10.1177/0042085914563185}}&lt;/ref&gt; In hip hop studies, this "world" encompasses the complexities of political, social, and economic exploitation of marginalized peoples, and hip hop practitioners'  resultant forms of resistant expression,&lt;ref name=Rose1994 /&gt; thus the frames of analysis used by scholars are equally complex and consider factors such as race, class, gender, gender identity, sexuality, location, and performance and performativity.&lt;ref name=Dimitriadis2015 /&gt; The use of [[ethnography]] is popular and preferred in hip hop studies because it is a mode of inquiry that enables a scholar to include a multiplicity of voices, and showcases the experiential knowledges of hip hop doers and consumers; ideally this method highlights the dual authority of practitioners' and academics' knowledges.&lt;ref name=Dimitriadis2015 /&gt;

== Foundational texts ==
Hip Hop studies has been growing as an academic discipline since the mid-1990s; two decades after its genesis. By the millennium and in the early 2000s, scholars such as [[Tricia Rose]], [[Michael Eric Dyson]], [[Cornel West]], [[Anthony B. Pinn]], [[Jeff Chang (journalist)|Jeff Chang]], [[Nelson George]], Bakari Kitwana, [[Mark Anthony Neal]], and Murray Forman, began engage Hip Hop's history, messages of resistance, social cognizance, personal awareness, political activism, pleasure and power, and community engagement in scholarly works that gave Hip Hop academic legitimacy.&lt;ref name=JHHS2014 /&gt;  Works by these authors are considered foundational texts in the field of Hip Hop studies because their research and publication served to legitimate Hip Hop as serious academic endeavor and since 2002 scholarly inquiry centralizing Hip Hop culture has multiple exponentially; exemplified by the inception of the [http://hiphoparchive.org Hip Hop Archive &amp; Research Institute at Harvard] in 2002,&lt;ref name=HHArchive@Harvard&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drake|first1=DJ Bobby|title=Hip Hop Archive &amp; Research Institute|url=http://hiphoparchive.org|website=Hip Hop Archive|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the publication of the second edition of ''That's the Joint!: The Hip Hop Studies Reader'' in 2011.&lt;ref name=TTJ2011&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Forman|editor1-first=Murray|editor2-last=Neal|editor2-first=Marc Anthony|title=That's the Joint!: The Hip Hop Studies Reader|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tricia Rose's ''Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary America '' (1994) ===
Discussions of scholarly writing on hip hop in the academia often begin with Tricia Rose's ''Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary America'', published in 1994. This book is categorized within hip hop studies as being among the most important early full-length texts on rap and hip hop culture, which helped to establish hip hop studies as a legitimate field of scholarly inquiry.&lt;ref name=Woldu2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woldu|first1=Gail Hilson|title=The Kaleidoscope of Writing on Hip-Hop Culture|journal=Notes|date=1 September 2010|volume=67|issue=1|pages=9–38|doi=10.1353/not.2010.0031}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2 April 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Rose's book gives a comprehensive account of the evolutionary history of hip hop culture. In Rose's words, ''Black Noise'' "examines the complex and contradictory relationships between forces of racial and sexual domination, black cultural priorities, and popular resistance in contemporary rap music,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rose|first1=Tricia|title=Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary America|date=1994|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Introduction|page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; while it outlines the social context of rap's existence. To achieve this analysis, Rose's includes a range of voices and perspectives by using an ethnographic approach; conducting interviews with hip hop performers and practitioners, as well as hip hop listeners and consumers.&lt;ref name=Rose1994&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rose|first1=Tricia|title=Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary America|date=1994|publisher=Wesleyan University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rose's interviews were conducted throughout the United States, as well as in Hong Kong, China, and Japan.&lt;ref name=Rose1994 /&gt; Rose's groundbreaking work continues to be referenced as a foundational text by contemporary scholars because its detailed documentation of hip hop culture's revolution employs [[ethnography]], cultural theory, urban history and historiography, as well as [[Black feminism|black feminist thought]]; culminating in an extensive bibliography.&lt;ref name=Woldu2010 /&gt;

=== Jeff Chang's ''Can't Stop, Won't Stop: A History of the Hip-Hop Generation'' (2005) ===
Jeff Chang's comprehensive examination of hip hop, ''Can't Stop, Won't Stop: A History of the Hip-Hop Generation'', received the American Book Award after its publication in 2005 and is often cited by hip hop cultural critics, hip hop journalists, popular-culture scholars, and hip hop academics.&lt;ref name=Chang2005&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chang|first1=Jeff|title=Can't Stop Won't Stop: A History of the Hip-Hop Generation|date=2005|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=0-312-42579-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chang situates hip hop as "forged in the fires of the Bronx and Kingston, Jamaica,"&lt;ref name=Chang2005BACK&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chang|first1=Jeff|title=Can't Stop, Won't Stop: A History of the Hip-Hop Generation|date=2005|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=0-312-42579-1|page=Rear Cover Text}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggests that "hip-hop has been a generation-defining global movement," &lt;ref name=Chang2005BACK /&gt; shaped by the deindustrialization and globalization of the post-civil rights era.&lt;ref name=Chang2005 /&gt; Chang's method of inquiry and analysis hybrids statistical, historical, and ehtnographical data with a casual writing style that includes Chang's opinions, sections of extended dialogue, and interviews.&lt;ref name=Chang2005 /&gt; Chang's central themes in this text are race, and the intersections of race in hip hop agendas/politics.&lt;ref name=Chang2005 /&gt;

== College/university programs and degrees ==

[[Howard University]], a [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically black college]], was the first to offer a Hip Hop-specific class to students in 1991.&lt;ref name="ACADEMICYES2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/ACADEMIC-HIP-HOP-YES-YES-Y-ALL-2613595.php|title=ACADEMIC HIP-HOP? YES, YES Y'ALL.|last1=Harmanci|first1=Reyham|date=2007|website=SF Gate|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the proceeding two decades, colleges across the United States have begun to offer a variety of courses specifically about Hip Hop culture; these include top-ranked universities, such as [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State]], [[University of Southern California|USC]], [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]], [[Rice University|Rice]], [[Duke University|Duke]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], and [[New York University|NYU]].&lt;ref name=JHHS2014 /&gt; Additionally, in 2012, the [[University of Arizona]] announced the implementation of a Hip Hop studies minor; the first of its kind in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wasserman|first1=Bonnie|title=Announcing a New Minor in Africana Studies with Concentration in Hip-Hop Cultures at the U of A!|url=http://africana.arizona.edu/news-events/announcing-new-minor-africana-studies-concentration-hip-hop-cultures-u|website=The University of Arizona: College of Humanities Africana Studies|accessdate=5 March 2015|date=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the University of Arizona's minor is the first interdisciplinary Hip Hop studies concentration of its kind, since 2009 at [[McNally Smith College of Music]] in St. Paul, Minnesota students can acquire a diploma in Hip Hop studies that focuses on Hip Hop music technique, music and audio production, and music industry economics and marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diploma: Hip-Hop Studies|url=http://www.mcnallysmith.edu/diplomas/hip-hop-studies|website=McNally Smith College of Music|accessdate=5 March 2015|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013 [[Tiffin University]] in Ohio began offering a music performance degree for students with primary focus in emceeing and beatmaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://polarentllc.com/producer-j-rawls-joins-tiffin-university-team/|title=Producer J Rawls Joins Tiffin University Team  Polar Ent LLC|website=polarentllc.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tiffin.edu/promusic|title=Professional Music|last=University|first=Tiffin|website=Tiffin University|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from classes and degree programs, development in the field has also been marked by the proliferation of conferences (domestically and internationally), symposiums, the development of readers and anthological texts, the establishment of the Hip Hop Archive and Research Institute at Harvard—each characteristic of a growing interest in and engagement with Hip Hop culture in academic discourse. In 2017, the top three universities to study Hip Hop at were [[McNally Smith College of Music]], [[North Carolina Central University]], and [[University of Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.campustales.com/281/top-3-universities-to-study-hip-hop-music|title=Top 3 Universities to Study Hip Hop Music|work=CampusTales|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critiques and critics ==

Hip Hop studies has not grown without critics, both within and outside the field. Davey D. (also known as: David Cook), a Bronx native and Hip Hop journalist, historian, adjunct professor, and community activist, has written and verbalized critiques of academic Hip Hop claiming that the narrow standards that define legitimate scholarly inquiry exclude individuals who do Hip Hop, in favor of published academics who may or may not have any lived or tangible connection to Hip Hop culture at all.&lt;ref name=ACADEMICYES2007 /&gt; In an article published by the ''San Francisco Globe'' in March 2007, Davey D. is quoted as saying: "You have an interesting phenomenon, where the 'hip-hop experts,' with university appointments attached to their name, have no credibility whatsoever in hip-hop circles. That, coupled with the fact that academia in a lot of places has always kept a distinct separation between what goes on in community and what happens on campus, is a source of tension."&lt;ref name=ACADEMICYES2007 /&gt; 
Hip hop's complex foundations have fostered a divergence of opinion amongst scholars regarding how writing on hip hop culture should be done.&lt;ref name=Woldu2010 /&gt; Namely, this debate is centralized around questions of language, and for what audience(s) scholars should be writing to address: the academic and/or scholar, the dilettante, or the fan and/or self-self-proccalimed "hip hop head."&lt;ref name=Woldu2010 /&gt; Since approximately 1988, three categories of writing on hip hop culture have emerged: works by academics, works by journalists and cultural critics, and works by hip-hop devotees; critiques of hip hop studies include questions of which kind of writing is considered authentic or legitimate within the field, and the accessibility that outsiders, or non-academics, would have to those texts, both physically and comprehensively.&lt;ref name=Woldu2010 /&gt;
Other critics, such as [[Alex Beam]] a columnist for ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', have claimed that the study of Hip Hop is unsuitable for critical academic study, citing the "celebration of ignorance, gangster-ism...and violence against women,"&lt;ref name=alexbeam&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beam|first1=Alex|title=Meet the rap-ademics|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2010/12/14/the_ivy_league_offers_its_esteemed_interpretation_of_hip_hop_lyrics/?p1=Features_link11|accessdate=5 March 2015|agency=Boston Globe|publisher=Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC|date=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in mainstream rap and Hip Hop.&lt;ref name=alexbeam /&gt;

Despite the critiques previously mentioned, not all critics of Hip Hop studies are trying to point out the perceived flaws as ways to invalidate its place in academia. Hip Hop feminists and feminism offer critics of Hip Hop studies from a perspective which adds another facet to Hip Hop studies, one that not only involves but gives a platform and amplifies the voice of Black and Latinx women and the LGBTQ+ community as they face the most erasure in the world of Hip Hop studies, even though they were there from the very start. Published books such as ''Home Girls Make Some Noise: Hip Hop Feminism Anthology''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/123957643|title=Home girls make some noise : hip-hop feminism anthology|date=2007|publisher=Parker Publishing, LLC|others=Pough, Gwendolyn D., 1970-, Neal, Mark Anthony., Morgan, Joan.|isbn=1600430104|edition=First|location=Mira Loma, Calif.|oclc=123957643}}&lt;/ref&gt;'', is'' an anthology that features journals, poetry, and articles by both women of color and LGBTQ+ community which depict where Hip Hop began and the direction in which it very well may go.

[[File:Printing3 Walk of Ideas Berlin.JPG|thumb|''Birthday Book Printing'', the fourth of the six [[Walk of Ideas]] sculptures displayed in [[Berlin]] during 2006, represents a pile of modern [[codex]] books.]]

The '''history of books''' starts with the [[History of writing|development of writing]], and various other inventions such as [[paper]] and [[printing]], and continues through to the modern day business of [[book printing]]. The earliest history of books actually predates what would conventionally be called "books" today and begins with tablets, scrolls, and sheets of [[papyrus]]. Then hand-bound, expensive, and elaborate books known as [[codices]] appeared. These gave way to [[printing press|press-printed]] volumes and eventually lead to the mass printed tomes prevalent today. Contemporary books may even have no physical presence with the advent of the [[e-book]]. The book also became more accessible to the disabled with the advent of [[Braille]] and spoken books.

== Clay tablets ==
[[File:Tablet describing goddess Inanna's battle with the mountain Ebih, Sumerian - Oriental Institute Museum, University of Chicago - DSC07117.JPG|thumb|[[Sumer]]ian [[clay tablet]], currently housed in the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute]] at the [[University of Chicago]], inscribed with the text of the poem ''[[Inanna#Justice myths|Inanna and Ebih]]'' by the priestess [[Enheduanna]], the first author whose name is known&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roberta Binkley|title=Rhetoric before and beyond the Greeks|year=2004|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791460993|pages=47|chapter=Reading the Ancient Figure of Enheduanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Clay tablets were used in [[Mesopotamia]] in the 3rd millennium BC. The calamus, an instrument in the form of a triangle, was used to make characters in moist clay. People used to use fire to dry the tablets out. At [[Nineveh]], over 20,000 tablets were found, dating from the 7th century BC; this was the archive and library of the kings of [[Assyria]], who had workshops of copyists and conservationists at their disposal. This presupposes a degree of organization with respect to books, consideration given to conservation, classification, etc. Tablets were used right up until the 19th century in various parts of the world, including Germany, Chile, Philippines and the Saharan Desert.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 122" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/educator/modules/gutenberg/books/early/|title=Early Writing|website=www.hrc.utexas.edu|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cuneiform and Sumerian Writing ===
Writing originated as a form of record keeping in Sumer during the fourth millennium BCE with the advent of cuneiform. Many clay tablets have been found that show cuneiform writing used to record legal contracts, create lists of assets, and eventually to record Sumerian literature and myths. Scribal schools have been found by archaeologists from as early as the second millennium BCE where students were taught the art of writing.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons 2011, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

== Papyrus ==
{{Main|Papyrus}}
[[File:Egypt.Papyrus.01.jpg|thumb|left|Egyptian Papyrus]]

After extracting the marrow from the stems of '''Papyrus reed''', a series of steps (humidification, pressing, drying, gluing, and cutting) produced media of variable quality, the best being used for sacred writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lib.umich.edu/papyrology-collection/how-ancient-papyrus-was-made|title=How Ancient Papyrus Was Made {{!}} U-M Library|website=www.lib.umich.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ancient Egypt]], papyrus was used as a medium for writing surfaces, maybe as early as from [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]], but first evidence is from the account books of King [[Neferirkare Kakai]] of the [[Fifth Dynasty]] (about 2400 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Leila Avrin. ''Scribes, Script and Books. The Book Arts from Antiquity to the Renaissance''. American Library Association / The British Library 1991, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; A calamus, the stem of a reed sharpened to a point, or bird feathers were used for writing. The script of Egyptian [[scribes]] was called [[hieratic]], or sacerdotal writing; it is not [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic]], but a simplified form more adapted to manuscript writing (hieroglyphs usually being engraved or painted). Egyptians exported papyrus to other Mediterranean civilizations including Greece and Rome where it was used until parchment was developed.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons 2011, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Papyrus]] books were in the form of a [[scroll]] of several sheets pasted together, for a total length of 10 meters or more.  Some books, such as the history of the reign of [[Ramses III]], were over 40 meters long. Books rolled out horizontally; the text occupied one side, and was divided into columns. The title was indicated by a label attached to the cylinder containing the book. Many papyrus texts come from tombs, where prayers and sacred texts were deposited (such as the [[Book of the Dead]], from the early 2nd millennium BC).

[[File:Bamboo book - binding - UCR.jpg|thumb|upright|A Chinese bamboo book]]

Before the introduction of books, writing on [[Oracle bone|bone]], shells, [[Bamboo and wooden slips|wood]] and [[silk]] was prevalent in [[China]] long before the 2nd century BC, until [[paper]] was invented in China around the 1st century AD. China's first recognizable books, called jiance or jiandu, were made of rolls of thin split and dried bamboo bound together with hemp, silk, or leather.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons 2011, 18&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of the process using the bark of the blackberry bush to create paper is attributed to [[Cai Lun|Ts'ai Lun]] (the cousin of Kar-Shun), but it may be older.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipst.gatech.edu/amp/collection/museum_invention_paper.htm|title=Invention of Paper|website=www.ipst.gatech.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Texts were reproduced by [[woodblock printing]]; the diffusion of Buddhist texts was a main impetus to large-scale production. The format of the book evolved with intermediate stages of scrolls folded [[concertina]]-style, scrolls bound at one edge ("butterfly books") and so on.

Although there is no exact date known, between 618 and 907 AD–The period of the Tang Dynasty–the first printing of books started in China.&lt;ref name=mcd&gt;{{cite book|last=McDermott|first=Joseph P.|title=A social history of the Chinese book: Books and literati culture in late imperial China|year=2006|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|location=Hong Kong|isbn=978-962-209-782-7|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ancientpages.com/2017/09/25/ancient-romans-invented-first-bound-book/|title=Ancient Romans Invented The First Bound Book {{!}} Ancient Pages|date=2017-09-25|work=Ancient Pages|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest extant printed book is a work of the [[Diamond Sutra]] and dates back to 868 AD, during the Tang Dynasty.&lt;ref name=mcd /&gt; The Diamond Sutra was printed by method of [[woodblock printing]], a strenuous method in which the text to be printed would be carved into a woodblock's surface, essentially to be used to stamp the words onto the writing surface medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://open.lib.umn.edu/mediaandculture/chapter/3-2-history-of-books/|title=3.2 History of Books {{!}} Understanding Media and Culture: An Introduction to Mass Communication|website=open.lib.umn.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woodblock printing was a common process for the reproduction of already handwritten texts during the earliest stages of book printing. This process was incredibly time-consuming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://education.asianart.org/explore-resources/background-information/invention-woodblock-printing-tang-618%E2%80%93906-and-song-960%E2%80%931279|title=The Invention of Woodblock Printing in the Tang (618–906) and Song (960–1279) Dynasties|work=Asian Art Museum {{!}} Education|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the meticulous and time-consuming process that woodblock printing was, [[Bi Sheng]], a key contributor to the history of printing, invented the process of [[Movable type|movable type printing]] (1041-1048 AD).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://education.asianart.org/explore-resources/background-information/invention-woodblock-printing-tang-618%E2%80%93906-and-song-960%E2%80%931279|title=The Invention of Woodblock Printing in the Tang (618–906) and Song (960–1279) Dynasties|work=Asian Art Museum {{!}} Education|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.silk-road.com/artl/movableprt.shtml|title=The Invention of Movable Type|last=Lee|first=Silkroad Foundation, Adela C.Y.|website=www.silk-road.com|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bi Sheng developed a printing process in which written text could be copied with the use of formed character types, the earliest types being made of [[ceramic]] or clay material.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The method of movable type printing would later become improved by [[Johannes Gutenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/press.html|title=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/press.html|website=www.historyguide.org|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pre-columbian codices of the Americas ==
[[File:Dresden codex, page 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dresden Codex]] (page 49)]]

In Mesoamerica, information was recorded on long strips of paper, agave fibers, or animal hides, which were then folded and protected by wooden covers.  These were thought to have existed since the time of the Classical Period between the 3rd and 8th centuries, CE.  Many of these codices were thought to contain astrological information, religious calendars, knowledge about the gods, genealogies of the rulers, cartographic information, and tribute collection.  Many of these codices were stored in temples but were ultimately destroyed by the Spanish explorers.&lt;ref&gt;Suarez, M.E. &amp; Wooudhuysen, H.R. (2013). The book: A global history. Oxford, Oxford University Press. Pages 656–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the only completely deciphered pre-Columbian writing system is the [[Maya script]].  The Maya, along with [[Mesoamerican writing systems|several]] other cultures in [[Mesoamerica]], constructed concertina-style books written on [[Amate]] paper. Nearly all Mayan texts were [[Diego de Landa|destroyed]] by the Spanish during colonization on cultural and religious grounds.  One of the few surviving examples is the [[Dresden Codex]].&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/pt/item/11621/ |title = O Códice de Dresden |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1200–1250 |accessdate = 2013-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although only the Maya have been shown to have a writing system capable of conveying any concept that can be conveyed via speech (at about the same level as the modern [[Japanese writing system]]), other [[Mesoamerican]] cultures had more rudimentary [[Ideogram|ideographical writing systems]] which were contained in similar concertina-style books, one such example being the [[Aztec codices]].

=== Florentine Codex ===
There are more than 2,000 illustrations drawn by native artists that represent this era. Bernardino de Sahagun tells the story of Aztec people’s lives and their natural history. The Florentine Codex speaks about the culture religious cosmology and ritual practices, society, economics, and natural history of the Aztec people. The manuscript are arranged in both the Nahuatl language and in Spanish. The English translation of the complete Nahuatl text of all twelve volumes of the Florentine Codex took ten years. Arthur J.O. Anderson and Charles Dibble had a decade of long work but made it an important contribution to Mesoamerican ethnohistory. Years later, in 1979, the Mexican government published a full-color volume  of the Florentine Codex. Now, since 2012, it is available digitally and fully accessible to those interested in Mexican and Aztec History.

The Florentine Codex is a 16th century ethnographic research study brought about by the Spanish Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagun. The codex itself was actually named ''La Historia Universal de las Cosas de Nueva España.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/516552.|title=Project MUSE|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernardino de Sahagun worked on this project from 1545 up until his death in 1590. The Florentine Codex consist of twelve books. It is 2400 pages long but divided into the twelve books by categories such as; The Gods, Ceremonies, Omens, and other cultural aspects of Aztec people.

== Wax tablets ==
[[File:Herkulaneischer Meister 002b.jpg|thumb|right|Woman holding wax tablets in the form of the [[codex]]. Wall painting from [[Pompeii]], before 79 AD.]]

Romans used wax-coated wooden tablets or ''pugillares'' upon which they could write and erase by using a [[stylus]]. One end of the stylus was pointed, and the other was spherical. Usually these tablets were used for everyday purposes (accounting, notes) and for teaching writing to children, according to the methods discussed by [[Quintilian]] in his ''Institutio Oratoria'' X Chapter 3. Several of these tablets could be assembled in a form similar to a [[codex]]. Also the etymology of the word codex (block of wood) suggest that it may have developed from wooden wax tablets.&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Bischoff. ''Latin Palaeography: Antiquity and the Middle Ages'', Cambridge University Press 2003 [reprint], p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parchment ==
{{Main|Parchment}}

Parchment progressively replaced [[papyrus]].  Legend attributes its invention to [[Eumenes II]], the king of [[Pergamon]], from which comes the name "pergamineum," which became "parchment."  Its production began around the 3rd century BC.  Made using the skins of animals (sheep, cattle, donkey, antelope, etc.), parchment proved to be easier to conserve over time; it was more solid, and allowed one to erase text.  It was a very expensive medium because of the rarity of material and the time required to produce a document. [[Vellum]] is the finest quality of parchment.

=== Greece and Rome ===
The scroll of [[papyrus]] is called "volumen" in Latin, a word which signifies "circular movement," "roll," "spiral," "whirlpool," "revolution" (similar, perhaps, to the modern English interpretation of "swirl") and finally "a roll of writing paper, a rolled manuscript, or a book."
In the 7th century [[Isidore of Seville]] explains the relation between codex, book and scroll in his ''Etymologiae'' (VI.13) as this:
{{cquote|A codex is composed of many books (''librorum''); a book is of one scroll (''voluminis''). It is called codex by way of metaphor from the trunks (''caudex'') of trees or vines, as if it were a wooden stock, because it contains in itself a multitude of books, as it were of branches.}}

=== Description ===
The scroll is rolled around two vertical wooden axes.  This design allows only sequential usage; one is obliged to read the text in the order in which it is written, and it is impossible to place a marker in order to directly access a precise point in the text.  It is comparable to modern video cassettes.  Moreover, the reader must use both hands to hold on to the vertical wooden rolls and therefore cannot read and write at the same time.  The only volumen in common usage today is the Jewish [[Torah]].

=== Book culture ===
The authors of [[ancient history|Antiquity]] had no rights concerning their published works; there were neither authors' nor publishing rights.  Anyone could have a text recopied, and even alter its contents.  Scribes earned money and authors earned mostly glory, unless a patron provided cash; a book made its author famous.  This followed the traditional conception of the culture: an author stuck to several models, which he imitated and attempted to improve.  The status of the author was not regarded as absolutely personal.

From a political and religious point of view, books were censored very early: the works of [[Protagoras]] were burned because he was a proponent of [[agnosticism]] and argued that one could not know whether or not the gods existed. Generally, cultural conflicts led to important periods of book destruction: in 303, the emperor [[Diocletian]] ordered the burning of Christian texts.  Some [[Christians]] later burned libraries, and especially heretical or non-canonical Christian texts.  These practices are found throughout human history but have ended in many nations today.  A few nations today still greatly censor and even burn books.

But there also exists a less visible but nonetheless effective form of censorship when books are reserved for the elite; the book was not originally a medium for expressive liberty.  It may serve to confirm the values of a political system, as during the reign of the emperor [[Augustus]], who skillfully surrounded himself with great authors.  This is a good ancient example of the control of the media by a political power.  However, private and public censorship have continued into the modern era, albeit in various forms.

=== Proliferation and conservation of books in Greece ===
Little information concerning books in Ancient [[Greece]] survives.  Several vases (6th and 5th centuries BC) bear images of volumina.  There was undoubtedly no extensive trade in books, but there existed several sites devoted to the sale of books.

The spread of books, and attention to their cataloging and conservation, as well as literary criticism developed during the [[Hellenistic]] period with the creation of large libraries in response to the desire for knowledge exemplified by [[Aristotle]].  These libraries were undoubtedly also built as demonstrations of political prestige:
* The [[Library of Alexandria]], a library created by [[Ptolemy I|Ptolemy Soter]] and set up by [[Demetrius Phalereus]] (Demetrius of Phaleron). It contained 500,900 volumes (in the ''Museion'' section) and 40,000 at the Serapis temple (''Serapeion''). All books in the luggage of visitors to Egypt were inspected, and could be held for copying. The Museion was partially destroyed in 47 BC.
* The Library at [[Pergamon]], founded by [[Attalus I]]; it contained 200,000 volumes which were moved to the Serapeion by [[Mark Antony]] and [[Cleopatra]], after the destruction of the Museion. The Serapeion was partially destroyed in 391, and the last books disappeared in 641 CE following the [[Arab]] conquest.
* The Library at [[Athens]], the ''Ptolemaion'', which gained importance following the destruction of the [[Library at Alexandria]] ; the [[Library of Pantainos]], around 100 CE; the library of [[Hadrian]], in 132 CE.
* The Library at [[Rhodes]], a library that rivaled the [[Library of Alexandria]].
* The Library at [[Antioch]], a public library of which [[Euphorion of Chalcis]] was the director near the end of the 3rd century.

The libraries had copyist workshops, and the general organisation of books allowed for the following:
* Conservation of an example of each text
* Translation (the [[Septuagint]] [[Bible]], for example)
* Literary criticisms in order to establish reference texts for the copy (example : ''[[The Iliad]]'' and ''[[The Odyssey]]'')
* A catalog of books
* The copy itself, which allowed books to be disseminated

=== Book production in Rome ===
Book production developed in [[Rome]] in the 1st century BC with Latin literature that had been influenced by the Greek. Conservative estimates places the number of potential readers in Imperial Rome at around 100,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/19/books/review/Beard-t.html|title=Scrolling Down the Ages|last=Beard|first=Mary|date=April 16, 2009|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629200012/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/19/books/review/Beard-t.html|archive-date=June 29, 2017|dead-url=|quote=Imperial Rome had a population of at least a million. Using a conservative estimate of literacy levels, there would have been more than 100,000 readers in the city.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This diffusion primarily concerned circles of literary individuals.  [[Titus Pomponius Atticus|Atticus]] was the editor of his friend [[Cicero]].  However, the book business progressively extended itself through the [[Roman Empire]]; for example, there were bookstores in [[Lyon]].  The spread of the book was aided by the extension of the Empire, which implied the imposition of the [[Latin]] tongue on a great number of people (in Spain, Africa, etc.).

[[Library|Libraries]] were private or created at the behest of an individual. [[Julius Caesar]], for example, wanted to establish one in Rome, proving that libraries were signs of political prestige.

In the year 377, there were 28 libraries in Rome, and it is known that there were many smaller libraries in other cities. Despite the great distribution of books, scientists do not have a complete picture as to the literary scene in antiquity as thousands of books have been lost through time.

== Paper ==
{{Main|History of paper}}

Papermaking has traditionally been traced to China about AD 105, when [[Cai Lun]], an official attached to the Imperial court during the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC – 220 AD), created a sheet of paper using [[mulberry]] and other [[bast fibre]]s along with [[fishnets]], old rags, and [[hemp]] waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  |accessdate=2007-11-11
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While paper used for wrapping and padding was used in China since the 2nd century BC,&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 122"&gt;[[#Needham, V 1|Needham, V 1]], p.&amp;nbsp;122&lt;/ref&gt;  paper used as a writing medium only became widespread by the 3rd century.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 1"&gt;[[#Needham, V 1|Needham, V 1]]&lt;/ref&gt; By the 6th century in China, sheets of paper were beginning to be used for [[toilet paper]] as well.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 123"&gt;[[#Needham, V 1|Needham, V 1]], p.&amp;nbsp;123&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907 AD) paper was folded and sewn into square [[tea bag|bags]] to preserve the flavor of tea.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 122" /&gt; The [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279) that followed was the first government to issue [[banknote|paper currency]].

An important development was the mechanization of paper manufacture by [[Middle Ages|medieval]] papermakers. The introduction of water-powered [[paper mill]]s, the first certain evidence of which dates to the 11th century in Córdoba, Spain,&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Robert I.: "Paper comes to the West, 800–1400", in: Lindgren, Uta: ''Europäische Technik im Mittelalter. 800 bis 1400.

Papermaking centres began to multiply in the late 13th century in Italy, reducing the price of paper to one sixth of [[parchment]] and then falling further.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Robert I.: "Paper comes to the West, 800–1400", in: Lindgren, Uta: ''Europäische Technik im Mittelalter. 800 bis 1400. Tradition und Innovation'', 4th ed., Gebr. Mann Verlag, Berlin 1996, {{ISBN|3-7861-1748-9}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;413–422 (417)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Middle Ages ==
{{Main|Manuscript culture|Illuminated manuscript}}
[[File:Codex Manesse Ulrich von Singenberg.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[codex Manesse]]'', a book from the Middle Ages]]

By the end of antiquity, between the 2nd and 4th centuries, the [[scroll]] was replaced by the [[codex]]. The book was no longer a continuous roll, but a collection of sheets attached at the back.  It became possible to access a precise point in the text quickly.  The codex is equally easy to rest on a table, which permits the reader to take notes while he or she is reading.  The codex form improved with the separation of words, capital letters, and punctuation, which permitted silent reading.  Tables of contents and indices facilitated direct access to information.  This form was so effective that it is still the standard book form, over 1500 years after its appearance.

Paper would progressively replace parchment.  Cheaper to produce, it allowed a greater diffusion of books.

=== Books in monasteries ===
A number of Christian books were destroyed at the order of [[Diocletian]] in 304 AD. During the turbulent periods of the invasions, it was the monasteries that conserved religious texts and certain works of [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]] for the West.  But there would also be important copying centers in [[Byzantium]].

The role of monasteries in the conservation of books is not without some ambiguity:
* Reading was an important activity in the lives of monks, which can be divided into prayer, intellectual work, and manual labor (in the [[Benedictine]] order, for example).  It was therefore necessary to make copies of certain works.  Accordingly, there existed scriptoria (the plural of scriptorium) in many monasteries, where monks copied and decorated manuscripts that had been preserved.
* However, the conservation of books was not exclusively in order to preserve ancient culture; it was especially relevant to understanding religious texts with the aid of ancient knowledge.  Some works were never recopied, having been judged too dangerous for the monks.  Moreover, in need of blank media, the monks scraped off manuscripts, thereby destroying ancient works.  The transmission of knowledge was centered primarily on sacred texts.

Despite this ambiguity, monasteries in the West and the Eastern Empire permitted the conservation of a certain number of secular texts, and several libraries were created: for example, [[Cassiodorus]] ('Vivarum' in Calabria, around 550), or [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]] in [[Constantinople]].  There were several libraries, but the survival of books often depended on political battles and ideologies, which sometimes entailed massive destruction of books or difficulties in production (for example, the distribution of books during the [[Iconoclasm]] between 730 and 842).  A long list of very old and surviving libraries that now form part of the [[Vatican Archives]] can be found in the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]].

A very strong example of the early copying and conserving books is that of the [[Quran]]. After Muhammad, his companion Abu Bakr, on the recommendation of Umar Bin Alkhattab, assigned Zayd bin Saabit to compile the first official scripture of the Quran. Zayd collected all the available scriptures of the Quran scripted by different companions of Muhammad during his life. He compiled one scripture and got it verified by all the companions who had memorized the whole book while Muhammad was alive. Then this first official scripture was kept at the house of Hafsa, the wife of the Muhammad. By the time of the third caliph Uthmaan, the Islamic state had spread over a large portion of the known world. He ordered the preparation of the official copies of the first official scripture. The copies were duly verified for accuracy. These copies were sent to each city of the caliphate so that further copies can be made locally with the perfect accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Quran#Compilation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

To help preserve books and protect them from thieves, librarians would create [[Chained library|chained libraries]]. Chained Libraries were books displayed next to each other to create a tight bond. This eliminated unauthorised removal of books. One of the earliest chained libraries was in England during the 1500s. Popular culture also has examples of chained libraries, such as in [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]] by [[J.K Rowling]].

=== The ''scriptorium'' ===
The scriptorium was the workroom of monk copyists; here, books were copied, decorated, rebound, and conserved.  The armarius directed the work and played the role of librarian.

The role of the copyist was multifaceted: for example, thanks to their work, texts circulated from one monastery to another.  Copies also allowed monks to learn texts and to perfect their religious education.  The relationship with the book thus defined itself according to an intellectual relationship with [[God]].  But if these copies were sometimes made for the monks themselves, there were also copies made on demand.

The task of copying itself had several phases: the preparation of the manuscript in the form of notebooks once the work was complete, the presentation of pages, the copying itself, revision, correction of errors, decoration, and [[bookbinding|binding]].  The book therefore required a variety of competencies, which often made a manuscript a collective effort.

=== Transformation from the literary edition in the 12th century ===

[[File:Sandro Botticelli - The Virgin and Child (The Madonna of the Book) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|The scene in [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]]'s ''[[Madonna of the Book]]'' (1480) reflects the presence of books in the houses of richer people in his time.]]
The revival of cities in Europe would change the conditions of book production and extend its influence, and the monastic period of the book would come to an end.  This revival accompanied the intellectual renaissance of the period. The [[Manuscript culture]] outside of the monastery developed in these university-cities in Europe in this time.  It is around the first universities that new structures of production developed: reference manuscripts were used by students and professors for teaching [[theology]] and liberal arts.  The development of commerce and of the bourgeoisie brought with it a demand for specialized and general texts (law, history, novels, etc.).  It is in this period that writing in the common vernacular developed (courtly poetry, novels, etc.).  Commercial scriptoria became common, and the profession of book seller came into being, sometimes dealing internationally.

There is also the creation of royal [[libraries]] as in the case of [[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis]] and [[Charles V of France|Charles V]]. Books were also collected in private libraries, which became more common in the 14th and 15th centuries.

The use of paper diffused through Europe in the 14th century.  This material, less expensive than [[parchment]], came from China via the [[Arabs]] in Spain in the 11th and 12th centuries. It was used in particular for ordinary copies, while [[parchment]] was used for luxury editions.

== Printing press ==
{{Main|Printing press}}

The invention of the moveable type on the [[printing press]] by Johann Fust, Peter Schoffer and [[Johannes Gutenberg]] around 1440 marks the entry of the book into the industrial age.  The Western book was no longer a single object, written or reproduced by request.  The publication of a book became an enterprise, requiring capital for its realization and a market for its distribution. The cost of each individual book (in a large edition) was lowered enormously, which in turn increased the distribution of books.  The book in codex form and printed on paper, as we know it today, dates from the 15th century. Books printed before January 1, 1501, are called [[incunable]]s. The spreading of book printing all over Europe occurred relatively quickly, but most books were still printed in [[Latin]]. The spreading of the concept of printing books in the [[vernacular]] was a somewhat slower process.

== Contemporary era ==
During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] more books began to pour off European presses, creating an early form of information overload for many readers.  Nowhere was this more the case than in Enlightenment Scotland, where students were exposed to a wide variety of books during their education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=Natural History, Natural Philosophy and Readership|journal=The Edinburgh History of the Book in Scotland|year=2012|volume=2|pages=297–309|url=https://www.academia.edu/3770441/Natural_History_Natural_Philosophy_and_Readership_in_Stephen_Brown_and_Warren_McDougall_eds._The_Edinburgh_History_of_the_Book_in_Scotland_Vol._II_Enlightenment_and_Expansion_1707-1800_Edinburgh_University_of_Edinburgh_Press_2012_297-309}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The demands of the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] (founded 1804), the [[American Bible Society]] (founded 1816), and other non-denominational publishers for enormously large inexpensive runs of texts led to numerous innovations. The introduction of steam printing presses a little before 1820, closely followed by new steam paper mills, constituted the two most major innovations.  Together, they caused book prices to drop and the number of books to increase considerably.  Numerous bibliographic features, like the positioning and formulation of titles and subtitles, were also affected by this new production method.  New types of documents appeared later in the 19th century:  [[photography]], [[sound recording]] and [[film]].

[[Typewriter]]s and eventually computer based word processors and printers let people print and put together their own documents. [[Desktop publishing]] is common in the 21st century.

Among a series of developments that occurred in the 1990s, the spread of digital multimedia, which encodes texts, images, animations, and sounds in a unique and simple form was notable for the book publishing industry. [[Hypertext]] further improved access to information. Finally, the [[internet]] lowered production and distribution costs.

=== E-books and the future of the book ===
It is difficult to predict the future of the book in an era of fast-paced technological change.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Darnton]], ''The Case for Books: Past, Present and Future'', New York, Public Affairs, 2009. {{ISBN|978-1-58648-826-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Anxieties about the "death of books" have been expressed throughout the history of the medium, perceived as threatened by competing media such as radio, television, and the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O8xg8EfQnnAC|title=The Future of the Book|last=Nunberg|first=Geoffrey|date=1996-01-01|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-20451-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cpNtvB4YF2cC|title=This is Not the End of the Book: A Conversation Curated by Jean-Philippe de Tonnac|last=Carrière|first=Jean-Claude|last2=Eco|first2=Umberto|date=2012-05-01|publisher=Vintage|isbn=978-0-09-955245-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these views are generally exaggerated, and "dominated by fetishism, fears about the end of humanism and ideas of techno-fundamentalist progress".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ballatore|first=Andrea|last2=Natale|first2=Simone|date=2015-05-18|title=E-readers and the death of the book: Or, new media and the myth of the disappearing medium|url=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/05/18/1461444815586984|journal=New Media &amp; Society|pages=1461444815586984|doi=10.1177/1461444815586984|issn=1461-4448}}&lt;/ref&gt; The print book medium has proven to be very resilient and adaptable.

A good deal of reference material, designed for direct access instead of sequential reading, as for example [[encyclopedia]]s, exists less and less in the form of books and increasingly on the web. Leisure reading materials are increasingly published in e-reader formats.

Although electronic books, or e-books, had limited success in the early years, and readers were resistant at the outset, the demand for books in this format has grown dramatically, primarily because of the popularity of e-reader devices and as the number of available titles in this format has increased. Since the [[Amazon Kindle]] was released in 2007, the e-book has become a digital phenomenon and many theorize that it will take over hardback and paper books in future. E-books are much more accessible and easier to buy and it’s also cheaper to purchase an E-Book rather than its physical counterpart due to paper expenses being deducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teenink.com/opinion/current_events_politics/article/211256/Are-E-books-Taking-Over-the-Printed-World/|title=Are E-books Taking Over the Printed World? – Teen Politics Essay|website=www.teenink.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another important factor in the increasing popularity of the e-reader is its continuous diversification. Many e-readers now support basic operating systems, which facilitate email and other simple functions. The [[iPad]] is the most obvious example of this trend, but even mobile phones can host e-reading software.

== Reading for the blind ==
[[Braille]] is a system of reading and writing through the use of the finger tips. Braille was developed as a system of efficient communication for blind and partially blind alike.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://brailleworks.com/braille-resources/history-of-braille/|title=History of Braille - Braille Works|work=Braille Works|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system consists of sixty-three characters and is read left to right. These characters are made with small raised dots in two columns similar to a modern [[Dominoes|domino piece]] to represent each letter.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Braille-writing-system|title=Braille {{!}} writing system|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Readers can identify characters with two fingers. Reading speed averages one hundred and twenty-five words per minute and can reach two hundred words per minute.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== The making of Braille ===
Braille was named after its creator [[Louis Braille]] in 1824 in [[France]]. Braille stabbed himself in the eyes at the age of three with his father's leather working tools.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Braille spent nine years working on a previous system of communication called [[night writing]] by [[Charles Barbier]]. Braille published his book "procedure for writing words, music, and plainsong in dots", in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nfb.org/1829-braille-book|title=1829 Braille Book|date=2010-10-04|work=National Federation of the Blind|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1854 France made Braille the "official communication system for blind individuals".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; [[Valentin Haüy]] was the first person to put Braille on paper in the form of a book.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In 1932 Braille became accepted and used in English speaking countries.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In 1965 the Nemeth Code of Braille Mathematics and Scientific Notation was created. The code was developed to assign symbols to advanced mathematical notations and operations.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The system has remained the same, only minor adjustments have been made to it since its creation.

=== Spoken books ===
The spoken book was originally created in the 1930s to provide the blind and visually impaired with a medium to enjoy books. In 1932 the [[American Foundation for the Blind]] created the first recordings of spoken books on vinyl records.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.silksoundbooks.com/history-of-audiobooks.html|title=The History of the audiobooks|last=Silksoundbooks|website=www.silksoundbooks.com|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, a British based foundation, [[Royal National Institute of Blind People|Royal National Institute for the Blind]] (RNIB), was the first to deliver talking books to the blind on vinyl records.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Each record contained about thirty minutes of audio on both sides, and the records were played on a [[Phonograph|gramophone]]. Spoken books changed mediums in the 1960s with the transition from vinyl records to cassette tapes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/a-short-history-of-the-audiobook-20-years-after-the-first-portable-digital-audio-device|title=A short history of the audiobook, 20 years after the first portable digital audio device|website=PBS NewsHour|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next progression of spoken books came in the 1980s with the widespread use of compact discs. Compact discs reached more people and made it possible to listen to books in the car.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1995 the term [[audiobook]] became the industry standard.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Finally, the internet enabled audiobooks to become more accessible and portable. Audiobooks could now be played in their entirety instead of being split onto multiple disks.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Academic discipline==

[[File:Bucheinband.15.Jh.r.Inkunabel.jpg|thumb|right|A 15th-century [[Incunable]]. Notice the blind-tooled cover, corner bosses and clasps.]]
The history of the book as an [[academic discipline]] studies the production, transmission, circulation and dissemination of text from [[Ancient history|antiquity]] to the present day. Its scope includes the book as object, the [[history of ideas]], [[history of religion]], [[bibliography]], [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]], [[archiving|curation]] and the future of the book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sites.hps.cam.ac.uk/research/hb.html Johns, A. (1998) Research Guide: The History of the Book. Department of History and Philosophy of Science. University of Cambridge]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origins ===
The history of the book came into existence in the latter half of the 20th century. It was fostered by [[William Ivins Jr.]]'s ''Prints and Visual Communication'' (1953) and [[Henri-Jean Martin]] and [[Lucien Febvre]]'s ''L'apparition du livre'' (''The Coming of the Book: The Impact of Printing, 1450–1800'') in 1958 as well as [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s ''Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man'' (1962).  Another notable pioneer in the History of the Book is [[Robert Darnton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=I.R.Willison|url=http://sas-space.sas.ac.uk/8/1/July.pdf|title=The History of the Book as a Field of Study within the Humanities|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14308">Since prehistoric times,  significant changes in communication technologies (media and appropriate inscription tools) have evolved in tandem with shifts in political and economic systems, and by extension, systems of power. Communication can range from very subtle processes of exchange, to full conversations and mass communication. Human communication was revolutionized with the [[origin of speech]] approximately 500,000 BCE. Symbols were developed about 30,000 years ago.
The imperfection of speech, which nonetheless allowed easier dissemination of ideas and stimulated [[invention]]s, eventually resulted in the creation of new forms of communications, improving both the range at which people could communicate and the longevity of the information. All of those inventions were based on the key concept of the symbol.

The oldest known  symbols created for the purpose of communication were [[cave paintings]], a form of [[rock art]], dating to the [[Upper Paleolithic]] age. The oldest known cave painting is located within [[Chauvet Cave]], dated to around 30,000 [[Anno Domini|BC]].&lt;ref name="Paul Martin Lester"/&gt; These paintings contained increasing amounts of information: people may have created the first [[calendar]] as far back as 15,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="rappenglueck"/&gt; The connection between drawing and writing is further shown by [[linguistics]]: in  [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Ancient Greece]] the concepts and words of drawing and writing were one and the same (Egyptian: 's-sh', Greek: 'graphein').&lt;ref name="David Diringer BBP"/&gt;

==Petroglyphs==
{{Details|Petroglyphs}}
[[File:Haljesta.jpg|thumb|right|92x92px|Petroglyphs from [[Häljesta]], Sweden. Nordic [[Bronze Age]] ]]

The next advancement in the history of communications came with the production of [[petroglyph]]s, carvings into a rock surface. It took about 20,000 years for homo sapiens to move from the first cave paintings to the first petroglyphs, which are dated to approximately the Neolithic and late Upper Paleolithic boundary, about 10,000 to 12,000 years ago.

It is possible that humans of that time used some other forms of communication, often for [[mnemonic]] purposes - specially arranged stones, symbols carved in wood or earth, [[quipu]]-like ropes, [[tattoo]]s, but little other than the most durable carved stones has survived to modern times and we can only speculate about their existence based on our observation of still existing 'hunter-gatherer' cultures such as those of [[Africa]] or [[Oceania]].&lt;ref name="David Diringer HotA"/&gt;

==Pictograms==
{{Details|Pictograms}}
[[File:Piktograf1.png|thumb|right|150px|Pictograph from 1510 telling a story of coming of [[missionaries]] to [[Hispaniola]] ]]

A [[pictogram]] (pictograph) is a [[symbol]] representing a [[concept]], [[Object (philosophy)|object]], activity, place or event by [[illustration]]. Pictography is a form of [[proto-writing]] whereby [[idea]]s are transmitted through [[drawing]]. Pictographs were the next step in the evolution of communication: the most important difference between petroglyphs and pictograms is that petroglyphs are simply showing an event, but
pictograms are telling a story about the event, thus they can for example be ordered [[chronological]]ly.

Pictograms were used by various ancient [[culture]]s all over the world since around 9000&amp;nbsp;BC, when tokens marked with simple pictures began to be used to label basic farm produce, and become increasingly popular around 6000–5000&amp;nbsp;BC.

They were the basis of [[Cuneiform (script)|cuneiform]] &lt;ref name="Linguistics 201: The Invention of Writing"/&gt; and [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]], and began to develop into [[logogram|logographic]] [[writing system]]s around 5000&amp;nbsp;BC.

==Ideograms==
{{Details|Ideograms}}
[[File:Our Father in heaven - Mikmaq hierogl.gif|frame|right|The beginning of the Lord's Prayer in [[Míkmaq hieroglyphic writing]]. The text reads ''Nujjinen wásóq'' – "Our father / in heaven".]]

Pictograms, in turn, evolved into ideograms, graphical symbols that represent an [[idea]]. Their ancestors, the pictograms, could represent only something resembling their form: therefore a pictogram of a circle could represent a sun, but not concepts like 'heat', 'light', 'day' or 'Great God of the Sun'. Ideograms, on the other hand, could convey more abstract concepts, so that for example an ideogram of two sticks can mean not only 'legs' but also a verb 'to walk'.

Because some ideas are universal, many different cultures developed similar ideograms. For example, an eye with a tear means 'sadness' in [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] ideograms in [[California]], as it does for the [[Aztec]]s, the early [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] and the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]]. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Ideograms were precursors of [[logogram|logographic writing systems]] such as [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] and [[Chinese character]]s. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Examples of ideographical proto-writing systems, thought not to contain language-specific information, include the [[Vinca script]] (see also [[Tărtăria tablets]]) and the early [[Indus script]]. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} In both cases there are claims of decipherment of linguistic content, without wide acceptance. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Writing==
{{Details|History of writing}}
[[File:Sumerian 26th c Adab.jpg|thumb|250px|26th century&amp;nbsp;BC Sumerian [[cuneiform script]] in [[Sumerian language]], listing gifts to the high priestess of [[Adab (city)|Adab]] on the occasion of her election. One of the earliest examples of human [[writing]].]]

The oldest-known forms of writing were primarily [[logogram|logographic]] in nature, based on [[pictogram|pictographic]] and [[ideogram|ideographic]] elements. Most writing systems can be broadly divided into three categories: ''logographic'', ''syllabic'' and ''alphabetic'' (or ''segmental''); however, all three may be found in any given writing system in varying  proportions, often making it difficult to categorise a system uniquely.

The invention of the first [[writing system]]s is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]] in the late [[Neolithic]] of the late 4000&amp;nbsp;BC. The first writing system is generally believed to have been invented in pre-historic [[Sumer]] and developed by the late [[3rd millennium BC|3000's&amp;nbsp;BC]] into [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]]. [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], and the undeciphered [[Proto-Elamite]] writing system and [[Indus script|Indus Valley script]] also date to this era, though a few scholars have questioned the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]] script's status as a writing system.

The original Sumerian writing system was derived from a system of [[clay]] [[Token coin|tokens]] used to represent [[commodities]]. By the end of the 4th millennium&amp;nbsp;BC, this had evolved into a method of keeping [[Account (accountancy)|accounts]], using a round-shaped [[stylus]] impressed into soft clay at different angles for recording [[number]]s. This was gradually augmented with pictographic writing using a sharp stylus to indicate what was being counted. Round-stylus and sharp-stylus writing was gradually replaced about 2700–2000&amp;nbsp;BC by writing using a wedge-shaped stylus (hence the term [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]]), at first only for [[logogram]]s, but developed to include [[phonetic]] elements by the 2800&amp;nbsp;BC. About 2600&amp;nbsp;BC cuneiform began to represent syllables of spoken [[Sumerian language]].

Finally, cuneiform writing became a general purpose writing system for [[logogram]]s, [[syllable]]s, and numbers. By the 26th century&amp;nbsp;BC, this script had been adapted to another Mesopotamian language, [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], and from there to others such as [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]], and [[Hittite language|Hittite]]. Scripts similar in appearance to this writing system include those for [[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]] and [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]].

The [[Chinese script]] may have originated independently of the Middle Eastern scripts, around the 16th century&amp;nbsp;BC (early [[Shang Dynasty]]), out of a late neolithic Chinese system of proto-writing dating back to c. 6000&amp;nbsp;BC. The pre-Columbian writing systems of the [[Americas]], including [[Olmec]] and [[Maya script|Mayan]], are also generally believed to have had independent origins.

===Alphabet===
{{Details|History of the alphabet}}
[[File:A Specimen by William Caslon.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''A Specimen'' of typeset fonts and languages, by [[William Caslon]], letter founder; from the 1728 ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]''.]]

The first pure [[alphabet]]s (properly, "[[abjad]]s", mapping single symbols to single phonemes, but not necessarily each phoneme to a symbol) emerged around 2000&amp;nbsp;BC in [[Ancient Egypt]], but by then alphabetic principles had already been incorporated into [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s for a millennium (see [[Middle Bronze Age alphabets]]).

By 2700&amp;nbsp;BC, Egyptian writing had a set of some [[Egyptian hieroglyph#Uniliteral signs|22 hieroglyphs]] to represent syllables that begin with a single [[consonant]] of their language, plus a vowel (or no vowel) to be supplied by the native speaker. These glyphs were used as pronunciation guides for [[logogram]]s, to write grammatical inflections, and, later, to transcribe loan words and foreign names.

However, although seemingly alphabetic in nature, the original Egyptian uniliterals were not a system and were never used by themselves to encode Egyptian speech. In the [[Middle Bronze Age]] an apparently "alphabetic" system is thought by some to have been developed in central [[Egypt]] around 1700&amp;nbsp;BC for or by [[Semitic people|Semitic]] workers, but we cannot read these early writings and their exact nature remains open to interpretation.

Over the next five centuries this Semitic "alphabet" (really a [[syllabary]] like [[Phoenician writing]]) seems to have spread north. All subsequent alphabets around the world{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} with the sole exception of Korean [[Hangul]] have either descended from it, or been inspired by one of its descendants.

==History of telecommunication==
{{Details|History of telecommunication}}
The [[history of telecommunication]] - the [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signals]] over a distance for the purpose of [[communication]] - began thousands of years ago with the use of [[smoke signal]]s and [[drum (communication)|drums]] in [[Africa]], [[United States|America]] and parts of [[Asia]]. In the 1790s the first fixed [[Semaphore line|semaphore systems]] emerged in [[Europe]] however it was not until the 1830s that [[electrical]] [telecommunication] systems started to appear.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18737">{{main|Creativity}}
The ways in which societies have perceived the [[concept]] of [[creativity]] have changed throughout history, as has the [[terminology|term]] itself.  The [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] concept of art (in Greek, "''techne''" — the root of "technique" and "technology"), with the exception of poetry, involved not freedom of action but subjection to ''rules''.  In [[ancient Rome|Rome]], the Greek concept was partly shaken, and [[visual art]]ists were viewed as sharing, with poets, [[imagination]] and [[artistic inspiration|inspiration]].

Under [[medieval]] [[Christianity]], the [[Latin]] "''creatio''" came to designate [[God]]'s act of "''[[creatio ex nihilo]]''" ("creation from nothing"); thus "''creatio''" ceased to apply to human activities.  The Middle Ages, however, went even further than antiquity, when they revoked poetry's exceptional status:  it, too, was an art and therefore craft and not creativity.

[[Renaissance]] men sought to give voice to their sense of their freedom and creativity.  The first to apply the word "creativity," however, was the 17th-century Polish poet [[Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski]] — but he applied it only to poetry.  For over a century and a half, the idea of ''human'' creativity met with resistance, because the term "creation" was reserved for creation "from nothing."

In the 19th century, art took its revenge:  now not only was art recognized as creativity, but ''it alone'' was.  When later, at the turn of the 20th century, there began to be discussion as well of creativity in the [[sciences]] and in [[nature]], this was taken as the transference, to the sciences and to nature, of concepts that were proper to art.

==Term and concept==
[[File:Head Platon Glyptothek Munich 548.jpg|thumb|85px|[[Plato]]]]
The [[ancient Greeks]] had no terms corresponding to "to create" or "creator."  The expression "''poiein''" ("to make") sufficed.  And even that was not extended to art in general, but only to ''poiesis'' (poetry) and to the ''poietes'' (poet, or "maker") who ''made'' it.  [[Plato]] asks in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', "Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?" and answers, "Certainly not, he merely [[mimesis|imitates]]."  To the ancient Greeks, the concept of a creator and of creativity implied freedom of action, whereas the Greeks' concept of art involved subjection to laws and rules.  Art (in Greek, "''techne''") was "the making of things, according to rules."  It contained no creativity, and it would have been — in the Greeks' view — a bad state of affairs if it ''had''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''A History of Six Ideas:  an Essay in Aesthetics'', p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

This understanding of art had a distinct premise:  [[Nature]] is [[perfection|perfect]] and is subject to laws, therefore man ought to discover its laws and submit to them, and not seek freedom, which will deflect him from that ''optimum'' which he can attain.  The artist was a [[discovery (observation)|discoverer]], not an [[inventor]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 245"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sole exception to this Greek view — a ''great'' exception — was poetry.  The poet made new things — brought to life a new world — while the artist merely ''imitated''.  And the poet, unlike the artist, was ''not'' bound by laws.  There were no terms corresponding to "creativity" or "creator," but in reality the poet was understood to be one who creates.  And only he was so understood.  In music, there was no freedom:  melodies were prescribed, particularly for ceremonies and entertainments, and were known tellingly as "''nomoi''" ("laws").  In the [[visual arts]], freedom was limited by the [[Body proportions|proportions]] that [[Polyclitus (sculptor)|Polyclitus]] had established for the human frame, and which he called "the canon" (meaning, "measure").  [[Plato]] argued in ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' that, to execute a good work, one must contemplate an eternal model.  Later the [[Roman Republic|Roman]], [[Cicero]], would write that art embraces those things "of which we have knowledge" ("''quae sciuntur''").&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 245"/&gt;

Poets saw things differently.  Book I of the ''[[Odyssey]]'' asks, "Why forbid the singer to please us with singing ''as he himself will?''"  [[Aristotle]] had doubts as to whether poetry was imitation of reality, and as to whether it required adherence to truth:  it was, rather, the realm of that "which is neither true nor false."&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, pp. 245–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rome, these Greek concepts were partly shaken.  [[Horace]] wrote that not only poets but painters as well were entitled to the privilege of daring whatever they wished to ("''quod libet audendi''").  In the declining period of antiquity, [[Philostratus]] wrote that "one can discover a similarity between poetry and art and find that they have [[imagination]] in common."  [[Callistratos]] averred that "Not only is the art of the poets and [[prose|prosaist]]s inspired, but likewise the hands of [[sculptor]]s are gifted with the blessing of divine [[Artistic inspiration|inspiration]]."  This was something new:  [[classical Greece|classical Greeks]] had not applied the [[concept]]s of [[imagination]] and inspiration to the [[visual arts]] but had restricted them to poetry.  [[Latin]] was richer than Greek:  it had a term for "creating" ("''creatio''") and for "''creator''," and had ''two'' expressions — "''facere''" and "''creare''" — where Greek had but one, "''poiein''."  Still, the two Latin terms meant much the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fundamental change, however, came in the Christian period:  "''creatio''" came to designate [[God]]'s act of "creation from nothing" ("''creatio ex nihilo''").  "''Creatio''" thus took on a different meaning than "''facere''" ("to make"), and ceased to apply to human functions.  As the 6th-century Roman official and literary figure [[Cassiodorus]] wrote, "things made and created differ, for we can make, who cannot create."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 247"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside this new, [[religion|religious]] interpretation of the expression, there persisted the ancient view that art is not a domain of creativity. This is seen in two early and influential Christian writers, [[Pseudo-Dionysius]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]. Later [[medieval]] men such as [[Hraban the Moor]], and [[Robert Grosseteste]] in the 13th century, thought much the same way.  The [[Middle Ages]] here went even further than [[classical antiquity|antiquity]]; they made no exception of poetry:  it too had its rules, was an art, and was therefore [[craft]] and not creativity.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 247"/&gt;

All this changed in modern times.  [[Renaissance]] men had a sense of their own independence, freedom and creativity, and sought to give voice to this sense of independence and creativity.  The philosopher [[Marsilio Ficino]] wrote that the artist "thinks up" ("''excogitatio''") his works; the theoretician of architecture and painting, [[Leon Battista Alberti]], that he "preordains" ("''preordinazione''"); [[Raphael]], that he shapes a painting according to his idea; [[Leonardo da Vinci]], that he employs "shapes that do not exist in nature"; [[Michelangelo]], that the artist realizes his vision rather than imitating nature; [[Giorgio Vasari]], that "nature is conquered by art"; the Venetian art theoretician, [[Paolo Pino]], that painting is "inventing what is not"; [[Paolo Veronese]], that painters avail themselves of the same liberties as do poets and madmen; [[Federico Zuccari]] (1542–1609), that the artist shapes "a new world, new paradises"; [[Cesare Cesariano]] (1483–1541), that architects are "demi-gods."  Among musicians, the [[Flanders|Flemish]] composer and musicologist [[Johannes Tinctoris]] (1446–1511) demanded novelty in what a composer did, and defined a composer as "one who produces ''new'' songs."&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, pp. 247–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still more emphatic were those who wrote about poetry:  [[G.P. Capriano]] held (1555) that the poet's invention springs "from nothing."  [[Francesco Patrizi]] (1586) saw poetry as "fiction," "shaping," "transformation."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 248"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, at long last, someone ventured to use the word, "creation."  He was the 17th-century Polish poet and theoretician of poetry, [[Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski]] (1595–1640), known as "the last Latin poet."  In his treatise, ''De perfecta poesi'', he not only wrote that a poet "invents," "after a fashion builds," but also that the poet "''creates anew''" ("''de novo creat''").  Sarbiewski even added:  "in the manner of God" ("''instar Dei''").&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 248"/&gt;

Sarbiewski, however, regarded creativity as the exclusive privilege of poetry; creativity was not open to visual artists.  "Other arts merely imitate and copy but do not create, because they assume the existence of the material from which they create or of the subject."  As late as the end of the 17th century, [[André Félibien]] (1619–75) would write that the painter is "so to speak [a] creator."  The Spanish [[Jesuit]] [[Baltasar Gracián]] (1601–58) wrote similarly as Sarbiewski:  "Art is the completion of nature, as it were ''a second Creator''..."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 248"/&gt;

By the 18th century, the concept of creativity was appearing more often in art theory.  It was linked with the concept of [[imagination]], which was on all lips. [[Joseph Addison]] wrote that the imagination "has something in it like creation."  [[Voltaire]] declared (1740) that "the true poet is creative."  With both these authors, however, this was rather only a ''comparison'' of poet with creator.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, pp. 248–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers took a different view.  [[Denis Diderot]] felt that imagination is merely "the memory of forms and contents," and "creates nothing" but only combines, magnifies or diminishes.  It was precisely in 18th-century France, indeed, that the idea of man's creativity met with resistance.  [[Charles Batteux]] wrote that "The human mind ''cannot create'', strictly speaking; all its products bear the stigmata of their model; even monsters invented by an imagination unhampered by laws can only be composed of parts taken from nature."  [[Luc de Clapiers, marquis de Vauvenargues]] (1715–47), and [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac]] (1715–80) spoke to a similar effect.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 249"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their resistance to the idea of human creativity had a triple source.  The expression, "creation," was then reserved for creation ''ex nihilo'' ({{lang-la|from nothing}}), which was inaccessible to man.  Second, creation is a mysterious act, and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] psychology did not admit of mysteries.  Third, artists of the age were attached to their rules, and creativity seemed irreconcilable with rules.  The latter objection was the weakest, as it was already beginning to be realized (e.g., by [[Houdar de la Motte]], 1715) that rules ultimately are a ''human invention''.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 249"/&gt;

In the 19th century, art took its compensation for the resistance of preceding centuries against recognizing it as creativity.  Now not only was art regarded as creativity, but ''it alone'' was so regarded. When later, at the turn of the 20th century, there began to be discussion as well of creativity in the [[science]]s (e.g., [[Jan Łukasiewicz]], 1878–1956) and in [[nature]] (e.g., [[Henri Bergson]]), this was generally taken as the transference, to the sciences and to nature, of concepts proper to art.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 249"/&gt;

The start of the ''scientific'' study of creativity is sometimes taken as [[J. P. Guilford]]'s 1950 address to the [[American Psychological Association]], which helped popularize the subject.&lt;ref name="metro"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cocreativity.com/handouts/guilford.pdf | title=Guilford's structure of the intellect | publisher=The Co-Creativity Institute | accessdate=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other students of creativity have taken a more pragmatic approach, teaching practical [[creativity techniques]]. Three of the best-known are [[Alex Osborn]]'s "[[brainstorming]]" (1950s to present), [[Genrikh Altshuller]]'s Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving ([[TRIZ]], 1950s to present), and [[Edward de Bono]]'s "[[lateral thinking]]" (1960s to present).

The '''International Year of Biodiversity''' ('''IYB''') was a year-long celebration of [[biodiversity|biological diversity]] and its importance, taking place internationally in 2010. Coinciding with the date of the [[2010 Biodiversity Target]], the year was declared by the 61st session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 2006.

It was meant to help raise awareness of the importance of biodiversity through activities and events, to influence decision makers, and "to elevate biological diversity nearer to the top of the political agenda".&lt;ref&gt;Johns, David (2009). The International Year of Biodiversity–From Talk to Action. ''Conservation Biology'' 24 (1): 338–340.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The United Nations General Assembly declared 2010 as the International Year of Biodiversity (Resolution 61/203). This year coincided with the 2010 Biodiversity Target adopted by the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity and by Heads of State and government at the World Summit for Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Marton-Lefèvre, Julia (2010). Biodiversity is our life. ''Science'' 313: 1179. [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/327/5970/1179 abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Secretariat of the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD), based in [[Montreal]], [[Canada]], was coordinating the International Year of Biodiversity campaign.

Established at the [[Earth Summit]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1992, the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] is an international treaty for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and the equitable sharing of the benefits of biodiversity. The CBD has near-universal participation, with 193 Parties.

==Main goals in UN view==
The main goals of the International Year of Biodiversity were to:
* Enhance public awareness of the importance of conserving biodiversity and of the underlying threats to biodiversity
* Raise awareness of the accomplishments to save biodiversity that had been realized by communities and governments
* Promote innovative solutions to reduce the threats to biodiversity
* Encourage individuals, organizations and governments to act immediately to halt [[biodiversity loss]]
* Start dialog between [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] for what to do in the post-2010 period

===Slogan===
::: '' Biodiversity is love. Biodiversity is life.''

{{sexual orientation}}
The '''Kinsey scale''', also called the '''Heterosexual–Homosexual Rating Scale''',&lt;ref name="kinsey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/research/ak-hhscale.html|title=Kinsey's Heterosexual–Homosexual Rating Scale|publisher=The [[Kinsey Institute]]|accessdate=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used in research to describe a person's [[sexual orientation]] based on their experience or response at a given time. The scale typically ranges from 0, meaning exclusively [[heterosexual]], to 6, meaning exclusively [[homosexual]]. In both the male and female volumes of the ''[[Kinsey Reports]]'', an additional grade, listed as "X", indicated "no socio-sexual contacts or reactions". The reports were first published in ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Male'' (1948) by [[Alfred Kinsey]], [[Wardell Pomeroy]], and others, and were also prominent in the complementary work ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Female'' (1953).&lt;ref name="kinsey" /&gt;
==History ==
Alfred Kinsey, the creator of the Kinsey scale, is known as "the father of the sexual revolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kinseyinstitute.org/about/history/index.php|title=Kinsey History|website=www.kinseyinstitute.org|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kinsey scale was created in order to demonstrate that sexuality does not fit into two strict categories: homosexual and heterosexual. Instead, Kinsey believed that sexuality is fluid and subject to change over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galupo|first=M. Paz|date=June 2014|title=Sexual Minority Reflections on the Kinsey Scale and the Klein Sexual Orientation Grid: Conceptualization and Measurement|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15299716.2014.929553?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true|journal=Journal of Bisexuality|volume=14|pages=|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of using sociocultural labels, Kinsey primarily used assessments of behavior in order to rate individuals on the scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galupo|first=M. Paz|date=June 2014|title=Sexual Minority Reflections on the Kinsey Scale and the Klein Sexual Orientation Grid: Conceptualization and Measurement|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15299716.2014.929553?af=R&amp;mobileUi=0|journal=Journal of Bisexuality|volume=14|pages=|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinsey's first rating scale had thirty categories that represented thirty different case studies, but his final scale has only seven categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sexarchive.info/GESUND/ARCHIV/SEXOR4.HTM|title=Archive for Sexology|website=www.sexarchive.info|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 8,000 interviews were coordinated throughout his research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bullough|first=Vern L.|date=January 2010|title=Alfred Kinsey and the Kinsey report: Historical overview and lasting contributions|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224499809551925|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|volume=35|pages=|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Introducing the scale, Kinsey wrote:
{{cquote|Males do not represent two discrete populations, heterosexual and homosexual. The world is not to be divided into sheep and goats. It is a fundamental of taxonomy that nature rarely deals with discrete categories... The living world is a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]] in each and every one of its aspects.

While emphasizing the continuity of the gradations between exclusively heterosexual and exclusively homosexual histories, it has seemed desirable to develop some sort of classification which could be based on the relative amounts of heterosexual and homosexual experience or response in each history [...] An individual may be assigned a position on this scale, for each period in his life. [...] A seven-point scale comes nearer to showing the many gradations that actually exist.|Kinsey, et al. (1948). pp. 639, 656}}

== Table of the scale ==

The Kinsey scale ranges from 0, for those who would identify themselves as exclusively heterosexual with no experience with or desire for sexual activity with their same sex, to 6, for those who would identify themselves as exclusively homosexual with no experience with or desire for sexual activity with those of the opposite sex, and 1-5 for those who would identify themselves with varying levels of desire for sexual activity with either sex, including "incidental" or "occasional" desire for sexual activity with the same sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/research/ak-hhscale.html |title=Kinsey Sexuality Rating Scale |publisher=The Kinsey Institute |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinsey recognized that the seven categories of the scale could not fully capture every individual's sexuality. He wrote that "it should be recognized that the reality includes individuals of every intermediate type, lying in a continuum between the two extremes and between each and every category on the scale."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JHWHCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP3#v=onepage|title=Sexual Behavior in the Human Female|last=Kinsey|first=Alfred C.|last2=Pomeroy|first2=Wardell B.|last3=Martin|first3=Clyde E.|last4=Gebhard|first4=Paul H.|date=1998-05-22|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253019240|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although sociologists [[Martin S. Weinberg]] and [[Colin J. Williams]] write that, in principle, people who rank anywhere from 1 to 5 could be considered [[bisexual]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Weinberg, Martin S. |author2=Williams, Colin J. |author3=Pryor, Douglas W. |title=Dual Attraction: Understanding Bisexuality |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |year=1995 |isbn=0-19-509841-2 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinsey disliked the use of the term ''bisexual'' to describe individuals who engage in sexual activity with both males and females, preferring to use ''bisexual'' in its original, biological sense as [[hermaphroditic]]; he stated, "Until it is demonstrated [that] taste in a sexual relation is dependent upon the individual containing within his anatomy both male and female structures, or male and female physiological capacities, it is unfortunate to call such individuals bisexual."&lt;ref name="Stange"/&gt; Psychologist Jim McKnight writes that while the idea that bisexuality is a form of sexual orientation intermediate between homosexuality and heterosexuality is implicit in the Kinsey scale, that conception has been "severely challenged" since the publication of ''[[Homosexualities: A Study of Diversity Among Men and Women|Homosexualities]]'' (1978), by Weinberg and the psychologist [[Alan P. Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;McKnight, Jim. ''Straight Science: Homosexuality, Evolution and Adaptation''. Routledge, 1997, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, although the additional X grade used to mean "no socio-sexual contacts or reactions" is today described as [[asexuality]],&lt;ref name="Stange"&gt;{{cite book|authors =Mary Zeiss Stange, Carol K. Oyster, Jane E. Sloan |title = Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World|isbn = 978-1-4129-7685-5|publisher=Sage Pubns|year=2011|page=158|accessdate=December 17, 2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bOkPjFQoBj8C&amp;pg=PA158}}&lt;/ref&gt; scholar Justin J. Lehmiller stated, "the Kinsey X classification emphasized a lack of sexual behavior, whereas the modern definition of asexuality emphasizes a lack of sexual attraction. As such, the Kinsey Scale may not be sufficient for accurate classification of asexuality."&lt;ref name="Lehmiller"&gt;{{cite book|author=Justin J. Lehmiller|title=The Psychology of Human Sexuality|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|isbn=1119164702|page=250|date=2017|accessdate=November 29, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ytk5DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Findings ==

=== Kinsey reports ===
{{Main|Kinsey Reports}}
The Kinsey Reports are two published works, "Sexual Behavior in the Human Female" and "Sexual Behavior in the Human male". These reports look into the sexual characteristics and development of the human males and females.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinsey 651" /&gt; Sexuality is examined in the Kinsey scale through the level of homosexuality in each person.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinsey 651" /&gt; The data to scale the participants comes from their "psychosexual responses and/or overt experience" in relation to sexual attraction and activity with the same and opposite sexes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The inclusion of psychosexual responses allows someone with less sexual experience to rank evenly with someone of greater sexual experience.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;!--Anyone who has access to the reports please complete the findings for prevalence of Kinsey 0, 1, 2, and 4. The statistics below were taken from http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/resources/ak-data.html --&gt;

* '''Men''': 11.6% of white males aged 20–35 were given a rating of 3 for this period of their lives.&lt;ref name="Kinsey 651"&gt;Kinsey, et al. 1948. ''[[Sexual Behavior in the Human Male]]'', Table 147, p. 651&lt;/ref&gt;  The study also reported that 10% of American males surveyed were "more or less exclusively homosexual for at least three years between the ages of 16 and 55" (in the 5 to 6 range).&lt;ref name="Kinsey 651" /&gt;
* '''Women''': 7% of single females aged 20–35 and 4% of previously married females aged 20–35 were given a rating of 3 for this period of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Kinsey, et al. 1953. ''[[Sexual Behavior in the Human Female]]'', Table 142, p. 499&lt;/ref&gt; 2% to 6% of females, aged 20–35, were given a rating of 5&lt;ref&gt;Kinsey, et al. 1953. ''[[Sexual Behavior in the Human Female]]'', p. 488&lt;/ref&gt; and 1% to 3% of unmarried females aged 20–35 were rated as 6.&lt;ref&gt;Kinsey, et al. 1953. ''[[Sexual Behavior in the Human Female]]'', Table 142, p. 499, and p. 474&lt;/ref&gt;

The results found in "Sexual Behavior in the Human Female" show a higher amount of men who lean towards homosexuality than recorded for the women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Kinsey addresses that the result is contrary to reports that women have more homosexual leanings than men. He poses that such reports are due to the "wishful thinking on the part of such heterosexual males."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Impact and later developments ==
===General===
{{Main|Scales of sexual orientation}}
The Kinsey scale is credited as one of the first attempts to "acknowledge the diversity and fluidity of human sexual behavior" by illustrating that "sexuality does not fall neatly into the [[Dichotomy|dichotomous]] categories of exclusively heterosexual or exclusively homosexual."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galupo|first=M. Paz|date=18 June 2014|title=Sexual Minority Reflections on the Kinsey Scale and the Klein Sexual Orientation Grid: Conceptualization and Measurement|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15299716.2014.929553?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true|journal=Journal of Bisexuality|volume=14|pages=404–432|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most studies regarding homosexuality, at the time, were conducted by medical professionals who were sought out by individuals that wanted to change their sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Randall L. Sell ScD &amp; Christian Petrulio BA (1996) Sampling Homosexuals, Bisexuals, Gays, and Lesbians for Public Health Research:, Journal of Homosexuality, 30:4, 31-47, DOI: 10.1300/J082v30n04_02&lt;/ref&gt; Alfred Kinsey's publications on human sexuality, which encompasses the Kinsey scale, were widely advertised and had a huge impact on society's modern conceptions of sexuality, post-[[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;“Page 167.” Sexual Revolution and the Politics of Gay Identity, by Jeffery Escoffier.&lt;/ref&gt; His work incorporates thousands of men and women who deviate widely on the Kinsey Scale.

Galupo et al. argued, "Despite the availability of the Kinsey Scale, assessment via [[Sociocultural perspective|sociocultural]] labels (i.e., heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual) is the predominant modality for determining the sexual orientation of research participants."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many sexologists see the Kinsey scale as relevant to sexual orientation, but not comprehensive enough to cover all [[sexual identity]] aspects. Measures of sexual orientation do not always correlate with individuals' self-identification labels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As such, sexual identity involves more than one component and may also involve [[biological sex]] and [[gender identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/sexual-orientation-gender-4329.htm |title=Sexual Orientation &amp; Gender |publisher=Planned Parenthood |date= |accessdate=2012-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bullough et al. argued that this "wide-scale public discussion of human sexuality" ultimately led Americans to challenge traditional [[heteronormative]] behaviors. His research and findings encouraged [[gay]] men and [[lesbian]]s to [[Coming out|come out]] by debunking a lot of stigma revolved around homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, V.L. Arch Sex Behav (2004) 33: 277. https://doi.org/10.1023/B:ASEB.0000026627.24993.03&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have further defined the scale. In 1980, Michael Storms proposed a two dimensional chart with an X and Y axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evaluation of Models of Sexual Orientation |url=http://www.uwlax.edu/pridecenter/images/101/Eval%20of%20Models%20of%20Sexual%20Orientation.pdf |publisher=University of Wisconsin–La Crosse |accessdate=September 6, 2012 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715130712/http://www.uwlax.edu/PrideCenter/images/101/Eval%20of%20Models%20of%20Sexual%20Orientation.pdf |archivedate=July 15, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This scale explicitly takes into account the case of asexuality and the simultaneous expression of hetero-eroticism and homo-eroticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siue.edu/~cbwilso/203misc4.jpg |title=Graph of Michael Storm Scale versus Kinsey Scale |publisher=Southern Illinois University Edwardsville |date= |accessdate=2012-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203001438/http://www.siue.edu/~cbwilso/203misc4.jpg |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fritz Klein, in his [[Klein Sexual Orientation Grid]], included factors such as how orientation can change throughout a person's lifetime, as well as emotional and social orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americaninstituteofbisexuality.org/thekleingrid/|title=The Klein Grid|website=AIB|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinsey, Storm, and Klein are only three of more than 200 scales to measure and describe sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Sexuality-Related Measures|year=2000|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-1-4129-1336-2|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Handbook_of_Sexuality_Related_Measures.html?id=EFPs55zfAKcC|author1=Clive M. Davis |author2=William L. Yarber |author3=Robert Bauserman |author4=George Schreer |author5=Sandra L. Davis }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there are scales that rate homosexual behaviors from 1 to 14, and measures for gender, masculinity, femininity, and transsexualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kinsey's Heterosexual-Homosexual Rating Scale|url=http://www.iub.edu/~kinsey/research/ak-hhscale.html|publisher=The Kinsey Institute|accessdate=September 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Sexuality-Related Measures|year=2000|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-1-4129-1336-2|page=137|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Handbook_of_Sexuality_Related_Measures.html?id=EFPs55zfAKcC|author1=Clive M. Davis |author2=William L. Yarber |author3=Robert Bauserman |author4=George Schreer |author5=Sandra L. Davis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surveys and other studies===
There have been similar studies using a scale from 0 to 10. In such studies, the person would be asked a question such as "If 0 is completely gay and 10 is completely hetero, what is your orientation number?".&lt;ref&gt;Sexuality Now: Embracing Diversity (2006) – Janbell L Caroll&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in 2014 aimed to explore "[[sexual minority]] individuals' qualitative responses regarding the ways in which the Kinsey Scale [...] captures (or fail to capture) their sexuality."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Participants completed the [Kinsey] scale and then were asked to respond to the following question: "In what ways did this scale capture or fail to capture your sexuality?"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; "A diverse sample of sexual minority participants, including individuals who (1) identify outside the traditional sexual orientation labels (i.e. [[Pansexuality|pansexual]], [[queer]], fluid, [[Asexuality|asexual]]) and (2) identify as [[transgender]], were recruited to complete an online questionnaire."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Participants represented a convenience sample of 285 individuals who self-identified as [[non-heterosexual]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; "Approximately one third of participants self-identified primarily as [[Monosexuality|monosexual]] (31.5%), whereas 65.8% identified as nonmonosexual, and 2.8% identified as asexual. Monosexual participants represented those who self-identified as lesbian (18.5%) or gay (12.2%) or homosexual (0.8%). Nonmonosexual participants included bisexual (24.1%), pansexual (16.8%), queer (19.6%), and fluid (1.4%) participants. A small minority of participants identified as 'other' (3.8%)."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Participants represented all regions of the continental United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For this study, the use of "X" was intended to describe asexuality or individuals who identify as nonsexual.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For a 2015 [[YouGov]] UK survey, when asked to place themselves on the Kinsey scale, 72% of all adults, and 46% of adults aged 18–24 years, picked a score of zero, totally heterosexual. On the other side, 4% of the total sample, and 6% of young adults, picked a score of six, meaning a totally homosexual identity.  Overall, 89% of the population described themselves as heterosexual.&lt;ref&gt;Will Dahlgreen. YouGov UK 2015 [https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/08/16/half-young-not-heterosexual/ 1 in 2 young people say they are not 100% heterosexual]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study published in 2017, questioned how people who do not identify as heterosexual felt about their representation on the Kinsey Scale.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galupo|first=M. Paz|last2=Mitchell|first2=Renae C.|last3=Davis|first3=Kyle S.|date=2018-05-01|title=Face Validity Ratings of Sexual Orientation Scales by Sexual Minority Adults: Effects of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-017-1037-y|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|language=en|volume=47|issue=4|pages=1241–1250|doi=10.1007/s10508-017-1037-y|issn=0004-0002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study takes a group of minority individuals who sexually identify as something other than heterosexual, and has them rate the Kinsey scale according to how well they feel represented by their value.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Each group gave it a rating between 1 and 5. In the results, the group that rated the scale the highest was the group that identified as lesbian or gay with a rating of 4.66.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The bisexual group rated it lower at 3.78, and the pansexual/queer group gave it the lowest rating at 2.68.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Another trend present in the results of the study, was that in regards to gender identity the [[cisgender]] group gave the scale a higher rating than the transgender group.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The cisgender rating was 4.09 and the transgender was 2.78.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4040">'''''Many Voices One World''''', also known as the '''MacBride report''', was a 1980 [[UNESCO]] publication written by the '''International Commission for the Study of Communication Problems''', chaired by [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] [[Nobel laureate]] [[Seán MacBride]]. Its aim was to analyze communication problems in modern societies, particularly relating to mass media and news, consider the emergence of new technologies, and to suggest a kind of communication order ([[New World Information and Communication Order]]) to diminish these problems to further peace and human development. 

Among the problems the report identified were concentration of the media, commercialization of the media, and unequal access to information and communication. The commission called for democratization of communication and strengthening of national media to avoid dependence on external sources, among others. Subsequently, Internet-based technologies considered in the work of the Commission, served as a means for furthering MacBride's visions.

While the report had strong international support, it was condemned by the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] as an attack on the freedom of the press, and both countries withdrew from UNESCO in protest in 1984 and 1985, respectively (and later rejoined in 2003 and 1997, respectively).

==The MacBride Commission==
The '''International Commission for the Study of Communication Problems''' was set up in 1977 by the director of UNESCO [[Ahmadou-Mahtar M’Bow]], under suggestion by the USA delegation. It was agreed that the commission would be chaired by Seán MacBride from Ireland and representatives from 15 other countries, invited  due to their roles in national and international communication activities and picked among media activists, journalists, scholars, and media executives.

The members of the MacBride Commission were:
* [[Elie Abel]] (USA)
* [[Hubert Beuve-Méry]] (France)
* [[Elebe Ma Ekonzo]] (Zaire)
* [[Gabriel García Márquez]] (Colombia)
* [[Sergei Losev (scientist)|Sergei Losev]] (Soviet Union)
* [[Mochtar Lubis]] (Indonesia)
* [[Mustapha Masmoudi]] (Tunisia)
* [[Michio Nagai]] (Japan)
* [[Fred Isaac Akporuaro Omu]] (Nigeria)
* [[Bogdan Osolnik]] (Yugoslavia)
* [[Gamal El Oteifi]] (Egypt)
* [[Jan Pronk|Johannes Pieter Pronk]] (Netherlands)
* [[Juan Somavía]] (Chile)
* [[Boobli George Verghese]] (India)
* [[Betty Zimmerman]] (Canada), in substitution of [[Marshal McLuhan]], then ill

The commission presented a preliminary report in October 1978 at the 20th General Conference of UNESCO in [[Paris]].  The Commission's seminal session on new technologies to address the identified problems, was hosted by India at [[New Delhi in March 1979]]. The final report was delivered to M’Bow in April 1980 and was approved by consensus in the 21st General Conference of UNESCO in [[Belgrade]]. The commission dissolved after presenting the report.

Because of controversy surrounding the report and the withdrawal of support by the UNESCO leadership in the 1980s for its ideas, the book went out of print and was difficult to obtain. A book on the history of the United States and UNESCO was even threatened with legal action and forced to include a disclaimer that UNESCO was in no way involved with it. The MacBride report was eventually reprinted by Rowman and Littlefield in the US, and is also freely available online.

The term "MEI", like "TEI", describes the governing organization and the markup language. The MEI community solicits input and development directions from specialists in various music research communities, including technologists, librarians, historians, and theorists in a common effort to discuss and define best practices for representing a broad range of musical documents and structures. The results of these discussions are then formalized into the MEI schema, a core set of rules for recording physical and intellectual characteristics of music notation documents. This schema is expressed in an [[XML Schema]] Language, with [[RelaxNG]] being the preferred format.  The MEI schema is developed using the One-Document-Does-it-all (ODD) format, a [[literate programming]] XML format developed by the Text Encoding Initiative.

A '''music community''' is a group of people involved in a given type of music. Typically such a community has an informal, supportive structure.
In the past such groups have typically developed within a town or school, where the members can meet physically. The internet has made it possible for a more dispersed music community to use the web for communication, either via specialized websites or through broader social media. Ethnographic studies indicate that online music communities do not center around one website, but use a network of sites, including personal blogs, artist or publisher sites and social media.

==General==

The musician and musicologist [[Mícheál Ó Súilleabháin]] has broadly defined a music community as "a group of interested participants who agree on the form and content of the music and its social contexts".{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=122}}
A music community may be taken to mean a group of people with strong ties who often come together to play and talk about music, but a sense of community may also come from a national educational system that connects young people to their cultural heritage and traditions.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=122–123}}
A more restrictive view limits the term "music community" to teachers, composers, performers and the music distribution industry.{{sfn|National Commission on Music Education|1991|p=xi}}

The concept of music communities is well-developed in [[ethnomusicology]]. A large part of this discipline consists of studies of groups of people who frequently exchange and communicate musical material.{{sfn|Nettl|2005|p=52}}

Barry Shank, writing in 1994 of [[Rock and roll]] in [[Austin, Texas]], used the word "subculture" to define the shifting meanings and membership of musical communities, or cultural spaces. 
Will Straw built on this work, replacing the term "subculture" by "scene".{{sfn|Wolf|2007|p=19}}
Straw saw a "scene" as relatively transient, while a music community is more stable. He wrote in 1991 that a music community engages in "an ongoing exploration of one or more musical idioms said to be rooted within a geographically specific historical heritage."{{sfn|Laughey|2006|p=100}}
Disputing Straw's characterization, later writers have pointed  out that music communities may be mobile and transient.{{sfn|Denzin|2010|p=75}}

Musical communities typically have very flexible structures, voluntary membership and people of a wide range of ages.{{sfn|Colwell|Richardson|2002|p=731}}
They offer participants the opportunity to play different roles including creator, participant or observer. Conscious efforts may be made to involve disadvantaged members. 
Typically the group encourages diversity, and all members are committed to lifetime learning.{{sfn|Colwell|Richardson|2002|p=731}}
When a music community is widespread, aspects of music-making such as repertoire and style may evolve and diverge.{{sfn|Brinner|1995|p=75}}

==Types of music community==

There are many types of music community.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}
Women's music communities among the Ewe people of Ghana help create bonds and nurture cooperation between women who would otherwise be pulled apart by competition in their polygamist society.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=23}}
Irish immigrants to the United States were generally keen to assimilate and adopt a new ethnic identity as Americans, but a minority held onto their traditional culture and formed [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish traditional music]] communities in [[Boston]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Chicago]] and other cities.{{sfn|Nicholsen|2007|p=3}}
After over one hundred years these communities persisted. The primary reason seems to have simply been the entertainment value.{{sfn|Nicholsen|2007|p=268}}
Teachers may deliberately foster development of a music community within their school, which can assist students in reaching their full potential.{{sfn|Froehlich|2004|p=4}}
Such teachers may build on the [[Suzuki method]] in the belief that cooperation in group classes plays an important role, and that competition is inappropriate.{{sfn|Froehlich|2004|p=6}}
According to Mary Ann Froehlich, "Competition isolates, while cooperation creates community. ... Our goal is to build an inclusive music community."{{sfn|Froehlich|2004|p=7}}

==Online music communities==

One of the early online music communities was established in 1996 by [[Oh Boy Records]], a small independent record company. It took the form of a chat page on its website that let fans of [[John Prine]] exchange views and information. The website became the base of a specialized Prine music community.{{sfn|Kibby|2006|p=295}}
However, as Prine ceased performing while fighting cancer, and no new recordings were released, the community ran out of information to exchange and went into decline.{{sfn|Kibby|2006|p=299}}
Oh Boy eventually closed the chat page.{{sfn|Kibby|2006|p=301}}
Another early online music community that was the subject of an ethnographic study was the Banjo Hangout, established in 2000.
As of 2011 it had about 51,000 members and featured a large online learning center.{{sfn|Waldron|2011|p=32}}
[[imeem]], a social networking site with 28 million monthly visitors, was the first music community to provide ad-supported free online music streaming and downloading. 
Other sites such as [[Myspace]] followed with similar services.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=116}}
Specialized software has been developed to support online music communities.{{sfn|Creative Commons Music Communities}}

[[Online communities]] have emerged for genres of folk music such as [[Bluegrass music|Blue Grass]] and [[Old-time music|Old Time]]. [[Cyber-ethnography]] using the framework of [[Étienne Wenger]]'s [[social learning theory]] shows that sites like this may be considered a [[community of practice]] (CoP).{{sfn|Waldron|2009|p=97}}
The members of an online music community can publish, listen to and evaluate the music they have created, giving them a strong sense of membership. It provides a platform within which members can create a musical identity as well as one in which they can build social bonds.{{sfn|Veblen|Elliott|Messenger|Silverman|2013|p=51}}
J. P. Williams, writing in 2006 in the ''[[Journal of Contemporary Ethnography]]'', argued that the driving force behind online music communities is the interest of the participants in building their identities, despite the ostensible focus on making and sharing music.{{sfn|Rikandi|2010|p=199, 205}}

A 2013 book notes that in Finland the ''Mikseri'' music portal, with about 140,000 registered users, helps people create, share and discuss their music in this sparsely-populated country.
This web-based community was the object of ethnographic studies in 2008 and 2009 based on theories of sociocultural learning.{{sfn|Veblen|Elliott|Messenger|Silverman|2013|p=50}}
Members of Mikseri do not exclusively belong to that community, but may belong to other real-world or online communities.{{sfn|Veblen|Elliott|Messenger|Silverman|2013|p=51}}
An analysis of event-related data from an online music community shows that events on that site often cause increased interest in a given artist, but propagation over links within digital social communities is also an important factor.{{sfn|Tirado|Higuero|Isaila|Carretero|2011}}
An investigation of the music community of fans of Swedish [[indie music]] showed that they do not gather around one site, but interact with a network of sites including their own fan sites, Myspace, [[Last.fm]], [[YouTube]] and so on.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=143}}

Online discussion forums may provide some of the functions of virtual music communities.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=123}}
However, according to Mary McCarthy a music community should teach uninitiated listeners or musicians, and an online group cannot fill this role.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=123}}
Only a community of real people in a real place can provide the depth of contact, discussion, sharing and support that the novice musician requires for their development.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=124}}

==Community Music Therapy==

Music Therapy is the use of musical instruments, the audio of already made music or the task of improvisational music to either relieve a symptom that involves speech or memory, but one of the newest uses of music therapy using Community music has been in prisons this has helped rehabilitate prisoners mentally of their criminal struggles as well as their mental struggles with anxiety and depression as studied by Dr Christian Gold.

The '''New Bach Edition''' (NBE), in [[German language|German]] '''Neue Bach-Ausgabe''' (NBA), is the second complete edition of the music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], published by [[Bärenreiter]]. The name is short for Johann Sebastian Bach: New Edition of the Complete Works (Johann Sebastian Bach: Neue Ausgabe sämtlicher Werke). It is a historical-critical edition (German: ''historisch-kritische Ausgabe'') of Bach's complete works by the [[Johann Sebastian Bach Institute]] (Johann-Sebastian-Bach-Institut) in Göttingen and the [[Bach Archive]] (Bach-Archiv) in Leipzig,

When Bach died most of his work was unpublished. The first complete edition of Bach's music was published in the second half of the nineteenth century by the [[Bach Gesellschaft]] ([[Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe]], BGA). The second complete edition includes some discoveries made since 1900, but there are relatively few such scores.  The significance of the NBE lies more in its incorporation of the latest scholarship.&lt;ref name="musiclibrary"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-53519953.html | title=Joahann Sebastian Bach: Ratswahlkantaten, II.(Review) | publisher=[[Music Library Association]]  via [[HighBeam Research]] (subscription required) | work=[[Notes (journal)|Notes]] | date=1998 | accessdate=September 26, 2012 | author=Melamed, Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the NBE is an [[urtext edition]] rather than a facsimile edition, it includes many facsimiles of Bach manuscripts. 

==History==

In 1950, the commemorations of the bicentennial of Bach's death in [[Göttingen]] and [[Leipzig]] led to the initiative to publish his complete works in a critical scientific edition. Musicologists such as [[Friedrich Blume]], Max Schneider, {{Interlanguage link multi|Friedrich Smend|de}} and [[Heinrich Besseler]], and sponsors such as [[Bernhard Sprengel]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Otto Benecke|de}} made the project possible, supported by the editor {{Interlanguage link multi|Karl Vötterle|de}}.

The [[Neue Bachgesellschaft]] recommended to pursue the project as a joint venture of musicologists in Göttingen, then [[West Germany]], and Leipzig, then [[East Germany]], in order to stress that the common cultural heritage was indivisible. The Bach Archive and the Johann Sebastian Bach Institute collaborated, their directors [[Werner Neumann]] and [[Alfred Dürr]] made the new edition their life's project.  The publishers were [[Bärenreiter]] in [[Kassel]], chosen in 1951 by the Federal Government, and from 1954 the Deutscher Verlag für Musik, a new publisher in Leipzig which was involved until the unification of Germany.

Initially the duration of the edition was estimated as 15 to 20 years, but the scientific work with the sources required much more time than anticipated. The first volumes appeared in 1954. The edition was completed in June 2007.&lt;ref name="NBA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Welt"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.welt.de/politik/article939434/Praeludium_zur_Deutschen_Einheit.html |title=Präludium zur Deutschen Einheit |author=Volker Tarnow |date=12 June 2007 |language=German |accessdate=9 January 2011 |publisher=[[Die Welt]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libraries.uc.edu/libraries/ccm/incs/neuebachausgabe.html |title=Neue Bach-Ausgabe |accessdate=9 January 2011 |publisher=[[University of Cincinnati]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==

The edition contains in eight series over 100 volumes of scores (Notenbände), each Score (Partitur) volume complemented with a Critical Commentary (Kritischer Bericht) volume. The ninth series contains Addenda (7 volumes), and furthermore there is a  Supplement of 9 volumes (Supplementbände):&lt;ref name="NBA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baerenreiter.com/html/completeedi/Bach/bach-ga.htm |title=Johann Sebastian Bach / 1685-1750 / New Edition of the Complete Works |accessdate=7 January 2011 |publisher=[[Bärenreiter]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103204656/http://baerenreiter.com/html/completeedi/Bach/bach-ga.htm |archivedate=3 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:IX. Addenda (approximately 7 volumes)
:Supplement: Bach Documents (9 volumes)

Each Score volume contains a preface and a selection of [[facsimile]]s of its sources. In the Score volumes variants and fragments of compositions are published along with complete works. The Critical Commentary volumes describe the history and sources (manuscript sources, early editions), and their interdependence, for each composition, and discuss editorial issues.&lt;ref name="NBA" /&gt;

== Relevance ==

The New Bach Edition presents a reliable version of Bach's music for both scientists and performers. Its strict philological methods were exemplary for critical scientific editions in the second half of the 20th century. 

In preparation for the NBE, lost compositions were found, whereas some known compositions proved to be not Bach's works. The examination of the sources corrected the chronology of his compositions.&lt;ref name="NBA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Welt" /&gt;

The second revised edition of the [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis]], and the Bach-Digital website refer to the NBE volume and page number for every listed composition by Bach. In addition to listing the page number of the score, the Bach Digital website also mentions the page number where the composition is discussed in the corresponding Critical Commentary volume.&lt;ref&gt;(BWV&lt;sup&gt;2a&lt;/sup&gt;) [[Alfred Dürr]], Yoshitake Kobayashi (eds.), Kirsten Beißwenger.

In February 2010 the Bach Archive and the publisher announced a revision of single volumes, in order to include new sources and findings. The first in this series of revisions was the [[Mass in B minor]] (updating the second volume of the NBE).
Approximately 15 more volumes are planned, including [[Bach cantata#Weimar|Weimar cantatas]] (five works), the ''[[St John Passion]]'', the motets, the [[Sonatas and partitas for solo violin (Bach)|violin sonatas]], the [[Cello Suites (Bach)|cello suites]] and others.&lt;ref name="Revised"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.baerenreiter.com/en/spotlight-on/gesamt-und-werkausgaben/bach-johann-sebastian/nbarev/ | title=New Bach Edition – Revised (NBArev) | publisher=Baerenreiter | accessdate=September 28, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AYaBsn3W?url=https://www.baerenreiter.com/en/spotlight-on/gesamt-und-werkausgaben/bach-johann-sebastian/nbarev/ | archivedate=September 9, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Noise regulation''' includes [[statute]]s or guidelines relating to sound transmission established by national, state or provincial and [[municipal]] levels of government. After the watershed passage of the United States [[Noise Control Act|Noise Control Act of 1972]],&lt;ref name="92-574"&gt;U.S. Noise Pollution and Abatement Act of 1972, P.L. 92-574, 86 Stat. 1234, {{Usc|42|4901}} - {{Usc|42|4918}}&lt;/ref&gt; other local and state governments passed further regulations.

A noise regulation{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} restricts the amount of noise, the duration of noise and the source of noise. It usually places restrictions for certain times of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.kineticsnoise.com/industrial/noise_ordinance.html|title= Noise Ordinance
|publisher= Kinetics Noise Control, Inc|accessdate=2012-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Japan]] enacted national laws in 1960 and 1967 respectively, these laws were not at all comprehensive or fully enforceable as to address generally rising ambient noise, enforceable numerical source limits on aircraft and motor vehicles or comprehensive directives to local government.

==History==
[[File:NIOSH Occupational Noise Exposure Criteria Document.jpg|alt=NIOSH Criteria for A Recommended Standard - Occupational Noise Exposure|thumb|388x388px|NIOSH Criteria for A Recommended Standard - [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/98-126/pdfs/98-126.pdf Occupational Noise Exposure]]]

===United States initial legislation===
In the 1960s and earlier, few people recognized that citizens might be entitled to be protected from adverse sound level exposure.  Most concerted actions consisted of citizens groups organized to oppose a specific highway or airport, and occasionally a [[nuisance]] [[lawsuit]] would arise. Things in the United States changed rapidly with passage of the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA) in 1969 and the Noise Pollution and Abatement Act, more commonly called the Noise Control Act (NCA), in 1972. Passage of the NCA was remarkable considering the lack of historic organized citizen concern. However, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) had testified before [[United States Congress|Congress]] that 30 million Americans are exposed to non-[[occupational]] noise high enough to cause [[hearing loss]] and 44 million Americans live in homes impacted by aircraft or highway noise.&lt;ref&gt;Noise Control Act, Public Law 92-574, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amendment, Public Law 94-301,1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amendment, Public law 95-609, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amendment, Public Law 100-418, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

NEPA requires all federally funded major actions to be analyzed for all physical environmental impacts including [[noise pollution]], and the NCA directed the EPA to promulgate regulations for a host of noise emissions. Many city [[local ordinance|ordinances]] prohibit sound above a threshold intensity from trespassing over property line at night, typically between 9 p.m. to 7 a.m., and during the day restricts it to a higher sound level; however, enforcement is uneven. Many municipalities do not follow up on complaints. Even where a municipality has an enforcement office, it may only be willing to issue warnings, since taking offenders to court is expensive. A notable exception to this rule is the City of [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland, Oregon]], which has instituted an aggressive protection for its citizens with fines reaching as high at $5000 per infraction, with the ability to cite a responsible noise violator multiple times in a single day.&lt;ref&gt;"City of Portland Code and Charter." Title 18, Chapter 18.18 [http://www.portlandonline.com/auditor/index.cfm?c=28714#cid_18511 "Title 18 Noise Control"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Occupational Safety and Health Act (United States)|Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970]], employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]]'s role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance. The same Act charges the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) with recommending occupational safety and health standards. NIOSH communicates these recommended standards to regulatory agencies (including OSHA) and to others in the occupational safety and health community through the publication and dissemination of Criteria Documents such as the Criteria for A Recommended Standard - Occupational Noise Exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/98-126/default.html|title=Occupational Noise Exposure|last=NIOSH|first=|date=1998|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Jul 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Follow-up on initial U.S. laws===
Initially these laws had a significant effect on thoughtful study of transportation programs and also federally funded [[House|housing]] programs in the United States.  They also gave [[U.S. state|states]] and cities an impetus to consider environmental noise in their [[land use planning|planning]] and [[zoning]] decisions, and led to a host of statutes below the federal level.  Awareness of the need for noise control was rising. In fact, by 1973 a national poll of 60,000 U.S. residents found that sixty percent of people considered street noise to have a "disturbing, harmful or dangerous" impact.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development survey. As reported by Kenneth Eldred at the Fifth International Congress on Noise as an International Problem, Sweden, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

This trend continued strongly throughout the 1970s in the U.S., with about half of the states and hundreds of cities passing substantive noise control laws. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] coordinated all federal noise control activities through its Office of Noise Abatement and Control. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] phased out the office's funding in 1982 as part of a shift in federal noise control policy to transfer the primary responsibility of regulating noise to state and local governments. However, the Noise Control Act of 1972 and the Quiet Communities Act of 1978 were never rescinded by Congress and remain in effect today, although essentially unfunded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/history/epa-history-noise-and-noise-control-act|title=EPA History: Noise and the Noise Control Act|last=EPA|first=|date=1982|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Jul 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) regulates [[aircraft noise]] by specifying the maximum noise level that individual civil aircraft can emit through requiring aircraft to meet certain noise certification standards. These standards designate changes in maximum noise level requirements by "stage" designation. The U.S. noise standards are defined in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 14 Part 36 – Noise Standards: Aircraft Type and Airworthiness Certification (14 CFR Part 36). The [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] also pursues a program of aircraft noise control in cooperation with the aviation community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/noise_emissions/airport_aircraft_noise_issues/|title=Aircraft Noise Issues|last=FAA|first=|date=Jan 9, 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Jul 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA) developed noise regulations to control [[Roadway noise|highway noise]] as required by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1970. The regulations requires promulgation of traffic noise-level criteria for various land use activities, and describe procedures for the abatement of highway traffic noise and construction noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/noise/|title=Highway Traffic Noise|last=FHWA|first=|date=June 5, 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Jul 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, some states continued to act. California carried out an ambitious plan to require its cities to establish a "Noise Element of the General Plan," which provides guidance for land planning decisions to minimize noise impacts on the public.  Many cities throughout the U.S. also have noise ordinances, which specifies the allowable sound level that can cross property lines. These ordinances can be enforced with local [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]]s.&lt;ref name="Local ords"&gt;Noise Pollution Clearinghouse, Montpelier, VT. [http://www.nonoise.org/lawlib/cities/cities.htm "Noise Regulations &amp; Ordinances of U.S. Cities, Counties and Towns."] Accessed 2010-08-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
[[Japan]] actually passed the first national noise control act, but its scope was much more limited than the U.S. law, addressing mainly workplace and construction noise.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Japan. Ministry of Environment. Law No. 98 of 1968. Latest amendment by Law No. 91 of 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe and Asia===
Several European countries emulated the U.S. national noise control law: Netherlands (1979), France (1985), Spain (1993), and Denmark (1994). In some cases unlegislated innovations have led to quieter products exceeding legal mandates (for example, hybrid vehicles or best available technology in washing machines). [[Environmental noise]] is a special definition in the [[Directive (European Union)|European directive]] 2002/49/EC article 10.1.

==Local noise ordinances in U.S. and Europe==
[[Local ordinance]]s are principally aimed at construction noise, power equipment operated by individuals and unmuffled [[industrial noise]] penetrating residential areas. Thousands of U.S. cities have prepared noise ordinances that give [[noise control]] officers and police the power to investigate noise complaints and enforcement power to abate the offending noise source, through shutdowns and fines.&lt;ref name="Local ords" /&gt; In the 1970s and early 1980s there was even a professional association for noise enforcement officers called NANCO, "National Association of Noise Control Officials."

Today only a handful of properly trained Noise Control Officers remain in the United States. A typical noise ordinance sets forth clear definitions of acoustic nomenclature and defines categories of noise generation; then numerical standards are established, so that enforcement personnel can take the necessary steps of warnings, fines or other municipal police power to rectify unacceptable noise generation.  Ordinances have achieved certain successes but they can be thorny to implement. Many European cities are still treating noise as the U.S. did in the 1960s, as a nuisance and not as a numerical standard to be achieved.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}
* Effects of Noise on Health and Welfare
&lt;ref&gt;Kryter, K.D., "The Effects of Noise on Man”, Academic Press, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berglund, B, Lindvall, T, Schwela, D. "Guidelines for Community Noise", World Health Organization, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Public Health and Welfare Criteria for Noise, Office of Noise Abatement and Control, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,  EPA 550/9-73-002, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Information on levels of Environmental Noise Requisite to Protect Public Health and Welfare with an Adequate Margin of Safety, US Environmental Agency, Office of Noise Abatement and Control, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

One obligation of a community is to protect its citizens from adverse environmental influences.  Noise is one of these factors, Noise has documented effects on people, they can be divided into three types.  The first type is a physical effect that directly and adversely effects a person's health. Hearing loss and vibration of bodily components are examples. The second type is a physiological effect that adversely effects a person's health; heightened blood pressure and general stress response are examples.  The third type is psychological that adversely effects a person's welfare; examples are distraction, annoyance, and complaint.
	The only feasible legal basis for a community’s right to control noise is based on these adverse health and welfare effects.  It is clearly easier to uphold the constitutionality of a noise ordinance in a court of law if it can be shown that it is based on health and welfare concerns.  The following is a short list of recognized effects of noise that can be addressed as a reason for a noise ordinance.
:Excess non-Occupational noise exposure, hearing loss on both public and private property, speech interference on both public and private property, audio interference on both public and private property, and sleep interference on mostly private property.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnet, M.H., Arand, D.L., Heart Rate Variability: Sleep Stage, Time of Night, and Arousal Influences" Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Wright State University, and Kettering Medical Center, Dayton, OH, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Some legal considerations in the United States===
There are several fundamental issues that shape the legality, effectiveness and enforceability of any community noise regulation.

====Preemption====
The federal government has preempted certain areas of noise regulation. They can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations under the EPA Noise Abatement Programs;&lt;ref&gt;Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40 - Protection of Environment, Chapter I - Environmental Protection Agency, Subchapter G - Noise Abatement Programs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/pagedetails.action?collectionCode=CFR&amp;searchPath=Title+40%2FChapter+I%2FSubchapter+G&amp;granuleId=CFR-2011-title40-vol25-chapI-subchapG&amp;packageId=CFR-2011-title40-vol25&lt;/ref&gt; Parts 201 to 205 and 211 cover railroads, motor carriers in interstate commerce, construction equipment, motor vehicles.  They require product labeling and prohibit tampering with noise control devices.  Communities may enact regulations that are no more strict than the federal ones so that local enforcement can be carried out.  They can enact curfews and restrict vehicle use in established zones such as residential.  Any restriction on interstate motor carriers or railroads may NOT be for the purpose of noise control.
States have police powers granted by the Constitution.  They may also enact regulations that are no more strict than federal regulations. They may also preempt local ordinances.  California &lt;ref&gt;California Health and Safety Code 46000-46080&lt;/ref&gt; and New Jersey&lt;ref&gt;NJAC 7:29&lt;/ref&gt; have comprehensive noise codes that communities must meet. Many states required that local ordinances be no more strict than the state code whether such code exists or not.  One relatively common preemption is protection of shooting ranges from noise regulation or litigation&lt;ref&gt;Arizona Revised Statutes, Chapter 17-602&lt;/ref&gt; and right to farm laws that protect agricultural areas from nuisance litigation by encroaching residential areas.&lt;ref&gt;Florida Right to Farm Act Article, pp.823-14{{Clarify pp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Constitutional vagueness====
In one case, the United States Supreme Court has said [[Void for vagueness]]
“It is a basic principle of due process (Amendment V) that an enactment is void for vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined. Vague laws offend several important values. First, because we assume that man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful conduct, we insist that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly. Vague laws may trap the innocent by not providing ''fair warning''.  Second, if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them.  A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of ''arbitrary and discriminatory application''.  Third, but related, where a vague statute abuts upon sensitive areas of basic First Amendment freedoms, it operates to inhibit the exercise of those freedoms. (the chilling effect).  In one case,&lt;ref&gt;State of New Jersey vs. Clarksburg Inn, 375 N.J. Super. 624, 868 A.2s 112, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; the court declared that numerical sound levels were constitutional as well as the term ''plainly audible'' provided it was associated with a reasonable distance. Two requirements for a noise ordinance provision is that:
#provide fair warning
#avoid the possibility of arbitrary enforcement

====Free Speech====
Examples are: slander, hate speech, and [[Shouting fire in a crowded theater|falsely calling "fire" in an assembly]]. Generally, the time, place, or manner of restrictions must:
#be content neutral
#be narrowly tailored
#serve a significant government interest
#leave open alternative channels of communication
One example&lt;ref&gt;Madsen vs. Women's Health Center&lt;/ref&gt; concerned protesters outside an abortion clinic.  The US Supreme Court stated that limitations placed on noise making were necessary to ensure the well-being of patients.

====Overbreadth====
The US Supreme Court has addressed the issue of too much regulation by defining overbreadth as: ''A clear, precise enactment may nevertheless be overbroad if, in its reach, it prohibits constitutionally protected conduct.'' One means to avoid being overbroad is by having provisions that are specific so that potential violators are given fair warning of what is prohibited. In one case &lt;ref&gt;Grayned vs. City of Rockford, 408 US 104 (19720&lt;/ref&gt; the court ruled that the specificity of the city ordinance (Section 17-35) regulating school verbal protests was not ''constitutionally vague'', gave ''fair warning'', and was not an invitation to arbitrary enforcement and so was not overbroad, despite the implied limitation on free speech.

====Nuisance====
Nuisances are part of tort law. Torts are civil wrongs whether intentional or accidental from which injury occurs to another. Nuisances can be public or private.  A public nuisance is an unreasonable interference with a right common to the general public while a private nuisance is an interference with a person's enjoyment and use of his land. [[Black's Law Dictionary]] defines a nuisance as''... that which annoys and disturbs one in possession of his property, rendering its ordinary use and occupation physically uncomfortable to him.''  It defines a private nuisance as:..''anything done to the hurt or annoyance of the lands, tenements, or hereditaments of another.  As distinguished from public nuisance, it includes any wrongful act which destroys or deteriorates the property of an individual or of a few persons or interferes with their lawful use or enjoyment thereof, or any act which unlawfully hinders them in the enjoyment of a common or public right and causes them a special injury different from that sustained by the general public.'' The word ''nuisance'' is connected closely with the word ''disturbance'' which is used extensively in many noise ordinances. A definition below further restricts the meaning to ''noise disturbance''.  Nuisance law applies to both community noise regulation as well as private suits brought to court to reduce noise impact.

====Enforceability====
Care must be taken in writing a ''subjective'' noise provision so that it overcomes the objections listed above. Care must be taken when writing an ''objective'' noise provision to make sure that the sound levels are physically realizable.  For example, requiring the maximum sound level of an automobile to be 40&amp;nbsp;dB(A) or the maximum sound level in a residential zone to be 30&amp;nbsp;dB(A) opens the provision to an enforceability challenge

====Confiscation====
Confiscation is the taking of private property for public use without compensation. It may occur legally when the government seizes property used in illegal practices.    Confiscation may occur without an arrest of a person because it is seen as an arrest of property, rather than a person, and the necessity of finding a party guilty is not required in all cases. In many cases, the guilt or innocence of the property owner is irrelevant and the government need not prove anything ''beyond a reasonable doubt''. In order to seize property, there must be either a warrant or a showing of probable cause. The mere showing of probable cause to support the forfeiture of an individual’s property has been a controversial issue. Court opinion varies, but probable cause most often means that the government need only demonstrate reasonable grounds for the belief that the property is properly subject to forfeiture, which can be supported by something less than prima facie proof, but more than mere suspicion. The Peoria, Illinois noise ordinance (Sections 15-75 and 15-77) allows confiscation of vehicles that emit excessive sound caused by sound producing devices. Colorado Springs, Colorado (Section 9.8.102) permits confiscation of sound producing devices.

===Four Types of Noise Regulation===
&lt;ref name="noisefree.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noisefree.org/Noise-Ordinance-Manual.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911031249/http://www.noisefree.org/Noise-Ordinance-Manual.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fixed sound sources must be treated differently than moving sources.  In the former case, the listener is normally defined while for moving sources it is not.  Historically, regulations were enforced by the subjective judgment of an enforcing officer.  With the advent of sound measuring equipment, the judgment can be based on measured sound levels. Most comprehensive noise ordinances contain four types of provisions.

'''Subjective Emission'''
These regulations allow an official to ''decide'' if the output of a sound source is acceptable ''without'' recourse to sound measurements and without regard to the presence of a specific listener. Regulations with ''plainly audible'' terms on public property as a criterion are examples.

'''Subjective Immission'''
These regulations allow an official to ''decide'' if the sound received by a listener is acceptable ''without'' recourse to sound measurements and without regard for the specific sound power generated by the source.. Regulations with ''plainly audible'' or ''noise disturbance'' terms on private property as a criterion are examples.

'''Objective Emission'''
These regulations require an official to ''measure'' the output of a sound source to determine whether it is acceptable ''without'' regard to the presence of a specific listener. Regulations with specific maximum sound output levels for motor vehicles are examples.

'''Objective Immission'''
These regulations require an official to ''measure'' the sound received by a listener to determine whether it is acceptable ''without'' regard to the specific sound power generated by the source.  Regulations with maximum allowable sound levels on property lines are examples

===Some Definitions used in the United States===
many communities have definitions that are local to them, such as those defining motor vehicles and sound levels and sound level  measurements.  Some that have been added to make noise enforcement more specific are listed here.&lt;ref name="noisefree.org"/&gt;

====Engine Braking Device====
A compression braking device installed on large motor vehicles to assist in reduction, or control, of vehicle speed.  When activated, the engine converts from a power source to a power absorber by converting the engine into an air compressor.

====Muffler====
Any device for the abatement of sound emission while permitting the transfer of gas.  A muffler is considered to be in good working order if the sound reduction is equal to, or greater than, that of the original equipment.

====Noise Disturbance====
Any sound or vibration which:
# may disturb or annoy reasonable persons of normal sensitivities or;
# causes, or tends to cause, an adverse effect on the public health and welfare or;
# endangers or injures people or;
# endangers or injures personal or real property.
This can also be defined as ''noise nuisance''.

====Place of Public Entertainment====
Any location, exterior, or interior, to a building that regularly permits public entrance for entertainment purposes.  For this purpose, “public” means citizens of all types, including but not limited to, children, and private or public employees.

====Plainly Audible Sound====
Any sound for which the information content is unambiguously communicated to the listener, such as, but not limited to, understandable speech, comprehension of whether a voice is raised or normal, repetitive bass sounds, or comprehension of musical rhythms, without the aid of any listening device.

====Powered Model Vehicle====
Any self-propelled airborne, water-borne, or land-borne, plane, vessel, or vehicle, which is not designed to carry persons, including, but not limited to, any model airplane, boat, car, or rocket.

====Real Property Boundary====
An imaginary line along the ground surface, and its vertical extension, which separates the real property owned by one person from that owned by another person, but not including intra-building real property divisions.

====Sound Reproduction Device====
Any device, instrument, mechanism, equipment or apparatus for the amplification of any sounds from any radio, phonograph, stereo, tape player, musical instrument, television, loudspeaker or other sound-making or sound-producing device or any device or apparatus for the reproduction or amplification of the human voice or other sound.

====Vibration Perception Threshold====
The minimum ground or structure borne vibrational motion necessary to cause a person of normal sensitivity to be aware of the motion through contact, hearing, or through visual observation of moving things.

===Ordinance Provisions for Stationary Sources in the United States===
there are three levels of regulation for stationary sound sources. The most basic is the general one associated with noise disturbance. (See Noise Disturbance below.) It is a very broad ''subjective immission'' control that has evolved from earlier disturbance of the peace provisions. Subjectivity can lead to arbitrary enforcement. The next level of regulation is less broad; it is an ''objective immission'' control that uses specific levels of sound considered to be a noise disturbance.  Arbitrary enforcement is reduced. (See Maximum Permissible Sound Levels below.) In both cases, however, the person creating the sound may not be aware that his actions are in violation.  The concept that a potential violator should have ''fair warning'' that his actions are in violation has led to provisions that address specific noise problems.  The sections below list those that are found in community noise ordinances.&lt;ref name="noisefree.org"/&gt;

====Air Conditioning, Heating and Pool Equipment====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control.  An evaluation of the noise disturbance is made at the listener without a sound level meter. This provision is mostly applied in residential zones such as homes, apartments and condominiums.  Albuquerque, NM (Article 9-9) requires that such units the maximum permissible sound levels (Se section below) and recommend that those units be placed away from other residential units or on roof tops to diminish impact.

====Airport and Airport Operations====
Community control of airport created noise is limited to those sounds ''not'' related to flight operations.  The community is able to control the land use around the airport however.

====Animals====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control.  Most relate to barking dogs and put an upper time limit for continuous sound from them.  New Jersey (Chapter 13:1G) considers a violation if the sound is continuous for more than 5 minutes or intermittent for more than 20 minutes.  They also consider it a defense to violation if the animal is provoked to bark. Connecticut (Chapter 442)exempts animal sounds while Anchorage, AK (Chapter 15.70) requires that continual violations permit the animal to be taken and put out for adoption.

====Authorized Outdoor Discharge of Firearms and Shooting Ranges====
This provision contains only a curfew since most states protect shooting ranges from liability for noise disturbance.  It can include a curfew requirement and a requirement for a public hearing if expansion of the range is desired.  The provision may prohibit other weapons such as rocket propelled projectiles but may exempt unpowered weapons such as arrows. South Carolina (title 31 Chapter 18) requires that a sign stating '''SHOOTING RANGE-NOISE AREA''' be placed on all primary roads. Arizona (ARS 17-602) places a curfew from 10pm to 7 am.  It also allows a tradeoff between the number of events and the maximum permitted sound level. New York (Chapter 150) also trades off overall levels with the duration of the sounds. Colorado (Article 25-12-109) declared that noise restrictions on shooting ranges is a detriment to public health, welfare, and morale.

====Condominiums and Apartments====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control. It is designed to limit the noise disturbance between living units as defined by an enforcement official.  One criterion used to evaluate that disturbance is use of ''plainly audible'' but at the location of the listener instead of at a specific distance.  However, Charlotte, NC (Sec. 15-69) limits indoor levels to 55&amp;nbsp;dB(A) be tween 9am to 9pm and 5&amp;nbsp;dB less at other times, but only from sound reproducing devices. Salt Lake Valley Health Department (Chapter 4), Minneapolis, MN (Chapter 389), and Albuquerque, NM (Article 9) use levels to existing ambient to define a violation. Albuquerque NM and Omaha, NE (Chapter 17) require that intruding sounds not be audible. Burlington, VT (Chapter 18) requires that renters be supplied with the city noise ordinance.

====Construction====
This provision can be both a ''subjective immission'' control and an ''objective emission'' control. Normally there are daily curfews and in some case weekend curfews.  The subjective aspect is to prevent noise disturbance in the adjacent community.  The objective aspect is to control the sound output of specific machines.  There are four major sources of site noise: (1) direct sound from continually operating equipment such as air compressors; (2) intermittent sound from equipment such as jack hammers;(3)backup alarms; and (4) hauling equipment such as trucks. Air compressor noise is regulated by CFR 204 and backup alarms are regulated by CFR 1926.  Boston, MA(Section 16-26.4)  permits construction on weekdays between 7am and 6 pm. Madison, WI (Chapter 24.08) limits sound levels to 88&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at 50 Feet. Miami, FL (Section 36-6) considers the noise a noise disturbance if it occurs between 6pm and 8am during the week and any time on Sunday. Dallas, TX (Section 30-2 (9)) permits construction in residential zones from 7am to 7pm on weekdays, from 9am to 7pm on Saturdays and Holidays, and prohibits construction on Sundays.  Albuquerque, New Mexico (Section 9-9-8) has a more complex control. It prohibits construction and demolition within 500 feet of noise sensitive properties (residences included) if the equipment sound control devices are less effective than the original equipment and if noise mitigation measures are not used when the levels exceed 90&amp;nbsp;dB (weighting not specified) or more than 80&amp;nbsp;dB during the day for three days.

====Domestic and Commercial Power Tools====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew.  It is used in residential zones as well as in commercial areas abutting residential zones.  Portland, OR (Title 18.10.030) has several ways to handle these tools. They separate ''outdoor'' and ''indoor'' use to different maximum levels at the property line. They have a night curfew and separate 5 HP tools from higher powered tools.  Madison WI (Chapter 24.08) has similar HP restrictions.  Albuquerque, NM (Title 9-9-7) restricts locations to more than 500 feet from residential and noise sensitive zones. Dallas, TX(Sec. 30-2) exempts lawn maintenance tools during daylight hours. Green Bay, WI (Subchapter II – 27.201) exempts snow removal tools.

====Explosives, Firearms, Impulsive Sources, and Similar Devices====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew.  It is for impulsive sound sources that are not associated with construction activities or shooting ranges. Many communities use the Maximum Permissible Sound Levels criterion (see below), with a correction for the character of the sound. Illinois () sets maximum blasting levels by land use zone and in three time categories. Portland, OR (Section 18.10.010.F) limits levels to 100&amp;nbsp;dB (peak) from 7am to 10pm and 80&amp;nbsp;dB (peak) from 10pm to 7 am.

====Fracking Operations====
Hydraulic Fracturing operations generate site sound as well as vehicle sound and several different provisions are required to control it.  Federal law regulates the levels of certain site machinery.  A ''subjective immission'' control or an ''objective immission'' control can be applied to surrounding neighborhoods. See maximum Permissible Sound Levels.  Motor vehicle sound is mostly off-site so vehicle noise regulations are applicable. See Motor Vehicles on a Public Right-of-way.
The State of New York has announced a statewide ban on such operations. Buffalo, NY and Pittsburgh, PA have announced a ban.  Colorado has numerous activities to stop fracking.

====Funerals====
This is a ''subjective emission'' control to reduce the excessive shouting and protests that can surround funeral proceedings.  It makes use of the ''plainly audible'' term and so adds a distance criterion.  There are certain groups, particularly those that object to involvement in foreign wars, who believe it is an obligation to disrupt and picket funerals, especially those of deceased military veterans.  This provision must not infringe on Constitutionally protected free speech. Illinois h(720 ILCS 5/26 6)has a comprehensive provision covering more aspects of this event than noise.  They failed to use “plainly audible” which is narrower than “audible”.  Utah(Section 76-9-108) restricts disruptive activity to beyond 200 feet.

====Loading and Unloading Operations====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew.  Operations in commercial facilities can impact adjacent residential zones. Los Angeles, CA (Section 114.03) places a curfew on such operations between 10pm and 7am but only if the source is within 200 feet of a residence. Chicago, IL (Section 11-4-2830) permits night operations unless they create a noise disturbance. Hammond, IN (Section 6.2.6) prohibits noise disturbance between 7pm and 7am.

====Maximum Permissible Sound Pressure Levels====
This provision is an ''objective immission'' control.  It requires the measurement of sound levels at or beyond a property line and its vertical extension. There are several methods for implementing such a provision:
# It may not permit any exceedence or may permit exceedence only for a percentage of the measurement period. 
# It may require the measurement method to be instantaneous, such as dB(A) or time-averaged, such as Energy Equivalent Level (Leq).
# It may be a fixed level limit, such as 55&amp;nbsp;dB(A), or it may be a level relative to the ambient sound, such as 5&amp;nbsp;dB(A) above the ambient.
# It may require measurement of the frequency spectrum, such as one octave bands, or A-weighting, such as dB(A).
# It may define different maximum levels based on zoning criteria, such as residential, commercial, or industrial.
# It may define different maximum levels based on time-of-day or day-of-week, such as reduced maxima during night hours or on weekends.
# It may require reduction of maximum levels based on the character of the sound, such as intermittent or impulsive.
# It may exempt certain classes of sound sources, such as shooting ranges, farm equipment, emergency equipment, railroads, or licensed activities.
most noise ordinances set maximum levels for two time periods: Day (7am to 10pm) and Night (10pm to 7am).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noisefree.org/Noise-Ordinance-Manual.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911031249/http://www.noisefree.org/Noise-Ordinance-Manual.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-11 |df= }} Appendix A&lt;/ref&gt; San Diego (Article 9.25)sets three periods:  Day (7am to 7pm), Evening (7pm to 10pm), and Night (10pm to 7am) and exempts industrial zones from time based restrictions.  Seattle, WA (Chapter 25.08) sets two time periods but changes 7am to 9am on weekends and holidays.  Several states have maximum permissible land use sound levels in dB(A). Most have Day and Night periods and three use categories: residential, Commercial and Industrial. Washington{{vague|state? D.C.?|date=September 2015}} (Chapter 70.107) sets maximum levels in dB(A) but allows 5&amp;nbsp;dB(A) more if the sound is only 15 minutes in an hour, or 10&amp;nbsp;dB(A) for 5 minutes in an hour.  Numerous cities have fixed levels, permitting excess levels for short times (e.g., Dallas, TX, Chapter 30) while others use Leq (Lincoln, NE, Chapter 8.24). Los Angeles, CA (Chapter XI) uses a relative level with a stated but ''presumed'' ambient.  New York City, NY (Chapter 19) requires Leq measurements to be made over one hour.  Atlanta, GA (){{vague|"()"|date=September 2015}} limits impulsive sound to 100&amp;nbsp;dB(C) at property lines, while most reduce the maximum level by 5&amp;nbsp;dB for pure tones and impulsive sounds.

====Motor Vehicle or Motorboat Repairs and Testing====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew.  If the activity is done in a residential zone, the Domestic Tools provision can be applied for the repairs, but this provision also is used for the testing phase of any repairs. Los Angeles, CA (Section 114.01) covers this violation in three ways.  The first is application of the ''noise disturbance'' provision in residential districts between the hours of 8 pm to 8 am.  The second is being ''plainly audible'' at a distance of 150 feet or more in residential districts between the hours of 8 pm to 8 am.  The third is exceeding the presumed ambient by 5&amp;nbsp;dB.  Hammond, IN (Section 6.2.7) prohibits this activity as a ''noise disturbance'' at any time.

====Noise Disturbance Prohibited====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control. This provision is generic in that it covers all events that are considered disturbing by a listener, with or without measurement.  The strength of this provision is that it covers situations not contemplated in a noise ordinance and can be used as backup for more specific provisions. The weakness is that it may not give ''fair warning'', may lead to arbitrary enforcement on the part of the regulator, or permit unreasonable demands by a listener.

====Noise Sensitive Zones====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control.  It is used to reduce levels of both stationary and vehicular sound sources around hospitals, schools, and other noise sensitive locations.  To provide ''fair warning'' visible signs must be posted.  It is possible to have an extensive list. For example, if churches are on the list and the community has many of them, signage, compliance, and enforcement can be a problem. In modern hospital environments, helicopter sound is exempt.

====Places of Public Entertainment====
This provision is an ''objective immision '' control.  It regulates the site of the sound source while the Sound Reproduction Devices section regulates the devices that create the sound.  It can regulate the sound levels received by ''involuntary'' listeners in the surrounding community as well as the sound levels received by ''voluntary'' listeners.  If the latter aspect is incorporated, limiting internal sound levels often resolves community noise impact. Los Angeles (Article 2, Section 112.06)requires warning signs and limits noise exposure to 95&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at any position normally occupied. Seattle, WA {Section 25.08.501} considers the sound emitted to be in violation if the sound is ''plainly audible'' within a dwelling from 10 pm to 7am; the need for a sound level meter is avoided. Chicago, IL {Section 11-4-2805} limits received sound levels to 55&amp;nbsp;dB(A) inside a residential dwelling unit but if the ambient is greater, the limit is 65&amp;nbsp;dB(A).  If outdoors, the limit is ''conversational level'' at 100 feet from the property line.  If the building is set back 20 feet from the property line, the allowable level is 84&amp;nbsp;dB(A)!  Both of Chicago’s limits apply from 10 pm to 8 am.  Salt Lake health Department, UT {Section 4.5.11.(vii)} sets the limit at 95&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at a position that would normally be occupied by a patron and 100&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at other positions. They also require a sign stating '''WARNING: SOUND LEVELS ON THIS PREMISE &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; MAY CAUSE PERMANENT HEARING DAMAGE. HEARING PROTECTION IS AVAILABLE'''.   Anchorage, AK (Section 15.70.060.B.12) sets maximum levels for any patron at 90&amp;nbsp;dB(A).

====Powered Unmanned Vehicles or Engines====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew.  It has been used to regulate the sound of model aircraft on both private and public property.  It applies to airborne, water-borne, and land-borne, unmanned vehicles.  It makes no distinction between model vehicles and full-size unmanned vehicles.  it applies also to the engines of those vehicles. Most regulations pertained to private unmanned vehicles, normally restricted to local open fields.  The development of drones with microphones, cameras and GPS has opened the door to commercial use over wider private and public properties.  Since federal preemption of drone use will likely occur, it is important for this provision to make the distinction. Salt Lake Health Department (Section 4.5.15) limits activity to 800 feet from a dwelling between 10 pm and 7 am, or if it cases a noise disturbance. Atlanta, GA (Section 74-136(b)) uses the ''plainly audible'' criterion across a residential property line, on a public property from 10 pm to 7 am on weekdays or from 10 pm to 10 am on weekends or holidays for any sound source.

====Propane Cannons====
This provision is a subjective immission control with a curfew. A propane cannon is used to keep animals and birds from destroying commercial crops.  In large fields, many are used and fired as frequent intervals. The sound levels are equivalent to the firing of a small artillery cannon.  The provision may contain requirements that limit the number of cannons permitted in a specific area and the number firings per hour for each cannon.  many states have a Right to Farm Act that limits nuisance litigation.  Florida() stated that it was a purpose of their act to protect reasonable agricultural activities conducted on farm land from nuisance suits.  They also added a section that limited expand of operations without consideration of noise. Fairfax County, VA (Sections 105-4-4 and 108-5-1) require agricultural operation to meet maximum land use regulations and prohibit unnecessary noise.  British Columbia Ministry of Agriculture (Farm Nuisance Noise document) have developed a comprehensive set of rules for cannon use.

====Public Address Systems====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control. It can contain a ''plainly audible'' term or a curfew.  It is applied to commercial facilities using a sound system to ''deliberately'' propagate mostly speech, but also music.  Most cities have provisions relevant to this subject.  Lakewood, CO (Sections 9.52.06 and 09.52.160) used ''plainly audible'' as a regulatory tool and prohibits the sounding of bells, or chimes from 10pm to 7am.  Charlotte, NC (Section 15-69(a)(4)) limits levels to 60&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at 50 feet from 9am to 9pm and 50&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at other times. Indianapolis, IN (Section 391-505) addresses broadcasts from aircraft. Connecticut (Section 22a-69-1.7) exempts bells, carillons, and chimes from religious facilities.

====Sound Reproduction Devices====
This provision is ''subjective immission'' control. It may contain a numerical level or a ''plainly audible'' term and a curfew. it is applied to specific sources of sound as opposed to any location at which the sound is created. It is applied primarily to ''amplified'' sound sources.  Older provisions listed several items such as televisions, phonographs, etc.  Changing the title to the above  addresses the real issue and allows for novel sound production devices.  Numerous communities have provisions for these devices; many use ''plainly audible'' as the criterion, such as Omaha, NE (Section 17-3) and Buffalo NY (Section 293-4)

====Stadiums and Outdoor Music Festivals====
This provision can be either a ''subjective or objective immission'' control with a curfew.  The subjective aspect relates to noise disturbance in the local community.  The objective aspect limits the acceptable sound level in the local community.  Illinois (Environmental Protection Act 415.25) exempts certain stadiums and exempts festivals, parades, or street fairs. Colorado Spring, CO (Section 9.8.101)  has similar exemptions, but limits the sound levels to 80&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at residential locations.

====Stationary Emergency Signaling Devices====
This provision is an ''emission'' control with a list of devices that are exempt. It can have a term that limits the time periods in which emergency alarms may be tested. It can have a term that limits the activation time of burglar or fire alarms.  Chicago, IL (Section 11-4-2815) limits the time for tests to 4 minutes between 9am and 5pm. Oregon (Chapter 467) prohibits sound when an emergency vehicle is stationary.

====Stationary non-Emergency non-Safety Signaling Devices====
This provision is an ''emission'' control that limits the activation period of alarms and restricts activation to a specific time-of-day or day-of-week. Los Angeles, CA () prohibits the sounding if the signal can be heard at 200 feet or more. Chicago, IL (Section 11-4-2820) considers the sound to be a noise disturbance in residential areas if the sound exceeds 5 minutes in any hour; steam whistles are exempt.  Albuquerque, NM (Section 9-9-12) restricts levels to 5&amp;nbsp;dB over the ambient at a property line and applies maximum permissible residential level as well as ''plainly audible'' restrictions at night.

====Street Sales====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew. Boston, MA (Section 16-2.2) prohibits street sales near schools or churches if there is a “disturbance of the peace”.  Hammond, IN (Section 6.2.4) places a curfew between 6 pm and 9 am.

====Tampering====
This provision prevents the modification of muffling devices that increase the emitted sound. It can also be used to prevent the commercial sale of such mufflers.  Most states and communities have prohibitions on tampering with noise reduction devices. whether stationary or moving.  Salt Lake County health Department (Section 4.5.10) prohibits modifications of mufflers that increase sound levels and prohibits tampering with noise rating labels.  See Section below on Adequate Mufflers.

====Vibration====
This provision is a ''subjective emission'' control.  Noise disturbance caused by vibration comes in three forms.  One is contact with vibrating surfaces, the second in auditory, and the third is the observation of surrounding objects movement.  Objectively regulating vibration is difficult so this provision makes use of the Vibration Perception Threshold.  Railroad caused vibration is preempted by federal law (CFR 201). Chicago, IL (Section 11-4-2910) uses the perception threshold method.   Dallas, TX requires measurement of low frequency vibration.  Maryland uses the definition of ''noise'' to include sound and vibration at sub-audible frequencies.

====Wind Turbines====
The sound created by wind turbines is caused by the blade rotation similar to aircraft propellers.  Because the rotation rate is low, the frequency is also low, but the large size of many can result in disturbing sound levels, particularly in high wind areas.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, A.L., Manwell, G.F., Wright, S. "Wind Turbine Acoustic Noise", University of Massachusetts at Amherst, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Most local control is done by advantageous site planning.  New Hampshire (Title LXIV, Section 674:63) sets a sound level limit of 55&amp;nbsp;dB when measured at the site property line, allowing for exceptional events, such as storms. Studies have declared that wind noise can have a negative effect on health.&lt;ref&gt;Anon, "Public Health Effects of Wind Turbines", Minnesota Department of Health, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ordinance Provisions for Moving Vehicles in the United States===
Stationary sources have fixed positions, so it is possible to define the listeners and therefore ''immission'' controls are appropriate.  Motor vehicles are moving sources so it is not possible to define any specific listeners so ''emission'' controls are appropriate.  There are exceptions to this distinction. Construction equipment, and some recreation vehicles, move within a bounded area and can be considered to be time varying fixed sources. Standing motor vehicles can radiate sufficient sound to create noise disturbance.  These must be treated by specific provisions.&lt;ref name="noisefree.org"/&gt;

====Adequate Mufflers or Sound Dissipation Devices====
This provision is an ''objective emission'' control.  Unlike the Tampering provision, this is specific to motor vehicles.  It requires that a vehicle muffler not create more sound than the original equipment which has been measured.  It prohibits any modification or replacement that increases the sound emission beyond that of the original equipment. It prohibits the sale of mufflers that do not meet original equipment standards.  Many states have requirements that a muffler ''shall be in good working order'' which is not specific enough.  California (Section 27150.1)) requires that a retail seller that sells a product in violation of the muffler regulation  must install a replacement muffler that meets the regulation and must reimburse the purchaser for the expense of replacement.

====Airboats and Hovercraft====
This provision is both an "objective emission'' control and a ''subjective immission'' control.  It can set a maximum sound level at a specified distance (typically 50 feet). It can have a curfew.  It can be based on ''noise disturbance'' in the community.  It can also require the use of ear protectors on passengers. Unlike motorboats, the sound generators on these vehicles are airborne, resulting in more noise impact.  Florida (Section 327.65) requires a maximum level of 90 DB(A).  Maine (Title 12 Section 13068-A)has three levels: operating, operating test and stationary test

====Engine Braking Devices====
This provision is an ''emission'' control. It can restrict brake use for only safety purposes and by defining restricted areas.  It can require that mufflers be maintained to keep emitted sound to that of the original equipment.  Common terminology is '''Jake brakes''' after the Jacobs Company. Milwaukee, Wi (Section 80-69) prohibits use within city limits.  Portland, OR (Section 18.10.020.B.3) prohibits use within 200 feet of a residence.  Albuquerque, NM posts signs requiring proper mufflers.

====Motorboats====
This provision is both an ''objective emission'' control and a ''subjective immission'' control.
Because they are moving sources, ''objective'' controls are appropriate for measurements on open waterways.  Many motorboats operate in bounding areas, such as small lakes or canals, with adjacent residential areas.  In this case, ''immission'' controls are appropriate. California (Section 654.05), Portland OR (Section 18.10.040), and Seattle, WA (Section 25.08.485) require ''immission'' measurements to be made at the shoreline. Many states require ''emission'' measurements to be made at 50 feet.

====Motor Vehicle Horns or Signaling Devices====
This provision is both a prohibition and an ''emission'' control. it limits to use for safety warning only..  It limits the sound level to a specific level at a prescribed distance.  This provision is intended to limit horn use to safety and to limit the use of excessively loud air horns or ''Rumbler'' or ''Howler'' horns. California prohibits a person operating a motor vehicle to wear a headset or earplugs on both ears. . Oregon (Section 820.370) prohibits signaling sound when an emergency vehicle is stationary or returning from an emergency

====Motor Vehicles on a Public Right-of-Way====
This provision is an ''objective emission'' control. It applies maximum sound levels to various categories of moving vehicles and for several vehicle speeds.  It is the backbone of vehicle sound emission regulations. It generally requires a measurement of A-weighted sound level of a moving vehicle at a specific distance from the vehicle path (normally 50 feet).  This provision has level restrictions on trucks over 10,000 GVW used locally and in interstate commerce.  It also covers motorcycles of two horsepower ratings, mopeds, and all other vehicles on public rights-of-way.  The federal government has set maximum levels for heavy trucks used in interstate commerce (40 CFR 202)and for motorcycles (40 CFR 205).  Most states and many cities  have maximum limits and they generally agree with federal standards where they apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noisefree.org/Noise-Ordinance-Manual.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911031249/http://www.noisefree.org/Noise-Ordinance-Manual.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-11 |df= }} Appendix B&lt;/ref&gt; The most common speed division is 35&amp;nbsp;mph.

====Motor Vehicle Racing Events====
This provision is an ''objective emission'' control. It can define the method of vehicle operation that is used to define the maximum permitted sound level.  It can have a curfew.  Some states exempt motor vehicle racing events from noise disturbance litigation or prosecution.  Arizona (Section 28-955.03) exempts racing motorcycles from maximum sound levels and muffler requirements. Illinois {Section 35.903} had detailed regulations on racing vehicles It required a 14&amp;nbsp;dB reduction in sound output, limited sound output at half mater to 115&amp;nbsp;dB(A), and no more than 105&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at 50 feet.

====Motor Vehicle Sound systems====
This provision is both an ''objective emission'' control, a ''subjective emission'' control, and a ''subjective immission'' for vehicles on a public right-of-way.  The first part limits the system sound level at a fixed distance. The second part uses the ''plainly audible'' definition for limiting the sound output.  The third part uses the ''noise disturbance'' definition to limit the impact on neighboring properties and can be applied within public transportation. The most restrictive application of the plainly audible laws says that the sound cannot be audible to anyone other than the vehicle occupants.  There are numerous state and community restrictions on vehicle sound systems. Louisiana prohibits the system from emitting sound outside of a vehicle.  Richmond, CA also prohibits the sound from being audible outside the vehicle.  Oregon prohibits sound systems being ''plainly audible'' at 50 feet. California prohibits sound systems that can be ''heard'' at 50 feet. Colorado Springs, CO, requires a measurement at 25 feet beyond the private property line or 25 feet from the source on public property; it does not specify a limiting level.  In Lakewood, CO it must not be ''plainly audible'' beyond 25 feet.  In Los Angeles, CA, it cannot be audible beyond 200 feet.  In Seattle, WA, it must not be ''plainly audible'' at 75 feet. Chicago restricts levels to less than ''clearly audible'' at 75 feet. Minneapolis, MN restricts levels to less than audible at 50 feet. Albuquerque, NM restricts ''plainly audible'' to 25 feet, but also applies their land use limits.  Cincinnati, OH restricts ''plainly audible'' to 50 feet.  Dallas, TX prohibits sound or vibration that is detectable at 30 feet, or that violates the land use regulations.  Houston, TX applies land use restrictions. Omaha, NE states the sound must not be audible at 100 feet.  Hammond, IN restricts ''plainly audible'' to 25 feet. New Jersey states the sound must not be ''plainly audible'' at 50 feet between 8 am and 10 pm and not ''plainly audible'' at 25 feet between 10 pm and 8 am.  Florida states the sound must not be ''plainly audible'' at 25 feet, but exempts business and political systems.  Oregon and Tennessee state that the sound must not be ''plainly audible'' beyond 50 feet, as does Fairbanks, AK. Rhode Island specifically addresses low frequency sound that can be heard 20 feet from a closed vehicle or 100 feet otherwise.  Salt Lake County Health Department, UT considers the sound a violation if it is ''plainly audible'' on a common carrier. Austin, TX states it must not be audible at 30 feet.

====Motor Vehicle Theft Alarms====
This provision is a ''subjective emission'' control with only an operational time limit. Los Angeles, CA () requires silencing in 5 minutes.  New York City, NY (Section 24.221(d)) requires automatic shut-off after 10 minutes and a prominent display of the local precinct number and telephone number.  Boston, MA (Section 16-26.2) considers it a violation if the alarm is plainly audible at 200 feet and is on more than 5 minutes.  Other states an communities have automatic shutoff times from 10 to 15 minutes.  Some communities have banned such alarms.

====Motor Vehicle Tire Squeal and Street Drag Racing====
This provision is  a ''subjective immission'' control. It is based on the ''noise disturbance'' from drag racing and tire squealing on public rights-of-way.  Illinois (625 ILCS 5/11-505) prohibits such activities.  Hammond, IN (Section 6.2.14) prohibits such activity if it creates a ''noise disturbance''.

====Railroads====
Railroad activity is subject to federal regulations. Most communities do not attempt to regulate train sound.  The level of train horns permitted by the Federal Railroad Administration sufficiently high that community impact occurs. One method to alleviate this sound is to have a community establish a '''quiet zone''' where the rail crossings meet federal safety standards so that horn use is not needed.

====Recreational Off-road Vehicles====
This provision is both an ''objective emission'' control and a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew. It can apply to both public and private properties.  Since these vehicles can move in large open areas, an ''objective'' control, limiting maximum sound levels at a fixed distance, is appropriate.  Since they also can move in bounded areas near residences, a ''subjective'' control is appropriate. Numerous states and cities have ''emission'' controls measured at 50 feet;  the most common level is 82&amp;nbsp;dB(A), which is similar to that for motor vehicles on public rights-of-way.  Colorado Springs, CO (Section 9.8.204.C) requires a minimum distance of 660 feet from residences. Portland, OR (Section 18.10.020.C) requires the area must be designated for recreational vehicle use.  Salt Lake health Department, UT (Section 4.5.10(x)) requires off-highway vehicles to be at least 800 feet from a dwelling during the day and has a curfew from 10 pm to 7 am.  They prohibit any ''noise disturbance'' and require sound levels to the less than 96&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at 50 feet.

====Recreational Snowmobiles====
This provision is both an ''objective emission'' control and a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew. It can apply to both public and private properties.  Since these vehicles can move in large open areas, an ''objective'' control, limiting maximum sound levels at a fixed distance is appropriate.  Since they also can move in bounded areas near residences, a ''subjective'' control is appropriate.  Numerous states and communities have ''objective'' controls; the most common maximum level is 78&amp;nbsp;dB(A). Federal law (36 CFR 2.18) regulates snowmobiles on federal property at 78&amp;nbsp;dB(A), so states and communities are free to regulate snowmobile sound levels on their property. Lincoln NE (Section 8.24.110) limits levels to 78&amp;nbsp;dB(A).	Maine (Section 13112, Chapter 937) exempts snowmobiles at sanctioned racing events.  Illinois (625 ILCS 40 Sec. 4-4)does also.

====Refuse Collection Vehicles====
This provision is an ''objective emission'' control and a ''subjective'' control. It can place a maximum sound level at a specific distance for the loudest operation.  It can set a curfew, or it can be based on ''noise disturbance'' in residential zones. Los Angeles, CA (Section 113.01) has a time limit that applies only within 200 feet of any residential building.  Chicago, IL (Section 11-4-2900) considers any noise it a noise disturbance if the activity occurs between 8pm to 8am.  Salt Lake City, UT (Section 4.5.6) considers it a noise disturbance if the activities occur between 10 pm to 7 am and closer than 800 feet from a dwelling.   Atlanta, GA (Section 74-137(a)(5)prohibits collection between 9pm and am on a weekend day or legal holiday, except by permit. In Maryland, refuse collection is exempt during daytime hours and must meet maximum land use levels [55&amp;nbsp;dB(A)] in residential zones at  night.

====Standing Motor Vehicles====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control. It sets a time limit on engine activity. It can also place a curfew on any engine activity. e. In Salt Lake City, UT (Section 4.5.10(xi)) it is considered a ''noise disturbance'' if the operation lasts more than 15 minutes.  Dallas, TX (Section 30-3.1) applies the code to vehicles over 14,000 GVWR; they must be more than 300 feet from a residential zone and there is a 10-minute maximum.  They also provide a list of idling vehicles that are exempt from prosecution such as buses or active concrete trucks.  Hammond, IN (Section 6.2.10) limits operation to 3 minutes in an hour for vehicles over 14,000 GVWR in either public or private property. It exempts buses and taxis. Massachusetts allows idling no more than 5 minutes.

==Building codes==
In the case of construction of new (or remodeled) apartments, condominiums, hospitals and hotels, many U.S. states and cities have stringent [[building code]]s with requirements of acoustical analysis, in order to protect building occupants from exterior noise sources and sound generated within the building itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Noise Control Manual for Residential Buildings |last=Harris |first=David A. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1997 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |location=New York |isbn=978-0-07-026942-2 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to exterior noise, the codes usually require measurement of the exterior acoustic environment in order to determine the performance standard required for exterior building skin design.

The architect can work with the acoustical scientist to arrive at the best cost-effective means of creating a quiet interior (normally 45 [[decibel|dB]]).  The most important elements of design of the building skin are usually: [[insulated glazing|glazing]] (glass thickness, double pane design, etc.), roof material, caulking standards, chimney baffles, exterior door design, mail slots, attic ventilation ports and mounting of through the wall air conditioners.  A special case of building skin design arises in the case of [[aircraft noise]], where the FAA has funded extensive work in residential retrofit.

Regarding sound generated inside the building, there are two principal types of transmission. First, airborne sound travels through walls or floor/ceiling assemblies and can emanate from either human activities in adjacent living spaces or from mechanical noise within the building systems.  Human activities might include voice, amplified sound systems or  animal noise.  Mechanical systems are elevator systems, [[boiler]]s, [[refrigeration]] or [[air conditioning]] systems, [[Electrical generator|generator]]s and trash compactors.  Since many of these sounds are inherently loud, the principle of regulation is to require the wall or ceiling assembly to meet certain performance standards (typically Sound Transmission Class of 50), which allows considerable attenuation of the sound level reaching occupants.

The second type of interior sound is called [[Impact insulation class|Impact Insulation Class]] (IIC) transmission.  This effect arises not from airborne transmission, but rather from transmission of sound through the building itself.  The most common perception of IIC noise is from footfall of occupants in living spaces above.  This type of noise is somewhat more difficult to abate, but consideration must be given to isolating the floor assembly above or hanging the lower ceiling on resilient channel.  Commonly a performance standard of IIC equal to 50 is specified in building codes.  California has generally led the U.S. in widespread application of building code requirements for sound transmission; accordingly, the level of protection for building occupants has increased markedly in the last several decades.

==U.S. occupational safety regulations==
The U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] has established maximum noise levels for occupational exposure, beyond which mitigation measures or [[personal protective equipment]] is required.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Washington, D.C. [http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&amp;p_id=9735 "Occupational noise exposure."] ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{CodeFedReg|29|1910|95}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent years, [[Buy Quiet]] programs and initiatives have arisen in an effort to combat occupational noise exposures. These programs promote the purchase of quieter tools and equipment and encourage manufacturers to design quieter equipment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/buyquiet/default.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Persian Empire|Persian]]-[[Sassanide]] art patterns''' have similarities with the art of the [[Bulgars]], [[Khazars]], and Saka-[[Scythians]], and have recurred in Asia. They predominantly feature motifs of fighting animals. Gold was frequently used as a base for their art creations.

== Patterns ==
The characteristic patterns of [[Empire|Persian]]-[[Sassanide]] art exhibit similarities to the art of the [[Bulgars]],&lt;ref&gt;Bulgarian's Treasures from the past by Ivan Venedikov, Sava Boyadjiev and Dimiter Kartalev, Foreign Languages Press Sofia 1965, pp. 345-55&lt;/ref&gt; [[Khazars]], and Saka-[[Scythian]], and have recurred at different locations in the [[Central Asia]] region. A "[[griffin]] fighting an [[elk]]" motif from the [[Treasure of Nagyszentmiklós]], found in 1799 in what is today [[Romania]], bears similarities with another griffin &amp; elk motif discovered in the tombs of [[Hsiung-nu]]&lt;ref&gt;The Empire of the Steppes, a History of Central Asia by Rene Grousset (transl. by Naomi Walford), Rutgers University Press, 2005, p.25&lt;/ref&gt; (early [[Huns]], also [[Xiongnu]]) during Colonel [[Pyotr Kuzmich Kozlov]]&lt;ref&gt;Buddha: Radiant Awakening by Jackie Menzies, Sydney, Art Gallery of New South Wales, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wildlife of the Tibetan Steppe by George B. Schaller, University Of Chicago Press, 2000, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; expedition (1907–09) near [[Ulan Bator|Urga]] (Outer [[Mongolia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Discoveries of the Kozlov Expedition by W. Perceval Yetts, he Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs, Vol. 48, No. 277 (Apr., 1926), pp. 168-185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Pazirik Burial of Altai by Eugene A. Golomshtok, M. P. Griaznov in American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 37, No. 1 (Jan. - Mar., 1933), pp. 30-45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Recent Russian Archaeological Exploration by W. E. D. Allen in The Geographical Journal, Vol. 69, No. 3 (Mar., 1927), pp. 262-264&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[gold]] symbolization of "animals-in-fight" has been also found in the vicinity of the city of [[Turpan]],&lt;ref&gt;The Old Silk Road - From Xi'an to Pamir, Chapter XIII: A Tour of Turpan by Bi Yading, Chinese Intercontinental Press (CIP) 2003, p.121 ({{ISBN|7-5032-2125-9}})&lt;/ref&gt; the principal crossroad of the northern [[Silk Road]]. [[Gold]]en "animals-in-fight" have also been identified as 3rd – 2nd century B.C. [[Mongolia]] (or southern [[Siberia]]), being characteristic of [[Hsiung-nu]] or [[Xiongnu]].

==The Art of the Nomads==

The early history of the [[Nomads]] is not well recorded, which changed after their contact with cultures possessing written history. [[Nomadic people]] of the vast steppes of [[Asia]] were a major force in history.&lt;ref&gt;The Perilous Frontier by Thomas J. Barfield, lackwell Publishers, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Their power was not in the empires they built, but rather the turmoil they created among [[ancient civilizations]] such as [[China]] or [[Persia]], impacting their historical development substantially.&lt;ref&gt;Warriors of the Steppe by Erik Hildinger, De Capo Press, 1997, pp. 57-92&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the [[nomads]] ranged widely, forever moving on for sake of richer grazing for their horses and sheep.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} [[Nomad|Migrations]] were often seasonal. Their skill at extracting [[gold]] was unprecedented.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In summer, during the tribe's seasonal migration, a [[Wool|fleece]] would be weighted on a riverbed to collect particles of [[alluvial]] [[gold]]. Upon the tribes' return, the [[Wool|fleece]] would be sheared, burned, and a [[gold]] ingot the size of a horse's hoof would result.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The ''tay tayak'' (the horse's hoof) was a unit of gold for a long period, which was used as a measure of an amount of golden metal rather than money, since gold was not fabricated as currency.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Using gold was a spiritual practice, as emblems of priestly office, prizes for physical prowess in ritual sport, or as adornment of the sacral ceremony of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Kazakhstan, Coming of Age by Michael Fergus and Janar Jandosova, Stacey International 2003, p.106 ({{ISBN|1-900988-615}})&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22684">{{short description|The relationship between plants and animals and a polar environment}}
'''Polar ecology''' is the relationship between plants and animals in a polar environment. Polar environments are in the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] regions. Arctic regions are in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and it contains land and the islands that surrounds it. [[Antarctica]] is in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] and it also contains the land mass, surrounding islands and the ocean. [[Polar region]]s also contain the subantarctic and [[subarctic]] zone which separate the polar regions from the [[temperate region]]s. Antarctica and the Arctic lie in the [[polar circle]]s. The polar circles are not visible on the earth but it is shown on maps to be the areas that receives less sunlight due to less radiation. These areas either receive sunlight ([[midnight sun]]) or shade ([[polar night]]) 24 hours a day because of the [[Earth#Axial tilt and seasons|earth's tilt]]. Plants and animals in the polar regions are able to withstand living in harsh weather conditions but are facing environmental threats that limit their survival.

==Climate==
{{see also|Polar meteorology}}
[[Polar climate]]s are cold, windy and dry. Because of the lack of [[precipitation]] and low temperatures the Arctic and Antarctic are considered the world's largest [[desert]]s or [[Polar desert]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geology.com/records/largest-desert.shtml The World's Largest Deserts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/types/ Types of Seserts]&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the [[radiation]] from the sun that is received is reflected off the snow making the polar regions cold.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 23&lt;/ref&gt; When the radiation is reflected, the heat is also reflected. The polar regions reflect 89-90% of the sun radiation that the earth receives.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 24&lt;/ref&gt; And because Antarctica is closer to the sun at [[Apsis|perihelion]], it receives 7% more radiation than the Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/152724/ Factors affecting surface ultraviolet radiation levels in the Arctic]&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the polar region, the atmosphere is thin. Because of this the [[Ultraviolet|UV radiation]] that gets to the atmosphere can cause fast [[sun tanning]] and [[Photokeratitis|snow blindness]].

Polar regions are dry areas; there is very little precipitation due to the cold air. There are some times when the [[humidity]] may be high but the [[water vapor]] present in the air may be low. Wind is also strong in the polar region. [[Wind]] carries snow creating [[blizzard]] like conditions. Winds may also move small organisms or vegetation if it is present.&lt;ref name="stone44"&gt;Stonehouse, 44&lt;/ref&gt; The wind blows the snow making [[snowdrift]]s or snow dunes which may exist even in the spring when the snow is thawing out.&lt;ref name="stone44"/&gt; It is hard for meteorologists to measure the amount of precipitation. This is because it is expensive to take care of the stations that collect weather data and it hard for them to measure snow fall amounts because the wind blows the snow too much to calculate exact amounts.

The temperatures are similar between the Arctic and Antarctic. The temperatures in the Arctic are different depending on the location. Temperatures in the Arctic have a higher range than in the Antarctic. Temperatures can range as much as {{convert|100|C-change|0}}. Along the coast in the Arctic temperatures average {{Convert|-30|to|-40|C}} in December, January and February.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 48&lt;/ref&gt; The ice melts along the coast during the summer months which are around June, July and August and the temperature may rise a few degrees above freezing causing there to be some vegetation. During these same months in the northern regions there will be 24 hours of daylight. Arctic regions also receive a lot of snowfall. The [[Arctic Basin]] has snow 320 days out of the year while the Arctic Seas have snow cover 260 days a year.&lt;ref name="mel14"/&gt; The thickness of the snow averages {{Convert|30|–|40|cm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="mel14"&gt;Melnikov, 14&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greenland]], temperatures have an average temperature of {{convert|-40|C}} in the winter and in the summer the temperatures reach {{Convert|-12|C}}. Iceland on the other hand is in a subarctic region meaning it is near the temperate zone. Because of this the temperatures are above the freezing point throughout much of the year. In Russia temperatures are extremely cold. In [[Verkhoyansk]], Siberia it has reached the coldest temp of {{Convert|-68.8|C}} in the Northern Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 51&lt;/ref&gt; The temperatures in the summer in Siberia can get to {{Convert|36|C}}.

In the Antarctic there is less temperature variations. Temperatures only range by around {{Convert|30|C-change|0}}. The winter months are May till September while the summer months will be October till April. The sun reappears in September which then starts the 24 hours of daylight. The temperatures are different between the plateaus in Antarctica and between the coasts. The plateaus are the coldest regions of Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 52&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer months there is low precipitation with light winds. [[Vostok Station|Vostok]] has received the lowest temperature worldwide getting as low as {{Convert|-88.3|C}} in 1960. The West Antarctica plateau reaches snow levels of around {{Convert|30|cm|abbr=on}}. This area is also warmer but it receives the heaviest snow and receives more wind. Because of the cold desert like conditions on the plateaus there are very little plants and animals. Some species of birds though have been seen.

On the coasts in the summer there is more wind, and it is cloudier. Coasts with higher latitudes have a temperature of {{Convert|-24|C}} in the winter months whereas lower latitude coasts get down to {{Convert|-20|C}}. Coastal areas may receive {{Convert|40|cm|abbr=on}} or more of snow.

==Water==
[[Water]] is an important part of human survival. Because of its cold temperature much of the earth's water comes from the polar regions. 90% of the world's water comes from the [[Antarctic ice sheet|Antarctic ice cap]] although a lot of this water is not used.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 106&lt;/ref&gt; Water environments are important for many species around the world. Many bacteria thrive there as well as algae and flora.

Many of the ponds or lakes in polar regions are frozen over or snow covered for most of the year. Larger lakes thaw out around the edges during the warmer months while the smaller lakes thaw entirely. There are few rivers in the polar regions. The Arctic has more rivers compared to Antarctica. The regions also have ponds. The ponds that attract birds tend to be rich in nutrients. This is because of the bird droppings or bird feathers.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 109&lt;/ref&gt; There are two different types of lakes in polar regions including Arctic lakes and Antarctic lakes. Of the Arctic lakes they include glacial lakes and permafrost lakes.

The polar regions include the [[Arctic Ocean]] and the [[Southern Ocean]]. The Arctic Ocean covers {{Convert|14000000|km2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 127&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring the ice covers an area of {{Convert|5000000|-|8000000|km2|abbr=on}} and in the winter it is twice that. In this area it is never totally ice-covered. This is due to the winds breaking up the ice. Because of these cracks in the ice there is more biological productivity in the ocean.

The Southern Ocean is {{Convert|28000000|km2|abbr=on}}. This ocean contains the [[Weddell Sea]] and [[Ross Sea]]. The ocean contains large packs of ice that surrounds Antarctica.

==Land==
Because of the cold weather it is hard for plants to grow. Frozen ground covers most of the polar regions for the majority of the year. [[Permafrost]] reaches a thickness of {{Convert|600|-|1000|m|abbr=on}} deep. Large amounts of permafrost can lead to poor water drainage. Due to the permafrost the water in the soil remains frozen for most of the year. In the summer the top of the permafrost may be covered with water due to melting in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 69&lt;/ref&gt; Weathering is also common in polar regions. There is rubble from rocks that are scattered on the land due to movement of [[glacier]]s. Also quick temperature change causes weathering.

The main type of soil in the polar regions is ahumic soil.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=00v6iF3X4gEC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;lpg=PA171&amp;dq=Ahumic+soil&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=s2_LbB1b0v&amp;sig=MqeXHlk65XcGD5L-3ubQDNEHAGs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kHh1Uo3jHuKbiAK5qoDADg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ahumic%20soil&amp;f=false Antarctic Soils and Soil Forming Processes: J. C. F. Tedrow, Editor]&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the cold desert soil. This soil consists of sand that is frozen. These soils tend to not have a lot of vegetation but [[bacteria]] has been found.

The other type of soil is organic soil. This type of soil is found in areas that are warmer and have more moisture. Some vegetation that lives here are [[algae]], [[Fungus|fungi]] and [[moss]]es. One type of organic soil is the brown soils, which have drainage.

== Animals ==
Due to the harsh weather in the polar regions, there are not many animals. The animals that do exist in the polar region are similar between the Antarctic and Arctic regions. The animals do differ by the temperature. In the Arctic some invertebrates include spiders, mites, mosquitoes and flies. In warmer areas of the polar regions moths, butterflies and beetles can be found. Some of the larger animals that exist are foxes, wolves, rabbits, hares, polar bears, [[Reindeer|reindeer/caribou]]. There are various bird species that have been spotted in the Arctic. Eight species of birds reside on the polar [[tundra]] year round while 150 breed in the Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 96&lt;/ref&gt; The birds that do breed go to the Arctic between May and July. One of the known birds is the [[snowy owl]], which has enough fat on it to be able to survive in the cold temperatures.

In the Antarctic some invertebrates that exist are mites, fleas and ticks. Antarctica is the only continent that does not have a land mammal population.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 105&lt;/ref&gt; There are also no birds that reside in Antarctica. Though, it has been known that various birds from South America have been spotted in Antarctica.

For animals to be able to live in the polar region they have to have adaptations which allow them to live in the cold and windy environments. These animals have originated with these adaptations, and animals that live in these regions are accumulating adaptations to be able to live in this type of environment. Some of these adaptations may be to be big and insolated, have a lot of fur, and to be darker. Also, many animals live in groups to be able to protect themselves from the cold. Animals also tend to be [[Homeothermy|homeotherms]] which are animals that maintain a high temperature.&lt;ref&gt;177{{Clarify|date=November 2013|reason=Who is this?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller invertebrates also tend to be smaller in polar regions which helps them conserve energy.

There are also many different animals that live in the sea water near polar regions. [[Squid]]s are one animal that live in both Antarctica and the Arctic. They are the food source for other large animals such as the male [[sperm whale]].&lt;ref&gt;Fogg, 202&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a wide variety of fish in the polar regions. [[Arctogadus glacialis|Arctic cod]] is a major species in the Arctic. [[Halibut]], [[cod]], [[herring]], and [[Alaska pollock]] (walleye pollock) are some other types of fish. In Antarctica there is not a lot of diversity among the fish; there is a lot of the same kind. [[Antarctic silverfish]] and [[lanternfish]] are some examples of fish that live in Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;Fogg, 204&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pinniped|Seals]] are also found in polar regions and number around 2.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;Fogg, 206&lt;/ref&gt; They are known to breed on land in the polar regions. [[Whale]]s are also in the polar regions and can be found near the surfaces of water where they prey.

There are also birds that breed in the polar regions. In the Arctic, 95% of the birds breeding here consist of only four different species. These include the [[northern fulmar]], [[kittiwake]], the [[little auk]] and the [[thick-billed murre]]. These birds breed here when the ice starts to thaw and when there is cracks in the ice so the birds are able to feed. In the Antarctic there are two different birds that live there including the [[penguin]] and the [[procellariiformes]].

== Vegetation ==
There is a wide source of vegetation in the polar region but there are few species in common in the southern and northern polar regions. The Arctic consists of desert and tundra vegetations. The desert vegetation consists of algae, [[lichen]]s, and mosses. Lichens are the most dominant plants. The ground is bare with patchy cover of lichens and mosses.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 83&lt;/ref&gt; Flowering plants are also seen but not as common. It only contains 60 species of flowering plants. The Arctic tundra vegetation also consists of lichens and mosses, but it includes shrubs, [[Poaceae|grasses]] and [[forb]]s as well. The amount of vegetation in the tundra consists on how much sun, or snow cover is in the area. The vegetation in this area may grow as tall as {{Convert|50|cm|abbr=on}}. In the southern part of the Arctic there tend to be more shrubs whereas the northern parts there is less plant cover. In wet areas of the tundra there is tussock grasses and cotton grasses. In moist areas there are short grasses, mosses, [[willow]]s, and [[birch]]es.

The Antarctic vegetation consists of algae or lichens, and some bacteria and fungi. Mosses and lichens dominate though. The algae and lichens grow where there is moisture, and they hide in cracks to be protected from the wind. The dominate grassland is the tussock. These grasses get to be {{Convert|2|m|abbr=on}} high, so they provide habitat for many [[mammal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Fogg, 96&lt;/ref&gt; Of the {{convert|14000000|km2|abbr=on}} of land that makes up Antarctic, less than 2% of it does not have snow or ice.&lt;ref&gt;Bergstrom, 161&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of a type of vegetation is a [[crustose]] lichen. These lichens are found in moist areas that are hidden from wind. They hide on the surface of rocks in the cracks. They survive off the water that melts from above. These lichen occur in [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]], as well as Greenland and IceLand These lichens can be red or orange colored and are known to defoliate rocks.&lt;ref&gt;72 {{Clarify|date=November 2013|reason=Who is this?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Threats ==
There exist many threats to the polar regions. One threat is whaling. Whaling started in the 16th century. People hunted whales to sell the meat. By 1925 the number of whales being killed rose from 14,000 to 40,000. The [[International Whaling Commission]] tried to stop whaling in the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 192&lt;/ref&gt; but was unsuccessful.

[[Overfishing]] is another threat to the polar regions. In the [[Bering Sea]] there is a lot of fishing due to the high populations of halibut and Alaskan Pollock. Around the 1970s [[krill]] began to become a popular [[crustacean]] to catch. The [[Soviet Union]] started advertising food with krill in it and they started overfishing krill. It has been estimated that 40 tonnes of krill per hour were caught during this time.&lt;ref&gt;Fogg, 221&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, the [[exclusive economic zone]] was established. This said that a certain country can fish {{convert|200|nmi|abbr=on}} off the shore. The country is now able to control who fishes in their EEZ area. But the EEZ has been unsuccessful.

Another threat is [[pollution]]. There are many land and water areas within the polar regions that are contaminated. This can be due to the transport of oil by large ships. [[Siberia]] is one example of a place that has had major pollution in its rivers.&lt;ref&gt;Nuttall, 529&lt;/ref&gt;

Depletion on the [[ozone layer]] is one more threat. An [[ozone hole]] has been detected above Antarctica. The cause of the depletion of the ozone layer is due to [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s and other [[greenhouse gas]]es. The other main reason is due to man made gases that are released into the atmosphere. There are many environmental effects due to this because the gases that are being released five times faster than they are destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 31&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Global warming]] is also having effect on the Arctic and Antarctic regions. Global warming is causing the temperature on the earth to increase. In ''Plan B 2.0'' [[Lester R. Brown]] talks about how the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 70&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to say that the temperature in the Arctic region has increased by {{Convert|3|-|4|C-change|0}} within the last half century. And with the increase in temperatures some worry that this will cause the sea level to rise. Scientists believe that if the [[Greenland ice sheet]] melts then the sea level could rise by {{Convert|23|ft|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 71&lt;/ref&gt; The melting of this [[ice sheet]] or others could have an effect on [[ocean current]]s. It could cause lower temperatures in northern North America. Rising of the sea level will also impact coastal areas. One example is in [[Bangladesh]]. If there was a {{Convert|1|m|abbr=on}} increase in sea level then millions of people would have to migrate from the coast. Global warming is also affecting Antarctica. The [[Larsen Ice Shelf]] or Larsen A is an ice sheet on the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. The sheet broke in 1995, and then in 2000 an [[iceberg]] that is {{convert|4250|sqmi|abbr=on}} broke off the [[Ross Ice Shelf]] in Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 72&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 Larsen B, which was {{Convert|5500|km2|abbr=on}}, broke off.

Global warming affects plants and animals. For plants, the warmer temperatures induce stress on the plants.&lt;ref&gt;Marchand&lt;/ref&gt; For animals, there has been a decrease in the number of [[polar bear]]s in the [[Hudson Bay]] area.&lt;ref name="sti294"/&gt; Since 1981, the polar bear population has been declining. This is because global warming causes the ice to break up faster so the polar bears are going to the coasts when there are poor conditions.&lt;ref name="sti294"&gt;Stirling, 294&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation efforts==
Whoever owns the land is responsible or managing it. And the owners of the land differ between the Antarctic and Arctic and also within the polar regions. In the Arctic, there are six nations that own the land about 60°N. These nations include: Canada, [[Russia]], [[Finland]], [[United States|USA]], [[Denmark]], [[Iceland]] and [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 193&lt;/ref&gt; There have been [[Arctic cooperation and politics|international treaties]] set up so there are no disputes. These nations have also have set their government to manage the land properly. They have set up [[national park]]s, [[Wilderness area|land for wilderness]], and also land for research. In the polar regions there have been laws set up to manage the number of visitors. There have been rules set up allowing only a certain amount of mining done and other measures to protect the environment from damages.

In the Antarctic the owners of the land are less clear. Some areas of Antarctica are controlled by the French, while other areas are controlled by [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[United Kingdom|UK]].&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 194&lt;/ref&gt; Whoever owns Antarctic is still unclear therefore many other countries have put out scientific stations. The [[Antarctic Treaty System]] of 1961 was established to make sure all the conflicts were resolved about who owned the land. This and other treaties have shown interest in helping to conserve the Antarctic region. All of these countries have conservation laws. These laws manage the amount of hunting in the area, monitor invasive species, and control burning and settlement.

==Still unexplored?==
In a [[meta-analysis]] of the published work in [[aquatic ecosystem]]s since the term [[biodiversity]] appeared in the bibliography, the Arctic and Antarctic Polar regions were found to still be unexplored. In addition, the north Pacific Ocean (Pacific Northeast and [[Pacific Northwest]]), still has few citations in comparison to its large size. This limits our perception of the world's [[Aquatic biodiversity research|aquatic biodiversity]]. Consequently, we do not have sufficient information about biodiversity in most places on earth. Even though biodiversity declines from the equator to the poles in [[terrestrial ecosystem]]s, this is still a hypothesis to be tested in aquatic and especially [[marine ecosystem]]s where causes of this phenomenon are unclear. In addition, particularly in marine ecosystems, there are several well stated cases where diversity in higher latitudes actually increases.&lt;ref&gt;Moustakas et al. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the lack of information on biodiversity of Polar Regions prevents scientific conclusions on the distribution of the world's aquatic biodiversity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16000">'''Post-postmodernism''' is a wide-ranging set of developments in [[critical theory]], [[philosophy]], [[architecture]], [[art]], [[literature]], and [[culture]] which are emerging from and reacting to [[postmodernism]]. Another similar recent term is [[metamodernism]].

==Periodization==
Most scholars would agree that [[modernism]] began around 1900 and continued on as the dominant cultural force in the intellectual circles of Western culture well into the mid-twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Compare, for example:&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book|last=Childs|first=Peter|title=Modernism|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=New York|year=2008|isbn=978-0-415-41544-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-v8SXB4l7kcC|page=18}}: "[modernism] is [...] primarily located in the years 1890-1930 [...]"&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=Tim|title=Modernism: A Cultural History|publisher=[[Polity Press]]|location=Cambridge|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7456-2983-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3k_C-1NZ4YYC&amp;dq=isbn=0-7456-2983-0|page=24}}: "[modernism] can be defined as a series of international artistic movements in the period 1900-40 [...]."&lt;/ref&gt; Like all eras, modernism encompasses many competing individual directions and is impossible to define as a discrete unity or totality. However, its chief general characteristics are often thought to include an emphasis on "radical aesthetics, technical experimentation, spatial or rhythmic, rather than chronological form, [and] self-conscious reflexiveness"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Childs|first=Peter|title=Modernism|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=New York|year=2008|isbn=978-0-415-41544-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-v8SXB4l7kcC|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the search for authenticity in human relations, abstraction in art, and utopian striving. These characteristics are normally lacking in postmodernism or are treated as objects of irony.
{{Postmodernism}}
[[Postmodernism]] arose after World War II as a reaction to the perceived failings of modernism, whose radical artistic projects had come to be associated with [[totalitarianism]]&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Groys, Boris: ''The Total Art of Stalinism'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; or had been assimilated into mainstream culture. The basic features of what we now call postmodernism can be found as early as the 1940s, most notably in the work of [[Jorge Luis Borges]].&lt;ref&gt;See Barth, John: “[[The Literature of Exhaustion]].” ''The Atlantic Monthly'', August 1967, pp. 29-34.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most scholars today would agree that postmodernism began to compete with modernism in the late 1950s and gained ascendancy over it in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., for example, Huyssen, Andreas: ''After the Great Divide. Modernism, Mass Culture, Postmodernism''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1986, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, postmodernism has been a dominant, though not undisputed, force in art, literature, film, music, drama, architecture, history, and continental philosophy. Salient features of postmodernism are normally thought to include the ironic play with styles, citations and narrative levels,&lt;ref&gt;See Hutcheon, Linda: ''A Poetics of Postmodernism. History, Theory, Fiction''. New York: Routledge, 1988, pp. 3-21; McHale, Brian: ''Postmodern Fiction'', London: Methuen, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; a metaphysical skepticism or [[nihilism]] towards a "[[grand narrative]]" of  Western culture,&lt;ref&gt;See Lyotard, Jean-François, ''The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge'', Minneapolis: University of Minneapolis Press 1984&lt;/ref&gt; a preference for the virtual at the expense of the real (or more accurately, a fundamental questioning of what 'the real' constitutes)&lt;ref&gt;See Baudrillard, Jean: “[[Simulacra and Simulation]]s.” In: ''Jean Baudrillard. Selected Writings''. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1988, pp. 166-184.&lt;/ref&gt; and a "waning of affect"&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, Fredric: ''Postmodernism or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism''. Durham: Duke University Press 1991, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; on the part of the subject, who is caught up in the free interplay of virtual, endlessly reproducible signs inducing a state of consciousness similar to schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, Fredric: ''Postmodernism or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism''. Durham: Duke University Press 1991, pp. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 1990s there has been a small but growing feeling both in popular culture and in academia that postmodernism "has gone out of fashion."&lt;ref&gt;Potter, Garry and Lopez, Jose (eds.): ''After Postmodernism: An Introduction to Critical Realism''. London: The Athlone Press 2001, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been few formal attempts to define and name the era succeeding postmodernism, and none of the proposed designations has yet become part of mainstream usage.

==Definitions==
Consensus on what constitutes an era can not be easily achieved while that era is still in its early stages. However, a common theme of current attempts to define post-postmodernism is emerging as one where faith, trust, dialogue, performance, and sincerity can work to transcend postmodern [[irony]]. The following definitions, which vary widely in depth, focus, and scope, are listed in the chronological order of their appearance.

===Turner's ''post-postmodernism''===
In 1995, the landscape architect and urban planner [[Tom Turner]] issued a book-length call for a post-postmodern turn in urban planning.&lt;ref&gt;''City as Landscape: A Post Post-modern View of Design and Planning'', (Taylor &amp; Francis: London 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Turner criticizes the postmodern credo of “anything goes” and suggests that “the built environment professions are witnessing the gradual dawn of a post-Postmodernism that seeks to temper reason with faith.”&lt;ref&gt;''City as Landscape: A Post Post-modern View of Design and Planning'', (Taylor &amp; Francis: London 1995), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Turner argues for the use of timeless organic and geometrical patterns in urban planning. As sources of such patterns he cites, among others, the Taoist-influenced work of the American architect [[Christopher Alexander]], [[gestalt psychology]]  and the [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Carl Jung]]’s concept of [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]]. Regarding terminology, Turner urges us to “embrace post-Postmodernism – and pray for a better name.”&lt;ref&gt;''City as Landscape: A Post Post-modern View of Design and Planning'', (Taylor &amp; Francis: London 1995), p. 10; see also a summary of the book at [http://www.gardenvisit.com/history_theory/library_online_ebooks/architecture_city_as_landscape]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epstein's ''trans-postmodernism''===
In his 1999 book on [[Russian postmodernism]] the Russian-American Slavist [[Mikhail Epstein]] suggested that postmodernism  “is […] part of a much larger historical formation,” which he calls “[[postmodernity]].”&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Mikhail; Genis, Alexander; Vladiv-Glover, Slobodanka. ''Russian Postmodernism. New Perspectives on Post-Soviet Culture''. Berghahn Books: New York, 1999, p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt; Epstein believes that postmodernist aesthetics will eventually become entirely conventional and provide the foundation for a new, non-ironic kind of poetry, which he describes using the prefix "[[:wikt:trans-|trans-]]":
{{quote|In considering the names that might possibly be used to designate the new era following "postmodernism," one finds that the prefix "trans" stands out in a special way. The last third of the 20th century developed under the sign of "post," which signalled the demise of such concepts of modernity as "truth" and "objectivity," "soul" and "subjectivity," "utopia" and "ideality," "primary origin" and "originality," "sincerity" and "sentimentality." All of these concepts are now being reborn in the form of "trans-subjectivity," "trans-idealism," "trans-utopianism," "trans-originality," "trans-lyricism," "trans-sentimentality" etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.focusing.org/apm_papers/epstein.html | title=Epstein (specific) - the Place of Postmodernism in Postmodernity}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As an example Epstein cites the work of the contemporary Russian poet [[Timur Kibirov]].&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Mikhail; Genis, Alexander; Vladiv-Glover, Slobodanka. ''Russian Postmodernism. New Perspectives on Post-Soviet Culture''. Berghahn Books: New York, 1999, pp. 457-460&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gans' ''post-millennialism''===
The term ''post-millennialism'' was introduced in 2000 by the American cultural theorist [[Eric Gans]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = The Post-Millennial Age | journal = Anthropoetics | volume = 209 | date = June 3, 2000 | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/vw209/ | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the era after postmodernism in ethical and socio-political terms. Gans associates postmodernism closely with "victimary thinking," which he defines as being based on a non-negotiable ethical opposition between perpetrators and victims arising out of the experience of [[Auschwitz]] and [[Hiroshima]]. In Gans's view, the ethics of postmodernism is derived from identifying with the peripheral victim and disdaining the utopian center occupied by the perpetrator. Postmodernism in this sense is marked by a victimary politics that is productive in its opposition to modernist utopianism and totalitarianism but unproductive in its resentment of capitalism and liberal democracy, which he sees as the long-term agents of global reconciliation. In contrast to postmodernism, post-millennialism is distinguished by the rejection of victimary thinking and a turn to "non-victimary dialogue"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = Victimary Thinking Forever? | journal = Anthropoetics | volume = 230 | date = March 31, 2001 | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/vw230.htm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; that will "diminish […] the amount of resentment in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = Moral Heroism | journal = Anthropoetics | volume = 237 | date = June 9, 2001 | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/vw237.htm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gans has developed the notion of post-millennialism further in many of his internet ''Chronicles of Love and Resentment''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = Chronicles of Love and Resentment | work = Anthropoetics | publisher = [[University of California, Los Angeles]] | date =  | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/Chronicles_home.cfm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}} }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term is allied closely with his theory of [[generative anthropology]] and his scenic concept of history.&lt;ref&gt;For more on both see Gans, Eric: ''Originary Thinking: Elements of Generative Anthropology''. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kirby's ''pseudo-modernism'' or ''digimodernism''===
In his 2006 paper [[The Death of Postmodernism and Beyond]], the British scholar [[Alan Kirby (writer)|Alan Kirby]] formulated a socio-cultural assessment of post-postmodernism that he calls “pseudo-modernism.”&lt;ref name="philosophynow"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kirby | first = Alan | authorlink = Alan Kirby (writer)| title = The Death of Postmodernism And Beyond | journal = Philosophy Now | volume = | issue = 58 | date = November–December 2006 | language =  | url = http://www.philosophynow.org/issue58/58kirby.htm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirby associates pseudo-modernism with the triteness and shallowness resulting from the instantaneous, direct, and superficial participation in culture made possible by the internet, mobile phones, interactive television and similar means: "In pseudo-modernism one phones, clicks, presses, surfs, chooses, moves, downloads."&lt;ref name="philosophynow" /&gt;

Pseudo-modernism's "typical intellectual states" are furthermore described as being "[[ignorance]], [[fanaticism]] and [[anxiety]]" and it is said to produce a "trance-like state" in those participating in it. The net result of this media-induced shallowness and instantaneous participation in trivial events is a "silent autism" superseding "the neurosis of modernism and the narcissism of postmodernism." Kirby sees no aesthetically valuable works coming out of "pseudo-modernism." As examples of its triteness he cites reality TV, interactive news programs, "the drivel found […] on some [[wikipedia|Wikipedia pages]]", docu-soaps, and the essayistic cinema of [[Michael Moore]] or [[Morgan Spurlock]].&lt;ref name="philosophynow"/&gt; In a book published in September 2009 titled ''Digimodernism: How New Technologies Dismantle the Postmodern and Reconfigure our Culture'', Kirby developed further and nuanced his views on culture and textuality in the aftermath of [[postmodernism]].

===Vermeulen and van den Akker's ''metamodernism''===
In 2010 the cultural theorists Timotheus Vermeulen and Robin van den Akker introduced the term [[metamodernism]] &lt;ref name="journalofaestheticsandculture"&gt;Vermeulen, Timotheus and Robin van den Akker. "[http://aestheticsandculture.net/index.php/jac/article/view/5677/6304 Notes on metamodernism]", ''Journal of Aesthetics and Culture" 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; as an intervention in the post-postmodernism debate. In their article 'Notes on metamodernism' they assert that the 2000s are characterized by the emergence of a sensibility that oscillates between, and must be situated beyond, modern positions and postmodern strategies. As examples of the metamodern sensibility Vermeulen and van den Akker cite the 'informed naivety', 'pragmatic idealism' and 'moderate fanaticism' of the various cultural responses to, among others, climate change, the financial crisis, and (geo)political instability.

The prefix 'meta' here refers not to some reflective stance or repeated rumination, but to Plato's ''[[metaxy]]'', which intends a movement between opposite poles as well as beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metamodernism.com/2010/10/14/what-meta-means-and-does-not-mean/ | title=What meta means and does not mean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Post-socialist art''' (or post-communist art) is a term used in analysis of art arriving from post-socialist (post-communist) countries taken as different in their nature from Western, [[Postmodern art]].

Crucial for such art is that:
# Because of having no market of art such art was Modernist in a sense of being non-commercial (Groys, 2004), but also;
# Having no market of art authorship was weakened authorship allowed working under pseudonyms, anonymously or even collectively (Peraica, 2006); and finally;
# Such art was necessary referring to the inner history of art, as commonly to Russian Avantgard [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[El Lissitzky]]

Socialist art started opening to Western markets already in the eighties, introducing Slovenian collective [[IRWIN]], Belgrade Malevich (aka Goran Djordjevic) and other artists [[Peter Weibel]] named Retro-avantgard. In the second wave of nineties it was followed by a weakened political versions which were massively funded (Most of such art was financed by [[George Soros]], similarly to [[Socialist realism]] which Lead thinkers as Miško Šuvaković to name such art [[Soros Realism]].

{{main|Conservation-restoration}}
[[File:Art Restoration, Painting and Frame Restoration, before and after, Oliver Brothers Art Restoration, Boston.jpg|thumb|upright|Example of painting and frame restoration – before and after]]

'''Restoration''' is a process that attempts to return [[cultural heritage]] to some previous state that the restorer imagines was the "original". This was commonly done in the past. However, in the late 20th century a separate concept of [[conservation-restoration]] was developed that is more concerned with preserving the work of art for the future, and less with making it look pristine. Restoration is controversial, since it often involves some irreversible change to the original material of the artwork with the goal of making it "look good." The attitude that has developed in recent years with the development of conservation is to attempt to make all restoration reversible.

[[File:Carroll Wales, Art Restorer, Oliver Brothers Art Restoration- Boston.jpg|thumbnail|Restoration of [[Kariye Camii]], Istanbul, 1957]]
Art conservation can involve the cleaning and stabilization of art work. Ideally, any process used is reversible, departures from that ideal not being undertaken lightly. Cleaning is not a reversible process and can sometimes be controversial due to fears that cleaning would damage a piece, or on the grounds that damage or residue forms part of the history of a given piece and should not be modified. [[Michelangelo]]'s [[David (Michelangelo)|statue of David]] has undergone two cleanings to remove dirt that had accumulated on the statue's surface.

Art restoration is vital to the survival of classical paintings and is part of the scientific application of chemistry.  It often involves research to determine the original colors and materials of a work.

===Watercolor on fresco===
The use of watercolor paints to inpaint damages on fresco is an example of a technique utilized to achieve almost complete reversibility. This is the technique used in the 20 year [[Conservation-restoration of Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper|restoration of Da Vinci's ''The Last Supper'']] in Milan. One of the most popular inpainting techniques used today is the Tinted Varnish Treatment. This process is done once the piece is fully cleaned and varnished. This last step in the restoration process is to then go into spots where original paint may be missing, or where patched holes and other irregularities may lie. The restorer then goes in with tinted varnish over the top of the non-tinted varnish. This gives the illusion that the spots have been "re-painted", while in fact it is just a spot of tinted varnish. Most commonly "stippling" is used while using tinted varnish, in order for light to reflect similar to paint. This is done by using tiny dots in a row for variance.

===Painting with light===

In 2014, Harvard Art Museums exhibited murals by [[Mark Rothko]] from 1961 and 1962 which had faded due to their original display in a dining room.  It restored the works to their original appearance by digitally projecting light carefully calibrated at each pixel from a photograph of the original colors, which made up the difference between the current and original appearance without damaging the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2014-06-03|accessdate=2015-06-07|url=http://www.gizmag.com/rothko-harvard-murals/32374/|title=Harvard uses projection technology to shine new light on faded Rothko murals}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.harvardartmuseums.org/about/press/mark-rothko%E2%80%99s-harvard-murals-feature-harvard-art-museums%E2%80%99-inaugural-special-exhibition&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Bentley''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɛ|n|t|l|i}}; 27 January 1662 – 14 July 1742) was an English [[Classics|classical scholar]], critic, and theologian. He was Master of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].

Bentley was the first Englishman to be ranked with the great heroes of [[Classical antiquity|classical]] learning and was known for his literary and textual criticism. Called the "founder of historical [[philology]]", Bentley is credited with the creation of the English school of [[Hellenism (Academia)|Hellenism]], and introduced the first competitive written examinations in a Western university.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Richard Bentley blue plaque Bentley Square Oulton.jpg|thumb|right|Plaque on Bentley Square, Oulton]]
Bentley was born at [[Oulton, West Yorkshire|Oulton]] near [[Rothwell, West Yorkshire|Rothwell]], [[Leeds]], West Yorkshire, in northern England.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}} A blue plaque near his birthplace commemorates the fact. His father was Thomas Bentley of Oulton. His grandfather, Captain James Bentley,{{citation needed|date=August 2017|reason=for both his father and Grandfather's names}} had suffered for the [[Charles I of England|Royalist]] cause following the [[English Civil War]], leaving the family in reduced circumstances. Bentley's mother, the daughter of a [[stonemason]], had some education, and was able to give her son his first lessons in [[Latin language|Latin]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}

After attending [[grammar school]] in [[Wakefield]], Bentley was an undergraduate at [[St John's College, Cambridge]], in 1676.{{efn|His portrait hangs in the formal dining hall of the College.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}}} He afterwards obtained a scholarship and took the degree of B.A. in 1680 (M.A. 1683).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}{{sfn|ACAD|BNTY676R}}

==Academic work==
He never became a [[Fellow]], but was appointed to be the headmaster of [[Spalding Grammar School]] before he was 21. [[Edward Stillingfleet]], dean of St Paul's, hired Bentley as tutor to his son, which enabled the younger man to meet eminent scholars, have access to the best private library in England, and become familiar with Dean Stillingfleet. During his six years as tutor, Bentley also made a comprehensive study of [[Greek language|Greek]] and Latin writers, storing up knowledge which he used later.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}

In 1689, Stillingfleet became [[bishop of Worcester]], and Bentley's pupil went to [[Wadham College, Oxford]], accompanied by his tutor. Bentley soon met [[John Mill (theologian)|Dr John Mill]], [[Humphrey Hody]], and [[Edward Bernard]]. Here he studied the manuscripts of the [[Bodleian Library|Bodleian]], [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi]] and other college libraries. He collected material for literary studies. Among these are a corpus of the fragments of the Greek poets and an edition of the Greek [[lexicographer]]s.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}

The Oxford (Sheldonian) press was about to bring out an edition (the ''[[editio princeps]]'') from the unique manuscript of the ''[[Greek Chronicle]]'' in the [[Bodleian Library]]. It was a [[universal history]] (down to AD 560) of John of Antioch (date uncertain, between 600 and 1000), called [[John Malalas]] or "John the Rhetor". The editor, Dr John Mill, principal of [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford|St Edmund Hall]], asked Bentley to review it and make any remarks on the text.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}

Bentley wrote the ''Epistola ad Johannem Millium'', which is about 100 pages included at the end of the ''Oxford Malalas'' (1691). This short treatise placed Bentley ahead of all living English scholars. The ease with which he restored corrupted passages, the certainty of his [[:wikt:emendation|emendation]] and command over the relevant material, are in a style totally different from the careful and laborious learning of [[Humphrey Hody|Hody]], Mill or [[Edmund Chilmead]]. To the small circle of classical students (lacking the great critical dictionaries of modern times), it was obvious that he was a critic beyond the ordinary.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}

[[Image:Bust of Richard Bently by Louis-François Roubiliac.jpg|thumb|upright|A bust of Bentley now stands in the library of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]]]
In 1690, Bentley had taken [[deacon]]'s orders. In 1692 he was nominated first [[Boyle Lectures|Boyle lecturer]], a nomination repeated in 1694. He was offered the appointment a third time in 1695 but declined it, as he was involved in too many other activities. In the first series of lectures ("A Confutation of Atheism"), he endeavours to present [[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] [[physics]] in a popular form, and to frame them (especially in opposition to [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]]) into proof of the existence of an intelligent Creator. He had some correspondence with Newton, then living in [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], on the subject. The second series, preached in 1694, has not been published and is believed to be lost.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}

After being [[ordain]]ed, Bentley was promoted to a [[prebendal stall]] in [[Worcester Cathedral]]. In 1693 the curator of the royal library became vacant, and his friends tried to obtain the position for Bentley, but did not have enough influence. The new librarian, a Mr Thynne, resigned in favour of Bentley, on condition that he receive an annuity of £130 for life out of the £200 salary. In 1695 Bentley received a royal [[chaplaincy]] and the [[Benefice|living]] of [[Hartlebury]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}

That same year, he was elected a fellow of the [[Royal Society]], and in 1696 earned the degree of D.D. (Doctor of Divinity). The scholar [[Johann Georg Graevius]] of [[Utrecht]] made a dedication to him, prefixed to a dissertation on [[Albert Rubens (1614-1657)|Albert Rubens]], ''De Vita Fl. Mallii Theodori'' (1694).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}

===Dissertation on the ''Epistles'' of Phalaris===
Bentley had official apartments in [[St. James's Palace]], and his first care was the royal library. He worked to restore the collection from a dilapidated condition. He persuaded the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Earl of Marlborough]] to ask for additional rooms in the palace for the books. This was granted, but Marlborough kept them for personal use. Bentley enforced the law, ensuring that publishers delivered nearly 1000 volumes which had been purchased but not delivered.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

The [[University of Cambridge]] commissioned him to obtain Greek and Latin fonts for their classical books; he had these made in Holland. He assisted [[John Evelyn]] in his ''Numismata''. Bentley did not settle down to the steady execution of any of the major projects he had started. In 1694, he designed an edition of [[Philostratus]], but abandoned it to Gottfried Olearius (1672–1715), "to the joy," says [[Friedrich August Wolf|F. A. Wolf]], "of Olearius and of no one else." He supplied [[Graevius]] with collations of [[Cicero]], and [[Joshua Barnes]] with a warning as to the spuriousness of the ''Epistles'' of [[Euripides]]. Barnes printed the epistles anyway and declared that no one could doubt their authenticity but a man ''perfrictae frontis aut judicii imminuti''. For Graevius's ''Callimachus'' (1697), Bentley added a collection of the fragments with notes.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

He wrote the ''Dissertation on the Epistles of Phalaris'' (1699), his major academic work, almost accidentally. In 1697, [[William Wotton]], about to bring out a second edition of his ''Ancient and Modern Learning'', asked Bentley to write out a paper exposing the spuriousness of the ''Epistles'' of [[Phalaris]], long a subject of academic controversy.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}} The [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] editor of Phalaris, [[Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery|Charles Boyle]], resented Bentley's paper. He had already quarrelled with Bentley in trying to get the manuscript in the royal library collated for his edition (1695). Boyle wrote a response which was accepted by the reading public, although it was much later criticised as showing superficial learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=751}} cites Dr [[Alexander Dyce]], ''Bentley's Works, 1836–1838''&lt;/ref&gt; The demand for Boyle's book required a second printing. When Bentley responded, it was with his dissertation. The truth of its conclusions was not immediately recognised, but it has a high reputation.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

===Master of Trinity College===
In 1700, the commissioners of ecclesiastical [[patronage]] recommended Bentley to the Crown for the mastership of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. He arrived an outsider and proceeded to reform the college administration.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}} He started a programme of renovations to the buildings, and used his position to promote learning. He is also credited by the British mathematician [[Rouse Ball]]{{sfn|Ball|1835|p=193}}  with starting the first written examinations in the West in 1702, all those prior to this being oral in nature.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} At the same time, he antagonised the fellows, and the capital programme caused reductions in their incomes, which they resented.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

After ten years of stubborn but ineffectual resistance, the fellows appealed to the Visitor, the [[bishop of Ely]] ([[John Moore (Bishop of Ely)|John Moore]]). Their petition was full of general complaints. Bentley's reply (''The Present State of Trinity College'', etc., 1710) is in his most crushing style. The fellows amended their petition and added a charge of Bentley's having committed 54 breaches of the statutes. Bentley appealed directly to the Crown, and backed his application with a dedication of his ''[[Horace]]'' to the lord treasurer (Harley).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

The Crown lawyers decided against him; the case was heard (1714) and a sentence of expulsion from the mastership was drawn up. Before it was executed, the bishop of Ely died and the process lapsed. The feud continued in various forms at lower levels. In 1718 Cambridge rescinded Bentley's degrees, as punishment for failing to appear in the vice-chancellor's court in a civil suit. It was not until 1724 that he had them restored under the law.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

In 1733 the fellows of Trinity again brought Bentley to trial before the bishop of Ely (then [[Thomas Green (bishop)|Thomas Greene]]), and he was sentenced to deprivation. The college statutes required the sentence to be exercised by the vice-master [[Richard Walker (philosopher)|Richard Walker]], who was a friend of Bentley and refused to act. Although the feud continued until 1738 or 1740 (about thirty years in all), Bentley remained in his post.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

===Later studies===
During his mastership, except for the first two years, Bentley continuously pursued his studies, although he did not publish much. In 1709 he contributed a critical appendix to [[John Davies (1679–1732)|John Davies]]'s edition of [[Cicero]]'s ''Tusculan Disputations''. In the following year, he published his emendations on the ''Plutus'' and ''Nubes'' of [[Aristophanes]], and on the fragments of [[Menander]] and [[Philemon (poet)|Philemon]]. He published the last work under the pen name of "Phileleutherus Lipsiensis."  He used it again two years later in his ''Remarks on a late Discourse of Freethinking'', a reply to [[Anthony Collins]] the [[deism|deist]]. The university thanked him for this work and its support of the Anglican Church and clergy.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

Although he had long studied Horace, Bentley wrote his version quickly in the end, publishing it in 1711 to gain public support at a critical period of the Trinity quarrel. In the preface, he declared his intention of confining his attention to criticism and correction of the text. Some of his 700 or 800 [[:wikt:emendations|emendations]] have been accepted, but the majority were rejected by the early 20th century as unnecessary, although scholars acknowledged they showed his wide learning.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

In 1716, in a letter to [[William Wake]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], Bentley announced his plan to prepare a critical edition of the [[New Testament]]. During the next four years, assisted by [[J. J. Wetstein]], an eminent biblical critic, he collected materials for the work. In 1720 he published ''Proposals for a New Edition of the Greek Testament'', with examples of how he intended to proceed. By comparing the text of the [[Vulgate]] with that of the oldest Greek manuscripts, Bentley proposed to restore the Greek text as received by the church at the time of the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]].&lt;!--EB1911 p. 752; states Nice not Nicaea--&gt;{{sfn|Dyce|1966|p=487}} Bentley's lead manuscript was ''[[Codex Alexandrinus]]'', which he described as "the oldest and best in the world".{{sfn|Jebb|1882|p=163}} Bentley used also manuscripts: [[Minuscule 51|51]], [[Minuscule 54|54]], [[Minuscule 60|60]], [[Minuscule 113|113]], [[Minuscule 440|440]], [[Minuscule 507|507]], and [[Minuscule 508|508]].{{sfn|Scrivener|1894|p=198}} [[John Walker (scholar)|John Walker]] worked over many manuscripts for the project, particularly in Paris with the help of the [[Congregation of Saint Maur|Maur]]ists.{{sfn|Wordsworth|1901|p=}} Numerous subscribers were obtained to support publication of the work, but he never completed it.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

His ''[[Terence]]'' (1726) is more important than his ''Horace''; next to the ''Phalaris'', this most determined his reputation. In 1726 he also published the ''Fables'' of [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus]] and the ''Sententiae'' of [[Publilius Syrus]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}

His ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1732), suggested by [[Caroline of Ansbach|Queen Caroline]], has been criticised as the weakest of his work. He suggested that the poet [[John Milton]] had employed both an [[amanuensis]] and an editor, who were responsible for clerical errors and interpolations, but it is unclear whether Bentley believed his own position.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} [[A. E. Housman]], who called him "the greatest scholar that England or perhaps that Europe ever bred" nevertheless criticised his poetic sensibility severely: "...we are not all so easily found out as Bentley, because we have not Bentley's intrepid candour. There is a sort of savage nobility about his firm reliance on his own bad taste...".{{sfn|Housman|1989|p=268}}

Bentley never published his planned edition of [[Homer]], but some of his manuscript and marginal notes are held by Trinity College. Their chief importance is in his attempt to restore the metre by the insertion of the lost ''[[digamma]]''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}

==Relationships and personal life==
According to the anonymous author of his biography in the [[Encyclopaedia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] Bentley was self-assertive and presumptuous, which alienated some people. But, [[James Henry Monk]], Bentley's biographer, charged him (in his first edition, 1830) with an indecorum of which he was not guilty. Bentley seemed to inspire mixed feelings of admiration and repugnance.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}

==Marriage and family==
In 1701, Bentley married Joanna (died 1740), daughter of [[Sir John Bernard, 2nd Baronet]] of Brampton, [[Huntingdonshire]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}{{sfn|Collins|1741|p=364}}  They had three children together:
*[[Richard Bentley (writer)|Richard]] (1708–1782), an eccentric, playwright and artist,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}{{sfn|''SoPSE''}}{{sfn|Radcliffe|2011}}, and two daughters, one named Johanna.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} {{efn|A portrait, by [[William Wissing]] of his wife Joanna, is in the collection of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] {{harv|ArtUK}}.}}

His daughter{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} Johanna Bentley{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} married [[Denison Cumberland]] in 1728, a grandson of [[Richard Cumberland (bishop)|Richard Cumberland]] the [[bishop of Peterborough]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} and himself later a bishop of the [[Church of Ireland]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}Their son [[Richard Cumberland (dramatist)|Richard Cumberland]] developed as a prolific dramatist,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} while earning his living as a civil servant.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Later life==
In old age, Bentley continued to read; and enjoyed the society of his friends and several rising scholars, J Markland, John Taylor, and his nephews Richard and Thomas Bentley, with whom he discussed classical subjects. He died on the 14 July 1742 of [[pleurisy]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}

==Legacy and honours==
*Bentley left about £5,000 in his estate (which would have the buying power of nearly £500,000 in 2010{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}
*He bequeathed a few Greek manuscripts, brought from [[Mount Athos]], to the Trinity College library.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}
*He bequeathed his books and papers to his nephew Richard Bentley, a fellow of Trinity. At his own death in 1786, the younger Bentley left the papers to the Trinity College library.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}
*The [[British Museum]] eventually purchased the books, which in many cases had valuable manuscript notes, and holds them in its collection.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}

According to the anonymous author of his biography in the Encyclopaedia Britannica Eleventh Edition Bentley was the first Englishman to be ranked with the great heroes of classical learning. Before him there were only [[John Selden]], and, in a more restricted field, [[Thomas Gataker]] and [[John Pearson (bishop)|John Pearson]].
{{quote|Bentley inaugurated a new era of the art of criticism. He opened a new path. With him criticism attained its majority. Where scholars had hitherto offered suggestions and conjectures, Bentley, with unlimited control over the whole material of learning, gave decisions|Jacob Mähly (1828–1902).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} cites {{harv| Mähly|1868}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The modern German school of [[philology]] recognised his genius. Bunsen wrote that Bentley "was the founder of historical philology." [[Jakob Bernays]] says of his corrections of the ''Tristia'', "corruptions which had hitherto defied every attempt even of the mightiest, were removed by a touch of the fingers of this British [[Samson]]".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}

Bentley was credited with creating the English school of Hellenists, by which the 18th century was distinguished, including scholars such as [[Richard Dawes|R Dawes]], [[Jeremiah Markland|J Markland]], [[John Taylor (1704–1766)|John Taylor]], [[Jonathan Toup]], [[Thomas Tyrwhitt|T Tyrwhitt]], [[Richard Porson]], [[Peter Paul Dobree]], [[Thomas Kidd (classical scholar)|Thomas Kidd]] and [[James Henry Monk]]. Although the Dutch school of the period had its own tradition, it was also influenced by Bentley. His letters to [[Tiberius Hemsterhuis]] on his edition of [[Julius Pollux]] made the latter one of Bentley's most devoted admirers.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}

Bentley inspired a following generation of scholars. Self-taught, he created his own discipline; but no contemporary English guild of learning could measure his power or check his eccentricities. He defeated his academic adversaries in the Phalaris controversy. The attacks by [[Alexander Pope]] (he was assigned a niche in ''The Dunciad''),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} cite  Pope ''Dunciad'', b. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Arbuthnot]] and others demonstrated their inability to appreciate his work, as they considered textual criticism as pedantry.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} His classical controversies also called forth [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Battle of the Books]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In a university where the instruction of youth or the religious controversy of the day was the chief occupation, Bentley was unique. His learning and original views seem to have been developed before 1700. After this period, he acquired little and made only spasmodic efforts to publish.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} However A.E.Housman believed that the edition of [[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]] (1739) was Bentley's greatest work.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

'''Ronald Brunlees McKerrow''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (12 December 1872 – 20 January 1940) was one of the leading bibliographers and Shakespeare scholars of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;David McKitterick, 'Introduction', in: ''An Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students'' (1927, reprint 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
R. B. McKerrow was born in [[Putney]], son of [[Alexander McKerrow]], a civil engineer, and Mary Jane Brunlees, daughter of [[James Brunlees|Sir James Brunlees]], a president of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]].&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt; His paternal grandfather was [[William McKerrow]], a noted cleric in the [[Presbyterian Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science: Volume 17 - Malawi: Libraries in to Metropolitan Reference and Research Library Agency (METRO) |first1=Allen |last1=Kent |first2=Harold |last2=Lancour |first3=Jay E. |last3=Daily |page=321 |publisher=CRC Press |year=1976 |isbn=978-0-82472-017-9 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PSpemHkShCQC&amp;pg=PA321}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in [[Picket Piece]] ([[Wendover]], Buckinghamshire) where he was buried.&lt;ref name="odnb"&gt;W. W. Greg, 'McKerrow, Ronald Brunlees (1872–1940)', rev. John V. Richardson Jr., ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct 2006 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/34758, accessed 14 Sept 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was educated at [[Harrow School|Harrow]], at [[King's College, London]], and at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=MKRW894RB|name=Mckerrow, Ronald Brunlees}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then taught English for three years in Tokyo (1897&amp;ndash;1900), where he learnt Japanese. 
Following his return to London, he became a director of the publishing house [[Sidgwick and Jackson]] (1908).&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;G.B. Harrison, ''Review of English Studies'', xvi, no. 63, July 1940, pp. 257&amp;ndash;61.&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded a D.Litt. by the University of Cambridge in 1911. In 1912 he became joint Honorary Secretary of the [[Bibliographical Society]] (with [[A. W. Pollard]]).  The Society became the focus for much of his intellectual activity.

During the First World War he taught in the English Department at [[King's College, London]] (until 1919).
He founded the [[The Review of English Studies|''Review of English Studies'']] in 1925 and remained its editor until his death.
He also edited the Bibliographical Society's journal ''The Library'' from 1934 to 1937.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;

McKerrow received an honorary doctorate from [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Louvain University]] in 1927 and was the Sandars Reader in Bibliography at Cambridge University in 1928. The following year he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Bibliographical Society. In 1932 he became a fellow of the [[British Academy]].&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;

His papers are preserved in the Library of [[Trinity College (Cambridge)|Trinity College]], Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=EAD%2FGBR%2F0016%2FRBMK Cambridge University Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
{{Wikisource author}}
McKerrow's work had three main focuses: 
* the textual study of early English Drama, especially the works of [[Thomas Nash]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]; he was one of the founder members of the [[Malone Society]].
* the history of the English book trade in the early-modern period; he made three substantial contributions in this field: ''Printers' and Publishers' Devices in England and Scotland, 1485&amp;ndash;1640'' (1913), ''Title-Page Borders used in England and Scotland, 1485&amp;ndash;1640'' (with [[Frederic Sutherland Ferguson|F. S. Ferguson]]) (1932), and under his general editorship the volume for 1557&amp;ndash;1640 in the Bibliographical Society's  ''Dictionaries of the printers and booksellers who were at work in England, Scotland and Ireland, 1557&amp;ndash;1775'' (1910).[http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001757519]
* the theory and practice of historical and textual bibliography: firstly, his major edition of the works of Thomas Nash (1904); his ''An Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students'' (1927) which remains a standard work (supplemented now by [[Philip Gaskell]]'s ''New Introduction to Bibliography'', 1972); and the ''Prolegomena for the Oxford Shakespeare'' (1939) which was intended to be the introduction for a full scientific critical edition of Shakespeare which was unfinished at his death.

With [[A. W. Pollard]] and [[Walter Wilson Greg|W. W. Greg]], R. B. McKerrow was one of the three great figures of English bibliography of the first half of the twentieth century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53725">'''Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics''' ('''STEM'''), previously [[Science]], [[Math]], [[Engineering]] and [[Technology]] ('''SMET'''), is a term used to group together these [[academic disciplines]].&lt;ref name="fas.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42642.pdf|format=PDF|title=Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Education: A Primer|website=Fas.org|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term is typically used when addressing education policy and [[curriculum]] choices in schools to improve competitiveness in science and technology development. It has implications for workforce development, national security concerns and immigration policy.&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt;

The [[acronym]] came into common use shortly after an interagency meeting on science education held at the US [[National Science Foundation]]{{when?|date=May 2018}} chaired by the then NSF director [[Rita Colwell]].&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{Cite web|url= http://www.naplesnews.com/opinion/perspectives/guest-commentary-a-stem-in-collier-county-to-reach-their-future-2392f62e-9c19-2198-e053-0100007f6ee5-341858231.html|title= Guest commentary: A "STEM" in Collier County to reach their future|website= Naplesnews.com|access-date= 2016-06-09 | quote = The acronym STEM was suggested by Rita Colwell, Ph.D., a bacteriologist who was director of NSF in the 1980s.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
A director from the Office of Science division of Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists, Peter Faletra, suggested the change from the older acronym SMET to STEM. Colwell, expressing some dislike for the older acronym, responded by suggesting NSF institute the change. However, the acronym STEM predates NSF and likely traces its origin to Charles Vela, the founder and director of the Center for the Advancement of Hispanics in Science and Engineering Education (CAHSEE)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cahsee.org/about/about.asp.htm|title=CAHSEE - About CAHSEE|website=www.cahsee.org|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stem.ccny.cuny.edu/|title=STEM Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics - Main|website=stem.ccny.cuny.edu|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kqnRETS9FWwC|title=Hispanic Engineer &amp; IT|last=Group|first=Career Communications|date=1996|publisher=Career Communications Group|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In the early 1990's CAHSEE started a summer program for talented under-represented students in the Washington, DC area called the STEM Institute.  Based on the program's recognized success and his expertise in STEM education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=100381&amp;org=HRD&amp;from=news|title=President Bush Honors Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring {{!}} NSF - National Science Foundation|website=www.nsf.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Charles Vela was asked to serve on numerous NSF and Congressional panels in science, mathematics and engineering education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cahsee.org/about/founder.asp.htm|title=CAHSEE - Founder's Biography|website=www.cahsee.org|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;; it is through this manner that NSF was first introduced to the acronym STEM.  One of the first NSF projects to use the acronym{{cn|date=May 2018}} was STEMTEC, the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Teacher Education Collaborative at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], which was founded in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;

In the United States, the acronym began to be used in education and immigration debates in initiatives to begin to address the perceived lack of qualified candidates for high-tech jobs. It also addresses concern that the subjects are often taught in isolation, instead of as an integrated curriculum.&lt;ref name="STEM PA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iu1stemcenter.org/files/CMU_and_IU_STEM_Survey.pdf |title=STEM Education in Southwestern Pennsylvania |year=2008 |publisher=The Intermediate Unit 1 Center for STEM Education |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining a citizenry that is well versed in the STEM fields is a key portion of the [[public education]] agenda of the United States.&lt;ref name="USNEWS2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/stem-education/2012/07/26/us-news-inducts-five-to-stem-leadership-hall-of-fame |title=U.S. News Inducts Five to STEM Leadership Hall of Fame |date=July 26, 2012 |author=Morella, Michael |publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The acronym has been widely used in the immigration debate regarding access to United States [[work visa]]s for [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]] who are skilled in these fields. It has also become commonplace in education discussions as a reference to the shortage of skilled workers and inadequate education in these areas.&lt;ref name="Bill Clinton Lays Out"&gt;{{cite news

====National Science Foundation====
Many organizations in the United States follow the guidelines of the [[National Science Foundation]] on what constitutes a STEM field. The NSF uses a broader definition of STEM subjects that includes subjects in the fields of [[chemistry]], [[Computer science|computer]] and [[information technology]] science, engineering, geosciences, life sciences, mathematical sciences, physics and astronomy, [[social sciences]] ([[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[psychology]] and [[sociology]]), and STEM education and learning research.&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nsf.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2012/nsf12599/nsf12599.htm#appendix|title=Graduate Research Fellowship Program|work=nsf.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eligibility for scholarship programs such as the CSM STEM Scholars Program use the NSF definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmd.edu/istem/scholarship_stem.html |title=ISTEM – College of Southern Maryland }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NSF is the only American federal agency whose mission includes support for all fields of fundamental science and engineering, except for medical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/about/what.jsp |title=What We Do |publisher=The National Science Foundation |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its disciplinary program areas include scholarships, grants, fellowships in fields such as biological sciences, computer and [[information science]] and  engineering, education and human resources, engineering, environmental research and education, geosciences, international science and engineering, mathematical and physical sciences, social, behavioral and economic sciences, cyberinfrastructure, and polar programs.&lt;ref name="nsf.gov"/&gt;

====Immigration policy====
Although many organizations in the United States follow the guidelines of the [[National Science Foundation]] on what constitutes a STEM field, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) has its own functional definition used for immigration policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42530.pdf|format=PDF|title=Immigration of Foreign Nationals with Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Degrees|website=Fas.org|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, DHS or ICE announced an expanded list of STEM designated-degree programs that qualify eligible graduates on student visas for an optional practical training (OPT) extension. Under the OPT program, international students who graduate from colleges and universities in the United States are able to remain in the country and receive training through work experience for up to 12 months. Students who graduate from a designated STEM degree program can remain for an additional 17 months on an OPT STEM extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DHS Expands List of STEM designated-degree programs|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/dhs-expands-list-stem-designated-degree-programs |publisher=Fowler White Boggs P.A. |author=Jennifer G.

The [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] lists disciplines including&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ice.gov/sevis/stemlist.htm |title=STEM Designated Degree Programs |date=April 2008 |publisher=U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[physics]], [[actuarial science]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[mathematics]], [[applied mathematics]], [[statistics]], [[computer science]], [[computational science]], [[psychology]], [[biochemistry]], [[robotics]], [[computer engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[electronics]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[industrial engineering]], [[information science]], [[information technology]], [[civil engineering]], [[aerospace engineering]], [[chemical engineering]], [[astrophysics]], [[astronomy]], [[optics]], [[nanotechnology]], [[nuclear physics]], [[mathematical biology]], [[operations research]], [[neurobiology]], [[biomechanics]], [[bioinformatics]], [[acoustical engineering]], [[geographic information system]]s, [[atmospheric sciences]], [[Educational technology|educational/instructional technology]], [[software engineering]], and [[educational research]].

====Education====
By cultivating an interest in the natural and social sciences in preschool or immediately following school entry, the chances of STEM success in high school can be greatly improved. [[School segregation|School integration]] can  help black, Hispanic and aboriginal students catch up with Asian and white students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

STEM supports broadening the study of [[engineering]] within each of the other subjects, and beginning engineering at younger grades, even elementary school. It also brings STEM education to all students rather than only the gifted programs. In his 2012 budget, President Barack Obama renamed and broadened the "''Mathematics and Science Partnership (MSP)''" to award block grants to states for improving teacher education in those subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/02/obamas-budget-shuffles-stem.html |title=Obama's Budget Shuffles STEM Education Deck |date=14 February 2012 |author=Jane J.

In the 2015 run of the international assessment test the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), American students came out 35th in mathematics, 24th in reading and 25th in science, out of 109 countries. The United States also ranked 29th in the percentage of 24-year-olds with science or mathematics degrees&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pisa/|title=Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) - Overview|website=nces.ed.gov|language=EN|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

STEM education often uses new technologies such as [[RepRap]] [[3D printers]] to encourage interest in STEM fields.&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Irwin, D.E. Oppliger, J.M. Pearce, G. Anzalone, [http://www.asee.org/file_server/papers/attachment/file/0005/4988/asee_K-12_2015_finalpaper.pdf Evaluation of RepRap 3D Printer Workshops in K-12 STEM]. ''122nd ASEE 122nd ASEE Conf.

In 2006 the [[United States National Academies]] expressed their concern about the declining state of STEM education in the United States. Its Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy developed a list of 10 actions. Their top three recommendations were to:
* Increase America's talent pool by improving K–12 science and mathematics education
* Strengthen the skills of teachers through additional training in science, mathematics and technology
* Enlarge the pipeline of students prepared to enter college and graduate with STEM degrees&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slsd.org/webpages/rcolelli/resources.cfm?subpage=493006|title=STEM Education|website=Slsd.org|access-date=2016-06-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126095634/http://www.slsd.org/webpages/rcolelli/resources.cfm?subpage=493006|archivedate=2017-01-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] also has implemented programs and curricula to advance STEM education in order to replenish the pool of scientists, engineers and mathematicians who will lead space exploration in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Individual states, such as [[California]], have run pilot after-school STEM programs to learn what the most promising practices are and how to implement them to increase the chance of student success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://powerofdiscovery.org/sites/default/files/cde_report_task_10_and_11.pdf|format=PDF|title=Final Report : California Department of Education : CDE Agreement|website=Powerofdiscovery.org|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another state to invest in STEM education is Florida, where [https://floridapolytechnic.org/ Florida Polytechnic University], Florida’s first public university for engineering and technology dedicated to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = About Florida Polytechnic University|url = https://floridapolytechnic.org/about/|website = Florida Polytechnic University|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During school, STEM programs have been established for many districts throughout the U.S.  Some states include [[New Jersey]], [[Arizona]], [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], [[Texas]], and [[Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.olentangy.k12.oh.us/domain/1012|title=STEM Academy / Overview|website=www.olentangy.k12.oh.us|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/national-rankings/stem|title=Best STEM High schools|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing STEM education has expanded to the post-secondary level through masters programs such as the University of Maryland's STEM Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.education.umd.edu/MathEd/Outreach/DDP_MCPSSTEM%20.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910215842/http://www.education.umd.edu/MathEd/Outreach/DDP_MCPSSTEM%20.html |archivedate=2014-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the University of Cincinnati.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mastersed.uc.edu/masters-degree-in-education-online-programs/stem-science-technology-engineering-mathematics-teacher-degree/stem-degree-that-inspires-innovation/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910200320/http://mastersed.uc.edu/masters-degree-in-education-online-programs/stem-science-technology-engineering-mathematics-teacher-degree/stem-degree-that-inspires-innovation/ |archivedate=2014-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Racial gap in STEM fields====
In the United States, the National Science Foundation found that the average science score on the 2011 National Assessment of Educational Progress was lower for black and Hispanic students than white, Asian, and Pacific Islanders.&lt;ref&gt;"Science and Engineering Indicators 2014." S&amp;E Indicators 2014 - Figures - US National Science Foundation (NSF). N.p., n.d. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, eleven percent of the U.S. workforce was black, while only six percent of STEM workers were black.&lt;ref&gt;Landivar, Liana C. Disparities in STEM Employment by Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin . Rep. N.p.: n.p., 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Though STEM in the U.S. has typically been dominated by white males, there have been considerable efforts to create initiatives to make STEM a more racially and gender diverse field.&lt;ref&gt;"FACT SHEET: President Obama Announces Over $240 Million in New STEM Commitments at the 2015 White House Science Fair." National Archives and Records Administration. National Archives and Records Administration, n.d. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some evidence suggests that all students, including black and Hispanic students, have a better chance of earning a STEM degree if they attend a college or university at which their entering academic credentials are at least as high as the average student's.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Heriot, [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3112683 Want to Be a Doctor?

====American Competitiveness Initiative====
In the [[State of the Union Address]] on January 31, 2006, President [[George W. Bush]] announced the [[American Competitiveness Initiative]]. Bush proposed the initiative to address shortfalls in federal government support of educational development and progress at all academic levels in the STEM fields. In detail, the initiative called for significant increases in federal funding for advanced [[R&amp;D]] programs (including a doubling of federal funding support for advanced research in the physical sciences through [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]]) and an increase in U.S. higher education graduates within STEM disciplines.

The ''NASA Means Business'' competition, sponsored by the Texas Space Grant Consortium, furthers that goal. College students compete to develop promotional plans to encourage students in middle and high school to study STEM subjects and to inspire professors in STEM fields to involve their students in outreach activities that support STEM education.

The [[National Science Foundation]] has numerous programs in STEM education, including some for K–12 students such as the ITEST Program that supports The Global Challenge Award ITEST Program. STEM programs have been implemented in some [[Arizona]] schools. They implement higher cognitive skills for students and enable them to inquire and use techniques used by professionals in the STEM fields.

The STEM Academy is a national nonprofit-status organization dedicated to improving STEM literacy for all students. It represents a recognized national next-generation high-impact academic model. The practices, strategies, and programming are built upon a foundation of identified national best practices which are designed to improve under-represented minority and low-income student growth, close achievement gaps, decrease dropout rates, increase high school graduation rates and improve teacher and principal effectiveness. The STEM Academy represents a flexible use academic model that targets all schools and is for all students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stem101.org/about.asp|title=stemacademy|website=Stem101.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Project Lead The Way]] (PLTW) is a leading provider of STEM education curricular programs to middle and high schools in the United States. The national nonprofit organization has over 5,200 programs in over 4,700 schools in all 50 states. Programs include a high school engineering curriculum called ''Pathway To Engineering'', a high school biomedical sciences program, and a middle school engineering and technology program called ''Gateway To Technology''. PLTW provides the curriculum and the teacher professional development and ongoing support to create transformational programs in schools, districts, and communities. PLTW programs have been endorsed by President [[Barack Obama]] and [[United States Secretary of Education]] [[Arne Duncan]] as well as various state, national, and business leaders.

====Legislation====
The [[America COMPETES Act]] (P.L. 110-69) became law on August 9, 2007. It is intended to increase the nation's investment in science and engineering research and in STEM education from kindergarten to graduate school and postdoctoral education. The act authorizes funding increases for the [[National Science Foundation]], [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] laboratories, and the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) Office of Science over FY2008–FY2010. Robert Gabrys, Director of Education at NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]], articulated success as increased student achievement, early expression of student interest in STEM subjects, and student preparedness to enter the workforce.

====Jobs====
In November 2012 the [[White House]] announcement before congressional vote on the STEM Jobs Act put President Obama in opposition to many of the Silicon Valley firms and executives who bankrolled his re-election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57556074-38/obama-opposes-silicon-valley-firms-on-immigration-reform/ |title=Obama opposes Silicon Valley firms on immigration reform |date=November 28, 2012 |author=Declan McCullagh |publisher=CNET |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Labor identified 14 sectors that are "projected to add substantial numbers of new jobs to [[Economy of the United States|the economy]] or affect the growth of other industries or are being transformed by technology and innovation requiring new sets of skills for workers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doleta.gov/Youth_services/pdf/STEM_Report_4%2007.pdf |title=The STEM Workforce Challenge: the Role of the Public Workforce System in a National Solution for a Competitive Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Workforce |date=April 2007 |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The identified sectors were as follows: [[advanced manufacturing]], [[Automotive]], [[Construction industry|construction]], [[financial services]], [[geospatial technology]], [[homeland security]], [[information technology]], [[Transportation]], [[Aerospace]], [[Biotechnology]], [[Energy industry|energy]], [[Health care industry|healthcare]], [[Hospitality industry|hospitality]], and [[Retail industry|retail]].

The [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]] notes STEM fields careers are some of the best-paying and have the greatest potential for job growth in the early 21st century. The report also notes that STEM workers play a key role in the sustained growth and stability of the U.S. economy, and training in STEM fields generally results in higher wages, whether or not they work in a STEM field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.doc.gov/Reports/stem-good-jobs-now-and-future|title=STEM: Good Jobs Now and For the Future|work=doc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scouts Canada]] has taken similar measures to their American counterpart to promote STEM fields to youth. Their STEM program began in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scouts.ca/stem/activities.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811173225/http://www.scouts.ca/stem/activities.html |archivedate=2014-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Canadian entrepreneur and philanthropist [[Seymour Schulich]] established the [[Schulich Leader Scholarships]], $100 million in $60,000 scholarships for students beginning their university education in a STEM program at 20 institutions across Canada. Each year 40 Canadian students would be selected to receive the award, two at each institution, with the goal of attracting gifted youth into the STEM fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Toronto philanthropist Schulich unveils $100-million scholarship |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/toronto-philanthropist-schulich-unveils-100-million-scholarship/article2201382/|website=Theglobeandmail.com|accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program also supplies STEM scholarships to five participating universities in [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philanthropist Makes $100 Million Investment In Nation’s Future|url=http://www.shalomlife.com/news/16038/philanthropist-makes-100-million-investment-in-nations-future/|website=Shalomlife.com|accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
Several European projects have promoted STEM education and careers in Europe. For instance, Scientix&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientix Project|url=http://www.scientix.eu/|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a European cooperation of STEM teachers, education scientists, and policymakers. The SciChallenge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Achilleos|first1=Achilleas|last2=Mettouris|first2=Christos|last3=Yeratziotis|first3=Alexandros|last4=Papadopoulos|first4=George|last5=Pllana|first5=Sabri|last6=Huber|first6=Florian|last7=Jaeger|first7=Bernhard|last8=Leitner|first8=Peter|last9=Ocsovszky|first9=Zsofia|last10=Dinnyes|first10=Andras|title=SciChallenge: A Social Media Aware Platform for Contest-Based STEM Education and Motivation of Young Students|journal=IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies|date=March 2018|doi=10.1109/TLT.2018.2810879|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8305513/?reload=true|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; project used a social media contest and the student-generated content to increase motivation of pre- university students for STEM education and careers.

=== Hong Kong ===
STEM education has not been promoted among the local schools in Hong Kong until recent years. In November 2015, the Education Bureau of Hong Kong released a document entitled ''Promotion of STEM Education'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edb.gov.hk/attachment/en/curriculum-development/renewal/Brief%20on%20STEM%20(Overview)_eng_20151105.pdf|format=PDF|title=Promotion of STEM Education |website=Edb.gov.hk|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which proposes the strategies and recommendations on promoting STEM education.

===Turkey===
Turkish STEM Education Task Force (or FeTeMM—Fen Bilimleri, Teknoloji, Mühendislik ve Matematik) is a coalition of academicians and teachers who show an effort to increase the quality of education in STEM fields rather than focussing on increasing the number of STEM graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FeTeMM Çalışma Grubu|url=http://fetemm.org/|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=STEM Education Task Force|url=http://tstem.com/|website=Tstem.com |accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qatar===
In [[Qatar]], [[AL-Bairaq]] is an outreach program to high-school students with a curriculum that focuses on STEM, run by the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM) at [[Qatar University]]. Each year around 946 students, from about 40 high schools, participate in AL-Bairaq competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/index.php|title=AlBairaq World - Welcome to Al-Bairaq World|date=19 April 2014|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=20 August 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419220638/http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/index.php|archivedate=19 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; AL-Bairaq make use of project-based learning, encourages students to solve authentic problems, and inquires them to work with each other as a team to build real solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov.qa/En/Media/News/Pages/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsID=3405|title=Supreme Education Council|website=Sec.gov.qa|accessdate=2017-08-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630045928/http://www.sec.gov.qa/En/Media/News/Pages/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsID=3405|archivedate=2017-06-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepeninsulaqatar.com/news/qatar/283245/al-bairaq-holds-workshop-for-high-school-students|title=The Peninsula Qatar - Al Bairaq holds workshop for high school students|website=Thepeninsulaqatar.com|accessdate=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has so far shown positive results for the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejes.eu/images/issue/vol.1/no.3/4.pdf|title=Al-Ghanim, K.A; Al-Maadeed, M.A and Al-Thani, N.J (Sept. 2014) : IMPACT OF INNOVATIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT BASED ON RESEARCH ACTIVITIES ON SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS' ATTITUDE TOWARDS RESEARCH AND THEIR SELF-EFFICACY, EJES, 1(3), 39-57|website=Ejes.eu|accessdate=2017-08-20}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vietnam ===
In Vietnam, beginning in 2012 many private education organizations has STEM education initiatives.

In 2015, the Ministry of Science and Technology and Liên minh STEM organized the first National STEM day, followed by many similar events across the country.

in 2015, Ministry of Education and Training included STEM as an area needed to be encouraged in national school year program.

In May 2017, Prime Minister signed a [http://vanban.chinhphu.vn/portal/page/portal/chinhphu/hethongvanban?class_id=2&amp;mode=detail&amp;document_id=189610 Directive no. 16] stating: "Dramatically change the policies, contents, education and vocational training methods to create a human resource capable of receiving new production technology trends, with a focus on promoting training in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), foreign languages, information technology in general education; " and asking "Ministry of Education and Training (to): Promote the deployment of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education in general education program; Pilot organize in some high schools from 2017 to 2018.

==Women==

Women constitute 47% of the U.S. workforce, and perform 24% of STEM-related jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.doc.gov/reports/women-stem-2017-update|title=Women in STEM: 2017 Update| access-date=September 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK women perform 13% of STEM-related jobs (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/business/2014/science-careers-face-diversity-challenge|title=Science careers face diversity challenge|work=westminster.ac.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018110732/http://www.westminster.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/business/2014/science-careers-face-diversity-challenge|archivedate=2014-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. women with STEM degrees are more likely to work in education or healthcare rather than STEM fields compared with their male counterparts.

The gender ratio depends on field of study. For example, in the [[European Union]] in 2012 women made up 47.3% of the total, 51% of the social sciences, business and law, 42% of the science, mathematics and computing, 28% of engineering, manufacturing and construction, and 59% of PhD graduates in Health and Welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|date= 2016|title= She Figures 2015|url= https://ec.europa.eu/research/swafs/pdf/pub_gender_equality/she_figures_2015-final.pdf#view=fit&amp;pagemode=none|publisher= European Commission|page= |access-date= 15 September 2018 |ISBN=978-92-79-48375-2|doi=10.2777/744106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The focus on increasing participation in STEM fields has attracted criticism. In the 2014 article "The Myth of the Science and Engineering Shortage" in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', demographer Michael S. Teitelbaum criticized the efforts of the U.S. government to increase the number of STEM graduates, saying that, among studies on the subject, "No one has been able to find any evidence indicating current widespread labor market shortages or hiring difficulties in science and engineering occupations that require bachelor's degrees or higher", and that "Most studies report that real wages in many—but not all—science and engineering occupations have been flat or slow-growing, and unemployment as high or higher than in many comparably-skilled occupations." Teitelbaum also wrote that the then-current national fixation on increasing STEM participation paralleled previous U.S. government efforts since [[World War II]] to increase the number of scientists and engineers, all of which he stated ultimately ended up in "mass layoffs, hiring freezes, and funding cuts"; including one driven by the [[Space Race]] of the late 1950s and 1960s, which he wrote led to "a bust of serious magnitude in the 1970s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Myth of the Science and Engineering Shortage |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/03/the-myth-of-the-science-and-engineering-shortage/284359/ |first=Michael S. |last=Teitelbaum |work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[IEEE Spectrum]]'' contributing editor Robert N. Charette echoed these sentiments in the 2013 article "The STEM Crisis Is a Myth", also noting that there was a "mismatch between earning a STEM degree and having a STEM job" in the United States, with only around ¼ of STEM graduates working in STEM fields, while less than half of workers in STEM fields have a STEM degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The STEM Crisis Is a Myth |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/education/the-stem-crisis-is-a-myth |first=Robert N. |last=Charette |publisher=IEEE Spectrum |date=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economics writer Ben Casselman, in a 2014 study of post-graduation earnings for ''[[FiveThirtyEight]]'', wrote that, based on the data, science should not be grouped with the other three STEM categories, because, while the other three generally result in high-paying jobs, "many sciences, particularly the [[life sciences]], pay below the overall median for recent college graduates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major |url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/ |first=Ben |last=Casselman |publisher=FiveThirtyEight |date=September 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts to remedy the perceived domination of STEM subjects by men of Asian and non-Hispanic European backgrounds has led to intense efforts to diversify the STEM workforce. However, some critics feel that this practice in higher education, as opposed to a strict [[meritocracy]], causes lower academic standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Scribal abbreviations''' or '''''sigla''''' ([[grammatical number|singular]]: '''''siglum''''') are the [[abbreviation]]s used by ancient and medieval scribes writing in [[Latin]], and later in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Old Norse]]. In modern manuscript editing (substantive and mechanical) "sigla" are the symbols used to indicate the source manuscript (e.g. variations in text between different such manuscripts) and to identify the [[copyist]](s) of a work. See [[Critical apparatus]].

==History==
Abbreviated writing, using ''sigla'', arose partly from the limitations of the workable nature of the materials ([[rock (geology)|stone]], [[metal]], [[parchment]], etc.) employed in record-making and partly from their availability. Thus, [[lapidary|lapidaries]], [[engraver]]s, and [[copyist]]s made the most of the available writing space. Scribal abbreviations were infrequent when writing materials were plentiful, but by the 3rd and 4th centuries AD, writing materials were scarce and costly.

During the [[Roman Republic]], several abbreviations, known as ''sigla'' (plural of ''siglum'' = symbol or abbreviation), were in common use in inscriptions, and they increased in number during the [[Roman Empire]]. Additionally, in this period [[shorthand]] entered general usage. The earliest known Western shorthand system was that employed by the Greek historian [[Xenophon]] in the [[Memorabilia (Xenophon)|memoir of Socrates]], and it was called ''notae socratae''. In the late Roman Republic, the [[Tironian notes]] were developed possibly by [[Marcus Tullius Tiro]], Cicero's [[amanuensis]], in 63&amp;nbsp;BC to record information with fewer symbols; Tironian notes include a shorthand/syllabic alphabet notation different from the [[lower case|Latin minuscule hand]] and [[Roman square capitals|square]] and [[rustic capital]] letters. The notation was akin to modern [[stenographic]] writing systems. It used symbols for whole words or word roots and grammatical modifier marks, and it could be used to write either whole passages in shorthand or only certain words. In medieval times, the symbols to represent words were widely used; and the initial symbols, as few as 140 according to some sources, were increased to 14,000 by the [[Carolingians]], who used them in conjunction with other abbreviations. However, the alphabet notation had a "murky existence" (C. Burnett), as it was often associated with witchcraft and magic, and it was eventually forgotten. Interest in it was rekindled by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Thomas Becket]] in the 12th century and later in the 15th century, when it was rediscovered by [[Johannes Trithemius]], abbot of the Benedictine abbey of Sponheim, in a psalm written entirely in Tironian shorthand and a Ciceronian lexicon, which was discovered in a Benedictine monastery (''notae benenses'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=King |first1=David |year=2000 |title=[[The Ciphers of the Monks|The ciphers of the Monks: a Forgotten Number-Notation of the Middle Ages]] |publisher=[[Franz Steiner Verlag]] |publication-place=[[Stuttgart]] |ISBN=978-3-5150-7640-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To learn the Tironian note system, scribes required formal schooling in some 4,000 symbols; this later increased to some 5,000 symbols and then to some 13,000 in the medieval period (4th to 15th centuries AD);&lt;ref name=Guenin1908 &gt;{{citation |last=Guénin |first=Louis-Prosper |year=1908 |title=Histoire de la sténographie dans l'antiquité et au moyen-âge; les notes tironiennes |last2=Guénin |first2=Eugène |publisher=Paris, Hachette et cie |language=French |oclc=301255530}}&lt;/ref&gt; the meanings of some characters remain uncertain. ''Sigla'' were mostly used in [[lapidary]] inscriptions; in some places and historical periods (such as medieval Spain) scribal abbreviations were overused to the extent that some are indecipherable.

==Forms==
The abbreviations were not constant but changed from region to region. Scribal abbreviations increased in usage and reached their height in the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] (8th to 10th centuries). The most common abbreviations, called ''notae communes'', were used across most of Europe, but others appeared in certain regions. In legal documents, legal abbreviations, called ''notae juris'', appear but also capricious abbreviations, which scribes manufactured ''ad hoc'' to avoid repeating names and places in a given document.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay, Wallace Martin, ''Notae Latinae: An Account of Abbreviation in Latin Mss. Of the Early Minuscule Period (C. 700–850)'', 1915, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Scribal abbreviations can be found in epigraphy, sacred and legal manuscripts, written in Latin or in a vernacular tongue (but less frequently and with fewer abbreviations), either calligraphically or not.
[[File:Latin-breve.svg|frame|left|Latin abbreviations of {{lang|la|praedicatorum}}, {{lang|la|quoque}}, {{lang|la|conversis}}, and {{lang|la|quorum}}.]]{{Clear}}
In [[epigraphy]], common abbreviations were comprehended in two observed classes:
*The abbreviation of a word to its initial letter;
*The abbreviation of a word to its first consecutive letters or to several letters, from throughout the word.

Both forms of abbreviation are called "suspensions" (as the scribe suspends the writing of the word). A separate form of abbreviation is by "contraction" and was mostly a Christian usage for sacred words, [[Nomina Sacra]]; non-Christian sigla usage usually limited the number of letters the abbreviation comprised and omitted no intermediate letter. One practice was rendering an overused, formulaic phrase only as a siglum: DM for ''[[Manes|Dis Manibus]]'' ("Dedicated to the Manes"); [[Christogram|IHS]] from the first three letters of "[[Jesus|ΙΗΣΟΥΣ]]"; and RIP for ''[[requiescat in pace]]'' ("Rest in Peace") because the long-form written usage of the abbreviated phrase, by itself, was rare. According to Trabe, these abbreviations are not really meant to lighten the burden of the scribe but rather to shroud in reverent obscurity the holiest words of the Christian religion.&lt;ref&gt;Traube, Ludwig, Nomina sacra: Versuch einer Geschichte der Christlichen Kürzung, Munich,1907&lt;/ref&gt;

Another practice was repeating the abbreviation's final consonant a given number of times to indicate a group of as many persons: AVG denoted "Augustus", thus, AVGG denoted "Augusti duo"; however, lapidaries took typographic liberties with that rule, and instead of using COSS to denote "Consulibus duobus", they invented the CCSS form. Still, when occasion required referring to three or four persons, the complex doubling of the final consonant yielded to the simple plural siglum. To that effect, a ''[[vinculum (symbol)|vinculum]]'' (overbar) above a letter or a letter-set also was so used, becoming a universal medieval typographic usage. Likewise the ''[[tilde]]'' (~), an undulated, curved-end line, came into standard late-medieval usage.

Besides the ''tilde'' and [[macron (diacritic)|macron]] marks, above and below letters, modifying cross-bars and extended strokes were employed as scribal abbreviation marks, mostly for prefixes and verb, noun and adjective suffixes. The ''typographic'' abbreviations should not be confused with the ''phrasal'' abbreviations: '''''i.e.''''' (''id est'' — "that is"); '''''loc. cit.''''' (''loco citato'' — "in the passage already cited"); '''''viz.''''' (''vide licet'' — "namely", "that is to say", "in other words" — formed with "vi" and the ''[[yogh]]''-like glyph [Ꝫ], [ꝫ], the siglum for the suffix '''''-et''''' and the conjunction '''''et''''') and '''''et cetera'''''.

Moreover, besides scribal abbreviations, ancient texts also contained variant typographic characters, including [[typographic ligature|ligatures]] (e.g. '''Æ''', '''Œ''', etc.), the [[long s]] ('''ſ'''), and the [[half r]], resembling an Arabic numeral two ("2"). The "u" and "v" characters originated as scribal variants for their respective letters, likewise the "i" and "j" pair. Modern publishers printing Latin-language works replace variant typography and sigla with full-form Latin spellings; the convention of using "u" and "i" for vowels and "v" and "j" for consonants is a late typographic development.

===Scribal sigla in modern use===
====Latin script====
Some ancient and medieval sigla are still used in English and other European languages; the Latin [[ampersand]] (&amp;) replaces the conjunction ''and'' in English, ''et'' in Latin and French, and ''y'' in Spanish (but its use in Spanish is frowned upon, since the ''y'' is already smaller and easier to write). The Tironian sign '''⁊''', resembling the digit seven ("7"), represents the conjunction ''et'' and is written only to the [[x-height]]; in current [[Irish language]] usage, the siglum denotes the conjunction ''agus'' ("and"). Other scribal abbreviations in modern typographic use are the [[percentage]] sign ('''%'''), from the Italian ''per cento'' ("per hundred"); the [[permille]] sign ('''‰'''), from the Italian ''per mille'' ("per thousand"); the [[pound sign]] ('''₤''', '''£''' and '''#''', all descending from '''℔''' or '''lb''', ''librum'') and the [[dollar sign]] ('''$'''), which possibly derives from the Spanish word ''Peso''. The [[commercial at]] symbol ('''@'''), originally denoting "at the rate/price of", is a ligature derived from the English preposition ''at''; from the 1990s, its use outside commerce became widespread, as part of [[e-mail address]]es.

Typographically, the ampersand ("&amp;"), representing the word ''et'', is a space-saving [[ligature (typography)|ligature]] of the letters "e" and "t", its component [[graphemes]]. Since the establishment of movable-type printing in the 15th century, founders have created many such ligatures for each set of record type (font) to communicate much information with fewer symbols. Moreover, during the [[Renaissance]] (14th to 17th centuries), when [[Ancient Greek]] language [[Ancient Greek literature|manuscripts]] introduced that tongue to [[Western Europe]], its scribal abbreviations were converted to ligatures in imitation of the Latin scribal writing to which readers were accustomed. Later, in the 16th century, when the culture of publishing included Europe's vernacular languages, Graeco-Roman scribal abbreviations disappeared, an ideologic deletion ascribed to the anti-[[Latinist]] [[Protestant Reformation]] (1517–1648).

The common abbreviation "Xmas," for [[Christmas]], is a remnant of an old scribal abbreviation that substituted the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] [[chi (letter)|chi]] (Χ, resembling Latin X and representing the first letter in the Greek word for Christ, Χριστος) for the word Christ.

====Church Slavonic====
[[File:ChurchSlavonicSigla.tiff|thumb|350px|right|Sigla frequently used in contemporary Church Slavonic]]
After the invention of printing, manuscript copying abbreviations continued to be employed in [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]] and are still in use in printed books as well as on icons and inscriptions. Many common long roots and nouns describing sacred persons are abbreviated and written under the special [[diacritic]] symbol [[titlo]], as shown in the figure at the right. That corresponds to the Nomina sacra (Latin: "Sacred names") tradition of using contractions for certain frequently-occurring names in [[Koine Greek|Greek]] ecclesiastical texts. However, sigla for personal nouns are restricted to "good" beings and the same words, when referring to "bad" beings, are spelled out; for example, while "God" in the sense of the one true God is abbreviated as "{{script/Slavonic|бг҃ъ}}", "god" referring to "false" gods is spelled out. Likewise, the word for "angel" is generally abbreviated as "{{script/Slavonic|агг҃лъ}}", but the word for "angels" is spelled out for "performed by evil angels" in Psalm 77.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gamanovich |first=Alipi |title=Grammatika Tserkovno-Slavyanskago Yazyka |publisher=Holy Trinity Monastery |origyear=1964|year=1984 |location=Jordanville, NY |page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abbreviation types==
Adriano Cappelli's ''Lexicon Abbreviaturarum'',&lt;ref&gt;Cappelli 2011 (first published 1899).&lt;/ref&gt; enumerates the various medieval brachigraphic signs found in Latin and Italian vulgar texts, which originate from the Roman sigla, a symbol to express a word, and Tironian notes. Quite rarely, abbreviations did not carry marks to indicate that an abbreviation has occurred: if they did, they were often [[scribal error|copying errors]]. For example, "e.g." is written with periods, but modern terms, such as "PC", may be written in uppercase.

It should be noted that the original manuscripts were not written in a modern sans-serif or serif font but in Roman capitals, rustic, uncial, insular, Carolingian or blackletter styles. For more, refer to [[Western calligraphy]] or a beginner's guide.&lt;ref&gt;The Calligrapher's Bible: 100 Complete Alphabets and How to Draw Them, David Harris, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the abbreviations employed varied across Europe. In Nordic texts, for instance, two [[runes]] were used in text written in the Latin alphabet, which are ᚠ for ''fé'' "cattle, goods" and ᛘ for ''maðr'' "man".

Cappelli divides abbreviations into six overlapping categories:
*by suspension (''troncamento'')
*by contraction (''contrazione'')
*with independent meaning (''con significato proprio'')
*with relative meaning (''con significato relativo'')
*by superscript letters (''per lettere sovrapposte'')
*by convention (''segni convenzionali'')

===Suspension===
[[File:Truncation spec example.svg|thumb|Examples for suspension type]]
Suspended terms are those of which only the first part is written, and the last part is substituted by a mark, which can be of two types:
; General: indicating there has been an abbreviation but not how. The marks are placed above or across the [[ascender (typography)|ascender]] of the letters.
:[[File:Truncation gen.svg|frameless|none|300px]]
: The final three of the series are knot-like and are used in papal or regal documents.
; Specific: indicating that a truncation has occurred.
:[[File:Truncation spec.svg|frameless|none|300px]]
:The third case is a stylistic alternative found in several fonts, here Andron ([http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/UA720.pdf Unicode chart extended D]).

The largest class of suspensions consists of single letters standing in for words that begin with that letter.

A dot at the baseline after a capital letter may stand for a title if it is used such as in front of names or a person's name in medieval legal documents. However, not all sigla use the beginning of the word.
[[File:Truncation example exceptions.svg|thumb|Exceptions: sigla not using the first letter of the abbreviated word|150px]]

For plural words, the siglum is often doubled: "F." = ''frater'' and "FF." = ''fratres''. Tripled sigla often stand for three: "DDD" = ''domini tres''.

Letters lying on their sides, or mirrored (backwards), often indicate female titles, but a mirrored C, Ↄ, stands generally for ''con'' or ''contra'' (the latter sometimes with a macron above, "Ↄ̄").

To avoid confusion with abbreviations and numerals, the latter are often written with a bar above. In some contexts, however, numbers with a line above indicate that number is to be multiplied by a thousand, and several other abbreviations also have a line above them, such as "ΧΡ" (Greek letters chi+rho) = ''Christus'' or "IHS" = ''Jesus''.

Starting in the 8th or the 9th century, single letter sigla grew less common and were replaced by longer, less-ambiguous sigla, with bars above them.

===Contraction===
Abbreviations by contraction have one or more middle letters omitted. They were often represented with a general mark of abbreviation (above), such as a line above. They can be divided into two subtypes:
; pure: a pure contraction keeps only the first (one or more) and last (one or more) letters but not intermediate letters. Special cases arise when a contraction keeps only the first and last letter of a word, resulting in a two-letter sigla.
; mixed (impure): a mixed contraction keeps one or more intermediate letters of the word that is abridged.

===Marks with independent meaning===
[[File:Indip abbr.svg|thumb|Examples of independent marks]]
Such marks inform the reader of the identity of the missing part of the word without affecting (''independent'' of) the meaning. Some of them may be interpreted as alternative contextual glyphs of their respective letters.
*The straight or curved macron above a letter means that an ''n'' or ''m'' is missing. A remnant can be seen in Spanish where an ''n'' with a tilde ([[ñ]]) is used for {{IPAblink|ɲ}}. In Visigoth texts before the 9th century, however, a dot is placed above the macron to indicate ''m'', and the same mark without a dot meant ''n''. The line with a dot became the general mark after the 9th century in Visigoth texts.
*A mark, resembling the [[Arabic numeral]] ''9'' or a mirrored ''C'' in Gothic texts, is one of the oldest signs and can be found in the texts of [[Marcus Valerius Probus]] and Tironian notes with the same meaning as ''con''.
*Another mark, similar to a bold comma or a superscript ''9'', placed after the letter on the median line, represented ''us'' or ''os'', generally at the end of the word, being the [[nominative case]] [[affix]] of the [[Latin declension#Second declension (0)|second declension]], sometimes ''is'' or simply ''s''. The [[apostrophe]] used today originated from various marks in sigla, which caused its current use in elision, such as in the [[Saxon genitive]].
*A wave-like or omicron-like mark stands for a missing ''r'' (rhotic consonant) or ''ra''. Sometimes, a similar wave-like mark at the end of a word indicated a missing ''-a'' or syllable ending in ''-a''. This is, however, a coincidence, as one of the marks stems from a small ''r''-like mark and the other from an ''a''-like one. In later texts, it became a [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] (two dots), or a broken line.
*A mark, resembling the Arabic numeral 2 and placed on the median line after the letter, indicates ''tur'' or ''ur'', which occurs generally at the end of the word. Alternatively it could stand for ''ter'' or ''er'' but not at the end of the word. (Nordic languages, such as Old English, have a lightning-bolt-like mark for words ending in ''er''.)
*The [[r rotunda]] with a cut generally stood for ''-rum'', but it could also stand for a truncation after the letter ''r''.
*A last mark, which could either be the Tironian note ⁊ or the [[ampersand]] &amp;, was used with equal frequency as the conjunction ''et'' (and) or as ''et'' in any part of the word. The symbol ⁊ at the end of a word indicates the enclitic ''-que'' (and). A corruption occurs in some manuscripts between it and the ''us''/''os'' mark.

===Marks with relative meaning===
[[File:Rel abbr.svg|thumb|Examples for relative marks]]
The meaning of the marks depends on the letter on which they appear.
*A macron not fully above the character but crossing the descender or ascender:
*: ''b̵'', ''b̄'' – ''bre-'', ''ber-'', ''-ub''
*: ''c̄'' (with a link on the right) – ''cum'', ''con'', ''cen-''
*: ꝯ̄ (above) –''quondam''
*: ''d̵'', ''d̄'' – ''de-'', ''der'', ''-ud'' (a crossed ''d'', not ''ð'' = [[eth]])
*: ''h̵'', ''h̄'' – ''haec'', ''hoc'', ''her''
*: ꝉ – ''vel'', ''ul-'', ''-el''
*: ''m̄'' (above) – ''mem-'', ''mun-''
*: ''n̄'' (above) – ''non'', ''nun-''
*: ''ꝋ'' (crossed horizontally, not [[Danish language|Danish]] ''ø'') – ''oblit''
*: ''p̱'' – ''per'', ''par-'', ''por-''
*: ''p̄'' (above) – ''prae'', ''pre-'' (alternatively, a mark similar to ''-us'' comma above but with a small spiral glyph could be used for this meaning, and it is also valid above the letter ''q'')
*: ''p̄p̄'' (above) or ''p̱p̱'' (below) – ''propter'', ''papa''
*: ''q̱'' – ''qui'' and, in Italy, ''que'', but in England ''quam'', ''quia''
*: ''q̄'' above – ''quae''
*: ''q̄q̄'' (above) or ''q̱q̱'' (below) – ''quoque''
*: ''q̱̃'' (tilde above and line below) – ''quam''
*: ''t̵'' – ''ter-'', ''tem-'', ''ten-''
*: ''ū'', ''v̄'' (above) – ''ven-'', ''ver'', ''-vit''
*A dot, two dots, comma and dot (different from a semicolon), and the Arabic numeral 3-like mark ꝫ were generally at the end of a word on the baseline. After ''b'', they mean ''-us'' (semicolon-like and ꝫ also could mean ''-et''). After ''q'', they form the conjunction ''-que'' (meaning "and" but attached to the end of the last word) with semicolon-like and ꝫ the ''q'' could be omitted. Semicolon-like, in Lombard documents, above ''s'' meant ''-sis''. The dot above median line on an ''h'' – ''hoc''. Dot above ''u'' – ''ut'' or ''uti''. The ꝫ could mean ''-est'', or after ''a'', ''e'', ''u'' vowels meant ''-m'' not ''us'' or ''ei'', if after an ''o'' it meant ''-nem''. In certain papers the ꝫ mark can be confused with a cut ''r'' rotunda (handwritten 4-like).
**A dot to the left and right of a letter gave the following meanings: ''e'' – ''.e.'' ''est'', ''i'' – ''.i.'' ''id est'', ''n'' – ''.n.'' ''enim'', ''q'' – ''.q.'' ''quasi'', ''s'' – ''.s.'' ''scilicet'', ''t'' – ''.t.'' ''tune'', .ꝯ. – ''quondam'', .⁊. ''etiam''.
*A diagonal line, often hooked, mark crossing nearly all the letters gives a different meaning. Commonly a missing ''er'', ''ar'', ''re''. Variants of which were placed above and were ¿-like&lt;!--rotated question mark--&gt;, tilde (crossing ascender) and similar to the ''us'' mark. These, used in various combinations, allow for various uses giving additional meanings.
*2-like mark, after a ''q'' – ''qꝛ'' ''quia''. After 15th century alone ꝛ ''et'' (being similar to ⁊) and alone with line above ꝛ̄ ''etiam''. After ''u'' and ''a'' at the end of a word (''uꝛ'', ''aꝛ'') ''m'', after ''s'' – ''sꝛ'', ''ſꝛ'' ''et'' or ''ed''.

===Stacked or superscript letters===
A superscript letter generally referred to the letter omitted, but, in some instances, as in the case of vowel letters, it could refer to a missing vowel combined with the letter ''r'', before or after it. It is only in some English dialects that the letter ''r'' before another consonant largely silent and the preceding vowel is "[[r-coloured]]".

However, ''a'', ''i'', and ''o'' above ''g'' meant ''gͣ'' ''gna'', ''gͥ'' ''gni'' and ''gͦ'' ''gno'' respectively. Although in English, the ''g'' is silent in ''[[gn (digraph)|gn]]'', but in other languages, it is pronounced. Vowel letters above ''q'' meant ''qu'' + vowel: ''qͣ'', ''qͤ'', ''qͥ'', ''qͦ'', ''qͧ''.

*''a'' on ''r'': ''rͣ'' – ''regula''
*''o'' on ''m'': ''mͦ'' – ''modo''

Vowels were the most common superscripts, but consonants could be placed above letters without ascenders; the most common were ''c'', e.g. ''nͨ''. A cut ''l'' above an ''n'', ''nᷝ'', meant ''nihil'' for instance.

===Convention marks===
These marks are nonalphabetic letters carrying a particular meaning. Several of them continue in modern usage, as in the case of monetary symbols. In Unicode, they are referred to as ''letter-like glyphs''. Additionally, several authors are of the view that the Roman numerals themselves were, for example, nothing less than abbreviations of the words for those numbers. Other examples of symbols still in some use are [[alchemical symbol|alchemical]] and [[zodiac]] symbols, which were, in any case, employed only in alchemy and astrology texts, which made their appearance beyond that special context rare.

==Other==
{{See also|Palaeography|Illuminated manuscript |Typographic ligature|Breviograph}}
In addition to the signs used to signify abbreviations, medieval manuscripts feature some glyphs that are now uncommon but were not sigla.
Many more [[typographic ligature|ligatures]] were used to reduce the space occupied, a characteristic that is particularly prominent in blackletter scripts.
Some [[:Category:Palaeographic letter variants|letter variants]] such as [[r rotunda]], [[long s]] and uncial or insular variants ([[Insular G]]), [[Claudian letters]] were in common use, as well as letters derived from other scripts such as Nordic runes: [[thorn (letter)|thorn (þ=th)]] and [[eth (letter)|eth (ð=dh)]].
An [[illuminated manuscript]] would feature [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]], [[initial|decorated initials]] or ''littera notabilior'', which later resulted in the [[letter case#Bicameral script|bicamerality]] of the script (case distinction).

==Typographic replication==
[[File:Domesday Croydon Cheam.jpg|thumb|right|Entries for [[Croydon]] and [[Cheam]], [[Surrey]], in [[Domesday Book]] (1086), as published using [[record type]] in 1783.]]
Various [[typeface]]s have been designed to allow scribal abbreviations and other archaic glyphs to be replicated in print. They include "[[record type]]", which was first developed in the 1770s to [[publication of Domesday Book|publish Domesday Book]] and was fairly widely used for the publication of medieval records in Britain until the end of the 19th century.

'''Sexology''' is the scientific study of [[human sexuality]], including human sexual interests, [[Human sexual activity|behavior]]s and functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sexology|title=Sexology|work=Merriam Webster|accessdate=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''sexology'' does not generally refer to the non-scientific study of sexuality, such as [[political science]] or [[social criticism]].&lt;ref name =Bullough1989/&gt;&lt;ref name=Haeberle/&gt;

Sexologists apply tools from several academic fields, such as [[biology]], [[medicine]], [[psychology]], [[epidemiology]], [[sociology]], and [[criminology]]. Topics of study include [[sexual development]] (puberty), [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], [[sexual relationship]]s, sexual activities, [[paraphilia]]s, atypical sexual interests.  It also includes the study of sexuality across the lifespan, including [[child sexuality]], [[puberty]], [[adolescent sexuality]], and [[geriatric sexology|sexuality among the elderly]]. Sexology also spans sexuality among the mentally and/or physically disabled. The sexological study of [[sexual dysfunction]]s and disorders, including [[erectile dysfunction]], [[anorgasmia]], and [[pedophilia]], are also mainstays.

==History==
===Early===
[[sex manual|Sexual manuals]] have existed since antiquity, such as [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'', the ''[[Kama Sutra]]'' of [[Vatsyayana]], the ''[[Ananga Ranga]]'' and ''[[The Perfumed Garden|The Perfumed Garden for the Soul's Recreation]]''.  {{lang|fr|De la prostitution dans la ville de Paris}} (''Prostitution in the City of Paris''), an early 1830s study on 3,558 registered prostitutes in [[Paris]], published by Alexander Jean Baptiste Parent-Duchatelet (and published in 1837, a year after he died), has been called the first work of modern sex research.&lt;ref name=Bullough1989&gt;Bullough, V. L. (1989). ''The society for the scientific study of sex: A brief history.'' Mt. Vernon, Iowa: The Foundation for the Scientific Study of Sexuality.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific study of sexual behavior in human beings began in the 19th century. Shifts in [[Europe]]'s national borders at that time brought into conflict laws that were sexually liberal and laws that criminalized behaviors such as homosexual activity.

===Victorian Era to WWII===
[[File:Portrait of Havelock Ellis (1859-1939), Psychologist and Biologist (2575987702) crop.jpg|thumb|[[Havelock Ellis]], a pioneering figure in the movement towards sexual emancipation in the late 19th century.]]

Despite the prevailing social attitude of sexual repression in [[Victorian morality|the Victorian era]], the movement towards sexual emancipation began towards the end of the nineteenth century in England and Germany. In 1886, [[Richard Freiherr von Krafft-Ebing]] published ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis (book)|Psychopathia Sexualis]].'' That work is considered as having established sexology as a scientific discipline.&lt;ref name = Hoenig1977&gt;Hoenig, J. (1977). Dramatis personae: Selected biographical sketches of 19th century pioneers in sexology. In J. Money and H. Musaph (Eds.), ''Handbook of Sexology,'' (pp. 21-43). Elsevier/North-Holland Biomedical Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, the founding father of sexology was the doctor and sexologist [[Havelock Ellis]] who challenged the sexual taboos of his era regarding [[masturbation]] and [[homosexuality]] and revolutionized the conception of sex in his time. His seminal work was the 1897 ''Sexual Inversion'', which describes the sexual relations of homosexual males, including men with boys. Ellis wrote the first objective study of homosexuality, (the term was coined by Kertbeny) as he did not characterize it as a disease, immoral, or a crime. The work assumes that same-sex love transcended age [[taboo]]s as well as gender taboos. Seven of his twenty-one case studies are of inter-generational relationships. He also developed other important psychological concepts, such as [[autoerotism]] and [[narcissism]], both of which were later developed further by [[Sigmund Freud]].&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Language of Psycho-analysis|author1=Laplanche, J.|author2=Pontalis, J.B.|date=1988|publisher=Karnac Books|isbn=9780946439492|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;pg=PA45|page=45|accessdate=July 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellis pioneered [[transgender]] phenomena alongside the German [[Magnus Hirschfeld]]. He established it as new category that was separate and distinct from homosexuality.&lt;ref name=ttp&gt;Ekins, Richard and King, Dave (2006) ''The transgender phenomenon'', SAGE, {{ISBN|0-7619-7163-7}}, pp. 61-64&lt;/ref&gt; Aware of Hirschfeld's studies of [[transvestism]], but disagreeing with his terminology, in 1913 Ellis proposed the term ''sexo-aesthetic inversion'' to describe the phenomenon.&lt;ref name=ellis1933&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Albert|title=Psychology of Sex|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NSLybrnLVeIC&amp;pg=PA209year=1933|isbn=9781443735322|publisher=Read Books|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5dNnT3GuF_gC&amp;dq=father+of+sexology+ellis|title=The Real Facts Of Life: Feminism And The Politics Of Sexuality C1850-1940|author=Jackson, Margaret|year=1994|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780203992395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, the first scholarly journal of the field, ''Journal of Sexology'' (Zeitschrift für Sexualwissenschaft), began publication and was published monthly for one year. Those issues contained articles by Freud, [[Alfred Adler]], and [[Wilhelm Stekel]].&lt;ref name=Haeberle&gt;Haeberle, E. J. (1983). ''The birth of sexology: A brief history in documents.'' World Association for Sexology.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, the first academic association was founded: the ''Society for Sexology''.&lt;ref&gt;Kewenig, W. A. (1983). Foreword. In E. J. Haeberle, ''The birth of sexology: A brief history in documents''. World Association for Sexology. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud developed a theory of sexuality. These stages of development include: Oral, Anal, Phallic, Latency and Genital. These stages run from infancy to puberty and onwards.&lt;ref name="gutenberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14969 |title=Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex by Sigmund Freud - Free Ebook |publisher=gutenberg.org|accessdate=July 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on his studies of his clients, between the late 19th and early 20th centuries. [[Wilhelm Reich]] and [[Otto Gross]], were disciples of Freud, but rejected by his theories{{vague|date=November 2013}} because of their emphasis on the role of sexuality in the revolutionary struggle for the emancipation of mankind.

[[Image:1933-may-10-berlin-book-burning.JPG|left|thumb|Hirschfeld's books were burned by the Nazis in Berlin for being "un-German".]]
Pre-Nazi Germany, under the sexually liberal [[Napoleonic code]], organized and resisted the anti-sexual, Victorian cultural influences. The momentum from those groups led them to coordinate sex research across traditional [[academic discipline]]s, bringing Germany to the leadership of sexology. Physician [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] was an outspoken advocate for sexual minorities, founding the [[Scientific Humanitarian Committee]], the first advocacy for homosexual and transgender rights.&lt;ref&gt;Goltz, Dustin (2008). Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer movements. In A. Lind &amp; S. Brzuzy (Eds.), ''Battleground: Women, gender, and sexuality, 2,'' 291. Greenwood Publishing Group, {{ISBN|978-0-313-34039-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hirschfeld also set up the first [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]] (Institute for Sexology) in Berlin in 1919. Its library housed over 20,000 volumes, 35,000 photographs, a large collection of art and other objects. People from around [[Europe]] visited the Institute to gain a clearer understanding of their [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and to be treated for their sexual concerns and dysfunctions.

Hirschfeld developed a system which identified numerous actual or hypothetical types of sexual intermediary between heterosexual male and female to represent the potential diversity of human sexuality, and is credited with identifying a group of people that today are referred to as [[transsexual]] or [[transgender]] as separate from the categories of homosexuality, he referred to these people as 'transvestiten' (transvestites).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last= Hirschfeld | first= Magnus | title= Die Transvestiten.

Other sexologists in the early [[gay rights]] movement included [[Ernst Burchard]], [[Hans Blüher]], and [[Benedict Friedlaender]]. [[Ernst Gräfenberg]], after whom the [[G-spot]] is named, published the initial research developing the [[intrauterine device]] (IUD).

===Post WWII===
After World War II, sexology experienced a renaissance, both in the United States and Europe. Large scale studies of sexual behavior, sexual function, and [[sexual dysfunction]] gave rise to the development of [[sex therapy]].&lt;ref name=Haeberle/&gt; Post-WWII sexology in the U.S. was influenced by the influx of European refugees escaping the Nazi regime and the popularity of the [[Kinsey Reports|Kinsey studies]]. Until that time, American sexology consisted primarily of groups working to end [[prostitution]] and to educate youth about [[sexually transmitted diseases]].&lt;ref name =Bullough1989/&gt; [[Alfred Kinsey]] founded the [[Institute for Sex Research]] at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]] at [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]] in 1947. This is now called the [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction]]. He wrote in his 1948 book that more was scientifically known about the sexual behavior of farm animals than of humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kinsey | first1 = Alfred C. | last2 = Martin | first2 = Clyde E. | last3 = Pomeroy | first3 = Wardell B. | author-link1 = Alfred Kinsey | author-link2 = Clyde Martin | author-link3 = Wardell Pomeroy | title = Sexual behavior in the human male | page = 3 | publisher = W.B.

Psychologist and sexologist [[John Money]] developed theories on sexual identity and [[gender identity]] in the 1950s. His work, notably on the [[David Reimer]] case has since been regarded as controversial, even while the case was key to the development of treatment protocols for [[intersex]] infants and children.&lt;ref name="diamond"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Diamond | first1 = Milton | last2 = Sigmundson | first2 = H.

[[Kurt Freund]] developed the [[penile plethysmograph]] in [[Czechoslovakia]] in the 1950s. The device was designed to provide an objective measurement of [[sexual arousal]] in males and is currently used in the assessment of [[pedophilia]] and [[hebephilia]]. This tool has since been used with [[sex offenders]].&lt;ref name="apobit"&gt;{{cite news | last = Associated Press | title = Kurt Freund, 82, notable sexologist | url = http://www.s-t.com/daily/10-96/10-29-96/c06wn888.htm | date = October 26, 1996 }} {{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kubanobit"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kuban | first = Michael | title = Sexual Science Mentor: Dr. Kurt Freund | journal = Sexual Science | volume = 45 | issue = 2 | url = http://sexscience.org/uploads/media/sex_sci45-2.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101222215801/http://sexscience.org/uploads/media/sex_sci45-2.htm | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2010-12-22 | date = Summer 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 and 1970, [[Masters and Johnson]] released their works ''Human Sexual Response'' and ''Human Sexual Inadequacy,'' respectively. Those volumes sold well, and they were founders of what became known as the [[Masters &amp; Johnson Institute]] in 1978.

[[Vern Bullough]] was a historian of sexology during this era, as well as being a researcher in the field.&lt;ref name="vernbullough"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vernbullough.com/bullough/publications/publicationsindex.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040727172744/http://www.vernbullough.com/bullough/publications/publicationsindex.html |archivedate=July 27, 2004 |dead-url=yes |title=Dr. Vern L.

The emergence of [[HIV/AIDS]] in the 1980s caused a dramatic shift in sexological research efforts towards understanding and controlling the spread of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gagnon | first = John H. | title = Sex research and sexual conduct in the era of AIDS | journal = [[Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes]] | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 593–601 | publisher = [[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins]] | pmid = 3225745 | date = December 1988 | url = http://journals.lww.com/jaids/Abstract/1988/12000/Sex_Research_and_Sexual_Conduct_in_the_Era_of.11.aspx | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Oriel | first = Jennifer | title = Sexual pleasure as a human right: Harmful or helpful to women in the context of HIV/AIDS? | journal = [[Women's Studies International Forum]] | volume = 28 | issue = 5 | pages = 392–404 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/j.wsif.2005.05.002 | date = September 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wsif.2005.05.002 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.amherst.edu/media/view/248654/original/sexual+pleasure+as+a+HR.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social metabolism''' or '''socioeconomic metabolism''' is the set of [[Stock and flow|flow]]s of [[material]]s and [[energy]] that occur between [[Nature]] and [[society]], between different societies, and within societies. These human-controlled material and energy flows are a basic feature of all societies but their magnitude and diversity largely depend on specific [[culture|cultures]], or sociometabolic regimes.&lt;ref name= "Metabolism"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Manuel |first1= |last2= Toledo |first2= Víctor M. |year= 2014|title= The Social Metabolism: A Socio-Ecological Theory of Historical Change|url= https://books.google.es/books/about/The_Social_Metabolism.html?id=JwzvAwAAQBAJ| publisher= Springer |isbn= 978-3-319-06357-7 }}

Social or socioeconomic metabolism is also described as "the self-reproduction and evolution of the biophysical structures of human society. It comprises those biophysical transformation processes, distribution processes, and flows, which are controlled by humans for their purposes. The biophysical structures of society (‘in use stocks’) and socioeconomic metabolism together form the biophysical basis of society."
&lt;ref name="Pauliuk Hertwich 2015 pp. 83–93"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Pauliuk | first=Stefan | last2=Hertwich | first2=Edgar G. | title=Socioeconomic metabolism as paradigm for studying the biophysical basis of human societies | journal=Ecological Economics | volume=119 | year=2015 | issn=0921-8009 | doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.08.012 | pages=83–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social metabolic processes begin with the [[human]] ''appropriation'' of materials and energy from nature. These can be ''transformed'' and ''circulated'' to be ''consumed'' and ''excreted'' finally back to Nature itself. Each of these processes has a different [[environmental impact]] depending on how it is performed, the amount of materials and energy involved in the process, the area where it occurs, the time available or the Nature's regenerative capacity.&lt;ref name= "Metabolism"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "metabolismo"/&gt;

Social metabolism represents an extension of the metabolism concept from human bodies to the biophysical basis of society. Humans build and operate mines and farms, oil refineries and power stations, factories and infrastructure to supply the energy and material flows needed for the physical reproduction of a specific culture. In-use stocks, which comprise buildings, vehicles, appliances, infrastructure, etc., are built up and maintained by the different industrial processes that are part of social metabolism. These stocks then provide service to people in form of shelter, transportation, or communication.

Society and its metabolism together form an [[Autopoiesis|autopoietic]] system, a complex system that reproduces itself. Neither culture nor social metabolism can reproduce themselves in isolation. Humans need food and shelter, which is delivered by social metabolism, and the latter needs humans to operate it.

Studies of social metabolism can be carried out at different levels of system aggregation, see [[material flow analysis]]. In material flow accounting, for example, the [[Factor of production|inputs]] and [[Output (economics)|outputs]] of materials and energy of a particular [[State (polity)|state]] or region, as well as [[import]]s and [[export]]s, are analysed.

Social or socioeconomic metabolism stipulates that human society and its interaction with Nature form a complex  self-reproducing system, and it can therefore be seen as [[paradigm]] for studying the biophysical basis of human societies under the aspect of self-reproduction.

'''Sustainability standards and certifications''' are voluntary, usually third party-assessed, norms and standards relating to environmental, social, ethical and food safety issues, adopted by companies to demonstrate the performance of their organizations or products in specific areas.  There are perhaps up to 500 such standards{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} and the pace of introduction has increased in the last decade{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.  The trend started in the late 1980s and 90s with the introduction of [[Ecolabel]]s and standards for [[Organic food]] and other products. In recent years, numerous standards have been established and adopted in the food industry in particular{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Most of them refer to the triple bottom line of environmental quality, social equity, and economic prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1678472 Overview article on sustainability standards in the food industry]&lt;/ref&gt; A standard is normally developed by a broad range of stakeholders and experts in a particular sector and includes a set of practices or criteria for how a crop should be sustainable grown or a resource should be ethically harvested. This might cover, for instance, responsible fishing practices that don't endanger marine biodiversity, or respect for human rights and the payment of fair wages on a coffee or tea plantation. Normally sustainability standards are accompanied by a verification process - often referred to as "certification" - to evaluate that an enterprise complies with a standard, as well as a traceability process for certified products to be sold along the supply chain, often resulting in a consumer-facing label. Certification programmes also focus on capacity building and working with partners and other organisations to support smallholders or disadvantaged producers to make the social and environmental improvements needed to meet the standard.

The basic premise of sustainability standards is twofold.  Firstly, they emerged in areas where national and global legislation was weak but where the consumer and [[NGO]] movements around the globe demanded action.  For example, campaigns by Global Exchange&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030618203029/http://www.globalexchange.org/campaigns/sweatshops/nike/ |Global Exchange Campaign - Nike]&lt;/ref&gt; and other NGOs against the purchase of goods from “[[sweatshop]]” factories by the likes of [[Nike, Inc.]], [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.]] and other leading brands led to the emergence of social welfare standards like the [[SA8000]] and others.  Secondly, leading brands selling to both consumers and to the [[Business-to-business|B2B]] supply chain may wish to demonstrate the environmental or organic merits of their products, which has led to the emergence of hundreds of ecolabels{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}, organic and other standards.  A leading example of a consumer standard is the [[Fairtrade]] movement, administered by [[FLO International]] and exhibiting huge sales growth around the world for ethically sourced produce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/press_office/press_releases_and_statements/jun_2009/global_fairtrade_sales_increase_by_22.aspx Fairtrade Growth] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225094221/http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/press_office/press_releases_and_statements/jun_2009/global_fairtrade_sales_increase_by_22.aspx |date=2010-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of a [[Business-to-business|B2B]] standard which has grown tremendously in the last few years is the [[Forest Stewardship Council]]’s standard (FSC) for forest products made from sustainable harvested trees.

However, the line between consumer and B2B sustainability standards is becoming blurred, with leading trade buyers increasingly demanding Fairtrade certification, for example, and consumers increasingly recognizing the FSC mark. In recent years, the business-to-business focus of sustainability standards has risen as it has become clear that consumer demand alone cannot drive the transformation of major sectors and industries{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. In commodities such as palm oil, soy, farmed seafood, and sugar, certification initiatives are targeting the mainstream adoption of better practices and [[precompetitive]] industry collaboration. Major brands and retailers are also starting to make commitments to certification in their whole supply chain or product offering, rather than a single product line or ingredient{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} .

With the growth of standards and certification as the major tool for global production and trade to become more sustainable and for the private sector to demonstrate sustainability leadership, it is essential that there are ways to assess the legitimacy and performance of different initiatives. Company and government buyers, as well as NGOs and civil society groups committed to sustainable production, need clarity on which standards and ecolabels are delivering ''real'' social, environmental and economic results. The [[ISEAL Alliance]] has emerged as the authority on good practice for sustainability standards and its Codes of Good Practice represent the most widely recognised guidance on how standards should be set up and implemented in order to be effective{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. By complying with these Codes and working with other certification initiatives, ISEAL members demonstrate their credibility and work towards improving their positive impacts.

Attempts to address the problems caused by a multiplicity of certification initiatives led to the launch of [[State of Sustainability Initiatives|The State of Sustainability Initiatives (SSI)]] project, facilitated by the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) and the [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] (IISD) under the auspices of the Sustainable Commodity Initiative (SCI){{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

== Origin of global standards ==

''Most'' sustainability standards that are being adopted today were initiated by [[social movements]] in particular countries, such as Rainforest Alliance in the United States and Fairtrade in the Netherlands{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Other standards were initiated by individual companies, such as [[UTZ Certified|Utz Certified]] (Ahold), Starbucks C.A.F.E. (Starbucks), and Nespresso AAA (Nespresso). Some standards were launched by coalitions of private firms, development agencies, NGOs, and other stakeholders. For example, the Common Code for the Coffee Community (4C) was initiated by an alliance of large American coffee roasters, including [[Kraft Foods]], [[Sara Lee Corporation|Sara Lee]] and [[Nestle]], assisted by the German Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development ([[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit|GIZ]]). One important facilitator for the development of most global standards were series of local development projects involving NGOs, coffee roasters and producers in different developing countries. For example, the Fairtrade standard was developed based on pilot projects with Mexican farmers. 4C builds on development projects in Peru, Colombia and Vietnam, involving GIZ, major coffee roasters, and local producers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1668888 Article on the Development of the Common Code for the Coffee Community]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most widely established and adopted standards are in agriculture, with 40% of global coffee production certified to one of the main schemes, and approximately 15-20% of cocoa and tea production being compliant with major international standards. Forestry and wild seafood are also sectors in which standards have been influential, with certified production pushing past 10% of the global share. Cotton, palm oil, soy, biofuels and farmed seafood are some of the commodities in which certification is growing the fastest, due in part to major roundtables that have been set up to bring the whole industry together. More recently, standards have started to emerge for mining and the extraction of metals - including gold, silver, aluminium, and oil and gas - as well as for cattle, electronics, plastics and tourism.

Evidence suggests that Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) adopted willingly by firms will be much more effective than government regulated CSR so global standards by private companies show promise for effective social impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=J. Scott|last2=Green|first2=Kesten C.|title=Effects of corporate social responsibility and irresponsibility policies|journal=Journal of Business Research|date=2013|url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/43007/1/MPRA_paper_43007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of the [[ISEAL Alliance]] in 2002 was the first collaborative effort amongst a group of sustainability standards organisations to agree to follow common good practices in how their standards are implemented and also to work together to drive up the use of standards and certification globally.

== Different sustainability standards ==
{{Tone|date=May 2017}}

Numerous sustainability standards have been developed in recent years to address issues of environmental quality, social equity, and economic prosperity of global production and trade practices. Despite similarities in major goals and certification procedures, there are some significant differences in terms of their historical development, target groups of adopters, geographical diffusion, and emphasis on environmental, social or economic issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1678472 Introduction to different standards]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major differences to be aware of is based on the level of strictness of the standard. Some standards set the bar high for a sector, promoting the strongest social and environmental practices and working with the top performers to constantly push up sustainability expectations{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Other standards are more focused on the elimination of the worst practices and operate at more of an entry-level to get a large proportion of an industry working incrementally towards better practices. Often times there are strategies between standards to move producers along this performance ladder of sustainability{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Another important distinction is that some standards can be applied internationally (usually with mechanisms to ensure local relevance and appropriateness) whereas other standards are developed entirely with a regional or national focus{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

Additional differences between standards might relate to the certification process and whether it is conducted by a first, second or third party; the traceability system in place and whether it allows for the segregation or mixing of certified and non-certified materials; and the types of sustainability claims that are made on products.

=== Fairtrade ===

The [[Fairtrade]] label was developed in the late 1980s by a Dutch development agency in collaboration with Mexican farmers{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. The initiative performs [[development work]] and promotes its political vision of an [[alternative economy]], seeing its main objective in empowering small producers and providing these with access to and improving their position on global markets{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. The ''most distinguishing'' feature of the Fairtrade label is the guarantee of a minimum price and a [[social premium]] that goes to the cooperative and not to the producers directly. Recently{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}, Fairtrade also adopted environmental objectives as part of their certification system.

=== Rainforest Alliance ===
{{Tone|date=May 2017}}
The [[Rainforest Alliance]] was created in the late 1980s from a social movement and is committed to conserving rainforests and their biodiversity. One key element of the standard is the compulsory elaboration and implementation of a detailed plan for the development of a sustainable farm management system to assist wildlife conservation. Another objective is to improve workers’ welfare by establishing and securing ''sustainable'' livelihoods. Producer prices may carry a premium. Yet instead of guaranteeing a fixed [[floor price]], the standard seeks to improve the economic situation of producers through higher yields and enhanced cost efficiency{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

=== Utz Certified ===

[[UTZ Certified]] (formerly Utz Kapeh) was co-founded by the Dutch coffee roaster [[Ahold Coffee Company]] in 1997. It aims to create an open and transparent marketplace for socially and environmentally responsible agricultural products. ''Instruments'' include the UTZ Traceability System and the UTZ Code of Conduct. The traceability system makes certified products traceable from producer to final buyer and has ''stringent'' chains of custody requirements. The UTZ Code of Conduct emphasizes both environmental practices (e.g. biodiversity conservation, waste handling and water use) and social benefits (e.g. access to medical care, access to sanitary facilities at work).

=== Organic ===
The [[Organic farming|Organic]] standard was developed in the 1970s and is based on [[IFOAM]] Basic Standards{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. IFOAM stands for International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements and is the leading global umbrella organization for the organic farming movement. The IFOAM Basic Standards provide a framework of minimum requirements, including the omission of agrochemicals such as pesticides and chemical-synthetic fertilizers. The use of animal feeds is also strictly regulated. Genetic engineering and the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are forbidden{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

=== trustea ===

The [http://www.trustea.org trustea code] is designed to evaluate the social, economic, [[agronomic]] and environmental performance of Indian tea estates, smallholders and Bought Leaf Factories (BLFs).

It is expected that the compliance with the code not only improves competitiveness of the tea farms but also facilitates the tea farms in achieving compliance with national regulations and international sustainability standards in a step-wise approach. The applicable control points under eleven chapters are required to be adhered to within a four-year period. The India tea code allows producers to show that they operate responsibly– producing quality tea according to strict social and environmental standards. The verification under the code provides manufacturers with the assurance of responsible production and provides opportunities to credibly demonstrate this to their customers.

=== SuRe® – The Standard for Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure ===

SuRe® is a global voluntary standard which integrates key criteria of resilience and sustainability into infrastructure development, through various criteria across governance, social and environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gib-foundation.org/sure-standard/&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently developed under ISEAL guidelines by the Swiss [[Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation]] (GIB) and the French bank [[Natixis]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ictsd.org/bridges-news/bridges-africa/news/sustainable-trade-infrastructure-in-africa-a-key-element-for-growth&lt;/ref&gt; GIB and Natixis launched the SuRe® standard at a [[COP21]] event on 9 December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greeneconomycoalition.org/updates/gib-launches-sure%C2%AE-standard-cop21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other examples===
Other types of standards include sector-specific schemes such as the [[Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil]] (RSPO); standards for climate and development interventions like the Gold Standard, retailer-led sustainability certification initiatives such as [[GlobalGAP]];
Corporate own-brand sustainability initiatives such as [[Starbucks#Coffee and Farmer Equity .28C.A.F.E..29 practices|Starbucks' CAFE Practices]]; and national programmes such as the [[Bord Bia|Irish Food Board]]'s 'Origin Green' scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agritrade.cta.int/Agriculture/Topics/Product-differentiation/Special-report-Implications-of-sustainability-certification-schemes-for-the-ACP ''Agritrade'': Implications of sustainability certification schemes for the ACP] 16 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Forum on Sustainability Standards]] (UNFSS) is a joint initiative of FAO, UNEP, ITC, UNCTAD, and UNIDO on Sustainability Standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Forum on Sustainability Standards|url=https://unfss.org|website=UNFSS|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sustainable development''' is the [[organizing principle]] for meeting [[Human development (humanity)|human development]] goals while at the same time [[Sustainability|sustaining]] the ability of natural systems to provide the [[natural resource]]s and [[ecosystem services]] upon which the [[economy]] and [[society]] depend. The desired result is a state of society where living conditions and resource use continue to meet human needs without undermining the integrity and stability of the natural system. Sustainable development can be classified as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations.

While the modern concept of sustainable development is derived mostly from the 1987 [[Brundtland Commission|Brundtland Report]], it is also rooted in earlier ideas about [[sustainable forest management]] and twentieth century environmental concerns. As the concept developed, it has shifted to focus more on [[economic development]], [[Social change|social development]] and environmental protection for future generations. It has been suggested that "the term 'sustainability' should be viewed as humanity's target goal of human-ecosystem equilibrium (homeostasis), while 'sustainable development' refers to the holistic approach and temporal processes that lead us to the end point of sustainability".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shaker |first=Richard Ross |date=September 2015 |title=The spatial distribution of development in Europe and its underlying sustainability correlations |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622815001745 |journal=Applied Geography |volume=63 |pages=&lt;!-- 304–314 --&gt; |at=p. 35 |doi=10.1016/j.apgeog.2015.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern economies are endeavouring to reconcile ambitious economic development and obligations of preserving the [[natural resource]]s and [[Ecosystem services|ecosystem]], the two are traditionally seen as of conflicting nature. Instead of holding climate change commitments and other sustainability measures as a drug to economic development, turning and leveraging them into market opportunities will do greater good. The economic development brought by such organized principles and practices in an [[economy]] is called Managed Sustainable Development (MSD).

The concept of sustainable development has been—and still is—subject to criticism, including the question of what is to be sustained in sustainable development. It has been argued{{weasel inline|date=October 2018}} that there is no such thing as a sustainable use of a [[non-renewable resource]], since any positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to the exhaustion of earth's finite stock. The United Nations organized an international conference in Stockholm, Sweden from 5 to 16 June 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/unchedec.htm|title=Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment - A/CONF.48/14/Rev.1 Chapter I - UN Documents: Gathering a body of global agreements|last=Environment|first=United Nations Conference on the Human|website=www.un-documents.net|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainable development has its roots in ideas about [[sustainable forest management]] which were developed in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref name="Grober2"&gt;Ulrich Grober: Deep roots&amp;nbsp;— A conceptual history of "sustainable development" (Nachhaltigkeit), Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozialforschung, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blewitt-2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blewitt|first1=John|title=Understanding Sustainable Development|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415707824|edition=2nd|url=https://www.routledge.com/Understanding-Sustainable-Development-2nd-Edition/Blewitt/p/book/9780415707824|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|6-16}} In response to a growing awareness of the depletion of timber resources in England, [[John Evelyn]] argued that "sowing and planting of trees had to be regarded as a national duty of every landowner, in order to stop the destructive over-exploitation of natural resources" in his 1662 essay ''[[Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees and the Propagation of Timber|Sylva]]''. In 1713 [[Hans Carl von Carlowitz]], a senior mining administrator in the service of Elector [[Augustus II the Strong|Frederick Augustus I of Saxony]] published ''Sylvicultura oeconomica'', a 400-page work on forestry. Building upon the ideas of Evelyn and French minister [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], von Carlowitz developed the concept of managing forests for [[sustained yield]].&lt;ref name="Grober2" /&gt; His work influenced others, including [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and [[Georg Ludwig Hartig]], eventually leading to the development of a science of forestry. This in turn influenced people like [[Gifford Pinchot]], first head of the [[US Forest Service]], whose approach to forest management was driven by the idea of wise use of resources, and [[Aldo Leopold]] whose [[land ethic]] was influential in the development of the [[environmental movement]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Grober2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blewitt-2015"/&gt;

Following the publication of [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''[[Silent Spring]]'' in 1962, the developing environmental movement drew attention to the relationship between economic growth and development and environmental degradation. [[Kenneth E. Boulding]] in his influential 1966 essay ''The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth'' identified the need for the economic system to fit itself to the ecological system with its limited pools of resources.&lt;ref name="Blewitt-2015"/&gt; One of the first uses of the term sustainable in the contemporary sense was by the [[Club of Rome]] in 1972 in its classic report on the ''[[Limits to Growth]]'', written by a group of scientists led by [[Dennis Meadows|Dennis]] and [[Donella Meadows]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. Describing the desirable "state of global equilibrium", the authors wrote: "We are searching for a model output that represents a world system that is sustainable without sudden and uncontrolled collapse and capable of satisfying the basic material requirements of all of its people."&lt;ref name=Finn-2009/&gt;

Following the Club of Rome report, an MIT research group prepared ten days of hearings on "[http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/MIT/Growth%20and%20Its%20Implications.pdf Growth and Its Implication for the Future]" (Roundtable Press, 1973)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/MIT/Growth%20and%20Its%20Implications.pdf|title=Growth and its implications for the future|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the US Congress, the first hearings ever held on sustainable development.

Since the Brundtland Report, the concept of sustainable development has developed beyond the initial intergenerational framework to focus more on the goal of "socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic growth".&lt;ref name=Sachs-2015/&gt;{{RP|5}} In 1992, the [[UN Conference on Environment and Development]] published the [[Earth Charter]], which outlines the building of a just, sustainable, and peaceful global society in the 21st century. The action plan [[Agenda 21]] for sustainable development identified information, integration, and participation as key building blocks to help countries achieve development that recognises these interdependent pillars. It emphasises that in sustainable development everyone is a user and provider of information. It stresses the need to change from old sector-centered ways of doing business to new approaches that involve cross-sectoral co-ordination and the integration of environmental and social concerns into all development processes. Furthermore, Agenda 21 emphasises that broad public participation in decision making is a fundamental prerequisite for achieving sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;Will Allen. 2007.[http://learningforsustainability.net/susdev/ "Learning for Sustainability: Sustainable Development."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the principles of the [[United Nations Charter]] the [[United Nations Millennium Declaration|Millennium Declaration]] identified principles and treaties on sustainable development, including [[economic development]], [[Social change|social development]] and [[environmental protection]]. Broadly defined, sustainable development is a systems approach to growth and development and to manage natural, produced, and [[social capital]] for the welfare of their own and future generations. The term sustainable development as used by the United Nations incorporates both issues associated with [[land development]] and broader issues of [[Human development (humanity)|human development]] such as education, public health, and standard of living.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Sustainable development, or sustainability, has been described in terms of three spheres, dimensions, domains or pillars, i.e. the environment, the economy and society. The three-sphere framework was initially proposed by the economist René Passet in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4RFOAQAAIAAJ|title=L'Économique et le vivant|last=Passet|first=René|date=1979-01-01|publisher=Payot|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been worded as "economic, environmental and social" or "ecology, economy and equity".&lt;ref name="Global Sustainability Report"&gt;{{cite book|last=United Nations|title=Prototype Global Sustainable Development Report|publisher=United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Division for Sustainable Development|location=New York|date=2014|edition=Online unedited|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/globalsdreport/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been expanded by some authors to include a fourth pillar of culture, institutions or governance,&lt;ref name="Global Sustainability Report"/&gt; or alternatively reconfigured as four domains of the social - ecology, economics, politics and culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= with Magee | first2= Liam | last3= Scerri | first3= Andy | last4= Steger | first4= Manfred B. | title= Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice: Circles of Sustainability | url= https://www.academia.edu/9294719/Urban_Sustainability_in_Theory_and_Practice_Circles_of_Sustainability_2015_ | year= 2015 | publisher= Routledge | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus bringing economics back inside the social, and treating ecology as the intersection of the social and the natural.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citiesprogramme.com/archives/resource/circles-of-sustainability-urban-profile-process Circles of Sustainability Urban Profile Process] and {{Cite journal | year=2010 | first1= Andy |last1= Scerri | first2= Paul |  last2= James | authorlink2= Paul James (academic) | title= Accounting for sustainability: Combining qualitative and quantitative research in developing ‘indicators’ of sustainability | url= https://www.academia.edu/3230887/Accounting_for_Sustainability_Combining_Qualitative_and_Quantitative_Research_in_Developing_Indicators | journal= International Journal of Social Research Methodology | volume= 13 | issue= 1 | pages= 41–53 | doi=10.1080/13645570902864145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental sustainability concerns the [[natural environment]] and how it endures and remains diverse and productive. Since [[natural resources]] are derived from the environment, the state of air, water, and the climate are of particular concern. The [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] outlines current knowledge about scientific, technical and socio-economic information concerning [[climate change]], and lists options for [[Adaptation to global warming|adaptation]] and [[Climate change mitigation|mitigation]].&lt;ref name="Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental sustainability requires society to design activities to meet human needs while preserving the life support systems of the planet. This, for example, entails using water sustainably, utilizing renewable energy, and sustainable material supplies (e.g. harvesting wood from forests at a rate that maintains the biomass and biodiversity).{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

An unsustainable situation occurs when [[natural capital]] (the sum total of nature's resources) is used up faster than it can be replenished. Sustainability requires that human activity only uses nature's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally. Inherently the concept of sustainable development is intertwined with the concept of carrying capacity. Theoretically, the long-term result of [[environmental degradation]] is the inability to sustain human life.  Such degradation on a global scale should imply an increase in human death rate until population falls to what the degraded environment can support.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}  If the degradation continues beyond a certain [[Planetary boundaries|tipping point]] or critical threshold it would lead to eventual [[extinction]] for humanity.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Integral elements for a sustainable development are research and innovation activities. A telling example is the [[European environmental research and innovation policy]], which aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to achieve a truly sustainable development. Research and innovation in Europe is financially supported by the programme [[Horizon 2020]], which is also open to participation worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;See Horizon 2020 – the EU's new research and innovation programme http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-1085_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A promising direction towards sustainable development is to design systems that are flexible and reversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09613218.2012.702565|date=2012 | doi=10.1080/09613218.2012.702565 | volume=40 |title=Flexible strategies for long-term sustainability under uncertainty |journal=Building Research |pages=545–557 | last1 = Fawcett | first1 = William | last2 = Hughes | first2 = Martin | last3 = Krieg | first3 = Hannes | last4 = Albrecht | first4 = Stefan | last5 = Vennström | first5 = Anders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vladan_Babovic/publication/269694158_HYDRO-D-09-00078/links/54925b6a0cf2484a3f3e0c41.pdf |last=Zhang|first=S.X.|author2=V.

Pollution of the public resources is really not a different action, it just is a reverse tragedy of the commons, in that instead of taking something out, something is put into the commons.  When the costs of polluting the commons are not calculated into the cost of the items consumed, then it becomes only natural to pollute, as the cost of pollution is external to the cost of the goods produced and the cost of cleaning the waste before it is discharged exceeds the cost of releasing the waste directly into the commons.  So, the only way to solve this problem is by protecting the ecology of the commons by making it, through taxes or fines, more costly to release the waste directly into the commons than would be the cost of cleaning the waste before discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economics, Ecology, Ethics: Essays toward a Steady-State Economy|last=Daly|first=H. E.|publisher=W. H. Freeman and Company|others=Hardin, G. "The tragedy of the commons"|year=|isbn=|location=New York and San Francisco|pages=100–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So, one can try to appeal to the ethics of the situation by doing the right thing as an individual, but in the absence of any direct consequences, the individual will tend to do what is best for the person and not what is best for the common good of the public.  Once again, this issue needs to be addressed.  Because, left unaddressed, the development of the commonly owned property will become impossible to achieve in a sustainable way.  So, this topic is central to the understanding of creating a sustainable situation from the management of the public resources that are used for personal use.

====Agriculture====
{{See also|Sustainable agriculture}}
Sustainable agriculture consists of [[environment friendly]] methods of farming that allow the production of crops or livestock without damage to human or natural systems. It involves preventing adverse effects to soil, water, biodiversity, surrounding or downstream resources—as well as to those working or living on the farm or in neighboring areas. The concept of sustainable agriculture extends intergenerationally, passing on a conserved or improved natural resource, biotic, and economic base rather than one which has been depleted or polluted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Networld-Project |url=http://www.green-networld.com/facts/glossary.htm |title=Environmental Glossary |publisher=Green-networld.com |date=1998-02-09 |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of sustainable agriculture include [[permaculture]], [[agroforestry]], [[mixed farming]], [[multiple cropping]], and [[crop rotation]].&lt;ref&gt;Ben Falk, ''The resilient farm and homestead: An innovative permaculture and whole systems design approach''.

According to ecological economist [[:de:Malte Michael Faber|Malte Faber]], ecological economics is defined by its focus on nature, justice, and time. Issues of [[intergenerational equity]], [[irreversibility]] of environmental change, [[uncertainty]] of long-term outcomes, and sustainable development guide ecological economic analysis and valuation.&lt;ref name=Faber2008&gt;Malte Faber.

As early as the 1970s, the concept of sustainability was used to describe an [[economy]] "in equilibrium with basic ecological support systems".&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert L. Stivers|Stivers, R.]] 1976.

A [[World Bank]] study from 1999 concluded that based on the theory of genuine savings, policymakers have many possible interventions to increase sustainability, in [[macroeconomics]] or purely environmental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hamilton |first=K. |first2=M. |last2=Clemens |year=1999 |title=Genuine savings rates in developing countries |journal=World Bank Economy Review |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=333–356 |doi=10.1093/wber/13.2.333 | url=http://wber.oxfordjournals.org/content/13/2/333.abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have noted that efficient policies for renewable energy and pollution are compatible with increasing human welfare, eventually reaching a golden-rule steady state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2001 |first=A.

The study, ''Interpreting Sustainability in Economic Terms'', found three pillars of sustainable development, interlinkage, [[intergenerational equity]], and [[dynamic efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stavins |first=R. |first2=A. |last2=Wagner |first3=G. |last3=Wagner |title=Interpreting Sustainability in Economic Terms: Dynamic Efficiency Plus Intergenerational Equity |journal=[[Economic Letters]] |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=339–343 |doi=10.1016/S0165-1765(03)00036-3 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But [[Gilbert Rist]] points out that the World Bank has twisted the notion of sustainable development to prove that economic development need not be deterred in the interest of preserving the ecosystem. He writes: "From this angle, 'sustainable development' looks like a cover-up operation. ... The thing that is meant to be sustained is really 'development', not the tolerance capacity of the ecosystem or of human societies."&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Development'', 3rd Ed. (New York: Zed, 2008) 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Bank, a leading producer of environmental knowledge, continues to advocate the win-win prospects for economic growth and ecological stability even as its economists express their doubts.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel P. Castillo, "Integral Ecology as a Liberationist Concept" in ''Theological Studies'', Vol 77, 2, June 2016, 374.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herman Daly]], an economist for the Bank from 1988 to 1994, writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When authors of ''WDR'' '92 [the highly influential 1992 ''World Development Report'' that featured the environment] were drafting the report, they called me asking for examples of "win-win" strategies in my work. What could I say? None exists in that pure form; there are trade-offs, not "win-wins." But they want to see a world of "win-wins" based on articles of faith, not fact. I wanted to contribute because ''WDR''s are important in the Bank, [because] task managers read [them] to find philosophical justification for their latest round of projects. But they did not want to hear about how things really are, or what I find in my work..."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Goldman, ''Imperial Nature: the World Bank and the Struggle for Justice in the Age of Globalization.'' (New Haven: Yale University, 2005), 128, quoted in ''[[Theological Studies (journal)|Theological Studies]]'', supra.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Environmental economics ====
{{main|Environmental economics}}
The total environment includes not just the biosphere of earth, air, and water, but also human interactions with these things, with nature, and what humans have created as their surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Economics, 3rd Edition. J.J. Seneca/M.K. Taussig. 1984. Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

As countries around the world continue to advance economically, they put a strain on the ability of the natural environment to absorb the high level of pollutants that are created as a part of this economic growth. Therefore, solutions need to be found so that the economies of the world can continue to grow, but not at the expense of the public good.  In the world of economics the amount of environmental quality must be considered as limited in supply and therefore is treated as a scarce resource. This is a resource to be protected. One common way to analyze possible outcomes of policy decisions on the scarce resource is to do a cost-benefit analysis. This type of analysis contrasts different options of resource allocation and, based on an evaluation of the expected courses of action and the consequences of these actions, the optimal way to do so in the light of different policy goals can be elicited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barbier|first1=E.B.|last2=Markandya|first2=A.|last3=Pearce|first3=D.W.|title=Environmental sustainability and cost-benefit analysis|journal=Environment and Planning A|date=1990|volume=22|doi=10.1068/a221259|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.335.1749&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|accessdate=11 November 2016|pages=1259–1266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benefit-cost analysis basically can look at several ways of solving a problem and then assigning the best route for a solution, based on the set of consequences that would result from the further development of the individual courses of action, and then choosing the course of action that results in the least amount of damage to the expected outcome for the environmental quality that remains after that development or process takes place. Further complicating this analysis are the interrelationships of the various parts of the environment that might be impacted by the chosen course of action.  Sometimes it is almost impossible to predict the various outcomes of a course of action, due to the unexpected consequences and the amount of unknowns that are not accounted for in the benefit-cost analysis.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

====Energy====
{{Main|Smart grid|Sustainable energy}}
Sustainable energy is clean and can be used over a long period of time. Unlike fossil fuels and biofuels that provide the bulk of the worlds energy, [[renewable energy]] sources like hydroelectric, solar and wind energy produce far less pollution.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-biofuels-idUSBRE90601A20130107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fainstein, Susan S. 2000.

These communities are historically left out during the decision-making process, and often end up with dirty power plants and other dirty energy projects that poison the air and harm the area. These toxicants are major contributors to health problems in the communities. As renewable energy becomes more common, fossil fuel infrastructures are replaced by renewables, providing better social equity to these communities.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Scott. 1996. "Green Cities, Growing Cities, Just Cities?: Urban planning and the Contradictions of Sustainable Development," Journal of the American Planning Association&lt;/ref&gt;
Overall, and in the long run, sustainable development in the field of energy is also deemed to contribute to economic sustainability and national security of communities, thus being increasingly encouraged through investment policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|title=Sustainable Energy Investments and National Security: Arbitration and Negotiation Issues|journal=JOURNAL OF WORLD ENERGY LAW AND BUSINESS|date=2015|volume=8|issue=6|ssrn=2695579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Technology====
{{See also|Appropriate technology|Environmental engineering|Environmental technology}}
One of the core concepts in sustainable development is that technology can be used to assist people meet their developmental needs. Technology to meet these sustainable development needs is often referred to as [[appropriate technology]], which is an ideological movement (and its manifestations) originally articulated as [[intermediate technology]] by the economist [[E. F. Schumacher]] in his influential work, ''[[Small is Beautiful]].'' and now covers a wide range of technologies.&lt;ref name=BrownU&gt;{{cite book|title=Appropriate Technology: Tools, Choices, and Implications|year=1999|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|isbn=0-12-335190-1|pages=3, 270|author=Hazeltine, B.|author2=Bull, C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Schumacher and many modern-day proponents of appropriate technology also emphasise the technology as people-centered.&lt;ref name=Akubue&gt;{{cite journal|last=Akubue|first=Anthony|title=Appropriate Technology for Socioeconomic Development in Third World Countries|journal=The Journal of Technology Studies|date=Winter–Spring 2000|volume=26|issue=1|pages=33–43.Retrieved March 2011|url=http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/JOTS/Winter-Spring-2000/akabue.html|doi=10.21061/jots.v26i1.a.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today appropriate technology is often developed using [[open source]] principles, which have led to [[open-source appropriate technology]] (OSAT) and thus many of the plans of the technology can be freely found on the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pearce | first1 = Joshua M. | year = 2012 | title = The Case for Open Source Appropriate Technology | url =https://www.academia.edu/1517361/The_Case_for_Open_Source_Appropriate_Technology | journal = Environment, Development and Sustainability | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 425–431 | doi = 10.1007/s10668-012-9337-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; OSAT has been proposed as a new model of enabling [[innovation]] for sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce J., Albritton S., Grant G., Steed G., &amp; Zelenika I. 2012.

====Transport====
{{See also|Sustainable transport}}
Transportation is a large contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. It is said that one-third of all gasses produced are due to transportation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sustainable Transport in Freiburg: Lessons from Germany's Environmental Capital|last = Buehler|first = Ralph|date = 2011|journal = International Journal of Sustainable Transportation&lt;!-- 23:04:16--&gt;|doi = 10.1080/15568311003650531|pmid = |last2 = Pucher|first2 = John|volume=5|pages=43–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motorized transport also releases exhaust fumes that contain particulate matter which is hazardous to human health and a contributor to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-breathe-clean/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Breathe clean|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainable transport has many social and economic benefits that can accelerate local sustainable development. According to a series of reports by the [[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]], sustainable transport can help create jobs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-create-jobs/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Create jobs|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; improve commuter safety through investment in bicycle lanes and pedestrian pathways,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-make-roads-safe/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Make roads safe|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; make access to employment and social opportunities more affordable and efficient. It also offers a practical opportunity to save people's time and household income as well as government budgets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-save-time-money/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Save money and time|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; making investment in sustainable transport a 'win-win' opportunity.

Some Western countries are making transportation more sustainable in both long-term and short-term implementations.&lt;ref&gt;Barbour, Elissa and Elizabeth A. Deakin. 2012. "Smart Growth Planning for Climate Protection"&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the modification in available transportation in [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg, Germany]]. The city has implemented extensive methods of public transportation, cycling, and walking, along with large areas where cars are not allowed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since many Western countries are highly automobile-oriented, the main transit that people use is personal vehicles. About 80% of their travel involves cars.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Therefore, California, is one of the highest [[greenhouse gases]] emitters in the United States. The federal government has to come up with some plans to reduce the total number of vehicle trips in order to lower greenhouse gases emission. Such as:

* Improve public transit through the provision of larger coverage area in order to provide more mobility and accessibility, new technology to provide a more reliable and responsive public transportation network.&lt;ref&gt;Murthy, A.S. Narasimha Mohle, Henry. [http://site.ebrary.com/lib/alltitles/docDetail.action?docID=10447877&amp;p00=transportation%20improvement Transportation Engineering Basics (2nd Edition)]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. (American Society of Civil Engineers 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Encourage walking and biking through the provision of wider pedestrian pathway, bike share stations in downtowns, locate parking lots far from the shopping center, limit on street parking, slower traffic lane in downtown area.
* Increase the cost of car ownership and gas taxes through increased parking fees and tolls, encouraging people to drive more fuel efficient vehicles. This can produce a social equity problem, since lower income people usually drive older vehicles with lower fuel efficiency. Government can use the extra revenue collected from taxes and tolls to improve public transportation and benefit poor communities.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Jonathan. 2013. "Urban Transportation and Social Equity: Transportation Planning Paradigms that Impede Policy Reform," in Naomi Carmon and Susan S. Fainstein, eds. Policy, Planning and people: promoting Justice in Urban Development (Penn)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other states and nations have built efforts to [[knowledge translation|translate knowledge]] in [[behavioral economics]] into [[evidence-based]] [[sustainable transportation]] policies.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

====Business====

{{See also|Corporate sustainability}}
The most broadly accepted criterion for corporate sustainability constitutes a firm's efficient use of natural capital.  This [[eco-efficiency]] is usually calculated as the economic value added by a firm in relation to its aggregated ecological impact.&lt;ref&gt;Schaltegger, S. &amp; Sturm, A. 1998. Eco-Efficiency by Eco-Controlling. Zürich: vdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  This idea has been popularised by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development ([[WBCSD]]) under the following definition: "Eco-efficiency is achieved by the delivery of competitively priced goods and services that satisfy human needs and bring quality of life, while progressively reducing ecological impacts and [[resource intensity]] throughout the life-cycle to a level at least in line with the earth's carrying capacity" (DeSimone and Popoff, 1997: 47).&lt;ref&gt;DeSimone, L. &amp; Popoff, F. 1997. Eco-efficiency: The business link to sustainable development. Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the eco-efficiency concept but so far less explored is the second criterion for corporate sustainability. Socio-efficiency&lt;ref name="Dyllick, T. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dyllick | first1 = T. | last2 = Hockerts | first2 = K. | year = 2002 | title = Beyond the business case for corporate sustainability | url = | journal = Business Strategy and the Environment | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 130–141 | doi=10.1002/bse.323}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the relation between a firm's value added and its social impact. Whereas, it can be assumed that most corporate impacts on the environment are negative (apart from rare exceptions such as the planting of trees) this is not true for social impacts. These can be either positive (e.g. corporate giving, creation of employment) or negative (e.g. work accidents, mobbing of employees, human rights abuses). Depending on the type of impact socio-efficiency thus either tries to minimise negative social impacts (i.e. accidents per value added) or maximise positive social impacts (i.e. donations per value added) in relation to the value added.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Both eco-efficiency and socio-efficiency are concerned primarily with increasing economic sustainability. In this process they instrumentalise both natural and social capital aiming to benefit from win-win situations. However, as Dyllick and Hockerts&lt;ref name="Dyllick, T. 2002"/&gt; point out the business case alone will not be sufficient to realise sustainable development. They point towards eco-effectiveness, socio-effectiveness, sufficiency, and eco-equity as four criteria that need to be met if sustainable development is to be reached.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

CASI Global, New York "CSR &amp; Sustainability together lead to sustainable development. CSR as in corporate social responsibility is not what you do with your profits, but is the way you make profits. This means CSR is a part of every department of the company value chain and not a part of HR / independent department. Sustainability as in effects towards Human resources, Environment and Ecology has to be measured within each department of the company." http://casiglobal.us/

====Income====

At the present time, sustainable development can reduce [[poverty]]. Sustainable development reduces [[poverty]] through financial (among other things, a balanced budget), environmental (living conditions), and social (including equality of income) means.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wydawnictwoumk.pl/czasopisma/index.php/CJFA/article/view/CJFA.2014.001/3213 S.

====Architecture====

{{See also|Sustainable architecture}}
In sustainable architecture the recent movements of [[New Urbanism]] and [[New Classical architecture]] promote a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops [[smart growth]], [[Vernacular architecture|architectural tradition]] and [[Classical architecture|classical design]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnu.org/charter Charter of the New Urbanism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty, Humanism, Continuity between Past and Future|url=http://www.traditionalarchitecture.co.uk/aims.html|publisher=Traditional Architecture Group|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in contrast to [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] architecture, as well as opposing to solitary [[housing estate]]s and [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]], with long commuting distances and large ecological footprints.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aia.org/SiteObjects/files/smartgrowth05.pdf Issue Brief: Smart-Growth: Building Livable Communities]. American Institute of Architects. Retrieved on 2014-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Both trends started in the 1980s. (It should be noted that sustainable architecture is predominantly relevant to the economics domain while architectural landscaping pertains more to the ecological domain.){{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Politics===
{{See also|Environmental politics|Environmental governance|Sustainability metrics and indices}}
A study concluded that social indicators and, therefore, sustainable development indicators, are scientific constructs whose principal objective is to inform public policy-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul-Marie Boulanger |url=http://sapiens.revues.org/index166.html |title=Sustainable development indicators: a scientific challenge, a democratic issue. '&amp;#39;S.A.P.I.EN.S.'&amp;#39; '&amp;#39;'1'&amp;#39;' (1) |publisher=Sapiens.revues.org |year=2008 |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] has similarly developed a political policy framework, linked to a sustainability index for establishing measurable entities and metrics. The framework consists of six core areas, international trade and investment, economic policy, climate change and energy, measurement and assessment, natural resource management, and the role of communication technologies in sustainable development.

The [[United Nations Global Compact]] Cities Programme has defined sustainable political development in a way that broadens the usual definition beyond states and governance. The political is defined as the domain of practices and meanings associated with basic issues of social power as they pertain to the organisation, authorisation, legitimation and regulation of a social life held in common. This definition is in accord with the view that political change is important for responding to economic, ecological and cultural challenges. It also means that the politics of economic change can be addressed. They have listed seven subdomains of the domain of politics:&lt;ref name="citiesprogramme.com"/&gt;

#Organization and governance
#Law and justice
#Communication and critique
#Representation and negotiation
#Security and accord
#Dialogue and reconciliation
#Ethics and accountability

This accords with the Brundtland Commission emphasis on development that is guided by human rights principles (see above).

[[File:Circles of Sustainability image (assessment - Melbourne 2011).jpg|250px|thumb|Framing of sustainable development progress according to the [[Circles of Sustainability]], used by the [[United Nations Global Compact|United Nations]].]]
Working with a different emphasis, some researchers and institutions have pointed out that a fourth dimension should be added to the dimensions of sustainable development, since the triple-bottom-line dimensions of economic, environmental and social do not seem to be enough to reflect the complexity of contemporary society. In this context, the [[Agenda 21 for culture]] and the [[United Cities and Local Governments]] (UCLG)  Executive Bureau lead the preparation of the policy statement "Culture: Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development", passed on 17 November 2010, in the framework of the World Summit of Local and Regional Leaders&amp;nbsp;– 3rd World Congress of UCLG, held in Mexico City. This document inaugurates a new perspective and points to the relation between culture and sustainable development through a dual approach: developing a solid [[cultural policy]] and advocating a cultural dimension in all public policies. The [[Circles of Sustainability]] approach distinguishes the four domains of economic, ecological, political and cultural sustainability.&lt;ref name="agenda21culture.net"&gt;United Cities and Local Governments, [http://agenda21culture.net/index.php/16-official-documentation-all/agenda-21-culture-all/437-cultural-policies-and-sustainable-development "Culture: Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uclg.org/en/node/21824&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/15885475/Assessing_Cultural_Sustainability_Agenda_21_for_Culture&lt;/ref&gt;

Other organizations have also supported the idea of a fourth domain of sustainable development. The Network of Excellence "Sustainable Development in a Diverse World",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.susdiv.org/ |title=Sus.Div |publisher=Sus.Div |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; sponsored by the [[European Union]], integrates multidisciplinary capacities and interprets [[cultural diversity]] as a key element of a new strategy for sustainable development. The Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development Theory has been referenced by executive director of IMI Institute at [[UNESCO]] Vito Di Bari&lt;ref&gt;"Agreement between UNESCO and the City of Milan concerning the International Multimedia Institute (IMI) - Appointment of Executive Director&amp;nbsp;— UNESCO Archives ICA AtoM catalogue". Atom.archives.unesco.org. 1999-10-08. Retrieved 2014-01-17.&lt;/ref&gt; in his manifesto of art and architectural movement [[Neo-Futurism]], whose name was inspired by the 1987 [[United Nations]]’ report [[Our Common Future]]. The [[Circles of Sustainability]] approach used by Metropolis defines the (fourth) cultural domain as practices, discourses, and material expressions, which, over time, express continuities and discontinuities of social meaning.&lt;ref name="citiesprogramme.com"&gt;http://citiesprogramme.com/archives/resource/circles-of-sustainability-urban-profile-process {{Cite journal

===Progress===
{{See also|Sustainable development goals}}
The [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]] (UNCSD; also known as Rio 2012) was the third international conference on sustainable development,  which aimed at reconciling the economic and environmental goals of the global community. An outcome of this conference was the development of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] that aim to promote sustainable progress and eliminate inequalities around the world. However, few nations met the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]]'s definition of sustainable development criteria established in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Living Planet Report 2006 |url= http://assets.panda.org/downloads/living_planet_report.pdf |publisher= [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], [[Zoological Society of London]], [[Global Footprint Network]] |date= 24 October 2006 |page= 19 |accessdate= 18 August 2012 }}; [http://www.science.org.au/nova/newscientist/107ns_004.htm World failing on sustainable development] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209164418/http://www.science.org.au/nova/newscientist/107ns_004.htm |date=9 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some nations are more developed than others, all nations are constantly developing because each nation struggles with perpetuating disparities, inequalities and unequal access to fundamental rights and freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Creating Capabilities: The Human Development Approach|last = Nussbaum|first = Martha|publisher = The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-674-05054-9|location = Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England|pages = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measurement===
{{Main|Ecological footprint|Sustainability measurement}}
[[File:Amazonie deforestation.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Deforestation and increased road-building in the [[Amazon Rainforest]] are a concern because of increased human encroachment upon [[wilderness]] areas, increased resource extraction and further threats to [[biodiversity]].]]
In 2007 a report for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency stated: "While much discussion and effort has gone into sustainability indicators, none of the resulting systems clearly tells us whether our society is sustainable. At best, they can tell us that we are heading in the wrong direction, or that our current activities are not sustainable. More often, they simply draw our attention to the existence of problems, doing little to tell us the origin of those problems and nothing to tell us how to solve them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/1841126/Environmental-Protection-Agency-hechtepaordpaper |title=Joy E. Hecht, Can Indicators and Accounts Really Measure Sustainability? Considerations for the U.S. Environmental Protection |access-date=15 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410172521/http://www.scribd.com/doc/1841126/Environmental-Protection-Agency-hechtepaordpaper |archive-date=10 April 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, a majority of authors assume that a set of well defined and harmonised indicators is the only way to make sustainability tangible. Those indicators are expected to be identified and adjusted through empirical observations (trial and error).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2006 | title = An adaptive learning process for developing and applying sustainability indicators with local communities | url = http://km.fao.org/uploads/media/An%20adaptative%20learning%20process%20for%20developing%20and%20applying%20sustainability%20indicators%20with%20local%20communities.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Ecological economics | volume = 59 | issue =  | pages = 406–418 | doi = 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.11.008 | last1 = Reed | first1 = Mark S. | access-date = 18 February 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110726045818/http://km.fao.org/uploads/media/An%20adaptative%20learning%20process%20for%20developing%20and%20applying%20sustainability%20indicators%20with%20local%20communities.pdf | archive-date = 26 July 2011 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common critiques are related to issues like data quality, comparability, objective function and the necessary resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nse-netz.de/downloads/nachh.pdf |title=Annette Lang, Ist Nachhaltigkeit messbar?, Uni Hannover, 2003 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110802135133/http://www.nse-netz.de/downloads/nachh.pdf |archive-date=2 August 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However a more general criticism is coming from the project management community: How can a sustainable development be achieved at global level if we cannot monitor it in any single project?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://youth-partnership-eu.coe.int/youth-partnership/documents/Publications/T_kits/3/tkit3.pdf |title=Project Management T-kit, Council of Europe and European Commission, Strasbourg, 2000 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grida.no/publications/et/ep4/page/2653.aspx |title=Do global targets matter?, The Environment Times, Poverty Times #4, UNEP/GRID-Arendal, 2010 |publisher=Grida.no |accessdate=2011-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629043039/http://www.grida.no/publications/et/ep4/page/2653.aspx |archive-date=29 June 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cuban-born researcher and entrepreneur Sonia Bueno suggests an alternative approach that is based upon the integral, long-term cost-benefit relationship as a measure and monitoring tool for the sustainability of every project, activity or enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.empai-matanzas.co.cu/revista/REVISTA_archivos/Page969.htm |title=Sostenibilidad en la construcción.

Reasonable qualifications of sustainability are seen U.S. Green Building Council's (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). This design incorporates some ecological, economic, and social elements. The goals presented by LEED design goals are sustainable sites, water efficiency, energy and atmospheric emission reduction, material and resources efficiency, and indoor environmental quality. Although amount of structures for sustainability development is many, these qualification has become a standard for sustainable building.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Recent research efforts created also the [[SDEWES Centre#SDEWES Index|SDEWES Index]] to benchmark the performance of cities across aspects that are related to energy, water and environment systems. The [[SDEWES Centre|SDEWES]] Index consists of 7 dimensions, 35 indicators, and close to 20 sub-indicators. It is currently applied to 58 cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SDEWES Centre - SDEWES Index|url = http://www.sdewes.org/sdewes_index.php|website = www.sdewes.org|accessdate = 2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural capital===
[[File:Hillside deforestation in Rio de Janeiro.jpg|300px|thumb|alt=Deforastation of native rain forest in Rio de Janeiro City for extraction of clay for civil construction|[[Deforestation]] of native [[rain forest]] in Rio de Janeiro City for extraction of [[clay]] for [[civil engineering]] (2009 picture).]]
The sustainable development debate is based on the assumption that societies need to manage three types of capital (economic, social, and natural), which may be non-substitutable and whose consumption might be irreversible.&lt;ref name="Dyllick, T. 2002"/&gt; Leading [[Ecological economics|ecological economist]] and [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]],&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt; for example, points to the fact that [[natural capital]] can not necessarily be substituted by economic capital. While it is possible that we can find ways to replace some natural resources, it is much more unlikely that they will ever be able to replace eco-system services, such as the protection provided by the ozone layer, or the climate stabilizing function of the Amazonian forest. In fact natural capital, social capital and economic capital are often complementarities. A further obstacle to substitutability lies also in the multi-functionality of many natural resources. Forests, for example, not only provide the raw material for paper (which can be substituted quite easily), but they also maintain biodiversity, regulate water flow, and absorb CO2.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Another problem of natural and social capital deterioration lies in their partial irreversibility. The [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], for example, is often definitive. The same can be true for cultural diversity. For example, with globalisation advancing quickly the number of indigenous languages is dropping at alarming rates.  Moreover, the depletion of natural and social capital may have non-linear consequences. Consumption of natural and social capital may have no observable impact until a certain threshold is reached. A lake can, for example, absorb nutrients for a long time while actually increasing its productivity. However, once a certain level of algae is reached lack of oxygen causes the lake's ecosystem to break down suddenly.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Business-as-usual===
[[File:Air pollution by industrial chimneys.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Before [[flue-gas desulfurization]] was installed, the [[air pollution|air-polluting]] emissions from this power plant in [[New Mexico]] contained excessive amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]].]]
If the degradation of natural and social capital has such important consequence the question arises why action is not taken more systematically to alleviate it. Cohen and Winn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cohen | first1 = B. | last2 = Winn | first2 = M. I. | year = 2007 | title = Market imperfections, opportunity and sustainable entrepreneurship | url = | journal = Journal of Business Venturing | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 29–49 | doi=10.1016/j.jbusvent.2004.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; point to four types of market failure as possible explanations: First, while the benefits of natural or social capital depletion can usually be privatised, the costs are often externalised (i.e. they are borne not by the party responsible but by society in general). Second, natural capital is often undervalued by society since we are not fully aware of the real cost of the depletion of natural capital. Information asymmetry is a third reason—often the link between cause and effect is obscured, making it difficult for actors to make informed choices. Cohen and Winn close with the realization that contrary to economic theory many firms are not perfect optimisers. They postulate that firms often do not optimise resource allocation because they are caught in a "business as usual" mentality.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Education===
''Main page: [[Education for sustainable development]]''

Education must be revisited in light of a renewed vision of sustainable human and social development that is both equitable and viable. This vision of sustainability must take into consideration the social, environmental and economic dimensions of human development and the various ways in which these relate to education: ‘An empowering education is one that builds the human resources we need to be productive, to continue to learn, to solve problems, to be creative, and to live together and with nature in peace and harmony. When nations ensure that such an education is accessible to all throughout their lives, a quiet revolution is set in motion: education becomes the engine of sustainable development and the key to a better world.’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Power of Education: Education for All, Development, Globalisation and UNESCO|last=Power|first=C|publisher=London, Springer|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232555e.pdf|title=Rethinking Education: Towards a global common good?|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100088-1|location=|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher education in sustainability across education streams including engineering, finance, supply chain and operations is gaining weight-age. Multiple institutes including Wharton, Columbia, CASI Global New York offer certifications in Sustainability.
Corporate's prefer employees certified in sustainability.

== Insubstantial stretching of the term ==
It has been argued that since the 1960s, the concept of sustainable development has changed from "conservation management" to "economic development", whereby the original meaning of the concept has been stretched somewhat.&lt;ref name=to01&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Riordan |first=Timothy |date=1993 |chapter=The Politics of Sustainability |editor-last=Turner |editor-first=R. Kerry |title=Sustainable Environmental Economics and Management: Principles and Practice. |location=London |publisher=Belhaven Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|48–54}}

In the 1960s, the international community realised that many African countries needed national plans to safeguard wildlife habitats, and that rural areas had to confront the limits imposed by soil, climate and water availability. This was a strategy of conservation management. In the 1970s, however, the focus shifted to the broader issues of the provisioning of basic human needs, community participation as well as appropriate technology use throughout the developing countries (and not just in Africa). This was a strategy of economic development, and the strategy was carried even further by the [[Brundtland Commission]]'s report on ''[[Our Common Future]]'' when the issues went from regional to international in scope and application.&lt;ref name=to01/&gt;{{rp|48–54}} In effect, the conservationists were crowded out and superseded by the developers.

But shifting the focus of sustainable development from conservation to development has had the imperceptible effect of stretching the original forest management term of [[sustainable yield]] from the use of renewable resources only (like forestry), to now also accounting for the use of non-renewable resources (like [[Natural resource#Classification|minerals]]).&lt;ref name=kt01&gt;{{cite book |last=Turner |first=R. Kerry |date=1988 |chapter=Sustainability, Resource Conservation and Pollution Control: An Overview |editor-last=Turner |editor-first=R. Kerry |title=Sustainable Environmental Management. |location=London |publisher=Belhaven Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}} This stretching of the term has been questioned. Thus, environmental economist Kerry Turner has argued that literally, there can be no such thing as overall "sustainable development" in an industrialised [[world economy]] that remains heavily dependent on the extraction of earth's finite stock of exhaustible mineral resources: "It makes no sense to talk about the sustainable use of a non-renewable resource (even with substantial [[recycling]] effort and use rates). Any positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to exhaustion of the finite stock."&lt;ref name=kt01/&gt;{{rp|13}}

In effect, it has been argued that the industrial revolution as a whole is unsustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Georgescu-Roegen |first=Nicholas |authorlink=Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen |date=1971 |title=The Entropy Law and the Economic Process |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/267519123/The-Entropy-Law-and-the-Economic-Process-by-Nicholas-Georgescu-Roegen-pdf |format=Full book accessible at Scribd |location=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0674257804 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20f}}&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|22f}}&lt;ref name=jr01&gt;{{cite book |last=Rifkin |first=Jeremy |authorlink=Jeremy Rifkin |date=1980 |title=Entropy: A New World View. |url=http://www.foet.org/FOET-data/uploads/2017/03/Jeremy-Rifkin-Entropy-table-of-contents.pdf |format=PDF contains only the title and contents pages of the book |location=New York |publisher=The Viking Press |isbn=0670297178 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61–67}}&lt;ref name="Monbiot-20171124"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Monbiot|first1=George|title=Everything Must Go|url=http://www.monbiot.com/2017/11/24/everything-must-go/|website=George Monbiot|accessdate=26 November 2017|date=2017-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One critic has argued that the [[Brundtland Commission]] promoted nothing but a business as usual strategy for world development, with the ambiguous and insubstantial concept of "sustainable development" attached as a public relations slogan:&lt;ref name=ap01&gt;{{cite book |last=Perez-Carmona |first=Alexander |date=2013 |chapter=Growth: A Discussion of the Margins of Economic and Ecological Thought |chapter-url=http://www.slideshare.net/lucieevers1/growth-in-margin-of-ecological-thought-by-perez |editor-last=Meuleman |editor-first=Louis |title=Transgovernance. Advancing Sustainability Governance. |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-28009-2_3 |chapter-format=Article accessible at SlideShare |location=Heidelberg |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783642280085 |pages=83–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|94–99}} The report on ''[[Our Common Future]]'' was largely the result of a political bargaining process involving many special interest groups, all put together to create a common appeal of political acceptability across borders. After World War II, the notion of "development" had been established in the West to imply the projection of the American model of society onto the rest of the world. In the 1970s and 1980s, this notion was broadened somewhat to also imply human rights, basic human needs and finally, ecological issues. The emphasis of the report was on helping poor nations out of poverty and meeting the basic needs of their growing populations—as usual. This issue demanded more economic growth, also in the rich countries, who would then import more goods from the poor countries to help them out—as usual. When the discussion switched to [[Steady-state economy#Present background: Exceeding global limits to growth|global ecological limits to growth]], the obvious dilemma was left aside by calling for economic growth with improved resource efficiency, or what was termed "a change in the ''quality'' of growth". However, most countries in the West had experienced such improved resource efficiency since the early-20th century already and as usual; only, this improvement had been more than offset by continuing industrial expansion, to the effect that world resource consumption was now higher than ever before—and these two historical trends were completely ignored in the report. Taken together, the policy of perpetual economic growth for the entire planet remained virtually intact. Since the publication of the report, the ambiguous and insubstantial slogan of "sustainable development" has marched on worldwide.&lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|94–99}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10549">A '''sustainable development reserve''' ({{lang-pt|Reserva de Desenvolvimento Sustentável}}, RDS) in Brazil is a type of [[Protected areas of Brazil|protected area]] inhabited by a traditional population that seeks to preserve nature while maintaining and improving the life of the population through [[sustainable development]].

==Background==

The concept of Sustainable Development Reserves originated in the Projeto Mamirauá launched in the early 1990s by the Sociedade Civil Mamirauá.
The project followed the principle of management based on scientific research and controlled use of natural resources.
The local population participates actively in the planning process and in responsible for managing and monitoring the area.
Key aspects are that the strategy can adapt to changes in the market, private property is maintained, plans are implemented to improve living conditions, and the local people partner with government agencies and NGOs to develop proposals for sustainable use.{{sfn|Reservas de Desenvolvimento Sustentável – Sociedade Civil Mamirauá}}

The [[Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve]] was established in 1996, the first such reserve in Brazil.{{sfn|Reservas de Desenvolvimento Sustentável – Sociedade Civil Mamirauá}}
The adjacent [[Amanã Sustainable Development Reserve]] was established in 1998 after the successful implementation of the Mamirauá reserve, and was fully supported by the local people.
They already recognized the importance of preserving the vegetation and animals that they depend upon for their livelihood.{{sfn|Luiz Claudio Marigo|1999}}
The new category of protected area was included in the National Protected Areas System (SNUG), which defined types of [[Protected areas of Brazil|protected area of Brazil]] in 2000.{{sfn|Reservas de Desenvolvimento Sustentável – Sociedade Civil Mamirauá}}

==Structure==

A Sustainable Development Reserve (RDS) holds traditional populations that live by sustainable exploitation of natural resources, developed over generations and adapted to the local ecology, and that protect nature and maintain biological diversity.
The goals are to preserve nature while preserving and improving the quality of life of the traditional populations, and to advance scientific knowledge and understanding of traditional techniques for managing the environment.{{sfn|Reserva de Desenvolvimento Sustentáve – ISA}}

The land in an RDS is in the public domain, and may be expropriated.
Land use is regulated according to Law 9985 article 23 (2000) and in specific regulations.
A board of directors is chaired by the administrative agency and includes representatives of public bodies, civil society organizations and traditional populations living in the area.{{sfn|Reserva de Desenvolvimento Sustentáve – ISA}}
A management plan is created by the administrative agency, which recognises the dynamic balance between conservation goals and the size of the population.
Natural ecosystems may be exploited sustainably, and cultivation of introduced species is allowed, subject to the management plan.
The plan defines areas where the ecology is fully protected, buffer zones, zones of sustainable use and ecological corridors.
Public visits to the RDS are allowed and encouraged where compatible with local interests and the management plan.
Scientific research and education with focus on conservation of nature are also encouraged.{{sfn|Reserva de Desenvolvimento Sustentáve – ISA}}

[[File:Congres Team 10 in Otterlo - Team 10 Meeting in Otterlo.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Otterlo]] Meeting 1959 (also CIAM '59), organized by Team 10, 43 participants. Meeting place: [[Kröller-Müller Museum]], located in the [[Hoge Veluwe National Park]]. Dissolution of the organization CIAM.]]
'''Team 10''' — just as often referred to as '''Team X''' or '''Team Ten''' — was a group of architects and other invited participants who assembled starting in July 1953 at the 9th Congress of the [[Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne|International Congresses of Modern Architecture (CIAM)]] and created a schism within CIAM by challenging its doctrinaire approach to [[urbanism]].

==Membership==
The group's first formal meeting under the name of Team 10 took place in [[Bagnols-sur-Cèze]] in 1960. The last, with only four members present, was in Lisbon in 1981.

Team 10's core group consists of [[Pancho Guedes]], Rolf Gutmann, [[Geir Grung (architect)|Geir Grung]], Oskar Hansen,&lt;ref&gt;Stanek, L. ed., Team 10 East. Revisionist Architecture in Real Existing Modernism (Warsaw: Museum of Modern Art/ Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reima Pietilä]], Charles Polonyi, Brian Richards, [[Jerzy Soltan]], [[Oswald Mathias Ungers]], [[John Voelcker]], and Stefan Wewerka.

They referred to themselves as "a small family group of architects who have sought each other out because each has found the help of the others necessary to the development and understanding of their own individual work."&lt;ref name="alison"&gt;Smithson, Alison [ed] ''Team 10 Primer'', [[MIT Press|The MIT Press]], (1968), {{ISBN|0-289-79556-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Team 10's theoretical framework, disseminated primarily through teaching and publications, had a profound influence on the development of architectural thought in the second half of the 20th century, primarily in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Two different movements emerged from Team 10: the [[New Brutalism]] of the English members (Alison and Peter Smithson) and the [[Structuralism (architecture)|Structuralism]] of the Dutch members (Aldo van Eyck and Jacob Bakema).

==History==
Team 10's core group started meeting within the context of CIAM, the international platform for modern architects founded in 1928.&lt;ref name="Team10online Intro"&gt;http://www.team10online.org [http://www.team10online.org/team10/introduction.html ''Introduction - The Team 10 story''] by Max Risselada &amp; Dirk van den Heuvel.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3519">'''Technological somnambulism''' is a concept used when talking about the [[philosophy of technology]]. The term was used by [[Langdon Winner]] in his essay ''Technology as forms of life''. Winner puts forth the idea that we are simply in a state of ''sleepwalking'' in our mediations with [[technology]]. This sleepwalking is caused by a number of factors.  One of the primary causes is the way we view technology as tools, something that can be put down and picked up again.  Because of this view of objects as something we can easily separate ourselves from technology, and so we fail to look at the long term implications of using that object. A second factor is the separation of those who make the technology and those who use the technology. This division causes there to be little thought and research going into the effects of using/developing that technology. The third and most important idea is the way in which technology seems to create new ''worlds'' in which we live. These worlds are created by the restructuring of the common and seemingly everyday things around us. In most situations the changes take place with little attention or care from us because we are more focused on the menial aspects of &lt;!--using that--&gt;the technology (Winner 105-107).&lt;ref&gt;Winner, Langdon. "[http://hettingern.people.cofc.edu/Nature_Technology_and_Society_Fall_2010/Winner_Ttechnologies_as_Forms_of_Life.pdf Technologies as Forms of Life]". ''Readings in the Philosophy of Technology''. David M. Kaplan. Oxford: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0742564015}}. 103-113&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept can be found in the earlier work of [[Marshall McLuhan]], cf. ''[[Understanding Media]]'', where he refers to a comment made by [[David Sarnoff]] expressing a [[social determinism|socially deterministic]] view of "value free" technology whose value is solely defined by its usage as representing, "...the voice of the current somnambulism".&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall. ''Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man''. New York: McGraw Hill, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; Given that this piece by McLuhan has become standard reading in [[Media Theory]] it is reasonable to suspect that Winner encountered the concept there or elsewhere and then went on to develop it further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.cc.gatech.edu/je77/222|title=Media Theory Reading List|website=home.cc.gatech.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csmt.uchicago.edu/reading/montgomery.htm|title=Media Theory Reading List -- Harper Montgomery|website=csmt.uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://english.ucalgary.ca/Digital%20Humanities | title=Media Digital Humanities | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603180344/http://english.ucalgary.ca/Digital%20Humanities | archivedate=2013-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
