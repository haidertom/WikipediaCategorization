AFP is a major [[plasma protein]] produced by the [[yolk sac]] and the fetal liver during fetal development. It is thought to be the fetal analog of [[serum albumin]].  AFP [[Organocopper compound|binds to copper]], [[Organonickel|nickel]], [[fatty acid]]s and [[bilirubin]]&lt;ref name="entrez"/&gt; and is found in [[monomer]]ic, [[Protein dimer|dimeric]] and [[Protein trimer|trimeric]] forms.

== Structure ==

AFP is a [[glycoprotein]] of 591 amino acids&lt;ref name="pmid1709810"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pucci P, Siciliano R, Malorni A, Marino G, Tecce MF, Ceccarini C, Terrana B | title = Human alpha-fetoprotein primary structure: a mass spectrometric study | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 30 | issue = 20 | pages = 5061–6 |date=May 1991 | pmid = 1709810 | doi = 10.1021/bi00234a032| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a carbohydrate moiety.&lt;ref name="pmid7544570"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Seregni E, Botti C, Bombardieri E | title = Biochemical characteristics and clinical applications of alpha-fetoprotein isoforms | journal = Anticancer Res. | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 1491–9 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7544570 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
AFP is the most abundant plasma protein found in the human fetus. Maternal plasma levels peak near the end of the first trimester, and begin decreasing prenatally at that time, then decrease rapidly after birth. Normal adult levels are usually achieved by the age of 8 to 12 months. The function of AFP in adult humans is unknown; however, in rodents it binds [[estradiol]] to prevent the transport of this hormone across the [[placenta]] to the fetus. The main function of this is to prevent the [[virilization]] of female fetuses. As human AFP does not bind estrogen, its function in humans is less clear.&lt;ref name="isbn0-262-52321-3"&gt;{{cite book | editor = Becker JB  | title = Behavioral Endocrinology | chapter = Neuroendocrinology of sexual behavior in the female | author = Carter CS | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 2002  | pages = 88–89  | isbn = 0-262-52321-3 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=D6TnKbTRBJoC&amp;lpg=PA88&amp;ots=jgmtzhDR8p&amp;dq=AFP%20binds%20maternal%20estrogen&amp;pg=PA88#v=onepage&amp;q=AFP%20binds%20maternal%20estrogen&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rodent AFP system can be overridden with massive injections of estrogen, which overwhelm the AFP system and will masculinize the fetus. The masculinizing effect of estrogens may seem counter-intuitive since estrogens are critical for the proper development of female secondary characteristics during puberty. However, this is not the case prenatally. Gonadal hormones from the testes, such as [[testosterone]] and [[antimullerian hormone]] are required to cause development of a phenotypic male. Without these hormones the fetus will develop into a phenotypic female even if genetically [[XY sex-determination system|XY]]. The conversion of testosterone into estradiol by [[aromatase]] in many tissues may be an important step in masculinization of that tissue.&lt;ref name="pmid11124800"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nef S, Parada LF | title = Hormones in male sexual development | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 14 | issue = 24 | pages = 3075–86 |date=December 2000 | pmid = 11124800 | doi = 10.1101/gad.843800 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid1734525"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Elbrecht A, Smith RG | title=Aromatase enzyme activity and sex determination in chickens. | journal=Science | year= 1992 | volume= 255 | issue= 5043 | pages= 467–70 | pmid=1734525 | doi=  10.1126/science.1734525}}&lt;/ref&gt; Masculinization of the brain is thought to occur both by conversion of testosterone into estradiol by aromatase, but also by [[de novo synthesis]] of estrogens within the brain.&lt;ref name="pmid17720235"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bakker J, Baum MJ | title=Role for estradiol in female-typical brain and behavioral sexual differentiation. | journal=Front Neuroendocrinol | year= 2008 | volume= 29 | issue= 1 | pages= 1–16 | pmid=17720235 | doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2007.06.001 | pmc= 2373265 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15313793"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Harding CF| title=Hormonal modulation of singing: hormonal modulation of the songbird brain and singing behavior. | journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | year= 2004 | volume= 1016 | issue=  | pages= 524–39 | pmid=15313793 | doi=10.1196/annals.1298.030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, AFP may protect the fetus from maternal estradiol that would otherwise have a masculinizing effect on the fetus, but its exact role is still controversial.

== Serum levels ==
{{main|Elevated alpha-fetoprotein}}

=== Maternal ===

In pregnant women, fetal AFP levels can be monitored in urine. Since AFP is quickly cleared from the mother's serum via her kidneys, maternal urine AFP correlates with fetal serum levels, although the maternal urine level is much lower than the fetal serum level. AFP levels rise until about week 32.

=== Infants ===

The normal range of AFP for adults and children is variously reported as under 50, under 10, and under 5&amp;nbsp;ng/mL.&lt;ref name="pmid1375809"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ball D, Rose E, Alpert E | title = Alpha-fetoprotein levels in normal adults | journal = Am.

During this time, the normal range of AFP levels spans approximately 2 orders of magnitude.&lt;ref name="pmid2471821"/&gt;  Correct evaluation of ''abnormal'' AFP levels in infants must take into account these normal patterns.&lt;ref name="pmid2471821"/&gt;

Very high AFP levels may be subject to '''hooking''' (see [[Tumor marker]]), which results in the level being reported significantly lower than the actual concentration.&lt;ref name="pmid16824284"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jassam N, Jones CM, Briscoe T, Horner JH | title = The hook effect: a need for constant vigilance | journal = Ann.

== Clinical significance ==
{{main|Elevated alpha-fetoprotein}}
Measurement of AFP is generally used in two clinical contexts. First, it is measured in pregnant women through the analysis of maternal [[blood]] or [[amniotic fluid]] as a screening test for certain developmental abnormalities such as [[aneuploidy]].  Second, serum AFP level is elevated in people with certain tumors, and so it is used as a [[biomarker]] to follow these diseases. Some of these diseases are listed below:

'''Animal nutrition''' focuses on the dietary needs of [[animals]], primarily those in [[agriculture]] and food production, but also in zoos, aquariums, and wildlife management.

There are seven major classes of [[nutrient]]s: [[carbohydrates]], [[fat]]s, [[dietary fiber|fibre]], [[dietary minerals|minerals]], [[protein]]s, [[vitamin]]s, and [[water]].

==Constituents of diet==
Macronutrients (excluding fiber and water) provide structural material (amino acids from which proteins are built, and lipids from which cell membranes and some signaling molecules are built) and [[Bioenergetics|energy]]. Some of the structural material can be used to generate energy internally,&lt;ref name=Stryer&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Berg J, Tymoczko JL, Stryer L | title = Biochemistry | publisher = W.H. Freeman | edition = 5th | location = San Francisco | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-7167-4684-0 |page= 603 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though the net energy depends on such factors as absorption and digestive effort, which vary substantially from instance to instance. Vitamins, minerals, fiber, and water do not provide energy, but are required for other reasons. A third class dietary material, fiber (i.e., non-digestible material such as cellulose), seems also to be required, for both mechanical and biochemical reasons, though the exact reasons remain unclear.

Molecules of carbohydrates and fats consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. Carbohydrates range from simple [[monosaccharides]] (glucose, fructose, galactose) to complex [[polysaccharides]] (starch). Fats are [[triglyceride]]s, made of assorted [[fatty acid]] [[monomers]] bound to [[glycerol]] backbone. Some fatty acids, but not all, are [[essential fatty acids|essential]] in the diet: they cannot be synthesized in the body. Protein molecules contain nitrogen atoms in addition to carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. The fundamental components of protein are nitrogen-containing [[amino acids]]. [[Essential amino acids]] cannot be made by the animal. Some of the amino acids are convertible (with the expenditure of energy) to glucose and can be used for energy production just as ordinary glucose. By breaking down existing protein, some glucose can be produced internally; the remaining amino acids are discarded, primarily as urea in urine. This occurs normally only during prolonged starvation.

Other dietary substances found in plant foods ([[phytochemicals]], [[polyphenol]]s) are not identified as essential nutrients but appear to impact health in both positive and negative ways. Most foods contain a mix of some or all of the nutrient classes, together with other substances. Some nutrients can be stored internally (e.g., the fat soluble vitamins), while others are required more or less continuously. Poor health can be caused by a lack of required nutrients or, in extreme cases, too much of a required nutrient. For example, both salt provides sodium and chloride, both essential nutrients, but will cause illness or even death in too large amounts.

Dietary fibre is a [[carbohydrate]] (polysaccharide or oligosaccharide) that is incompletely absorbed in some animals. 

===Protein===
Proteins are the basis of many animal body structures (e.g. muscles, skin, and hair). They also form the enzymes which control chemical reactions throughout the body. Each molecule is composed of [[amino acids]] which are characterized by the inclusion of nitrogen and sometimes sulfur. The body requires amino acids to produce new proteins (protein retention) and to replace damaged proteins (maintenance). As there is no protein or amino acid storage provision, amino acids must be present in the diet. Excess amino acids are discarded, typically in the urine. For all animals, some amino acids are ''[[essential amino acid|essential]]'' (an animal cannot produce them internally) and some are ''[[non-essential amino acid|non-essential]]'' (the animal can produce them from other nitrogen-containing compounds). A diet that contains adequate amounts of amino acids (especially those that are essential) is particularly important in some situations: during early development and maturation, pregnancy, lactation, or injury (a burn, for instance). 

A few amino acids from protein can be converted into glucose and used for fuel through a process called [[gluconeogenesis]]; this is done in quantity only during starvation.

===Minerals===
Dietary [[Mineral (nutrient)|mineral]]s are the [[chemical element]]s required by living organisms, other than the four elements [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], and [[oxygen]] that are present in nearly all [[organic chemistry|organic molecules]]. The term "mineral" is archaic, since the intent is to describe simply the less common elements in the diet.

Many elements are essential in relative quantity; they are usually  called "bulk minerals". Some are structural, but many play a role as [[electrolyte]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Nelson, D. L. |author2=Cox, M. M. | title=Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry | edition=3rd | publisher=Worth Publishing | location=New York | year=2000 |  isbn=1-57259-153-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include:
* [[Calcium]], a common electrolyte, but also needed structurally structural (for muscle and digestive system health, bones, some forms neutralizes acidity, may help clear toxins, and provide signaling ions for nerve and membrane functions)
* [[Chlorine]] as [[chloride]] ions; very common electrolyte
* [[Magnesium]], required for processing [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and related reactions (builds bone, causes strong peristalsis, increases flexibility, increases alkalinity)
* [[Phosphorus]], required component of bones; essential for energy processing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=D. E. C. Corbridge | title=Phosphorus: An Outline of its Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Technology | edition=5th | publisher=Elsevier | location=Amsterdam | year=1995 | isbn=0-444-89307-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Potassium]], a very common electrolyte (heart and nerve health)
* [[Sodium]], a very common electrolyte
* [[Sulfur]] for three amino acids and therefore many proteins (skin, hair, nails, liver, and pancreas)

Many elements are required in trace amounts, usually because they play a [[catalytic]] role in [[enzymes]].&lt;ref name=lipp&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lippard, S. J.  |author2=Berg, J. M. | title=Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry | publisher=University Science Books | location=Mill Valley, CA | year=1994 | isbn=0-935702-73-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vitamins===
[[Vitamin]] deficiencies may result in disease conditions. Excess of some vitamins is also dangerous to health (notably [[vitamin A]]), and animal nutrition researchers have managed to establish safe levels for some common companion animals.&lt;ref&gt;Morris PJ, Salt C, Raila J, Brenten T, Kohn B, Schweigert FJ, Zentek J. Safety evaluation of vitamin A in growing dogs. British Journal of Nutrition. 2012; 108(10):1800-1809.&lt;/ref&gt; Deficiency or excess of minerals can also have serious health consequences.

==Ash==
Though not really a nutrient as such, an entry for ''ash'' is sometimes found on nutrition labels, especially for [[pet food]].  This entry measures the weight of inorganic material left over after the food is burned for two hours at 600&amp;nbsp;°C.  Thus, it does not include water, fibre, and nutrients that provide calories, but it does include some nutrients, such as minerals &lt;ref&gt;Purina; [http://www.purinaone.com/CoolTools/Nutrition101.aspx?ArticleId=CE5F9A76-C480-496F-A0B1-9BDAA4675A4F The Facts About Dietary Ash] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721050811/http://www.purinaone.com/CoolTools/Nutrition101.aspx?ArticleId=CE5F9A76-C480-496F-A0B1-9BDAA4675A4F |date=July 21, 2011 }}; last checked 2009-07-22&lt;/ref&gt;

Too much ash may contribute to [[feline urological syndrome]] in [[domestic cat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;R. Glenn Brown; [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1680954 Low ash cat foods: The role of magnesium in feline nutrition]; Canadian Veterinary Journal 1989 January 30(1): 73–79; last checked 2009-07-22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intestinal bacterial flora==
Animal [[intestine]]s contain a large population of [[gut flora]] which are essential to [[digestion]], and are also affected by the food eaten.

'''Anthoxanthins''' ([[flavone]]s and [[flavonol]]s)&lt;ref&gt;Isolation of a UDP-glucose: Flavonoid 5-O-glucosyltransferase gene and expression analysis of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes in herbaceous peony (Paeonia lactiflora Pall.).

Anthoxanthins are water-soluble pigments which range in color from white or colorless to a creamy to yellow, often on petals of flowers. These pigments are generally whiter in an acid medium and yellowed in an [[alkaline]] medium. They are very susceptible to color changes with minerals and metal ions, similar to anthocyanins. As with all flavonoids, they exhibit antioxidant properties, and are important in [[nutrition]], and are sometimes used as [[food additive]]s. Darkening with iron is particularly prominent in food products. They are considered to have more variety than  [[anthocyanins]]. Some examples are [[quercitin]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33172">'''Chemical castration''' is [[castration]] via [[anaphrodisiac]] [[drug]]s, whether to reduce [[libido]] and sexual activity, [[management of cancer|to treat cancer]], or otherwise.

In May 2016, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that a number of countries use chemical castration on [[rape|rapists]] and [[pedophilia|pedophiles]], often in return for reduced sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/world/asia/indonesia-chemical-castration.html|title=Indonesia Approves Castration for Sex Offenders Who Prey on Children|first=Joe|last=Cochrane|date=May 25, 2016|accessdate=September 16, 2017|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
===On men===
When used on men, these drugs can reduce sex drive, compulsive sexual fantasies, and capacity for [[sexual arousal]]. Life-threatening side effects are rare, but some users show increases in body fat and reduced bone density, which increase long-term risk of [[cardiovascular disease]] and [[osteoporosis]]. They may also experience [[gynecomastia]] (development of larger-than-normal mammary glands in males) as seen in [[Alan Turing]]'s case.

===On women===
{{further|Oophorectomy}}
When used on women, the effects are similar, though there is little research about chemically lowering women's sex drive or female-specific anaphrodisiacs, since most research focuses on the opposite, but anti-androgenic hormone regimens would lower testosterone in women which can impact sex drive or sexual response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/oophorectomy/basics/risks/prc-20012991|title=Oophorectomy (ovary removal surgery) - Risks|website=Mayoclinic.org|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news-medical.net/health/Oophorectomy-Risks.aspx|title=Oophorectomy Risks|date=16 August 2010|website=News-medical.net|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.3109/13697130903075345|title=Risk of hypoactive sexual desire disorder and associated factors in a cohort of oophorectomized women|first1=C.|last1=Castelo-Branco|first2=S.|last2=Palacios|first3=J.|last3=Combalia|first4=M.|last4=Ferrer|first5=G.|last5=Traveria|date=1 December 2009|journal=Climacteric|volume=12|issue=6|pages=525–532|accessdate=16 September 2017|via=Taylor and Francis+NEJM|doi=10.3109/13697130903075345|pmid=19905904}}&lt;/ref&gt; These drugs also deflate the breast glands and expand the size of the nipple.

==Treatment for sex offenders==
The first use of chemical castration occurred in 1944, when [[diethylstilbestrol]] was used with the purpose of lowering men's testosterone.&lt;ref name=JAAPL /&gt;
The [[antipsychotic]] agent [[benperidol]] is sometimes used to diminish sexual urges in people who display inappropriate sexual behavior, and can likewise be given by depot injection. But benperidol does not affect testosterone and is therefore not a castration agent.
Chemical castration is often seen as an easier alternative to [[life imprisonment]] or the [[death penalty]] because it allows the release of sex offenders while reducing or eliminating the chance that they reoffend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Ocala Star-Banner|date=21 February 1997|title=Bill would impose castration for convicted rapists|page=4B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, in an experiment by P. Gagne, 48 males with long-standing histories of sexually deviant behaviour were given [[medroxyprogesterone acetate]] for as long as 12 months. Forty of those subjects were recorded as to have diminished desires for deviant sexual behaviour, less frequent sexual fantasies, and greater control over sexual urges. The research recorded a continuation of this more positive behaviour after the administration of the drug had ended with no evidence of adverse side effects and recommended medroxyprogesterone acetate along with counselling as a successful method of treatment for serial sex offenders.&lt;ref name="apa"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/138/5/644|title=Treatment of sex offenders with medroxyprogesterone acetate|date=1 April 2006|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|accessdate=16 September 2017|via=ajp.psychiatryonline.org|doi=10.1176/ajp.138.5.644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific critique===
Citing the observation that spaying causes female animals to stop mating in the same species as castration cause male animals to stop mating, and that in the animal species where females continue their mating behaviour after being spayed the males also continue to mate after being castrated, there are scientists who argue that it makes no biological sense to assume that any treatment that emulates castration would remove sex drive in men but not in women. These scientists argue that these observations, along with the fact that humans are animals and subject to [[evolution]], show that it is flawed to think that male sexuality would be treatable by medication if female sexuality is not.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Aunger, Valerie Curtis (2015)"Gaining Control: How human behavior evolved"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(2015). "The myth of female sexual complexity"&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some criminologists argue that the appearance of a lower recidivism rate in male sex offenders who take chemical castration treatment than in those who do not can be explained by factors other than biological effects of the medication. One hypothesis is that men who accept the negative effects of hormonal treatment in exchange for shorter prison sentence are distinct in that they value freedom from incarceration higher than men who rather stay in prison for a longer time than face the side effects of chemical castration. These criminologists explain apparently lower recidivism as an artifact of men who accept chemical castration being more engaged in hiding the evidence for reoffending, and that paroling such offenders constitute a risk of releasing criminals who commit as many new crimes as others but are better at hiding it. These criminologists also argue that police investigators treating castrated men as less likely to reoffend than non-castrated men may cause an investigation bias and [[self-fulfilling prophecy]], and that men who sell some of their prescribed medicines on the black market for drugs get a hidden income that improve their ability to afford measures to hide recidivism that is not available to men without such prescriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Horne, Michael J. Lovaglia (2008). "Experiments in Criminology and Law: A Research Revolution"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sergio Sismondo, Jeremy A. Greene (2015). "The Pharmaceutical Studies Reader"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lorie A. Fridell (2016). "Producing Bias-Free Policing: A Science-Based Approach"&lt;/ref&gt;

Some neurologists acknowledge that testosterone plays a role in sexual arousal but that reducing sex drive will likely not reduce inappropriate sex behaviour. These researchers argue that since a weaker internal signal in the brain means a higher requirement for external stimulation to create a feedback loop that tires the brain circuits out as in orgasm and lead to satisfaction, a reduction of the internal stimulation from hormones would make the required external stimulation stronger and also more specific, as weaker signals involve narrower ranges of other brain functions in their loops. These scientists therefore argue that the biological (as opposed to sociological) effect of reduced testosterone is to make it more difficult and not easier to use masturbation without pornography or other socially acceptable substitutes to manage remaining sex drive in a former offender, and that many community persons (both male and female) find that a lower initial arousal makes it more difficult to orgasm by masturbation without pornography or with non-preferred stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;KC Berridge (2015).

===Argentina===
In March 2010, Guillermo Fontana of [[CNN]] reported that officials in [[Mendoza (province)|Mendoza]], a [[Provinces of Argentina|province]] in [[Argentina]], approved the use of voluntary chemical castration for rapists, in return for reduced sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/03/19/argentina.castration/index.html |author=Fontana, Guillermo| work=[[CNN]] | title=Argentina province OKs chemical castration for rapists | date=March 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
In 2010, a repeat child sex offender who had been subject to chemical castration was accused of inappropriately touching and kissing a young girl. He was found not guilty by a jury, which was not informed of the context of his previous offenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Townsville Bulletin|date=30 October 2010|author=Roanne Johnson|title=Convicted paedophile allowed to look after kids|url=https://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2010/10/30/181291_news.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519161443/https://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2010/10/30/181291_news.html |archivedate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
The drug [[cyproterone acetate]] has been commonly used for chemical castration throughout Europe.  It resembles the drug MPA used in America.&lt;ref name=JAAPL /&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], computer scientist [[Alan Turing#Conviction for indecency|Alan Turing]], famous for his contributions to mathematics and computer science, was a homosexual who was forced to undergo chemical castration in order to avoid imprisonment in 1952.&lt;ref name=Independent /&gt;  At the time, homosexual acts between males were still illegal and homosexual orientation was widely considered to be a mental illness that could be treated with chemical castration.&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/the-turing-enigma-campaigners-demand-pardon-for-mathematics-genius-1773480.html The Turing enigma: Campaigners demand pardon for mathematics genius] by Jonathan Brown for the ''Independent'', August 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Turing experienced side effects such as breast enlargement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sullivan|first=Andrew|title=An Apology To Alan Turing|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/daily-dish/archive/2009/09/an-apology-to-alan-turing/196673/|work=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=20 October 2013|authorlink=Andrew Sullivan|archiveurl=http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/09/an-apology-to-alan-turing.html|archivedate=11 September 2009|date=11 September 2009|quote=[...] One of the known side effects of these hormone injections was the development of breasts, known as gynecomastia, something which plagued Turing for the rest of his life.

In 2008, an experimental intervention program was launched in three [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[prison]]s: Carregueira ([[Sintra Municipality|Belas, Sintra]]), [[Paços de Ferreira]] and [[Funchal]]. The program developers note the voluntary nature of the program a crucial factor in its success. They initially planned to cover ten inmates per prison, contemplating a possible enlargement to other prisons in the future. The program also included a [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]] component.&lt;ref name="Portugal"&gt;{{cite news |title = Mais condenações por abuso sexual de menor |publisher = [[Diário de Notícias]] |date = 5 October 2011 |url = http://umonline.uminho.pt/ModuleLeft.aspx?mdl=~/Modules/Clipping/NoticiaView.ascx&amp;ItemID=49257&amp;Mid=119&amp;lang=pt-PT&amp;pageid=74&amp;tabid=13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130928013803/http://umonline.uminho.pt/ModuleLeft.aspx?mdl=~%2FModules%2FClipping%2FNoticiaView.ascx&amp;ItemID=49257&amp;Mid=119&amp;lang=pt-PT&amp;pageid=74&amp;tabid=13 |archivedate = 2013-09-28 |deadurl = yes |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October and November 2013, the [[Macedonia (country)|Macedonian]] authorities were working on developing a legal framework and standard procedure for implementation of chemical castration that would be used for convicted [[Child sexual abuse|child molester]]s. The castration is intended to be voluntarily, where as for the child molesters that repeat the criminal act it should be mandatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novamakedonija.com.mk/NewsDetal.asp?vest=11151396396&amp;id=12&amp;prilog=0&amp;setIzdanie=23028 |title=Хемиската кастрација за педофилите  ги подели психијатрите и правниците |work=novamakedonija.com.mk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131119224033/http://www.novamakedonija.com.mk/NewsDetal.asp?vest=11151396396&amp;id=12&amp;prilog=0&amp;setIzdanie=23028 |archivedate=2013-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
After the outrage following the [[2012 Delhi gang rape case|gang rape of a woman]] in [[Delhi]], the Government has submitted a draft proposing chemical castration along with an imprisonment of up to 30 years for rape convicts as part of the anti-rape law in India. The ministry is preparing a detailed bill and the recommended changes are under review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/generalnews/news/cong-draft-anti-rape-law-proposes-chemical-castration/102114/|title=Cong draft anti-rape law proposes chemical castration|author=Press Trust of India|date=30 December 2012|work=business-standard.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/congress-draft-antirape-law-proposes-chemical-castration/313080-37-64.html|title=Congress anti-rape law draft proposes chemical castration|work=IBNLive}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Government is also planning to re-define the Juvenile Act and lower their age. One of the accused in the rape case is a juvenile and aged a few months less than 18 years. A view has been expressed by a section that only those below 15 years should be described as juvenile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-12-30/india/36063952_1_chemical-castration-draft-bill-check-crimes | work=The Times Of India | title=Congress anti-rape draft bill proposes 30 years jail, chemical castration - The Times of India | date=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indonesia===
In 2016, the Indonesian President [[Joko Widodo]] introduced a presidential regulation to allow chemical castration to be handed down as a punishment to child sex offenders and [[Pedophilia|pedophiles]]. The regulation alters the contents of the 2002 Law on Child Protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/world/asia/indonesia-chemical-castration.html|title=Indonesia Approves Castration for Sex Offenders Who Prey on Children|last=Cochrane|first=Joe|date=2016-05-25|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In New Zealand, the [[Antiandrogen|antilibidinal drug]] [[cyproterone acetate]] is sold under the name Androcur. In November 2000 convicted [[paedophile]] Robert Jason Dittmer attacked a victim while on the drug. In 2009 a study into the effectiveness of the drug by Dr David Wales for the Corrections Department found that no research had been conducted in New Zealand into the effectiveness and such trials were "ethically and practically very difficult to carry out."&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_5264564"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/5264564/Chemicals-don-t-always-stop-sex-offenders |title=Chemicals don't always stop sex offenders |author=Francis, Clio |date=11 July 2011 |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]] |accessdate=23 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
In October 2011, the Russian parliament approved a law that allows a court-requested forensic psychiatrist to prescribe the chemical castration of convicted sex offenders who have harmed children under the age of 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://rt.com/news/pedophilia-russia-chemical-castration-059/ | work=RT | title=Russia introduces chemical castration for pedophiles | date=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===
In July 2011, South Korea enacted a law allowing judges the power to sentence sex offenders who have attacked children under the age of 16 to chemical castration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/07/24/idINIndia-58423020110724 | work=Reuters | title=S. Korea enacts 'chemical castration' law to punish paedophiles | date=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law also allows for chemical castration to be ordered by a Ministry of Justice committee. On May 23, 2012, a serial sex offender legally called Park in the court case was ordered by the committee to undergo this treatment after his most recent attempted offense. On January 3, 2013, a South Korean court sentenced a 31-year-old man to 15 years in jail and chemical castration, the country's first-ever chemical castration sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Hindu| url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/south-korean-court-orders-first-chemical-castration/article4269112.ece |title=South Korean court orders first chemical castration|date=3 January 2013|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://nwww.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20130103000795 | work=Korea Herald| title=Court issues 1st chemical castration sentence | date=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, feminist-backed Moon Jaein administration expanded the sentencing to include all forms of rapes and sexual assault cases against women, including attempted rape.

In South Korea, taking pictures of women without their consent, even in public, is considered to be criminal [[sexual assault]], punishable by a fine of under 10 million [[South Korean won|won]] and up to 5 years' imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.go.kr/%EB%B2%95%EB%A0%B9/%EC%84%B1%ED%8F%AD%EB%A0%A5%EB%B2%94%EC%A3%84%EC%9D%98%20%EC%B2%98%EB%B2%8C%20%EB%93%B1%EC%97%90%20%EA%B4%80%ED%95%9C%20%ED%8A%B9%EB%A1%80%EB%B2%95 "South Korean law on criminal sexual assault, Chapter 1 Article 14"]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017 an amendment to the law was voted on in favour of allowing for chemical castration of people taking such photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edaily.co.kr/news/NewsRead.edy?newsid=01298886615999112&amp;SCD=JG31&amp;DCD=A00703|title=`몰카 찰칵했다간 철컹`…몰카범도 화학적 거세한다|first1=Ⓒ 종합 경제정보 미디어 이데일리-상업적|last1=무단전재|first2=재배포|last2=금지|date=28 July 2017|website=edaily|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment did not pass.

===United States===
In 1966, John Money became the first American to employ chemical castration by prescribing [[medroxyprogesterone acetate]] (MPA, the base ingredient now used in [[Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate|DMPA]]) as a treatment for a patient dealing with pedophilic urges.  The drug has thereafter become a mainstay of chemical castration in America. Despite its long history and established use, the drug has never been approved by the FDA for use as a treatment for sexual offenders.&lt;ref name=JAAPL /&gt;

California was the first U.S. state to specify the use of chemical castration as a punishment for [[child molestation]], following the passage of a modification to Section 645 of the [[California]] [[penal code]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="califsenate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sen.ca.gov/ftp/SEN/COMMITTEE/STANDING/PUBLICSAFETY/bills/_6bill12.htm |title=XII.

The passage of this law led to similar laws in other states such as Florida's Statute Section 794.0235 which was passed into law in 1997.&lt;ref name="floridalawreview"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Florida's 1997 Chemical Castration Law: A Return to the Dark Ages |first=Larry Helm |last=Spalding |journal=[[Florida State University Law Review]] |year=1998 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=117–139 |url=http://neuro.bcm.edu/eagleman/neurolaw/papers/&amp;#91;Spalding&amp;#93;FloridasChemicalCastrationLaw.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613193448/http://neuro.bcm.edu/eagleman/neurolaw/papers/%5BSpalding%5DFloridasChemicalCastrationLaw.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As in California, treatment is mandatory after a second offense.

At least seven other states, including [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Iowa]], [[Louisiana]], [[Montana]], [[Oregon]], [[Texas]] and [[Wisconsin]], have experimented with chemical castration.&lt;ref name=JAAPL /&gt; In Iowa, as in California and Florida, offenders may be sentenced to chemical castration in all cases involving serious sex offenses.  On June 25, 2008, following the Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Kennedy v. Louisiana]]'' that the execution of child rapists where the victim was not killed was ruled unconstitutional,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rossmeier |first=Vincent |title=Jindal approves castration for sex offenders |url=http://www.salon.com/2008/06/26/jindal_castration/ |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |publisher=Salon Media Group |accessdate=October 20, 2013 |date=June 26, 2008 |quote=On Wednesday, the Supreme Court ruled that it's unconstitutional to execute someone for a case of child rape "where the victim's life was not taken."

====Objections====

The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] of [[Florida]] opposes the administration of any drug that is dangerous or has significant irreversible effect as an alternative to incarceration; however, they do not oppose the use of antiandrogen drugs for sex offenders under carefully controlled circumstances as an alternative to incarceration.&lt;ref name="aclufl"&gt;{{cite journal| publisher=Florida State University Law Review | title=Florida's 1997 Chemical Castration Law: A Return to the Dark Ages | author=Larry Helm Spalding | volume=25:117 | pages=124 | url=https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=25+Fla.+St.+U.L.+Rev.+117&amp;key=764569c9c4bb55ecfefa69a00154ff9d | quote=Furthermore, the ACLU of Florida opposes any attempt to offer a defendant the opportunity to avoid incarceration by taking a drug that is dangerous or that has a significant irreversible effect on an individual’s cognitive capacity or an important physical function, such as the ability to conceive children.  The ACLU of Florida does not oppose the use of antiandrogen drugs under certain controlled circumstances as an alternative to incarceration for convicted sex offenders. Because the ACLU of Florida respects individual autonomy and supports the principle that punishment should be no more restrictive of liberty than necessary, an individual’s choice of whether to accept an antiandrogen drug is entitled to considerable respect. In addition, because this choice arises in the inherently coercive context of sentencing, and because of the capacity for abuse of this sentencing option, such treatment should be available only under the most carefully controlled circumstances. | date=1998| access-date=March 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Law professor John Stinneford has argued that chemical castration is a cruel and unusual punishment because it exerts control over the mind of sex offenders to render them incapable of sexual desire and subjects them to the physical changes caused by the female hormones used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=918271|title=Incapacitation through Maiming: Chemical Castration, the Eighth Amendment, and the Denial of Human Dignity|first=John F.|last=Stinneford|date=20 July 2006|website=Paoers.ssrn.com|accessdate=16 September 2017|via=papers.ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people have argued that, based on the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]], the procedure fails to guarantee equal protection: although the laws mandating the treatment do so without respect to gender, the actual effect of the procedure disproportionately falls upon men.&lt;ref name=JAAPL&gt;[http://www.jaapl.org/cgi/reprint/31/4/502.pdf "Castration of Sex Offenders: Prisoners’ Rights Versus Public Safety"] Charles L. Scott, MD, and Trent Holmberg, MD&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of voluntary statutes, the ability to give [[informed consent]] is also an issue; in 1984, the [[U.S. state]] of [[Michigan]]'s court of appeals held that mandating chemical castration as a condition of probation was unlawful on the grounds that the drug [[medroxyprogesterone acetate]] had not yet gained acceptance as being safe and reliable and also due to the difficulty of obtaining informed consent under these circumstances.&lt;ref name="JAAPL" /&gt;

==Treatment for cancer patients==
A major medical use of chemical castration is in the treatment of hormone-dependent cancers, such as some [[prostate cancer]], where it has largely replaced the practice of surgical castration.&lt;ref name="cruk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-help/type/prostate-cancer/treatment/hormone/about-hormone-therapy-for-prostate-cancer|title=About hormone therapy for prostate cancer|work=cancerresearchuk.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LIFEonADT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifeonadt.com/the-adt-book/|title=The ADT Book|work=Life on ADT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemical castration involves the administration of [[antiandrogen]] drugs, such as [[cyproterone acetate]], [[flutamide]], or [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist]]s.

Every child has the '''right to adequate nutrition''' under the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. In New Zealand, an estimated 100,000 New Zealand children go to school every day without breakfast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nzma.org.nz/journal/read-the-journal/all-issues/2010-2019/2014/vol-127-no-1407/6383 |title=Food in schools: targeting versus the right to food - New Zealand Medical Journal |publisher=Nzma.org.nz |date= |accessdate=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/debates/debates/50HansD_20140528_00000044/education-breakfast-and-lunch-programmes-in-schools-amendment|title=Education (Breakfast and Lunch Programmes in Schools) Amendment Bill — First Reading|last=(HoR)|first=Reporting Services|date=2014-05-28|website=Parliament.nz|language=en-NZ|access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 11 of the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] recognises 'the fundamental right for everyone to be free from hunger’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hhr/Economic_social_cultural.pdf |format=PDF |title=International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights |website=Who.int |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Auckland]] region, there are approximately 43,000 children in decile 1 and 2 state schools. Of these 57% are [[Pacific Islander|Pasifica]], 30% are [[Māori people|Māori]], and 4% are [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]]. The remaining 9% are [[Asian people|Asian]]/[[Middle Eastern]] and other ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="cpag.org.nz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpag.org.nz/assets/Publications/2-0%2025804%20Hunger%20for%20Learning%20Brochure.pdf |format=PDF |title=Hunger for Learning |website=Cpag.org.nz |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ministry of Health (New Zealand)|Ministry of Health]] advised the Minister in 2006 that "decile one and two schools draw their students from our most vulnerable communities and cope with multiple issues related to poverty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.govt.nz |title=Ministry of Health NZ |publisher=Health.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 Ministry of Health survey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.govt.nz/publication/portrait-health-key-results-2002-03-new-zealand-health-survey |title=A Portrait of Health: Key results of the 2002/03 New Zealand Health Survey &amp;#124; Ministry of Health NZ |publisher=Health.govt.nz |date=2004-08-01 |accessdate=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that there is a high percentage of children between the age of 5 to 14 who "sometimes or always ate nothing before school",&lt;ref name="cpag.org.nz"/&gt; compared to a New Zealand Health Survey that found around 15% of children leave for school without eating breakfast.

The [[Children's Ombudsman#New Zealand|Children's Commissioner]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.occ.org.nz |title=Home » Office of the Children’s Commissioner |publisher=Occ.org.nz |date= |accessdate=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; released a Framework for Food in Schools Programme stating "Children need to be fed adequately for a range of nutritional, educational and social reasons and should be fed regardless of their parent's income or status. To end this, breakfast should be made available to decile 1 and 2 primary, intermediate and primary intermediate combined schools."

==Background==
The evolution of children’s right itself to adequate nutrition has fast been on the rise in the last 10 years.  In 2004, 26% of children were reported as living in serious or significant hardship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpag.org.nz/assets/sm/upload/jq/66/v2/dv/WEB%20VERSION%20OF%20LFB.pdf |format=PDF |title=Left Further Behind |website=Cpag.org.nz |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, the [[Child Poverty Action Group]] published ''Hard to Swallow''&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpag.org.nz/assets/Publications/HTS.pdf |format=PDF |title=Hard to Swallow : Foodbank Use in New Zealand |website=Occ.org.nz |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; which sounded alarms about the increasing number of families who resorted to using food banks.  Key recommendations of the 2005 report that free but good quality breakfasts should be provided for children in decile 1 and 2 primary and intermediate schools as a means of ensuring that the most vulnerable children were sufficiently nourished to enable them to learn efficiently  at school.

Past Governments have ignored the problem or helped construct the public debate of the issue portrayed as one of parental failure.  Poor quality diet has also been portrayed as a matter of personal preference.  The [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Labour Government]] in 2000-2008 responded to the poor diet with social marketing campaigns such as Push-Play,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/move-it-or-lose-it-–-push-play-30-minutes-day] {{dead link|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; aiming to encourage families to eat healthier foods to improve people's health and fitness.  In the early 2000s, the Treasury found poor child nutrition is a risk factor for the child's ability to learn.

The current [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|National Government]] has avoided the debate about food insecurity, instead claiming ‘poor food choices’ and removed Labour’s public health initiates around healthy eating and exercise in 2008.

Nationally, there are 115,000 children in decile 1 and 2 primary and intermediate, and secondary schools with private charities, schools and teachers scrambling to fill the nutrition gaps of many of these students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/statistics/schooling/student-numbers/6028 |title=School Rolls |publisher=Education Counts |date= |accessdate=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand policymakers aim to create equality of opportunity for children as part of a broader social investment strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.msd.govt.nz/about-msd-and-our-work/publications-resources/ |title=Publications and resources - Ministry of Social Development |publisher=Msd.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Providing breakfast, free, to all children attending decile 1 and 2 primary and intermediate schools would be one positive way to achieve this stated policy aim.  It would also help redress the balance in favour of the low-income households that have found themselves left further behind as New Zealand’s income inequality has grown over the last thirty years.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===International obligations===
The [[United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child]] furthers a stand to which the child has a sufficient right to adequate nutrition.  Relevant provisions are set out in Article 27.

States Parties recognise the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the child's physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development.

# The parent(s) or others responsible for the child have the primary responsibility to secure, within their abilities and financial capacities, the conditions of living necessary for the child's development.
# States Parties, in accordance with national conditions and within their means, shall take appropriate measures to assist parents and others responsible for the child to implement this right and shall in the case of need provide material assistance and support programmes, particularly with regard to nutrition, clothing and housing.

School food programmes would also be consistent with the conclusion of the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child in New Zealand.  The Committee’s recommendation in paragraph 43:&lt;ref name="UN Convention"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.govt.nz/policy/constitutional-law-and-human-rights/human-rights/international-human-rights-instruments/international-human-rights-instruments-1/united-nations-convention-on-the-rights-of-the-child|title=United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child — Ministry of Justice, New Zealand|website=Justice.govt.nz|access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''"The Committee recommends that the State Party take all necessary measures to provide appropriate support to allow disadvantaged families and their children to move out of poverty in a sustained way, while at the same time, continuing to provide assistance to those living below the poverty line"''&lt;ref name="UN Convention"/&gt;

===The Scottish Experiment===
The Scottish Government have achieved a successful model for 'breakfast clubs'&lt;ref&gt;http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/resources/b/genericresource_tcm4207824.asp&lt;/ref&gt; with the particular focus on children with the greatest need. 
The decision here was drawn to provide food for children in school both to improve students' education and improve their diets.&lt;ref name="Scotland's breakfast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communityfoodandhealth.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/breakfastclub-0632.pdf |format=PDF |title=Breakfast Clubs ... More of a Head Start |website=Communityfoodandhealth.org.uk |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The philosophy behind food in Scottish schools is a ‘whole school’ approach that recognises food sits within children’s social context.&lt;ref name="Scotland's breakfast"/&gt;

The contrast with the New Zealand government’s reliance on corporate beneficence and private charity could not be more abrupt. 
Breakfast clubs have been present in Scotland for many years.  An evaluation of Glasgow’s project provides some insight into the variations between schools that make a school-by-school approach more sensible than a one- size- fits-all model.&lt;ref name="Scotland's breakfast"/&gt;

The evaluation found the factors affecting the likely success and delivery of breakfasts include: 
*  availability and sustainability of funding; 
*   availability and sustainability of assistance. Paid staff and volunteers can be difficult to recruit and retain 
*    local support for the club. 
*    support for the aims of the club, i.e. whether health promotion is included as part of the programme, or whether there is a perception that the programme is a babysitting service; 
*    school catchment and attendance levels. Some schools charged for breakfast, and the evaluation found attendance at breakfast clubs was lower in areas where low-income families are less likely to be able to afford breakfasts; 
*    operational and logistical issues including food quality and health and safety considerations. This may include the safety of children coming to school early (e.g. across busy roads with no supervised crossings).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2003/02/16273/17574|title=Hungry for Success - A Whole School Approach to School Meals in Scotland:|last=ceu@scotland.gsi.gov.uk|first=Scottish Government, St. Andrew's House, Regent Road, Edinburgh EH1 3DG Tel:0131 556 8400|date=2003-02-19|website=www.gov.scot|access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand Programmes==
New Zealand has no national scheme for food in schools, however, there are adequate non-Government programmes operating in hundreds of schools.&lt;ref name="cpag.org.nz"/&gt;  Boards of Trustees have absolute jurisdiction in the management of the school, within the general law of New Zealand.  The only rules currently mandated by central Government with regard to food in schools is National Administrative Guideline 5;&lt;ref name="NAG Guidelines"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.govt.nz/ministry-of-education/legislation/nags/|title=The National Administration Guidelines (NAGs)|last=Zealand|first=Education in New|website=Education in New Zealand|language=en-NZ|access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#    Each board of trustees is also required to provide a safe physical and emotional environment for students; 
#    promote healthy food and nutrition for all students; and 
#    comply in full with any legislation currently in force or that may be developed to ensure the safety of students and employees.&lt;ref name="NAG Guidelines"/&gt;

===Current programmes===
*	'''KidsCan''':  Providing non-perishable goods such as bread, baked beans and spreads to 276 participating schools on a termly basis.

Generally, schools initiate programmes because they are concerned with the quality of the students’ food.  The ''Fruit in Schools'' programme appears to have provided an incentive to shift schools to having a greater focus on the health aspects of foods.&lt;ref name="Fruit in Schools programme"/&gt;

===Funding===
Schools operate their breakfast programmes at little or no cost and are usually run by the Red Cross, Kickstart Project and local churches.  The National Government in 2013 started to fund 50% of the expansion Food in Schools programme over a five-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/8724642/Govt-rolls-out-expanded-food-in-schools|title=Govt rolls out expanded food in schools|last=Rutherford|first=Kate Chapman and Hamish|date=2013-05-28|newspaper=Stuff.co.nz|language=English|access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Schools have different experiences with recruiting and retaining volunteers from within the community: some school programmes are run by teachers, others are run by volunteers drawn from within the school, and parents.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpag.org.nz/assets/Publications/2-0%2025804%20Hunger%20for%20Learning%20Brochure.pdf |format=PDF |title=Hunger for Learning |website=Cpag.org.nz |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most donations from businesses or individuals tend to be in a way of food rather than money.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Education (Breakfast and Lunch programmes in schools) Amendment Bill==
The ''Education (Breakfast and Lunch programmes in schools) Amendment Bill''&lt;ref name="nzlii.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/bill/ealpisab2012557/ |title=Education (Breakfast and Lunch Programmes in Schools) Amendment Bill 2012 |publisher=Nzlii.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; was developed to provide a legislative basis for making food in schools available to all decile 1 to 3 primary and intermediate schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/legislation/bills/00DBHOH_BILL12617_1/education-food-in-schools-amendment-bill |title=New Zealand Parliament - Education (Food in Schools) Amendment Bill |publisher=Parliament.nz |date=2015-03-18 |accessdate=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This Bill will amend the Education Act 1989 providing the introduction of a fully funded State breakfast and lunch programmes, however was not passed.&lt;ref name="nzlii1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/bill/ealpisab2012557/|title=Education (Breakfast and Lunch Programmes in Schools) Amendment Bill 2012|website=Nzlii.org|access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Catering to all decile 1 and 2 schools and other designated schools in New Zealand. The meals will be available to all enrolled students in these schools free of charge, and will be required to meet Ministry of Health nutritional guidelines.
The introduction of State led and funded food in schools programmes in low decile schools has been recommended by the [[Child Poverty Action Group]] in their 2011 report ''Hunger for learning'', where nutritional barriers to children’s education, and by the Children’s Commissioner’s ''Solutions to child poverty in New Zealand''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.occ.org.nz/assets/Uploads/EAG/Final-report/Final-report-Solutions-to-child-poverty-evidence-for-action.pdf |format=PDF |title=Solutions for Child Poverty in New Zealand |website=Occ.org.nz |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a key measure to address child poverty.&lt;ref name="nzlii.org"/&gt;
In conjunction with the Ministry of Health, the [[Ministry of Education]] will develop a plan to monitor schools at least once every 12 months to ensure they are providing meals each day they are open for instruction and that the meals follow nutritional guidelines.&lt;ref name="nzlii1"/&gt; An evaluation of the breakfast and lunch programmes will be conducted within the first 3 years to further develop and improve their effectiveness.&lt;ref name="nzlii.org"/&gt;

==Benefits of current programmes==
Breakfast, in particular, has been found to have a beneficial effect on children’s study, behaviour, and attendance and there is mounting evidence that eating a good quality breakfast reduces the risk of obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.occ.org.nz/assets/Uploads/Reports/Poverty/A-framework-for-food-in-schools.pdf |format=PDF |title=A FRAMEWORK FOR FOOD IN SCHOOLS PROGRAMMES IN NEW ZEALAND |website=Occ.org.nz |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Evidence for the benefit of breakfast for children is mixed. In large part, this is due to benefits diminishing as children get older and exercise more control over their food intake, with older children being more likely to skip breakfast altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Eating Breakfast and its Impact on Children’s Daily Diet|author1=Wilson, N. |author2=Parnell, W. |author3=Wohlers, M. |author4= Shirley, P. |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For younger children the evidence is clear that breakfast provides a number of benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Children, Food and Poverty: Food Insecurity Among Primary School Students in the Wellington Region. Unpublished thesis, School of Social and Cultural Studies, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington.|last=Gerritson|first=S|publisher=Unpublished thesis, School of Social and Cultural Studies, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington.|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Breakfast is the meal most likely to be skipped, with only 40% of New Zealand children reporting eating breakfast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=NZ Food NZ Children: Key Results of the 2002 National Children’s Nutrition Survey.|last=Ministry of Health|publisher=Wellington: Ministry of Health.|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Health reported that found around 15% of children leave for school without having eaten breakfast, and that Maori and Pacific children were less likely to eat breakfast at home every day compared with other groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Portrait of Health-Key Results of the 2006/07 New Zealand Health Survey|last=Ministry of Health|publisher=|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breakfast can make a positive contribution to children’s learning. The positive social benefit seen in New Zealand have also been observed overseas (Wahlstrom &amp; Begalle, 1999). In Scotland, teachers report better attendance and better behaviour from children as a consequence of breakfast clubs there (Sheridan, 2001, para 17), and in its 2007 report to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCROC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.occ.org.nz/childrens-rights-and-advice/uncroc/|title=UNCROC|website=Office of the Children’s Commissioner|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Scottish government noted that new universal and subsidised school meal programmes in Scotland were improving children’s health and academic outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ofmdfmni.gov.uk|title=Home page of the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister|website=OFMDFM|access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clinical research''' is a branch of [[healthcare science]] that determines the safety and effectiveness ([[efficacy]]) of [[medications]], [[Medical device|devices]], [[diagnostics|diagnostic products]] and [[medical treatment|treatment regimens]] intended for human use. These may be used for prevention, treatment, diagnosis or for relieving symptoms of a disease. Clinical research is different from clinical practice. In clinical practice established treatments are used, while in clinical research evidence is collected to establish a treatment.

==Overview==
The term "clinical research" refers to the entire bibliography of a drug/device/biologic, in fact any test article from its inception in the lab to its introduction to the consumer market and beyond. Once the promising candidate or the molecule is identified in the lab, it is subjected to pre-clinical studies or animal studies where different aspects of the test article (including its safety [[toxicity]] if applicable and [[efficacy]], if possible at this early stage) are studied.&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, J.W. (2008). Educational research: Planning, conducting, and evaluating quantitative and qualitative research (3rd). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall. 2008, p. 300. {{ISBN|0-13-613550-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchmedics.com/ |title=Professional Medical Writing |accessdate=October 29, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6lcighdfv?url=http://researchmedics.com/ |archivedate=October 29, 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=news1309&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news-medical.net/whitepaper/20130916/Adaptive-Clinical-Trials-for-Overcoming-Research-Challenges.aspx |title=Adaptive Clinical Trials for Overcoming Research Challenges |publisher=News-medical.net |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], when a test article is unapproved or not yet cleared by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] ([[FDA]]), or when an approved or cleared test article is used in a way that may significantly increase the risks (or decreases the acceptability of the risks), the data obtained from the pre-clinical studies or other supporting evidence, case studies of off label use, etc. are submitted in support of an [[Investigational New Drug]] (IND) application&lt;ref&gt;FDA Page last updated 27 October 2014 [http://www.fda.gov/cder/regulatory/applications/ind_page_1.htm Investigational New Drug (IND) Application]&lt;/ref&gt; to the FDA for review prior to conducting studies that involve even one human and a test article if the results are intended to be submitted to or held for inspection by the FDA at any time in the future (in the case of an already approved test article, if intended to submit or hold for inspection by the FDA in support of a change in labeling or advertising). Where devices are concerned the submission to the FDA would be for an [[Investigational Device Exemption]] (IDE) application if the device is a significant risk device or is not in some way exempt from prior submission to the [[FDA]]. In addition, clinical research may require [[Institutional Review Board]] (IRB) or Research Ethics Board (REB) and possibly other institutional committee reviews, Privacy Board, Conflict of Interest Committee, Radiation Safety Committee, Radioactive Drug Research Committee, etc. approval whether or not the research requires prior submission to the FDA. Clinical research review criteria will depend on which federal regulations the research is subject to (e.g., ([[Department of Health and Human Services]] (DHHS) if federally funded, FDA as already discussed) and will depend on which regulations the institutions subscribe to, in addition to any more stringent criteria added by the institution possibly in response to state or local laws/policies or accreditation entity recommendations. This additional layer of review (IRB/REB in particular) is critical to the protection of human subjects especially when you consider that often research subject to the FDA regulation for prior submission is allowed to proceed, by those same FDA regulations, 30 days after submission to the FDA unless specifically notified by the FDA not to initiate the study.

Clinical research is often conducted at academic medical centers and affiliated research study sites. These centers and sites provide the prestige of the academic institution as well as access to larger metropolitan areas, providing a larger pool of medical participants. These academic medical centers often have their internal [[Institutional review board|Institutional Review Boards]] that oversee the ethical conduct of medical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mohamadi|first=Amin|last2=Asghari|first2=Fariba|last3=Rashidian|first3=Arash|date=2014|title=Continuing review of ethics in clinical trials: a surveillance study in Iran|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics and History of Medicine|volume=7|pages=22|pmc=4648212|pmid=26587202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The clinical research ecosystem involves a complex network of sites, pharmaceutical companies and academic research institutions. This has led to a growing field of technologies used for managing the data and operational factors of clinical research. Clinical research management is often aided by [[eClinical]] systems to help automate the management and conducting of [[clinical trials]].

In the [[European Union]], the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) acts in a similar fashion for studies conducted in their region. These human studies are conducted in four phases in research subjects that give [[consent]] to participate in the [[clinical trials]].

==Phases==
{{main|Phases of clinical research}}
Clinical trials involving new drugs are commonly classified into four phases. Each phase of the drug approval process is treated as a separate [[clinical trial]]. The drug-development process will normally proceed through all four phases over many years. If the drug successfully passes through Phases I, II, and III, it will usually be approved by the national regulatory authority for use in the general population. Phase IV are 'post-approval' studies.

Phase I includes 20 to 100 healthy volunteers or individuals with the disease/condition. This study typically lasts several months and its purpose is safety and dosage. Phase II includes larger number of individual participants ranging 100-300, and phase III includes Approximately 1000-3000 participants to collect more data about the drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nih.gov/health-information/nih-clinical-research-trials-you/basics|title=The Basics|website=National Institutes of Health|date=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 70% of drugs advance to the next phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/ForPatients/Approvals/Drugs/ucm405622.htm|title=The Drug Development Process|last=|first=|website=www.fda.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before pharmaceutical companies start clinical trials on a drug, they conduct extensive [[pre-clinical development|pre-clinical studies]].

'''Cultural competence in healthcare''' refers to the ability for [[healthcare professional]]s to demonstrate [[cultural competence]] toward patients with diverse [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]s, [[belief]]s, and feelings.&lt;ref name="TL"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cross|first1=TL|last2=Bazron|first2=BJ|last3=Dennis|first3=KW|last4=Isaacs|first4=MR|title=Towards a Culturally Competent System of Care: A Monograph on Effective Services for Minority Children Who Are Severely Emotionally Disturbed|journal=Georgetown University Child Development Center, CASSP Technical Assistance Center|date=March 1989|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED330171.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process includes consideration of the individual social, [[culture|cultural]], and [[feelings]] needs of patients for effective [[cross-cultural communication]] with their health care providers.&lt;ref name="betancourt"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Betancourt|first1=Joseph R.|last2=Green|first2=Alexander R.|last3=Carillo|first3=J. Emilio|title=Cultural competence in health care: emerging frameworks and practical approaches|date=October 2002|publisher=The Commonwealth Fund|location=New York, NY|url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/usr_doc/betancourt_culturalcompetence_576.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of cultural competence in health care is to reduce [[health disparity|health disparities]] and to provide optimal care to patients regardless of their [[race (human classification)|race]], [[gender]], [[ethnic background]], native languages spoken, and religious or cultural beliefs. [[Cultural competency training]] is important in health care fields where human interaction is common, including medicine, nursing, [[allied health]], mental health, social work, pharmacy, [[oral health]], and [[public health]] fields.

The term cultural competence was first used by Terry L. Cross and colleagues in 1989,&lt;ref name="TL"/&gt; but it was not until almost a decade later that health care professionals began to be formally educated and trained in cultural competence. In 2002, cultural competence in health care emerged as a field&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thackrah|first1=RD|last2=Thompson|first2=SC|title=Refining the concept of cultural competence: building on decades of progress|journal=The Medical Journal of Australia|date=8 July 2013|volume=199|issue=1|pages=35–38|url=https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2013/199/1/refining-concept-cultural-competence-building-decades-progress|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been increasingly embedded into medical education curriculum since then.

Although cultural competence in healthcare is a global concept,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goodman|first1=Neal R.|title=Cultural Competence in the Global Healthcare Industry|url=http://www.astd.org/Publications/Newsletters/ASTD-Links/ASTD-Links-Articles/2014/04/Cultural-Competence-in-the-Global-Healthcare-Industry|website=Association for Talent Development|accessdate=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is primarily practiced in the [[United States]].

==Definitions==
Cultural competence is defined as a set of congruent behaviors, [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s, and policies that come together in a system, agency, or among professionals and that enables them to work effectively in cross-cultural situations.&lt;ref name="TL" /&gt; Essential elements that enable organizations to become culturally competent include valuing [[cultural diversity|diversity]], having the capacity for cultural [[self-assessment]], being conscious of the dynamics inherent when cultures interact, having institutionalized cultural knowledge, and having developed adaptations to service delivery reflecting an understanding of cultural diversity.&lt;ref name="TL" /&gt; By definition, diversity includes differences in race, ethnicity, age, gender, size, religion, sexual orientation, and physical and mental ability.&lt;ref&gt;''The American Heritage® New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy''. (2005). Third Edition. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, organizations should include these considerations in all aspects of [[policy making]], administration, practice, and service delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conceptual Frameworks / Models, Guiding Values and Principles|url=http://nccc.georgetown.edu/foundations/frameworks.html#ccdefinition|website=National Center for Cultural Competence|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural competence involves more than having sensitivity or awareness of cultures. It necessitates an active process of learning and developing skills to engage effectively in cross-cultural situations and re-evaluating these skills over time.&lt;ref&gt;Office of Minority Health. (2002). ''Teaching cultural competence in health care: A review of current concepts, policies and practices''. Washington D.C.: U. S. Department of Health and Human Services. Contract Number: 282 - 98 - 0029.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural competence is often used interchangeably with the term cultural competency.

==Cultural competence in various settings==

===Healthcare system===
A healthcare system, sometimes referred to as health system, is the organization of people, institutions, and resources that deliver healthcare services to meet the health needs of target populations. A culturally competent health system not only recognizes and accepts the importance of cultural diversity at every level but also assesses the cross-cultural relations, stays vigilant towards any changes and developments resulting from cultural diversity, broadens cultural knowledge, and adapts services to meet the needs that are culturally-unique.&lt;ref name="TL" /&gt;

As more and more immigrants are coming to America, healthcare professionals with good cultural competence can use the knowledge and sensitivity that they obtain in order to provide holistic care for clients from other countries, who speak foreign languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilkinson |first1=Judith M. |last2=Treas |first2=Leslie S. |title=Fundamentals of Nursing |volume=1 |publisher=Davis Company |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The challenges for American healthcare systems to meet the health needs of the increasing number of diverse patients are becoming very obvious. The challenges include but are not limited to the following:&lt;ref name="TL" /&gt;&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/blogs/the-importance-of-cultural-competence-in-healthcare/| title=THE IMPORTANCE OF CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTHCARE| accessdate=25 November 2015| publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Obstacle#Biopsychosocial and cultural barriers|Sociocultural barriers]]
* Poor cross-cultural communication
* [[Language barrier]]s
* Attitudes toward healthcare
* Beliefs in diagnosis and treatment
* Lack of cultural competence in the design of the system

===Leadership and workforce===
In response to a rapid growth of [[minority group|minorities population]] in the United States, healthcare organizations have responded by providing new services and undergoing health reforms in terms of diversity in leadership and workforce. Despite improvements and progress seen in some areas, minorities are still underrepresented within both healthcare leadership and workforce.&lt;ref name="betancourt" /&gt; To improve the weak minorities representation in leadership and workforce, an organization must acknowledge the importance of cultures, be sensitive to cultural differences, and establish strategic plans to incorporate cultural diversity.

According to the national survey of the U.S. healthcare leaders conducted by the search firm [[Witt/Kieffer]], respondents viewed diverse leadership as a valuable business builder. They associated it with improved patient satisfaction, successful decision-making, improved clinical outcomes, and stronger bottom line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Witt/Kieffer|title=Building the Business Case - Healthcare Diversity Leadership: a National Survey Report|date=2011|url=http://www.wittkieffer.com/file/thought-leadership/practice/Diversity%20as%20a%20business%20builder_2011.pdf|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To successfully recruit, mentor, and coach minority leaders in healthcare, it is important to keep these social science principles and cultural values in mind:&lt;ref&gt;Rich VL. Advancing diversity leadership in health care. ''Nursing administration quarterly''. Jul-Sep 2013;37(3):269-271.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Brand]]ing - how health care leaders brand diversity in their organizations? Without inclusion, branding would not be complete
* The concepts of self-categorization and "othering"
* Lack of leadership commitment - diversity and inclusion should be an imperative of their organization
* The compelling national demographics of healthcare leadership and workforce.

===Clinical practice===
To provide culturally sensitive patient-centered care, physicians should treat each patient as an individual, recognizing and respecting his or her beliefs, values and care seeking behaviors.&lt;ref name="like1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Like|first1=RCL|last2=Barrett|first2=TJ|last3=Moon|first3=J|title=Educating Physicians to Provide Culturally Competent, Patient-Centered Care|journal=Perspectives: A View of Family Medicine in New Jersey|date=Summer 2008|volume=7|issue=2|pages=10–20|url=http://www.ncsl.org/documents/health/NJAFPHandout52013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many physicians lack the awareness of or training in cultural competence. With the constantly changing [[demographic]]s, their patients are increasingly getting diverse as well. It is utterly important to educate physicians to be culturally competent so that they can effectively treat patients of different cultural and ethnic backgrounds. 

Implicit bias aimed towards certain races or ethnicities is frequent in the healthcare field, specifically in the United States, commonly with Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, and American Indians&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2015.302903|title=Implicit Racial/Ethnic Bias Among Health Care Professionals and Its Influence on Health Care Outcomes: A Systematic Review|last=Hall, Chapman, et al.|first=|date=November 6, 2015|website=American Public Health Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Subconscious discrimination occurs regardless of the advancement of disease prevention in the United States, as shown by the significantly high mortality rates of the groups mentioned earlier in the paragraph&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. This discrimination is shaped by attitudes of healthcare professionals, who often differ in effort and type of treatment based on the race and physical appearance of a patient. Carrying over to the diagnosis and treatment of minority patients, the disparities in quality of healthcare increase the likelihood of developing diseases such as asthma, HIV/AIDs and other life-threatening diseases&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. For example, a study that focused on the treatment and diagnosis differences between black women and white women in regards to breast cancer indicated this discrimination against minorities and its effects&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunt, Whitman, Hurlbert|first=|date=March 2014|title=Increasing Black: White disparities in breast cancer mortality in the 50 largest cities in the United States|url=https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1877782113001513/1-s2.0-S1877782113001513-main.pdf?_tid=4224b31c-57f1-4040-b9d4-1a5dd67b475a&amp;acdnat=1539583937_26652ad07c2cd98be15e03c429be0f25|journal=The International Journal of Cancer Epidemiology, Detection, and Prevention|volume=|pages=|via=Elsevier ScienceDirect}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Furthermore, the study indicated that "white women are more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer, [and] Black women are more likely to die from it."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  

The differences in responses from healthcare professionals to black patients versus white patients is drastic, indicated by subconscious negative perceptions of various races.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blair, Steiner, et al.|first=|date=January 2013|title=Clinicians' Implicit Ethnic/Racial Bias and Perceptions of Care Among Black and Latino Patients|url=https://www.clinicalkey.com/#!/content/playContent/1-s2.0-S1544170913600086|journal=ClinicalKey|volume=11|pages=43-52|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study that evaluated physicians' immediate assumptions made about different races "two-thirds of the clinicians subconsciously formed a bias against Blacks (43% moderate to strong) and Latinos (51% moderate to strong)".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Without intentionally concocting stereotypes about patients, these clinicians are indirectly negatively affecting the patients they mistreat. To remedy this, the study expresses support for clinicians to form a stronger connection with each patient and to focus on the patient at hand, rather than considering their race or background. This will help to prevent negative attitudes and tones when speaking with patients, creating a positive atmosphere that allows for equal environments and treatments for all patients, regardless of race or physical appearance&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;.  

In response to the increasingly diverse population, several states ([[Washington (state)|WA]], [[California|CA]], [[Connecticut|CT]], [[New Jersey|NJ]], [[New Mexico|NM]]) have passed legislation requiring or strongly recommending cultural competency training for physicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CLAS Legislation Map|url=https://www.thinkculturalhealth.hhs.gov/Content/LegislatingCLAS.asp|website=Think Cultural Health|publisher=Office of Minority Health|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, New Jersey legislature enacted a law requiring all physicians to complete at least 6 hours of training in cultural competency as a condition for renewal of their New Jersey [[medical license]], whether or not they actively practice in New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NJ Cultural Competency|url=http://www.state.nj.us/lps/ca/bme/press/cultural.htm|website=Office of Attorney General|publisher=New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians' responses to this CME requirement varied, both positively and negatively. But the overall feedback was positive towards the outcomes of participation in and satisfaction with the programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Like|first1=Robert C.|title=Educating clinicians about cultural competence and disparities in health and health care|journal=Journal of Continuing Education in the Health Professions|date=23 Sep 2011|volume=31|issue=3|pages=196–206|doi=10.1002/chp.20127}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 August 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to provide culturally competent care for their diverse patients, physicians should at the first step understand that patients' cultures can influence profoundly how they define health and illness, how they seek health care, and what constitutes appropriate treatment. They should also realize that their clinical care process could also be influenced by their own personal and professional experiences as well as biomedical culture.&lt;ref name="like1"/&gt; Dr. Like pointed out in one of his articles that "in transforming systems, transcultural nurses, physicians, and other health care professionals need to remember that cultural humility and cultural competence must go hand in hand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Like|first1=Robert C.|title=Culturally Competent Managed Health Care: A Family Physician’s Perspective|journal=Journal of Transcultural Nursing|date=October 1999|volume=10|issue=4|pages=288–289|doi=10.1177/104365969901000403}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 August 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
Cultural competence in research is the ability of researchers and research staff to provide high quality research that takes into account the culture and diversity of a population when developing research ideas, design, and methodology. Cultural competence can be crucial for ensuring that the [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]] is representative of the population and therefore application to a diverse number of people.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. (2001). ''Mental health: Culture, race, and ethnicity-A supplement to Mental health: A report of the Surgeon General''. Rockville, MD: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Center for Mental Health Service.&lt;/ref&gt; It is important that a study's subject enrollment reflect as closely as possible the target population of those affected by the health problem being studied.

In 1994, the National Institutes of Health established policy (Public Law 103-43) for the inclusion of women, children, and members of minority groups and their subpopulations in biomedical and behavioral clinical studies.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. (2010). ''Human Subjects Protection and Inclusion of Women, Minorities, and Children Guidelines for Review of NIH Grant Applications''. p. 1. Retrieved 11 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Overcoming challenges to cultural competence in research also means that [[institutional review board]] membership should include representatives of large communities and cultural groups as representatives.

===Medical education===
The critical importance of training medical students to be future culturally competent physicians has been recognized by accrediting bodies such as the [[Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education]]&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Jacques H. Ambrose, Susan Y. Lin, and Maria B. J. Chun (2013) ''Cultural Competency Training Requirements in Graduate Medical Education''. Journal of Graduate Medical Education: June 2013, Vol. 5, No. 2, pp. 227-231.&lt;/ref&gt; (ACGME) and the [[Liaison Committee on Medical Education]] (LCME) and other medical organizations such as [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) and the [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM).

Culture is definitely beyond ethnicity and race. Healthcare professionals need to learn about the tolerance of other's beliefs. Professional care is about meeting patients' needs even if they do not align with the caretaker's personal beliefs. Discovering one's own beliefs and their origin (from upbringing or modeling of parents, for example) helps understand what is believed and moderates actions at times when others are cared for with different beliefs. As a result, it is essential for healthcare professionals to practice cultural competence and recognize the differences as well as cultural sensitivities to provide holistic care for the patients.

According to the LCME standard for cultural competence, "the faculty and students must demonstrate an understanding of the manner in which people of diverse culture and belief systems perceive health and illness and respond to various symptoms, diseases, and treatments."&lt;ref&gt;Liaison Committee on Medical Education. ''Functions and structure of a medical school: standards for accreditation of medical education programs leading to the M.D. degree.'' Washington, D.C.: Association of American Medical Colleges; 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the mandates, medical schools in the U.S. have incorporated teaching cultural competency in their curricula. A search on cultural competency in the curriculum of a medical school revealed that it was covered in 33 events in 13 courses in spring 2014. A similar search was performed on health disparities yielding 16 events in 10 courses covering the topic.

The cultural competence curriculum is intended to improve the interaction between patients and physicians and to assure that students will possess the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that enable them to provide high quality and culturally competent care to patients and their families as well as the general medical community.&lt;ref&gt;American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC). ''Cultural competence education for medical students''. Washington, DC: AAMC; 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

A "visual intervention" was completed to educate healthcare professionals on the dangers of subconscious discrimination toward minority groups in order to lessen the common discrimination certain races or ethnicities face in a healthcare setting&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lightfoot, Chapman, Colby, et al.|first=|date=February 2015|title=Envisioning Health: A Trans-disciplinary, Community-Engaged Visual Intervention for Healthcare Providers on Implicit Bias Toward Latino/ a Immigrant Youth|url=https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(14)00609-0/abstract|journal=Journal of Adolescent Health|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This study allowed for physicians to focus more on the problems of their patients, and truly listening to their issues&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. By creating a supportive space that fosters a strong channel of communication, the study targeted the lack of connection between healthcare professionals and patients due to either language barriers or the patient's mistrust in the professional&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

===Patient education===
[[Doctor–patient relationship|Patient-Physician communication]] involves two sides. While physicians and other healthcare providers are being encouraged or required to be culturally competent in delivery of quality healthcare, it would be reasonable to encourage patients as well to be culturally sensitive and be aware that not all health care providers are equally competent in cultures. When it comes to illness, cultural beliefs and values affect greatly a patient's behavior in seeking healthcare. They should try their best to communicate their concerns relating to their beliefs, values and other cultural factors that might affect care and treatment to their physicians and other healthcare providers. If effective communication is unlikely achieved, then they should be provided with language assistance and interpretation services. Recognizing that patients receive the best care when they work in partnership with doctors, the [[General Medical Council]] issued guidance for patients "What to expect from your doctor: a guide for patients" in April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/patients.asp |title=What to expect from your doctor: a guide for patients |publisher=[[General Medical Council]] |accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmc-uk.org/news/21839.asp |title=Press release: GMC publishes first guide for patients on what to expect from their doctor |publisher=General Medical Council |date=22 April 2013 |accessdate=9 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228095906/http://www.gmc-uk.org/news/21839.asp |archivedate=28 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges to cultural competence==

===Language barriers===
[[Linguistic competence]] involves communicating effectively with diverse populations, including individuals with [[limited English proficiency]] (LEP), low [[literacy|literacy skill]]s or are not literate, disabilities, and individuals with any degree of [[hearing loss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goode|first1=Tawara D.|last2=Jones|first2=Wendy|title=Definition of Linguistic Competence|url=http://nccc.georgetown.edu/documents/Definition%20of%20Linguistic%20Competence.pdf|website=National Center for Cultural Competence|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the U.S. Census in 2011, 25.3 million people are considered limited English proficient, accounting for 9% of the U.S. population. Hospitals frequently admit LEP patients for treatment. With cultural and linguistic barriers, it is not surprising that it is hard to achieve effective communication between the health care providers and the LEP patients.

In order to improve communication and mutual understanding, health care systems have used the professionally trained interpreters to help [[health care provider]]s to communicate with patients whose English proficiency is limited. Studies have shown that trained professional interpreters or bilingual health care professionals have a positive effect on LEP patients' satisfaction, their quality of care, and outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Flores G. The impact of medical interpreter services on the quality of health care: a systematic review. ''Medical care research and review : MCRR''. Jun 2005;62(3):255-299.&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services (CLAS) Standards in Health and Health Care developed by the [[Office of Minority Health]] (OMH) are intended to advance health equity, improve quality and help eliminate health care disparities.&lt;ref&gt;The Office of Minority Health (OMH). ''National Standards on Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services (CLAS)'' - 2013; http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/templates/browse.aspx?lvl=2&amp;lvlID=15. Accessed July 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The three themes of the fifteen CLAS standards areGovernance, Leadership, and workforce; Communication and Language Assistance; and Engagement, Continuous Improvement, and Accountability. The standards clearly emphasized that the top levels of an organizational leadership hold the responsibility for CLAS implementation,  and that language assistance should be provided when needed, and quality improvement, community engagement, and evaluation are importance.&lt;ref&gt;Koh HK, Gracia JN, Alvarez ME. Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services–advancing health with CLAS. "The New England Journal of Medicine". Jul 17 2014;371(3):198-201.&lt;/ref&gt; that is a very good resource for healthcare systems and organizations to follow to become culturally and linguistically competent in the delivery of health care.

The '''fathers' rights movement''' is a movement whose members are primarily interested in issues related to [[family law]], including [[child custody]] and [[child support]] that affect fathers and their [[child]]ren.&lt;ref name=Collier2006&gt;[[#FRALR|Collier &amp; Sheldon]], 2006, p. 1–26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=collier&gt;{{cite news |last1=Collier |first1=R. |last2=Sheldon |first2=S. |title=Unfamiliar territory: The issue of a father's rights and responsibilities covers more than just the media-highlighted subject of access to his children |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=2006-11-01 |url=http://society.guardian.co.uk/children/story/0,,1935970,00.html |accessdate=2007-10-17 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080520124643/http://society.guardian.co.uk/children/story/0%2C%2C1935970%2C00.html |archivedate=20 May 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of its members are fathers who desire to share the parenting of their children equally with their children's mothers—either after [[divorce]] or as unwed fathers—and the children of the terminated marriage. The movement includes men as well as women, often the second wives of divorced fathers or other family members of men who have had some engagement with [[family law]].&lt;ref name=Collier2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=kaye&gt;{{cite journal | last =Kaye | first =Miranda |last2=Tolmie |first2=Julia | title =Fathers' Rights Groups in Australia and their Engagement with Issues in Family Law | journal =Australian Journal of Family Law | volume =12 | pages = 19–68 | year =1998 | url =http://sisyphe.org/IMG/doc/doc-656.doc |accessdate=2007-03-24 |format=Doc}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="crowley"/&gt;

Most of its members had little prior interest in the law or politics. However, as they felt that their goal of equal-shared parenting was being frustrated by the family courts, many took an interest in family law, including child custody and child support.&lt;ref name=Collier2006/&gt;&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Many Women in Civil Rights Movement"/&gt;

The movement has received international press coverage as a result of high-profile activism of their members.&lt;ref name=Collier2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt; It has become increasingly vocal, visible and organised, and has played a powerful role in family law debates.&lt;ref name=Collier2006 /&gt;

The fathers' rights movement has both liberal and conservative branches, with different viewpoints about how men and women compare. Although both groups agree on the victimization and discrimination against men, they disagree on why men and women differ ([[nature versus nurture]]) and traditional [[gender role]]s. The liberal version believes the differences between the sexes are due to culture and supports equality between men and women; in contrast, the conservative branch believes in traditional [[patriarchy|patriarchal]]/[[Complementarianism|complementary]] families and that the differences [[Gender differences|between genders are due to biology]].&lt;ref name="williams2"&gt;{{cite book | last = Williams | first =GI | title = Historical and Multicultural Encyclopedia of Women's Reproductive Rights in the United States | publisher = [[Greenwood Press]] | year = 2002| pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZKVzULJ–764C&amp;pg=PA81 81–83] | chapter = Fathers' Rights Movement|isbn=978-0-313-30644-0|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gavanas04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{cite book | last = Williams | first = GI |last2=Williams |first2=RH | title = Social Problems: Constructionist Readings | editor-last = Loseke |editor-first=DR |editor-last2=Best |editor-first2=J | publisher = Aldine Transaction | year = 2003 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=BXIspcMwljIC&amp;pg=PA93 93–100] | chapter = Framing in the Fathers' Rights Movement | isbn = 978-0-202-30703-9 | url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross Parke and Armin Brott view the fathers' rights movement as one of three strands within the [[men's movement]] that deal almost exclusively with fatherhood, the other two being the good fathers' movement and groups forming the Christian Men's movement – the [[Promise Keepers]] being the largest.&lt;ref name=Parke1999&gt;[[#Parke1999|Parke]], 1999, p.

[[Warren Farrell]], a veteran of the women's, men's and fathers' movement since the 1970s, describes the fathers' rights movement as part of a larger "gender transition movement" and thinks that, similar to women in the 1960s, fathers are transitioning from gender-based to more flexible family roles. Farrell also believes the movement helps children by increasing the number who are raised equally by both parents, which in turn increases the children's social, academic, psychological, and physical benefits—in his opinion it becomes a [[children's rights]] issue with fathers acting as advocates.&lt;ref name=Farrell2001/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2010}}

Fathers' rights groups also provide emotional and practical support for members during separation and divorce.&lt;ref name=Collier2006/&gt;

Some fathers' rights groups have become frustrated with the slow pace of traditional campaigning for law reform; groups such as the originally UK-based ''[[Fathers 4 Justice]]'' have become increasingly vocal and visible, undertaking public demonstrations that have attracted public attention and influenced the politics of family justice.&lt;ref name=fralr3/&gt; Following protests, some fathers' rights activists have been convicted of offenses such as harassment and assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

[[Stephen Baskerville]] is an associate professor of political science, president of the [[American Coalition of Fathers and Children]] and fathers' rights advocate and defines court-determined custody as not a right to parent one's children but as the power to prevent the other partner from parenting.&lt;ref name=Baskerville&gt;[[#Baskerville 2007|Baskerville]], 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the fathers' rights movement state that family courts are biased against fathers and shared custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Select Committee on Constitutional Affairs Fourth Report | publisher = House of Commons, Parliament UK | date = 2005-02-23 | url = https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmconst/116/116we23.htm | accessdate = 2007-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Operation of the Family Courts | publisher = House of Commons Constitutional Affairs Committee Family Justice | date = 2004-11-08 | format = pdf | url = https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmconst/116/116ii.pdf | accessdate = 2007-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Baskerville states that the outcome of divorce is overly one-sided and is initiated by mothers in more than two-thirds of cases – especially when children are involved.

Members of the fathers' rights movement and their critics disagree about the correlation of negative developmental outcomes for children to sole custody situations. Social scientist V. C. McLoyd states that father absence covaries with other relevant family characteristics such as the lack of an income from a male adult, the absence of a second adult, and the lack of support from a second extended family system and conclude that it is the negative effects of poverty, and not the absence of a father, that result in negative developmental outcomes.&lt;ref name="Father Absent Homes"&gt;{{cite journal | last = McLoyd |first=VC | title = Socioeconomic disadvantage and child development | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 53 | issue = 2 | pages = 185–204 |date=February 1998 | pmid = 9491747 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.53.2.185 | url = http://content.apa.org/journals/amp/53/2/185}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Professor Craig Hart states that although the consequences of poverty and having a single parent are interrelated, each is a risk factor with independent effects on children,&lt;ref name="Shared Parenting Research"&gt;{{cite web | last = Hart | first = CH | title = Combating the Myth that Parents Don't Matter | publisher = The Howard Center for Family Religion and Society | year = 1999 | url = http://www.worldcongress.org/wcf2_spkrs/wcf2_hart.htm | accessdate = 2007-03-28 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070211235613/http://www.worldcongress.org/wcf2_spkrs/wcf2_hart.htm | archivedate = 11 February 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Silverstein and Auerbach state that the negative outcomes for children in sole custody situations correlate more strongly to "fatherlessness" than to any other variable including poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Deconstructing the Essential Father | publisher = SPARC | url = http://www.deltabravo.net/custody/deconstruct.php | accessdate = 2007-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Is there really a fatherhood crisis?"/&gt;

Stephen Baskerville states that shared parenting has been demonstrated to reduce parental conflict by requiring parents to cooperate and compromise, and that it is the lack of constraint by one parent resulting from the ability of that parent to exclude the other, that results in increased parental conflict.&lt;ref name="Taken Into Custody 305"&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Seltzer |first=Judith | title = Father by Law: Effects of Joint Legal Custody on Nonresident Fathers' Involvement With Children | journal = Demography | volume = 35| issue = 2 | date = May 1998 | pmid = 9622777 | pages = 135–46 | doi=10.2307/3004047}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further states that only when child support guidelines exceed true costs do parents ask for or seek to prevent changes in parenting time for financial reasons, adding that any argument that a parent is asking for increased parenting time to reduce child support is at the same time an argument that the other parent is making a profit from child support.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report | title = Child Cost Economics and Litigation Issues: An Introduction to Applying Cost Shares Child Support Guidelines | author = R.

Stephen Baskerville describes no-fault or unilateral divorce based on no fault as a power grab by the parent that initiates the divorce and he also states that fathers have a constitutional right to shared control of their children and through political action they intend to establish parental authority for both parents and for the well-being of their children.&lt;ref name="Divorced From Reality"&gt;{{cite web | title = Divorced From Reality | publisher = [[Touchstone (magazine)|Touchstone]] | date = January 2009 | url=http://touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=22-01-019-f | accessdate = 2010-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parental Authority"&gt;{{cite web |author=Stephen Baskerville | title = Fathers' Rights Are Fathers' Duties | publisher = FatherMag.Com | date = 1998–2000 | url = http://www.fathermag.com/803/action/ | accessdate = 2007-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the fathers' rights movement state that a rebuttable presumption for shared parenting preserves a child's protection against unfit or violent parents.&lt;ref name="F&amp;F Position Paper"&gt;{{cite web | title = Position Paper of Fathers &amp; Families | publisher = Fathers &amp; Families | year = 2007 | url = http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/Publications/Legislation/2007_HB1460_SB994_Position_Paper_Shared_Parenting.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-10-06 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071028142738/http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/Publications/Legislation/2007_HB1460_SB994_Position_Paper_Shared_Parenting.pdf | archivedate = 28 October 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pro-feminist]] sociologist [[Michael Flood]] states that supporters of shared parenting use it only as a symbolic issue related to "rights", "equality", and "fairness" and that the father's rights movement is not actually interested in the shared care of their children or the children's wishes, adding that fathers' rights groups have advocated policies and strategies that are harmful to mothers and children and also harmful to the fathers themselves.&lt;ref name="flood"&gt;{{cite conference | first = M | last = Flood | title = Separated Fathers and the Fathers' Rights Movement | booktitle = Feminism, Law and the Family Workshop | publisher = Law School, University of Melbourne | date =  | url = http://www.xyonline.net/downloads/Supportingseparatedfath.doc | format = DOC | accessdate = 2007-03-12 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070207223803/http://www.xyonline.net/downloads/Supportingseparatedfath.doc | archivedate = 7 February 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, social scientist [[Sanford Braver]] states that the bad divorced dad image is a myth that has led to harmful and dangerous social policies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child support===
{{See also|Child support|paternity fraud}}
Members of the fathers' rights movement campaign for the reform of child support guidelines, which in most Western countries are based on maintaining the children's standard of living after separation, and on the assumption that the children live with one parent and never with the other.&lt;ref name="Fathers Are Capable Too - Comments on Child Support Guidelines"&gt;{{cite web | title = Comments on the Child Support Guidelines | publisher = F.A.C.T.

Morgan has stated that it focuses on the relative living standards of divorcing parents rather than the best interests of the children and financially supporting them at the same level after divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Morgan | first = LW | title = The "Cost Share" model of child support guidelines | date = 2005-02-15 | url = http://www.supportguidelines.com/articles/art200407.html | accessdate = 2007-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solangel Maldonado states that the law should value a broader definition of fathering for poor fathers by reducing the focus on collecting child support and encouraging the informal contributions (such as groceries, clothes, toys, time with the children) of these fathers by counting these contributions as child support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Maldonado | first = S | title = Deadbeat or Deadbroke: Redefining Child Support for Poor Fathers | year = 2006 | url = http://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/Vol39/Issue3/DavisVol39No3_MALDONADO.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-06-21 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090306021547/http://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/Vol39/Issue3/DavisVol39No3_MALDONADO.pdf | archivedate = 6 March 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the fathers' rights movement state that child support should be terminated under certain conditions, such as if the custodial parent limits access to the children by moving away against the wishes of the other parent, gives fraudulent testimony, or if paternity fraud is discovered,&lt;ref name="Recommendations for Child Support Guideline Revisement"&gt;{{cite web | title = Recommendations for Child Support Guideline Revisement June 2001 | date = June 2001 | url = http://www.fatherhoodcoalition.org/cpf/2001/CSGuidelineRecommendations2001.htm | accessdate = 2007-04-15 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070406095103/http://fatherhoodcoalition.org/cpf/2001/CSGuidelineRecommendations2001.htm | archive-date = 6 April 2007 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; adding that two men should not have to pay child support for the same child.&lt;ref name="Fathers Are Capable Too - Comments on Child Support Guidelines"/&gt;

Stephen Baskerville states that it is often difficult for fathers in financial hardship or who take on a larger caregiving role with their children to have their child support payments lowered. He also states that unemployment is the primary cause of child support arrears, and further states that these arrearages make the father subject to arrest and imprisonment without due process.&lt;ref name="Is there really a fatherhood crisis?"&gt;{{cite web | last = Baskerville | first = S | title = Is There Really A Fatherhood Crisis? | publisher = The Independent Institute | year = 2004 | url = http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?issueID=13&amp;articleID=35 | accessdate = 2007-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Baskerville states that the purpose of child support should be publicly determined, and enforcement programs must be designed to serve that purpose, observing the due process of law.&lt;ref name=Baskerville2007298/&gt;

Supporters of the fathers' rights movement assert that some women make false claims of domestic violence, sexual or child abuse in order to gain an upper hand in divorce, custody disputes and/or prevent fathers from seeing their children, and they state that lawyers advise women to make such claims.&lt;ref name="gavanas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fatherphobia"/&gt; They state that false claims of domestic violence and child abuse are encouraged by the inflammatory "win or lose" nature of child custody hearings, that men are presumed to be guilty rather than innocent by police and by the courts,&lt;ref name="Recommendations for Child Support Guideline Revisement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Controlling DV Against Men"&gt;{{cite web | title = Controlling Domestic Violence Against Men|last1=Corry|first1=CE|last2=Fiebert|first2= MS|last3=Pizzey|first3= E| publisher = Equal Justice Foundation | year = 2002 | url = http://www.ejfi.org/DV/dv-9.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawyers and advocates for abused women assert that family court proceedings are commonly accompanied with allegations of domestic violence because of the prevalence of domestic violence in society rather than as a result of false allegations of domestic violence. They also assert that domestic violence often begins or increases around the time of divorce or separation.&lt;ref name=" Ottaman"/&gt; Academic critic, Michael Flood, argues that fathers' rights groups have had a damaging impact on the field of domestic violence programming and policy by attempting to discredit female victims of violence, to wind back the legal protections available to victims and the sanctions imposed on perpetrators, and to undermine services for the victims of men's violence.&lt;ref name="Flood"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Flood | first = Michael | year = 2010 | title = ‘Fathers' Rights' and the Defense of Paternal Authority in Australia | journal = Violence Against Women | publisher = Sage | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 328–347 | url = http://www.xyonline.net/content/fathers-rights-and-defence-paternal-authority-australia | doi=10.1177/1077801209360918}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Baskerville asserts that when child abuse occurs the perpetrator is not likely to be the father, and that child abuse most often occurs after the father has been separated from his children.&lt;ref name="Divorce as revolution"/&gt; Baskerville proposes that domestic violence and child abuse must be adjudicated as criminal assault, observing due process protections, and that government funding for programs addressing these issues must be made contingent on such protections.&lt;ref name=Baskerville2007298/&gt;

===Parenting time interference===

[[Glenn Sacks]] states that some mothers interfere with the father's parenting time and that such interference should be stopped.&lt;ref name="Parenting Time Interference a problem for dads"&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Thompson | first1 = D | last2 = Sacks | first2 = G | title = Equal Parents Week Highlights Need for Family Court Reform | publisher = GlennSacks.Com | date = 2002-09-26 | url = http://glennsacks.com/equal_parents_week_pf.htm | accessdate = 2007-03-15 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061214213644/http://www.glennsacks.com/equal_parents_week_pf.htm | archivedate = 14 December 2006 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sacks and [[Jeffery M.

Fathers' rights activists have also advocated for the inclusion of parental alienation syndrome, a proposed syndrome developed by [[Richard A. Gardner]] that alleges unjustified disruption of the relationship between a parent and a child is caused by the other parent.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Stephen Baskerville]] states that laws establishing no-fault divorce did not stop at removing the requirement that grounds be cited for a divorce, so as to allow for divorce by "mutual consent"; it also allows either spouse to end the marriage without any agreement or fault by the other.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phyllis Schlafly]] states that no-fault divorce should be referred to as unilateral divorce.&lt;ref name=Keynote&gt;{{cite web | title = Phyllis Schlafly's keynote address | publisher = [[American Coalition of Fathers and Children]] | year = 2006 | url = http://www.acfc.org/media/video/2006nflrc/ka/ka-schlafly.wmv | format = wmv | last = Schlafly | first = P | authorlink = Phyllis Schlafly | accessdate = 2007-05-12 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926002543/http://www.acfc.org/media/video/2006nflrc/ka/ka-schlafly.wmv | archivedate = 26 September 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Baskerville states that laws establishing no-fault divorce can be seen as one of the boldest social experiments in modern history that have effectively ended marriage as a legal contract.&lt;ref name=Baskerville200746&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; He states that it is not possible to form a binding agreement to create a family, adding that government officials can, at the request of one spouse, end a marriage over the objection of the other.&lt;ref name=Baskerville200746/&gt; He states that no-fault divorce has left fathers with no protection against what he describes as the confiscation of their children.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p.44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Baskerville states that fault has entered through the back door in the form of child custody hearings, and that the forcibly divorced spouse ("defendant") is presumed guilty.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p. 76–77.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, other members of the fathers' rights movement believe that men fail to get appropriate recognition of their innocence as a result of no-fault divorce.&lt;ref name=kaye/&gt; Baskerville describes a proposed amendment of no-fault divorce laws that would create a [[rebuttable presumption]] that custody of any minor children be awarded to the respondent [who is innocent or does not wish to divorce] regardless of gender. He also notes the predictions of Tim O'Brien, the author of the proposed amendment, who states that the proposed amendment would result in a plummeting divorce rate and reduced negative consequences for children.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Baskerville proposes "reasonable limits" on no-fault divorce when children are involved.&lt;ref name=Baskerville2007298&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of the FRM support the end of the no-fault principle in child custody and divorce decisions.&lt;ref name=kaye/&gt;&lt;ref name="khader"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Khader | first = Serene J. | date = October–December 2008 | title = When Equality Justifies Women's Subjection: Luce Irigaray's Critique of Equality and the Fathers' Rights Movement | journal = Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy | publisher = Indiana University Press | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 48–74 | doi = 10.2979/HYP.2008.23.4.48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Cheltenham"&gt;{{cite web | title = Restoring Control over matrimonial and family law | date = September 2004 | url = http://www.ukmm.org.uk/publics/rcomfl/report.htm | publisher = The Cheltenham Group | accessdate = 2008-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of the fathers' rights movement state that the availability of divorce should also be limited.&lt;ref name=kaye/&gt;

===Government involvement===
Stephen Baskerville states that governments throughout the United States and other democracies are engaged, by accident or design, in a campaign against fathers and fatherhood, which in his view, lies at the root of a larger problem that threatens marriage, destroys families, devastates the lives of many children, and undermines [[parents]], [[democracy]] and [[accountability]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, pp. 18, 268, 287.&lt;/ref&gt; Baskerville also states that it is the removal of the father from the family through divorce that initiates problems for which the government is perceived as the solution rather than the problem, and that these problems are then used to justify the continued existence and expansion of the government.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the fathers' rights movement state that modern divorce involves government officials invading parents' private lives, evicting people from their homes, seizing their property, and taking away their children.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gavanas | first = A | title = Making Men Into Fathers: Men, Masculinities and the Social Politics of Fatherhood | year = 2002 | editor-last = Hobson | editor-first = B | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8ZHeEA4syMUC&amp;pg=PA220 |page=220 | isbn = 0-511-02952-7 | chapter = The Fatherhood Responsibility Movement: the centrality of marriage, work and male sexuality in reconstructions of masculinity and fatherhood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parental and reproductive rights===
{{Main|Parents' rights movement}}
Fathers' rights advocates have worked for the right of unwed, otherwise fit, fathers to get custody if the mother tries to have their child [[adoption|adopted]] by a third party or if child welfare authorities place the child in [[foster care]].&lt;ref name="williams2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shanley"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shanley |first=Mary Lyndon |title=Making babies, making families: what matters most in an age of reproductive technologies, surrogacy, adoption, and same-sex and unwed parents|publisher=Beacon Press |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3GnloZRnWOAC&amp;pg=PA44 |pages=46–47 |isbn=0-8070-4409-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fathers' rights activists seek a gender-neutral approach in which unwed men and women would have equal rights in adoption issues, an approach that critics state does not sufficiently acknowledge the different biological roles in procreation and pregnancy, and the disparity in society's social and economic structures.&lt;ref name="shanley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-415-91027-7"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fineman |first=Martha |title=The neutered mother, the sexual family, and other twentieth century tragedies |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=1995 |isbn=0-415-91027-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2016}} In the US, some states have passed laws to protect the rights of unwed fathers to custody. Courts have increasingly supported these rights, though judges often require evidence that the father has shown interest in, and given financial and emotional support to, the mother during pregnancy.&lt;ref name="williams2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn1-59337-369-4"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Godwin |first=Raymond |last2=Beauvais-Godwin |first2=Laura |title=The Complete Adoption Book: Everything You Need to Know to Adopt a Child |publisher=Adams Media Corporation |location=Avon, MA |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=n0BIlzqdvMEC&amp;pg=PA96 |pages=96–97 |isbn=1-59337-369-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some fathers' rights advocates have sought the right to prevent women from having an [[abortion]] without the father's consent, on the basis that it is discriminatory for men not to have the ability to participate in a decision to terminate a pregnancy.&lt;ref name="williams2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-7614-7907-4"&gt;{{cite book |publisher =Marshall Cavendish Corporation |title=Sex and Society Volume 2 |author =Marshall Cavendish |year=2009 |isbn=0-7614-7907-4 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=YtsxeWE7VD0C&amp;pg=PA596 |page=596}}&lt;/ref&gt; This option is not supported by any laws in the United States.&lt;ref name=Buchanan2007/&gt; Fathers' rights advocates Jeffrey M. Leving and [[Glenn Sacks]] have stated that "choice for men is a flawed solution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalledger.com/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi?archive=3&amp;num=7589 |title=Respect a Man's Choice, Too |last1=Leving |first1=Jeffery M. |last2=Sacks |first2=Glenn |date=9 August 2006|publisher=National Ledger |accessdate=2010-06-06 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates have also expressed the desire to have a [[Male abortion|"financial abortion"]] in which the option exists to sever all responsibility for child support for an unwanted child. Commenting on this, legal scholar Kim Buchanan states, "The only way men's lack of a pregnancy opt-out can be framed as a gender injustice is to accept that men have a right to visit the consequences of unprotected sex (or contraceptive failure) exclusively on their female partners."&lt;ref name=Buchanan2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buchanan|first=KS|title=Lawrence v.

===Parental leave===
{{Main|Paternity leave}}
Pressure from father's rights groups, among others, have in several countries resulted in gender-neutral program(s) eligible for parental leave. While historically, maternity benefits were given to mothers based on the physical biology of childbirth, including the need to protect the health and financial well-being of the woman and child, parental leave benefits emphasize gender-neutral child-rearing, the benefits of the participation of fathers in children's care, and redress discrimination against men who wish to be involved with their infants.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Maureen, Parental Benefit Policies and the Gendered Division of Labor The Social Service Review, Vol. 71, No. 1 (March 1997), pp. 51–71 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30012606]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-7391-0688-0"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reese |first1=Laura A. |last2=Gottfried |first2=Heidi |title=Equity in the workplace: gendering workplace policy analysis |publisher=Lexington Books |location=Lexington, Mass |year=2004 |pages= 187–88|isbn=0-7391-0688-0 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dK5p625del8C&amp;pg=PA187 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terminology===
Some fathers' rights activists object to the term "visitation", which they see as denigrating to their level of authority as parents, and instead prefer the use of "parenting time".&lt;ref&gt;[[#crowley2008|Crowley]], 2008, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Some legal scholars and feminist writers have accused the fathers' rights movement of putting the interests of fathers above the interests of children, for example, by suggesting that it is acceptable for fathers to withdraw child support if they are not given access to their children, or by lobbying for changes in family law that would allegedly heighten children's exposure to abusive fathers, and would allegedly further endanger mothers who are victims of domestic violence.&lt;ref name=Rossi2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaye1998&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaye|first=Miranda|author2=Julia Tolmie|title=Discoursing Dads: The Rhetorical Devices of Fathers' Rights Groups|journal=Melbourne University Law Review|year=1998|volume=22|pages=172–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kelly|last=Behre|date=13 June 2014|title=The Fathers' Rights Movement Undermines Victims of Domestic Violence|url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/06/13/fathers-rights-and-womens-equality/the-fathers-rights-movement-undermines-victims-of-domestic-violence|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism is that father's rights activists allegedly incorrectly maintain that the courts are biased against fathers, while in reality the vast majority of cases are settled by private agreement and fathers voluntarily relinquish primary custody of their children, which explains the lower percentage of custodial fathers; and that the "bias" of courts is in favour of the primary caregiver, not mothers per se.&lt;ref name="Separation Divorce and Remarriage" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rossi2004"/&gt;

Researchers [[Martha Fineman]], [[Michael Flood]], and others have criticized the movement for allegedly perpetuating negative stereotypes of women as deceptive, vindictive, and irresponsible, as well as the stereotype that women are out to take advantage of men financially.&lt;ref name=Rossi2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaye1998/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanigsberg|first=Julia E.|title=Mother Troubles: Rethinking Contemporary Maternal Dilemmas|year=1999|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|isbn=0-8070-6787-3|page=150|author2=Sara Ruddick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable commentators==
Public supporters of the fathers' rights movement and their issues include [[Live Aid]] founder [[Bob Geldof]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Bob Geldof | publisher =Shared Parenting Information Group (SPIG) UK | url = http://www.spig.clara.net/geldof.htm | accessdate =2007-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Irish writer and journalist [[John Waters (columnist)|John Waters]] and [[Karen DeCrow]], former president of the [[National Organization for Women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Welcome to California Shared Parenting Alliance |publisher=California Shared Parenting Alliance | url =http://cspaonline.org/ | accessdate =2007-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Family law reform helps children"&gt;{{cite news | last = Fittro | first = T | last2 = Baskerville | first2 = S | title = Family law reform helps children | newspaper = Charleston Gazette-Mail | location = Carleston, West Virginia | url = http://www.wvgazette.com/section//2007022517 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070311224830/http://www.wvgazette.com/section//2007022517 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2007-03-11 | accessdate = 2007-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable commentators include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3939">The '''Global Forum for Health Research''' is an international foundation headquartered in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] established in 1997 to increase the amount of research into global health issues. It coined the phrase [[10/90 gap]] to identify the observation that only 10% of the world's health research spending is targeted at 90% of present health problems.&lt;ref name="capdevila" /&gt;

The Global Forum is a partner to the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref name="who"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/research_policy/en/|title=Research Policy|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=2009-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her keynote address to the Forum in 1999 [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]], then Director–General of WHO, declared that the Global Forum was key in the involvement of all the various levels, sectors and disciplines of "development agencies, the research community, health workers and end–users".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/1999/english/19990609_geneva_global_forum.html|title=Dr. G.H.

Global HealthShare® initiative (GHS) is a program launched in June 2010 by the [[University of California, Davis]] Center of Excellence for [[Nutritional genomics|Nutritional Genomics]]. The program plans to share resources to improve the health in [[developing countries]]. Alliances with other research institutions, humanitarian organizations and private companies around the world have been made to meet this goal.

The organization will use a multidisciplinary approach against [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] and [[Infectious disease|infectious]] disease, breaking down their efforts into two main research "cores": the Nutrition Core and Mucosal Immunity Core. The former focuses on fighting [[malnutrition]] and the latter on developing new ways to deliver [[vaccines]] more effectively to developing countries. The program differentiates itself from others like it by focusing on the delivery of the beneficial product to the end-user rather than the academic research process.

The program was announced by [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] in September 2010. At the time of the announcement, the program was valued at $US40 billion over a five-year period, funded by state and private donors,&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jEjj_XD4L21sQLY3DEogHXxLXQHAD9ICPTGG0|title=UN promotes health campaign for women, children|last=Snow|first=Anita|date=22 September 2010|work=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the UN hoping for more pledges to follow.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt; The objective of the program was to save the lives of 16 million people during the period of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-11392954|title=UN launches $40bn woman and child health plan|date=22 September 2010|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Millennium Development Goals]] 4, 5 and 6 were showing the slowest rate of progression, this program was also instituted to gain momentum in achieving them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://resourcecentre.savethechildren.net/node/8936/pdf/ewec_progress_report_final_3.pdf|title=Saving Lives Protecting Futures: Progress Report on the Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health 2010-2015|work=Resource Centre|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of the program was led by the [[World Health Organization]], reporting to the UN.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt;

The aid-based program was accompanied by pledges from some developing nations (including [[Tanzania]] and [[Rwanda]]) to increase their own domestic spending on health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2010/sep/22/millennium-development-goals-governments-pledge|title=Millennium development goals: governments pledge £25.5bn to eradicate world poverty|last=Boseley|first=Sarah|author2=Curtis, Polly|date=22 September 2010|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the UN, around $8.6 million of the program's funding came from what it described as "low-income countries".&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE68L1K820100922|title=U.N. chief to launch women, children health drive|last=Worsnip|first=Patrick|date=22 September 2010|work=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International aid group [[Oxfam]] expressed doubts about the program, including the extent to which its funding was genuinely new.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt;

== Progress: 2010-2015 ==
The Global Strategy managed to improve the coordination of global efforts towards the improvement of women’s and children’s health as well as enhancing strategies to tackle this. It gave rise to the “Every Woman Every Child” movement, which assisted in the mobilisation of stakeholders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite not reaching targets, reductions in both child and [[Maternal Mortality|maternal mortality]] were noted; of 49% and 45% respectively from 1990 to 2013.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Temmerman|first=Marleen|last2=Khosla|first2=Rajat|last3=Bhutta|first3=Zulfiqar A.|last4=Bustreo|first4=Flavia|date=2015-09-14|title=Towards a new Global Strategy for Women's, Children's and Adolescents' Health|url=https://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h4414|journal=BMJ|language=en|volume=351|pages=h4414|doi=10.1136/bmj.h4414|issn=1756-1833|pmid=26371228}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2.4 million maternal and child deaths were prevented.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, [[oral rehydration therapy]] and exclusive breastfeeding coverage showed the most significant improvement, however, progress in [[vaccination]] and [[pneumonia]] was still lagging.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[United Nations]] also reported increased collaboration with the private sector, with an increase in donor funding of US$19.8 billion noted from September 2010 to May 2014.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Health care prices in the United States''' describes market and non-market factors that determine pricing, along with possible causes as to why prices are higher than other countries. Compared to other OECD countries, U.S. healthcare costs are one-third higher or more relative to the size of the economy (GDP).&lt;ref name="OECD1"/&gt; According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], during 2015 health expenditures per-person were nearly $10,000 on average, with total expenditures of $3.2 trillion or 17.8% [[Gross domestic product|GDP]].&lt;ref name="CDC1"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/health-expenditures.htm CDC-National Center for Health Statistics-Retrieved October 26, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; Proximate reasons for the differences with other countries include: higher prices for the same services (i.e., higher price per unit) and greater use of healthcare (i.e., more units consumed). Higher administrative costs, higher per-capita income, and less government intervention to drive down prices are deeper causes.&lt;ref name="Atlantic1"/&gt; While the annual inflation rate in healthcare costs has declined in recent decades;&lt;ref name="FRED1"/&gt; it still remains above the rate of economic growth, resulting in a steady increase in healthcare expenditures relative to GDP from 6% in 1970 to nearly 18% in 2015.&lt;ref name="CDC1"/&gt;

==Nature of the healthcare markets==

=== Coverage===
{{See|Health insurance coverage in the United States}}

Health insurance coverage is provided by several public and private sources in the United States. During 2016, the U.S. population overall was approximately 325 million, with 53 million persons 65 years of age and over covered by the federal [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] program. The 272 million non-institutional persons under age 65 either obtained their coverage from employer-based (155 million) or non-employer based (90 million) sources, or were uninsured (27 million).&lt;ref name="CBO_Subsidy2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/51385|title=Federal Subsidies for Health Insurance Coverage for People Under Age 65|publisher=CBO|date=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 15 million military personnel received coverage through the Veteran's Administration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2016/demo/p60-257.html Census Bureau-Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2015 - Published September, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; During the year 2016, 91.2% of Americans had health insurance coverage. An estimated 27 million under age 65 were uninsured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2017/demo/p60-260.html|title=Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2016|last=Bureau|first=US Census|website=www.census.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Price transparency issues ===
[[File:US healthcare cost panel v1.png|thumb|350px|right|U.S. healthcare cost information, including rate of change, per-capita, and percent of GDP.]]

Unlike most markets for consumer services in the [[United States]], the [[Healthcare industry|health care]] market generally lacks [[Transparency (market)|transparent]] [[market-based]] [[Price discovery|pricing]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20130731"&gt;{{cite news |last=Rosenberg |first=Tina |title=Revealing a Health Care Secret: The Price |url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/31/a-new-health-care-approach-dont-hide-the-price/ |date=July 31, 2013 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=August 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20130601"&gt;{{cite news |last=Rosenthal |first=Elisabeth |title=

According to the [[New York Times]] in 2011, "the United States is far and away the world leader in medical spending, even though numerous studies have concluded that Americans do not get better [[health care|care]]"&lt;ref name="NYT-20130601" /&gt; and prices are the highest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laugesen|first1=Miriam J.|authorlink2=Sherry Glied|last2=Glied|first2=Sherry A.|title=Higher Fees Paid To US Physicians Drive Higher Spending For Physician Services Compared To Other Countries|journal=Health Affairs|date=September 2011|volume=30|issue=9|pages=1647–1656|url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/30/9/1647.abstract|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2010.0204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S. [[medical industry]], patients generally do not have access to pricing information until after medical services have been rendered. A study conducted by the [[California Healthcare Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chcf.org California Healthcare Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; found that only 25% of visitors asking for pricing information were able to  obtain it in a single visit to a hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.chcf.org/topics/hospitals/index.cfm?itemID=117606 |title=Price Check: The Mystery of Hospital Pricing - CHCF.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2006-02-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514055320/http://www.chcf.org/topics/hospitals/index.cfm?itemID=117606 |archive-date=2006-05-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the majority (85%) of Americans have [[health insurance]], they do not directly pay for medical services.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/income_wealth/002484.html |title=U.S. Census Press Releases |access-date=2017-12-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627041510/http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/income_wealth/002484.html |archive-date=2006-06-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Insurance companies, as payors, negotiate health care pricing with providers on behalf of the insured. Hospitals, doctors, and other medical providers have traditionally disclosed their fee schedules only to insurance companies and other institutional payors, and not to individual patients. Uninsured individuals are expected to pay directly for services, but since they lack access to pricing information, price-based competition may be reduced. The introduction of high-deductible insurance has increased demand for pricing information among consumers.  As high-deductible [[health plan]]s rise across the country, with many individuals having deductibles of $2500 or more, their ability to pay for costly procedures diminishes, and hospitals end up covering the cost of patients care.  Many health systems are putting in place price transparency initiatives and payments plans for their patients so that the patients better understand what the estimated cost of their care is, and how they can afford to pay for their care over time.

Organizations such as the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) and [[AARP]] support a "fair and accurate valuation for all physician services".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/solutions-managing-your-practice/coding-billing-insurance/medicare/the-resource-based-relative-value-scale.page |title=RBRVS: Resource-Based Relative Value Scale |publisher=American Medical Association |accessdate=May 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-static-w2-md.aarp.org/about_aarp/new_paradigm.html |title=AARP: Creating a New Health Care Paradigm |publisher=AARP |accessdate=May 3, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Very few resources exist, however, that allow consumers to compare physician prices (one exception is CostOfDoctors.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://costofdoctors.com |title=CostOfDoctors.com: a way to compare physician prices |publisher=Avalon Business Systems |accessdate=December 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The AMA sponsors the [[Specialty Society Relative Value Scale Update Committee]], a private group of physicians which largely determine how to value physician labor in Medicare prices. Among politicians, former House Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]] has called for transparency in the prices of medical devices, noting it is one of the few aspects or U.S. health care where consumers and federal health officials are "barred from comparing the quality, medical outcomes or price".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=With Health Care, Taxpayers Deserve To Know What They're Paying For |author1=Newt Gingrich |author2=Wayne Oliver |url=https://www.forbes.com/2011/04/19/newt-gingrich-healthcare.html |work=Forbes.com |date=April 19, 2011 |accessdate=May 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gingrich calls for medical device price transparency |author=Brendon Nafziger |url=http://www.dotmed.com/news/story/15972/ |work=DotMed |date=May 2, 2011 |accessdate=May 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Newt Gingrich Backs Price Transparency for Medical Devices |author=Leigh Page |url=http://www.beckersasc.com/asc-supply-chain-materials-management/newt-gingrich-backing-price-transparency-for-medical-devices.html |work=Becker's ASC Review |date=May 3, 2011 |accessdate=May 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, some insurance companies have announced their intention to begin disclosing provider pricing as a way to encourage cost reduction.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Other services exist to assist physicians and their patients, such as [[Healthcare Out Of Pocket]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://gethoop.com/ Compare Provider Chargers]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Accuro Healthcare Solutions]], with its CarePricer software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imacs.com/products/carepricer.php Patient Estimates - Accuro Healthcare Solutions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, medical tourists take advantage of price transparency on websites such as [[MEDIGO]] and [http://purchasinghealth.com Purchasing Health], which offer hospital price comparison and appointment booking services.&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/02/medigo-picks-up-6-2m-led-by-accel-to-take-its-medical-tourism-marketplace-to-the-us-and-uk/ Patient Estimates - MEDIGO&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Government-mandated critical care ===
In the United States and most other industrialized nations, emergency medical providers are required to treat any patient that has a life-threatening condition, irrespective of the patient's financial resources. In the U.S., the [[Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act]] requires that hospitals treat all patients in need of emergency medical care without considering patients' ability to pay for service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aaem.org/emtala/index.shtml |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-02-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211035532/http://www.aaem.org/emtala/index.shtml |archive-date=2006-02-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This government mandated care places a cost burden on medical providers, as critically ill patients lacking financial resources must be treated. Medical providers compensate for this cost by passing costs on to other parts of the medical system by increasing prices for other patients and through collection of government subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aspe.hhs.gov/health/reports/02/DSH/execsum.htm#Introduction Analysis of the Joint Distribution of Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments: Executive Summary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Healthcare is not a typical market===
Harvard economist [[N. Gregory Mankiw]] explained in July 2017 that "the magic of the free market sometimes fails us when it comes to healthcare." This is due to:
*Important positive [[externalities]] or situations where the actions of one person or company positively impact the health of others, such as vaccinations and medical research. The free market will result in too little of both (i.e., the benefit is under-estimated by individuals), so government intervention such as subsidies is required to optimize the market outcome.
*Consumers don't know what to buy, as the technical nature of the product requires expert physician advice. The inability to monitor product quality leads to regulation (e.g., licensing of medical professionals and the safety of pharmaceutical products).
*Healthcare spending is unpredictable and expensive. This results in insurance to pool risks and reduce uncertainty. However, this creates a side-effect, the decreased visibility of spending and a tendency to over-consume medical care.
*Adverse selection, where insurers can choose to avoid sick patients. This can lead to a "death spiral" in which the healthiest people drop out of insurance coverage perceiving it too expensive, leading to higher prices for the remainder, repeating the cycle.&lt;ref name="Mankiw1"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/28/upshot/why-health-care-policy-is-so-hard.html?_r=0 NYT-N. Gregory Mankiw-Why Health Care Policy is So Hard-July 28, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; The conservative [[Heritage Foundation]] advocated individual mandates in the late 1980's to overcome adverse selection by requiring all persons to obtain insurance or pay penalties, an idea included in the [[Affordable Care Act]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2017/07/30/heritage-on-health-1989/ NYT-Paul Krugman-Heritage on Health, 1989-July 30, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medicare and Medicaid ==
[[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] was established in 1965 under President [[Lyndon Johnson]], as a form of [[medical insurance]] for the elderly (age 65 and above) and the disabled. [[Medicaid]] was established at the same time to provide medical insurance primarily to children, pregnant women, and certain other medically needy groups.

The [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) reported in October 2017 that adjusted for timing differences, Medicare spending rose by $22 billion (4%) in fiscal year 2017, reflecting growth in both the number of beneficiaries and in the average benefit payment. Medicaid spending rose by $7 billion (2%) in part because of more persons enrolled due to the [[Affordable Care Act]]. Unadjusted for timing shifts, in 2017 Medicare spending was $595 billion and Medicaid spending was $375 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53181 CBO-Monthly Budget Review for September 2017-October 6, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; Medicare covered 57 million people as of September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/CMSProgramStatistics/Dashboard.html CMS.gov Medicare enrollment dashboard-Retrieved October 27, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; While on the other hand, Medicaid covered 68.4 million people as of July 2017, 74.3 million including the [[Children's Health Insurance Program]] (CHIP).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/program-information/medicaid-and-chip-enrollment-data/report-highlights/index.html Medicaid.gov July 2017 Medicaid and CHIP Enrollment Data Highlights-Retrieved October 27, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

Medicare and Medicaid are managed at the Federal level by the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS). CMS sets fee schedules for medical services through Prospective Payment Systems (PPS) for inpatient care, outpatient care, and other services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/home/medicare.asp Medicare&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; As the largest single purchaser of medical services in the U.S., Medicare's fixed pricing schedules have a significant impact on the market. These prices are set based on CMS' analysis of labor and resource input costs for different medical services based on recommendations by the American Medical Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Laugesen|first1=Miriam J.|title=Fixing Medical Prices: How Physicians are Paid|date=2016|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780674545168|page=288|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674545168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of Medicare's pricing system, [[relative value units]] (RVUs) are assigned to every medical procedure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/2292.html AMA (RBRVS) RBRVS: Resource-Based Relative Value Scale&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; One RVU translates into a dollar value that varies by region and by year; in 2005 the base (not location adjusted) RVU equaled roughly $37.90. Major insurers use Medicare's RVU calculations when negotiating payment schedules with providers, and many insurers simply adopt Medicare's payment schedule. The AMA-sponsored committee in charge of determining RVUs of medical procedures that inform Medicare's payment to physicians has been shown to grossly inflate their figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How a secretive panel uses data that distort doctors’ pay |author1=Peter Whoriskey |author2=Dan Keating |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/how-a-secretive-panel-uses-data-that-distorts-doctors-pay/2013/07/20/ee134e3a-eda8-11e2-9008-61e94a7ea20d_story.html |work=The Washington Post |date=July 20, 2013 |accessdate=March 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Employer-based market==
[[File:US_Health_Insurance_Premiums_for_Families_-_1999_to_2014.png|thumb|right|350px|The rate of increase in both health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket costs have declined in the employer-based market. For example, premiums increased at an annual rate of 5.6% from 2000-2010, but 3.1% from 2010-2016.]]
An estimated 155 million persons under the age 65 were covered under health insurance plans provided by their employers in 2016. The [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) estimated that the health insurance premium for single coverage would be $6,400 and family coverage would be $15,500 in 2016. The annual rate of increase in premiums has generally slowed after 2000, as part of the trend of lower annual healthcare cost increases.&lt;ref name="CBO_Employer1"&gt;[https://www.cbo.gov/publication/51130 CBO-Private Health Insurance Premiums and Federal Policy-February 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;
The Federal Government subsidizes the employer-based market by an estimated $250 billion per year (about $1,612 per person covered in the employer market), by excluding health insurance premiums from employee income. This subsidy encourages people to buy more extensive coverage (which places upward pressure on average premiums), while also encouraging more young, healthy people to enroll (which places downward pressure on premium prices). CBO estimates the net effect is to increase premiums 10-15% over an un-subsidized level.&lt;ref name="CBO_Employer1"/&gt;

The [[Kaiser Family Foundation]] estimated that family insurance premiums averaged $18,142 in 2016, up 3% from 2015, with workers paying $5,277 towards that cost and employers covering the remainder. Single coverage premiums were essentially unchanged from 2015 to 2016 at $6,435, with workers contributing $1,129 and employers covering the remainder.&lt;ref name="Kaiser_Employer16"&gt;[http://www.kff.org/health-costs/report/2016-employer-health-benefits-survey/ Kaiser-2016 Employer Health Benefits Survey-September 14, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

The President's [[Council of Economic Advisors]] (CEA) described how annual cost increases have fallen in the employer market since 2000. Premiums for family coverage grew 5.6% from 2000-2010, but 3.1% from 2010-2016. The total premium plus estimated out-of-pocket costs (i.e., deductibles and co-payments) increased 5.1% from 2000-2010 but 2.4% from 2010-2016.&lt;ref name="CEA_2017"&gt;[https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/administration/eop/cea/economic-report-of-the-President/2017 CEA-Economic Report of the President 2017-Chapter 8-Figure 4-34]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces==
{{Main|Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act}}
Separate from the employer market are the ACA marketplaces, which covered an estimated 12 million persons in 2017 who individually obtain insurance (e.g., not as part of a business). The law is designed to pay [[Subsidy|subsidies]] in the form of premium tax credits to the individuals or families purchasing the insurance, based on income levels. Higher income consumers receive lower subsidies. While pre-subsidy prices rose considerably from 2016 to 2017, so did the subsidies, to reduce the after-subsidy cost to the consumer. 

For example, a study published in 2016 found that the average requested 2017 premium increase among 40-year-old non-smokers was about 9 percent, according to an analysis of 17 cities, although Blue Cross Blue Shield proposed increases of 40 percent in Alabama and 60 percent in Texas.&lt;ref name="Mali"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/291056-next-president-faces-possible-obamacare-meltdown |title=Next president faces possible ObamaCare meltdown |last=Mali |first=Meghashyam |date=August 11, 2016 |accessdate=August 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some or all of these costs are offset by subsidies, paid as tax credits. For example, the [[Kaiser Foundation]] reported that for the second-lowest cost "Silver plan" (a plan often selected and used as the benchmark for determining financial assistance), a 40-year old non-smoker making $30,000 per year would pay effectively the same amount in 2017 as they did in 2016 (about $208/month) after the subsidy/tax credit, despite large increases in the pre-subsidy price. This was consistent nationally. In other words, the subsidies increased along with the pre-subsidy price, fully offsetting the price increases.&lt;ref name=Kaiser_Premiums&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/2017-premium-changes-and-insurer-participation-in-the-affordable-care-acts-health-insurance-marketplaces/ |title=2017 Premium Changes and Insurer Participation in the Affordable Care Act's Health Insurance Marketplaces |website=Kaiser Family Foundation |accessdate=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This premium tax credit subsidy is separate from the [[cost sharing reductions subsidy]] discontinued in 2017 by President Donald Trump, an action which raised premiums in the ACA marketplaces by an estimated 20 percentage points above what otherwise would have occurred, for the 2018 plan year.&lt;ref name="CBO-CSR1"&gt;[https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53009 "CBO: The Effects of Terminating Payments for Cost-Sharing Reductions"-August 15, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deductibles==
While health insurance premium cost increases have moderated in the employer market, some of this is because of insurance policies that have a higher [[deductible]], [[Copayment|co-payments]] and out-of-pocket maximums that shift costs from insurers to patients. In addition, many employees are choosing to combine a [[health savings account]] with higher deductible plans, making the impact of the ACA difficult to determine precisely.

For those who obtain their insurance through their employer ("group market"), a 2016 survey found that:
* Deductibles grew by 63% from 2011 to 2016, while premiums increased 19% and worker earnings grew by 11%.
* In 2016, 4 in 5 workers had an insurance deductible, which averaged $1,478. For firms with less than 200 employees, the deductible averaged $2,069.
* The percentage of workers with a deductible of at least $1,000 grew from 10% in 2006 to 51% in 2016. The 2016 figure drops to 38% after taking employer contributions into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/09/14/the-quiet-change-to-insurance-plans-thats-making-health-care-more-expensive-for-patients/ |title=How companies are quietly changing your health plan to make you pay more |last=Johnson |first=Carolyn Y. |date=September 14, 2016 |website=Washington Post |publisher= |accessdate=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the "non-group" market, of which two-thirds are covered by the ACA exchanges, a survey of 2015 data found that:
* 49% had individual deductibles of at least $1,500 ($3,000 for family), up from 36% in 2014.
* Many marketplace enrollees qualify for cost-sharing subsidies that reduce their net deductible.
* While about 75% of enrollees were "very satisfied" or "somewhat satisfied" with their choice of doctors and hospitals, only 50% had such satisfaction with their annual deductible.
* While 52% of those covered by the ACA exchanges felt "well protected" by their insurance, in the group market 63% felt that way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://kff.org/health-reform/poll-finding/survey-of-non-group-health-insurance-enrollees-wave-3/ |title=Survey of Non-Group Health Insurance Enrollees, Wave 3 |date=May 20, 2016 |website=kff.org |publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation |accessdate=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prescription drugs ==
{{main|Prescription drug prices in the United States}}

According to the OECD, U.S. prescription drug spending in 2015 was $1,162 per person on average, versus $807 for Canada, $766 for Germany, $668 for France, and $497 for the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[https://data.oecd.org/healthres/pharmaceutical-spending.htm#indicator-chart OECD Data-Pharmaceutical spending-Retrieved May 15, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for higher costs==
The reasons for higher U.S. healthcare costs relative to other countries and over time are debated by experts. 

===Relative to other countries===
[[File:Healthcare costs to GDP OECD 2015 v1.png|thumb|right|450px|Bar chart comparing healthcare costs as percentage of GDP across OECD countries]]
[[File:OECD life expectacy and health spending per capita 2013 v1.png|thumb|right|450px|Chart showing life expectancy at birth and health care spending per capita for OECD countries as of 2013.  The U.S. is an outlier, with much higher spending but below average life expectancy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/health/health-systems/health-at-a-glance-19991312.htm OECD Health at a Glance 2015-Table 3.3]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
U.S. healthcare costs in 2015 were 16.9% GDP according to the OECD, over 5% GDP higher than the next most expensive OECD country.&lt;ref name="OECD1"&gt;[http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=SHA OECD Statistical Database-Health expenditure and financing-Retrieved October 25, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; With U.S. GDP of $19 trillion, healthcare costs were about $3.2 trillion, or about $10,000 per person in a country of 320 million people. A gap of 5% GDP represents $1 trillion, about $3,000 per person relative to the next most expensive country. In other words, the U.S. would have to cut healthcare costs by roughly one-third ($1 trillion or $3,000 per person on average) to be competitive with the next most expensive country. Healthcare spending in the U.S. was distributed as follows in 2014: Hospital care 32%; physician and clinical services 20%; prescription drugs 10%; and all other, including many categories individually making up less than 5% of spending. These first three categories accounted for 62% of spending.&lt;ref name="CDC1"/&gt;

Important differences include:
*''Administrative costs''. About 25% of U.S. healthcare costs relate to administrative costs (e.g., billing and payment, as opposed to direct provision of services, supplies and medicine) versus 10-15% in other countries. For example, Duke University Hospital had 900 hospital beds but 1,300 billing clerks.&lt;ref name="Cutler1"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/why-does-health-care-cost-so-much-in-america-ask-harvards-david-cutler PBS-Why Does Healthcare Cost So Much in America? Ask Harvard's David Cutler-November 19, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnhp.org/beyondaca Physicians for a National Health Program-Beyond the ACA: A Physicians Proposal for Single Payer Healthcare-Retrieved October 25, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming $3.2 trillion is spent on healthcare per year, a 10% savings would be $320 billion per year and a 15% savings would be nearly $500 billion per year. For scale, cutting administrative costs to peer country levels would represent roughly one-third to half the gap. A 2009 study from Price Waterhouse Coopers estimated $210 billion in savings from unnecessary billing and administrative costs, a figure that would be considerably higher in 2015 dollars.&lt;ref name="Dalen1"&gt;[http://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(09)01115-2/fulltext Dr. James E. Dalen-The American Journal of Medicine-March 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Cost variation across hospital regions''. Harvard economist [[David Cutler]] reported in 2013 that roughly 33% of healthcare spending, or about $1 trillion per year, is not associated with improved outcomes.&lt;ref name="Cutler1"/&gt; Medicare reimbursements per enrollee vary significantly across the country. In 2012, average Medicare reimbursements per enrollee ranged from an adjusted (for health status, income, and ethnicity) $6,724 in the lowest spending region to $13,596 in the highest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hamiltonproject.org/papers/economic_facts_about_health_care_insurance_markets_after_aca Hamilton Project-Six Economic Facts About Health Care and Health Insurance Markets after the Affordable Care Act-October 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''The U.S. spends more than other countries for the same things''. Drugs are more expensive, doctors are paid more, and suppliers charge more for medical equipment than other countries.&lt;ref name="Cutler1"/&gt; Journalist Todd Hixon reported on a study that U.S. spending on physicians per person is about five times higher than peer countries, $1,600 versus $310, as much as 37% of the gap with other countries. This was driven by a greater use of specialist doctors, who charge 3-6 times more in the U.S. than in peer countries.&lt;ref name="Hixon1"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/toddhixon/2012/03/01/why-are-u-s-health-care-costs-so-high/#54d1076d1dae Forbes-Todd Hixon-Why are U.S. healthcare costs so high?-March 1, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Higher level of per-capita income'', which is correlated with higher healthcare spending in the U.S. and other countries. Hixon reported a study by Princeton Professor [[Uwe Reinhardt]] that concluded about $1,200 per person (in 2008 dollars) or about a third of the gap with peer countries in healthcare spending was due to higher levels of per-capita income. Higher income per-capita is correlated with using more units of healthcare.&lt;ref name="Hixon1"/&gt; 
*''Americans receive more medical care'' than people in other countries.  The U.S. consumes 3 times as many mammograms, 2.5x the number of MRI scans, and 31% more C-sections per-capita than peer countries. This is a blend of higher per-capita income and higher use of specialists, among other factors.&lt;ref name="Atlantic1"&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/07/why-do-other-rich-nations-spend-so-much-less-on-healthcare/374576/ The Atlantic-Victor Fuchs-Why Do Other Rich Nations Spend So Much Less on Healthcare?"-July 23, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''The U.S. government intervenes less actively to force down prices'' in the United States than in other countries. Stanford economist Victor Fuchs wrote in 2014: "If we turn the question around and ask why healthcare costs so much less in other high-income countries, the answer nearly always points to a larger, stronger role for government. Governments usually eliminate much of the high administrative costs of insurance, obtain lower prices for inputs, and influence the mix of healthcare outputs by arranging for large supplies of primary-care physicians and hospital beds while keeping tight control on the number of specialist physicians and expensive technology. In the United States, the political system creates many “choke points” for diverse interest groups to block or modify government’s role in these areas."&lt;ref name="Atlantic1"/&gt;

===Relative to prior years===
The [[Congressional Budget Office]] analyzed the reasons for healthcare cost inflation over time, reporting in 2008 that: "Although many factors contributed to the growth, most analysts have concluded that the bulk of the long-term rise resulted from the health care system's use of new medical services that were made possible by technological advances..." In summarizing several studies, CBO reported the following drove the indicated share (shown as a range across three studies) of the increase from 1940 to 1990:
*Technology changes: 38-65%. CBO defined this as "any changes in clinical practice that enhance the ability of providers to diagnose, treat, or prevent health problems."
*Personal income growth: 5-23%. Persons with more income tend to spend a greater share of it on healthcare.
*Administrative costs: 3-13%. 
*Aging of the population: 2%. As the country ages, more persons require more expensive treatments, as the aged tend to be sicker.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbo.gov/publication/41665 CBO-Technological Change and the Growth of Healthcare Spending-January 31, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Federal Reserve data, healthcare annual inflation rates have declined in recent decades:
*1970-1979: 7.8%
*1980-1989: 8.3%
*1990-1999: 5.3%
*2000-2009: 4.1%
*2010-2016: 3.0%&lt;ref name="FRED1"&gt;[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIMEDSL#0 Federal Reserve Data FRED-CPI All Urban Consumer:Medical Care-Retrieved October 26, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

While this inflation rate has declined, it has generally remained above the rate of economic growth, resulting in a steady increase of health expenditures relative to GDP from 6% in 1970 to nearly 18% in 2015.&lt;ref name="CDC1"/&gt;

Since health literacy is a primary contributing factor to [[health disparities]], it is a continued and increasing concern for health professionals. The 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) conducted by the US Department of Education found that 36% of participants scored as either "basic" or "below basic" in terms of their health literacy and concluded that approximately 80 million Americans have limited health literacy.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Health Literacy of America's Adults: Results From the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy|last=Kutner|first=MA|last2=Greenberg|first2=E|last3=Jin|first3=Y|last4=Paulson|first4=C|publisher=National Center for Education Statistics|year=2006|isbn=|location=Washington, DC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These individuals have difficulty with common health tasks including reading the label of a prescribed drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=America's Health Literacy: Why We Need Accessible Health Information|url=http://health.gov/communication/literacy/issuebrief/|website=health.gov|accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several factors may influence health literacy. However, the following factors have been shown to strongly increase this risk: age (especially patients 65 years and older), limited English language proficiency or English as a second language, less education, and lower socioeconomic status. Patients with low health literacy understand less about their medical conditions and treatments and overall report worse health status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1999-02-10|title=Health literacy: report of the Council on Scientific Affairs.

Various interventions, such as simplifying information and illustrations, avoiding [[jargon]], using "[[The teach-back method|teach-back]]" methods, and encouraging patients' questions, have improved health behaviors in persons with low health literacy. The proportion of adults aged 18 and over in the U.S., in the year 2010, who reported that their health care providers always explained things so they could understand them was about 60.6%.&lt;ref name="healthypeople.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/health-communication-and-health-information-technology/national-snapshot|title=Health Communication and Health Information Technology - Healthy People 2020|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This number increased 1% from 2007 to 2010.&lt;ref name="healthypeople.gov" /&gt; The [[Healthy People program#Healthy People 2010 and Healthy People 2020|Healthy People 2020]] initiative of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] has included health literacy as a pressing new topic, with objectives for improving it in the decade to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topicsobjectives2020/overview.aspx?topicid=18|title=Health Communication and Health Information Technology - Healthy People 2020|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Society as a whole is responsible for improving health literacy. Most importantly, improving health literacy is the responsibility of healthcare and public health professionals and systems.

==Characteristics==

=== Plain language ===
In order to have a patient that understands health terms and can make proper health decisions, the language used by health professionals has to be at a level that others who are not in the medical field can understand. Health professionals must know their audience in order to better serve their patients. The language used by these professionals should be [[plain language]]. Plain language is a strategy for making written and oral information easier to understand; it is communication that users can understand the first time they read or hear it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Health Literacy - Fact Sheet: Health Literacy Basics|url = http://health.gov/communication/literacy/quickguide/factsbasic.htm|website = health.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some key elements of plain language include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plainlanguage.gov/howto/guidelines/FederalPLGuidelines/TOC.cfm|title=Federal Plain Language Guidelines: Table of Contents|website=www.plainlanguage.gov|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Organizing information so most important points come first
* Breaking complex information into understandable chunks
* Using simple language and defining technical terms
* Using active voice
* Using lists and tables to make complex material easier to understand

The National Institute of Health (NIH) recommends that patient education materials should be not written higher than a 6th-7th grade reading level; further recommendations provided by the NIH Office of Communications and Public Liaison are published in their [https://www.nih.gov/institutes-nih/nih-office-director/office-communications-public-liaison/clear-communication "Clear Communication" Initiative.]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nih.gov/institutes-nih/nih-office-director/office-communications-public-liaison/clear-communication|title=Clear Communication|work=National Institutes of Health (NIH)|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Factors ===
Many factors determine the health literacy level of [[health education]] materials or interventions: [[Reading level|readability]] of the text, the patient's current state of health, [[language barrier]]s of the patient, cultural appropriateness of the materials, format and style, sentence structure, use of illustrations, and numerous other factors.

A study of 2,600 patients conducted in 1995 by two US hospitals found that between 26% and 60% of patients could not understand medication directions, a standard [[informed consent]] form, or materials about scheduling an appointment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=M. V. Williams|year=1995|title=Inadequate functional health literacy among patients at two public hospitals|journal=JAMA|volume=274|issue=21|pages=677–82|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/274/21/1677|accessdate=2006-06-30|doi=10.1001/jama.274.21.1677|pmid=7474271|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) conducted by the US Department of Education found that 36% of participants scored as either "basic" or "below basic" in terms of their health literacy and  concluded that approximately 80 million Americans have limited health literacy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==History==
The young and multidisciplinary field of '''health literacy''' emerged from two groups of experts: physicians, health providers such as nurses,&lt;ref&gt;Dickens, C., and Piano, MR. (2013) "Health literacy and nursing: an update." The American Journal of Nursing.  Jun;113(6):52-7. doi: 10.1097/01.NAJ.0000431271.83277.2f.&lt;/ref&gt; and health educators; and [[Adult Basic Education]] (ABE) and [[English as a second language]] (ESL) practitioners in the field of education. [[Physicians]] and [[nurses]] are a source of patient comprehension and compliance studies. Adult Basic Education / English for Speakers of Languages Other Than English (ABE/ESOL) specialists study and design interventions to help people develop reading, writing, and conversation skills and increasingly infuse curricula with health information to promote better health literacy. A range of approaches to adult education brings health literacy skills to people in traditional classroom settings, as well as where they work and live.

===Biomedical approach===
The [[biomedical approach]] to health literacy that became dominant (in the U.S.) during the 1980s and 1990s often depicted individuals as lacking health literacy or "suffering" from low health literacy. This approach assumed that recipients are passive in their possession and reception of health literacy and believed that models of literacy and health literacy are politically neutral and universally applicable. This approach is found lacking when placed in the context of broader ecological, critical, and cultural approaches to health. This approach has produced, and continues to reproduce, numerous correlational studies.&lt;ref&gt;Pleasant &amp; Kuruvilla, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Level of health literacy is considered adequate when the population has sufficient knowledge, skills, and confidence to guide their own health, and people are able to stay healthy, recover from illness, and/or live with disability or disease.&lt;ref name="McMurray"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anne McMurray|title=Community Health and Wellness: A Sociological Approach|location=Brisbane|publisher=Elsevier|year=2007|ISBN=978-0-7295-3788-9|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McMurray states that health literacy is important in a community because it addresses health inequities. It is no coincidence that individuals with lower levels of health literacy live, disproportionally, in communities with lower socio-economic standing. A barrier to achieving adequate health literacy for these individuals is a lack of awareness, or understanding of, information and resources relevant to improving their health. This knowledge gap arises from both patients being unable to understand information presented to them and hospitals' inadequate efforts and materials to address these literacy gaps.

A more robust view of health literacy includes the ability to [[Scientific literacy|understand scientific concepts]], content, and health research; skills in spoken, written, and online communication; critical interpretation of mass media messages; navigating complex systems of health care and governance; knowledge and use of community capital and resources; and using cultural and indigenous knowledge in health decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nutbeam|first=D.|date=2000-09-01|title=Health literacy as a public health goal: a challenge for contemporary health education and communication strategies into the 21st century|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/heapro/15.3.259|journal=Health Promotion International|language=en|volume=15|issue=3|pages=259–267|doi=10.1093/heapro/15.3.259|issn=1460-2245}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ratzan|first=S.

This perspective defines health literacy as the wide range of skills, and competencies that people develop over their lifetimes to seek out, comprehend, evaluate, and use health information and concepts to make informed choices, reduce health risks, and increase quality of life.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zarcadoolas|first=Christina|last2=Pleasant|first2=Andrew|last3=Greer|first3=David S.|date=June 2005|title=Understanding health literacy: an expanded model|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15788526|journal=Health Promotion International|volume=20|issue=2|pages=195–203|doi=10.1093/heapro/dah609|issn=0957-4824|pmid=15788526}}&lt;/ref&gt; While various definitions vary in wording, they all fall within this conceptual framework.

Defining health literacy in that manner builds the foundation for a multi-dimensional model of health literacy built around four central domains:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

*fundamental literacy,
*scientific literacy,
*civic literacy, and
*cultural literacy.

There are several tests, which have verified reliability in the academic literature that can be administered in order to test one's health literacy. Some of these tests include the Medical Term Recognition Test (METER), which was developed in the United States (2 minute administration time) for the clinical setting.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Altin|first1=Sibel|last2=Finke|first2=Isabelle|last3=Kautz-Freimuth|first3=Sibylle|last4=Stock|first4=Stephanie|title=The evolution of health literacy assessment tools: a systematic review|journal=BMC Public Health|date=2014|volume=14|issue=1|page=1207|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-14-1207|pmc=4289240|pmid=25418011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The METER includes many words from the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) test.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The Short Assessment of Health Literacy in Spanish and English populations (SAHL-S&amp;E) uses word recognition and multiple choice questions to test a person's comprehension.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The CHC-Test measures Critical Health Competencies and consists of 72 items designed to test a person's understanding of medical concepts, literature searching, basic statistics, and design of experiments and samples.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==Patient safety and outcomes==
According to an [[Institute of Medicine]] (2004) report, low health literacy negatively affects the treatment outcome and safety of care delivery.&lt;ref&gt;The Institute of Medicine: [http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10883.html#toc Health Literacy: A Prescription to End Confusion] (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of health literacy affects all segments of the population.

The mismatch between a clinician's [[communication]] of content and a patient's ability to understand that content can lead to medication errors and adverse medical outcomes. Health literacy skills are not only a problem in the general population. Health care professionals (doctors, nurses, public health workers) can also have poor health literacy skills, such as a reduced ability to clearly explain health issues to patients and the public.&lt;ref&gt;American Society of Anesthesiology abstracts (October 25, 2005), Aaron M.

In addition to tailoring the content of what health professionals communicate to their patients, a well arranged layout, pertinent illustrations, and intuitive format of written materials can improve the usability of health care literature. This in turn can help in effective communication between healthcare providers and their patients.&lt;ref name="IJGM_Gill2012"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2012|title=Readability Assessment of Concussion and Traumatic Brain Injury Publications by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|journal=[[International Journal of General Medicine]]|volume=5|pages=923–933|doi=10.2147/IJGM.S37110|first1=P.S.|last1=Gill|first2=T.S.|last2=Gill|first3=A.|last3=Kamath|first4=B.|last4=whisnant|url=http://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=14417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk identification===
Identifying a patient as having low health literacy is essential for a healthcare professional to conform their health intervention in a way that the patient will understand. When patients with low health literacy receive care that is tailored to their more limited medical knowledge base, results have shown that health behaviors drastically improve. This has been seen with: correct medication use and dosage, utilizing health screenings, as well as increased exercise and smoking cessation. Effective visual aids have shown to help supplement the information communicated by the doctor in the office. In particular, easily readable brochures and videos have shown to be very effective.&lt;ref&gt;Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality: Evidence Report/Technology Assessment: Number 87 [http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/epcsums/litsum.htm Literacy and Health Outcomes]&lt;/ref&gt; Healthcare professionals can use many methods to attain patients' health literacy. A multitude of tests used during research studies and three minute assessments commonly used in doctors offices are examples of the variety of tests healthcare professionals can use to better understand their patients' health literacy.&lt;ref name="TOFLA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Conversation/&gt;&lt;ref name=NPSF/&gt;

The American Medical Association showed that asking simple single item questions, such as "How confident are you in filling out medical forms by yourself?", is a very effective and direct way to understand from a patient's point of view how they feel about interacting with their healthcare provider and understanding their health condition.&lt;ref name=Questions/&gt;

===Intervention===
In order to be understood by patients with insufficient health literacy, health professionals must intervene to provide clear and concise information that can be more easily understood. Avoidance of medical jargon, illustrations of important concepts, and confirming information by a "teach back" method have shown to be effective tools to communicating essential health topics with health illiterate patients.&lt;ref name=Conversation&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality|url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/perspectives/conversation-cultural-competence-cindy-brach-senior-health-policy-researcher-ahrq|title=A Conversation on Cultural Competence With Cindy Brach, Senior Health Policy Researcher, AHRQ|date=2013-04-17|accessdate=2013-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A program called "Ask Me 3"&lt;ref name=NPSF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askme3.org/index.asp|title=National Patient Safety Foundation|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308091008/http://www.askme3.org/index.asp|archivedate=2008-03-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is designed to bring public and physician attention to this issue, by letting patients know that they should ask three questions each time they talk to a doctor, nurse, or pharmacist:
*What is my main problem?
*What do I need to do?
*Why is it important for me to do this?

There have also been large-scale efforts to improve health literacy. For example, a public information program by the US Department of Health and Human Services encourages patients to improve healthcare quality and avoid errors by asking questions about health conditions and treatment.&lt;ref name=Questions&gt;Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality: [http://www.ahrq.gov/questionsaretheanswer/ Questions Are the Answer], retrieved 2008-10-18&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the IROHLA (Intervention Research on Health Literacy of the Ageing population)  project, funded by the European Union (EU), seeks to develop evidence-based guidelines for policy and practice to improve health literacy of the ageing population in EU member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irohla.eu/home/|title=Home|publisher=|access-date=2015-06-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613081655/http://www.irohla.eu/home/|archive-date=2015-06-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project has developed a framework and identified and validated interventions which together constitute a comprehensive approach of addressing health literacy needs of the elderly.

===Health illiterate-related diabetes prevalence in Vietnamese-American populations===
Diabetes is a rapidly growing health problem among immigrants—affecting approximately 10 percent of Asian-Americans.  It is the fifth-leading cause of death in Asian-Americans between the ages of 45 and 64.  In addition, type 2 diabetes is the most common form of the disease.  Those who are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes have high levels of blood glucose because the body does not effectively respond to insulin.  It is a lifelong disease with no known cure.  Diabetes is a chronic, debilitating, and costly social burden—costing healthcare systems about $100 billion annually.&lt;ref name="Cabiglio"&gt;Cabiglio, Josie. Diabetes on the rise among Asians.

Diabetes disproportionately affects underserved and ethnically diverse populations, such as Vietnamese-American communities.  The relationship between the disease and health literacy level is in part because of an individual's ability to read English, evaluate blood glucose levels, and communicate with medical professionals.  Other studies also suggest lack in knowledge of diabetes symptoms and complications.&lt;ref name="Glazier"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Glazier R.H. | year = 2004 | title = Neighborhood recent immigration and hospitalization in Toronto, Canada | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Public Health | volume = 95 | issue = | pages = 130–134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to an observational cross-sectional study conducted, many Vietnamese-American diabetic patients show signs of poor blood glucose control and adherence due to inadequate self-management knowledge and experience.&lt;ref name="Mull"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mull Dorothy S.

==== Oral health literacy in school teachers of Mangalore, India ====
The problem of low oral health literacy (OHL) is often neglected which may lead to poor oral health outcomes and under utilization of oral care services. A cross-sectional survey of  school teachers working in schools at Mangalore, India was undertaken. Details regarding demographics, medical, and dental history, oral hygiene practices and habits, diet history, and decay promoting the potential of school teachers were obtained using face-to-face interview method. The Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Dentistry-99 (REALD-99) was used to assess their OHL.The OHL was high in the school teachers with the REALD-99 scores ranging from 45 to 95 with a mean score of 75.83 ± 9.94. Th This study found that there was a statistically significant difference between OHL and education, frequency of brushing and the filled teeth. Although this study indicated high OHL levels among school teachers in Mangalore, India the magnitude of dental caries in this population was also relatively high and very few had a healthy periodontium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simon|first=Arun K|last2=Rao|first2=Ashwini|last3=Rajesh|first3=GuruRaghavendran|last4=Shenoy|first4=Ramya|last5=Pai|first5=Mithun B.

==eHealth literacy==
eHealth literacy describes the relatively modern concept of an individual's ability to search for, successfully access, comprehend, and appraise desired health information from electronic sources and to then use such information to attempt to address a particular health problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jmir.org/2006/2/e9/|title=eHealth Literacy: Essential Skills for Consumer Health in a Networked World|first1=Cameron D|last1=Norman|first2=Harvey A|last2=Skinner|date=1 January 2006|publisher=|volume=8|issue=2|doi=10.2196/jmir.8.2.e9|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|page=e9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the increasing influence of the internet for information-seeking and health information distribution purposes, eHealth literacy has become an important topic of research in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayat|first=T|last2=Brainin|first2=E|last3=Neter|first3=E|date=|title=With Some Help From My Network: Supplementing eHealth Literacy With Social Ties|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|volume=19|issue=3|pages=e98.|doi=10.2196/jmir.6472|via=|pmc=5391437|pmid=28360024|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stellefson (2011) states, "8 out of 10 Internet users report that they have at least once looked online for health information, making it the third most popular Web activity next to checking email and using search engines in terms of activities that almost everybody has done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jmir.org/2011/4/e102/|title=eHealth Literacy Among College Students: A Systematic Review With Implications for eHealth Education|first1=Michael|last1=Stellefson|first2=Bruce|last2=Hanik|first3=Beth|last3=Chaney|first4=Don|last4=Chaney|first5=Bethany|last5=Tennant|first6=Enmanuel Antonio|last6=Chavarria|date=1 January 2011|publisher=|volume=13|issue=4|doi=10.2196/jmir.1703|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|page=e102}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though in recent years, individuals may have gained access to a multitude of health information via the Internet, access alone does not ensure that proper search skills and techniques are being used to find the most relevant online and electronic resources. As the line between a reputable medical source and an amateur opinion can often be blurred, the ability to differentiate between the two is important.

Health literacy requires a combination of several different literacy skills in order to facilitate eHealth promotion and care.  Six core skills are delineated by an eHealth literacy model referred to as the Lily model.  The Lily Model's six literacies are organized into two central types: analytic and context-specific.  Analytic type literacies are those skills that can be applied to a broad range of sources, regardless of topic or content (i.e., skills that can also be applied to shopping or researching a term paper in addition to health) whereas context-specific skills are those that are contextualized within a specific problem domain (can solely be applied to health).  The six literacies are listed below, the first three of the analytic type and the latter three of the context-specific:
* Traditional literacy
* Media literacy
* Information literacy
* Computer literacy
* Scientific literacy
* Health literacy

According to Norman (2006), both analytical and context-specific literacy skills are "required to fully engage with electronic health resources."  As the World Wide Web and technological innovations are more and more becoming a part of the healthcare environment, it is important for information technology to be properly utilized to promote health and deliver health care effectively. Furthermore, it was argued by Hayat Brainin &amp; Neter (2017), that digital media fosters the creation of interpersonal ties, that can supplement eHealth literacy. According to Hayat Brainin &amp; Neter (2017), individuals with low eHealth literacy who were able to recruit help when performing online activities demonstrated higher health outcomes compared to similar individuals who did not find help. Also relating to the proliferation of digital media is the fact that many individuals now can create their own ‘media content’ ([[user-generated content]]). This means that the boundary between “information” and “media” content, as proposed by Norman in 2006, now is increasingly blurred, creating additional challenges for health practitioners (Holmberg, 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Holmberg C | year = 2016 | title = If You can't beat It-Use It: why and how clinicians need to consider social media in the treatment of adolescents with obesity | url = | journal = European Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 70 | issue = 9| pages = 977–8 | doi = 10.1038/ejcn.2016.126 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that the move towards [[Patient-centred care|patient-centered care]] and the greater use of technology for self-care and self-management requires higher health literacy on the part of the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Henna|last2=Xie|first2=Bo|title=Health literacy in the eHealth era: A systematic review of the literature|journal=Patient Education and Counseling|date=January 2017|doi=10.1016/j.pec.2017.01.015|volume=100|pages=1073–1082}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been noted in several research studies, for example among adolescent patients with obesity.&lt;ref&gt;Holmberg, C., Berg, C., Dahlgren, J., Lissner, L., &amp; Chaplin, J. E. (2018). Health literacy in a complex digital media landscape: Pediatric obesity patients’ experiences with online weight, food, and health information. Health Informatics Journal.

== Improvement ==

=== Incorporate information through the university level ===
The [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] created a National Action Plan to Improve Health Literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.gov/communication/hlactionplan/pdf/Health_Literacy_Action_Plan.pdf|title=National Action Plan to Improve Health Literacy|date=|accessdate=|website=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the goals of the National Action Plan is to incorporate health and science information in childcare and education through the university level. The target is to educate people at an early stage; that way individuals are raised with health literacy and will have a better quality of life. The earlier an individual is exposed to health literacy skills the better for the person and the community.

Programs such as Head Start&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ohs|title=Home - Office of Head Start - Administration for Children and Families|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) - Food and Nutrition Service|url=http://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/women-infants-and-children-wic|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have impacted our society, especially the low income population. Head Start provides low-income children and their families early childhood education, nutrition, and health screenings. Health literacy is integrated in the program for both children and parents through the education given to the individuals. WIC serves low-income pregnant women and new mothers by supplying them with food, health care referrals, and nutrition education. Programs like these help improve the health literacy of both the parent and the child, creating a more knowledgeable community with health education.

Although programs like Head Start and WIC have been working with the health literacy of a specific population, much more can be done with the education of children and young adults. Now, more and more adolescents are getting involved with their health care. It is crucial to educate these individuals in order for them to make informed decisions.

Many schools in the country incorporate a health class in their curriculum. These classes provided an excellent opportunity to facilitate and develop health literacy in today's children and adolescents. The skills of how to read food labels, the meaning of common medical terms, the structure of the human body, and education on the most prevalent diseases in the United States should be taught in both private and public schools. This way new generations will grow with health literacy and would hopefully make knowledgeable health decisions.

=== Framework and potential intervention points ===
The National Library of Medicine defines health literacy as:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=|title=Health Literacy: A Prescription to End Confustion|last=Nielsen-Bohlmn|first=Lynn|date=2004|journal=Institute of Medicine|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"The degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health literacy
information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions."}}

Based on this clinical definition, health literacy gives
individuals the skills that they need to both understand and effectively
communicate information and concerns. Bridging that gap between literacy skills
and the ability of the individual in health contexts, the ''Health Literacy Framework'' highlights the health outcomes and costs
associated with health contexts including cognitive abilities, social skills,
emotional state, and physical conditions such as visual and auditory contributions.

''Potential Intervention Points'' are illustrated in reflection of the ''Health Literacy Framework.''
While these potential intervention points include interactions such as those of individuals and the education systems
that they are engaged with, their health systems, and societal factors as they
relate to health literacy, these points are not 
components of a causal model.  The three
potential intervention points are culture and society, the health system, and
the education system. Health outcomes and costs are the products of the health
literacy developed during diversity of exposure to these three potential intervention
points.

Referring to shared ideas, meanings, and values that
influence an individual's beliefs and attitudes, cultural and societal
influences are a significant intervention point for health literacy
development. As interactions with healthcare systems often first occur at the
family level, deeply rooted beliefs and values can shape the significance of
the experience. Included components that reflect the development of health
literacy both culturally and societally are native language, socioeconomic status,
gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as mass media exposure. These
are pathways to understanding American life paralleling conquests for a health
literate America.

The health system is an intervention point in the ''Health Literacy Framework''. For the
purposes of this framework, health literacy refers to an individual's
interaction with people performing health-related activities in settings such
as hospitals, clinics, physician's offices, home health care, public health agencies,
and insurers.

In the United States, the education system consists of [[K-12]] curricula. In addition to this standard educational
setting, adult education programs are also environments in which individuals
can develop traditional literacy skills founded in comprehension and real-world
application of knowledge via reading and writing.  Tools for educational development provided by
these systems impact an individual's capacity to obtain specific knowledge
regarding health. Reflecting components of traditional literacy such as
cultural and conceptual knowledge, oral literacy (listening and speaking,)
print literacy (reading and writing,) and numeracy, education systems are also
potential intervention points for health literacy development.

=== Development of a health literacy program ===
A successful health literacy program will have many goals that all work together to improve health literacy. Many people assume these goals should communicate health information to the general public, however in order to be successful the goals should not only communicate with people but also take into account social and environmental factors that influence lifestyle choices.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nutbeam|first=D.|date=2000-09-01|title=Health literacy as a public health goal: a challenge for contemporary health education and communication strategies into the 21st century|url=https://academic.oup.com/heapro/article/15/3/259/551108/Health-literacy-as-a-public-health-goal-a|journal=Health Promotion International|language=en|volume=15|issue=3|pages=259–267|doi=10.1093/heapro/15.3.259|issn=0957-4824}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good example of this is the movement to end smoking. When a health literacy program is put into place where only the negative side effects of smoking are told to the general public it is doomed to fail. However, when there is a larger program put in – one that includes strategies outlining how to quit smoking, raises tobacco prices, reduces access to tobacco by minors, and reflect social a social unacceptability of smoking – it will be much more effective.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services suggests a National Action Plan to implement a comprehensive Health Literacy Program. They include 7 goals:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|first=Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion|date=2010|title=National Action Plan to Improve Health Literacy|url=https://health.gov/communication/hlactionplan/pdf/Health_Literacy_Action_Plan.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Develop and disseminate health and safety information that is accurate, accessible, and actionable
# Promote changes in the health care system that improve health information, communication, informed decision making, and access to health services
# Incorporate accurate, standards-based, and developmentally appropriate health and science information and curricula in child care and education through the university level
# Support and expand local efforts to provide adult education, English language instruction, and culturally and linguistically appropriate health information services in the community
# Build partnerships, develop guidance, and change policies
# Increase basic research and the development, implementation, and evaluation of practices and interventions to improve health literacy
# Increase the dissemination and use of evidence-based health literacy practices and interventions
These goals should be taken into account when implementing a health literacy program.

There are also goals for the outcomes of a Health Literacy Program.

''Health Related Goals''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Promoting and protect health and prevent disease
* Understand, interpret, and analyze health information
* Apply health information over a variety of life events and situations

===Libraries===
Libraries have increasingly recognised that they can play a role in health literacy since the 2000s, influenced by the [[Medical Library Association]].  Library initiatives have included running education programs, fostering partnerships with health organisations, and using outreach efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=13 June 2016|title=Health literacy and libraries: a literature review|journal=[[Reference Services Review]]|volume=44|issue=2|pages=191–205|doi=10.1108/RSR-02-2016-0005|last1=Barr-Walker|first1=Jill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3034">The '''Healthcare in Ukraine''' is part of [[universal health care]] system being a successor of the Soviet healthcare system. The [[Ministry of Healthcare (Ukraine)|Ministry of Healthcare]] implements the state policy in the country in the field of medicine and healthcare.

As of March 2009 the [[Ukrainian government]] planned on reforming the health care system, by the creation of a national network of [[family doctor]]s and improvements in the [[Emergency medical services|medical emergency services]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/11044/ National network of family doctors to be established by 2010, says health minister], [[Interfax|Interfax-Ukraine]] (March 30, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ukrainian Prime Minister]] [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] wanted (in November 2009) to start introducing a public healthcare system based on health insurance in the spring of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/53483/ Ukraine to start introducing insurance-based healthcare system in spring of 2010], [[Kyiv Post]] (November 24, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Further reform was promised by Health Minister [[Alexander Kvitashvili]] in 2014 but proposals failed to make political progress and he offered his resignation - which was not accepted.  State funding for hospitals cover only the electricity and meager staff salaries, leading to widespread bribery. Even hot water is a problem.  Charitable donations are needed to buy even basic medicines or fuel needed to visit patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ukraine health system in danger of collapse as reforms stall|url=http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0U60LN20151223|accessdate=5 October 2015|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ukrainian healthcare should be free to citizens according to law, but in practice patients contribute to the cost of most aspects of healthcare.&lt;ref name=politico-20170405&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.eu/article/ukraines-ailing-health-care-system-underfunded-corrupt-inaccessible/ |title=In Ukraine, health care is free (except when it's not) |first=Iuliia |last=Mendel |newspaper=POLITICO |date=5 April 2017 |accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Fats}}
'''Interesterified fat''' is a type of oil where the fatty acids have been moved from one [[triglyceride]] molecule to another. This is generally done to modify the [[melting point]], slow [[rancidification]] and create an oil more suitable for [[deep frying]] or making [[margarine]] with good taste and low saturated fat content. It is not the same as [[Hydrogenated oil|partial hydrogenation]] which produces [[trans fatty acid]]s, but interesterified fats used in the food industry can come from hydrogenated fat, for simplicity and [[frugality]].

==Chemistry==

Fats such as [[soybean oil]] consist mainly of various [[triglycerides]] which are made up of a [[glycerol]] backbone esterified to three fatty acid molecules.  The triglycerides contain a mixture of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Interesterification is carried out by blending the desired oils and then rearranging the fatty acids over the glycerol backbone with, for instance, the help of catalysts or [[lipase]] enzymes.&lt;ref name=ISEO /&gt; [[Polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s (PUFAs) decrease the melting point of fats significantly.  A triglyceride containing three saturated fatty acids is generally solid at room temperature and not very desirable for many applications. Rearranging these triglycerides with oils containing unsaturated fatty acids lowers the melting point and creates fats with properties better suited for target food products. In addition, blending interesterified oils with liquid oils allows the reduction in saturated fatty acids in many trans fatty acid free food products.  The interesterified fats can be separated through controlled crystallization, also called fractionation.&lt;ref name= Kellens&gt;

In vegetable polyunsaturated oils, the PUFA is commonly found at the middle position (sn2) on the glycerol.  Stearic acid is not usually found at sn2 in vegetable oils used in the human diet.&lt;ref name=ISEO&gt;{{cite web|title= Food Fats and oils

===Hypotheses===
{{technical|date=March 2014}}
In most vegetable dietary fats, the [[Palmitic acid|palmitic]] (C16:0) and [[stearic acid]] (C18:0) saturated fats mainly occupy the 1- and 3-positions of the [[triacylglycerol]] molecule, whereas an unsaturated fatty acid such as [[oleic acid]] (18:1ω9) or [[linoleic acid]] (18:2ω6) usually occupies the 2-position. In animal fats, this is not the case. Interesterification of vegetable oils will enhance the amount of saturated fatty acids at the 2-position. Fatty acids at the 2-position are biologically different from fatty acids at the 1 and 3 position because they are handled differently during digestion and metabolism, and a relevant scientific question is whether there are health effects following from this. Although this question has received relatively little attention in dietary fats and health research, there are a number of good controlled human intervention studies that have addressed it.

In studies addressing the health effects of interesterification as such, a diet high in interesterified fat should be compared with a diet high in a noninteresterified fat with the same fatty acid composition. If the two diets show similar changes in the resulting blood lipid profiles (i.e. not different from each other), this indicates interesterification has no effect on metabolism or biological effects.
Conversely, effects of interesterification cannot be properly addressed if the interesterified fat and the noninteresterified fat being compared have different fatty acid compositions.

===Individual studies===
Zock et al.&lt;ref name=Zock&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/reprint/61/1/48.pdf |vauthors=Zock PJ, de Vries JH, de Fouw NJ, Katan MB |title= Positional distribution of fatty acids in dietary triglycerides: effects on fasting blood lipoprotein concentrations in humans.|journal= Am J Clin Nutr |year= 1995 |volume=61|pages=48–551}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared the effects of an IE (interesterfied) test fat with 40% C16:0 on the 2-position with a noninteresterified test fat with only 6.5% C16:0 on the 2-position in a 3-week diet study. Despite the very high intakes and the marked difference in positional distribution, no statistically significant effects on fasting blood lipids were observed in the group as a whole. Nestel et al.&lt;ref name=Nestel&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/reprint/62/5/950.pdf  |vauthors=Nestel PJ, Noakes M, Belling GB, etal |title= Effect on plasma lipids of interesterifying a mix of edible oils.|journal= Am J Clin Nutr |year= 1995 |volume= 62 |pages= 950–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined the effects of an IE fat blend with 25% C16:0 on the 2-position with a native fat blend with only 9% C16:0 on the 2-position. Again, despite a high intake level and the clear difference in positional distribution of the fats fed, no effects were observed on fasting blood lipids. Meijer and Weststrate&lt;ref name=Meijer&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v51/n8/pdf/1600437a.pdf |vauthors=Meijer GW, Weststrate JA |title=Interesterification of fats in margarine: effect on blood lipids, blood enzymes and hemostasis parameters. |journal=Eur J Clin Nutr |year=1997 |volume= 51 |pages=527–34 |doi=10.1038/sj.ejcn.1600437}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined the effects of interesterification, using a 'real' hardstock as applied in foods. The control was the same fat blend with a similar fatty acid composition, but not interesterified. The IE fat blend contained more C16:0 on the 2-position (18%) than the control blend (7%). None of the fasting levels of blood lipids measured after 3 weeks showed any change related to treatment of the fat blend. Fasting glucose level was also not affected.

In 1970, Grande et al.&lt;ref name= Grande&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/reprint/23/9/1184.pdf |vauthors=Grande F, Anderson JT, Keys A |title= Comparison of effects of palmitic and stearic acids in the diet on serum cholesterol in man. |journal= Am J Clin Nutr |year= 1970 |volume=23 | issue=9 |pages= 1184–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; used interesterification to prepare a blend of fats and oils mimicking the fatty acid composition of cocoa butter. No difference between the interesterified fat blend and cocoa butter was observed in levels of total cholesterol in fasting blood.

Recently, in a study funded by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board, Sundram et al.&lt;ref name=NutrMetab&gt;{{cite journal
 | url=http://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/pdf/1743-7075-4-3.pdf
 |vauthors=Sundram K, Karupaiah T, Hayes K |title= Stearic acid-rich interesterified fat and trans-rich fat raise the LDL/HDL ratio and plasma glucose relative to palm olein in humans |journal= Nutr Metab |year= 2007|doi=10.1186/1743-7075-4-3|accessdate=2007-01-19 |volume= 4 |pages= 3
 | pmid=17224066
 | pmc=1783656}}&lt;/ref&gt;  compared the effects of three types of fat: native palm olein, a blend with partially hydrogenated soybean oil and an interesterified mixture of oils. They concluded both the IE blend and the partially hydrogenated fat blend increased the fasting ratio of [[low-density lipoprotein|LDL]] to [[high-density lipoprotein|HDL]] cholesterol, indicating an adverse effect on CVD risk. Sundram et al. also found that fasting plasma glucose levels were higher after 4 weeks on the interesterified fat than after the other diets. For the postprandial study the glucose incremental area under the curve (IAUC) following the IE meal was 40% greater than after either other meal (p&lt;0.001), and was linked to relatively depressed insulin and C-peptide (p&lt;0.05). As was pointed out in a letter to the Editor by Destaillats et al.,&lt;ref name=Dest&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/4/1/10 |vauthors=Destaillats F, Moulin J, Bezelgues JB |title= Letter to the editor: healthy alternatives to trans fats |journal=Nutr and Metab|year=2007 |volume= 4 |pages= 10 |doi=10.1186/1743-7075-4-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; a major limitation of the Sundram study is that the diets differed in overall fatty acid composition. The interesterified fat had 30% more saturated and 57% less monounsaturated fatty acids than the untreated palm olein. The direction of the effects on blood lipids are in line with what can be predicted based on these differences in fatty acid content between the study diets (Mensink 2003).&lt;ref name=Mensink&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/reprint/77/5/1146.pdf |vauthors= Mensink RP, Zock PL, Kester AD, Katan MB |title= Effects of dietary fatty acids and carbohydrates on the ratio of serum total to HDL cholesterol and on serum lipids and apolipoproteins: a meta-analysis of 60 controlled trials.|journal= Am J Clin Nutr |year= 2003 |volume=77| issue=5 |pages= 1146–1155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another recent study by Berry et al.&lt;ref name=berry1&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/reprint/85/6/1486.pdf |vauthors=Berry SE, Miller GJ, Sanders TA |title= The solid fat content of stearic acid-rich fats determines their postprandial effects. |journal= Am J Clin Nutr |year= 2007 |volume= 85 |pages=1486–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared shea butter (3% C18:0 on the 2-position) and interesterified shea butter (23% C18:0 on the 2-position), while keeping overall fatty acid composition of the diets constant. This study found no effects of interesterification on fasting levels of blood lipids, glucose and insulin. This is line with a number of other human intervention studies.&lt;ref name=Zampelas&gt;{{citation |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=1812280&amp;jid=&amp;volumeId=&amp;issueId=03&amp;aid=1812272&amp;bodyId=&amp;membershipNumber=&amp;societyETOCSession=  |vauthors=Zampelas A, Williams CM, Morgan LM, etal |title= The effect of triacylglycerol fatty acids positional distribution on postprandial plasma metabolite and hormone responses in normal adult men. |journal= Br J Nutr |year=1994 |volume= 71 |pages=401–10 |doi=10.1079/bjn19940147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Yli&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.jlr.org/cgi/reprint/42/10/1618.pdf  |vauthors=Yli-Jokipii K, Kallio H, Schwab U, etal |title= Effects of palm oil and transesterified palm oil on chylomicron and VLDL triacylglycerol structures and postprandial lipid response.|journal= J Lipid Res |year= 2001 |volume= 42 |pages=1618–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=berry2&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/p5475646700v5114/fulltext.html |vauthors=Berry SE, Woodward R, Yeoh C, Miller GJ, Sanders TA |title=Effect of interesterification of palmitic-acid rich tryacylglycerol on postprandial lipid and factor VII response |journal= Lipids |year=2007|volume=42|pages=315–323 |doi=10.1007/s11745-007-3024-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=summer&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.jlr.org/cgi/reprint/40/10/1890.pdf  |vauthors=Summers LK, Fielding BA, Herd SL, etal |title=Use of structured triacylglycerols containing predominantly stearic and oleic acids to probe early events in metabolic processing of dietary fat|journal=J Lipid Res|year= 1999|volume= 40|pages=1890–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christophe et al. have studied the effect of interesterification of butter oil.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6934">The '''Israeli paradox'''  is a [[catchphrase]], first used in 1996, to summarize the apparently paradoxical [[epidemiological]] observation that [[Israeli Jews]] have a relatively high [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of [[coronary heart disease]] (CHD), despite having a diet relatively low in [[saturated fat]]s, in apparent contradiction to the [[Saturated fat and cardiovascular disease controversy|widely held belief that the high consumption of such fats is a risk factor for CHD]].  The paradox is that if the thesis linking saturated fats to CHD is valid, the Israelis ought to have a lower rate of CHD than comparable countries where the per capita consumption of such fats is higher.

The observation of Israel's paradoxically high rate of CHD is one of a number of paradoxical outcomes for which a literature now exists, regarding the thesis that a high consumption of saturated fats ought to lead to an increase in CHD incidence, and that a lower consumption ought to lead to the reverse outcome. The most famous of these paradoxes is known as the "[[French paradox]]": France enjoys a relatively low incidence of CHD despite a high per-capita consumption of saturated fat.

The Israeli paradox implies two important possibilities. The first is that the hypothesis linking saturated fats to CHD is not completely valid (or, at the extreme, is entirely invalid). The second possibility is that the link between saturated fats and CHD is valid, but that some additional factor in the typical Israeli diet, lifestyle or genes creates another CHD risk—presumably with the implication that if this factor can be identified, it can be isolated in the diet and / or lifestyle of other countries, thereby allowing both the Israelis, and others, to avoid that particular risk.

==Quantifying the Israeli paradox==
Israeli Jews eat a diet which is richer in linoleic acid (the most readily available plant-based form of omega-6 fatty acid, found in many vegetable oils) than any other population on the planet. Average per capita consumption is approximately 30 grams a day (11 kilograms annually),&lt;ref&gt;Susan Allport, ''The Queen Of Fats: Why Omega-3s Were Removed From The Western Diet And What We Can Do To Replace Them''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2006, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; compared to 25 grams daily for the average American in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Allport, ''The Queen Of Fats: Why Omega-3s Were Removed From The Western Diet And What We Can Do To Replace Them''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2006, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Susan Allport summarizes the Israeli paradox in the following words: 
{{cquote|Israelis eat less animal fat and cholesterol and fewer calories than Americans, but they have comparable rates of heart disease, obesity, diabetes and many cancers. They have an ideal diet, as far as the American food pyramid is concerned, but far from ideal health.”&lt;ref&gt;Susan Allport, ''The Queen Of Fats: Why Omega-3s Were Removed From The Western Diet And What We Can Do To Replace Them''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2006, pp. 107-108.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Allport notes that “Little butter is consumed in Israel, but large quantities of soybean, corn and safflower oil are….This translates, researchers estimate, to a linoleic acid intake of about 11 percent of calories and a ratio of linoleic to alpha linolenic acid [the most readily-available plant-based omega-3 fatty acid] in the Israeli diet of about 26:1.”&lt;ref&gt;Susan Allport, ''The Queen Of Fats: Why Omega-3s Were Removed From The Western Diet And What We Can Do To Replace Them''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2006, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; She observes that mean serum cholesterol in Israel is quite low by the standards of developed countries: 210 milligrams/dl. Therefore, one distinction that can, without controversy, be attributed to the high levels of linoleic acid in the Israeli diet is the high percentage of linoleic acid in the adipose tissue of Israelis: 24% as compared to 16% in Americans and less than 10% in many northern Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Allport, ''The Queen Of Fats: Why Omega-3s Were Removed From The Western Diet And What We Can Do To Replace Them''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2006, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, a 23-year follow-up study to the Israeli Ischemic Heart Disease Study of ten thousand public service employees (widely referred to as the “Israeli Civil Service Study”&lt;ref&gt;Nina Teicholz, ''The Big Fat Surprise: Why Butter, Meat and Cheese Belong in a Healthy Diet'' New York: Simon and Schuster, 2014, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;) found that there were only “weak associations of long-term coronary mortality with the dietary intake patterns of fatty acids.”&lt;ref&gt;U. Goldbourt et al., “Factors Predictive of Long-Term Coronary Heart Disease Mortality Among 10,059 Male Israeli Civil Servants and Municipal Employees: A 23-Year Mortality Follow-up to the Israeli Ischemic Heart Disease Study.” ''Cardiology'' 82 (1993), 100-121.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identifying and naming the Israeli paradox==
The term "Israeli Paradox" was first used by researchers Daniel Yam, Abraham Eliraz and Elliot Berry in a 1996 article in the ''Israel Journal of Medical Sciences''.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Yam, Abraham Eliraz and Elliot Berry, “Diet and Disease—The Israeli Paradox: Possible Dangers of a High Omega-6 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Diet” in ''Israel Journal of Medical Sciences'' 32 (1996): 1134-43.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors observed that Israelis consumed polyunsaturated fatty acids (primarily omega-6s rather than omega-3s)  at a rate about 8% higher than in the United States and about 10-12% higher than most of Europe. They wrote, “Israeli Jews may be regarded as a population-based dietary experiment of the effect of a high omega-6 PUFA [polyunsaturated fatty acid] diet.”

The most readily-observable result of the relatively high ratio of omega-6 fats to saturated fats in the Israeli diet was the deposition of omega-6 fats in preference to saturated fats in the adipose tissue of Israelis. This had been observed as early as 1976, when an article in the ''Israel Journal of Medical Sciences'' noted that, counting polyunsaturated fats (which includes both omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids) as a whole, the ratio of polyunsaturated fats to saturated fats in the adipose tissue of Ashkenazi Jews in Israel was 0.88:1, while for non-Ashkenazi Jews it was 1.13:1. This was, according to the authors, “the highest reported for any population on a free-choice diet.”&lt;ref&gt;SH Blondheim et al., “Unsaturated Fatty Acids in the Adipose Tissue of Israeli Jews” in ''Israel Journal of Medical Sciences'' 12 (1976): 658.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kegel exercise''', also known as '''pelvic floor exercise''', consists of repeatedly contracting and relaxing the muscles that form part of the [[pelvic floor]], now sometimes colloquially referred to as the "Kegel muscles". The exercise can be performed multiple times each day, for several minutes at a time, for one to three months, to begin to have an effect.

Kegel exercises can make the pelvic floor muscles stronger. These are the muscles that hold up the bladder and help keep it from leaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/urologic-diseases/bladder-control-problems-women/kegel-exercises|title=Kegel Exercises {{!}} NIDDK|work=National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases|access-date=2017-12-02|language=en-US}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003975.htm|title=Pelvic floor muscle training exercises: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exercises are usually done to reduce [[Stress incontinence|urinary stress incontinence]] (especially after childbirth) and reduce [[premature ejaculation]] in men.&lt;ref name="autogenerated22"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Nicastro|first2=A|year=1996|title=A new treatment for premature ejaculation: the rehabilitation of the pelvic floor|journal=Journal of sex &amp; marital therapy|volume=22|issue=1|pages=22–6|doi=10.1080/00926239608405302|pmid=8699493|last1=La Pera|first1=G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Several tools exist to help with these exercises, although various studies debate the relative effectiveness of different tools versus traditional exercises.&lt;ref name="bjui.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bjui.org/ContentFullItem.aspx?id=427&amp;LinkTypeID=1&amp;SectionType=4 |title=A randomised controlled trial of the PelvicToner Device in female stress urinary incontinence |publisher=BJUI.org |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were first described in 1948 by American gynecologist [[Arnold Kegel]].

==Health effects==
Factors such as [[pregnancy]], [[childbirth]], aging, being [[overweight]], and abdominal surgery such as cesarean section, often result in the weakening of the pelvic muscles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/pelvic-floor|title=Pelvic floor|last=Services|first=Department of Health &amp; Human|access-date=2018-02-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be assessed by either digital examination of vaginal pressure or using a Kegel [[perineometer]]. Kegel exercises are useful in regaining pelvic floor muscle strength in such cases.

===Urinary health===
Pelvic floor exercises (muscle training) can be included in conservative treatment approaches for women with [[urinary incontinence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dumoulin|first=Chantale|last2=Cacciari|first2=Licia P.|last3=Hay-Smith|first3=E.

===Pelvic prolapse===
The symptoms of [[Prolapse#Pelvic floor prolapse|prolapse]] and its severity can be decreased with pelvic floor exercises.&lt;ref name="pmid22161382"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hagen S, Stark D |title=Conservative prevention and management of pelvic organ prolapse in women |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=12 |issue= 12|pages=CD003882 |year=2011 |pmid=22161382 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003882.pub4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/urologic-diseases/bladder-control-problems-women/cystocele-prolapsed-bladder|title=Cystocele (Prolapsed Bladder) {{!}} NIDDK|work=National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases|access-date=2017-12-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effectiveness can be improved with feedback on how to do the exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herderschee|first1=R|last2=Hay-Smith|first2=EJ|last3=Herbison|first3=GP|last4=Roovers|first4=JP|last5=Heineman|first5=MJ|title=Feedback or biofeedback to augment pelvic floor muscle training for urinary incontinence in women.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=6 July 2011|issue=7|pages=CD009252|pmid=21735442|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism of action==
The aim of Kegel exercises is to improve [[muscle tone]] by strengthening the [[pubococcygeus muscle]]s of the [[pelvic floor]]. Kegel is a popular prescribed exercise for pregnant women to prepare the [[pelvic floor]] for physiological stresses of the later stages of [[pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]]. Kegel exercises are said to be good for treating [[vaginal prolapse]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=September 2, 2011 |url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/vaginal_prolapse/article_em.htm |title=Vaginal Prolapse |publisher=eMedicineHealth |date=2011-02-09 |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and preventing [[uterine prolapse]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001508.htm#Prevention |title=MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia: Uterine prolapse |publisher=Nlm.nih.gov |date=2011-08-29 |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; in women and for treating [[prostate]] pain and swelling resulting from [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]] (BPH) and [[prostatitis]] in men. Kegel exercises may be beneficial in treating [[urinary incontinence]] in both men and women.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003975.htm|title=MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia: Kegel exercises|date=2011-08-29|publisher=Nlm.nih.gov|accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kegel exercises may also increase sexual gratification, allowing women to complete [[pompoir]] and aid in reducing [[premature ejaculation]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated22"/&gt; in men. The many actions performed by Kegel muscles include holding in urine and avoiding defecation. Reproducing this type of muscle action can strengthen the Kegel muscles. The action of slowing or stopping the flow of urine may be used as a test of correct pelvic floor exercise technique.&lt;ref&gt;Kenway, M., and Goh, J. (2009). ''Inside Out: The Essential Women's Guide to Pelvic Support''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is now known that the components of levator ani (the pelvic diaphragm), namely pubococcygeus, puborectalis and ileococcygeus, contract and relax as one muscle. Hence, pelvic floor exercises involve the entire levator ani rather than pubococcygeus alone. Pelvic floor exercises may be of benefit in cases of [[fecal incontinence]] and pelvic organ prolapse conditions e.g. [[rectal prolapse]].&lt;ref name="Bø 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bø|first=K|title=Can pelvic floor muscle training prevent and treat pelvic organ prolapse?|journal=Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand|year=2006|volume=85|issue=3|pages=263–8|pmid=16553172|doi=10.1080/00016340500486800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pelvic toning devices==
[[Image:Kegel exerciser.JPG|thumb|A Kegel exerciser]]
Some devices have been marketed to women exercise their pelvic floor muscle and improve the muscle tone of the pubococcygeal or vaginal muscle.
[[File:Jade Eggs usually come in 3 different sizes.jpg|thumb|250px|Jade eggs (or Yoni eggs) have been marketed for use in vaginal weightlifting.]]
[[File:Ben Wa Balls.jpg|thumb|[[Ben wa balls]]]]

As of 2013 there was no evidence that doing pelvic floor exercise with weights worked better than doing Kegel exercises without weights; there is greater risk with weights, because a foreign object is introduced into the vagina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herbison|first1=GP|last2=Dean|first2=N|title=Weighted vaginal cones for urinary incontinence|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=8 July 2013|issue=7|pages=CD002114|pmid=23836411|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002114.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bjui.org" /&gt;

Inserting foreign objects into the vagina increases the risk of infections and can lead to [[vaginosis]] or [[toxic shock syndrome]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Overuse of such Kegel exercises, with or without a device, can lead to pelvic pain and pain during sex.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://drjengunter.wordpress.com/2017/01/17/dear-gwyneth-paltrow-im-a-gyn-and-your-vaginal-jade-eggs-are-a-bad-idea/|title=Dear Gwyneth Paltrow, I’m a GYN and your vaginal jade eggs are a bad idea|last=Gunter|first=Jen|date=2017-01-17|website=Dr. Jen Gunter|access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marketing===
During the latter part of the 20th century, a number of medical and pseudo-medical devices were marketed to consumers as improving sex or orgasms, increasing "[[Energy (esotericism)|energy]]", "balancing hormones", and as having other health or lifestyle benefits. There  is no evidence for any of these claims, and many of them are pseudoscience.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="skeptical"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tuteur |first1=Amy |title=Vaginal weight lifting |url=http://www.skepticalob.com/2008/12/vaginal-weight-lifting.html |work=The Skeptical OB |date=18 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref nam°e=":1"&gt;{{cite news|title=No, Gwyneth Paltrow, women should not put jade eggs in their vaginas, gynecologist says|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/01/22/no-gwyneth-paltrow-women-should-not-put-jade-eggs-in-their-vaginas-gynecologist-says/|accessdate=6 February 2017|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19056">Many [[laboratories]] contain significant risks, and the prevention of '''laboratory accidents''' requires great care and constant vigilance. Examples of risk factors include high voltages, high and low pressures and temperatures, corrosive and toxic chemicals, and [[biohazard]]s including infective organisms and their toxins.

Measures to protect against laboratory accidents include safety training and enforcement of laboratory safety policies, safety review of experimental designs, the use of [[personal protective equipment]], and the use of the [[buddy system]] for particularly risky operations.

In many countries, laboratory work is subject by health and safety legislation. In some cases, laboratory activities can also present [[environmental health]] risks, for example, the accidental or deliberate discharge of toxic or infective material from the laboratory into the environment.

== Chemical hazards ==
Hazardous [[chemicals]] present physical and/or health threats to workers in clinical, industrial, and academic laboratories. Laboratory chemicals include [[cancer]]-causing agents (carcinogens), toxins (e.g., those affecting the [[liver]], [[kidney]], and [[nervous system]]), irritants, corrosives, sensitizers, as well as agents that act on the blood system or damage the [[lungs]], [[skin]], [[eye]]s, or [[mucous membrane]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sp.ehs.cornell.edu/lab-research-safety/laboratory-safety-manual/Pages/ch8.aspx|title = Chapter 8 - Chemical Hazards|website = sp.ehs.cornell.edu|access-date = 2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biological hazards ==
[[File:Biohazard symbol (black and yellow).png|thumb|Biohazard symbol (black and yellow)]]

=== Biological agents and biological toxins ===
Many laboratory workers encounter daily exposure to biological hazards. These hazards are present in various sources throughout the laboratory such as [[blood]] and [[body fluids]], culture specimens, [[body tissue]] and [[cadavers]], and [[laboratory animals]], as well as other workers.

These are federally regulated biological agents (e.g., [[viruses]], [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], and [[prions]]) and toxins that have the potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety, to animal or plant health, or to animal or plant products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/biologicalagents/index.html | title=Biological Agents and Biological Toxins | publisher=[[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] | accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.osha.gov/dsg/topics/pandemicflu/index.html | title=An additional OSHA Safety and Health Topics page on Pandemic Influenza has been added in response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. | publisher=[[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] | accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#'''[[Anthrax]]''' - Anthrax is an acute infectious disease caused by a spore-forming bacterium called ''Bacillus anthracis''.
#'''Avian Flu''' - [[Avian influenza]] is caused by ''Influenza A viruses''.
#'''[[Botulism]]''' - Cases of botulism are usually associated with consumption of preserved foods.
#'''Foodborne Disease''' - Foodborne illnesses are caused by [[viruses]], [[bacteria]], [[parasites]], toxins, [[metals]], and [[prions]] (microscopic protein particles). Symptoms range from mild gastroenteritis to life-threatening neurologic, hepatic and renal syndromes.
#'''Hantavirus''' - Hantaviruses are transmitted to humans from the dried droppings, urine, or saliva of mice and rats.
#'''Legionnaires’ Disease''' - Legionnaires’ disease is a bacterial disease commonly associated with water-based aerosols.
#'''[[Molds]] and [[Fungi]]''' - Molds and fungi produce and release millions of spores small enough to be [[air]], [[water]], or insect-borne which may have negative effects on human health including, allergic reactions, asthma, and other respiratory problems.
#'''[[Plague (disease)|Plague]]''' - The [[World Health Organization]] reports 1,000 to 3,000 cases of plague every year. A bioterrorist release of plague could result in a rapid spread of the pneumonic form of the disease, which could have devastating consequences.
#'''Ricin''' - Ricin is one of the most toxic and easily produced plant toxins. It has been used in the past as a bioterrorist weapon and remains a serious threat.
#'''[[Smallpox]]''' - Smallpox is a highly contagious disease unique to humans. It is estimated that no more than 20 percent of the population has any immunity from previous vaccination.
#'''[[Tularemia]]''' - Tularemia is also known as "rabbit fever" or "deer fly fever" and is extremely infectious. Relatively few bacteria are required to cause the disease, which is why it is an attractive weapon for use in bioterrorism.

== Physical hazards and others ==
Besides exposure to chemicals and biological agents, laboratory workers can also be exposed to a number of physical hazards. Some of the common physical hazards that they may encounter include the following: [[ergonomic]], [[ionizing radiation]], non-ionizing
radiation and noise hazards.

=== Ergonomic Hazards ===
Laboratory workers are at risk for repetitive motion injuries during routine laboratory procedures such as pipetting, working at microscopes, operating microtomes, using cell counters and keyboarding at computer workstations. Repetitive motion injuries develop over time and occur when muscles and joints are stressed, tendons are inflamed, nerves are pinched and the flow of blood is restricted. Standing and working in awkward positions in front of laboratory hoods/biological safety cabinets can also present ergonomic problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.osha.gov/Publications/laboratory/OSHAfactsheet-laboratory-safety-ergonomics.pdf | title=Laboratory Safety – Ergonomics for the Prevention of Musculoskeletal Disorders | publisher=OSHA | accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darragh AR, Harrison H, Kenny S. Effect of ergonomics intervention on workstations of microscope workers. American Journal of Occupational Therapy. 2008. 62:61-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ionizing Radiation ===
[[File:ISO 7010 W003.svg|thumb|Danger radiation zone warning sign]]
Ionizing radiation sources are found in a wide range of occupational settings, including laboratories. These radiation sources can pose a considerable health risk to affected workers if not properly controlled. Any laboratory possessing or using radioactive isotopes must be licensed by the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) and/or by a state agency that has been approved by the NRC, 10 CFR 31.11 and 10 CFR 35.12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/radiationionizing/index.html | title=Ionizing Radiation | accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamental objectives of radiation protection measures are:

#to limit entry of radionuclides into the [[human body]] (via [[ingestion]], [[inhalation]], [[absorption (skin)|absorption]], or through open wounds) to quantities as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) and always within the established limits;

#to limit exposure to external radiation to levels that are within established dose limits and as far below these limits as is reasonably achievable.

== Safety hazards ==

=== Autoclaves and sterilizers === 
Workers should be trained to recognize the potential for exposure to burns or cuts that can occur from handling or sorting hot sterilized items or sharp instruments when removing them from '''[[autoclaves]]'''/'''[[sterilizers]]''' or from steam lines that service the autoclaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.osha.gov | title=An OSHA QuickFacts entitled '''Laboratory Safety – Autoclaves/Sterilizers''' has been developed to sup-plement this section and is available online at osha.gov. | accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Centrifuges ===
'''[[Centrifuges]]''', due to the high speed at which they operate, have great potential for injuring users if not operated properly. Unbalanced centrifuge rotors can result in injury, even death. Sample container breakage can generate aerosols that may be harmful if inhaled.
The majority of all centrifuge accidents are the result of user error.

=== Compressed gases ===
[[File:Compressed gas cylinders.mapp and oxygen.triddle.jpg|thumb|Compressed gas cylinders.mapp and oxygen.triddle]]
Laboratory standard for '''[[compressed gas]]'''
# Is a gas or mixture of gases in a container having an absolute pressure exceeding 40 pounds per square inch (psi) at 70&amp;nbsp;°F (21.1&amp;nbsp;°C); or&lt;ref name="compressed gas streamline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asu.edu/uagc/EHS/power_point/compressed_gas_streamline.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206164546/http://www.asu.edu/uagc/EHS/power_point/compressed_gas_streamline.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Is a gas or mixture of gases having an absolute pressure exceeding 104 psi at 130&amp;nbsp;°F (54.4&amp;nbsp;°C) regardless of the pressure at 70&amp;nbsp;°F (21.1&amp;nbsp;°C); or&lt;ref name="compressed gas streamline" /&gt; 
# Is a liquid having a vapor pressure exceeding 40 psi at 100&amp;nbsp;°F (37.8&amp;nbsp;°C) as determined by ASTM ([[American Society for Testing and Materials]])

Within laboratories, compressed gases are usually supplied either through fixed piped gas systems or individual cylinders of gases. Compressed gases can be [[toxic]], [[flammable]], [[oxidizing]], [[corrosive]], or [[Inert gas|inert]]. Leakage of any of these gases can be hazardous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/chemicals/compressed/compress.html#tphp | title=About Compressed gases}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Store, handle, and use compressed gases ====
*All cylinders whether empty or full must be stored upright.&lt;ref name="compressed gases"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mathesongas.com/pdfs/products/guide-to-safe-handling-of-compressed-gases-publ-03.pdf | title=Store, handle, and use compressed gases}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Secure cylinders of compressed gases. Cylinders should never be dropped or allowed to strike each other with force.&lt;ref name="compressed gases" /&gt;
*Transport compressed gas cylinders with protective caps in place and do not roll or drag the cylinders.&lt;ref name="compressed gases" /&gt;

=== Cryogens and dry ice ===
'''Cryogens''', substances used to produce very low temperatures [below -153&amp;nbsp;°C (-243&amp;nbsp;°F)], such as [[liquid nitrogen]] (LN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) which has a boiling point of -196&amp;nbsp;°C (-321&amp;nbsp;°F), are commonly used in laboratories.&lt;ref name="C &amp; DI"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.drs.illinois.edu/SafetyLibrary/CryogensAndDryIce| title=Safety Library Cryogens And DryIce | accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not a cryogen, solid [[carbon dioxide]] or [[dry ice]] which converts directly to carbon dioxide gas at -78&amp;nbsp;°C (-109&amp;nbsp;°F) is also often used in laboratories. Shipments packed with dry ice, samples preserved with liquid [[nitrogen]], and in some cases, techniques that use cryogenic liquids, such as cryogenic grinding of samples, present potential hazards in the laboratory.&lt;ref name="C &amp; DI" /&gt;

Hand protection is required to guard against the hazard of touching cold surfaces. It is recommended that Cryogen Safety Gloves be used by the worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.airproducts.com/company/Sustainability/environment-health-and-safety/product-safety-safetygrams.aspx|title = Safetygrams|website = www.airproducts.com|access-date = 2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www-group.slac.stanford.edu/esh/eshmanual/pdfs/ESHch36.pdf | title=Stanford University: SLAC Environment, Safety, and Health Manual, Chapter 36 | publisher=Stanford University | accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eye]] protection is required at all times when working with cryogenic fluids. When pouring a cryogen, working with a wide-mouth Dewar flask or around the exhaust of cold boil-off gas, use of a full face shield is recommended.&lt;ref name="ES&amp;H Manual"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lbl.gov/ehs/pub3000/CH29/CH29.html | title=ES&amp;H Manual, Chapter 29: Safe Handling of cryogenic liquids | publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory | accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personal protective equipments ===
{{main|Personal protective equipment}}'''Personal protective equipment''' or PPE are equipments worn to prevent against exposure of hazardous substances.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)|url = http://www.hse.gov.uk/toolbox/ppe.htm|website = www.hse.gov.uk|accessdate = 2015-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, PPE does not eliminate the risks of hazards but it helps protect the user from the exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Laboratory Safety PPE {{!}} Yale Environmental Health and Safety|url = http://ehs.yale.edu/laboratory-safety-ppe|website = ehs.yale.edu|accessdate = 2015-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; To make a workplace safer, it should provide instructions and training of how to use and choose proper PPE in different situations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[[File:Protective nitrile gloves.jpg|thumb|158x158px|Nitrile gloves]]

PPE includes: 
* Long-sleeved shirts, [[lab coat]]s, aprons.&lt;ref name="ES&amp;H Manual" /&gt;
* [[goggle]]s&lt;ref name="ES&amp;H Manual" /&gt;
* Safety [[Medical glove|gloves]];&lt;ref name="ES&amp;H Manual" /&gt;
** There are 2 common types of safety gloves that are widely used in high school or university laboratory,  Latex and Nitrile gloves. Latex gloves have a high sensitivity when it comes to contact and fine control which is very suitable for surgery.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/01-12.pdf|url = http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/01-12.pdf|website = www.nps.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hands, Nitrile gloves are the gloves that do not have latex protein which cost twice. It was known as the most durable, resisted to tear and many chemicals. Beside all the benefits, Nitrile gloves also have drawbacks since it can oxidize silver and high reactive metals as these metals can react with sulfur.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Therefore, wearer should have an extra care while wearing this type of protective gloves.  
* Face shield or safety

=== Electrical ===
In the laboratory, there is the potential for workers to be exposed to electrical hazards including [[electric shock]], electrocutions, fires and [[explosions]]. Damaged electrical cords can lead to possible shocks or electrocutions. A flexible electrical cord may be damaged by door or window edges, by staples and fastenings, by equipment rolling over it, or simply by aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.osha.gov/Publications/laboratory/OSHAquickfacts-lab-safety-electrical-hazards.pdf | title=Electrical Hazards | publisher=OSHA | accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The potential for possible electrocution or electric shock or contact with electrical hazards can result from a number of factors, including the following:
*Faulty electrical equipment/instrumentation or wiring;&lt;ref name="Electrical"&gt;https://www.lanl.gov/safety/electrical/docs/elec_hazard_awareness_study_guide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*Damaged receptacles and connectors;&lt;ref name="Electrical" /&gt; and
*Unsafe work practices.&lt;ref name="Electrical" /&gt;

=== Fire ===
[[File:Segnale incendio.svg|thumb|Fire|154x154px]]
'''[[Fire]]''' is the most common serious hazard that one faces in a typical laboratory. While proper procedures and training can minimize the chances of an accidental fire, laboratory workers should still be prepared to deal with a fire emergency should it occur. In dealing with a laboratory fire, all containers of infectious materials should be placed into autoclaves, incubators, refrigerators, or freezers for containment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://uwaterloo.ca/safety-office/programs-and-procedures/hazard-recognition-control/fire-hazards | title=Fire Hazards control | accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small bench-top fires in laboratory spaces are not uncommon. Large laboratory fires are rare. However, the risk of severe injury or death is significant because fuel load and hazard levels in labs are typically very high. Laboratories, especially those using solvents in any quantity, have the potential for flash fires, explosion, rapid spread of fire, and high toxicity of products of combustion (heat, smoke, and flame)
[[File:Fire blanket.jpeg|thumb|215x215px|Fire blanket]]

===Glassware===
* Broken glass is a hazard for a sharps related injury.
* Correct eye protection should be worn in most experiments involving glassware.
* Inserting a glass rod through a stopper can introduce the possibility of a stab wound or sharps injury if the rod breaks.  The hands must be protected.  
* Tubing should be cut from a barbed connection so as not to shatter the connection.  A quick disconnect is preferable to a barbed fitting.
* Ground glass joints can become a breaking hazard if they freeze.

* Broken and other waste glass should be discarded in a separate container specially marked to indicate its contents.
* Glassware should always be labeled as to its contents.
* Rapid heating (or cooling) may cause uneven [[thermal expansion]] putting too much [[Stress (mechanics)|mechanical stress]] on the surface and cause it to [[fracture]]. Fracturing is a concern when people new to laboratory become impatient and heat glassware, especially the larger pieces, too fast. Heating of glassware should be slowed using an insulating material, such as metal foil or wool, or specialized equipment such as [[heated bath]]s, [[heating mantle]]s or laboratory grade [[hot plate]]s to avoid fracturing.
* Hot glass looks like cold glass, so a person must be careful to avoid grabbing hot glassware.
* Glassware can explode if the exhaust is in any way restricted, so any apparatus should be vented.  
* Glassware can implode under negative pressure
* When connecting joints, it is the responsibility of the person overseeing the experiment to select the correct seal. For example, PTFE tape, bands, and fluoroether-based grease or oils may emit toxic [[perfluoroisobutylene]] fumes if the rated temperature limits are exceed.&lt;ref&gt;Haiduc, I., "Silicone Grease: A Serendipitous Reagent for the Synthesis of Exotic Molecular and Supramolecular Compounds", Organometallics 2004, volume 23, pp. 3-8.  {{DOI|10.1021/om034176w}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Serendipitous Reactions Involving a Silicone Grease|author = Lucian C.

{{main|Ecological footprint}}

This is a '''list of countries by ecological footprint'''. The table is based on data spanning from 1961 to 2013 from the
[[Global Footprint Network]]'s National Footprint Accounts published in 2016. Numbers are given in [[global hectares]] per capita. The
world-average [[ecological footprint]] in 2012 was 2.84 [[global hectares]] per person (22.1 billion in total). With a world-average [[biocapacity]] of 1.73 global hectares (gha) per person (9.2 billion in total), this leads to a global ecological deficit of 1.1 global hectares per person (7.8 billion in total).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For humanity, having a footprint smaller than the planet's biocapacity is a necessary condition for sustainability. After all, ecological overuse is only possible temporarily. A country that consumes more, on average, than 1.73 gha per person has a resource demand that is not replicable world-wide. Vice versa, with a footprint below 1.73 gha per person, is not necessarily sustainable, because the quality of the footprint may still lead to ecological destruction. If a country does not have enough ecological resources within its own territory to cover its population's footprint, then it runs an ecological deficit and the country is termed an ''ecological debtor''. Otherwise, it has an ecological reserve and it is called a ''creditor''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Countries ==

'' This table below is based on 2012 results (National Footprint Accounts edition 2016). The latest edition (2018) is available on Global Footprint Network's website at http://data.footprintnetwork.org. Note that this list contains only 188 countries, covering most of the countries with more than one million inhabitants.''

'''MRC Human Nutrition Research''' is the largest [[research institute]] in the UK for human nutrition, and is based in [[Cambridge]].

==History==
In 1998 MRC Human Nutrition Research (HNR) was formed as a result of the restructuring of the [[Dunn Human Nutrition Unit]] following the resignation of Professor Roger Whitehead.&lt;ref name=HNR&gt;http://www.mrc-hnr.cam.ac.uk&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]] (MRC), founded in 1913, had previously had a Human Nutrition Research Unit at the end of the [[Second World War]]; this was founded and directed by BS Platt, and was interested in serious nutritional deficiencies in children, that would cause significantly premature death. HNR was formed in order to continue to advance the MRC's portfolio of strategic and applied nutrition research.

==Mission==
The mission of HNR is to conduct nutrition research and surveillance to improve the health of the population with a focus on [[obesity]] and metabolic risk, [[musculoskeletal]] health, [[intestinal]] health and [[nutritional]] inequalities.&lt;ref name=HNR/&gt;

==Objectives==
HNR currently states that its 4 objectives&lt;ref name=HNR/&gt; are to: 
*Advance knowledge through discovery science, the development of innovative methodologies and the application of specialist expertise in priority areas
*Improve health and economic advantage through the exchange of knowledge and technology to inform nutrition policy and practice
*Provide opportunities for training and to build capacity for nutrition research
*Foster a dialogue with the public on nutrition science and its implications for health

==Structure==
HNR is [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/644523 based] at Peterhouse Technology Park, in south-east Cambridge, on the [[South Cambridgeshire]]-Cambridge boundary, round the corner from the Fulbourn - Cherry Hinton [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/44579 Tesco] and [[Fulbourn Hospital]]. [[ARM Holdings]] have their [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/609459 headquarters] on the same site.

It is divided into 3 main research departments and a support department:
* Cellular and Molecular Sciences
* Nutritional Physiology &amp; Biomarkers
* Diet and Population Health
* Scientific Operations &amp; Logistics

These departments house research groups concerned with:
* Maternal &amp; Child Nutrition
* National Nutrition Surveys
* Nutrition &amp; Bone Health
* Nutritional Interventions
* Obesity &amp; Related Metabolic Disorders
* Nutrition Communications and Translation into Policy &amp; Practice
* Nutrition Epidemiology
* Biomineral Research
* Lipid Profiling and Signalling
* Physiological Modelling of Metabolic Risk
* Dietary Assessment

HNR also has a library which houses an important collection of historically significant research documents.

==Function==
HNR conducts nutrition research and surveillance to improve the health of the population with a focus on obesity and metabolic risk, musculoskeletal health, intestinal health and nutritional inequalities.

===Research===
In November 1999 HNR scientists discovered that children in the early 1950s, despite [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|food rationing]], had healthier diets than children today. They had a greater intake of calcium, from drinking more milk, and of iron, as they ate more red meat than poultry and iron containing dark green vegetables such as [[broccoli]] and [[kale]]. In the early 1950s, no children would have eaten pasta, but 50% of children in the 1990s did. However children in the 1950s were faced with more incurable illnesses, prevented today by [[Vaccination schedule#United Kingdom|vaccination]].

In September 2002, HNR scientists proved a link between [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|diabetes]] and being overweight. They found that people who had lost 9&amp;nbsp;lb in weight had reduced the chances of having diabetes by 58%.

In 2007, a study was conducted to research the effect of negative weight stigmas on patients. The conclusion was that in several cases, the belief in the negative weight stigmas led to overeating and bad health habits in patients who were studies. More details can be found in the official report listed under references.

HNR participated in the [[National Diet and Nutrition Survey]] and the MRC's [[National Survey of Health and Development]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nshd.mrc.ac.uk NSHD]&lt;/ref&gt; which showed insights such as approximately five per cent of the UK's population are vegetarian.

A '''medical escort''' is a non-emergency medical service provided by commercial aircraft, by medical escort companies, and sometimes by self-employed medical escort freelancers, who typically work for a medical repatriation company. Medical escort is one of three options offered by these medical repatriation companies, they are Air ambulance, Road Ambulance, and Medical escort

Cost effectiveness comes from using Commercial [[aircraft]], first and business class seats. On some occasions an airline [[stretcher]] will be used if the patient is unable to sit up in their seat for landing and take off. Several rows of seating in the back of the plane are removed to allow for a medical [[stretcher]] to allow non-emergency medical transport. Medical escort crews carry with them equipment that enables them to provide appropriate medical treatment to a non emergency patient. Common equipment for Medical escort services includes O², basic [[medication]], monitoring equipment, and [[CPR]] equipment

Some companies provide the full spectrum of medical professionals, including certified [[paramedic]]s, critical care [[nurse]]s, [[Respiratory Therapist]]s and physicians. The medical escort [[physician]]s consult with the referring physicians to jointly determine the most appropriate level of care and most suitable method of transportation.

== Standards ==

===Medical escort Team===

The make up of the medical escort team of a medical escort varies depending on patient condition, country, area, service provider and by type of air medical Services. Commercial airliners are most likely to be used to transport patients, and the crew may consist of [[Emergency Medical Technician]]s, [[Paramedic]]s, [[Flight nursing|flight nurses]], a [[Respiratory Therapist]], and / or a [[physician]]. Those services with a primary focus on non-Emergency care transport are more likely to be staffed by paramedic and or a nurses. In these cases, the crew generally consists of a specially-trained advance care paramedic or nurse.

===Medical Control===

The nature of the air operation will frequently determine the type of medical control required, and in most cases, the available skill set of a typical paramedic. As a result, those operating in this environment will often be permitted to exercise more latitude in medical decision-making. Most systems operate almost entirely off-line, using recognised protocols for almost all procedures and only resorting to on-line medical control when protocols have been exhausted. Some Medical escort operations have full-time, on-site medical coordinators with relevant backgrounds

===Equipment and Interiors===
Many types of  commercial aircraft can be used for medical escort purposes, aircraft are equipped with basic life support equipment and advanced life support Drugs in addition to all equipment and medications take by the team. Many escort teams can carry portable oxygen concentrators for patients that require it. Certain airlines can also accommodate commercial stretcher service where several seat rows in economy are removed and a commercial stretcher is fitted in place.

The challenge in most air medical escort operations, are the effects of reduced atmospheric pressure on some patients, the requirement to divert the aircraft to land quickly in the event of an unexpected emergency,  fellow passengers, the amount of working space, both of which may create  issues for the provision of ongoing care. While in flight the entire patient will be physically accessible. Although some companies have adapted many techniques and procedures to minimize the effect on other passengers and the overall safety and well-being of the patients flying on commercial flights.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8800">'''Medical practice management software''' ('''PMS''') is a category of [[healthcare software]] that deals with the day-to-day operations of a [[medical practice]] including [[veterinarian]]s. Such software frequently allows users to capture patient demographics, [[Calendaring software|schedule]] appointments, maintain lists of insurance payors, perform [[medical billing|billing]] tasks, and generate reports.

In the [[United States]], most PMS systems are designed for small to medium-sized medical offices. Some of the software is designed for or used by third-party medical billing companies.  PMS is often divided among desktop-only software, client-server software, or Internet-based software.  

The desktop-only variety is intended to be used only on one computer by one or a handful of users sharing access.  Client-server software typically necessitates that the practice acquire or lease server equipment and operate the server software on that hardware, while individual users' workstations contain client software that accesses the server.  Client-server software's advantage is in allowing multiple users to share the data and the workload; a major disadvantage is the cost of running the server.  Internet-based software is a relatively newer breed of PMS. Such software decreases the need for the practice to run their own server and worry about security and reliability.  However, such software removes patient data from the practice's premises, which can be seen as a security risk of its own.

PMS is often connected to [[electronic medical records]] (EMR) systems. While some information in a PMS and an EMR overlaps &amp;mdash; for example, patient and provider data &amp;mdash; in general the EMR system is used for the assisting the practice with clinical matters, while PMS is used for administrative and financial matters. Medical practices often hire different vendors to provide the EMR and PMS systems. The integration of the EMR and PMS software is considered one of the most challenging aspects of the medical practice management software implementation.

==Components of practice management software==

Most practice management software contains systems that allow users to enter and track patients, schedule and track patient appointments, send out insurance claims and patient statements as part of the collection process, process insurance, patient and third party payments, and generate reports for the administrative and clinical staff of the practice.  Typically, using a PMS also involves keeping up to date large sets of data including lists of diagnosis and procedures, lists of insurance companies, referring physicians, providers, facilities, and much more.

===Appointment scheduling===
Practice Management systems often include a calendaring or scheduling component that allows staff to create and track upcoming patient visits. Software is often differentiated by whether it allows double-booking, or whether it uses a scheduling or a booking model.  Schedules are often color-coded to allow healthcare providers (i.e. doctors, nurses, assistants) to easily identify blocks of time or sets of patients.

===Claims and statements===

If the patient carried a valid private or public insurance policy at the time these services were provided, the charges are then sent out as an insurance claim.  The process of sending charges may happen on paper, usually with the use of the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|CMS]]-1500 form.  This form lists the provider who performed the service, the patient, the services performed and the related diagnoses.  For institutional (typically hospital) charges, claims may also be sent out on the UB-04 forms (formerly the UB-92 which use of was discontinued in 2007). Claims may also be sent out electronically using industry-standard electronic data interchange standards. 

In most cases, electronic claims are submitted using an automated software process. Some practice management system vendors will update CPT/ICD-10 codes in the practice software on an annual basis. Some, especially smaller firms, leave it entirely up to medical practices.&lt;ref&gt;Terry, Ken [http://www.physicianspractice.com/index/fuseaction/articles.details/articleID/1264.htm "Coding Software Upgrades"] Physicians Practice journal, volume 19, number 1, year 2009, access date July 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; While a lot of insurance payers have created methods for direct submission of electronic claims, many software vendors or practice users use the services of an electronic claim clearinghouse to submit their claims.  Such clearinghouses commonly maintain connections to a large number of payers, and make it easy for practices to submit claims to any of these payers.  Instead of creating a connection to every payer, the practice user or software vendor must only connect to the clearinghouse.

Once a claim is adjudicated by the payer, some sort of a response is sent to the submitter.  This usually comes as a paper [[Explanation of Benefits]] (EOB) or an Electronic Remittance Advice (ERA).  These describe the actions that the payer took on each claim: amounts paid, denied, adjusted, etc.

In cases where a patient did not have proper insurance, or where insurance coverage did not fully pay the charges, the practice will usually send out patient statements.  Practice management software often contains a way for a practice to print and mail their own statements (or other correspondence), and may even contain a way to interface to third-party patient statement printing companies.

===Reporting===

Almost invariably, the process of running a medical practice requires some introspection, and practice management software usually contains reporting capabilities to allow users to extract detailed data on financial performance and patient financial histories.  PMS often has both pre-setup reports as well as allow users to design their own, ad-hoc reports.
In some cases, the reporting functionality of PMS interfaces with [[Decision support system]]s or has similar functionality built-in.

==Practice management software and commerce==
The global veterinary PMS industry size was estimated to be 323 million&lt;ref name=Grandview&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/veterinary-software-market|title=Veterinary Software Market Size &amp; Share {{!}} Industry Report, 2014-2025|website=www.grandviewresearch.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2016 with more than 120 million from United States.&lt;ref name=Grandview/&gt; Veterinary PMS is expected to be growing at the rate of 8.9% per year.&lt;ref name=Grandview/&gt; There are more than 20 different software available in the market for Veterinary PMS.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.capterra.com/veterinary-software/|title=Best Veterinary Software {{!}} 2018 Reviews of the Most Popular Systems|website=www.capterra.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practice management software (PMS) has traditionally been commercial; few viable free practice management systems exist, though a few [[Open-source software|open source]] systems are under development.  PMS usually costs about $100 to tens of thousands of dollars to license and operate.{{Citation needed|reason=need examples to substantiate preceding figures|date=March 2014}}

PMS often needs to interface with the outside world.  There are a number of standards that are used:

* [[Health Level 7|HL7]] &amp;mdash; used to communicate with hospitals, or EMR systems
* [[ANSI X12]] EDI transactions, including:
** 270 &amp;mdash; eligibility &amp; benefit inquiry - Is the patient an insured of this payer?
** 271 &amp;mdash; eligibility &amp; benefit response (response to 270) - A yes or no response that the patient is insured.
** 276 &amp;mdash; claims status inquiry (follows 837 submission)
** 277 &amp;mdash; claim status response (response to 276)
** 835 &amp;mdash; claim payment/advice (follows 837) - 837 medical claim is paid, and amount of payment and the patient's financial responsibility
** 837D &amp;mdash; claim submission for dental claims
** 837I &amp;mdash; claim submission for institutional claims
** 837P &amp;mdash; claim submission for professional claims

'''Mental disorders diagnosed in childhood''' are divided into two categories: childhood disorders and learning disorders. These disorders are usually first diagnosed in infancy, childhood, or adolescence, as laid out in the [[DSM IV TR|DSM-IV-TR]]&lt;ref name="dsm"&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2000). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th ed., text rev.). Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[ICD-10]].  The DSM-IV-TR includes ten subcategories of disorders including [[mental retardation]], Learning Disorders, Motor Skills Disorders, Communication Disorders, Pervasive Developmental Disorders, Attention-Deficit and Disruptive Behavior Disorders, Feeding and Eating Disorders, Tic Disorders, Elimination Disorders, and Other Disorders of Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence.

==Intellectual disability==

===DSM-IV-TR===
* 317 Mild mental retardation
* 318.0 Moderate mental retardation
* 318.1 Severe mental retardation
* 318.2 Profound mental retardation
* 319 Mental retardation, severity unspecified
Mental retardation is coded on Axis II of the DSM-IV-TR.  The diagnostic criteria necessary in order to diagnose intellectual disability consists of:
:A. Functioning that is significantly below average with an IQ of about 70 or lower.  If diagnosing an infant, the clinician would take notice of intellectual functioning that is below average.
:B. Multiple consecutive failures to meet standards set that are appropriate for one's age or cultural expectations.  These deficits could be in at least two of the following areas: taking care of oneself, social skills, health, academic skills, communication, living at home, ability to self-direct, use of community resources, work, free time, and safety. 
:C. The presence of these symptoms must be detectable before age 18.
There are varying degrees of intellectual disability, which are identified by an IQ test.
:'''Mild mental retardation:''' IQ level 50–55 to approximately 70
:'''Moderate mental retardation:''' IQ level 35–40 to 50–55
:'''Severe mental retardation:''' IQ level 20–25 to 35–40
:'''Profound mental retardation:''' IQ level below 20 or 25
'''Mental retardation, Severity Unspecified:''' This unspecified diagnosis is given when there is a strong assumption that the child is mentally retarded, but cannot be tested because the individual is too impaired, not willing to take the IQ test or is an infant.

===Cause===
Intellectual disability in children can be caused by genetic or environmental factors.  The individual could have a natural brain malformation or pre or postnatal damage done to the brain caused by drowning or a traumatic brain injury, for example.  Nearly 30 to 50% of individuals with intellectual disability will never know the cause of their diagnosis even after thorough investigation.

Prenatal causes of intellectual disability include:
* Congenital infections such as cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, herpes, syphilis, rubella and human immunodeficiency virus
* Prolonged maternal fever in the first trimester
* Exposure to anticonvulsants or alcohol
* Untreated maternal phenylketonuria (PKU)
* Complications of prematurity, especially in extremely low-birth-weight infants
* Postnatal exposure to lead&lt;ref&gt;Am Fam Physician. 2000 Feb 15;61(4):1059–67, 1070.&lt;/ref&gt;
Single-gene disorders that result in intellectual disability include:
* [[Fragile X syndrome]]
* [[Neurofibromatosis]]
* [[Tuberous sclerosis]]
* [[Noonan's syndrome]]
* [[Cornelia de Lange syndrome|Cornelia de Lange's syndrome]]
These single-gene disorders are usually associated with atypical physical characteristics. 
About 1/4 of individuals with intellectual disability have a detectable chromosomal abnormality.  Others may have small amounts of deletion or duplication of chromosomes, which may go unnoticed and therefore, undetermined.

===Symptoms===
As an infant, the individual with intellectual disability might sit up, crawl, or walk later than what is developmentally appropriate. They may have trouble talking or learn to talk late.  The infants with intellectual disability will probably have trouble learning to potty train, feeding themselves, remembering things, with problem-solving, and may have recurrent explosive tantrums. 
Some symptoms that a child with intellectual disability might show are continued infant-like behavior, a lack of curiosity, the inability to meet educational demands, learning ability that is below average, and the failure to meet developmentally appropriate intellectual goals.  Some children with severe intellectual disability may have seizures, mobility problems, vision problem, or hearing problems.

===Treatment===
There is no treatment for intellectual disability but there are plenty of services offered for those diagnosed to help them function in their everyday lives.  Professionals will sometimes work out an Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP), which documents the child's needs, as well as the services that would best help them specifically.  Speech, physical, and occupational therapy may be offered.  Intellectually disabled children can be placed in special education classes through the public school system, where the school and parents will map out an Individualized Education Program (IEP).  This program lays out all of the services and classes the child will become involved in during their time in school.

==Learning disorders==

===DSM-IV-TR===
* 315.00 [[Reading disability|Reading disorder]]
* 315.1 [[Mathematics disorder]]
* 315.2 [[Disorder of written expression]]
* 315.9 Learning disorder NOS: This category contains disorders in learning that do not meet the criteria for any specific learning disorder. This category is a catch-all for an individual that has problems in one, two or all areas of learning, and they can be diagnosed with learning disorder NOS even if their performance scores are not considerably below average for their age, age appropriate education, and measured intelligence.  The individual would need to experience a significant interference in which the cause is their learning skills on their academic achievements in order to be diagnosed with learning disorder NOS.

===Cause===
Learning disorders are believed to be caused by a nervous system abnormality.  The abnormality could either be in the structure of the brain or in the functioning of chemicals in the brain. Because of this, individual has problems receiving, processing or communicating information normally. Some causes of the nervous system abnormality include problems during pregnancy, birth or early infancy, brain trauma at a young age, exposure to toxins, and prematurity.&lt;ref&gt;"Learning Disorders". ''Boston Children's Hospital''. 26 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symptoms===
Children with a learning disorder may display the following traits:
* Have trouble reading aloud
* Have trouble spelling, expressing themselves in writing, or in learning the alphabet
* Have trouble following directions
* May have trouble comprehending what they read
* Have trouble remembering how to pronounce written words
* May have trouble organizing their thoughts to produce what they want to say
* May misinterpret or confuse math symbols or numbers
* May not be able to retell a story in order
* May have trouble beginning or figuring out the next step of a task&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicinenet.com/learning_disability/page2.htm#what_are_the_signs_of_a_learning_disability "Learning Disabilities Symptoms". ''MedicineNet.com''. April 16, 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment===
There is no specific treatment for children with learning disorders, but there are special programs and services offered to help them cope with their disorder. Children are taught new ways to interpret and understand information. Often, children with learning disorders can remain in their class, but may be pulled away to focus on trying to enhance their learning skills.  Speech and language therapy is offered to those with learning disorders. Tutors are often beneficial.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Motor skills disorders==
===DSM-IV-TR===
* 315.4 [[Developmental coordination disorder]]

===Cause===
The cause behind motor skills disorders is not exact, but the cause is usually genetic or environmental.  Motor skills disorders are often associated with physiological or developmental abnormalities including ADHD, learning disorders, developmental disabilities and prematurity.&lt;ref&gt;Perlstein, David. "Motor Skills Disorder." ''e medicine health'' WebMD. 25 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symptoms===
In infants, some babies may be hypotonia, a loose and floppy baby, or hypertonia, a stiff and rigid baby.  Toddlers may have trouble feeding themselves or may stand, sit or walk later than what is developmentally normal.  Other signs of motor skills disorders may be children that are clumsy or have excessive accidents, such as knocking things over.  Children who have trouble with complex physical activities such as dancing, swimming, catching or throwing a ball, or drawing may avoid these activities completely.&lt;ref&gt;Perlstein, David. "Motor Skills Disorder Symptoms." ''eMedicine Health.'' April 15, 2013, from http://www.emedicinehealth.com/motor_skills_disorder/page3_em.htm#motor_skills_disorder_symptoms&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment===
Different therapies are offered to children with motor skills disorders to help them improve their motor effectiveness.  Many children work with an occupational and physical therapist, as well as educational professionals.  This helpful combination is beneficial to the child.  Cognitive therapy, sensory integration therapy, and kinesthetic training are often favorable treatment for the child.

==Communication disorders==

===DSM-IV-TR===
* 315.31 [[Expressive language disorder]]
* 315.32 [[Mixed receptive-expressive language disorder]]
* 315.39 [[Phonological disorder]]
* 307.0 [[Stuttering]]
* 307.9 [[Communication disorder]] NOS

===Cause===
The cause of communication disorders in children are usually biological, developmental or environmental.  These causes include abnormalities in brain development, exposure to certain toxins during pregnancy, or genetic factors.&lt;ref&gt;Communication Disorders. ''Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC.'' 27 Mar. 2013. {{cite web |url=http://www.chp.edu/CHP/P02559 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130626174721/http://www.chp.edu/CHP/P02559 |archivedate=2013-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symptoms===
Some children with communication disorders may not speak or may have a very limited vocabulary for their developmental period.  Children with communication disorders may have trouble following directions or naming simple objects.  During childhood, he or she may have trouble comprehending or forming sentences.  As they get older, the child may have more trouble expressing or understanding abstract ideas.

===Treatment===
Speech and language therapists are often very reliable for helping children with communication disorders.  Remedial techniques are often used to help the child communicate more and work on their existing problems.  Another technique is to help push the child to work on their strengths to improve their communication skills.&lt;ref&gt;"Communication Disorders." ''Psychology Today.'' April 18, 2013, from http://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/communication-disorders&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pervasive developmental disorders==

===DSM-IV-TR===
* 299.00 [[Autistic disorder]]
* 299.80 [[Rett's disorder]]
* 299.10 [[Childhood disintegrative disorder]]
* 299.80 [[Asperger's disorder]]
* 299.80 [[Pervasive developmental disorder]] NOS

===Cause===
Pervasive developmental disorders have no known cause yet, but researchers are interested in finding a connection between the disorders and problems in the nervous system.  Studies are being done on the brain and spinal cord in children with PDDs to try to find a link.

===Symptoms===
Children with pervasive developmental disorders may exhibit the following symptoms:
* Have trouble expressing or understanding ideas
* Have trouble understanding nonverbal communication
* Difficulty in social interactions
* Temper tantrums
* Aggressive behavior
* May play differently with toys than other children
* May have difficulty adjusting to new places or people
* Anxious behavior&lt;ref&gt;"Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDDs) Symptoms." ''MedicineNet.com.'' April 17, 2013, from
http://www.medicinenet.com/pervasive_development_disorders/article.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment===
A specific treatment plan is usually laid out for the child because of the wide range of behaviors and abilities in each child.  Treatment often involves promoting better communication and socializing, and reducing behaviors that can be disruptive.  Children with pervasive developmental disorders may be placed in special education classes, receive behavior modification training, speech, physical or occupational therapy, or medication.

==Attention-deficit and disruptive behavior disorders==

===DSM-IV-TR===
* '''[[Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder]]'''
** 314.01 Combined subtype: If both Criteria A1 and A2 are met for the past 6 months.
** 314.01 [[ADHD predominantly hyperactive-impulsive|Predominantly hyperactive-impulsive subtype]]
** 314.00 [[ADHD predominantly hyperactive-impulsive|Predominantly inattentive subtype]]
** 314.9 Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder NOS: This category is used for individuals that have pronounced symptoms of inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity, yet do not meet the criteria for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.  These individuals may include:
::1. Individuals who meet the criteria for ADHD, Predominantly Inattentive Type, but their age of onset is later than 7 years old.
::2. Individuals who present inattentive symptoms and meet the full criteria for the disorder but also have a behavioral pattern that is defined by having low energy, daydreaming, and laziness.
* '''[[Conduct disorder]]'''
** 312.81 Childhood onset: At least one of the Diagnostic Criteria needs to be met for Conduct Disorder before age 10.
** 312.82 Adolescent onset: The absence of any criteria characteristic of Conduct Disorder before the age of 10.
** 312.89 Unspecified onset: The age of onset is unknown.
** 313.81 [[Oppositional Defiant Disorder]]
** 312.9 Disruptive Behavior Disorder NOS: This category includes disorders similar to conduct or oppositional defiant behaviors but do not meet the diagnostic criteria for either disorder, yet the impairment is clinically significant and causes significant impairment in the individual's life.

===Cause===
With ADHD being one of the most common disorders diagnosed in childhood, the causes are often studied, yet still inconclusive.  Many researchers say ADHD is caused by genetic factors, yet other studies are being done to expand on the cause. One research study showed that children who carry a certain gene associated with ADHD had a thinner layer of tissue in the areas of the brain associated with attention.  As the children grew older, the brain tissue thickened and their ADHD symptoms improved.  Environmental factors, such as the mother smoking or drinking during pregnancy is connected to children with ADHD.  Children exposed to lead at a young age will also have an increased chance of developing ADHD.  Brain injuries could cause ADHD, yet only a small number of children diagnosed fit into this category.  Researchers have looked into sugar intake as the cause of ADHD, but have found little to support that theory.&lt;ref&gt;2008. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). ''National Institute of Mental Health.'' 27 Mar. 2013. http://www.nimh.nih.gov/index.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symptoms===
Children with attention deficit and disruptive behavior disorders may show the following symptoms:
* Impulsivity or distractibility
* Difficulty socializing
* Aggressive behavior
* Difficulty following rules or directions or completing a task
* Problems at school
* Frustration
* Alcohol or drug use&lt;ref&gt;"Attention Deficit and Disruptive Behavior Disorders."''Right Diagnosis from Healthy Grades.'' April 15, 2013, from http://www.rightdiagnosis.com/a/attention_deficit_and_disruptive_behavior_disorders/intro.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment===
Medication is often used to treat children with attention-deficit and disruptive behavior disorders. Individualized programs are available for children with these disorders in order to help them function in and complete school.  It is the common belief that many of these disorders will disappear as the children get older, but recent research shows that it can carry on into adulthood.

==Feeding and eating disorders of infancy or early childhood==

===DSM-IV-TR===
* 307.52 [[Pica (disorder)|Pica]]
* 307.53 [[Rumination disorder]]
* 307.59 Feeding disorder of infancy or early childhood: Diagnosed if met by the following criteria:
::A. Feeding problems that are established due to continued failure to eat adequately that causes  significant weight gain or significant weight loss over a period of at least one month.
::B. The disturbance is not related to a gastrointestinal abnormality or any other general medical condition.
::C. The disturbance is not the cause of another mental disorder or by the lack of available food.
::D. The symptoms must be present before age 6.

===Cause===
There are a number of factors that could potentially contribute to the development of feeding and eating disorders of infancy or early childhood. These factors include:
* Physiological – a chemical imbalance effecting the child's appetite could cause a feeding or eating disorder.
* Developmental – developmental abnormalities in oral-sensory, oral-motor, and swallowing can impact the child's eating ability and elicit a feeding or eating disorder.
* Environmental – simple issues such as inconsistent meal times can cause a feeding or eating disorder. Giving the child food that they are not developmentally acquired for can also cause these disorders. Family dysfunction and sociocultural issues could also play a role in feeding or eating disorders.
* Relational – when the child is not securely attached to the mother, it can cause feeding interactions to become disturbed or unnatural. Other factors, such as parental emotional unavailability and parental eating disorders, can cause feeding and eating disorders in their children.
* Psychological and behavioral – these factors include one involving the child's temperament. Characteristics such as being anxious, impulsive, distracted, or strong-willed personality types are ones that could affect the child's eating and cause a disorder. The individual could have learned to reject food due to a traumatic experience such as choking or being force fed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.primarypsychiatry.com/aspx/articledetail.aspx?articleid=1256 Winters, N. C. "Feeding Problems in Infancy and Early Childhood". ''Primary Psychiatry''. 30 March 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symptoms===
Physical and emotional changes are often the most indicative symptoms of feeding and eating disorders of infancy or early childhood.  The child's growth and development may be delayed due to the lack of necessary nutrients.  The child will usually weigh much less than other children.  Withdrawal and irritability are often associated with children that are malnourished.&lt;ref&gt;"Feeding and Eating Disorders of Infancy or Early Childhood." ''GoMentor.com.'' April 16, 2013, from http://www.gomentor.com/articles/feeding-and-eating-disorders-of-infancy-or-early-childhood.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment===
Since feeding and eating disorders in children can cause dangerous risks to the child, it is important to seek treatment as soon as possible.  Cognitive behavioral therapy can be incredibly beneficial to children with feeding or eating disorders.  Family therapy is usually encouraged in order to keep all members involved in nourishing the child.

==Tic disorders==

===DSM-IV-TR===
*307.23 [[Tourette syndrome|Tourette's disorder]]
*307.22 Chronic motor or vocal [[tic disorder]]
*307.21 Transient tic disorder: Must meet the following criteria in order to be diagnosed:
:::A. Either one or multiple motor and/or vocal tics, for example, motor or vocal noises that are rapid, repeated, sudden, and nonrhythmic.
:::B. The tics happen multiple times over the course of the day, almost every day for at least 4 weeks, but do not occur continually for any longer than 1 year.
:::C. Symptoms are present before the age of 18.
:::D. The tics are not a result of any effects due to drug use, or any other medical condition, for example, Huntington's disease.
:::E. The individual does not have symptoms that meet the criteria for Tourette's Disorder or Chronic Motor or Vocal Tic Disorder.
*307.20 Tic disorder NOS: This category is for disorders characterized by tics but do not meet the diagnostic criteria of the DSM-IV-TR.

===Cause===
No definitive cause of tic disorders has been declared, but for the most part, the cause lies within biological, chemical, or environmental factors. Studies have shown that abnormal neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and serotonin, which are active in chemical messages in the brain, can serve as a cause of tic disorders.  Researchers have also found abnormal changes in certain parts of the brain that cause strain on the blood flow within the brain, which is likely a contributor of tic disorders.  75% of tic disorders have a genetic component.  It appears that tic disorders can be caused or worsened by recreational or prescription drug use.  Tics can form simply if a person repeats sounds or words they hear over the course of a normal day.&lt;ref&gt;Tic Disorders. ''Encyclopedia of Mental Disorders.'' 28 Mar. 2013. http://www.minddisorders.com/Py-Z/Tic-disorders.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symptoms===
Children with a tic disorder may exhibit the following symptoms:
* Overwhelming urge to make movement
* Jerking of arms
* Clenching of fists
* Excessive eye blinking
* Shrugging of shoulders
* Kicking
* Raising eyebrows
* Flaring of nostrils
* Production of repetitive noises such as grunting, clicking, moaning, snorting, squealing, or throat clearing

===Treatment===
As part of the treatment, family members and friends are advised not to call attention to the tics when the child is performing them.  If they do, the child may develop more tics more frequently.  Behavioral therapy and medication are often the choices of treatment for tic disorders in children.&lt;ref&gt;"Tic Disorders Treatment." ''Encyclopedia of Mental Disorders.'' April 16, 2013, from http://www.minddisorders.com/Py-Z/Tic-disorders.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elimination disorders==

===DSM-IV-TR===
* 307.6 [[Enuresis]] (not due to a general medical condition)
* 307.7 [[Encopresis]], without constipation and overflow incontinence
* 787.6 [[Encopresis]], with constipation and overflow incontinence

===Cause===
Encopresis: The most common cause of encopresis is constipation.  When a child becomes constipated, feces build up in and stretch the rectum.  This stretching causes the nerve endings to become dull.  The child may not feel when they need to eliminate the feces or if the waste is coming out.  Inside the rectum, the feces could become too large or solid to eliminate without feeling pain.  While the mass of feces is stuck in the child's rectum, liquid feces could leak from around the mass and out of the child's body.  The main causes of constipation are diet, lack of sufficient amounts of water, stress, not enough exercise, and inconsistent bathroom routines.&lt;ref&gt;"Elimination Disorders and Encopresis in Children." ''MedicineNet.com.'' 4 Jun 2012. Web. 2 Apr 2013. http://www.medicinenet.com/encopresis/article.htm#what_causes_encopresis&lt;/ref&gt;

Enuresis: The cause of enuresis is thought to be unclear and usually is attributed to many factors.

** Genetic – there is a genetic component within enuresis and it tends to run in families.
** Inability to feel that the bladder is full and be aroused from sleep.
** Insufficient size of bladder – the child's bladder is too small to contain the amount of urine produced.
** Psychological factors – these are not main factors that contribute to enuresis, but stress may be a cause.
** Maturational delay – the child's recognition that the bladder is full and they need to go to the bathroom is a developmental issue.  Many children with enuresis will develop this skill as they grow older.&lt;ref&gt;"Enuresis." ''Clinical Key.'' Web. 2 Apr 2013. {{cite web |url=https://www.clinicalkey.com/topics/urology/enuresis.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130628214759/https://www.clinicalkey.com/topics/urology/enuresis.html |archivedate=2013-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symptoms===
The majority of children with enuresis show no other symptoms besides wetting the bed at night.  If other symptoms are present, such as blood stains in their underwear or unusual pain,  the child is likely to have a more serious medical problem.  Children with encopresis are likely to exhibit symptoms such as; loss of appetite, loose or watery stools, abdominal pain, scratching or itching of anal area because of irritation, withdrawal from friends, or secretive attitude associated with bowel movements.&lt;ref&gt;"Elimination Disorders and Encopresis in Children." ''WebMD.'' April 15, 2013, from http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/elimination-disorders-encopresis&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment===
Children usually "grow out" of their elimination disorders by the time they reach their teens.  If treatment is necessary, the most effective choice for enuresis is behavior modification, which involves a special pad that the child sleeps on at night.  If the pad gets wet, an alarm goes off and the child is directed to go to the bathroom.  Stool softeners or laxatives are the choice of treatment for encopresis.

==Other disorders of infancy, childhood, or adolescence==

===DSM-IV-TR===
* 309.21 [[Separation anxiety disorder]]
* 313.23 [[Selective mutism]]
* 313.89 [[Reactive attachment disorder]] of infancy or early childhood
* 307.3 [[Stereotypic movement disorder]]
* 313.9 Disorder of infancy, childhood, or adolescence NOS: This category is a residual category for disorders with onset in infancy, childhood, or adolescence that do not meet criteria for any specific disorder in the classification.

===Cause===
There are multiple factors that contribute to the cause of other disorders of infancy, childhood, or adolescence.  The majority of the factors are going to be physical or environmental.  Some of the disorders could be caused by parental influence, such as their inability to properly take care of their child.  Most of the other disorders diagnosed in infancy, childhood, or adolescence involve anxiety.  If the child is continually put in anxiety producing situations, they could show symptoms of these disorders.  Usually, the symptoms will be mild and the child will not get help, which may cause the symptoms to become worse.&lt;ref&gt;Toia, Rafael. "Other Disorders of Infancy, Childhood or Adolescence." ''GoMentor.com.'' Web. 3 Apr. 2013. http://www.gomentor.com/articles/other-disorders-infancy-childhood-adolescence.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symptoms===
Separation anxiety disorder
* Excessive stress when separated from home or family
* Fear of being alone
* Refusal to sleep alone
* Clinginess
* Excessive worry about safety and getting lost
* Frequent medical complaints with no cause
* Refusal to go to school

Selective mutism
* Unable to speak in certain social situations, even though they are comfortable speaking at home or with friends
* Difficulty maintaining eye contact
* May have blank facial expressions
* Stiff body movements
* May have a worrisome personality
* May be incredibly sensitive to sound
* Difficulty with verbal and nonverbal expression
* May appear shy, when in reality, they have a fear of people.

Reactive attachment disorder of infancy or early childhood
* Withdrawing from others
* Aggressive attitude towards peers
* Awkwardness or discomfort
* Watching others but not engaging in social interaction

Stereotypic movement disorder
* Head banging
* Nail biting
* Hitting or biting oneself
* Hand waving or shaking
* Rocking back and forth

===Treatment===
*Separation anxiety disorder
Cognitive behavioral therapy is often used to treat separation anxiety disorder.  Family therapy may also be helpful to get to the core of the issue.  Systemic desensitization techniques are usually used to help the child get used to being comfortable away from home.
*Selective mutism
It is important not to "enable" the child with selective mutism by allowing them to remain silent in the social settings that they are uncomfortable in.  Both parents and teachers need to be involved in the treatment of selective mutism.  The most important factor to remember is that the child does not have a speech disorder; it is an anxiety disorder.
*Reactive attachment disorder of infancy or early childhood

Treatment almost always involves the child and their parents or caregivers parents may need to take parenting skills classes and attend family therapy with the child.  Individual therapy with the child and therapist is effective. Another technique is keeping close physical contact between the child and their parents.
*Stereotypic movement disorder
Behavioral techniques and psychotherapy are the most effective treatment for children with this disorder.  It is important to change the child's environment so that they are unable to harm themselves.  Medication is also effective.

== Perception ==
=== Stigma ===

It is not uncommon for children with mental health disorders to be faced with stigma. Stigma against those with mental health disorders can be seen through stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Corrigan, Watson |title=Understanding the impact of stigma on people with mental illness |journal=World Psychiatry: Official Journal of the World Psychiatric Association (WPA) |date=2002 |page=16-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This stigma can come from the public (those without the disorder) and by oneself (those with the disorder).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Corrigan, Watson |title=Understanding the impact of stigma on people with mental illness |journal=World Psychiatry: Official Journal of the World Psychiatric Association |date=2002 |page=16-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both public and self-stigma can diminish the self-esteem of those with mental health disorders; especially children.

Typically, children with mental health disorders are first exposed to stigma within their family unit before later being exposed to it in the school setting and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hinshaw |first1=S |title=The stigmatization of mental i llness in children and parents: Developmental issues, family concerns, and research needs |journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry |date=2005 |page=714-724 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While some may view stigma as a minor problem when looking at the other obstacles children with mental illness may face, others view it as a major problem because of the negative impact it can have on a child's treatment and self perception.

Stigma within the family can cause a delay in the diagnosis of mental health disorders, delaying treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hinshaw |first1=S |title=The stigmatization of mental illness in children and parents: Developmental issues, family concerns, and research needs |journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry |date=2005 |page=714-734 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also cause children to be hesitant in seeking treatment, even when they are experiencing clear mental health symptoms. This is especially true for boys who are more likely than girls to avoid seeking out treatment because of the fear of experiencing stigma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chandra, Minkovitz |title=Stigma starts early: Gender differences in teen willingness to use mental health services |journal=Journal of Adolescent Health |date=2006 |page=754.e1-754.e8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
There are people such as [[Thomas Szasz]] and [[Peter Breggin]] who say child psychiatry should be made illegal because behaviours are not diseases. They believe psychiatric drugging is a form of child abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=mrjGBgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA217&amp;ots=rGOw6r1mLg&amp;dq=szasz%20Giving%20a%20child%20a%20psychiatric%20drug%20is%20poisoning%2C&amp;pg=PA217#v=onepage&amp;q=szasz%20Giving%20a%20child%20a%20psychiatric%20drug%20is%20poisoning,&amp;f=false Day of wrath By César Tort.] {{ISBN|9781291884449}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=K99wCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT232&amp;ots=Rl2zFBzGAm&amp;dq=Giving%20a%20child%20a%20psychiatric%20drug%20is%20poisoning%2C&amp;pg=PT232#v=onepage&amp;q=Giving%20a%20child%20a%20psychiatric%20drug%20is%20poisoning,&amp;f=false Deadly Psychiatry and Organised Denial By Peter C.

The quality of living survey is conducted to help governments and major companies place employees on international assignments. The survey also identifies those cities with the highest [[personal safety]] ranking based upon internal stability, crime, effectiveness of law enforcement and relationships with other countries. In this case, [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]] is top, followed by [[Bern]], [[Helsinki]] and [[Zürich]], all equally placed at number 2.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Scoring==
The 231 cities are evaluated on 39 factors including political, [[economic]], [[Social environment|environmental]], personal safety, [[health]], [[education]], [[transport]]ation and other [[Public services|public service]] factors.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} In 2010, cities were compared to [[New York City]] which was given a base score of 100.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12377">'''Multiple sex partners''' ('''MSP''') is the measure and incidence of engaging in [[sexual activities]] with two or more people within a specific time period. Sexual activity with MSP can happen simultaneously or serially. MSP includes sexual activity between people of a different [[gender]] or the same gender. MSP can also mean that one person may have a long-term relationship or relationships, and when the second relationship begins, the person can be said to have multiple sex partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Promiscuous&amp;nbsp;— definition of promiscuous by the Free Online dictionary|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/promiscuous|publisher=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another term, ''[[polyamoruous]]'', is a behavior and not a measure describing multiple romantically sexually or romantically committed relationships at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sheff | first = Elisabeth | title = When Someone You Love Is Polyamorous: Understanding Poly People and Relationships | publisher = Thorntree Press | location = Portland, Oregon | year = 2016 | url = https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0996460195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young people having MSP in the last year is an indicator used by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) to evaluate [[risky sexual behavior]] in [[adolescent]]s and  monitoring changes in the worldwide HIV/AIDS infection rates and deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Tsala Dimbuene, Z., Emina, J., &amp; Sankoh, O. (2014). UNAIDS ‘multiple sexual partners’ core indicator: promoting sexual networks to reduce potential biases.Global Health Action, 7. doi:https://dx.doi.org/10.3402/gha.v7.23103  http://www.globalhealthaction.net/index.php/gha/article/view/23103#Abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions and quantification==
Epidemiologists and clinicians who quantify risks associated with MSP do so to identify those who have had sexual intercourse with more than one partner in the past 12 months. For the purposes of the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO)'s effort to eliminate [[HIV]] infection, quantifying measures progress in reducing the percentage of those with [[AIDS]]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has described their rationale by assuming that the spread of HIV in most locales depends upon the number of  MSP. Those who have MSP possess a higher risk of HIV transmission than individuals that do not have multiple sex partners.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt;

WHO uses indicators, such as MSP, age, mortality, morbidity, geographical location and signs and [[symptom]]s of disease. This is done so that change can be measured and so that the effect of indicators can be assessed.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt;

Following the initial quantification of the number of MSP, the respondent is again surveyed three and then five years later. In addition to the survey, respondents' sexual histories are obtained. Analysis assists those conducting the study to verify and help define the term MSP.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt;

For the indicator MSP, WHO has defined a summary of what it measures, rationale for the indicator, numerator, denominator and calculation, recommended measurement tools,  measurement, frequency, and the strengths and weaknesses of the indicator.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt;

WHO's definition of MSP has some strengths and weaknesses The quantification is an indicator and a picture of the levels of higher-risk sex in a locale. If those surveyed changed their activity to one sexual partner, the change will be quantified by changes in the indicator. This disadvantage is that though a respondent may reduce the number of MSP in a 12 month period, the indicator will not reflect this change in sexual activity. Even so, decreasing the number of MSP may not indicate a change. Potentially this definition and quantification may have a significant impact on the pandemic of HIV and used as a measure of program success. WHO recommends that additional indicators that quantify MSP more precisely to capture the reduction in multiple sexual partners in general.&lt;ref name=WHO2015&gt;{{cite book|publisher=World Health Organization and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)|title=Global AIDS Response Progress Reporting 2015|date=2015|isbn=9789241509343|page=33|access-date= 12 January 2016  |url=http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/JC2702_GARPR2015guidelines_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Sexually transmitted infections at record high |publisher= The Brown and White  (university newsletter) | url = http://thebrownandwhite.com/2016/12/04/sti-record-high/# | accessdate = 2016-12-20 |first= Amber |last= Cardona |date= 2016-12-04  }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the CDC’s Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, having multiple sex partners has been quantified to mean that   those greater than or equal to age 25 had four or more sexual partners in one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Schools Teaching Prevention | publisher = National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date = 9 December 2015| url = https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/2015/nhpc-press-release-schools-teaching-prevention.html | accessdate = 2017-02-19  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other examples==
Epidemiologists in Tanzania used the indicator MSP in their study of AIDS incidence among 15-19-year-olds by documenting the respondent as being sexually active and having MSP in the last 12 months.&lt;ref name="ExaveryLutambi2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Exavery|first1=Amon|last2=Lutambi|first2=Angelina M|last3=Mubyazi|first3=Godfrey M|last4=Kweka|first4=Khadija|last5=Mbaruku|first5=Godfrey|last6=Masanja|first6=Honorati|title=Multiple sexual partners and condom use among 10 - 19 year-olds in four districts in Tanzania: What do we learn?|journal=BMC Public Health|volume=11|issue=1|year=2011|pages=490|issn=1471-2458|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-11-490|pmid=21696581|pmc=3141458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social history (medicine)==

A complete medical history includes an assessment of the number sexual partners with which a person has had within a certain time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Data from Tufts University Provide New Insights into Medical Students (Assessment of Medical Student and Resident/Fellow Knowledge, Comfort, and Training With Sexual History Taking in LGBTQ Patients) | publisher = Health &amp; Medicine Week| date= 2015-06-12 | accessdate = 2016-01-11 | url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA416887528&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=upitt_main&amp;it=r&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=1122a69cd4aa9d732c76b3670b01432a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A social history (abbreviated "SocHx") that part of a medical exam addressing familial, occupational, and recreational aspects of the patient's personal life that have the potential to be clinically important.&lt;ref name = cdc2015/&gt; MSP is only the description of the behavior described in clinical terms. Promiscuity can mean that a moral judgement is made because some parts of societies promote sexual activity to occur only within exclusive, single-partner, committed relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK’s most promiscuous city in ‘one night stand’ poll  revealed|url=http://metro.co.uk/2014/01/08/liverpool-named-uks-most-promiscuous-city-in-one-night-stand-poll-4254176/|website=Metro.co.uk|publisher=Associated Newspapers Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; is often the way researchers define a society's promiscuity levels at any given time.  MSP increases the risk of many diseases and other conditions.

The CDC in the past has quantified  MSP for adolescents with the following descriptions:
*Never having had sexual intercourse (no MSP)
*Having multiple sex partners, defined as having had four or more sex partners during one's lifetime
*Sexual activity was defined as having had sexual intercourse during the past 3 months&lt;ref&gt;

Some clinicians define MSP by also taking into account concurrent sexual relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 11% of Men Have Multiple Sex Partners | publisher=WebMD | url = http://www.webmd.com/sex-relationships/news/20071031/11-percent-of-men-have-multiple-sex-partners
| accessdate = 2016-01-12  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The likelihood of developing substance abuse or dependence increases linearly with the number of sex partners, an effect more pronounced for women. People who have a higher number of sex partners do not have higher rates of anxiety or depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Lingering Psychological Effects of Multiple Sex Partners |publisher= Psychology Today |last=Krauss  |first=Susan  |date = 20 April 2013 | url = https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201304/the-lingering-psychological-effects-multiple-sex-partners | accessdate = 2016-01-11  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Teachman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Teachman|first1=Jay|title=Premarital Sex, Premarital Cohabitation, and the Risk of Subsequent Marital Dissolution Among Women|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|volume=65|issue=2|year=2003|pages=444–455|issn=0022-2445|doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2003.00444.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health risks==

MSP increases the risk of developing bacterial vaginosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = STD Facts&amp;nbsp;— Bacterial Vaginosis |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention| url = https://www.cdc.gov/STD/bv/STDFact-Bacterial-Vaginosis.htm | accessdate = 2016-01-11  }}&lt;/ref&gt; MSP can result in pregnant women with a greater risk of contracting HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|title= Special Populations, 2010 STD Treatment Guidelines | url = https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/specialpops.htm | accessdate = 2016-01-11  }}&lt;/ref&gt; HIV is strongly associated with having MSP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Michael C

Prevention of disease strategies include intensive counseling of those who have met the definition of multiple sex partners.&lt;ref name = cdc2015&gt;{{cite web | title = Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, 2015 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6403a1.htm?s_cid=rr6403a1_w# | accessdate = 2017-02-20  }}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jamaica one of the primary contributing associations to the AIDS/HIV epidemic is the risky behavior of having multiple sex partners. A 2004 Behavioral Surveillance Survey demonstrated that 89 percent of males and 78 percent of females aged 15 to 24 had sex with a nonmarital or noncohabitating partner in the preceding 12 months. Fifty-six percent of males and 16 percent of females had multiple sex partners in the preceding 12 months.&lt;ref name=usaid&gt;[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/lac/jamaica_profile.pdf "Health Profile: Jamaica"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913115359/http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/lac/jamaica_profile.pdf |date=2008-09-13 }}. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (June 2008). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sub-sahara Africa, travel and wealth is a risk factor in engaging in sexual activities with multiple sex partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Household Wealth, Travel Associated with Having Multiple Partners among Sub-Saharan African Men - International Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health | publisher=HighBeam Research | url = https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-239918277.html | accessdate = 2017-01-09  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="648">'''Nutritional epidemiology''' is a relatively new field of [[medical research]] that studies the relationship between [[nutrition]] and health. Diet and physical activity are difficult to measure accurately, which may partly explain why [[nutrition]] has received less attention than other [[risk factors]] for disease in [[epidemiology]].

=== Repetitive motion injuries ===
{{main|Repetitive strain injury}}
Efficiently dealing or running table games often require workers to perform the same motion over and over for many hours.&lt;ref name="hoffmannworkcomp.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hoffmannworkcomp.com/workplace-injuries-suffered-by-casino-workers-st-louis-work-injury-lawyer/|title=Workplace Injuries Suffered by Casino Workers - St. Louis Work Injury Lawyer|date=2017-06-15|work=St. Louis Workers Compensation &amp; Work Injury Lawyer - Law Office of James M. Hoffmann|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The repeated lifting and reaching needed to successfully run table games may lead to musculoskeletal injury (MSI).&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Considering workplace ergonomics can not only keep the employees safe, but can also keep the patrons comfortable, which will keep them at the tables longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.casinojournal.com/articles/90315-erogonimcal-casino-furniture?|title=Erogonimcal casino furniture|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To prevent slip and falls, casino employers should establish well marked walking routes with changes in height marked by a visual signal.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hoffmannworkcomp.com/slips-trips-and-falls-can-cause-costly-workplace-injuries/|title=Slips, Trips, and Falls Can Cause Costly Workplace Injuries|date=2016-09-29|work=St. Louis Workers Compensation &amp; Work Injury Lawyer - Law Office of James M.

=== Shift work ===
{{main|Shift work}} 
Those who work the night shift are known to be at increased risk of insomnia, general morbidity, and all cause mortality.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;  Studies of casino shift workers have found increased emotional and behavioral problems in their children as well as six time higher rate of divorce in men with children who have been married less than 5 years.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Presser|first=Harriet B.|date=February 2000|title=Nonstandard Work Schedules and Marital Instability|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2000.00093.x|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|language=en|volume=62|issue=1|pages=93–110|doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2000.00093.x|issn=0022-2445}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Women with children were also three times more likely to get divorced while performing shift work at casinos.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;  However, there was no increased rate of divorce in couples without children who performed shift work at casinos.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;   Employers should try to minimize this risk by keeping each worker on a consistent shift, rather than rotating them between days and nights.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;  If shift rotation must occur, it is better to rotate employees forward from day into evening shifts.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;

=== Slips, trips and falls ===
According to the United States Bureau of Labor and Statistics, slip, trips, and falls were the leading cause of days away from work (DAFW) in 2017 causing 20,000 workers to miss one or more days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/osh_11082018.htm|title=Employer-Reported Workplace Injuries and Illnesses (Annual) News Release|website=bls.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While only 1 in 6 slips and falls will result in missed days of work, those who do miss work are often absent for a lengthy period (11 days on average).&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Burns ===
In casinos, these most commonly occur in preparation or delivery of foods, beverages, or oils since liquid or steam at only 155° Fahrenheit can burn or scald the skin.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  These burns can often be avoided with special precautions taken when cleaning deep fryers or pressure cookers.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  If possible full containers of liquids should not be carried as they can spill, especially on slippery or cluttered floors.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Assault and battery ===
Emotions can run high during gambling and this combined with alcohol which is often provided for free while playing can lead patrons to become aggressive and agitated toward the staff or other players.&lt;ref name="hoffmannworkcomp.com" /&gt;  Casinos also frequently have large amounts of money present increasing the possibility of a robbery that can put an employee in a dangerous situation.&lt;ref name="hoffmannworkcomp.com" /&gt;  Since there may be blood after a fight,  employees should be trained how to take appropriate measures to protect against blood born pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oshageneralindustry.com/the-osha-general-industry-casino-rules-and-regulations/|title=The OSHA General Industry Casino Rules and Regulations – OSHA General Industry|website=oshageneralindustry.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Work stress ===
Casino workers have had panic attacks at work when the casino is understaffed.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.uci.edu/academics/real-life-learning/clinics/pdfs/Banking-on-Unsafe-Working-Conditions-05-17-16.pdf|title=Banking on Unsafe Working Conditions Placing Profits Before Protection of Casino &amp; Hotel Workers’ Human Rights in Deutsche Bank's U.S. Supply Chain|last=Marouf|first=Fatma|date=May 17, 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gambling addictions ===
{{main|Problem gambling}}
Casino employees are known to be at higher risk for gambling problems than the average person.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;  Employers should offer education as a preventative strategy as well as treatment for employees who become addicted.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;  Casino managers can protect their employees and patrons by tracking and excluding gambling addicts as well as limiting the amount one can lose in any 24 hour period.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;

=== Alcoholism ===
{{main|Alcoholism}}
Casino employees are known to be at higher risk for alcohol problems than the average person.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;  Employers should offer education as a preventative strategy as well as treatment for employees who become addicted to alcohol.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;

=== Depression ===
{{main|Depression (mood)}}
Casino employees are known to be at higher risk for depression than the average person.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;  Employers should offer education as a preventative strategy as well as treatment for employees who develop depression.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;

Casinos can protect their employees from high levels of ambient noise by locating their performing entertainment and slot machines in a separate physical location.&lt;ref name=":102"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kialidster.weebly.com/uploads/2/6/3/6/26364996/worksite_evaluation_-_casino_table_games_dealer.pdf|title=SPPH 565 Worksite Evaluation Casino Table Games Dealers|last=Lidster|first=Kia|date=November 29, 2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; NIOSH has conducted one noise evaluation of a casino in 2003, but did not find any evidence that noise in that casino was loud enough to put employees at risk of hearing loss.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/nioshtic-2/20025662.html|title=NIOSHTIC-2  Publications Search - 20025662 - Health hazard evaluation report: HETA-2003-0157-2934, Spirit Mountain Casino, Grand Ronde, Oregon.|website=cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a preventative measure going forward, NIOSH recommended that noise levels be reevaluate whenever a new piece of equipment is installed or whenever employees express concerns about the noise level.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  NIOSH generally recommends that such noise assessments be conducted on the busiest nights of the week or whenever the noise is likely to be loudest as that is the time of greatest risk to workers and patrons.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  The [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists|ACGIH]] 8 hour [[Threshold limit value|Threshold Limit Value]] (TLV) for sound is 85 A-weighted [[decibel]] (dBA).&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt;  Exposure at or below this level of sound is expected to protect most workers from noise induced hearing loss over a 40 year career.&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; Noise induced hearing loss typically begins in the higher frequencies of 4 or 6&amp;nbsp;kHz and the progresses to the  0.5, 1, 2, and 3&amp;nbsp;kHz which are the frequencies of most conversations.&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists|ACGIH's]] exposure limits are recommendations based on the most current science, though OSHA's standard still allows employers to expose workers to a maximum [[Permissible exposure limit|permissible exposure level]] (PEL) of 90 dBA for 8 hours each day under 29 CFR 1910.95.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  OSHA also a 5 dBA exchange allowing this to increase to 100 dBA for 4 hours of work or decrease to 85 dBA when working a 16 hour shift.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  Casino workers were generally found to be exposed to an 8-hr TWAs noise level of 76.4-81.8 dBA.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  Another key takeaway of the noise evaluation of the casino was that the highest noise detected was in the children's arcade with levels reaching 78 – 84 dBA.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Cancer ===
{{main|Cancer}}

=== Metal dust from coin counting ===
In 2000, NIOSH was asked to evaluate a casino for metal dust after employees reported eye, nose, and airway irritation that they thought might be related to the process used to count metal coins.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/hhe/reports/pdfs/2001-0109-2835.pdf|title=Health Hazard Evaluation Report 20010109 Lac Vieux Desert Resort and Casino Watersmeet, Michigan|last=Kiefer|first=Max|date=March 2001|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NIOSH evaluated the air and employees for nickel, copper, and zinc because these metals make up the vast majority of modern US coins.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  All levels were below the NIOSH [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL), specifically nickel was 7 μg/m3 (REL 15 μg/m3), copper was 24 μg/m3 (REL 1,000 μg/m3), and zinc was below the limit of detection (REL 5,000 μg/m3).&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

== Best practices to prevent harm ==

=== Card dealers ===
Musculoskeletal injury (MSI) is a common way dealers can be injured performing their routine duties.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Ergonomics tries to prevent these injuries by "fitting the job to the worker."&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  This involves educating workers about how best to safely perform their job and prevent injury as much as it does providing them with any special or protective equipment.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  The human body is less vulnerable to injury when in a neutral posture.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Beware that your risks of overuse injury increase when there are fewer players at the table as the variation in your body motions decrease.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Stretching frequently or shifting your position during breaks in the game will decrease static posture.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; It is worth noting that dealing different card games poses different risks: for example black jack dealers deal more cards per shift than baccarat dealers.&lt;ref name=":103"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kialidster.weebly.com/uploads/2/6/3/6/26364996/worksite_evaluation_-_casino_table_games_dealer.pdf|title=SPPH 565 Worksite Evaluation Casino Table Games Dealers|last=Lidster|first=Kia|date=November 29, 2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, a safety determination for one game does not assure a similar safety profile in other similar games.&lt;ref name=":103" /&gt;  Rotation of dealers between different tables allows workers to engage different muscle groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/diseases/rmirsi.html|title=(none)|last=Safety|first=Government of Canada, Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and|website=ccohs.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common postures that put dealers at risk are listed below along with how best to minimize the risk of harm:[[File:Card_Dealing_Ergonomics.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Card_Dealing_Ergonomics.jpg|thumb|This image shows proper wrist position when dealing cards.  Dealers should keep their wrist straight and deal cards by moving only the middle and index fingers.]]

==== Dealing cards ====
Minimize bending your wrist by flicking the cards forward using your index and middle fingers.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Keep your wrists straight (do not flex or bend them). Turn to face your players or use your peripheral vision, rather than turning your head which can strain your neck.&lt;ref name=":103" /&gt;

==== Retrieving cards from the shoe ====
The cards and shoe should be at or just below elbow height and adjusted so that you can keep your elbows close to your body and do not have to move your elbows out to the side to deal or shuffle.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Position the shoe so that you can use it comfortably with players in your line of sight without twisting your back, wrists, or hands.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Alternatively, a shoe below the table allows the dealer to rest their hands on a flat surface.&lt;ref name=":103" /&gt;  Keeping your joints in as straight a line as possible will decrease overuse injuries.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;
[[File:Standing_Dealing_Collecting_Cards_Ergonomics.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Standing_Dealing_Collecting_Cards_Ergonomics.jpg|thumb|This picture illustrates how to reduce back strain by using a footrest under the table while dealing or reaching to collect cards after a hand is finished.]]

==== Reaching forward to collect cards or bets while standing ====
Your waist should be even with the height of the table.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; An adjustable height step box for dealers is more appropriate than an adjustable height table, which could put patrons at risk of an awkward posture.&lt;ref name=":103" /&gt;  Alternatively, patrons could be provided with chairs that adjust in height.&lt;ref name=":103" /&gt;  If possible, use a step/footrest under the table to allow you to lean forward onto the elevated leg as you reach forward.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  A step/footrest also allows you to change your posture regularly to avoid becoming static.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  If cards are beyond your reach, ask players to slide them toward you.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Standing tends to decrease static posture and relieve joint pain throughout the body.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worksafebc.com/en/resources/health-safety/books-guides/ergonomic-tips-for-the-hospitality-industry/preventing-injuries-to-casino-card-dealers?lang=en&amp;origin=s&amp;returnurl=https://www.worksafebc.com/en/search#q=casino&amp;sort=relevancy&amp;f:language-facet=%5BEnglish%5D|title=WorkSafeBC|website=worksafebc.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, standing also increases pressure on your feet.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Therefore, it is a good idea for employers to allow employees to wear supportive footwear.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

==== Reaching forward to collect cards or bets while seated ====
Adjust the chair such that it supports your lower back and your feet are supported with your knees flexed to 90 degrees.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Use a chair that swivels to turn and face the player with whom you are interacting.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;[[File:Seated_Dealing_Cards_Ergonomics.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Seated_Dealing_Cards_Ergonomics.jpg|thumb|This picture shows a seated dealer. Note that the head is in a neutral position with the viewing distance 18-24 inches (depending on the person's focal length) and comfortable viewing angle. The dealer's feet are flat on the floor with knees and hips at approximately 90 degrees. This table is too high, which is why the dealer's hands are not resting on it. If they were, then the edge of the table should be padded to provide support to the dealer. Alternatively, the dealer's seat could be raised and a footrest should be used if the dealers feed to not comfortably reach the floor.]]&lt;br /&gt;

=== Croupier ===
Make sure commonly used items are within comfortable reach.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; When handing out or retrieving bets move along the length of the table so that you don't have to twist or reach.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Using your arm to start the wheel spinning and use a "snap" technique to spin the ball in the opposite direction, rather than your wrist.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

=== Bellhops and luggage handlers ===
If work involves lifting or moving objects, then employees should be trained in safe manual handling procedures.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worksafebc.com/en/resources/health-safety/books-guides/ergonomic-tips-for-the-hospitality-industry/preventing-injuries-when-handling-luggage?lang=en&amp;origin=s&amp;returnurl=https://www.worksafebc.com/en/search#q=Preventing%2520injuries%2520when%2520handling%2520luggage&amp;sort=relevancy&amp;f:language-facet=%5BEnglish%5D|title=WorkSafeBC|website=worksafebc.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Be careful to avoid awkward postures when loading or unloading luggage by having your feet facing the luggage and firmly planted on the ground.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;  It is important to shorten the distance between you and the luggage by pulling it toward you or moving toward it because the further the weight is from your body, the more strain you put on your back.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Although you may not feel pain while performing the movement, you can still put your joints at risk by lifting luggage awkwardly, especially if it is heavy.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;     Use a luggage cart whenever the luggage does not have wheels or when moving more than 2 bags.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;  When loading a luggage cart, attempt to store larger bags upright and on the bottom and medium bags at waist height and on top.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;  As often as possible, avoid loading any bags higher than your shoulders as our ability to lift safely decreases substantially at this height.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;  Loading the cart in this manner will also allow you to push, rather than pull the cart and will keep your field of vision clear.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;  Pushing will protect your back and upper extremity from injury.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;  Remember to use both hands touching the cart slightly below elbow level and generate power to push from your legs.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;   If your luggage cart is not functioning properly due to misaligned or malfunctioning wheels, request it be serviced because a malfunctioning cart can lead to awkward forces being applied to your body.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

=== Housekeepers and room attendants ===
It is important to make sure that you can see where you are going.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worksafebc.com/en/resources/health-safety/books-guides/ergonomic-tips-for-the-hospitality-industry/preventing-injuries-to-room-attendants?lang=en&amp;origin=s&amp;returnurl=https://www.worksafebc.com/en/search#q=Preventing%2520injuries%2520to%2520Room%2520attendants&amp;sort=relevancy&amp;f:language-facet=%5BEnglish%5D|title=WorkSafeBC|website=worksafebc.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Push your service cart with both hands just below shoulder level, rather than pulling it behind you.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;  If your cart is not functioning properly due to misaligned or malfunctioning wheels, request it be serviced because a malfunctioning cart can lead to awkward forces being applied to your body.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;  Use both arms to vary and lessen the load on either arm when doing tasks such as scrubbing, folding, vacuuming, and making beds.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;  Employers should allow employees to wear comfortable shoes to reduce strain on their back and knees.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;  If your work requires you to kneel, cushion your knees with a mat, towel, or knee pads.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;  Maintain a straight back when making a bed by dropping to one knee to tuck in sheets, rather than bending your back.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;  When changing duvets or pillows, turn the covers inside out to change them, rather than stuffing them back inside.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;  This will reduce the force applied to your arm.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;   Use a tool with a long handle or a step stool to clean hard or awkward to reach places like bathtubs and mirrors that extend above your head.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;  When cleaning the shower or tub, stand inside to make it easier to reach.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;  To avoid falling, never stand on the toilet or edge of the tub as it can be slippery.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Housekeepers are often expected to clean biological material (blood, vomit, excrement) and if so, workers should receive proper training and protective equipment.&lt;ref name=":132"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.uci.edu/academics/real-life-learning/clinics/pdfs/Banking-on-Unsafe-Working-Conditions-05-17-16.pdf|title=Banking on Unsafe Working Conditions Placing Profits Before Protection of Casino &amp; Hotel Workers’ Human Rights in Deutsche Bank's U.S. Supply Chain|last=Marouf|first=Fatma|date=May 17, 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Housekeepers need to be alert to possible abuse by guests and casino managers need to have a plan in place to keep workers safe from guests.&lt;ref name=":132" /&gt;

=== Front desk staff ===
If standing for a prolonged period of time use anti-fatigue matting under your feet to provide cushioning or stand with one foot elevated to shift your weight periodically from side to side (see illustration above for card dealers).&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worksafebc.com/en/resources/health-safety/books-guides/ergonomic-tips-for-the-hospitality-industry/preventing-injuries-to-front-desk-agents?lang=en&amp;origin=s&amp;returnurl=https://www.worksafebc.com/en/search#q=Preventing%2520injuries%2520to%2520Front%2520desk%2520agents&amp;sort=relevancy&amp;f:language-facet=%5BEnglish%5D|title=WorkSafeBC|website=worksafebc.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Employers should allow employees to wear comfortable shoes that provide them with enough cushioning.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;  If you are too short to comfortably see and reach over the desk, ask for a platform to stand on or an adjustable chair with a footrest that your legs can reach.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;  Make sure that frequently used items are within easy reach and in your line of sight that avoids twisting you back or rotating your neck.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;  The telephone and computer require continuous attention to this recommendation.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;  A goal is to have your computer monitor at or just below eye level and your keyboard just below or even with elbow height.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;  Do not hold the phone by pinching the telephone between your ear and shoulder, but rather hold it or ask for a lightweight headset to prevent developing neck pain.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

=== Hosts, servers and attendants ===
[[File:Serving_Ergonomics.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Serving_Ergonomics.jpg|thumb|This photo emphasizes proper wrist position for servers to avoid musculoskeletal injury.&amp;nbsp; The first pictures shows the serving tray resting on both the hand and forearm to share the weight.&amp;nbsp; The elbow is bent to 90 degrees and the tray is kept close to the body.&amp;nbsp; The second picture shows the wrist flexed awkwardly which can cause injury and the tray above the shoulder which increases the height to which it must be lifted.&amp;nbsp; The final picture shows the tray resting on the fingertips which decreases the surface carrying the load and can strain the smaller muscles of the hand. &amp;nbsp;]]Move toward the customer or around the table if possible to refill drinks or remove plates so as to avoid straining to reach.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worksafebc.com/en/resources/health-safety/books-guides/ergonomic-tips-for-the-hospitality-industry/preventing-injuries-to-servers?lang=en|title=WorkSafeBC|website=worksafebc.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  You are at higher risk when the pitcher or plate are full as they are heavier and your arm is outstretched moving the weight away from your body.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;  Employers should allow employees to wear comfortable shoes to reduce strain on their back and knees which can lead to injury over time.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;  Trays should be carried with the arm in a neutral position, which is typically with your elbow bent to 90° and the palm of your hand facing upward as close to the body as possible.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;  To bring the weight of the tray closer to your body carry the weight on both your forearm and hand, rather than just your hand alone.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;  Avoid awkward positions that can strain your body such as carrying the tray on your finger tips or above your shoulder.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;  To avoid awkward positions or straining muscles unnecessarily, place heavy items close to the center of the tray or closer to your body such that they are over your forearm.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

A 2016 study by NIOSH found that the [[mining]] sector had the highest prevalence of hearing impairment at 17%, followed by the [[construction]] sector (16%) and the [[manufacturing]] sector (14%).

[[Personal protective equipment]], administrative controls, and engineering controls can all work to reduce exposure to noise and chemicals, either by providing the worker with protection such as [[earplug]]s, or by reducing the [[noise]] or chemicals at the source or limiting the time or level of exposure.

== Background ==
OHL is defined as any type of hearing loss, i.e. [[Sensorineural hearing loss|sensorineural]], [[Conductive hearing loss|conductive]], or mixed hearing loss, that occurs due to hazardous characteristics of a work environment.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim KS | title = Occupational hearing loss in Korea | language = English | journal = Journal of Korean Medical Science | volume = 25 | issue = Suppl | pages = S62-9 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21258593 | doi = 10.3346/jkms.2010.25.s.s62 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hearing loss can range in severity from mild to profound.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Hazards of a [[Workplace|work environment]] that can result in OHL include excessive noise, ototoxic chemicals, or physical trauma.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; OHL caused by excessive exposure to noise is also known as [[noise-induced hearing loss]] (NIHL). Noise exposure combined with ototoxic chemical exposure can results in more damage to hearing. OHL caused by physical trauma may include foreign bodies in the ear, vibration, [[barotrauma]], or [[head injury]]. OHL, as well as hearing loss in general, can cause negative secondary social and emotional effects that can impact quality of life.&lt;ref name="pmid14570962"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dalton DS, Cruickshanks KJ, Klein BE, Klein R, Wiley TL, Nondahl DM | title = The impact of hearing loss on quality of life in older adults | journal = The Gerontologist | volume = 43 | issue = 5 | pages = 661–8 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 14570962 | doi = 10.1093/geront/43.5.661 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12918624"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arlinger S | title = Negative consequences of uncorrected hearing loss--a review | journal = International Journal of Audiology | volume = 42 Suppl 2 | issue = | pages = 2S17–20 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12918624 | doi = | url = https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stig_Arlinger/publication/10612964_Negative_consequences_of_uncorrected_hearing_loss_-_A_review/links/0912f502caf00a31ce000000/Negative-consequences-of-uncorrected-hearing-loss-A-review.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the [[United States|United States of America]], approximately 10 million people have NIHL. Over twice that number (~22 million) are occupationally exposed to dangerous noise levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/default.html|title=Noise and Hearing Loss Prevention|last=NIOSH|first=|date=Mar 22, 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Jul 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hearing loss accounted for a sizable percentage of occupational illness in 2007, at 14% of cases.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/stats.html|title=CDC - Facts and Statistics: Noise - NIOSH Workplace Safety &amp; Health|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  United States government agencies such as [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]], [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]] and [[Mine Safety and Health Administration|MSHA]]  are working to understand the causes of OHL and how it can be prevented while providing regulations and guidelines to help protect the hearing of workers in all occupations.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Causes ==

=== Noise exposure ===
Exposure to noise can cause [[vibration]]s able to cause permanent damage to the ear. Both the volume of the noise and the duration of exposure can influence the likelihood of damage. Sound is measured in units called [[decibel]]s, which is a [[Logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] scale of sound levels that corresponds to the level of loudness that an individual's ear would perceive. Because it is a logarithmic scale, even small incremental increases in decibels correlate to large increases in loudness, and an increase in the risk of hearing loss.

Sounds above 80&amp;nbsp;dB have the potential to cause permanent hearing loss. The intensity of sound is considered too great and hazardous if someone must yell in order to be heard. [[Ringing in the ears]] upon leaving work is also indicative of noise that is at a dangerous level. Farming, machinery work, and construction are some of the many occupations that put workers at risk of hearing loss.

[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]] establishes recommended exposure limits (RELs) to protect workers against the health effects of exposure to hazardous substances and agents encountered in the workplace. These NIOSH limits are based on the best available science and practices.  NIOSH established the REL for occupational noise exposures to be 85 decibels, A-weighted (dB[A]) as an 8-hour time-weighted average.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/98-126/pdfs/98-126.pdf|title=Criteria for a Recommended Standard - Occupational Noise Exposure|last=NIOSH|first=|date=1998|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Jul 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occupational noise exposure at or above this level are considered hazardous. The REL is based on exposures at work 5 days per week and assumes that the individual spends the other 16 hours in the day, as well as weekends, in quieter conditions. NIOSH also specifies a maximum allowable daily noise dose, expressed in percentages. For example, a person continuously exposed to 85&amp;nbsp;dB(A) over an 8-hour work shift will reach 100% of their daily noise dose. This dose limit uses a 3-dB time-intensity tradeoff commonly referred to as the exchange rate or equal-energy rule: for every 3-dB increase in noise level, the allowable exposure time is reduced by half.  For example, if the exposure level increases to 88&amp;nbsp;dB(A), workers should only be exposed for four hours.  Alternatively, for every 3-dB decrease in noise level, the allowable exposure time is doubled, as shown in the table below.

OSHA's current [[permissible exposure limit]] (PEL) for workers is an average of 90&amp;nbsp;dB over an 8-hour work day. Unlike NIOSH, OSHA uses a 5-dB exchange rate, where an increase in 5-dB for a sound corresponds to the amount of time workers may be exposed to that particular source of sound being halved. For example, workers cannot be exposed to a sound level of 95&amp;nbsp;dB for more than 4 hours per day, or to sounds at 100&amp;nbsp;dB for more than 2 hours per day. Employers who expose workers to 85&amp;nbsp;dB or more for 8 hour shifts are required to provide hearing exams and protection, monitor noise levels, and provide training.

[[File:NIOSHSoundLevelMeter.jpg|alt=NIOSH Sound Level Meter app using iPhone 7 and external microphone|thumb|The NIOSH Sound Level Meter app]]
[[Sound level meter]]s and [[Noise dosimeter|dosimeters]] are two types of devices that are used to measure sound levels in the workplace. Dosimeters are typically worn by the employee to measure their own personal sound exposure. Other sound level meters can be used to double check dosimeter measurements, or used when dosimeters cannot be worn by the employees. They can also be used to evaluate engineering controls aimed at reducing noise levels.

Some recent studies suggest that some smartphone applications may be able to measure noise as precisely as a Type 2 SLM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kardous CA, Shaw PB | title = Evaluation of smartphone sound measurement applications | journal = The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 135 | issue = 4 | pages = EL186-92 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 25236152 | pmc = 4659422 | doi = 10.1121/1.4865269 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid27794313"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kardous CA, Shaw PB | title = Evaluation of smartphone sound measurement applications (apps) using external microphones-A follow-up study | journal = The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 140 | issue = 4 | pages = EL327 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27794313 | pmc = 5102154 | doi = 10.1121/1.4964639 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most smartphone sound measurement apps are not accurate enough to be used for legally required measurements, the [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/app.html NIOSH Sound Level Meter app] met the requirements of IEC 61672/ANSI S1.4 Sound Level Meter Standards (Electroacoustics - Sound Level Meters - Part 3: Periodic Tests).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Celestina|first=Metod|last2=Hrovat|first2=Jan|last3=Kardous|first3=Chucri A. | name-list-format = vanc |date=October 2018|title=Smartphone-based sound level measurement apps: Evaluation of compliance with international sound level meter standards|journal=Applied Acoustics|volume=139|pages=119–128|doi=10.1016/j.apacoust.2018.04.011|issn=0003-682X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ototoxic chemical exposure ===
Chemically-induced hearing loss (CIHL) is a potential result of occupational exposures. Certain chemical compounds may have [[Ototoxicity|ototoxic]] effects.[https://synergist.aiha.org/201811-the-ear-poisons] Exposure to [[organic solvents]], [[Heavy Metals|heavy metals]], and [[Asphyxiant gas|asphyxiants]] such as [[carbon monoxide]] can all cause hearing loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://osha.europa.eu/en/tools-and-publications/publications/literature_reviews/combined-exposure-to-noise-and-ototoxic-substances|title=Combined exposure to noise and ototoxic substances|last=EU-OSHA|first=European Agency for Safety and Health at Work|date=2009|website=Combined exposure to noise and ototoxic substances|publisher=EU OSHA|access-date=May 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/ohl/default.html|title = CDC - NIOSH Topic: Occupational Hearing Loss (OHL) Surveillance|website = www.cdc.gov|access-date = 2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; These chemicals can be inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. Damage can occur to either the inner ear or the auditory nerve.Certain medications may also have the potential to cause hearing loss.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.commerce.wa.gov.au/worksafe/ototoxic-chemicals-chemicals-result-hearing-loss|title = Ototoxic chemicals - chemicals that result in hearing loss|website = Department of Commerce Western Australia|access-date = 2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both noise and chemical exposures are common in many industries, and can both contribute to hearing loss simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Campo P, Morata TC, Hong O | title = Chemical exposure and hearing loss | journal = Disease-A-Month | volume = 59 | issue = 4 | pages = 119–38 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23507352 | pmc = 4693596 | doi = 10.1016/j.disamonth.2013.01.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Damage may be more likely or more severe if both are present, in particular if noise is impulsive.&lt;ref name="pmid29604694"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fuente A, Qiu W, Zhang M, Xie H, Kardous CA, Campo P, Morata TC | title = Use of the kurtosis statistic in an evaluation of the effects of noise and solvent exposures on the hearing thresholds of workers: An exploratory study | journal = The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 143 | issue = 3 | pages = 1704 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29604694 | doi = 10.1121/1.5028368 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Venet T, Campo P, Thomas A, Cour C, Rieger B, Cosnier F | title = The tonotopicity of styrene-induced hearing loss depends on the associated noise spectrum | journal = Neurotoxicology and Teratology | volume = 48 | pages = 56–63 | pmid = 25689156 | doi = 10.1016/j.ntt.2015.02.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Industries in which combinations of exposures may exist include construction, fiberglass, metal manufacturing, and many more.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is estimated that over 22 million workers are exposed to dangerous noise levels, and 10 million are exposed to solvents that could potentially cause hearing loss every year, with an unknown number exposed to other ototoxic chemicals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A 2018 informational bulletin by the US [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) and the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) introduces the issue, provides examples of ototoxic chemicals, lists the industries and occupations at risk and provides prevention information.[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2018-124/pdfs/2018-124.pdf]

== Prevention ==
OHL is preventable, but currently the interventions to prevent NIHL are complex. A 2017 [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane]] review&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tikka C, Verbeek JH, Kateman E, Morata TC, Dreschler WA, Ferrite S | title = Interventions to prevent occupational noise-induced hearing loss | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = CD006396 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28685503 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006396.pub4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that hearing loss prevention programs revealed that stricter legislation might reduce noise levels. [[Hearing protection devices]], such as [[earmuffs]] and [[earplug]]s can reduce noise exposure to safe levels, but, instructions are needed on how to put plugs into the ears correctly to achieve potential attenuation. Giving workers information on their noise exposure levels by itself was not shown to decrease noise. Engineering solutions might lead to similar noise reduction as that provided by hearing protection. Better evaluation of the noise exposures resulting from engineering interventions is needed, as most of the available information is limited to observations in laboratory conditions. Overall, the effects of hearing loss prevention programs are unclear. Better use of hearing protection as part of a program but does not necessarily protect against hearing loss. The review concluded that in order to prevent NIHL in the workplace the quality of the implementation of prevention programs affects results, and that better quality of studies, especially in the field of engineering controls, and better implementation of legislation are needed. While the 2017 systematic review concluded there is a lack of conclusive evidence it highlighted that this should not be interpreted as evidence of lack of effectiveness. The implications is that further research could affect conclusions reached.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Hierarchy of controls ===
{{Main|Hierarchy of hazard control}}
[[File:NIOSH Hierarchy of Controls.png|alt=NIOSH Hierarchy of Controls showing elimination as most effective, followed by substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls, and then as lease effective are personal protective equipment|thumb|350x350px|NIOSH Hierarchy of Controls]]
The [[Hierarchy of hazard control|hierarchy of controls]] provides a visual guide to the effectiveness of the various workplace controls set in place to eliminate or reduce exposure to occupational hazards, including noise or ototoxic chemicals. The hierarchy includes the following from most effective to least effective:
* [[Hazard elimination|Elimination]]: complete removal of the hazard
* [[Hazard substitution|Substitution]]: replacement that offers a smaller risk
* [[Engineering controls]]: physical changes to reduce exposure
* [[Administrative controls]]: changes in work procedures or training
* [[Personal protective equipment]] (PPE): individual equipment to reduce exposure, e.g. [[earplug]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saunions.org.au/ohs/hierachy_of_controls.htm|title=Hierarchy of Controls|last=|first=|date=|website=SA Unions|publisher=|access-date=July 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/hierarchy/|title=Hierarchy of Controls|last=|first=|date=|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=|access-date=July 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Engineering controls ====
[[Engineering controls]] is the next highest in the [[hierarchy]] of risk reduction methods when elimination and substitution of the hazard are not possible. These types of controls typically involve making changes in equipment or other changes to minimize the level of noise that reaches a worker's ear. They may also involve measures such as barriers between the worker and the source of the noise, mufflers, regular maintenance of the machinery, or substituting quieter equipment.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noisecontrol/|title=NIOSH - Engineering Noise Control - Workplace Safety and Health Topic|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://miningsh.arizona.edu/node/46|title=Noise controls (Engineering, Administrative, PPE) {{!}} Mining Safety &amp; Health Resource Center|website=miningsh.arizona.edu|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OSHA Technical Manual (OTM) on noise provides technical information about workplace hazards and controls to OSHA’s Compliance Safety and Health Officers (CSHOs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/dts/osta/otm/new_noise/index.html|title=OSHA Technical Manual - Noise|last=OSHA|first=|date=Aug 15, 2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Jul 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The content of the OTM is based on currently available research publications, OSHA standards, and consensus standards. The OTM is available to the public for use by other health and safety professionals, employers, and anyone involved in developing or implementing an effective workplace safety and health program.

Examples of noise control strategies adopted in the workplace can be seen among the winners of the [[Safe-in-Sound Excellence in Hearing Loss Prevention Award|Safe-in-Sound Excellence in Hearing Loss Prevention Awards.]]

==== Administrative controls ====
[[Administrative controls|Administrative control]], behind engineering control, is the next best form of prevention of noise exposure.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They can either reduce the exposure to noise, or reduce the decibel level of the noise itself. Limiting the amount of time a worker is allowed to be around an unsafe level of noise exposure, and creating procedures for operation of equipment that could produce harmful levels of noise are both examples of administrative controls.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Personal protection ====
{{Main|Personal protective equipment}}
Elimination or reduction of the source of noise or chemical exposure is ideal, but when that is not possible or adequate, wearing [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE) such as earplugs or earmuffs can help reduce the risk of hearing loss due to noise exposure. PPE should be a last resort and  not be used in substitution for engineering or administrative controls. It is important that workers are properly trained on the use of PPE to ensure proper protection.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Other initiatives ===
In addition to the hierarchy of controls, other programs have been created to promote the prevention of hearing loss in the workplace. For example, the [[Buy Quiet]] program was created to encourage the purchase of quieter tools and machinery in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/buyquiet/|title=Buy Quiet|last=|first=|date=|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=|access-date=July 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[Safe-In-Sound Award|Safe-n-Sound Award]] was created to recognize organizations that excel in preventing occupational hearing loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.safeinsound.us/|title=Excellence in Hearing Loss Prevention Award|last=|first=|date=|website=Safe-in-Sound|publisher=|access-date=July 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Occupational hearing loss is a very present industrial issue that has been noticed since the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sataloff |first1=Robert Thayer |last2=Sataloff |first2=Joseph | name-list-format = vanc |title=Occupational hearing loss |date=1993 |publisher=M. Dekker |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8247-8814-8 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; As industrial society continues to grow, this issue is becoming increasingly detrimental due to the exposure of chemicals and physical objects. Millions of employees have been affected by occupational hearing loss, especially in industry.&lt;ref name="pmid11500698"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Al-Otaibi ST | title = Occupational hearing loss | journal = Saudi Medical Journal | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 523–30 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 11500698 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrialized countries see most of these damages as they result in both economic and living problems.

Within the United States of America alone, 10 of the 28 million people that have experienced hearing loss related to noise exposure. Rarely do workers express concerns or complaints regarding Occupational hearing loss. In order to gather relevant information, workers who have experienced loud work environments are questioned regarding their hearing abilities during everyday activities. When analyzing OHP, it is necessary to consider family history, hobbies, recreational activities, and how they could play a role in a person’s hearing loss. In order to test hearing loss, [[audiometer]]s are used to and are adjusted to [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) regulations. The Occupation and Safety Health Association (OSHA) of the United States of America requires a program that conserves hearing when noise levels are greater than 85&amp;nbsp;dB. This program includes:
1.”Monitoring to assess and record noise levels.”
2. “Periodic audiometry.”
3. “Noise Control”
4. “Education and record keeping.”

PhenX (consensus measures for Phenotypes and eXposures) is a community-driven effort to provide standard measures for use in biomedical research. The goals are to help investigators identify opportunities for collaborative biomedical research and improve the consistency of data collection.  The '''PhenX Toolkit''' is a web-based catalog of high-priority measures related to complex diseases, phenotypic traits and environmental exposures. These measures were selected by working groups of experts using a consensus process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |last1=Maiese |first1=Deborah R. |last2=Hendershot |first2=Tabitha P. |last3=Strader |first3=Lisa C. |last4=Wagener |first4=Diane K. |last5=Hammond |first5=Jane A. |last6=Huggins |first6=Wayne |last7=Kwok |first7=Richard K. |last8=Hancock |first8=Dana B. |last9=Whitehead |first9=Nedra S. |last10=Nettles |first10=Destiney S. |last11=Pratt |first11=Joseph G. |last12=Scott |first12=Marcia S. |last13=Conway |first13=Kevin P. |last14=Junkins |first14=Heather A. |last15=Ramos |first15=Erin M. |last16=Hamilton |first16=Carol M. |display-authors=3 |name-list-format=vanc |date=2013 |title=PhenX—Establishing a consensus process to select common measures for collaborative research |number=MR-0027-1310 |institution=RTI Press |location=Research Triangle Park, NC |doi=10.3768/rtipress.2013.mr.0027.1310 |doi-access=free |url=http://www.rti.org/publication/phenx%E2%80%94establishing-consensus-process-select-common-measures-collaborative-research }}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of PhenX measures facilitates combining data from a variety of studies, and makes it easy for investigators to expand a study design beyond the primary research focus.&lt;ref name="HaStPr2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hamilton |first1=Carol M. |last2=Strader |first2=Lisa C. |last3=Pratt |first3=Joseph G. |last4=Maiese |first4=Deborah |last5=Hendershot |first5=Tabitha |last6=Kwok |first6=Richard K. |last7=Hammond |first7=Jane A. |last8=Huggins |first8=Wayne |last9=Jackman |first9=Dean |last10=Pan |first10=Huaqin |last11=Nettles |first11=Destiney S. |last12=Beaty |first12=Terri H. |last13=Farrer |first13=Lindsay A. |last14=Kraft |first14=Peter |last15=Marazita |first15=Mary L. |last16=Ordovas |first16=Jose M. |last17=Pato |first17=Carlos N. |last18=Spitz |first18=Margaret R. |last19=Wagener |first19=Diane |last20=Williams |first20=Michelle |last21=Junkins |first21=Heather A. |last22=Harlan |first22=William R. |last23=Ramos |first23=Erin M. |last24=Haines |first24=Jonathan |display-authors=3 |name-list-format=vanc |title=The PhenX Toolkit: Get the Most From Your Measures |journal=American Journal of Epidemiology |volume=174 |issue=3 |pages=253–260 |date=1 August 2011 |pmc=3141081 |pmid=21749974 |doi=10.1093/aje/kwr193 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HePaHa2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Hendershot |first1=Tabitha |last2=Pan |first2=Huaqin |last3=Haines |first3=Jonathan |last4=Harlan |first4=William R. |last5=Junkins |first5=Heather A. |last6=Ramos |first6=Erin M. |last7=Hamilton |first7=Carol M. |display-authors=3 |name-list-format=vanc |title=Using the PhenX Toolkit to Add Standard Measures to Your Study |journal=Current Protocols in Human Genetics |volume=1 |issue=21 |date=October 2011 |pmid=21975939 |doi=10.1002/0471142905.hg0121s71 |at=Unit 1.21 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Toolkit==
The PhenX Toolkit is a catalog of measures recommended by domain experts, with browse and search capabilities and bioinformatics support.&lt;ref name="HaStPr2011" /&gt; PhenX measures and protocols are included in the Cancer Data Standards Repository (caDSR) [[Health informatics#Common Data Element in clinical research|Common Data Elements (CDE)]] Dictionary and the [[National Center for Biomedical Ontology]] (NCBO) BioPortal. PhenX protocols are available as [[Redcap (Research Electronic Data Capture)|REDCap]] Instrument Zip files, and work is underway to map PhenX variables to all studies in dbGaP.  PhenX provides easy access to standard measures with the potential to increase the overall impact of individual studies via cross-study analyses. For each measure, the PhenX Toolkit provides a brief description, the protocol for measurement with supporting images and tables, the reasons for selecting the protocol, details about training and equipment, translations available and selected  references.&lt;ref name="phenx1" /&gt; Users can browse research domains, measures, or collections, search using a “Smart Search” or a full text search, collect measures of interest in “My Toolkit”, and request custom data dictionaries and custom data collection worksheets.

The Toolkit can be particularly helpful when an investigator wants to expand a study to include measures that are outside his or her primary area of expertise.  Whereas study specific measures are needed to address the primary research goal, common measures are needed to increase the overall impact of the study; both types of measures are important to overall study design.

The "Link Your Study" feature allows registered users to share their study with other registered users or find other studies using the same protocols and identify opportunities for cross-study analysis.

==Protocols==
In addition to measures, PhenX also defines protocols. There may be multiple protocols defined for a measure. For example, for smoking cessation, there is an adult protocol (id: 030901) and adolescent protocol (id:030902).&lt;ref name="phenx1"&gt;{{cite web|title=PhenX Example Measure|url=https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/index.php?pageLink=browse.protocols&amp;id=30900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variables==
PhenX also provides a datatype (e.g., integer, string, date, enumerated, or encoded values) for each PhenX variable. For example, variable 'PX070501_Pregnancy_Outcome_1' for 'Outcome of Pregnancy?' is of type enumerated with value set of four possible values (Live birth,Still born,Miscarriage,Induced abortion).

The '''Physical Quality of Life Index''' (PQLI) is an attempt to measure the [[quality of life]] or well-being of a country. The value is the average of three statistics: basic literacy rate, infant mortality, and life expectancy at age one, all equally weighted on a 0 to 100 scale.

It was developed for the [[Overseas Development Council]] in the mid-1970s by Morris David Morris, as one of a number of measures created due to dissatisfaction with the use of [[gross national product|GNP]] as an indicator of development. PQLI might be regarded as an improvement but shares the general problems of measuring quality of life in a quantitative way. It has also been criticized because there is considerable overlap between infant mortality and life expectancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morris|first1=MD|title=The Physical Quality of Life Index (PQLI).|journal=Development digest|date=1980|volume=18|issue=1|pages=95–109|pmid=12261723}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[UN Human Development Index]] is a more widely used means of measuring well-being.

Steps to Calculate Physical Quality of Life:

1) Find percentage of the population that is literate (literacy rate).

2) Find the infant mortality rate. (out of 1000 births)
INDEXED Infant Mortality Rate = (166 - infant mortality) × 0.625

3) Find the Life Expectancy.
INDEXED Life Expectancy = (Life expectancy - 42) × 2.7

4) Physical Quality of Life =

                (Literacy Rate + INDEXED Infant Mortality Rate + INDEXED Life Expectancy)

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Priapism''' is a condition in which a [[penis]] remains [[erection|erect]] for hours in the absence of stimulation or after stimulation has ended.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; There are three types: [[ischemic]] (low-flow), nonischemic (high-flow), and recurrent ischemic (intermittent).&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Most cases are ischemic.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Ischemic priapism is generally painful while nonischemic priapism is not.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; In ischemic priapism, most of the penis is hard; however, the [[glans penis]] is not.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; In nonischemic priapism, the entire penis is only somewhat hard.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Very rarely, [[clitoral]] priapism occurs in women.&lt;ref name=Lehmiller2014&gt;{{cite book |authors=Justin J. Lehmiller|title=The Psychology of Human Sexuality|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|isbn=1119164702|year=2014|page=545|accessdate=February 8, 2018|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ytk5DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT545}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause, mechanism, and diagnosis --&gt;
[[Sickle cell disease]] is the most common cause of ischemic priapism.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Other causes include medications such as [[antipsychotic]]s, [[SSRIs]], and [[anticoagulants|blood thinners]], as well as drugs such as [[cocaine]] and [[cannabis]].&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Ischemic priapism occurs when blood does not adequately drain from the penis.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Nonischemic priapism is typically due to a connection forming between an [[artery]] and the [[Corpus cavernosum penis|corpus cavernosum]] or disruption of the [[parasympathetic nervous system]] resulting in increased arterial flow.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Nonischemic priapism may occur following trauma to the penis or a [[spinal cord injury]].&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Diagnosis may be supported by [[blood gas]] analysis of blood aspirated from the penis or [[ultrasound]].&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment, prognosis, and epidemiology--&gt;
Treatment depends on the type.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Ischemic priapism is typically treated with a [[nerve block]] of the penis followed by aspiration of blood from the corpora cavernosa.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; If this is not sufficient, the corpus cavernosum may be irrigated with cold [[normal saline]] or injected with [[phenylephrine]].&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Nonischemic priapism is often treated with cold packs and compression.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Surgery may be done if usual measures are not effective.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; In ischemic priapism, the risk of permanent scarring of the penis begins to increase after four hours and definitely occurs after 48 hours.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salam|first1=Muhammad A.|title=Principles &amp; Practice of Urology: A Comprehensive Text|date=2003|publisher=Universal-Publishers|isbn=9781581124118|page=342|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=QPSWilXhECkC&amp;pg=PA342|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427100327/https://books.google.ca/books?id=QPSWilXhECkC&amp;pg=PA342|archivedate=2017-04-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Priapism occurs in about 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 100,000 males per year.&lt;ref name=EM2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Podolej|first1=GS|last2=Babcock|first2=C|title=Emergency Department Management Of Priapism.|journal=Emergency medicine practice|date=January 2017|volume=19|issue=1|pages=1–16|pmid=28027457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Priapism is classified into three groups: ischemic (low-flow), nonischemic (high-flow), and recurrent ischemic.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; The majority of cases (19 out of 20) are ischemic in nature.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;

Some sources give a duration of four hours as a definition of priapism, but others give six: "The duration of a normal erection before it is classifiable as priapism is still controversial. Ongoing penile erections for more than 6 hours can be classified as priapism."&lt;ref name="scielo.br"&gt;PRIAPISM&amp;nbsp;– ETIOLOGY, PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT, C. VAN DER HORST, HENRIK STUEBINGER, CHRISTOPH SEIF, DIETHILD MELCHIOR, F.J. MARTÍNEZ-PORTILLO, K.P. JUENEMANN; {{cite web |url=http://www.scielo.br/pdf/ibju/v29n5/18554.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429234259/http://www.scielo.br/pdf/ibju/v29n5/18554.pdf |archivedate=2013-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Priapism in females (continued, painful erection of the [[clitoris]]) is significantly rarer than priapism in men, and is known as clitoral priapism or clitorism.&lt;ref name="Lehmiller2014" /&gt; It is associated with [[persistent genital arousal disorder]] (PGAD).&lt;ref name="Carcio"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Helen Carcio, MS, MEd, ANP-BC, R. Mimi Secor, MS, MEd, FNP-BC, NCMP, FAANP|title=Advanced Health Assessment of Women, Third Edition: Clinical Skills and Procedures|publisher=[[Springer Publishing Company]]|isbn=0826123090|year=2014|page=85|accessdate=February 8, 2018|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q4QbBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few case reports of women experiencing clitoral priapism exist.&lt;ref name="Lehmiller2014" /&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
===Complications===
Because [[ischemia|ischemic]] priapism causes the blood to remain in the penis for unusually long periods of time, the blood becomes deprived of oxygen and can cause damage to the penile tissue itself. Should the penile tissue become damaged, it can result in [[erectile dysfunction]] or disfigurement of the penis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/priapism/basics/complications/con-20029378 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806005205/http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/priapism/basics/complications/con-20029378 |archivedate=2014-08-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In extreme cases, if the penis develops severe vascular disease, the priapism can result in penile [[gangrene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Penile Gangrene: An Unusual Complication of Priapism in a Patient with Bladder Carcinoma| pmc=3192523 | pmid=22022653 | doi=10.4103/2006-8808.78470| volume=3| year=2011| journal=J Surg Tech Case Rep| pages=37–9| author=Ajape AA, Bello A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Priapism may be associated with [[hematology|haematological]] disorders, especially [[sickle-cell disease]], sickle-cell trait, and other conditions such as [[leukemia]], [[thalassemia]], and [[Fabry's disease]], and [[neurology|neurologic disorders]] such as [[spinal cord]] lesions and spinal cord trauma (priapism has been reported in people who have been hanged; see [[death erection]]).

Priapism may also be associated with [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]], which leads to decreased [[NADPH]] levels. NADPH is a co-factor involved in the formation of nitric oxide, which may result in priapism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Finley DS | title = Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency associated stuttering priapism: report of a case | journal = [[J Sex Med]] | volume = 5 | issue = 12 | pages = 2963–6 |date=December 2008 | pmid = 18823322 | doi = 10.1111/j.1743-6109.2008.01007.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sickle cell disease often presents special treatment obstacles. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has also been used with success in some patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Macaluso JN | title = Priapism: Update for the non-urologist | journal = Sexual Medicine Today | volume = 9 | pages = 11–15 | year = 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Priapism is also found to occur in extreme cases of [[rabies]]. Priapism also occurs due to encephalitic rabies.

===Medications===
Priapism can also be caused by reactions to [[medication]]s. The most common medications that cause priapism are intra-cavernous injections for treatment of [[erectile dysfunction]] ([[papaverine]], [[alprostadil]]). Other groups reported are [[antihypertensives]], [[antipsychotic]]s (e.g., [[chlorpromazine]], [[clozapine]]), [[antidepressant]]s (most notably [[trazodone]]), [[anti-convulsant]] and [[mood stabilizer]] drugs such as [[sodium valproate]],&lt;ref name="Bansal"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bansal S, Gupta SK | title = Sodium Valproate induced priapism in an adult with bipolar affective disorder | journal = [[Indian Journal of Pharmacology]] | volume = 45 | issue = 6 | pages = 629 |date=November 2013 | doi = 10.4103/0253-7613.121383}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[anticoagulants]], [[cantharides]] (''Spanish Fly'') and recreational drugs ([[alcohol]], [[heroin]] and [[cocaine]]). Priapism is also known to occur from bites of the [[Brazilian wandering spider]] and the [[Latrodectus|black widow spider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/erectile-dysfunction/news/20090924/spider-venom-for-erectile-dysfunction|title=Spider Venom for Erectile Dysfunction?|work=webmd.com|accessdate=11 February 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211214317/http://www.webmd.com/erectile-dysfunction/news/20090924/spider-venom-for-erectile-dysfunction|archivedate=11 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
The mechanisms are poorly understood but involve complex neurological and [[vascular]] factors.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is often based on the history of the condition and the [[physical exam]].&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;

[[Blood gas]] testing the blood from the cavernosa of the penis can help in the diagnosis.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; If the low flow type of priapism is present the blood typically has a low pH while if the high flow type is present the pH is typically normal.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Color doppler [[ultrasound]] may also help differentiate the two.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Testing a person to make sure they do not have a [[hemoglobinopathy]] may also be reasonable.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;

==Treatment==

Medical evaluation is recommended for erections that last for longer than four hours. Pain can often be reduced with a [[dorsal penile nerve]] block or penile [[ring block]].&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; For those with nonischemic priapism cold packs and pressure to the area may be sufficient.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;

===Aspiration===
For those with ischemic priapism the initial treatment is typically [[Suction (medicine)|aspiration]] of blood from the [[Corpus cavernosum penis|corpus cavernosum]].&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; This is done on either side.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; If this is not sufficiently effective then cold [[normal saline]] may be injected and removed.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;

===Medications===
If aspiration is not sufficient a small dose of [[phenylephrine]] may be injected into the corpus cavernosum.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Side effects of phenylephrine may include [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[bradycardia|slow heart rate]], and [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]].&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; If this medication is used, it is recommended that people be monitored for at least an hour after.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; For those with recurrent ischemic priapism [[diethylstilbestrol]] (DES) or [[terbutaline]] may be tried.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;

===Surgery===
Distal shunts, such as the [[George D. Winter|Winter's]],{{clarify|date=November 2009}} involve puncturing the glans (the distal part of the penis) into one of the cavernosa, where the old, stagnant blood is held. This causes the blood to leave the penis and return to the circulation. This procedure can be performed by a urologist at the bedside. Winter's shunts are often the first invasive technique used, especially in hematologically induced priapism, as it is relatively simple and repeatable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Macaluso JN, Sullivan JW | title = Priapism: A review of 34 cases | journal = Urology | volume = 26 | pages = 233–236 | year = 1985 | doi = 10.1016/0090-4295(85)90116-5 | pmid = 4035837 | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proximal shunts, such as the Quackel's,{{clarify|date=November 2009}} are more involved and entail operative dissection in the [[perineum]] to where the corpora meet the spongiosum, making an incision in both, and suturing both openings together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Montague DK, Jarow J, Broderick GA, Dmochowski RR, Heaton JP, Lue TF, Nehra A, Sharlip ID | title = American Urological Association guideline on the management of priapism | journal = [[J. Urol.]] | volume = 170 | issue = 4 Pt 1 | pages = 1318–24 |date=October 2003 | pmid = 14501756 | doi = 10.1097/01.ju.0000087608.07371.ca }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shunts created between corpora cavernosa and saphenous vein called Grayhack shunt can be done though this technique is rarely used.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

As the complication rates with prolonged priapism are high, early [[penile prosthesis]] implantation may be considered.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; As well as allowing early resumption of sexual activity, early implantation can avoid the formation of dense fibrosis and hence a shortened penis.

===Sickle cell anemia===
In sickle-cell anemia treatment is initially with [[intravenous fluids]], [[pain medication]], and [[oxygen therapy]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; The typical treatment of priapism may be carried out as well.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; [[Blood transfusions]] are not usually recommended as part of the initial treatment but if other treatments are not effective [[exchange transfusion]] may be done.&lt;ref name=NIH2014&gt;{{cite book|title=Evidence Based Management of Sickle Cell Disease|date=2014|publisher=NHLBI|pages=39–40|url=https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/sites/www.nhlbi.nih.gov/files/sickle-cell-disease-report.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170125155233/https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/sites/www.nhlbi.nih.gov/files/sickle-cell-disease-report.pdf|archivedate=2017-01-25|df=|access-date=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;

==History==
Persistent semi-erections or intermittent states of prolonged erections have historically been sometimes called semi-priapism.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Herbert F., and Jane D. Northup. "Mechanism of human penile erection: an overview." Urology 17.5 (1981): 399-408.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terminology===
The name comes from the Greek god [[Priapus]] ({{lang-grc|Πρίαπος}}), a fertility god often represented with a disproportionately large and permanent erection.

Nearly half of all [[refugee]]s are children, and almost one in three children living outside their country of birth is a [[refugee]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Emily Garin, Jan Beise, Lucia Hug, and Danzhen You. 2016. “Uprooted: The Growing Crisis for Refugee and Migrant Children.” UNICEF. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.unicef.org/videoaudio/PDFs/Uprooted.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; These numbers encompass children whose [[Refugee#Refugee status|refugee status]] has been formally confirmed, as well as children in refugee-like situations.

In addition to facing the direct threat of violence resulting from conflict, forcibly displaced children also face various health risks, including: disease outbreaks&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; and long-term [[psychological trauma]],&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; inadequate access to water and sanitation,&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; nutritious food,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; and regular vaccination schedules.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; '''Refugee children''', particularly those without documentation and those who travel alone, are also vulnerable to [[Child abuse|abuse]] and exploitation.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; Although many communities around the world have welcomed them, forcibly displaced children and their families often face [[discrimination]], [[poverty]], and social marginalization in their home, transit, and destination countries.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Language barriers and legal barriers in transit and destination countries often bar refugee children and their families from accessing education, healthcare, social protection, and other services.&amp;nbsp;Many countries of destination also lack intercultural supports and policies for social integration.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Such threats to safety and well-being are amplified for refugee children with disabilities.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;

==Legal protection==
{{see|Refugee law}}
The [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], the most widely ratified human rights treaty in history, includes four articles that are particularly relevant to children involved in or affected by forced displacement:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;UNICEF. "Convention on the Rights of the Child."&amp;nbsp;''Child Labor'' (1989): 8.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the principle of non-discrimination (Article 2)
* best interests of the child (Article 3)
* right to life and survival and development (Article 6)
* the right to child participation (Article 12)
States Parties to the Convention are obliged to uphold the above articles, regardless of a child's migration status.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As of November 2005, a total of 192 countries have become States Parties to the Convention.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.unicef.org/crc/index_30229.html|title=Frequently asked questions|work=UNICEF|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somalia and the United States are the only two countries that have not ratified it.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|United Nations 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees]] is a comprehensive and rigid legal code regarding the rights of refugees at an international level and it also defines under which conditions a person should be considered as a refugee and thus be given these rights.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Steinbock, Daniel J. "The refugee definition as law: issues of interpretation."&amp;nbsp;''Refugee Rights and Realities: Evolving International Concepts and Regimes''&amp;nbsp;(1999): 13-39.&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention provides protection to forcibly displaced persons who have experienced persecution or torture in their home countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For countries that have ratified it, the Convention often serves as the primary basis for refugee status determination, but some countries also utilize other refugee definitions, thus, have granted refugee status not based exclusively on persecution. For instance, the African Union has agreed on a definition at the [[1969 Refugee Convention]], that also accommodates people affected by external aggression, occupation, foreign domination, and events seriously disturbing public order.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;“Refugee Status Determination: Identifying Who Is a Refugee.” 2005. Geneva: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa has granted refugee status to Mozambicans and Zimbabweans following the collapse of their home countries’ economies.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, Joanne.&amp;nbsp;''I am an African: stories of young refugees in South Africa''. New Africa Books, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other international legal tools for the protection refugee children include two of the Protocols supplementing the [[United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime]] which reference child migration:
* the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children;&lt;ref&gt;UN General Assembly. "Protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children, supplementing the United Nations convention against transnational organized crime."&amp;nbsp;''GA res''&amp;nbsp;55 (2000): 25.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea, and Air.&lt;ref&gt;UN General Assembly. "Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, Supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime." (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally the [[International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families]] covers the rights of the children of migrant workers in both regular and irregular situations during the entire migration process.

== Stages of the refugee experience ==
Refugee experiences can be categorized into three stages of migration: home country experiences (pre-migration), transit experiences (transmigration), and host country experiences (post-migration).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Richard J., and Dennis Moore, eds.&amp;nbsp;''Educational interventions for refugee children: Theoretical perspectives and implementing best practice''. Psychology Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Lustig, Stuart L., Maryam Kia-Keating, Wanda Grant Knight, Paul Geltman, Heidi Ellis, J. David Kinzie, Terence Keane, and Glenn N. Saxe. "Review of child and adolescent refugee mental health."&amp;nbsp;''Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry''&amp;nbsp;43, no. 1 (2004): 24-36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Bhugra, Dinesh, Susham Gupta, Kamaldeep Bhui, T. O. M. Craig, Nisha Dogra, J. David Ingleby, James Kirkbride et al. "WPA guidance on mental health and mental health care in migrants."&amp;nbsp;''World Psychiatry''&amp;nbsp;10, no. 1 (2011): 2-10.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the large majority of refugees do not travel into new host countries, but remain in the transmigration stage, living in refugee camps or [[urban refugee|urban centres]] waiting to be able to [[voluntary return|return]] home.

===Home country experiences (pre-migration)===
[[File:DRC- Child Soldiers.jpg|thumb|Former child soldiers in the eastern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].]]
The pre-migration stage refers to home country experiences leading up to and including the decision to flee. Pre-migration experiences include the challenges and threats children face that drive them to seek refuge in another country.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Will H., and Stephen M. Shellman. "Refugee or internally displaced person? To where should one flee?."&amp;nbsp;''Comparative Political Studies''&amp;nbsp;39, no. 5 (2006): 599-622.&lt;/ref&gt; Refugee children migrate, either with their families or unaccompanied, due to fear of persecution on the premise of membership of a particular social group, or due to the threat of [[forced marriage]], [[Child labour|forced labor]], or conscription into armed forces.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Hamilton, Carolyn, Kirsten Anderson, Ruth Barnes, and Kamena Dorling. "Administrative detention of children: a global report."&amp;nbsp;''Fondo de las Naciones Unidas para la Infancia, Nueva York''&amp;nbsp;(2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Others may leave to escape famine or in order to ensure the safety and security of themselves and their families from the destruction of war or internal conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Achvarina, Vera, and Simon F. Reich. "No place to hide: Refugees, displaced persons, and the recruitment of child soldiers."&amp;nbsp;''International Security''&amp;nbsp;31, no. 1 (2006): 127-164.&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2016 report by UNICEF found that, by the end of 2015, five years of open conflict in the [[Syria|Syrian Arab Republic]] had forced 4.9 million Syrians out of the country, half of which were children. The same report found that, by the end of 2015, more than ten years of armed conflict in Afghanistan had forced 2.7 million Afghans beyond the country's borders; half of the refugees from Afghanistan were children.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; During times of war, in addition to being exposed to violence, many children are abducted and forced to become soldiers.&lt;ref name="United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.un.org/disarmament/HomePage/ODAPublications/OccasionalPapers/PDF/OP14.pdf|title=Conflict of Interests: Children and Guns in Zones of Instability|last=United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs: Panel Discussion at the United Nations.|date=February 2009|publisher=UNODA Occasional Papers No. 14: New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.1}} According to an estimate, 12,000 refugee children have been recruited into armed groups within South Sudan.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Davies, Susanna, and Carol Batchelor. "Resettlement as a protection tool for refugee children."&amp;nbsp;''Forced Migration Review'' 54 (2017): 38.&lt;/ref&gt; War itself often becomes a part of the child's [[Identity (social science)|identity]], making [[Social integration|reintegration]] difficult once he or she is removed from the unstable environment.&lt;ref name="United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs" /&gt;{{rp|p.3}}

Examples of children's pre-migration experiences: 
* Some Sudanese refugee children reported that they had either experienced personally or witnessed potentially traumatic events prior to departure from their home country, during attacks by the Sudanese military in [[Darfur]]. These events include instances of sexual violence, as well as of individuals being beaten, shot, bound, stabbed, strangled, drowned, and kidnapped.&lt;ref&gt;Rasmussen, Andrew, Basila Katoni, Allen S. Keller, and John Wilkinson. "Posttraumatic idioms of distress among Darfur refugees: Hozun and Majnun."&amp;nbsp;''Transcultural Psychiatry''&amp;nbsp;48, no. 4 (2011): 392-415.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some [[Burma|Burmese]] refugee children in Australia were found to have undergone severe pre-migration traumas, including the lack of food, water, and shelter, forced separation from family members, murder of family or friends, kidnappings, sexual abuse, and torture.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;Schweitzer, Robert D., Mark Brough, Lyn Vromans, and Mary Asic-Kobe.

* In 2014 the President of [[Honduras]] testified in front of the [[United States Congress]] that more than three-quarters of unaccompanied child migrants from Honduras came from the country's most violent cities.&lt;ref&gt;“Central America and Mexico Unaccompanied Child Migration Situation Report No. 1.” 2014. United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, 58 percent of 404 unaccompanied and separated children interviewed by the UN Refugee Agency, [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]], about their journey to the United States indicated that they had been forcibly displaced from their homes because they had either been harmed or were under threat of harm.&lt;ref&gt;“Unaccompanied Children Leaving Central America and Mexico and the Need for International Protection.” 2014. Washington, DC: UNHCR.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, children may also cross borders for economic reasons, such as to escape poverty and social deprivation, or some children may do so to join other family members already settled in another State. But it is the involuntary nature of refugees' departure that distinguishes them from other migrant groups who have not undergone forced displacement.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Bemak, Fred, Rita Chi-Ying Chung, and Paul Pedersen.&amp;nbsp;''Counseling refugees: A psychosocial approach to innovative multicultural interventions''.

=== Transit experiences (transmigration) ===
The transmigration period is characterized by the physical relocation of refugees. This process includes the journey between home countries and host countries and often involves time spent in a refugee camp.&lt;ref&gt;Bhugra, Dinesh, and Peter Jones. "Migration and mental illness."&amp;nbsp;''Advances in Psychiatric Treatment''&amp;nbsp;7, no. 3 (2001): 216-222.&lt;/ref&gt; Children may experience arrest, detention, sexual assault, and torture during their translocation to the host country.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;Kaplan, Ida. "Effects of trauma and the refugee experience on psychological assessment processes and interpretation."&amp;nbsp;''Australian Psychologist''&amp;nbsp;44, no. 1 (2009): 6-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Children, particularly those who travel on their own or become separated from their families, are likely to face various forms of violence and exploitation throughout the transmigration period.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The experience of traveling from one country to another is much more difficult for women and children, because they are more vulnerable to assaults and exploitation by people they encounter at the border and in refugee camps.&lt;ref&gt;Kira, Ibrahim A., Iris Smith, Linda Lewandowski, and Thomas Templin. "The effects of gender discrimination on refugee torture survivors: A cross-cultural traumatology perspective."&amp;nbsp;''Journal of the American Psychiatric Nurses Association''&amp;nbsp;16, no. 5 (2010): 299-306.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Trafficking ====
[[People smuggling|Smuggling]], in which a smuggler illegally moves a migrant into another country, is a pervasive issue for children travelling both with and without their families.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; While fleeing their country of origin, many unaccompanied children end up travelling with [[Human trafficking|traffickers]]  who may attempt to exploit them as workers.&lt;ref name="Kielburger"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/globalvoices/article/587381--refugee-children-can-feel-abandoned-in-new-land|title=Refugee Children can Feel Abandoned in New Land|last=Kielburger|first=C.|work=The Star Online|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Including adults, sex trafficking is more prevalent in Europe and Central Asia, whereas in East Asia, South Asia, and the Pacific labour trafficking is more prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;“Global Report on Trafficking in Persons 2016.” Vienna, Austria: United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many unaccompanied children fleeing from conflict zones in [[Moldova]], [[Romania]], [[Ukraine]], [[Nigeria]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[China]], [[Afghanistan]] or [[Sri Lanka]] are forced into [[sex trafficking|sexual exploitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Not for Sale: The Return of the Global Slave Trade—and How We Can Fight It|last=Batstone|first=David|year=2010|isbn=978-0-06-202372-8}}{{page needed|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mehrunnisa"&gt;{{cite book|title=Unaccompanied / separated children seeking refugee status in Ontario : a review of documented policies and practices|last1=Ali|first1=Mehrunnisa|last2=Gill|first2=Jagjeet Kaur|last3=Taraban|first3=Svitlana|year=2003|oclc=246931353}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.9}} Especially vulnerable groups include girls belonging to single-parent households, unaccompanied children, children from child-headed households, orphans, girls who were street traders, and girls whose mothers were street traders.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; While refugee boys have been identified as the main victims of exploitation in the labor market, refugee girls aged between 13 and 18 have been the main targets of sexual exploitation.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In particular, the number of young [[Nigerians|Nigerian]] women and girls brought into [[Italy]] for exploitation has been increasing: it was reported that 3,529 Nigerian women, among them underage girls, arrived by sea between January and June 2016. Once they reached Italy, these girls worked under conditions of slavery, for periods typically ranging from three to seven years.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;“Young Invisible Enslaved: The Child Victims at the Heart of Trafficking and Exploitation in Italy.” Save the Children Italia Onlus, November 2016. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.savethechildren.net/sites/default/files/libraries/young%20invisible%20enslaved%204%20low.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Detention ====
Children may be [[administrative detention|detained]] in prisons, military facilities, immigration detention centers, welfare centers, or educational facilities. While detained, migrant children are deprived of a range of rights, such as the right to physical and mental health, privacy, education, and leisure. And many countries do not have a legal time limit for detention, leaving some children incarcerated for indeterminate time periods.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Flynn, Michael.&amp;nbsp;''An introduction to data construction on immigration-related detention''. Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Some children are even detained together with adults and subjected to a harsher, adult-based treatment and regimen.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

In [[North Africa]], children travelling without legal status are frequently subjected to extended periods of immigration detention.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Children held in administrative detention in [[Palestinian territories|Palestine]] only receive a limited amount of education, and those held in interrogation centers receive no education at all. In two of the prisons visited by Defense for Children International Palestine, education was found to be limited to two hours a week.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; It has also been reported that child administrative detainees in Palestine do not receive sufficient food to meet their daily nutritional requirements.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Documented cases of child detention are available for more than 100 countries, ranging from the highest to the lowest income nations.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Even so, a growing number of countries, including both [[Panama]] and [[Mexico]], prohibit the detention of child migrants.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Mitchell, Grant. "Engaging Governments on Alternatives to Immigration Detention."&amp;nbsp;''Global Detention Project''&amp;nbsp;(2016).&lt;/ref&gt; And [[Yemen]] has adopted a community-driven approach, using small-group alternative care homes for child refugees and asylum-seekers, as a more age-appropriate way of detention.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In the United States unaccompanied children are placed in single purpose non-secure “children’s shelters” for immigration violations, rather than in juvenile detention facilities. However, this change has not ended the practice of administrative detention entirely.&lt;ref&gt;Fazel, Mina, Unni Karunakara, and Elizabeth A. Newnham. "Detention, denial, and death: migration hazards for refugee children."&amp;nbsp;''The Lancet Global Health''&amp;nbsp;2, no. 6 (2014): e313-e314.&lt;/ref&gt;
Although there is commitment by the Council of Europe to work toward ending the detention of children for migration control purposes, asylum-seeking and migrant children and families often undergo detention experiences that conflict with international commitments.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==== Refugee camps ====
Some [[refugee camp]]s operate at levels below acceptable standards of environmental health; overcrowding and a lack of wastewater networks and sanitation systems are common.&lt;ref&gt;Farah, Randa. "A report on the psychological effects of overcrowding in refugee camps in the West Bank and Gaza Strip."&amp;nbsp;''Prepared for the Expert and Advisory Services Fund—International Development Research Centre, Canada: IDRC'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Bruijn, Bart.&amp;nbsp;''The Living Conditions and Well-being of Refugees''. No. 19208. University Library of Munich, Germany, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;Cronin, A. A., D. Shrestha, N. Cornier, F. Abdalla, N. Ezard, and C. Aramburu. "A review of water and sanitation provision in refugee camps in association with selected health and nutrition indicators–the need for integrated service provision."&amp;nbsp;''Journal of water and health''&amp;nbsp;6, no. 1 (2008): 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardships of a refugee camp may also contribute to symptoms following a refugee child's discharge from a camp. A small number of [[Cubans|Cuban]] refugee children and adolescents, who were detained in a refugee camp, were assessed months after their release, and it was found that 57 percent of the youth exhibited moderate to severe [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Rothe, Eugenio M., John Lewis, Hector Castillo-Matos, Orestes Martinez, Ruben Busquets, and Igna Martinez. "Posttraumatic stress disorder among Cuban children and adolescents after release from a refugee camp."&amp;nbsp;''Psychiatric Services''&amp;nbsp;53, no. 8 (2002): 970-976.&lt;/ref&gt; Unaccompanied girls at refugee camps may also face harassment or assault from camp guards and fellow male refugees.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Asaf, Yumna. "Syrian Women and the Refugee Crisis: Surviving the Conflict, Building Peace, and Taking New Gender Roles."&amp;nbsp;''Social Sciences''&amp;nbsp;6, no. 3 (2017): 110.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to having poor infrastructure and limited support services, there are a few refugee camps that can present danger to refugee children and families by housing members of armed forces. Also, at a few refugee camps, militia forces may try to recruit and abduct children.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Host country experiences (post-migration)===
The third stage, host country experiences, is the integration of refugees into the social, political, economic, and cultural framework of the host country society. The post-migration period involves adaptation to a new culture and re-defining one's identity and place in the new society.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This stress can be exacerbated when the children arrive in the host country and are expected to adapt quickly to a new setting.&lt;ref&gt;Marar, Marianne Maurice. "I know there is no justice: Palestinian perceptions of higher education in Jordan."&amp;nbsp;''Intercultural Education'' 22, no. 2 (2011): 177-190.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is only a minority of refugees who travel into new host countries and who are allowed to start a new life there. Most refugees are living in refugee camps or urban centres waiting to be able to return home. For those who are starting a new life in a new country there are two options:
 
==== Seeking asylum ====
[[Asylum seeker]]s are people who have formally applied for asylum in another country and who are still waiting for a decision on their status.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Sarah. "Something to smile about: Promoting and supporting the educational and recreational needs of refugee children."&amp;nbsp;''Refugee Council''&amp;nbsp;(2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Once they have received a positive response from the host government, they will legally be considered as refugees. Refugees, like citizens of the host country, have the rights to education, health, and social services, whereas asylum seekers do not.&lt;ref&gt;Bhugra, Dinesh. "Migration and mental health."&amp;nbsp;''Acta psychiatrica scandinavica''&amp;nbsp;109, no. 4 (2004): 243-258.&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, the majority of refugees and migrants who arrived in Europe in 2015 through mid-2016 were accommodated in overcrowded transit centers and informal settlements, where privacy and access to education and health services were often limited.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In some accommodation centers in [[Germany]] and [[Sweden]], where asylum seekers stayed until their claims were processed, separate living spaces for women, as well as sex-separated latrines and shower facilities, were unavailable.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

[[Unaccompanied minor|Unaccompanied children]] face particular difficulties throughout the asylum process. They are minors who are separated from their families once they reach the host country, or minors who decide to travel from their home countries to a foreign country without a parent or guardian.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Meda, Lawrence. 2013. “Refugee Learner Experiences : A Case Study of Zimbabwean Refugee Children.” Thesis. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://researchspace.ukzn.ac.za/handle/10413/12135&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; More children are traveling alone, with nearly 100,000 unaccompanied children in 2015 filing claims for [[Right of asylum|asylum]] in 78 countries.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Bhabha (2004) argues that it is more challenging for unaccompanied children than adults to gain asylum, as unaccompanied children are usually unable to find appropriate legal representation and stand up for themselves during the application process.&lt;ref&gt;Bhabha, Jacqueline. "Seeking Asylum Alone: Treatment of separated and trafficked children in need of refugee protection."&amp;nbsp;''International migration''&amp;nbsp;42, no. 1 (2004): 141-148.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Australia]], for instance, unaccompanied children, who usually do not have any kind of legal assistance, must prove beyond any reasonable doubt that they are in need of the country's protection.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;Crock, Mary.&amp;nbsp;''Seeking asylum alone: A study of Australian law, policy and practice regarding unaccompanied and separated children''. Federation Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Many children do not have the necessary documents for legal entry into a host country, often avoiding officials due to fear of being caught and deported to their home countries.&lt;ref&gt;Elwyn, H., C. Gladwell, and S. Lyall. "I Just Want to Study: Access to Higher Education for Young Refugees and Asylum Seekers."&amp;nbsp;''London, Refugee Support Network''&amp;nbsp;(2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Without documented status, unaccompanied children often face challenges in acquiring education and healthcare in many countries. These factors make them particularly vulnerable to hunger, homelessness, and sexual and labor exploitation.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;Vandenhole, Wouter, Ellen Desmet, Didier Reynaert, and Sara Lembrechts, eds.&amp;nbsp;''Routledge international handbook of children’s rights studies''. Routledge, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Displaced youth, both male and female, are vulnerable to recruitment into armed groups.&lt;ref&gt;Lischer, Sarah Kenyon. "War, displacement, and the recruitment of child soldiers."&amp;nbsp;''Child Soldiers Initiative Working Group Session Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania''&amp;nbsp;(2006): 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Unaccompanied children may also resort to dangerous jobs to meet their own survival needs.&lt;ref&gt;Bhabha, Jacqueline, and Susan Schmidt.

==== Refugee resettlement ====
[[Third country resettlement]]&amp;nbsp;refers to the transfer of refugees from the country they have fled to another country that is more suitable to their needs and that has agreed to grant them permanent settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/resettlement.html|title=Resettlement|last=|first=|date=|website=UNHCR|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the number of places available for resettlement is less than the number needed for children for whom resettlement would be most appropriate.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Some nations have prioritized children at risk as a category for resettlement:

The United States established its Unaccompanied Refugee Minor Program in 1980 to support unaccompanied children for resettlement. The [[Office of Refugee Resettlement]] (ORR) by the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] currently works with state and local service providers to provide unaccompanied refugee children with resettlement and foster care services. This service is guaranteed to unaccompanied refugee minors until they reach the age of majority or until they are reunited with their families.&lt;ref&gt;Huemer, Julia, Niranjan S. Karnik, Sabine Voelkl-Kernstock, Elisabeth Granditsch, Kanita Dervic, Max H. Friedrich, and Hans Steiner. "Mental health issues in unaccompanied refugee minors."&amp;nbsp;''Child and adolescent psychiatry and mental health''&amp;nbsp;3, no. 1 (2009): 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some European nations have established programs to support the resettlement and integration of refugee children.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The European countries admitting the most refugee children in 2016 via resettlement were the United Kingdom (2,525 refugee children), Norway (1,930), Sweden (915), and Germany (595). Together, these accounted for 66% of the child resettlement admissions to all of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;“Refugee and Migrant Children in Europe: Accompanied, Unaccompanied, and Separated (Quarterly Overview of Trends: January - March 2017).” UNHCR, UNICEF, IOM, 2017. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://data2.unhcr.org/en/documents/download/58431&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Kingdom]] also established a new initiative in 2016 to support the resettlement of vulnerable refugee children from the Middle East and North Africa, regardless of family separation status.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; It was reported in February 2017 that this program has been partially suspended by the government; the program would no longer accept refugee youth with "complex needs," such as those with disabilities, until further notice.&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;Agerholm, Harriet. "Disabled child refugees entry to UK through resettlement scheme suspended by Home Office." The Independent. February 09, 2017. Accessed December 05, 2017. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/disabled-child-refugees-uk-suspend-entry-home-office-resettlement-unhcr-united-nations-lord-dubs-a7571451.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
Refugee children without caretakers have a greater risk of exhibiting psychiatric symptoms of mental illnesses following traumatic stress.&lt;ref name="Lustig"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Lustig| first = Stuart L.| title = Review of Child and Adolescent Refugee Health | publisher = National Child Traumatic Stress Network: USA| year = 2003 | url = http://www.evasp.eu/attachments/117_Review%20of%20Child%20and%20Adolescent%20Refugee%20Mental%20Health.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.9}} Unaccompanied refugee children display more behavioral problems and emotional distress than refugee children with caretakers.&lt;ref name="Lustig"/&gt;{{rp|p.9}} Parental well-being plays a crucial role in enabling resettled refugees to transition into a new society. If a child is separated from his/her caretakers during the process of resettlement, the likelihood that he/she will develop a mental illness increases.&lt;ref name="Lustig"/&gt;{{rp|p.17}}

==Health==
{{See also|Refugee health|l1=Refugee Health}}

This section covers health throughout the different stages of the refugee experience.

=== Health status ===

==== Nutrition ====
Refugee children arriving in the United States often come from countries with a high prevalence of undernutrition.&lt;ref name="Lutfy, Caitlyn 2014"&gt;Lutfy, Caitlyn, Susan T. Cookson, Leisel Talley, and Roger Rochat. "Malnourished children in refugee camps and lack of connection with services after US resettlement."&amp;nbsp;''[[Journal of Immigrant and Minority Health]]''&amp;nbsp;16, no. 5 (2014): 1016-1022.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly half of a sample of refugee children who arrived to the American state of Washington, the majority of which were from Iraq, Somalia, and Burma, were found to have at least one form of malnutrition. In the under five age range refugee children had significantly higher rates of [[wasting syndrome]] and [[stunted growth]], as well as a lower prevalence of obesity, in comparison to low-income non-refugee children.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;Dawson-Hahn, Elizabeth E., Suzinne Pak-Gorstein, Andrea J. Hoopes, and Jasmine Matheson. "Comparison of the nutritional status of overseas refugee children with low income children in Washington state."&amp;nbsp;''PLOS One''&amp;nbsp;11, no. 1 (2016): e0147854.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some time after they arrived in the United States and Australia, many refugee children demonstrated an increasing rate of overnutrition. An Australian study, assessing the nutritional status of 337 sub-Saharan African children aged between three and 12 years, found that the prevalence rate for overweight amongt refugee children was 18.4%.&lt;ref&gt;Renzaho, Andre, Carl Gibbons, Boyd Swinburn, Damien Jolley, and Catherine Burns. "Obesity and undernutrition in sub-Saharan African immigrant and refugee children in Victoria, Australia." PhD diss., Healthy Eating Club, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence rate of overweight and obesity among refugee children in [[Rhode Island]], increased from 17.3% at initial measurement at first arrival to 35.4% at measurement three years after.&lt;ref&gt;Heney, Jessica H., Camia C. Dimock, Jennifer F. Friedman, and C. Lewis. "Pediatric refugees in Rhode Island: increases in BMI percentile, overweight, and obesity following resettlement."&amp;nbsp;''RI Med J''&amp;nbsp;98, no. 1 (2015): 43-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

But the nutritional profiles of refugee children also often vary by their country of origin. A study involving Syrian refugee children in Jordanian refugee camps found them to be on average more likely overweight than acutely malnourished. The low prevalence of acute malnutrition among them was attributed, at least partly, to UNICEF's infant and child feeding interventions, as well as to the distribution of food vouchers by the World Food Programme (WFP).&lt;ref&gt;Bilukha, Oleg O., Douglas Jayasekaran, Ann Burton, Gabriele Faender, James King'ori, Mohammad Amiri, Dorte Jessen, and Eva Leidman. "Nutritional Status of Women and Child Refugees from Syria—Jordan, April–May 2014."&amp;nbsp;''MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep''&amp;nbsp;63, no. 29 (2014): 638-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among newly arrived refugees in Washington state, significantly higher rates of obesity were observed among Iraqi children, whereas higher rates of stunting were found among Burmese and Somali children. The latter also had higher rates of wasting.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Such variation in the nutrition profiles of refugee children may be explained by the variance in refugees' location and time in transition.&lt;ref&gt;Yun, Katherine, Jasmine Matheson, Colleen Payton, Kevin C. Scott, Barbara L. Stone, Lihai Song, William M. Stauffer, Kailey Urban, Janine Young, and Blain Mamo. "Health profiles of newly arrived refugee children in the United States, 2006–2012."&amp;nbsp;''American journal of public health''&amp;nbsp;106, no. 1 (2016): 128-135.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Communicable diseases ====
Communicable diseases are a pervasive issue faced by refugee children in camps and other temporary settlements. Governments and organizations are working to address a number of them, such as measles, rubella, diarrhea, and cholera. Refugee children often arrive in the United States from countries with a high prevalence of [[Infectious Disease|infectious disease]].&lt;ref name="Lutfy, Caitlyn 2014"/&gt;

[[Measles]] has been a major cause of child deaths in refugee camps and among [[internally displaced people]]; measles also exacerbates malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;Toole, Michael J., and Ronald J. Waldman. "The public health aspects of complex emergencies and refugee situations."&amp;nbsp;''Annual review of public health''&amp;nbsp;18, no. 1 (1997): 283-312.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toole, Michael J., Richard W. Steketee, Ronald J. Waldman, and Phillip Nieburg. "Measles prevention and control in emergency settings."&amp;nbsp;''Bulletin of the World Health Organization'' 67, no. 4 (1989): 381.&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries, such as Kenya, have developed preventative, detective, and curative programs to specifically target measles within the refugee children population. Kenya has reached over 20 million children with a measles and rubella immunization campaign carried out at the national level in May 2016. In 2017 the Kenya Ministry of Health even reported a routine vaccination coverage of 95 percent in the [[Dadaab refugee camp]]. As of April 2017, in response to the first confirmed cases of measles in the camp, UNICEF and UNHCR have collaborated with the Kenya Ministry of Health to swiftly implement an integrated measles vaccination program in Dadaab. The campaign, which has been targeting children aged six to 14 years, also includes screening, treatment referrals for cases of malnutrition, vitamin A supplementation, and deworming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.unicef.org/kenya/media_20054.html|title=UNICEF Kenya responds to measles outbreak in Dadaab Refugee Camp – Over 61,000 children immunized|last=|first=|date=June 1, 2017|work=UNICEF Kenya|access-date=November 26, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diarrhea, acute watery diarrhea, and [[cholera]] can also put children's lives at risk. Countries, such as Bangladesh, have identified the introduction and development of proper sanitation habits and facilities as potential solutions to these medical conditions. A 2008 study comparing refugee camps in Bangladesh reported that camps with sanitation facilities had cholera rates of 16%, whereas camps without such facilities had cholera rates that were almost three times higher.&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt; In a single week in 2017, 5,011 cases of diarrhea in refugee camps in Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh were reported. In response, UNICEF started a year-long cholera vaccination campaign in October 2017, targeting all children in the camps. At health centers in the refugee camps, UNICEF has been screening for potential cholera cases and providing oral rehydration salts. Community-based health workers are also going around the camps to share information on the risks of acute watery diarrhea, the cholera vaccination campaign, and the importance and necessity of good hygiene practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.unicef.org/blog/preventing-cholera-in-rohingya-refugee-camps/|title=Racing to prevent cholera in Rohingya refugee camps|last=Reilly|first=Hugh|date=October 9, 2017|work=UNICEF|access-date=November 26, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Noncommunicable diseases ====
During all points of the refugee experience, refugee children are often at risk of developing several noncommunicable diseases and conditions, such as lead poisoning, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and pediatric cancer.

Many refugee children come to their host countries with elevated blood lead levels; others encounter lead hazards once they have resettled. A study published in January 2013 found that the blood lead levels of refugee children who had just arrived to the state of New Hampshire were more than twice as likely to be above 10&amp;nbsp;µg/dL as the blood lead levels of children born in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond, Jaime S., Chinaro Kennedy, and Mary Jean Brown. "Blood lead level analysis among refugee children resettled in New Hampshire and Rhode Island."&amp;nbsp;''Public Health Nursing''&amp;nbsp;30, no. 1 (2013): 70-79.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) in the United States also found that nearly 30% of 242 refugee children in New Hampshire developed elevated blood lead levels within three to six months of their arrival to the United States, even though their levels were not found to be elevated at initial screening.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC. "Elevated blood lead levels in refugee children--New Hampshire, 2003-2004."&amp;nbsp;''MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report''&amp;nbsp;54, no. 2 (2005): 42.&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent study reported that refugee children in Massachusetts were 12 times more likely to have blood lead levels over 20&amp;nbsp;µg/dL a year after an initial screening than non-refugee children of the same age and living in the same communities.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, Katherine W., Edwin van Wijngaarden, Susan G. Fisher, Katrina S. Korfmacher, James R. Campbell, I. Diana Fernandez, Jennifer Cochran, and Paul L. Geltman. "Blood lead levels of refugee children resettled in Massachusetts, 2000 to 2007."&amp;nbsp;''American journal of public health''&amp;nbsp;101, no. 1 (2011): 48-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study analyzing the medical records of former refugees residing in Rochester, New York between 1980 and 2012 demonstrated that former child refugees may be at increased risk of [[obesity]], [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]], and [[hypertension]] following resettlement.&lt;ref&gt;Golub, Natalia. "Longitudinal Health Outcomes in Former Refugees." PhD diss., University of Rochester, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Afghan children lack access to urban diagnosis centers in Pakistan; those who do have access have been found to have various types of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Khan, Sher Mohammad, Jawad Gillani, Shagufta Nasreen, and Salar Zai. "Pediatric tumors in north west Pakistan and Afghan refugees."&amp;nbsp;''Pediatric hematology and oncology''&amp;nbsp;14, no. 3 (1997): 267-272.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also estimated that, within Turkey's Syrian refugee population, 60 to 100 children are diagnosed with cancer each year. Overall, the incidence rate of pediatric cancers among Turkey's Syrian refugee population was similar to that of Turkish children. The study additionally noted, however, that most refugee children affected by cancer were diagnosed when the tumor was already at an advanced stage. This could indicate that refugee children and their families often face obstacles such as poor prognoses, language barriers, financial problems, and social problems in adapting to a new setting.&lt;ref&gt;Kebudi, Rejin, Ibrahim Bayram, Begul Yagci-Kupeli, Serhan Kupeli, Gulay Sezgin, Esra Pekpak, Yesim Oymak et al.

==== Mental health and illness ====
Traditionally, the mental health of children experiencing conflict is understood in terms of either post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or toxic stress.&lt;ref&gt;Thabet, A.A. and P. Vostanis, Post-traumatic stress reactions in children of war. J Child Psychol Psychiatry, 1999. 40(3): p. 385-91.&lt;/ref&gt; Prolonged and constant exposure to stress and uncertainty, characteristic of a war environment may result in toxic stress that children express with a change in behavior that may include anxiety, self-harm, aggressiveness or suicide.&lt;ref name="SavetheChildren, Invisible Wounds 2017"&gt;SavetheChildren, Invisible Wounds: The impact of six years of war on the mental health of Syrian children. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 study conducted in Syria by Save the Children determined that 84% of all adults and most children considered ongoing bombing and shelling to be the main psychological stressor, while 89% said that children were more fearful as the war progressed, and 80% said that children had become more aggressive. These stressors are leading causes of the symptoms described above, which lead to diagnosis of PTSD and toxic stress, among other mental conditions. These issues may then be further exacerbated by a forced migration to a foreign country, and the beginning of the process of refugee status determination.&lt;ref name="SavetheChildren, Invisible Wounds 2017"/&gt;

Refugee children are extremely vulnerable during migration and resettlement, and may experience long-term pathological effects, due to "disrupted development time." Psychoanalysts of refugee health have proposed that refugee children experience mourning for their culture and countries, despite the fact that the war-torn state of their homes is unsafe. This sudden loss of familiarity places children at a greater risk for mental dysfunction. In addition, studies have shown that refugee children show a higher vulnerability to stress when separated from their families.&lt;ref name=":27"/&gt; Studies from treatment facilities and small community samples have confirmed that refugee youth are at higher risk for psychopathologic disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, conduct disorder, and problems resulting from substance abuse. However, it is important to note that other large-scale community surveys have found that the rate of psychiatric disorder among immigrant youth is not higher than that of native-born children.&lt;ref&gt;Betancourt, Theresa Stichick, and Kashif Tanveer Khan. "The mental health of children affected by armed conflict: protective processes and pathways to resilience."&amp;nbsp;''International review of psychiatry''&amp;nbsp;20, no. 3 (2008): 317-328.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, Cécile, Aline Drapeau, and Sadeq Rahimi. "The complexity of trauma response: a 4-year follow-up of adolescent Cambodian refugees."&amp;nbsp;''Child abuse &amp; neglect''&amp;nbsp;27, no. 11 (2003): 1277-1290.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, experiments have shown that these adverse outcomes can be prevented through adequate protective factors, such as social support and intimacy.&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;Eisenbruch, Maurice. “The Mental Health of Refugee Children and Their Cultural Development.” ''The International Migration Review'', vol. 22, no. 2, 1988, pp. 282–300. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/2546651.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, effective adaptation strategies, such as absorption in work and creation of pseudofamilies, have led to successful coping in refugees. Many refugee populations, particularly Southeast Asian, undergo a secondary migration to larger communities of kinfolk from their countries of origin, which serve as social support networks for refugees. Research has shown that family reunification, formation of new social groups, community groups, and social services and professional support have contributed to successful resettlement of refugees.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

Refugees can be stigmatized if they encounter mental health deficiencies prior to and during their resettlement into a new society.&lt;ref name="Lustig"/&gt;{{rp|p.14}} Differences between parental and host country [[values]] can create a rift between the refugee child and his/her new society.&lt;ref name="Hyman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hyman|first1=Ilene|last2=Beiser|first2=Morton|last3=Vu|first3=Nhi|year=1996|title=The Mental Health of Refugee Children in Canada|url=http://pi.library.yorku.ca/ojs/index.php/refuge/article/view/21885|journal=Refuge|volume=15|issue=5|pages=4–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p. 5}} Less exposure to stigmatization lowers the risk of refugee children developing PTSD.&lt;ref name="Lustig"/&gt;{{rp|p.14}}

===Access to healthcare===
Cognitive and structural barriers make it difficult to determine the medical service utilization rates and patterns of refugee children. A better understanding of these barriers will help improve mental healthcare access for refugee children and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=December 2009|title=Help-seeking for mental health problems in young refugees: a review of the literature with implications for policy, practice, and research|journal=Transcult Psychiatry|volume=46|issue=4|pages=584–607|doi=10.1177/1363461509351363|pmid=20028678|vauthors=de Anstiss H, Ziaian T, Procter N, Warland J, Baghurst P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cognitive and emotional barriers ====
Many refugees develop a mistrust of authority figures due to repressive governments in their country of origin. Fear of authority and a lack of awareness regarding mental health issues prevent refugee children and their families from seeking medical help.&lt;ref name="McBriden"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/03057925.2010.523168 |title=The importance of context: Vietnamese, Somali, and Iranian refugee mothers discuss their resettled lives and involvement in their children's schools |year=2011 |last1=McBrien |first1=J. Lynn |journal=Compare: A Journal of Comparative and International Education |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=75–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.76}} Certain cultures use informal support systems and self-care strategies to cope with their mental illnesses, rather than rely upon biomedicine.&lt;ref name="Donelly"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.3109/01612840.2010.550383 |title=If I Was Going to Kill Myself, I Wouldn't Be Calling You.

Other factors that delay refugees from seeking medical help are:&lt;ref name="Donelly"/&gt;{{rp|p.284}} 
* Fear of discrimination and stigmatization
* Denial of mental illness as defined in the Western context
* Fear of the unknown consequences following diagnosis such as [[deportation]], separation from family, and losing children
* Mistrust of Western biomedicine

====Language barriers====
A broad spectrum of translation services are available to all refugees, but only a small number of those services are government-sponsored. Community health organizations provide a majority of translation services, but there are a shortage of funds and available programs.&lt;ref name=McKeary&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/jrs/feq038 |title=Barriers to Care: The Challenges for Canadian Refugees and their Health Care Providers |year=2010 |last1=McKeary |first1=Marie |last2=Newbold |first2=Bruce |journal=Journal of Refugee Studies |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=523–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since children and adolescents have a greater capacity to adopt their host country's language and cultural practices, they are often used as [[linguistics|linguistic]] intermediaries between service providers and their parents.&lt;ref name="Hyman"/&gt; This may result in increased tension in family dynamics where culturally sensitive roles are reversed. Traditional family dynamics in refugee families  disturbed by cultural adaptation tend to destabilize important cultural norms, which can create a rift between parent and child. These difficulties cause an increase of depression, anxiety and other mental health concerns in culturally-adapted adolescent refugees.&lt;ref name="Hyman"/&gt;

Relying on other family members or community members has equally problematic results where relatives and community members unintentionally exclude or include details relevant to comprehensive care.&lt;ref name="McKeary"/&gt; Healthcare practitioners are also hesitant to rely on members of the community because it is breaches confidentiality.&lt;ref name="Fowler"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fowler N |title=Providing primary health care to immigrants and refugees: the North Hamilton experience |journal=CMAJ |volume=159 |issue=4 |pages=388–91 |date=August 1998 |pmid=9732723 |pmc=1229607}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.174}} A third party present also reduces the willingness of refugees to trust their healthcare practitioners and disclose information.&lt;ref name="Fowler"/&gt; Patients may receive a different translator for each of their follow-up appointments with their mental healthcare providers, which means that refugees need to recount their story via multiple interpreters, further compromising confidentiality.&lt;ref name="McKeary"/&gt;

====Culturally competent care====
Culturally competent care exists when healthcare providers have received specialized training that helps them to identify the actual and potential cultural factors informing their interactions with refugee patients.&lt;ref name="McKeary"/&gt;{{rp|p.524}} Culturally competent care tends to prioritize the social and cultural determinants contributing to health, but the traditional Western biomedical model of care often fails to acknowledge these determinants.&lt;ref name="McKeary"/&gt;{{rp|p.527}}

To provide culturally competent care to refugees, mental healthcare providers should demonstrate some understanding of the patient's background, and a sensitive commitment to relevant cultural manners (for example: privacy, gender dynamics, religious customs, and lack of language skills).&lt;ref name="McKeary"/&gt;{{rp|p.527}} The willingness of refugees to access mental healthcare services rests on the degree of cultural sensitivity within the structure of their service provider.&lt;ref name="McKeary"/&gt;{{rp|p.528}}

The protective influence exercised by adult refugees on their child and adolescent dependents makes it unlikely that young adult-accompanied refugees will access mental healthcare services. Only 10-30 percent of youth in the general population, with a need for mental healthcare services, are currently accessing care.&lt;ref name="Bean"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bean T, Eurelings-Bontekoe E, Mooijaart A, Spinhoven P |title=Factors associated with mental health service need and utilization among unaccompanied refugee adolescents |journal=Adm Policy Ment Health |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=342–55 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16755395 |doi=10.1007/s10488-006-0046-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.342}} Adolescent ethnic minorities are less likely to access mental healthcare services than youth in the dominant cultural group.

Parents, caretakers and teachers are more likely to report an adolescent's need for help, and seek help resources, than the adolescent.&lt;ref name="Bean"/&gt;{{rp|p.348}} Unaccompanied refugee minors are less likely to access mental healthcare services than their accompanied counterparts. Internalizing complaints (such as depression and anxiety) are prevalent forms of psychological distress among refugee children and adolescents.&lt;ref name="Bean"/&gt;{{rp|p.347}}

====Other obstacles====
Additional structural deterrents for refugees:
* Complicated insurance policies based on refugee status (e.g. Government Assistant Refugees vs. Non-), resulting in hidden costs for refugee patients&lt;ref name="Spitzer"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Health education ===
The World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS) and Family Health International (FHI) have designed and piloted a peer-centered education program for adolescent refugee girls in Uganda, Zambia, and Egypt. The goal of the program was to reach young women who were interested in being informed about reproductive health issues. The program was split into three age-specific groups: girls aged seven to 10 learned about bodily changes and anatomy; girls aged 11 to 14 learned about sexually transmitted diseases; girls aged 15 and older focused on tips to ensure a healthy pregnancy and to properly care for a baby. According to qualitative surveys, increased self-esteem and greater use of health services among the program's participants were the largest benefits of the program.&lt;ref&gt;Speizer, Ilene S., Robert J. Magnani, and Charlotte E. Colvin. "The effectiveness of adolescent reproductive health interventions in developing countries: a review of the evidence."&amp;nbsp;''Journal of Adolescent Health''&amp;nbsp;33, no. 5 (2003): 324-348.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

This section covers education throughout the different stages of the refugee experience. The report, "Left Behind: Refugee Education in Crisis," compares [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]] sources and statistics on refugee education with data on school enrollment around the world provided by [[UNESCO]], the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. The report notes that, globally, 91 percent of children attend primary school. For all refugees, that figure is at 61 percent. Specifically in low-income countries, less than 50 percent of refugees are able to attend primary school. As refugee children get older, school enrollment rates drop: only 23 percent of refugee adolescents are enrolled in secondary school, versus the global figure of 84 percent. In low-income countries, nine percent of refugees are able to go to secondary school. Across the world, enrollment in tertiary education stands at 36 percent. For refugees, the percentage remains at one percent.&lt;ref&gt;“Left Behind: Refugee Education in Crisis.” Geneva, Switzerland: UNHCR, September 12, 2017. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.unhcr.org/59b696f44.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adapting to a new school environment is a major undertaking for refugee children who arrive in a new country or [[refugee camp]].&lt;ref name="Hoot"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.03.363 |title=Working with very young refugee children in our schools: Implications for the world's teachers |year=2011 |last1=Hoot |first1=James L. |journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences |volume=15 |pages=1751–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Education is crucial for the sufficient psychosocial adjustment and cognitive growth of refugee children.&lt;ref name="Eisenbruch" /&gt; Due to these circumstances, it is important that educators consider the needs, obstacles, and successful educational pathways for children refugees.&lt;ref name="Bridging Refugee Youth and Children's Services"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Educational Handbook for Refugee Parents|last=Bridging Refugee Youth and Children's Services.|publisher=International Rescue Committee: New York|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham, Minhas, and Paxton (2016) note in their study that&amp;nbsp;parents' misunderstandings about educational styles, teachers' low expectations and stereotyping tendencies, bullying and racial discrimination, pre-migration and post-migration trauma, and forced detention can all be risk factors for learning problems in refugee children. They also note that high academic and life ambition, parents' involvement in education, a supportive home and school environment, teachers' understanding of linguistic and cultural heritage, and healthy peer relationships can all contribute to a refugee child's success in school.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Hamish R., Ripudaman S. Minhas, and Georgia Paxton. "Learning problems in children of refugee background: a systematic review."&amp;nbsp;''Pediatrics''&amp;nbsp;137, no. 6 (2016): e20153994.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access to education===

====Structure of the education system====
Schools in North America lack the necessary resources for supporting refugee children, particularly in negotiating their academic experience and in addressing the diverse learning needs of refugee children.&lt;ref name=ISIK-ERCAN&gt;{{cite journal|last=Isik-Ercan|first=Zeynep|title=In Pursuit of a New Perspective in the Education of Children of the Refugees: Advocacy for the Family|journal=Educational Sciences: Theory &amp; Practice|date=Autumn 2012|issue=Special Issue|pages=3025–8|url=https://www.academia.edu/2329285/In_Pursuit_of_a_New_Perspective_in_the_Education_of_Children_of_the_Refugees_Advocacy_for_the_Family_|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complex schooling policies that vary by classroom, building and district, and procedures that require written communication or parent involvement intimidate the parents of refugee children.&lt;ref name=ISIK-ERCAN /&gt; Educators in North America typically guess the grade in which refugee children should be placed because there is not a standard test or formal interview process required of refugee children.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt;{{rp|p.189}}

[[File:The Sahrawi refugees – a forgotten crisis in the Algerian desert (5).jpg|thumb|[[Sahrawi people|Sahrawi]] refugee children learning Arabic and Spanish, math, reading and writing, and science subjects.]]
The ability to enroll in school and continue one's studies in [[developing country|developing countries]] is limited and uneven across regions and settings of displacement, particularly for young girls and at the secondary levels.&lt;ref name=Dryden-Peterson&gt;{{cite book|last=Dryden-Peterson|first=Sarah|title=Refugee Education: A Global Review|year=2011|publisher=UNHCR|location=University of Toronto|url=http://www.unhcr.org/4fe317589.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The availability of sufficient classrooms and teachers is low and many discriminatory policies and practices prohibit refugee children from attending school.&lt;ref name="Dryden-Peterson" /&gt; Educational policies promoting age-caps can also be harmful to refugee children.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/13676260220134430 |title=Factors Influencing the Academic Success of Refugee Youth in Canada |year=2002 |last1=Wilkinson |first1=Lori |journal=Journal of Youth Studies |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=173–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.176}}

Many refugee children face legal restrictions to schooling, even in countries of first asylum.&amp;nbsp;This is the case especially for countries that have not signed the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|1951 Refugee Convention]] or its [[Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees|1967 Protocol]].&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;Dryden-Peterson, Sarah. "Refugee education in countries of first asylum: Breaking open the black box of pre-resettlement experiences."&amp;nbsp;''Theory and Research in Education''&amp;nbsp;14, no. 2 (2016): 131-148.&lt;/ref&gt; In countries where they lack official refugee status, refugee children are unable to enroll in national schools.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;Dryden-Peterson, Sarah. "The educational experiences of refugee children in countries of first asylum."&amp;nbsp;''Migration Policy Institute''&amp;nbsp;(2015).&lt;/ref&gt; In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, unregistered refugee children described being hesitant to go to school, due to risk of encountering legal authorities at school or while on the way to and from school.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

==== Structure of classes ====
Student-teacher ratios are very high in most refugee schools, and in some countries, these ratios are nearly twice the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|UNCHR]] guideline of 40:1.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Although global policies and standards for refugee settings endorse child-centered teaching methods that promote student participation,&lt;ref&gt;Dryden-Peterson, Sarah.&amp;nbsp;''Refugee education: A global review''. UNCHR, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; teacher-centered instruction often predominates in refugee classrooms. Teachers lecture for the majority of the time, offering few opportunities for students to ask questions or engage in creative thinking.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; In eight refugee-serving schools in Kenya, for example, lecturing was the primary mode of instruction.&lt;ref&gt;Mendenhall, Mary, Sarah Dryden-Peterson, Lesley Bartlett, Caroline Ndirangu, Rosemary Imonje, Daniel Gakunga, and M. Tangelder. "Quality education for refugees in Kenya: Pedagogy in urban Nairobi and Kakuma refugee camp settings."&amp;nbsp;''Journal on Education in Emergencies''&amp;nbsp;1, no. 1 (2015): 92-130.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Residence====
Refugee children who live in large [[urban area|urban]] centers in North America have a higher rate of success at school, particularly because their families have greater access to additional social services that can help address their specific needs.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt;{{rp|p.190}} Families who are unable to move to urban centers are at a disadvantage.

====Language barriers and ethnicity====
[[Acculturation]] stress occurs in North America when families expect refugee youth to remain loyal to ethnic values while mastering the host [[culture]] in school and social activities. In response to this demand, children may over-identify with their host culture, their culture of origin, or become marginalized from both.&lt;ref name=Correa-Velez&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Correa-Velez I, Gifford SM, Barnett AG |title=Longing to belong: social inclusion and wellbeing among youth with refugee backgrounds in the first three years in Melbourne, Australia |journal=Soc Sci Med |volume=71 |issue=8 |pages=1399–408 |date=October 2010 |pmid=20822841 |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.07.018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Insufficient communication due to [[language barrier|language]] and cultural barriers may evoke a sense of alienation or "being the other" in a new society. The clash between cultural values of the family and popular culture in mainstream Western society leads to the alienation of refugee children from their home culture.&lt;ref name=ISIK-ERCAN /&gt;

Many Western schools do not address diversity among ethnic groups from the same nation or provide resources for specific needs of different cultures (such as including [[halal]] food in the school menu). Without successfully negotiating cultural differences in the classroom, refugee children experience [[social exclusion]] in their new host culture.&lt;ref name=ISIK-ERCAN /&gt;  The presence of racial and ethnic discrimination can have an adverse effect on the well-being of certain groups of children and lead to a reduction in their overall school performance.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt;{{rp|p.189}} For instance, cultural differences place Vietnamese refugee youth at a higher risk of pursuing disruptive behaviour.&lt;ref name="Zhou, M &amp; Bankston, Carl"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED439180|title=Straddling Two Social Worlds: The Experience of Vietnamese Refugee Children in the U.S.|author1=Zhou, M|author2=Bankston, Carl.|publisher=Education Resources Information Center, 111, pp. 1-84|year=2000|lastauthoramp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.7}} Contemporary [[Vietnamese American]] adolescents are prone to greater uncertainties, self-doubts and emotional difficulties than other American adolescents. Vietnamese children are less likely to say they have much to be proud of, that they like themselves as they are, that they have many good qualities, and that they feel socially accepted.&lt;ref name="Zhou, M &amp; Bankston, Carl" /&gt;{{rp|p.11}}

Classes for refugees, more often than not, are taught in the host-country language.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Refugees in the same classroom may also speak several different languages, requiring multiple interpretations; this can slow the pace of overall instruction.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo living in Uganda, for example, had to transition from French to English. Some of these children were placed in lower-level classes due to their lack of English proficiency. Many older children therefore had to repeat lower-level classes, even if they had already mastered the content.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Using the language of one ethnic group as the instructional language may threaten the identity of a minority group.&lt;ref&gt;Pherali, Tejendra, and Dean Garratt. "Post-conflict identity crisis in Nepal: Implications for educational reforms."&amp;nbsp;''International Journal of Educational Development''&amp;nbsp;34 (2014): 42-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The content of the curriculum can also act as a form of discrimination against refugee children involved in the education systems of first asylum countries.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;Bush, Kenneth David, and Diana Saltarelli. "The two faces of education in ethnic conflict." (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Curricula often seem foreign and difficult to understand to refugees who are attending national schools alongside host-country nationals. For instance, in Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya, children described having a hard time understanding concepts that lacked relevance to their lived experiences, especially concepts related to Kenyan history and geography.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Similarly, in Uganda, refugee children from the Democratic Republic of Congo studying together with Ugandan children in government schools did not have opportunities in the curriculum to learn the history of their home country.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The teaching of one-sided narratives, such as during history lessons, can also threaten the identity of students belonging to minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO.&amp;nbsp;''The hidden crisis: Armed conflict and education''. UNESCO, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Flickr - Government Press Office (GPO) - Vietnamese mothers bringing their children to the Wizo kindergarten in upper Afula.jpg|thumb|[[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] refugee mother and children at a kindergarten in upper [[Afula]], 1979.]]

====Other obstacles====
Although high-quality education helps refugee children feel safe in the present and enable them to be productive in the future, some do not find success in school.&lt;ref name="Stewart"&gt;{{Cite book
| last = Stewart
| first = Jan
| title = Supporting Refugee Children: Strategies for Educators
| publisher = University of Toronto Press: Toronto
| year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.67}} Other obstacles may include:&lt;ref name="McBriden" /&gt;
*Disrupted schooling - refugee children may experience disruptive schooling in their country of origin, or they may receive no form of education at all. It is extremely difficult for a student with no previous education to enter a school full of educated children.&lt;ref name="Stewart" /&gt;{{rp|p.71}}
* Trauma - can impede the ability to learn and cause fear of people in positions of authority (such as teachers and principals)&lt;ref name="McBriden" /&gt;{{rp|p.340}}
* School drop outs - due to self-perceptions of academic ability, antisocial behaviour, rejection from peers and/or a lack of educational preparation prior to entering the host-country school. School drop outs may also be caused by unsafe school conditions, poverty, etc.&lt;ref name="McBriden" /&gt;{{rp|p.341}}
* Parents - when parental involvement and support are lacking, a child's academic success decreases substantially. Refugee parents are often unable to help their children with homework due to language barriers. Parents often do not understand the concept of parent-teacher meetings and/or never expect to be a part of their child's education due to pre-existing cultural beliefs.  
* Assimilation - a refugee child's attempt to quickly [[Cultural assimilation|assimilate]] into the culture of their school can cause alienation from their parents and country of origin and create barriers and tension between the parent and child.&lt;ref name="McBriden" /&gt;{{rp|p.340–344}}
* Social and individual rejection - hostile discrimination can cause additional trauma when refugee children and treated cruelly by their peers&lt;ref name="McBriden" /&gt;{{rp|p.350}}
* Identity confusion&lt;ref name="McBriden" /&gt;{{rp|p.352}}
* Behavioral issues - caused by the adjustment issues and survival behaviours learned in refugee camps&lt;ref name="McBriden" /&gt;{{rp|p.355}}

===Role of teachers===
North American schools are agents of acculturation, helping refugee children integrate into Western [[society]].&lt;ref name="Eisenbruch"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Maurice |last1=Eisenbruch |year=1988 |title=The Mental Health of Refugee Children and Their Cultural Development |journal=International Migration Review |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=282–300 |jstor=2546651 |doi=10.2307/2546651}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.291}} Successful educators help children process trauma they may have experienced in their country of origin while supporting their academic adjustment.&lt;ref name="Szente"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10643-006-0082-2 |title=Responding to the Special Needs of Refugee Children: Practical Ideas for Teachers |year=2006 |last1=Szente |first1=Judit |last2=Hoot |first2=James |last3=Taylor |first3=Dorothy |journal=Early Childhood Education Journal |volume=34 |pages=15–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Refugee children benefit from established and encouraged communication between student and teacher, and also between different students in the classroom.&lt;ref name="Szente" /&gt; Familiarity with sign language and basic [[English as a second or foreign language|ESL]] strategies improves communication between teachers and refugee children.&lt;ref name="Hoot" /&gt; Also, non-refugee peers need access to literature that helps educate them on their refugee classmates experiences.&lt;ref name="Szente" /&gt;  Course materials should be appropriate for the specific learning needs of refugee children and provide for a wide range of skills in order to give refugee children strong academic support.&lt;ref name="Hoot" /&gt;

Educators should spend time with refugee families discussing previous experiences of the child in order to place the refugee child in the correct grade level and to provide any necessary accommodations&lt;ref name="Wilkinson" /&gt;{{rp|p.189}} School policies, expectations, and parent's rights should be translated into the parent's native language since many parents do not speak English proficiently. Educators need to understand the multiple demands placed on parents (such as work and family care) and be prepared to offer flexibility in meeting times with these families.&lt;ref name="Hoot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ISIK-ERCAN" /&gt;

====Academic adjustment of refugee children====
[[File:Syrian refugee children.jpg|thumb|Syrian refugee children attend a lesson in a UNICEF temporary classroom in northern Lebanon, July 2014]]
Teachers can make the transition to a new school easier for refugee children by providing [[Language interpretation|interpreters]].&lt;ref name="Szente" /&gt; Schools meet the psychosocial needs of children affected by war or displacement through programs that provide children with avenues for emotional expression, personal support, and opportunities to enhance their understanding of their past experience.&lt;ref name="Roussea, Cecile &amp; Guzder, Jaswant"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rousseau C, Guzder J |title=School-based prevention programs for refugee children |journal=Child Adolesc Psychiatr Clin N Am |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=533–49, viii |date=July 2008 |pmid=18558311 |doi=10.1016/j.chc.2008.02.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.536}} Refugee children benefit from a case-by-case approach to learning, because every child has had a different experience during their resettlement. Communities where the refugee populations are bigger should work with the schools to initiate after school, summer school, or weekend clubs that give the children more opportunities to adjust to their new educational setting.&lt;ref name="Szente" /&gt;

[[Biculturalism|Bicultural]] integration is the most effective mode of acculturation for refugee adolescents in North America. The staff of the school must understand students in a community context and respect cultural differences.&lt;ref name="McBriden" /&gt;{{rp|p.331}} Parental support, refugee peer support, and welcoming refugee youth centers are successful in keeping refugee children in school for longer periods of time.&lt;ref name="McBriden" /&gt;{{rp|p.334}} Education about the refugee experience in North America also helps teachers relate better with refugee children and understand the traumas and issues a refugee child may have experienced.&lt;ref name="McBriden" /&gt;{{rp|p.333}}

Refugee children thrive in classroom environments where all students are valued. A sense of belonging, as well as ability to flourish and become part of the new host society, are factors predicting the well-being of refugee children in academics.&lt;ref name="Correa-Velez" /&gt; Increased school involvement and social interaction with other students help refugee children combat [[depression (mood)|depression]] and/or other underlying [[mental health]] concerns that emerge during the post-migration period.&lt;ref name="Kia-Keating"&gt;{{cite journal|date=January 2007|title=Belonging and connection to school in resettlement: young refugees, school belonging, and psychosocial adjustment|journal=Clin Child Psychol Psychiatry|volume=12|issue=1|pages=29–43|doi=10.1177/1359104507071052|pmid=17375808|vauthors=Kia-Keating M, Ellis BH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Peace education ===
Implemented by UNICEF from 2012 to 2016 and funded by the Government of the Netherlands, Peacebuilding, Education, and Advocacy (PBEA) was a program that tested innovative education solutions to achieve peacebuilding results.&lt;ref&gt;Affolter, Friedrich W. "Indicators for Education for Peacebuilding in Fragile States UNICEF’s Peacebuilding, Education and Advocacy Program."&lt;/ref&gt; The PBEA program in Kenya's [[Dadaab refugee camp]] aimed to strengthen resilience and social cohesion in the camp, as well as between refugees and the host community.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; The initiative was composed of two parts: the Peace Education Programme (PEP), an in-school program taught in Dadaab's primary schools, and the Sports for Development and Peace (SDP) program for refugee adolescents and youth. There was anecdotal evidence of increased levels of social cohesion from participation in PEP and potential resilience from participation in SDP.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

Peace education for refugee children may also have limitations and its share of opponents. Although [[peace education]] from past programs involving non-refugee populations reported to have had positive effects,&lt;ref&gt;Arnon, Michal, and Yair Galily. "Monitoring the effects of an education for peace program: An Israeli perspective."&amp;nbsp;''Human Affairs''&amp;nbsp;24, no. 4 (2014): 531-544.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Gal. "Is there a place for peace education? Political education and citizenship activism in Israeli schools."&amp;nbsp;''Journal of Peace Education''&amp;nbsp;11, no. 1 (2014): 101-119.&lt;/ref&gt; studies have found that the attitudes of parents and teachers can also have a strong influence on students' internalization of peace values.&lt;ref&gt;Yahya, Siham, Zvi Bekerman, Shifra Sagy, and Simon Boag. "When education meets conflict: Palestinian and Jewish-Israeli parental attitudes towards peace promoting education."&amp;nbsp;''Journal of Peace Education''&amp;nbsp;9, no. 3 (2012): 297-320.&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers from [[Cyprus]] also resisted a [[peace education]] program initiated by the government.&lt;ref&gt;Zembylas, Michalinos, Panayiota Charalambous, and Constadina Charalambous. "Manifestations of Greek-Cypriot teachers' discomfort toward a peace education initiative: Engaging with discomfort pedagogically."&amp;nbsp;''Teaching and Teacher Education''&amp;nbsp;28, no. 8 (2012): 1071-1082.&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that, while teachers supported the prospect of reconciliation, ideological and practical concerns made them uncertain about the effective implementation of a peace education program.&lt;ref&gt;Zembylas, Michalinos, Constadina Charalambous, Panayiota Charalambous, and Panayiota Kendeou. "Promoting peaceful coexistence in conflict-ridden Cyprus: Teachers’ difficulties and emotions towards a new policy initiative."&amp;nbsp;''Teaching and Teacher Education''&amp;nbsp;27, no. 2 (2011): 332-341.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disabilities ==
Children with disabilities frequently suffer physical and sexual abuse, exploitation, and neglect. They are often not only excluded from education, but also not provided the necessary supports for realizing and reaching their full potential.

In refugee camps and temporary shelters, the needs of children with disabilities are often overlooked. In particular, a study surveying Bhutanese refugee camps in Nepal, Burmese refugee camps in Thailand, Somali refugee camps in Yemen, the [[Dadaab refugee camp]] for Somali refugees in Kenya, and camps for internally displaced persons in Sudan and Sri Lanka, found that many mainstream services failed to adequately cater to the specific needs of children with disabilities. The study reported that mothers in Nepal and Yemen have been unable to receive formulated food for children with cerebral palsy and cleft palates. The same study also found that, although children with disabilities were attending school in all surveyed countries, and refugee camps in Nepal and Thailand have successful programs that integrate children with disabilities into schools, all other surveyed countries have failed to encourage children with disabilities to attend school.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;Reilly, Rachael. "Disabilities among refugees and conflict-affected populations."&amp;nbsp;''Forced Migration Review''&amp;nbsp;35 (2010): 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Syrian parents consulted during a four-week field assessment conducted in northern and eastern [[Lebanon]] in March 2013 reported that, since arriving in Lebanon, their children with disabilities had not been attending school or engaging in other educational activities.&lt;ref&gt;“Disability Inclusion in the Syrian Refugee Response in Lebanon.” New York: Women’s Refugee Commission, July 2013. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Disability_Inclusion_in_the_Syrian_Refugee_Response_in_Lebanon.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In Jordan, too, Syrian refugee children with disabilities identified lack of specialist educational care and physical inaccessibility as the main barriers to their education.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF. "Access to Education for Syrian Refugee Children and Youth in Jordan Host Communities."&amp;nbsp;''UNICEF, Jordan'' (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, limited attention is being given to refugee children with disabilities in the United Kingdom. It was reported in February 2017 that its government has decided to partially suspend the Vulnerable Children's Resettlement Scheme, originally set to resettle 3,000 children with their families from countries in the Middle East and North Africa. As a result of this suspension, no youth with complex needs, including those with disabilities and learning difficulties,&amp;nbsp;would be accepted into the program until further notice.&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt;

Countries may often overlook refugee children with disabilities with regards to humanitarian aid, because data on refugee children with disabilities are limited. Roberts and Harris (1990) note that there is insufficient statistical and empirical information on disabled refugees in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Keri, and Jennifer Harris.&amp;nbsp;''Disabled refugees and asylum seekers in Britain: Numbers and social characteristics''. University of York, Social Policy Research Unit, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; While it was reported in 2013 that 26 percent of all Syrian refugees in Jordan had impaired physical, intellectual, or sensory abilities, such data specifically for children do not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/handicapinternational/pages/454/attachments/original/1397045203/Hidden_Victims_of_the_Syrian_Crisis%E2%80%94disabled__injured_and_older_refugees.pdf?1397045203|title=Hidden victims of the Syrian crisis: disabled, injured and older refugees|last=|first=|date=2014|website=Handicap International, HelpAge International|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sex]] and the use of [[drug]]s (legal and illegal) have been linked throughout human history, encompassing all aspects of sex: [[desire]], [[performance improvement|performance]], [[pleasure]], [[fertilisation|conception]], [[gestation]], and [[disease]].

== Disinhibition ==
Drugs are frequently associated with reduced sexual inhibition, both when used voluntarily in social circumstances, and involuntarily, as in the case of some [[date rape drug]]s.

Because the use of drugs, including [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], is commonly presented as an excuse for risky or socially unacceptable behaviour, it is necessary to treat the idea of a direct causal relation between drug use and [[unsafe sex]] with caution.  Drugs may provide a socially acceptable excuse for engaging in sexual behaviours in which people may want to engage but perhaps feel that they should not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Race|first1=Kane|title=Pleasure Consuming Medicine: The Queer Politics of Drugs|date=2009|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0822390884|page=176|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PkVuU9KmotYC&amp;&amp;pg=PA176|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexual function ==
Some forms of sexual dysfunction such as [[erectile dysfunction]] can be treated with drugs. Because of their effects, erectile dysfunction drugs are sometimes used for recreational purposes.

Many [[drug]]s, both legal and illegal, some sold online, have side effects that affect the user's sexual function. Many drugs can cause [[loss of libido]] as a side effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoffman|first1=JR|last2=Ratamess|first2=NA|title=Medical issues associated with anabolic steroid use: are they exaggerated?|journal=Journal of sports science &amp; medicine|date=2006|volume=5|issue=2|pages=182-93|pmid=24259990|pmc=3827559}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url= https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-male-enhancement-products-deliver-more-you-bargained-f1C8993189 | title = FDA: ‘Male enhancement’ products deliver more than you bargained for | publisher = NBC News | date  = 21 March 2013| accessdate = January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the partial cause of the [[Refractory period (sex)|refractory period]] is the inhibition of [[dopamine]] by an orgasm-induced [[secretion]] of [[prolactin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Krüger TH, Haake P, Haverkamp J, etal | title = Effects of acute prolactin manipulation on sexual drive and function in males | journal = [[Journal of Endocrinology]] | volume = 179 | issue = 3 | pages = 357–65 |date=December 2003 | pmid = 14656205 | doi = 10.1677/joe.0.1790357 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such potent [[dopamine receptor]] [[agonist]]s as [[cabergoline]] may help achieve multiple [[orgasm]]s as well as the retention of sexual arousal for longer periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krüger TH, Haake P, Haverkamp J, etal | title = Effects of acute prolactin manipulation on sexual drive and function in males | journal = [[Journal of Endocrinology]] | volume = 179 | issue = 3 | pages = 357–65 |date=December 2003 | pmid = 14656205 | doi = 10.1677/joe.0.1790357 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contraception and abortion == 
Drug-based contraception has been available since the development of the [[contraceptive pill]]. As well as their contraceptive effects, contraceptive drugs can also have adverse sexual and reproductive side-effects. Prior to the availability of effective contraceptives, some substances were also used as [[abortifacient]]s to terminate pregnancy; [[medical abortion]] exists as a modern medical practice.

A '''special needs plan''' (or SNP, often pronounced "snip") is a category of the US [[Medicare Advantage]] plan designed to attract and enroll Medicare beneficiaries who fall into a certain special needs demographic.  There are two types of SNPs.  The exclusive SNP enrolls only those beneficiaries who fall into the special needs demographic.  The other type is the disproportionate share SNP.  "Disproportionate share" SNPs enroll a greater percentage of the target special needs population as compared to a national percentage of the target population. Under the federal �[[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act]] of 2003, Congress identified special needs individuals" as (1) institutionalized, or (2) [[Medicare dual eligible|dually eligible]], or (3) individuals with severe or disabling chronic conditions. More specifically, special needs individuals include:

*'''Institutionalized beneficiaries''', defined as those who reside or are expected to reside for 90 days or longer in a long term care facility (defined as either: skilled nursing facility (SNF)/NF, ICF or inpatient psychiatric facility), or those living in the community but requiring an equivalent level of care to those residing in a long term care facility.
*'''Dually eligible beneficiaries''', defined as individuals who are entitled to [[Medicare (United States)#Part A: Hospital.2FHospice insurance|Medicare Part A]] and/or Part B and are eligible for some form of [[Medicaid]] benefit.
*'''Beneficiaries with chronic conditions''', defined as individuals who have acquired one or more disabling chronic conditions, including, but not limited to: [[cardiovascular disease]], [[diabetes]], [[congestive heart failure]], [[osteoarthritis]], [[mental disorders]], [[Chronic kidney disease|ESRD]], and [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21402">'''Symptom targeted intervention''' (STI) is a clinical program being used in medical settings to help patients who struggle with symptoms of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] or [[anxiety]] or [[Compliance (medicine)|adherence]] to treatment plans but who are not interested in receiving outpatient [[mental health]] treatment. STI is an individualized therapeutic model and clinical program that teaches patients brief, effective ways to cope with difficult thoughts, feelings, and behaviors using evidence-based interventions. Its individualized engagement process employs techniques from [[Solution focused brief therapy|solution-focused therapy]], using a [[Carl Rogers|Rogerian]], patient-centered philosophy. This engagement process ensures that even challenging, at-risk, and non-adherent patients are able to participate.

[[Social worker]]s and other [[mental health professional|mental health practitioner]]s and medical professionals use STI to assist patients with a number of specific concerns, from [[Sleep disorder|sleep]] and [[Psychological stress|stress]] to [[pain management]], relationships and mood management. STI’s coping tools are [[cognitive-behavioral|cognitive behavioral therapy]] and [[mindfulness]] interventions that have been condensed and modified to make them user friendly and effective in brief sessions. After meeting with the clinician, the patient takes charge, performing interventions at home through assignments that extend and reinforce learning.

Using STI, the clinician helps the patient identify the most problematic symptom of the depression (such as depressed mood, [[insomnia]], anxiety, [[rumination (psychology)|rumination]], [[irritability]], [[negative thinking]], [[social isolation]]), then together the clinician and patient address that symptom using STI’s evidence-based selection of brief [[cognitive therapy|cognitive]], [[behavioral therapy|behavioral]], and [[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] techniques. The emphasis is on keeping interactions brief since mental health treatment in the [[primary care]] setting is typically time limited&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2008.04.001 |title=Psychological interventions for major depression in primary care: A meta-analytic review of randomized controlled trials |year=2008 |last1=Bortolotti |first1=Biancamaria |last2=Menchetti |first2=Marco |last3=Bellini |first3=Francesca |last4=Montaguti |first4=Milena Barbara |last5=Berardi |first5=Domenico |journal=General Hospital Psychiatry |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=293–302 |pmid=18585531}}&lt;/ref&gt;—although the [[Collaborative Care]] and [[Integrated care|Integrated Care]] models provides hope for improved and expanded mental health services in the primary care setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.289.23.3145 |title=Educational and Organizational Interventions to Improve the Management of Depression in Primary Care: A Systematic Review |year=2003 |last1=Gilbody |first1=S. |journal=JAMA |volume=289 |issue=23 |pages=3145–51 |pmid=12813120 |last2=Whitty |first2=P |last3=Grimshaw |first3=J |last4=Thomas |first4=R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As patients learn better coping skills, they become more engaged with their treatment and more [[Compliance (medicine)|adherent]] to doctors’ recommendations.

STI also gives [[social worker]]s ways to uncover their clinical strengths and tools to continue to work with resistant patients. With STI training, clinicians learn a nuanced approach to all patients, even those who resist help, since often those are the individuals who need help most. After learning STI, clinicians report that they are more likely to approach rather than avoid difficult patient situations.

==Origins==
[[File:Melissa McCool.png|thumb|Melissa McCool, creator of STI]]
STI was created in 2009 by [[LCSW|licensed clinical social worker (LCSW)]] [[Melissa McCool]] to give clinicians a toolkit for helping depressed patients who cannot or will not seek [[outpatient]] [[psychotherapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17168058 |year=2006 |last1=Roberts |first1=J |last2=Johnstone |first2=S |title=Screening and treating depression: Patient preferences and implications for social workers |volume=20 |issue=13 |pages=43, 47–9 |journal=Nephrology News &amp; Issues}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCool originally developed STI for patients with [[chronic kidney disease|end-stage renal disease (ESRD)]]. Patients with ESRD and other chronic diseases often suffer from depression&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ki.2008.222 |title=Depression and end-stage renal disease: A therapeutic challenge |year=2008 |last1=Finkelstein |first1=Fredric O |last2=Wuerth |first2=Diane |last3=Troidle |first3=Laura K |last4=Finkelstein |first4=Susan H |journal=Kidney International |volume=74 |issue=7 |pages=843–5 |pmid=18794813}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it often goes undiagnosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0022-3999(02)00310-0 |title=Depression in patients with chronic renal disease |year=2002 |last1=Kimmel |first1=Paul L |journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research |volume=53 |issue=4 |pages=951–6 |pmid=12377308}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies suggest that at least 25% of [[dialysis]] patients have clinical depression and at least 35% have symptoms that put them at risk for depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2215/CJN.00030505 |title=Temporal Relation among Depression Symptoms, Cardiovascular Disease Events, and Mortality in End-Stage Renal Disease: Contribution of Reverse Causality |year=2006 |last1=Boulware |first1=L.

New York: Springer Publishing Company. {{ISBN|978-0-8261-1942-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intellectual premise for STI is based on [[systems psychology|systems theory]], which considers a system as a set of interacting and independent parts. If depression is a system consisting of various symptoms, when one of the symptoms improves, the entire trajectory of the depressive episode is transformed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.66.6.939 |title=Dynamic systems theory as a paradigm for the study of change in psychotherapy: An application to cognitive therapy for depression |year=1998 |last1=Hayes |first1=Adele M. |last2=Strauss |first2=Jennifer L. |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=66 |issue=6 |pages=939–47 |pmid=9874907}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, STI is related to [[Murray Bowen|Bowen’s]] [[systemic therapy|systemic theory]] and its interactional dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dallos |first1=R |last2=Draper |first2=R |year=2010 |title= [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6427.2007.00371_2.x/abstract An introduction to family therapy: systemic theory and practice] |page=34 |publisher=Open University Press |isbn=978-0-335-23801-9|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6427.2007.00371_2.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using STI, the patient and clinician focus on one element, or symptom, helping the patient avoid feeling overwhelmed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0005-7967(01)00098-5 |title=Rumination and social problem-solving in depression |year=2002 |last1=Watkins |first1=Ed |last2=Baracaia |first2=Simona |journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy |volume=40 |issue=10 |pages=1179–89 |pmid=12375726}}&lt;/ref&gt; by multiple problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0033291707002206 |title=Experimental evidence for a motivational origin of cognitive impairment in major depression |year=2007 |last1=Scheurich |first1=A. |last2=Fellgiebel |first2=A. |last3=Schermuly |first3=I. |last4=Bauer |first4=S. |last5=Wölfges |first5=R. |last6=Müller |first6=M.

Also central to STI is the cognitive triangle, which illustrates how one’s thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all interconnected and dependent upon one another. If a behavior changes, thoughts and feelings change; if a thought changes, behaviors and feelings change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beck |first1=JS |year=1995 |title= [http://www.beckinstitute.org/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-books Cognitive therapy: Basics and beyond] |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=978-0-89862-847-0}}{{page needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

STI has been expanded beyond ESRD to support the many patients who are suffering from depression who receive treatment for chronic disease in outpatient clinics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=10512600 |year=1999 |last1=McQuaid |first1=JR |last2=Stein |first2=MB |last3=Laffaye |first3=C |last4=McCahill |first4=ME |title=Depression in a primary care clinic: The prevalence and impact of an unrecognized disorder |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |doi=10.1016/S0165-0327(98)00191-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; hospitals, nursing homes or rehabilitation centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9141645 |year=1997 |last1=Zheng |first1=D |last2=MacEra |first2=CA |last3=Croft |first3=JB |last4=Giles |first4=WH |last5=Davis |first5=D |last6=Scott |first6=WK |title=Major depression and all-cause mortality among white adults in the United States |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=213–8 |journal=Annals of Epidemiology |doi=10.1016/S1047-2797(97)00014-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kaiser Permanente]] is now using STI as the main treatment modality in its Collaborative Care study.&lt;ref&gt;Johnstone, Stephanie (2013).

==Impact==
A review of treatments for anxiety and depression in dialysis patients cited STI as an economical way to alleviate depression using brief, in-clinic sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Feroze Usama |author2=Martin David |author3=Kalantar-Zadeh Kamyar |author4=Kim Jun Chul |author5=Reina-Patton Astrid |author6=Kopple Joel D | year = 2012 | title = Anxiety and depression in maintenance dialysis patients: Preliminary data of a cross-sectional study and brief literature review | url = http://www.jrnjournal.org/article/S1051-2276%2811%2900199-3/abstract | journal = Journal of Renal Nutrition | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 207–10 | doi = 10.1053/j.jrn.2011.10.009 |pmid=22200444 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A review that considered measures of quality of life in patients with ESRD noted that STI’s techniques are promising and productive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Naik Nimish |author2=Hess Rachel |author3=Unruh Mark | year = 2012 | title = Measurement of health-related quality of life in the care of patients with ESRD: Isn't this the metric that matters? | journal = Seminars in Dialysis | volume = 25 | issue = 4| pages = 439–44 | doi = 10.1111/j.1525-139X.2012.01110.x |pmid=22809006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; STI was included in a 2013 review of best practices for effective screening and managing depression in dialysis patients.&lt;ref&gt;Erdley, Shiloh D. (2013) [http://repository.upenn.edu/edissertations_sp2/33 "Problem-solving therapy for depressed older hemodialysis patients: A pilot randomized trial".] ''Doctorate in Social Work (DSW) Dissertations'' Paper 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 article about ways that social workers can ease chronically ill patients’ burdens and effectively address their emotional challenges, Joseph R. Merighi, PhD, MSW, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota School of Social Work, describes STI as “an innovative, brief, and patient-centered approach that modifies cognitive, behavioral, and mindfulness techniques to make them user-friendly for patients and brief in their delivery.” The article’s author adds that STI is “used by the leading dialysis providers and has become the standard of care.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jackson Kate | year = 2014 | title = Nephrology Social Work: Caring for the Emotional Needs of Dialysis Patients | url = http://www.socialworktoday.com/archive/091514p20.shtml | journal = Social Work Today | volume = 14 | issue = 5| page = 20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

STI is now being used by medical social workers in a range of settings across the United States, who have reported positive results.&lt;ref&gt;Scotto, Pandora (2012) "Symptom Targeted Intervention: a worthwhile venture for both patient and social worker," ''RenaLink''.&lt;/ref&gt; To teach social workers STI’s techniques, trainings are held across the country, led by [[Melissa McCool|Ms. McCool]] and her colleagues, in person as well as through online webinars. Nephrology social workers who participated in a 2014 study of the effectiveness of STI webinar trainings found the trainings to be very useful and wanted them to continue.&lt;ref&gt;McCool, Melissa; Boyd, Shaun; Aebel-Groesch, Kathy; Gonzalez, Teresa; Evans, Deborah (2014) [http://www.nephrologynews.com/articles/110201-symptom-targeted-intervention-webinar-trainings-feedback-from-participants "Symptom targeted intervention webinar trainings: Feedback from participants".] ''Nephrology News and Issues'', June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

STI is used by medical practices and [[accountable care organization|Accountable Care Organization]]s (ACOs) for [[population health]] management and in [[integrated care]] and [[chronic care]]. STI provides curriculum, training, clinical assessment tools, and treatment plans for these organizations through 20 min win, a system that allows patient issues, identified in required biopsychosocial care plans, to be addressed in 20-minute sessions.

==Research==
In 2011, STI was assessed by [[nephrology]] social workers in 17 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Melissa |last1=McCool |first2=Stephanie |last2=Johnstone |first3=Renata |last3=Sledge |first4=Beth |last4=Witten |first5=Michelle |last5=Contillo |first6=Kathryn |last6=Aebel-Groesch |first7=Jim |last7=Hafner |journal=Nephrology News and Issues |pmid=21608458 |url=http://www.nephrology-digital.com/201105/201105/17/0 |year=2011 |title=The promise of symptom-targeted intervention to manage depression in dialysis patients—part 1 |volume=25 |issue=6 |pages=32–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sledge Renata, Aebel-Groesch Kathryn, McCool Melissa, Johnstone Stephanie, Witten Beth, Contillo M, Hafner James | year = | title = The promise of Symptom Targeted Intervention (STI) in improving mood and quality of life outcomes in dialysis patients—part 2 | url = http://www.nephrology-digital.com/201106/#&amp;pageSet=13 | journal = Nephrology News and Issues | volume = 25 | issue = 7| pages = 24–31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Results suggested that STI further enhances existing social work skills in identifying, treating, and tracking outcomes of patient issues requiring clinical intervention. Most of the social workers spent 1.5 hours over a six-week period using STI to address symptoms of depression with a patient. This short period of intervention led to a reported improvement in physical component summary and mental component summary scores (part of the [[SF-36|Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)]] patient evaluation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rand.org/health/surveys_tools/mos/mos_core_36item.html 36-Item Short Form Survey from the RAND Medical Outcomes Study]&lt;/ref&gt;) in 51% and 64% of patients, respectively, and improvement in [[List of diagnostic classification and rating scales used in psychiatry|CES-D]] scores in 72.1% of patients. In 2013, a pilot program showed that using STI's techniques helped increase patients' adherence to treatment recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;Johnstone, Stephanie (2013). [http://www.renalbusiness.com/articles/2013/10/helping-patients-manage-treatment-recommendations.aspx "Helping patients manage treatment recommendations".] ''Renal Business Today.''&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}

A 2013 study with [[DaVita]] Clinical Research, published at the National Kidney Foundation meeting in April 2014, showed statistically significant improvements in quality of life and depression scores for patients receiving STI. There were 91 participants in the study.  Statistically significant improvement occurred in KDQOL-36 mental component scores (p &lt; 0.001), physical component scores (p = 0.042), as well as burden (p &lt; 0.001) and effects (p = 0.001) domain scores. Statistically significant improvement also occurred in patients' CES-D 10 scores (p &lt; 0.001).&lt;ref&gt;Boyd S, Dunn D, Aebel-Groesch K, Evans D, Gonzalez T, Burgess M, Howard T, Mutell R, McCool M (2014). [http://www.davitaclinicalresearch.com/publication/treating-depression-in-the-dialysis-setting-validating-symptom-targeted-intervention-2 "Treating depression in the dialysis setting: validating Symptom Targeted Intervention".] DaVita Healthcare Partners Inc./STI Innovations.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an ongoing study conducted by [[Fresenius Medical Care|Fresenius]] Medical Care, the use of STI, along with other clinical interventions, was shown to decrease missed treatments, decrease hospitalizations and improve quality of life indicators and depression scores. The baseline number of missed treatment rate (per month) was 1.7 (±1.3) vs. 0.9 (±1.0) post-intervention (p &lt; 0.0001). The number of hospitalization was 0.4 (±0.8) vs. 0.2 (±0.8) per month for pre- and post-intervention, respectively, (p = 0.07). Significant improvement was found in CES-D 10 and KDQOL-36 domain scores except for physical component scores. Sleep-quality barriers and stressors also indicated significant improvement (except for restless legs and stressors related to health symptoms or loss/grief). Preliminary results indicated that an intensive social worker-initiated intervention program was able to reduce unexcused missed treatments in the short term (three months). Indicators of quality of life and well-being that potentially contributed to the non-adherent behavior also improved, which may help sustain the favorable results over the long term.&lt;ref&gt;Johnstone S, Li N, Maddux F, Weissman-Hunt A, Quintana D, Lacson Jr. E (2014) [http://esrdnet5.org/Files/Patient-Services/PE-LAN/2014/MissedTreatments2014/MT-Adherence.aspx  "Social worker-driven program to reduce hemodialysis therapy non-adherence".] Fresenius Medical Care North America.&lt;/ref&gt;

Results of a 2015 study by [[Melissa McCool|Ms. McCool]] and colleagues at [[DaVita]] HealthCare Partners suggested that implementation of a social worker-based STI clinical program targeting improved quality of life for in-center hemodialysis patients led to health improvements due to increased adherence to the prescribed dialysis treatment regimen in the least-compliant patients.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd S, Aebel-Groesch K, Dunn D, Remington J, McCool M, Benner D. [https://web.archive.org/web/20150530012209/http://ww2.aievolution.com/nkf1501/index.cfm?do=abs.viewAbs&amp;abs=1351 "Symptom Targeted Intervention Decreased Missed Treatment in Hemodialysis Patients"]. National Kidney Foundation Spring Clinical Meeting, Charlotte, NC, March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; A poster presenting the results received best poster award at the [[National Kidney Foundation]] spring 2015 meeting. A pilot study using STI with transplant patients at the [[Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh]] was completed in 2014, and a poster presenting the results was included in the British Renal Society's annual meeting in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;McCool M, Rathjen M, Boyd B (2015) [http://www.postersessiononline.com/173580348_eu/congresos/brs2015/aula/-P_125_brs2015.pdf "Qualitative pilot study on the value of Symptom Targeted Intervention (STI) in decreasing symptoms of depression and anxiety with renal and transplant patients, Royal Infirmary Edinburgh".] British Renal Society Annual Conference.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further studies are under way on the effectiveness of STI in patients with a variety of chronic diseases, including an ongoing multi-center IRB-approved research study involving the University of Maryland, University of Utah, and University of Minnesota, on the use of STI with solid organ transplant recipients.

[[File:valleyofdrums.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Valley of the Drums]], a toxic waste site in Kentucky, United States, 1980.]]
'''Toxic waste''' is any unwanted material in all forms that can cause harm (e.g. by being inhaled, swallowed, or absorbed through the skin). Many of today's household products such as televisions, computers and phones contain toxic chemicals that can pollute the air and contaminate soil and water. Disposing of such waste is a major public health issue.

==Classifying toxic materials==
Toxic materials are poisonous byproducts as a result of industries such as manufacturing, farming, construction, automotive, laboratories, and hospitals which may contain [[heavy metals]], [[radiation]], dangerous [[pathogen]]s, or other [[toxin]]s. [[Toxicity|Toxic]] waste has become more abundant since the [[industrial revolution]], causing serious global health issues. Disposing of such waste has become even more critical with the addition of numerous technological advances containing [[toxic compound|toxic chemical components]]. Products such as [[cellular telephone]]s, computers, [[TV set|televisions]], and [[solar panel]]s contain toxic chemicals that can harm the environment if not disposed of properly to prevent the pollution of the air and contamination of soils and water. A material is considered toxic when it causes death or harm by being inhaled, swallowed, or absorbed through the skin.

The waste can [[chemical waste|contain chemicals]], [[Toxic heavy metal|heavy metals]], radiation, dangerous pathogens, or other toxins. Even households generate [[hazardous waste]] from items such as batteries, [[e-waste|used computer equipment]], and leftover paints or pesticides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/toxic-waste-overview/|title=Toxic Waste|date=2016-05-03|work=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toxic material can be either human-made and others are naturally occurring in the environment. Not all hazardous substances are considered toxic.

The [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) has identified 11 key substances that pose a risk to human health:
* '''[[Arsenic]]:''' used in making electrical circuits, as an ingredient in [[pesticides]], and as a [[wood preservative]]. It is classified as a [[carcinogen]].
* '''[[Asbestos]]:''' is a material that was once used for the insulation of buildings, and some businesses are still using this material to manufacture [[roofing material]]s and [[brake]]s. Inhalation of asbestos fibers can lead to lung cancer and [[asbestosis]].
* '''[[Cadmium]]:''' is found in [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] and [[plastics]]. It can be inhaled through [[cigarette smoke]], or digested when included as a [[food coloring|pigment in food]]. Exposure leads to lung damage, irritation of the digestive track, and [[kidney disease]].
* '''[[Chromium]]:''' is used as brick lining for high-temperature industrial furnaces, as a solid metal used for making steel, and in [[chrome plating]], manufacturing [[dye]]s and pigments, wood preserving, and [[leather tanning]]. It is known to cause cancer, and prolonged exposure can cause chronic [[bronchitis]] and damage lung tissue.
* '''[[Clinical waste]]s:''' such as syringes and medication bottles can spread pathogens and harmful microorganisms, leading to a variety of illnesses.
* '''[[Cyanide]]:''' a poison found in some pesticides and [[rodenticide]]s. In large doses it can lead to [[paralysis]], [[convulsions]], and respiratory distress.
* '''[[Lead]]:''' is found in batteries, paints, and [[ammunition]]. When ingested or inhaled can cause harm to the nervous and reproductive systems, and kidneys.
* '''[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]]:''' used for [[dental filling]]s and batteries. It is also used in the production of [[chlorine gas]]. Exposure can lead to [[birth defects]] and kidney and brain damage
* '''PCBs''', or [[polychlorinated biphenyls]], are used in many manufacturing processes, by the utility industry, and in paints and [[sealant]]s. Damage can occur through exposure, affecting the nervous, reproductive, and immune systems, as well as the liver.
* '''POPs''', [[persistent organic pollutant]]s. They are found in chemicals and pesticides, and may lead to nervous and reproductive system defects. They can [[bio-accumulate]] in the food chain or persist in the environment and be moved great distances through the atmosphere.
* '''Strong acids and alkalis''' used in manufacturing and industrial production. They can destroy tissue and cause internal damage to the body.

The most overlooked toxic and hazardous wastes are the [[household waste|household]] products in everyday homes that are improperly disposed of such as old batteries, pesticides, paint, and car oil. Toxic waste can be reactive, ignitable, and corrosive. In the United States, these wastes are regulated under the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (RCRA).&lt;ref name="RCRA statute"&gt;United States. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, {{uspl|94|580}}, {{USStat|90|2795}}, {{USC|42|6901}}. Approved 1976-10-21.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Reactivity (chemistry)|Reactive]] wastes are those that can cause explosions when heated, mixed with water or compressed. They can release toxic gases into the air. They are unstable even in normal conditions. An example is [[lithium–sulfur battery|lithium–sulfur batteries]].
* [[Ignitibility|Ignitable]] wastes have flash points of less than 60 degrees Celsius. They are very combustible and can cause fires. Examples are solvents and waste oils.
* [[Corrosive]] wastes are liquids capable of corroding metal containers. These are acids or bases that have pH levels of less than or equal to 2, or greater than or equal to 12.5. An example is [[battery acid]].

With the increase of worldwide technology, there are more substances that are being considered toxic and harmful to human health. Some of this technology includes cell phones and computers. Such items have been given the name [[e-waste]] or EEE, which stands for Electrical and Electronic Equipment. This term is also used for goods such as refrigerators, toys, and washing machines. These items can contain toxic components that can break down into water systems when discarded. The reduction in the cost of these goods has allowed for these items to be distributed globally without thought or consideration to managing the goods once they become ineffective or broken.

In the US, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and state environmental agencies develop and enforce regulations on the storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous waste. The EPA requires that toxic waste be handled with special precautions and be disposed of in designated facilities around the country. Also, many US cities have collection days where household toxic waste is gathered. Some materials that may not be accepted at regular landfills are ammunition, commercially generated waste, explosives/shock sensitive items, hypodermic needles/syringes, [[medical waste]], radioactive materials, and smoke detectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Toxic Waste |last=Vaughn |first=J |year=2013 |isbn=9780765682932 |location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health defects==

Toxic wastes often contain [[carcinogen]]s, and exposure to these by some route, such as leakage or evaporation from the storage, causes cancer to appear at increased frequency in exposed individuals. For example, a [[cancer cluster|cluster]] of the rare blood cancer [[polycythemia vera]] was found around a toxic waste dump site in northeast Pennsylvania in 2008.&lt;ref name="NEPennsylvania"&gt;{{cite journal | author = MICHAEL RUBINKAM | title = Cancer cluster confirmed in northeast Pennsylvania | journal = Associated Press | url = https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080826/ap_on_sc/toxic_dump_fears | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Human &amp; Ecological Risk Assessment Journal conducted a study which focused on the health of individuals living near municipal landfills to see if it would be as harmful as living near hazardous landfills. They conducted a 7-year study that specifically tested for 18 types of cancers to see if the participants had higher rates than those that don’t live around landfills. They conducted this study in western Massachusetts within a 1-mile radius of the North Hampton Regional Landfill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Goodman Julie E., Hudson Todd C., Monteiro Richard J. | year = 2010 | title = Cancer Cluster Investigation In Residents Near A Municipal Landfill | url = | journal = Human &amp; Ecological Risk Assessment | volume = 16 | issue = 6| pages = 1339–59 | doi=10.1080/10807039.2010.526504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People encounter these toxins buried in the [[soil contamination|ground]], in stream runoff, in [[groundwater contamination|groundwater]] that supplies drinking water, or in floodwaters, as happened after Hurricane Katrina. Some toxins, such as mercury, persist in the environment and accumulate. As a result of the [[bioaccumulation]] of mercury in both [[freshwater ecosystem|freshwater]] and [[marine ecosystem]]s, [[predatory fish]] are a significant source of mercury in human and animal diets.&lt;ref name="environment.nationalgeographic.com"&gt;"Toxic Waste."

==Handling and disposal==
{{main|Hazardous Waste Disposal}}
{{refimprove section|date=October 2011}}
One of the biggest problems with today's toxic material is how to dispose of it properly. Before the passage of modern environmental laws (in the US, this was in the 1970s), it was legal to dump such wastes into streams, rivers and oceans, or bury it underground in [[landfill]]s. The US [[Clean Water Act]], enacted in 1972, and RCRA, enacted in 1976, created nationwide programs to regulate the handling and disposal of hazardous wastes.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 ("Clean Water Act"). {{uspl|92|500}}, October 18, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author-last=Copeland |author-first=Claudia |date=2016-10-18 |title=Clean Water Act: A Summary of the Law |url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL30030.pdf |publisher=U.S. Congressional Research Service |location=Washington, D.C. |id=RL30030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agriculture industry uses over 800,000 tons of pesticides worldwide annually that contaminates soils, and eventually infiltrates into groundwater, which can contaminate drinking water supplies. The oceans can be polluted from the [[surface runoff|stormwater runoff]] of these chemicals as well. Toxic waste in the form of petroleum oil can either spill into the oceans from pipe leaks or large ships, but it can also enter the oceans from everyday citizens dumping car oil into the rainstorm sewer systems. Disposal is the placement of waste into or on the land. Disposal facilities are usually designed to permanently contain the waste and prevent the release of harmful pollutants to the environment.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

The most common hazardous waste disposal practice is placement in a land disposal unit such as a landfill, surface impoundment, waste pile, land treatment unit, or injection well. Land disposal is subject to requirements under EPA's Land Disposal Restrictions Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/hw/land-disposal-restrictions-hazardous-waste |title=Land Disposal Restrictions for Hazardous Waste |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-08-16 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Injection wells are regulated under the federal [[Safe Drinking Water Act#Underground Injection Control (UIC) Program|Underground Injection Control]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/uic |title=Protecting Underground Sources of Drinking Water from Underground Injection |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-05-09 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organic wastes can be destroyed by [[incineration]] at high temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etc.org/advanced-technologies/high-temperature-incineration.aspx|title=High Temperature Incineration|publisher=''Environmental Technology Council''|accessdate=September 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the waste contains [[heavy metals]] or [[radioactive isotopes]], these must be separated and stored, as they cannot be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/hw/regulatory-exclusions-and-alternative-standards-recycling-materials-solid-wastes-and-hazardous |title=Regulatory Exclusions and Alternative Standards for the Recycling of Materials, Solid Wastes and Hazardous Wastes |date=2017-08-10 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method of storage will seek to immobilize the toxic components of the waste, possibly through storage in sealed containers, inclusion in a stable medium such as glass or a cement mixture, or burial under an impermeable clay cap. Waste transporters and waste facilities may charge fees; consequently, improper methods of disposal may be used to avoid paying these fees. Where the handling of toxic waste is regulated, the improper disposal of toxic waste may be punishable by fines&lt;ref name="environment.nationalgeographic.com"/&gt; or prison terms. Burial sites for toxic waste and other contaminated [[brownfield land]] may eventually be used as [[Urban open space|greenspace]] or redeveloped for commercial or industrial use.

===History of US toxic waste regulation===
{{Overly detailed|section|date=August 2017}}
RCRA governs the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste.&lt;ref name="RCRA basics"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/hw/learn-basics-hazardous-waste |title=Learn the Basics of Hazardous Waste |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-08-16 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Toxic Substances Control Act]], also enacted in 1976, authorizes EPA to collect information on all new and existing chemical substances, as well as to control any substances that were determined to cause unreasonable risk to public health or the environment.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Toxic Substances Control Act. {{uspl|94|469}}, approved 1976-10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EPA TSCA"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/chemicals-under-tsca |title=Chemicals under the Toxic Substances Control Act |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-06-28 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Superfund]] law, passed in 1980, created a cleanup program for abandoned or uncontrolled hazardous waste sites.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (commonly known as "Superfund"). {{uspl|96|510}}, approved 1980-12-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a long ongoing battle between communities and environmentalists versus governments and corporations about how strictly and how fairly the regulations and laws are written and enforced. That battle began in North Carolina in the late summer of 1979, as EPA's TSCA regulations were being implemented. In North Carolina, PCB-contaminated oil was deliberately dripped along rural Piedmont highways, creating the largest PCB spills in American history and a public health crisis that would have repercussions for generations to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncpcbarchives.com/?page_id=144 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812171731/http://www.ncpcbarchives.com/?page_id=144 |archivedate=2016-08-12 |df= }}{{self-published source|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PCB-contaminated material was eventually collected and buried in a [[Warren County PCB Landfill|landfill in Warren County]], but citizens' opposition, including large public demonstrations, exposed the dangers of toxic waste, the fallibility of landfills then in use, and EPA regulations allowing landfills to be built on marginal, but politically acceptable sites.

Warren County citizens argued that the toxic waste landfill regulations were based on the fundamental assumption that the  EPA's conceptual dry-tomb landfill would contain the toxic waste. This assumption informed the siting of toxic waste landfills and waivers to regulations that were included in EPA's ''Federal Register.'' For example, in 1978, the base of a major toxic waste landfill could be no closer than  five feet from ground water, but this regulation and others could be waived. The waiver to the regulation concerning the distance between the base of a toxic waste landfill and groundwater allowed the base to be only a foot above ground water if the owner/operator of the facility could demonstrate to the EPA regional administrator that a [[leachate]] collection system could be installed and that there would be no hydraulic connection between the base of the landfill and groundwater. Citizens argued that the waivers to the siting regulations were discriminatory mechanisms facilitating the shift from scientific to political considerations concerning the siting decision and that in the South this would mean a discriminatory proliferation of dangerous waste management facilities in poor black and other minority communities. They also argued that the scientific consensus was that permanent containment could not be assured. As resistance to the siting of the PCB landfill in Warren County continued and studies revealed that EPA dry-tomb landfills were failing, EPA stated in its ''Federal Register'' that all landfills would eventually leak and should only be used as a stopgap measure.

Years of research and empirical knowledge of the failures of the  Warren County PCB landfill led citizens of Warren County to  conclude  that the EPA's dry-tomb landfill design and regulations governing the disposal of toxic and hazardous waste were not based on sound science and adequate technology. Warren County's citizens concluded also that North Carolina's ''1981 Waste Management Act'' was scientifically and constitutionally unacceptable because it authorized the siting of toxic, hazardous and nuclear waste facilities prior to public hearings, preempted local authority over the siting of the facilities, and authorized the use of force if needed.&lt;ref name="ncpcbarchives.com"&gt;.&lt;http://www.ncpcbarchives.com {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207182404/http://ncpcbarchives.com/ |date=2011-02-07 }}&gt;.{{self-published source|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the Warren County protests, the 1984 Federal Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act focused on waste minimization and phasing out land disposal of hazardous waste as well as corrective action for releases of hazardous materials. Other measures included in the 1984 amendments included increased enforcement authority for EPA, more stringent hazardous waste management standards, and a comprehensive underground storage tank program.&lt;ref name="RCRA summary"&gt;
{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-resource-conservation-and-recovery-act |title=Summary of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-12-01 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disposal of toxic waste continues to be a source of conflict in the U.S. Due to the hazards associated with toxic waste handling and disposal, communities often resist the siting of toxic waste landfills and other waste management facilities; however, determining where and how to dispose of waste is a necessary part of economic and environmental policy-making.&lt;ref name="ncpcbarchives.com"/&gt;

The issue of handling toxic waste has become a global problem as international trade has arisen out of the increasing toxic byproducts produced with the transfer of them to less developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Toxic_Waste.aspx|title=Toxic Waste Facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Toxic Waste|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights began to notice the illicit dumping of toxic waste and assigned a Special Rapporteur to examine the human rights aspect to this issue (Commission resolution 1995/81). In September 2011, the Human Rights Council decided to strengthen the mandate to include the entire life-cycle of hazardous products from manufacturing to final destination (aka cradle to grave), as opposed to only movement and dumping of hazardous waste. The title of the Special Rapporteur has been changed to the “Special Rapporteur on the implications for human rights of the environmentally sound management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes."(Human Rights Council 18/11). The Human Rights Council has further extended the scope of its mandates as of September 2012 due to the result of the dangerous implications occurring to persons advocating environmentally sound practices regarding the generation,management, handling, distribution and final disposal of hazardous and toxic materials to include the issue of the protection of the environmental human rights defenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Environment/ToxicWastes/Pages/SRToxicWastesIndex.aspx|title=Special Rapporteur on Toxic Wastes|website=www.ohchr.org|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''UNESCO Chair of Telemedicine''' (UNES_CT) is a portion of [[UNESCO]] that was founded in 1999. It undertakes international activities related to the promotion of the information society and fights against [[technology transfer]] problems having the role of an “intermediate body”. The Chair is the first UNESCO Telemedicine Chair, and his activity is related with development and diffusion of [[Telemedicine]] and Information Society in Health Care in developing areas and undeveloped countries particularly [[South America|South-America]] and [[Africa]].

==Activities==
The expertise of the UNESCO chair of Telemedicine as a University Institution is based in the previous CATAI’s expertise founded in 1994 in the field of Information Society/[[Telemedicine]] with which is collaborating closely and from which received part of the sponsorship.

Activities include: training and teaching aspects, to gain a minimal structured knowledge in [[Medical Informatics]], have established the “Telemedicine Body of Knowledge” covering sociology, economics, technology transfer, technology and organizational issues, standardization, security and liability aspects in co-operation with the Universities of Queens-UK, Aveiro-PT, Belfast-IRL, Genova-IT, Innsbruck-AU, Udine-IT, Berlin-D, Athens-GR. CATAI published the first text-book of Telemedicine in English, complemented with a CD multimedia material particularly designed for developing countries, worldwide known by Winter and Summer Courses of Telemedicine training following the “Telemedicine Body of Knowledge". At the present moment the book is translated into 6 languages (SP, E, IT, GR, FR, D) and is published in Spanish (PanAmerican Editorial) with title : “Telemedicine” 2001.

At the present it includes the best practice implementation pilots in phone medicine (oncology -particularly home-care- and psychiatry -particularly childhood psychiatry), Tele-ECG and Tele-ultrasounds -particularly obstetrics and gynaecology.

First in the world (1991) to carry out distant DNA quantitation, it was applied to image analysis prognostic factors in breast cancer. Objective image analysis and prognostic factors have been incorporated into the regional breast cancer registry of 3000 patients (see above);

CATAI was the promoter of the Centre of Excellence in Telemedicine, sponsored by Science Park DG-XIII, with enrolment of 3 continents: Europe, Africa and America to concentrate best practice examples as well as top experts to implement real world applications and development of hardware-software systems ready to be used. These activities link mainly technological firms of the UK and Germany.

The UNESCO chair was leader of two [[European Union|EU]] projects (Leonardo-DG XXII ; Science Park-DGXIII) and participating in other two (DGXIII- Teleultrasound for developing countries; Leonardo-DGXXII Teaching Medical informatics).

[[File:Full of fresh vitality (2864879525).jpg|thumb|right|Vitality means Life]]
'''Vitality''' is [[life]], life force, [[health]], [[youth]], or ability to live or exist. The word vitality is derived from the Latin word ''vita'', which means "life."

== Jainism ==
According to [[Jain philosophy]], there are ten vitalities or life-principles:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pujyapada (Shri.)|editor=S. A. Jain|title=Reality|date=1960|publisher=Vira Sasana Sangha|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=uRIaAAAAMAAJ|archive-url=https://archive.org/details/Reality_JMT|archive-date=2015|quote=Not in Copyright}}&lt;/ref&gt;-
*The five senses
**Touch
**Taste
**Smell
**Sight
**Hearing
*Energy
*Respiration
*Life-duration
*The organ of speech
*The mind

The table below summaries the vitalities, living beings possess in accordance to their senses.{{sfn|Jain|2012|pp=34–35}}

According to major [[Jain text]], [[Tattvarthsutra]]: "The severance of vitalities out of passion is injury".{{sfn|Jain|2012|pp=34–35}}

==Urban planning==
In the context of urban planning, that vitality of a place is its capacity to grow or develop its liveliness and level of economic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/general/glossaryandlinks/glossary/v|title=Planning Portal – Planning Portal Glossary: V|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2927">'''Wellness in School''' is offered as a unit in some K-8 elementary schools in the United States. It is defined as the quality or state of being in good [[health]], especially as an actively sought goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wellness |title=Wellness - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wellness is taught in 6 or 7 dimensions: physical, social, intellectual, emotional, occupational, spiritual and environmental. Inclusion of the latter two is controversial.&lt;ref name=kblog&gt;{{cite web|author=Kathy on 1/04/2010 |url=http://kblog.lunchboxbunch.com/2010/01/defining-wellness-hettlers-six.html |title=Defining Wellness: Hettler's Six Dimensions.

The following isn't an expanded definition of each, but simply what the goals and objectives are for each dimension.

==Physical==
The physical dimension focuses on three sub-categories: healthy eating,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.choosemyplate.gov/food-groups/downloads/MyPyramid_Getting_Started.pdf MyPyramid]&lt;/ref&gt; exercise, and the human body (digestive system, skeletal system and circulatory systems).

==Intellectual==
For K-5 the focus can be on the brain controlling the body, all the way up to studying the parts of the brain. Students are expected to understand that different parts control different body functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/lobe.html |title=Neuroscience For Kids - lobes of the brain |publisher=Faculty.washington.edu |date=1998-09-13 |accessdate=2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spiritual==
Students learn techniques to harmonize their actions with the world around them.

==Emotional==
Students learn to identify negative and positive emotions and coping strategies.

==Occupational==
Students learn to connect the job they want with the necessary preparation.

==Social==
Students learn the importance and skills of communication.

==Environmental==
Students learn to connect their own and their family's actions to the health of the environment around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wellness.ucr.edu/environmental_wellness.html |title=Wellness: Environmental Wellness |publisher=Wellness.ucr.edu |date=2012-09-27 |accessdate=2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
